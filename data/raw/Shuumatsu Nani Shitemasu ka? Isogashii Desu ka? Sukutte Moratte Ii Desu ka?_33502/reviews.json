            "content": "Did you ever get that feel of \"this could be great if\" while reading or watching something? This feel is exactly what this anime is about. A story with huge potential, but undermined. Undermined by the author's lack of proper writing skills. By conventions of a degenerated form of writing. And by a not so good adaptation.\r\nThis show can pass by as your average light novel adaptation with ease. Hella long title you won't remember no matter what. A cast of characters with names difficult to read or memorize. Male MC that shoves up people's ass his set of morals once in a while. MC'slove interest that goes melodramatic and cry several times. Yet you can find here the tragedy of a man. A man that lost everything, and ends up in some state of suspended animation until he is awaken many years later in a \"foreign\" world (Captain America, huh?). The cute heroine is actually a weapon of mass destruction that can die any time for the sake of the world. High stakes for the love interests and the risk of emotional loss could make this a great love story, right?\\n\\n\r\nProblem is, the show couldn't decide whenever it wanted to be a dull light novel adaptation or a good story. This leaded to a confusing presentation and lack of self-awareness. Say, they present you with a little depth of Willem's character. It is reedeming and set him as a \"not your typical LN male MC at all\". And, show a few seconds later one of the most cringe-inducing reactions that a plain tsundere girl can have. Breakdowns like this are destructive to suspension of disbelief.\\n\\n\r\nBut in the long run, the show saves itself from the mediocrity valley. Remember the love story? What blooms here is the most organic romance I have seen in anime, at least in a while. Never two people falling in love with each other felt so natural. Chtholly (I swear I didn't look up the character list) slowly evolves into a housewife in hopes to become a better person for Willem. Willem in turn tries to overcome his own fears of another loss so he can give Chtholly the love she deserves. Both of them reach the stage of mutual love step by step. It's simple, but it works.\\n\\n\r\nThe show goes up and down since episode one, between LN's conventions and good writing. There's a immersive post-apocalyptic setting. A well-tied set of emotional stakes, great OST and some gorgeous visuals. But there are one-sided characters, with single tropes defining them. Also a typical LN setup, and some crappy CGI.\\n\\n\r\nAs bad as this series might sound, it's good enough. At least, the LN medium isn't completely doomed. The guy who wrote this is talented, but needs to polish his skills and broaden his writing experience, which seems narrow yet.\\n\\n\r\n\"How do you fall in love at the end of the world?\" - This alone would be a better name, although still long. Keep your titles short and easy to read they say. The name \"SukaSuka\" means nothing to me. So how I'm supposed to call for this show?",

            "content": "(Please note, there are many spoilers in this review)\r\nI typed up probably seven different openers for this review before realizing that nothing I say can possibly prepare you for what's to come. This introduction, or lack thereof, actually goes on to mimic the underlying themes of this series in more ways than one. WorldEnd (Which also goes by the incredibly long title of 'What Are You Doing At The End Of The World? Are You Busy? Will You Save Us?') is more than just the hyperdramatic adaptation of a light novel going by the same name, it's a story about never being prepared; it's astory about how everything in life comes and goes far too quickly for us to comprehend. But, at the same time, so much of the beauty in life can only be leeched from it due to its apparent absence in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nWorldEnd is a series that can, by no means, be nailed down to one general concept. The scope of its meaning is as vast as the world it takes place in -- a world in which humanity has all but vanished. The remaining life forms have taken to the skies, building civilizations upon floating islands and relying on creatures known as 'Leprechauns' to fight in a never-ending war. The leprechauns in WorldEnd, however, are not your typical Irish, fun-loving drunkards. Instead, they are girls born from children who died before having anything to live for, and the main leprechaun who we follow throughout WorldEnd goes by the name Ctholly Nota Seniorious.\\n\\n\r\nCtholly initially comes off as a sort of aloof, curious girl, struggling to fit in with a world full of disfeatured humanoids. The irony in this, however, is that those without extreme physical deformities (Or those who appear human) are actually the ones known as the 'disfeatured' in WorldEnd. Partway through the pilot, we are also introduced to the second protagonist, Willem Kmetsch, as he encounters Ctholly for the first time. After showing her around the island for a bit, Ctholly departs and Willem is left on his own. Having recently fallen on hard times, he reluctantly takes on a job as the caretaker for a nearby military facility. Of course, he doesn't really understand what he's getting himself into until he shows up and it's less of a warehouse and more of an orphanage full of young girls. And while this seems like a pain to him at first, his attitude takes a dramatic shift when he realizes that these girls are the only weapons civilization has left.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the first sign of tragedy out of many. Yes, the idea of young girls being used as weapons is rather unfortunate and incredibly sad. But throughout the next eleven episodes, the series begins to steamroll down a path in which we grow attached to every single one of them only to have those relationships severed and beaten by the end of the series. The most dramatic of all of these relationships, however, is the budding romance that slowly begins to flourish between Ctholly and Willem.\\n\\n\r\nWithout giving away everything, something happens to Ctholly that begins to drain her sanity. Slowly but surely, her memories begin to fade and her hair begins to change colors, turning into a violent shade of red instead of her normal, subtle blue. The shift in hair colors is not just a shift in appearance, however. This physical change mimics the drastic mental change that is occurring within her at the same time. Ctholly is bombarded with confusing images and the voice of tortured young girl, speaking in eerie metaphors. And while none of what this voice is saying makes sense to us, the sheer manner in which they are said is enough to signify the deterioration of her psyche. The worst part of this is that Ctholly knows what's happening to her.\\n\\n\r\nDay after day, Ctholly remembers less of herself and clings tightly to the one thing she knows for sure -- that she's in love. She tosses aside her slightly-tsun outlook from earlier in the series and simply adopts the fact that she loves Willem, making it known to him every chance she gets. And while he spends a decent amount of time avoiding the subject, it's clear that Willem feels the same way. The steamrolling tragedy that we all know is coming screeches to a halt and, for just the slightest moment, everything is perfect. \\n\\n\r\nBut then it's not.\\n\\n\r\nWillem takes Ctholly to a nearby military ship after catching wind of a weapon that could help her fading consciousness. When tuning one of the other leprechauns weapons, however, he discovers something that stays with him for the rest of the series. The monsters that these girls have been fighting have actually been humans the entire time. And while exactly how that happened remains open to interpretation for us viewers, it's crystal clear to Willem. His vision and outlook become distorted and he begins to lose his grip on reality in a way both incredibly similar and incredibly different to Ctholly. \\n\\n\r\nThe final episode is like lighting -- it comes and it goes quicker than we're able to comprehend. Ctholly loses her grip on reality as battle breaks loose and slips into a coma. Willem, incapable of coping with the thought that this might be the end for her, erupts into a hate-fueled rage, slaughtering any monster he comes across as the rest of the army and several of the other leprechauns fight for their lives. One of the girls, Nephren, has a particularly harsh time with this, ultimately sacrificing herself so that a few others might live. Just as she collapses, however, Willem finds her. And, in a last-stitch effort so save something, he dives after her as she falls off of the airship.\\n\\n\r\nThe following five minutes go on to create one of the most heartbreaking and tear-inducing scenes I have ever seen. Ctholly manages to persuade the girl inhabiting her mind to let her come back to reality one last time -- all so she could save Willem. Then, as she stands surrounded by corpses on the edge of the airship, her last strands of blue hair change to red and she dives. Freefalling thousands of feet in the air, Scarborough Fair and the endless barrage of strange, psychological metaphors from Elq assault our ears and our hearts as we watch this girl we've fallen in love with trade away her sanity for someone else's happiness. A dual-monologue between Willem and Ctholly breaks out as she reappears out of thin air and desperately attacks the monsters surrounding him. As the monologue loses steam, Ctholly does as well. Her attacks slow as she is impaled by countless tendrils and lifted high up into the same sky she descended from just minutes ago.\\n\\n\r\nThe battle comes to a close and everything we have grown to love over the past three months is stripped from us quicker than it was given. The few scenes that follow only make it harder.\\n\\n\r\nIn Summary:\\n\r\nWhat an incredibly heartfelt and gorgeous series this was. The amount of love put into this project is palpable on all accounts and, thanks to one of the most well-written female characters in years, the mark that WorldEnd leaves will be a lasting one. The harmonious blend of intimate Celtic music meshed with tragic fight scenes and flawless acting creates something much more immersive than you would normally find in any visual medium. For a few seconds, it even feels like we're there. Something that important is hard to put into words, but if I had to limit my description of this series to one, it would be 'beautiful'. Please, set aside a night and watch this all in one go. You won't possibly regret it.",

            "content": "When you see a title this long, it really raises the question if the creator put as much as creativity into his work as they did into the title. The original light novel is 5 volumes long while the anime adaptation is 12 episodes. So in essence, it shouldn\u2019t be hard to adapt this into something fans can accept right? Well, that\u2019s not entirely easy to answer as this show isn\u2019t so easily recommendable to anyone. I will say this though, SukaSuka isn\u2019t your typical fantasy thriller that just jumps right into the action. In fact, it\u2019s far more than that as this series attemptsto craft a tearjerking fantasy drama to reach expectations.\\n\\n\r\nI have to admit, watching SukaSuka took me some time to accept the story. The first few episodes has an atmospheric feel with its world setting, characters, and plot. We meet Willem, the male protagonist who happens to be the last human in a post-apocalyptic world. The show makes it clear that humans are extinct as the anime opens up with a battle scene involving them and the Beasts. Flash forward into the present timeline and we see how the world has changed since then. Now there are floating islands that feel so isolated from each other despite being populated with otherworldly species. One of the most prominent of these species are the Leprechauns, characters who can wield ancient Dug weapons that can destroy Beasts. In the meantime, Willem meets Chtholly, a leprechaun with a mysterious past. The show establishes Willem as a friend, father figure, and comrade for the Leprechauns.\\n\\n\r\nRight off the bat, I can say that SukaSuka\u2019s characters are quite mysterious. Chtholly has a peculiar past that is explored throughout the show. Willem also has a past that I can say it\u2019s too pleasant to remember. Then, there are the Leprechauns. The show creates an eerie feel as it blends them with child innocence and unsettling fear. It\u2019s through revelations that Willem realizes what they really are and their roles in this series. Now, the more I got curious about the show, the more I wonder how the story plans to develop Willem and Chtholly\u2019s relationship. Thankfully, this series doesn\u2019t neglect their presence together and as each episode progresses, we learn more about the both of them. Character chemistry between Willem and Chtholly is also what I describe as charming that develops from friendship to romance. Willem also serves as a father figure for the younger Leprechauns. And in turn, the Leprechauns seems to grow really fond of him. This also brings a different side of the show as Willem realizes that the Leprechauns has a lack of fear. Because of this, the show makes it clear that Willem wants to avert any tragedy that can bestow on them. This goes to show how much Willem cares about the Leprechauns. It may also be possible that Willem doesn\u2019t want history to repeat itself because of the way humans were wiped out. Regardless of how others treat him, he hopes to be a light of hope in this post-apocalyptic world.\\n\\n\r\nAs a show with many species, you\u2019ll often see characters that are far from ordinary. Besides Leprechauns, there are also trolls, goblins, and many other type of characters with animal traits. This also brings a racial issue into the show. It puts Willem into a compromising position at times as certain races does not like his presence in their world. (for their own personal reasons) However, what I do find interesting about this series is Willem\u2019s main role. Does he play the role of a hero or someone that just wants to avoid tragedy again? It\u2019s hard to judge entirely based on the characterization alone so in retrospect, the show leaves it more open ended for viewers to decide. \\n\\n\r\nDespite my initial impression of SukaSuka, I still find that the show suffers from several problems that holds itself back. First, the show really doesn\u2019t avoid generic pitfalls you see in typical light novel adaptations. While the show has minimal fan service, it still has the cringe moments between Willem and various female characters. One particular trope (played out more as a joke) are the massages that attempts to make scenes sound much more lascivious than it appears to be. Not to mention, SukaSuka\u2019s comedy feels really dry at times. It hardly make me laugh and although I realize the show isn\u2019t built for that, it doesn\u2019t even manage to ever draw a chuckle from me. Furthermore, I can\u2019t really say the character relationship building outside of Willem/Chtholly to be worth mentioning. Oh and in terms of adaptation standards, the show does add some original content in attempt to make the story flow better. Does it really work out? That\u2019s for me to know and you to find out.\\n\\n\r\nTaking a look at the animation, I have to admit that SukaSuka captured the atmospheric setting right along with its world fiction. Essentially, the atmospheric setting brings a spiritual feel. The character designs also has variety with the wide range of different hair styles and colors; with a credible reason too beyond just being decorative especially for the Leprechauns. The action is captivating and feels magical with getting its point across. While the series doesn\u2019t have graphic violence, it does contain blood to show the dreadful feel of its story. The Beasts are also designed with a malevolent nature and some of them reminds me of Lovecraftian horror fiction. Character expressions is realistic and very human like with most of its characters.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is distinguishable with a combination of being melancholic, haunting, and cheerful. As I had expected, the theme songs are very moody with its choreography. The character voicing acting also connects well with their personalities in particular with Willem, Chtholly, and Grick. As most of the Leprechauns are quite young, stepping into the shoes of these characters is not easy. However, I am proud to say that the show captured their roles pretty damn well and make you connected to them.\\n\\n\r\nThe tenderness of this show is what attracted me to watching this. I have to admit, SukaSuka has a sublime-like creativity with its world setting and story. I wasn\u2019t too invested into the characters at first though over time, Willem and Chtholly\u2019s relationship started to really grown to me. Still, like most light novel adaptations these days, SukaSuka falls into the trap of generic tropes. Furthermore, I don\u2019t think this series is recommendable for anyone especially those that have less tolerance towards moody shows. I\u2019d still give it a try though. It\u2019s not a masterpiece but for a title that\u2019s longer than 3 sentences, it does earn more attention than that.\\n",

            "content": "This show is hard to talk about, because it's a sad story.  It's the story of how a promising show can be undermined by an unnecessary adherence to convention.  Oh, you thought I was talking about the plot of the show itself?\r\nAllow me to put this into perspective.  The Japanese light novel has a fair bit of history now, but allow me to be glib and say that they're a modern sort of pulp fiction.  Pulp fiction was a type of media engineered for popular entertainment.  It was printed in periodicals on cheap paper (the pulp in pulp fiction).If you were to simplify all fiction into either, \"genre fiction,\" or \"serious literature,\" pulp fiction was all the way on the genre end of the scale.  The medium gave rise to some storytelling trends of its own, such as the two-fisted tale.  Much of the same can be said about the modern Japanese light novel.\\n\\n\r\nThis show wears its light novel trappings on its sleeve.  This is apparent from the title alone.  It's entirely too long to remember, much less recite, inviting people to invent some marketing-friendly fan nickname.  It's set in another world.  There is exactly one guy in the main cast.  There are some vaguely-defined superpowers involved.  The main girl has long hair, at least past the mid-point of the back.  There are probably many more examples I could have listed here.\\n\\n\r\nVery little of this is obvious from the start of the show.  The first episode was so enjoyable and well-crafted that I paid these sorts of things no mind.  In retrospect, there were a few fears which had gathered, though I hadn't put words to them yet.  A good show draws you into its world, and lacks annoying distractions.  You aren't likely to think about this sort of thing during a good show.  However, the rest of the show wasn't up to the standard that first episode had set.  By the end of the fourth episode, I had put words to the fears, and found justification for them.\\n\\n\r\nThe first concerns the plot.  This is one thing which isn't necessarily light-novel-ish, and seems to be more like one of Key/Visual Arts' so-called \"utsuge,\" or \"crying games.\"  I disliked these sorts of stories for being emotionally manipulative.  They would unabashedly use cheap tricks to get you to feel sad.  Thus, the fear, \"Will they have these girls dying off one by one for cheap tears?\"  Now, a little tragedy isn't a bad thing.  However, the end of episode four was troubling.  Right after stirring the depths of main guy's trauma, main girl did a stupid anime rom-com thing and broke the tension.  Thus, at this point, I don't trust this show to handle tragedy appropriately.\\n\\n\r\nThat isn't even the only problem I have with the plot.  Main guy's backstory is presented a bit out of order such that it induces a bit of a plot hole.  It made it clear that he was there to see the destruction of the surface world, yet also that this occurred about 200 years ago, long enough that his native language has become a dead language.  How this is possible wasn't made clear until later.  Even though we can accept the explanation via willing suspension of disbelief, since it's arguably necessary for the story to exist, there remains the question of why it was presented in this haphazard way.\\n\\n\r\nThe setting has a bit of a similar issue, though it's more of a mixed bag.  The airborne cities are beautiful, and I'm happy to set aside questions of how such things exist to admire them.  The fact that they're filled with the so-called, \"featured,\" humans with animal traits, or maybe sentient human-like animals, is also interesting.  This actually creates a bit of a problem, since the story only deals with these things superficially.  I want to see more of the world outside the orphanage-prison, but the plot isn't really interested in these things.  The plot really only cares about the fairy-girls.  The \"featured\" seem to only exist to isolate them, and to not-so-subtly encourage the viewer to empathize with them.  You see, this is a harem show.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, it's a themed harem.  The theme?  Lolis.  Yes, inner cynic, the orphanage-prison really is a lolicon paradise.  It was a totally gratuitous fanservice shot, of one of the younger girls, that verified this for me.  The presentation is a bit misleading in this (Black Bullet was a lot more transparent).  It's even possible this wasn't the author's intent, but it's what we got anyway.  Main girl is supposedly 15, which should be outside the lolicon range, but she's drawn like the object of a hebephile's wet dream anyway.  In some other show, I might have written this off as her being the flat one, but it's hard to interpret her any other way in this context.  There is a full-grown woman around, but she's treated like a joke by the narrative and as a nuisance by the main guy.  It's normal for a harem show to feature a character, the \"harem nanny,\" whose purpose is to manage the harem; this is literally her job.  She is a walking TV tropes entry.\\n\\n\r\nSeveral of the other characters are easily dismissed in this way.  Nephren is the nigh-emotionless girl.  Ithea is the gadfly.  Chtholly, a.k.a. main girl, is the tsundere.  Up until the end of episode four, I had a better opinion of her.  After that, it's clear that being a tsundere is her defining character trait.  It would be easy to declare main guy, a.k.a. Willem, to be the typical slightly moody light novel protagonist.  For once, this seems to be a bit unfair.  His broodiness stems from understandable guilt and unresolved grief, and he doesn't seem to project the typical too-cool-to-care nonsense that generally goes with the archetype.  Whether he's as overpowered as the typical escapist protagonist remains to be seen, but the fact that he's been defeated at least once, and even shown as mostly helpless in the scope of the narrative, makes it hard to compare him to the likes of Tatsuya Shiba.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this show could have been something good.  This isn't mere speculation, as the first episode stands as testament to this potential.  It has aspects I like without reservation, such as the scenery porn and the soundtrack.  However, the medium of the source material, and the expectations associated with it, soiled it a bit.  There were too many annoying distractions to allow me to enjoy the good things.",

The op  and ed are extremely well done.... though its the scores and background music between the episodes which takes the cake.\\n\\n\r\nSo , in the end ... should u watch it.... yes... this anime has a surprisingly well written story which feels really fresh and ever since the first episode it creates an atmosphere of something about to happen which makes u wanna watch it more...this anime so far offers little to complain and much to praise... So i would recommend  everyone to watch this show if u haven't already .",

            "content": "SukaSuka is a post-apocalyptic fantasy anime that follows Wilhelm, a human that has been frozen for 500 years, who after being recovered finds out that humanity and the entire world has been decimated by some plant like beasts. He now lives with all the remaining races in some islands in the sky, and during one eventful day he conveniently meets a human looking girl and they spend the day with each other until it was time to depart home. After a few circumstances, mostly pertaining to his physical appearance, Wilhelm as tasked to take care of a certain place for the military which he accepts.When he gets there he is meet by a group of girls who live in an orphanage like building and it is revealed that they are fairies known as leprechauns who are the islands defence against the beast due to them being able to handle certain weapons that can fight against the beasts. \\n\\n\r\nThe first part of the series mostly focuses on wilhelm taking care of the girls along with Nygglatho a human looking women despite being a troll. There are a plethora of girls in the show, but most of them are young and get very little focus except one who serves more as an example for the way leprechauns are. The main girls are Chtholly, Nephren, and Ithea, but the story mostly focuses on Chyholly and Wilhelm and how they build a mutual relationship over the course of the show. The show also does some decent world building, or at least better than most fantasy anime. Many fantasy races live within close proximity to each other(  a common staple in most fantasy anime), but for this show it\u2019s not because they want to, but because they have to since the islands are the only safe places to be. Even then it doesn\u2019t hold will as there are some scenes of racial tensions between races especially against disfeatured due to how human looking they were. Some bits of a city's culture were explored due to how one race was influential to it. the orgin of the islands and leprechauns are looked into and how they came into being.the mechanics of the dug weapons are neat as well. However in the end it\u2019s at best decent since most of it is really skin deep due to the anime having to focus on the otherwise lackluster story. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is lackluster since the anime is overtly melodramatic throughout it\u2019s run time since it promises a tragedy at the end of its course and tries its best for the viewer to feel emotional in the end. The anime always tries to make sure of this with its focus on Chtholly, our tragic heroine of the show, as she has to undergo external internal mental struggles after her fight with the beasts. She was a decently written character, but it\u2019s a shame how most of it will be discarded in order for the show to make her death more tragic. Along with her on the ride is Wilhelm who is also a decently written character as the show goes through his past as a \u201cbrave\u201d, a group of generic heroes, and some of the things he\u2019s done that lead to the present despite being gone for 500 years. He has a easy going and collected attitude, but underneath that demeanor is someone with regrets and pain, and will do anything to make Chtholly and the other girls happy. However other than them not many other characters are that well fleshed out despite some of them having some importance to the story.\\n\\n\r\nProduction wise the show looks and sounds good. The art looks very standard as well as the character designs and setting. The animation was decent as well with mostly consistent quality throughout its run. Some notable parts for the art/animation are usually for the wings as well as Chtholly\u2019s mind scenes, but the downside would be how dull the beasts look. The sound for the show is good as well with many of the voice acting fitting thier roles. The Ost for the show is also good mostly to fit the tone of the scene, but sometimes it\u2019s allowed to be the only sound playing in order to set a certain atmosphere\\n\\n\r\nOverall there are alot of good things about this show when it comes to the production, and some of the ideas of the story. However the problem is what the story tries to focus on as well as how it tries to execute it. It\u2019s a show that tries to present something well meaning and emotional, but fails to deliver.",

            "content": "Despite the description, this anime isn't about a damaged man becoming a father figure to a bunch of cute, tragic little girls. It's about a forced romance between the adult male lead and a 15 year old main girl. It's masked as a father/daughter kind of relationship in the beginning, which only fuels my rage about it being turned into a romance that has the chemistry of drinking toothpaste with orange juice.\r\nWhat I assumed to be the core conflict of the series was the issue of using children as expendable weapons. In the end that didn't seem to be the case as the issue wassolved in less than an episode, with the main character going \"don't do it\" and that's pretty much it.\\n\\n\r\nThen there was the conflict of the main girl leaving for battle. It was obvious from the start that they wouldn't kill her off there but the fact that she was brought back not only within the very same episode as the death fake-out, but RIGHT AFTER the main character gets the news of her possible death. Their inability to hold the suspense for at least a single damned episode is cheap to say the very least.\\n\\n\r\nArt style is beautiful and the world-building had potential, all wasted in a story that is unable to focus on the aspects that would have truly been interesting to see develop further. All in all the anime is an unfocused mess that could have been great, had it not been for the whole forced romance plotline.",

            "content": "When a new anime season comes around; consumers of all tastes keep their eyes peeled for new fresh blood that can potentially have an impact on them and become a new favourite. As years have been going by it\u2019s been getting harder and harder to spot potentially good shows as generic titles embracing the mediums current tropes are flooding the seasonal charts and no signs suggest this will stop anytime soon. So when something comes around with a premise that highlights potential, it\u2019s understandable that people would get excited for it, especially if the source material has an existing fan base who are spreading aroundexhilaration for the adaptation. I am also one such consumer who looks out for potentially interesting shows that can stand out. I had my eyes peeled at an anime that I really thought could have been good. The production values were there, the premise was there, the potential was there. But as per normal with a lot of anime nowadays; the execution was not quite there. So this anime gets the honour of a review dedicated to how it missed the mark. And what is this special anime? Enter Sukasuka. A light novel adaptation that could have been good; except it wasn\u2019t.\\n\\n\r\nSukasuka had a nice set of ideas to become a good light novel adaptation. But the foundations weren\u2019t set right; the characters being the first problem. With a multitude of characters introduced in the first few episodes, the show should have explored them all a little more thoroughly to bring its themes to life. Furthermore, some side characters introduced in the latter half of the show lacked any authenticity and served only as plot devices for information on the plot without playing active roles as proper characters that can serve the themes and story.  The setting also had a lot of potential for some exploration on issues such as child soldiers, war, conspiracy and potentially other themes relating to the situation that the anime presented. There were plenty of instances where some side characters had potential to be explored to support the larger narrative and the setting, but the show opted to go for a more passive take on fantasy conflict by attempting to depict a romance between the two protagonists which isn\u2019t  necessarily a bad thing. It could have given it a unique edge against other anime in its genre that all rely on action as their main appeal to attract an audience, but it\u2019s unfortunate that the romance between the protagonists was poorly illustrated.\\n\\n\\n\r\n From the very first scene in the anime, the main male character Willem conveniently stumbles upon the main female character Chytolly and within an instant they go on a date together. From the beginning of the anime their relationship began on a forced note making it already feel unnatural as both characters fell for each other far too quickly and it could have benefitted the story more had the progression of their love felt natural and realistic. In effect, this makes the development between them not as engaging as it could have been and took away emotional value in later events. What also doesn\u2019t help the case is Chytolly\u2019s overabundance of emotional breakdowns which led to a lot of excessive melodrama that came off as unwarranted and annoying rather than genuine emotion that could also have made for some touching scenes if they weren\u2019t excessive and had the romance being good enough for me to care. The only sort of silver lining the romance between the protagonists has is some of the quirky dialogue the two share that managed to at least put a little smile on my face and it was quite endearing to see, but overall it\u2019s clear to see that the romance could have been portrayed with more care and its clumsiness is clearly visible.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIn contrast to the side characters, both of the protagonists as individual characters were fleshed out and developed. Each with their own dilemmas and this is the only worthy praise that I will give sukasuka excluding the audio-visuals. Chytolly\u2019s and Willem\u2019s traumas tied in with the central themes of the show and were also used as a way to reflect their progression to mutual love. As they got closer to conquering their ordeals, the more they fell in love with each other.  Also the subject matters of happiness, finding a place to call home, fighting for people you love and loosely family were all present as themes in sukasuka. They were all expanding upon and depicted thoroughly enough to make the backstories of the protagonists engaging. Its execution in this department was rather straight forward but satisfactory enough to get a pass mark. Everything the show aims to accomplish is brought together in a thematic sense and the relationship between the mains hits a surprisingly enjoyable and well produced emotional climax. But once again; its lack of care in the romance department hindered the emotional impact of the ending a little and it could have been far more emotionally gripping had the romance been depicted better. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe setting itself is what showed the most potential in sukasuka out of all its features. World-building is of utmost importance in a fantasy anime. In a story that doesn\u2019t take place in the world we know today, viewers have to be informed through the plot how the world works, how people in the world interact, the lore of the world and more. Sukasuka wasn\u2019t completely devoid of world building. On the surface level it had established an interesting world that set the stage for a tragic story.  The tragic backstory of the protagonist Willem was also tied in with the lore of the world to provide some much needed synergy between the characters and the setting, especially in a show that was lacking any sort of connection between the world and its characters.  What ultimately let the show down in this department was not using the full potential that its setting provided. It set the stage for some potential theme exploration on controversial topics that would have made for an interesting experience. The group of children Willem has been tasked to care for are all ancient weapons fielded off to face the enemy and misleads the audience into thinking this would be a very important plot point for the anime, but due to the direction the anime took this plot point was sidelined. As a result the show spent time on cheaply telling the audience on the dilemmas faced by the children rather than showing many consequences as a result of them being used as weapons of war.   \\n\\n\r\nBy far the best element of Sukasuka was the beautiful OST which was used to perfection. Placed in important and impactful scenes to heighten emotional impact and never overused to make the soundtrack feel redundant. Both the OP and ED were a pleasure to listen to and even work well as standalone listeners at any time. Alongside the audio the visuals also thrived. The show had a nice clear and neat colour palette that was exquisite to look at. The character designs were quite generic in appearance but were drawn neatly and attractive. Backgrounds were up to standard and the animation was quite good at times during some of the fight scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime certainly isn\u2019t an outright calamity. Compare it to most anime that air today and it will look like a gem to recent catastrophes like Eromanga-sensei. The ideas were all there. Under the hands of a more competent and experienced writer the show could have flourished into a fine fantasy anime. Yet it never set the foundations well enough for all of its ideas to wholly blossom which is a shame considering the show did have good intentions. Under the rubble it still has some merits to take away, and it\u2019s these positives that set this anime apart from the vast majority of light novel adaptations that are pumped out consistently every season. It is fully recommendable to hard core fantasy anime fans or just casual fans looking for an anime that offers some easily digestible entertainment. But it is instantly passible for experienced fans that are demanding more out of the medium than a simple romance story that isn\u2019t competent enough to do a satisfying job and would turn out rather average for those people. Sukasuka is not a bad show. But it simply has far too many shortcomings to be considered a success story.\\n",

            "content": "WorldEnd:What are doing at the end of the world?Are you busy?Will you save us? is quite a ride.  The title is long, but don't let it deter you from watching the anime.\r\nThe story is really emotional as it goes along.  It simply starts out with Willem being the last human alive after the rest dies out from a fight 500 years ago.  He was apparently frozen, but that isn't shown in the show.  He meets Chtholly while she is visiting Earth and they have a wonderful day together as he takes her to everything she wanted to see.  He endsup accepting a job as a technical officer for the military and he assigned to a floating island in the sky to care for a group of Leprechauns, whom are faeries who can use ancient Dug Weapons to drive away the Timere monsters that attack the lands.  The stuff that makes this show stand out is certainly the emotions and how the characters develop.  Even though he lost pretty much everything years ago, Willem quickly becomes accustomed to his new life as a care take for the children .  He rows along with the children every step of the way as he comes to realize the true nature of how they live their lives.  Chtholly takes a shrine to him pretty quickly as the two of them help each out in the roughest times and form a very touching relationship that demonstrates how much they are willing to do and sacrifice for each other.   The plot becomes a great story of tragic love as the two of them grow with each other, and other characters like Ithea and Nephren develop too.  Characters like Chtholly go through a lot of psychological trauma throughout the show and have to deal with part of themselves slipping away, in addition to dealing with other problems.  The ending is amazing and gives the show the tragic closure that you should expect to come. Overall, the story is very coherent and doesn't have all that many plot holes, but it does have a random episode in between that develops a character that's barely shown to be of any major importance later.  It easily gets a 8.5/10.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is just great too.  It's  not necessarily a mongatari type of stand out art, but it's still great art.  No matter if it's the memorable character designs, the backgrounds, weapons designs (you probably won't recognize the difference between each weapon, but they do look different for other ancient weapons in shows), the blending of hair colors, or even the different take on wing designs.  Faeries always have wings of some kind, but the ones here look almost mosaic like with their design.  In short, the art is great and stands out.  A 9/10 is deserved.  \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is amazing.  Every track complicated the scenes very nicely and they give off the feeling the show is meant to have.  The opening theme song is amazingly done.  The music is extremely pleasant to listen too and it sounds divine in a sense, and it's get across the tragedy and sadness that is everywhere throughout the anime and it has amazing visuals to go along with it.  This is technically an edit here for my my review since I wrote the review like 2 months or so ago from the date I'm changing my ending thoughts on the music.  10/10 for music.  At the time I wrote the review, I think I was just looking for a way to take off a minor amount of points because I didn't feel like this was a 9.4/10 show, but after thinking a little, I realized that swapping my sound and enjoyment scores  expresses my thoughts more accurately.  \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are great.  You really grow attached to them, especially Chtholly and Willem from a very point in the anime. Willem is basically the dad for all the Leprechauns he is in charge of, while Chtholly is more like their big sister.  Both of them have a lot more going on behind the scenes though and it starts to unravel as the plot goes forward.  Even Ithea and Nephren, and some of the younger faeries show personal growth along the way.  The story is filled with characters that just belong together.  Many of girls are examples of the cute girl on the outside, who has a lot of inner problems behind the scene and the way it's handled allows everyone else to grow alongside with the character experiencing trauma.  There are many characters that don't get much development, but they were younger side characters anyway.  Another 9/10 category.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I enjoyed this from start to finish and I never had a major feeling of dissatisfaction.  The ending cinches my enjoyment score since it is was so touching even though it was a tragic ending, but the show probably wouldn't be as good without the tragic closure.  My enjoyment earns a 9.5/10.  I recommend you watch this if you want to see some great character growth, great emotional and happy music, and all the good aspects of tragic love story all in one place.  I feel similarly about this show as I do about Angel Beats!, although, I enjoyed Angel Beats! slightly more but not enough to reflect it in my score since I'm not going to give .6-.9 as a score( no 9.6 for example) since it'll make my overalls core look weird.  I recommend you  watch Angel Beats! after this if you like Worldend of course, since both have similar vibes and quality.\\n\\n",

If you expect an action, or cliche, fanservice or moe, you go in wrong show.\r\nThis one story is one you called hidden gem\r\nWhy it called \"hidden gem\" because only some people can understand the meaning of this story that's why it beautiful\r\nI just want to copy one of the quote of this show main theme song\r\n\" I don't know the meaning of life, but I knowwhat's truly precious ~\"\\n\\n\r\nStory 10/10\\n\r\nThis is probably the best mixing of romance, slice of life,tragedy story that I ever watched in my entirely life. It's tell of slice of life, happiness and love. About a man who already lost everything then gained again then lost again. About a woman who finally find her happiness on the short moment of her life. About a man and a woman who love each other but no matter what happen, they wont' never be together. Even they lost their \"memories, even they lost all what they called themself and even on their \"empty shell\", their feelings will always stay in their heart.\\n\\n\r\nThe author/writer basically touch these two most important things on life :\\n\r\n1. Memories\\n\r\n2. A place where you called home/where you belong to\\n\\n\r\nAnd last thing, from episode 6 and onwards, this damn show trying to make you feel on every freaking episode\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10\\n\r\nArt kinda feel off on some episodes but kinda paid off with the atmosphere they build. Well it's not like the anime from godlike studio, so it understandable. It still very good and still got the feeling\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nThe music is making the anime more dramatic and tragic. The opening, ending and insert all dedicated for the main girl of the show. All the lyrics tell her feelings that she want to convey and story of how her struggle on her life, it describe her feelings and her story very well. Even the music is so sad and tragic. What's wrong with this show seriously?\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\r\nBecause this show is more to slice of life, the character development is expected to be strong on this kind of show. Yeah you will be see that, and it's too strong and sad the same time, every character have different perspective. The main character interaction is pure too. The main girl especially, it really hurt my heart where they can still and enjoy their life to the fullest on those cruel fate and become the \"happiest girl in the world\".\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nThough this kind of show is not suitable if you want some happy or cheering you mood after daily life of work/school, but I still enjoying the ride. This is one hell of emotion rides from start to end. If you love to read or have some hobby to read, try to see the LN, it have beautiful story, this kind of emotion ride is kinda rare to find on today era, so if you like this kind of genre too make sure to see it :)\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\r\nI'm glad I live long enough to see this hidden gem/rare show. Their tales, story, sorrow, tragedy and adventure will always in my heart :)\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Shuumatsu Nani Shitemasu ka? Isogashii desu ka? Sukutte Moratte Ii desu ka? otherwise known as SukaSuka\r\nSo let me begin by saying that I have completely put this anime on hold after watching the first episode of it around the time it came out in April/May.\r\nReasons to that was the first episode was kinda not that interesting to me. About a guy with a mysterious past takes a job to look after a bunch of lolis (wow amazing right?). \r\nNah what I mean is that, there were too many anime at the time coming out that were highly recommended that I simply couldn't care much ofSukaSuka after that, however 7 months later I continued SukaSuka and I can honestly say that I am so on another level glad that I did (literally feels bad not giving it a go the first time). Well to my surprise SukaSuka was so flipping amazing!. If it wasn't for the opening scenes of the first episode which made me more than enough curious to come back to it, then this anime would have been long gone from me. \\n\\n\r\nFrom there were do I begin? The music? geez the music was absolutely breathtaking, which ended up hitting me so hard towards the end of the series. You get this truly wonderful love story that inspires and builds throughout the anime, culminating till the very end which is executed in such a way that may seem extremely desolating at the end but gives the viewer so much more to imagine and take in (FEELS). All carried beautifully by an truly stunning soundtrack that elevates this anime to another level. That is thanks to Scarborough Fair performed by Tamaru Yamada (Hits so hard on the emotions I tell you).\\n\\n\r\nThe setting is a beautiful enigmatic world of numerous floating islands that are each home to small towns and are inhabited by animal humanoid-like people, to the dreaded surface that is filled with beasts being the reason why the races had to take it to the sky. The story behind this lies with what the humans had done centuries ago which in turn saw the demise of their race. There is no doubt a substantial amount of mystery throughout this anime and one watching would definitely consider that maybe they had missed a season or two before this, which is completely understandable. Yet this storytelling in this sense where the viewer is suddenly flug into the world is moderately rare. I am tired of anime series blatantly explaining the entire world in the first few episodes like an overly hyped New York times bestseller novel list of teen fantasy/sci-fi getting a Hollywood movie adaptation. This being a light novel the original creator had his hands in the adaption (Akira Kareno) so I fully trust that the 12 episodes is what was originally intended and hopefully a second season of this anime is on the horizon (please!).\\n\\n\r\nLittle things I really liked was that Willem was not portrayed throughout the show as a badass overpower warrior, he had more meaningful ways in protecting his love ones. The fact that this MC doesn't take centre stage is very refreshing. The world and lore isn't forced on you like most anime, I like the fact that throughout it is talked upon here and there leaving more mystery for us to piece things together about the world. There is this equilibrium of the cute funny side of Willem and the girls, to the more seriousness side of the state of the world which you can see during the time Willem spends with the girls and the battles the girls face respectively. The love story is slightly forced but in an understandable way to Chtholly\u2019s character being a young girl at that age where she is able to think for herself, especially after meeting someone (Willem) who she thought she will never see again. I mean there are so many other things that gets to me about this anime, that makes me want to come back to, especially the music.\\n\\n\r\nI can therefore say that SukaSuka has lowkey stolen my heart, has also made me reignite my love for anime. You know those endings that leaves you so empty as fuck BUT make you wish and wonder, that throws you in a room with your own interpretations and thoughts of what has happened and what will yet to come. Damn this anime made me laugh and most importantly cry so damn hard, that no anime has done for me to be completely honest.\\n\\n\r\nThis is my first review and i am completely new to MAL, because of this anime I just had to make an account.\\n",

            "content": "World End (aka SukaSuka) is not a bad show but it is a very unbalanced one.  It has it's good moments in front and back ends, but crammed in the middle is a lot of forgettable plot and characters.  Outside of the the leads, Wilhelm and Ctholly, I struggled to really even recall the names of the other characters.  While there are some interesting moments with the side characters, most notably Ithea, I mostly remember the characters by either their stereotypical trope and/or hair color.\r\nThe world the show has created is really fascinating and has a lot of potential.  It alsohas some great artwork and character designs.  But all that is wasted.  There are several episodes that are very much almost entirely filler and in a short 12 episode show, there is not much time to tell the narrative.  A lot of the fascinating parts of the story too, Wilhelm's and Ctholly's pasts are only very casually explored.  \\n\\n\r\nI understand that is that this show is ostensibly a romance set in a fantasy environment but I cannot for the life of me even recall why they have feelings for one another short of Wilhelm's almost pathological need to save someone and Ctholly for the first time seeing that there may be a reason to fear death because she wants to has things she wants to cherish.  Oh and then there is the awkward, completely-out-of-place orgasm scene.\\n\\n\r\nThe strength's of this show really is it's artwork and if you want to see some great visuals, this is a good one.  It also has a pretty good, albeit unresolved ending that finally delivers on some of the action that's teased in the beginning of the show and surprisingly neglected for the majority of the run.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the show is decent, but is ultimately very forgettable.  Having just finished the show during its original run, I am struggling to remember much of what occurred in the show.  If you're looking for a better told story with romance and fantasy elements, I'd recommend Re: Zero or Snow White with the Red Hair over this show.",

            "content": "The setup of this is the cutesy/anime version of Kazuo Ishiguro's book/movie \"Never Let Me Go\". Right from the start we have their moral dilemma; a few young people's deaths are perpetually necessary to protect the lives of the many. I don't know why this isn't mentioned more in the synopsis, it might have bagged a bigger adult viewership when you can only really see some cutesy pics and very limited info. I am enjoying it for this so far but it is a very large subjective matter to deal with. I hope they handle it carefully. It could easily degenerate into a \"save themand everything will be okay\" scenario which would make the original dilemma invalid.\\n\\n\r\nThe main trouble with the show is the motivation of the characters; their actions often don't make sense. There can often be no reason for their actions other than what the story needs to happen. Or, scenarios that seem important are ignored the whole epsiode. These things happen especially in episode 5.",

            "content": "I just love the synonym name of the anime: Suka-Suka\r\nIn my country, Suka-suka means like. It is a Bahasa Melayu language and a mother tongue for our citiziens. Google search it to know more.\r\nAt First, I don\u2019t plan to watch it, however the curiosity and the interest to watch this sparks in. Hence I decided to binge watch it for the first 4 episodes.\r\nAnd For that reason, I \u201csuka suka\u201d it, even though their title is quite long. \r\nThe pace of the plot is slow but is understandable, because to me it doesn\u2019t look like they rush the story, this is just based on myopinion since I didn\u2019t read their light novels. I love the plot of this anime where the setting takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where humanity has long gone extinct with only one sole human survivor remaining and has gone to slumber icy sleep for 500 years, and woke up to a world where furry creatures, fairies, goblins and lizards and etc. exists.  He adopts the post-apocalyptic life very well, though not the first few days when he woke up.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, the first moments of the first episode show the foreshadowing of what is going to happen in the final few episodes that will be aired soon, pretty early indication there. Another addition, is the comedy skits and moe moments added in the anime so that it doesn\u2019t make it look dark and gloomy series, just like 3 gatsu, the good thing is they don\u2019t put too much moe otherwise.\\n\\n\r\nThere is also romance setting in it, as Chtholly has romantic interest on Willem, I ship those two so bad till it sink. There were those moments when they show Chtholly and Willem scene, they\u2019re really cute together, even in the first episode. I second this.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation is amazing, artwork, character designs, background set up. I fancy this design, kudos to the drawing staffs who made the output of the anime pretty amazing. Studio Satelight is the studio in charge of this anime, and it already made few anime that I previously watched, one of it is Haruhi Suzumiya\u2019s spin off which is based more on Nagato Yuki. Very decent studio, hopefully they wont fuck this anime up.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP song and ED song are music to my ears, while the VA Selection are quite decent too, Willem voice actor is one of the highlights, with him still in debut year, he is doing quite well in his main role, hope he would get more main voice role in the upcoming future. Chtolly VA is one of the few VA I heard in the past anime, her roles are quite active and has decent and satisfying performance, overall most of the VA in it are very decent.\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend you guys to watch this anime, even though is more of drama, tragedy, romance genre type of setting, it has the slice of life feel to it too, and of course the fantasy since this takes place in the post-apocalyptic life, I\u2019m sure you guys would love it.\\n\\n\r\nWhat do you do at the end of the world?\\n\r\nAre you busy?\\n\r\nWill you save us?\\n\r\nDo you play Nintendo Switch?",

            "content": "I usually don't watch seasonals, moreover reviewing it the instant right after completing it, but for this occasions. I just can't help to do it. Yes, that's how \"Shuumatsu Nani Shitemasu ka? Isogashii desu ka? Sukutte Moratte Ii desu ka?\" or SukaSuka has tempt me by its bewitching allure. People may meme about how studio Trigger saved anime with their originals such as Inferno Cop, Kill la Kill, and other shows. But this word comes genuinely from my heart, without any sense of irony, in which that, SukaSuka is the flawed savior of anime.\r\nEnter Willem Kmetsch, a human survivor from the world destruction. As hemet Chtholly and worked as a carekeeper on her dormitory, he learned what does it takes to be a parent figure, and the importance of family itself.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the midst of superhero action anime and Light Novel adaptations with donkan overpowered protagonist which recently gets viral lately in terms of both popularity and quantity (or if I have to be more blunt, have plagued anime quality/is killing anime) yet I can never see much enjoyment or merit of them (such as Boku no Hero Academia, One Punch Man, and many other titles), experiencing SukaSuka is like finding a cure after being bit by 10 cobras. SukaSuka can be seen as a criticism for these types of anime but yet, it's still a really sincere work that doesn't come as being pompous on its criticism. It subverted the fundamental tropes of them. As much as I see the heroism theme portrayed in Boku no Hero Academia or being a donkan is the way to get girls attention are a total hypocrisy and delusional, I saw that the theme about heroism portrayed in SukaSuka as the most mature portrayal of it so far. The setting of SukaSuka is nothing new, but the implementations of it's core themes towards this kind of settings is what makes SukaSuka unique. I also found that this theme about family is rather barely explored in most anime so this is also where you can enjoy your stay for it.\\n\\n\r\nOur protagonist Willem, who now lives in a sky continent in a post-apocalyptic setting, begins like no more than your typical Light Novel self insert character. However, throughout the series, it's proven that despite being slightly dense, he never went full donkan that it makes his personality more believable. Despite also being quite overpowered to some extent, Willem has a worn-out bodies that limits him for being a Gary Stu and throughout the series, we can see on how his inner conflicts due to his undying fighting spirit in order to be a hero that fight against the beasts to protect the people. Or is it what it means to be a hero? Can it also mean about something else which is more trivial to be protected? Willem can be distinguished from your typical hero by his limitations in conjunction on the redefinition of what does it meant to be a hero.\\n\\n\r\nThe heroine, Chtholly Nota Seniorious, is a mysterious 15 year old Leprechaun whom little is known about her past until the series went further. Leprechauns are the continents trump card in their battle against the beasts, and they are trained in order to have no fear of death. However, due to their appearance that resembles those of humans, whom are thought to be the one responsible for the world destruction, they are being shunned by the common society and regarded as being \"featureless\". At the first few minutes of the anime, Willem saved Chtholly from slipping and being the object of hate by the mass, and then took her stroll together with him. After they lives together and he taught many thing Chtholly never feel before due to her lifestyle, she began to question whether all the \"fighting with bravery\" mindset which had been planted on her since her birth was really the way of living on its truest. Her quirks really shown in a detailed manner, more than even the protagonist, which makes the watcher attached to her all along to her, for a very nice reasons.\\n\\n\r\nTo be frank, the romantic relationship between the two main characters sprouts too fast. But once it sprouts, it develops in an excellent pace. The bashful nature of both parties, yet knowing that they do love each other can never fails to made me smile. Unlike many other romance I have experienced, SukaSuka gives both views towards the other, which is something important in order to make a good romance since I believe that romance is a double sided relationship and portrayal of just a single party will make the other party an object instead. SukaSuka knew this well and avoided it.\\n\\n\r\nPortrayal of humans on SukaSuka are very evil. It's believable on how the settings took place most likely on the far future where humans might got overboard with their greediness and exploitation. It serves as a contemplation for the watchers on what have we become so far, did we have turned to be nice to the mother earth or is it the opposite? Does all experiments make the world a better place? Homo homini lupus, and this actually fits really well after you learn some truth regarding the plot point. Of course, like other works which has living biological weapon plot point, it also portray on how it's unethical on the usage of it or I can say that war in general is a futility.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike most popular post-apocalyptic anime nowadays, the focus of SukaSuka isn't the action, but rather the family themed character drama instead, but it still realized that the characters are in a life and death situations without abusing many fight scenes. Balancing such a lighthearted tone with a darker one is hard, but it still manages to can have a mostly light tone without forgetting the situation they're in. More good news, this tone blends well with the core theme of he show.SukaSuka have an ok worldbuilding, in which starts out delivering few expositions towards the world they lived in, and manages to give a slow but steady and sufficient amount of it as the series progress. A lot of information still being missing however, but I can comprehend that since it only adapts about half of the Light Novel. It explained why the people took refuge on the sky island, how it was made, about the war against the beast in depth, and so on that the essential information make the watchers can follow the story easily. Sometimes, bombing the watchers with a lot of expositions is obnoxious, especially if done by monologues but none of them happens in SukaSuka and it feels natural. One other thing worth mention is that SukaSuka is feminist friendly, as how the Leprechauns done most of the fights while Willem being a nurturing figure for the Leprechauns. It also added by the fact Scarborough Fair was sung by a female singer, but use the masculine lyrics that modifies female third person into the male ones. Scarborough Fair also blends perfectly with the medieval esque settings of the Sky Island, to add up for the overall quality.\\n\\n\r\nDespite my praise, SukaSuka have a considerable amount of flaws too. The theme presentation is kind of childish for the earlier episodes and the type of comedy doesn't fit with the show settings, as most of them are more befitting to a school harem anime. The visuals is quite nice but can be improved in a lot of ways, especially the characters expressions most of the time. Lastly, due to the amount of focus to the main character, almost all of the side characters fell flat out one-dimensional which is barely memorable, although those who like characters with said personality might remember them very well. Aware with all these flaws, I still think that the pros really outweighs the cons.\\n\\n\r\nSukaSuka gets better over time and the ending made me overflowed with feels towards it. The slow motion scene power was also backed up with the song which have been tuned at the first episode. How the ambience, melody, and the lyrics can't fit any better to the situation they're on the ending is outstandingly scary. Trust me, even when the buildup from the prior episodes don't affect you that much, the ending is still golden, despite its predictability. The execution of cinematography went all out on the ending, especially that scene which is more than a satisfactory for me that usually don't feel for a melodrama. If such scene isn't emotionally engaging at the slightest, then I don't think emotionally engaging anime moments existed.\\n\\n\r\nSukaSuka is one of the best beverages for the pacifist soul like me, and it has become one of my most enjoyable anime so far, if not the most. It also restored my faith to seasonal anime and become my medicine for generic action anime nowadays. The accurate depiction and thought provoking message about what does it take to be a human, heroism for the adults, family, valuing the present over the past or a vague future, living one's own life to its fullest, and the delicate wrappings of all these mature themes into such story is what enchant me to this Light Novel adaptation. SukaSuka might not the savior the community deserves, but SukaSuka is the savior that the community needs.",

            "content": "I feel like that I can't give another 10 to an emotional anime now that I have seen this...\r\nSukasuka is the one anime that will linger in my heart for quite some time. It is also first drama/romance anime that made me want to re-watch. It's also a hard anime to describe with words; it's really an emotional roller coaster. But if I were to describe Sukasuka in terms of more popular anime, I'd describe it as what \"Violet Evergarden Should Have been\", or Anohana, or Clannad or whatever.\r\nThink of Sukasuka as an emotional movie that gets your heart into wrecks because it is comparableto, well actually better than a lot of emotional movies. It has perfect soundtracks played at the right time, with happy and sad themes to add more to the story. The soundwork for SukaSuka is one of the best, rivaling Violet Evergarden. The sounds add another dimension on this such already great anime.\\n\\n\r\nDespite it's long title (which made it subject to laughs of being an anime based off LN, which are quite full with mediocre stories), sukasuka has one of the best stories I have seen in anime so far. Well stories aside, it's phenomenal in ... just all departments.\\n\\n\r\nThe world building in Sukasuka is ONE OF THE BEST. I won't talk much about the story here, but from the first episode where Willem and Chtholly met, I could tell that there were much to be explored in this world with floating islands and fairies. Some LN readers have complained that this anime is not full adaptation of the 5 novels, but the anime by itself completes Chtholly's story (and in a good fashion) too. There is a beginning, the roller coaster then the resolution. It's not like many other LN adaptation where it is cut off in the middle.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason I gave a 9 on the enjoyment is because the empty sensation that comes as a result of finishing this anime. It's been several weeks since I finished this series, but I still yearn to find another series like this. A lot of anime looks pretty shit now that I have seen this. I am really sad that this anime doesn't get the attention it deserves. The production and the story is top-tier, levels ahead of majority of popular anime.\\n\\n\r\nTL; DR: A Masterpiece (coming from a guy with really low MAL avg ratings)\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "SukaSuka is set in a post-apocalyptic future where Wilhelm, the last surviving human, is brought out of an icy sleep after centuries when his kind was wiped out by supernatural beings called Beasts and he becomes a paternal figure to a number of young girls who are leprechauns, beings capable of wielding powerful magical swords that can slay the Beasts at the cost of the wielder's life force and personality for each time they fight.\r\nIn terms of plotting, the series is a mixed bag having its high and low points. Starting with the positive end, the series does a solid job with focusing on thecharacters of Wilheim and Ctholly, one of the leprechaun girls he develops a bond throughout the course of the series. Both have their unique struggles they are dealing with throughout the series with Wilheim adjusting to the new world he is unexpectedly part of and Ctholly being different from other leprechauns in that she fears facing death while others of her kind are fearless in facing it due to being created as such. It also takes time to explore elements of the world of its series where mythical creatures have come to take humanity's place in existing after its extinction and have survived by living on floating islands to avoid many of the Beasts that have taken control over the ground. The second half of the series also progressively gets better as Wilheim and Ctholly's bond develops and tragedy starts to strike with Ctholly slowly falling victim to the deterioration of her body from use of her sword.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, SukaSuka does suffer a good deal with its first half and dealing with its other characters. The first half of the series falls into the usual bad habit of a number of anime with attempting to poorly implement comedy during serious situations in an attempt to balance out its more somber mood. In addition, the series did get inconsistent with its plotting direction at points in its first half where the show shifted focus away from Ctholly's situation and attempted to focus on side plots involving the other leprechauns. While focus on the side characters may have been worthwhile if this were a longer series, this isn't the case with SukaSuka and said side plots derail focus on its main plot involving Ctholly and Wilheim's characters. Also not helping matters is that beyond Ctholly and Wilhelm, the majority of other characters don't get much in the way of fleshing out as they are reduced to simple archetypes and seemingly only exist to contrast the characters or advance the show's plot into a certain direction.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I suppose my reception to SukaSuka is mixed. While having a decent amount of world building and a strong second half focusing on the bond between our two major characters, the series still suffered from a first half that struggled to find a solid direction for its plot, needless implementation of humor, and the majority of its cast being underdeveloped compared to Wilhelm and Ctholly. It is an okay fantasy-based drama with what it offers up, but far from being the best anime I have come across this year thus far.",

At the start, I will write, when I read the LN, it hurts me, but I was not able to stop because the characters and story were really good. Anime is a really good adaptation for this LN.\r\nStory 9/10\r\nFrom episode 1 you can guess in what direction this anime will be going. This is not your typical fighting or happily ever after anime. This anime focus more on way of thinking. How beastman people see this little girls as weapons andthey don\u00b4t care if they lose their life or not. How our MC sees this little girls different, because of his past and his feelings or how Nygglatho have a different point of view on the whole situation. It is a story about a promise, fear, desire to love and to be loved. \\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\\n\r\nWell, there are some truly amazing scenes. But sometimes you see that there was probably not enough of budget.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI guess that everyone who watch this anime understand. Music is used simply perfect and it fits really well. For example, Scarborough Fair version was outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9/10\\n\\n\r\nWillem, Kutori, Nygglatho, girls, I think it is really hard to don\u00b4t like them. They offer you a different point of view on the whole situation. Also Kutori x Willem interaction is in my opinion really nicely done. Also, Willem x girls\u00b4 interaction or Willem x Ren interaction is truly cute.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I really enjoy the story. Don\u00b4t expect a fighting anime or some fan-service. This anime is simply focused on feelings. Love, fear, tragedy and more, you will find them all.",

            "content": "Did you ever get that feel of \"this could be great if\" while reading or watching something? This feel is exactly what this anime is about. A story with huge potential, but undermined. Undermined by the author's lack of proper writing skills. By conventions of a degenerated form of writing. And by a not so good adaptation.\r\nThis show can pass by as your average light novel adaptation with ease. Hella long title you won't remember no matter what. A cast of characters with names difficult to read or memorize. Male MC that shoves up people's ass his set of morals once in a while. MC'slove interest that goes melodramatic and cry several times. Yet you can find here the tragedy of a man. A man that lost everything, and ends up in some state of suspended animation until he is awaken many years later in a \"foreign\" world (Captain America, huh?). The cute heroine is actually a weapon of mass destruction that can die any time for the sake of the world. High stakes for the love interests and the risk of emotional loss could make this a great love story, right?\\n\\n\r\nProblem is, the show couldn't decide whenever it wanted to be a dull light novel adaptation or a good story. This leaded to a confusing presentation and lack of self-awareness. Say, they present you with a little depth of Willem's character. It is reedeming and set him as a \"not your typical LN male MC at all\". And, show a few seconds later one of the most cringe-inducing reactions that a plain tsundere girl can have. Breakdowns like this are destructive to suspension of disbelief.\\n\\n\r\nBut in the long run, the show saves itself from the mediocrity valley. Remember the love story? What blooms here is the most organic romance I have seen in anime, at least in a while. Never two people falling in love with each other felt so natural. Chtholly (I swear I didn't look up the character list) slowly evolves into a housewife in hopes to become a better person for Willem. Willem in turn tries to overcome his own fears of another loss so he can give Chtholly the love she deserves. Both of them reach the stage of mutual love step by step. It's simple, but it works.\\n\\n\r\nThe show goes up and down since episode one, between LN's conventions and good writing. There's a immersive post-apocalyptic setting. A well-tied set of emotional stakes, great OST and some gorgeous visuals. But there are one-sided characters, with single tropes defining them. Also a typical LN setup, and some crappy CGI.\\n\\n\r\nAs bad as this series might sound, it's good enough. At least, the LN medium isn't completely doomed. The guy who wrote this is talented, but needs to polish his skills and broaden his writing experience, which seems narrow yet.\\n\\n\r\n\"How do you fall in love at the end of the world?\" - This alone would be a better name, although still long. Keep your titles short and easy to read they say. The name \"SukaSuka\" means nothing to me. So how I'm supposed to call for this show?",

            "content": "(Please note, there are many spoilers in this review)\r\nI typed up probably seven different openers for this review before realizing that nothing I say can possibly prepare you for what's to come. This introduction, or lack thereof, actually goes on to mimic the underlying themes of this series in more ways than one. WorldEnd (Which also goes by the incredibly long title of 'What Are You Doing At The End Of The World? Are You Busy? Will You Save Us?') is more than just the hyperdramatic adaptation of a light novel going by the same name, it's a story about never being prepared; it's astory about how everything in life comes and goes far too quickly for us to comprehend. But, at the same time, so much of the beauty in life can only be leeched from it due to its apparent absence in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nWorldEnd is a series that can, by no means, be nailed down to one general concept. The scope of its meaning is as vast as the world it takes place in -- a world in which humanity has all but vanished. The remaining life forms have taken to the skies, building civilizations upon floating islands and relying on creatures known as 'Leprechauns' to fight in a never-ending war. The leprechauns in WorldEnd, however, are not your typical Irish, fun-loving drunkards. Instead, they are girls born from children who died before having anything to live for, and the main leprechaun who we follow throughout WorldEnd goes by the name Ctholly Nota Seniorious.\\n\\n\r\nCtholly initially comes off as a sort of aloof, curious girl, struggling to fit in with a world full of disfeatured humanoids. The irony in this, however, is that those without extreme physical deformities (Or those who appear human) are actually the ones known as the 'disfeatured' in WorldEnd. Partway through the pilot, we are also introduced to the second protagonist, Willem Kmetsch, as he encounters Ctholly for the first time. After showing her around the island for a bit, Ctholly departs and Willem is left on his own. Having recently fallen on hard times, he reluctantly takes on a job as the caretaker for a nearby military facility. Of course, he doesn't really understand what he's getting himself into until he shows up and it's less of a warehouse and more of an orphanage full of young girls. And while this seems like a pain to him at first, his attitude takes a dramatic shift when he realizes that these girls are the only weapons civilization has left.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the first sign of tragedy out of many. Yes, the idea of young girls being used as weapons is rather unfortunate and incredibly sad. But throughout the next eleven episodes, the series begins to steamroll down a path in which we grow attached to every single one of them only to have those relationships severed and beaten by the end of the series. The most dramatic of all of these relationships, however, is the budding romance that slowly begins to flourish between Ctholly and Willem.\\n\\n\r\nWithout giving away everything, something happens to Ctholly that begins to drain her sanity. Slowly but surely, her memories begin to fade and her hair begins to change colors, turning into a violent shade of red instead of her normal, subtle blue. The shift in hair colors is not just a shift in appearance, however. This physical change mimics the drastic mental change that is occurring within her at the same time. Ctholly is bombarded with confusing images and the voice of tortured young girl, speaking in eerie metaphors. And while none of what this voice is saying makes sense to us, the sheer manner in which they are said is enough to signify the deterioration of her psyche. The worst part of this is that Ctholly knows what's happening to her.\\n\\n\r\nDay after day, Ctholly remembers less of herself and clings tightly to the one thing she knows for sure -- that she's in love. She tosses aside her slightly-tsun outlook from earlier in the series and simply adopts the fact that she loves Willem, making it known to him every chance she gets. And while he spends a decent amount of time avoiding the subject, it's clear that Willem feels the same way. The steamrolling tragedy that we all know is coming screeches to a halt and, for just the slightest moment, everything is perfect. \\n\\n\r\nBut then it's not.\\n\\n\r\nWillem takes Ctholly to a nearby military ship after catching wind of a weapon that could help her fading consciousness. When tuning one of the other leprechauns weapons, however, he discovers something that stays with him for the rest of the series. The monsters that these girls have been fighting have actually been humans the entire time. And while exactly how that happened remains open to interpretation for us viewers, it's crystal clear to Willem. His vision and outlook become distorted and he begins to lose his grip on reality in a way both incredibly similar and incredibly different to Ctholly. \\n\\n\r\nThe final episode is like lighting -- it comes and it goes quicker than we're able to comprehend. Ctholly loses her grip on reality as battle breaks loose and slips into a coma. Willem, incapable of coping with the thought that this might be the end for her, erupts into a hate-fueled rage, slaughtering any monster he comes across as the rest of the army and several of the other leprechauns fight for their lives. One of the girls, Nephren, has a particularly harsh time with this, ultimately sacrificing herself so that a few others might live. Just as she collapses, however, Willem finds her. And, in a last-stitch effort so save something, he dives after her as she falls off of the airship.\\n\\n\r\nThe following five minutes go on to create one of the most heartbreaking and tear-inducing scenes I have ever seen. Ctholly manages to persuade the girl inhabiting her mind to let her come back to reality one last time -- all so she could save Willem. Then, as she stands surrounded by corpses on the edge of the airship, her last strands of blue hair change to red and she dives. Freefalling thousands of feet in the air, Scarborough Fair and the endless barrage of strange, psychological metaphors from Elq assault our ears and our hearts as we watch this girl we've fallen in love with trade away her sanity for someone else's happiness. A dual-monologue between Willem and Ctholly breaks out as she reappears out of thin air and desperately attacks the monsters surrounding him. As the monologue loses steam, Ctholly does as well. Her attacks slow as she is impaled by countless tendrils and lifted high up into the same sky she descended from just minutes ago.\\n\\n\r\nThe battle comes to a close and everything we have grown to love over the past three months is stripped from us quicker than it was given. The few scenes that follow only make it harder.\\n\\n\r\nIn Summary:\\n\r\nWhat an incredibly heartfelt and gorgeous series this was. The amount of love put into this project is palpable on all accounts and, thanks to one of the most well-written female characters in years, the mark that WorldEnd leaves will be a lasting one. The harmonious blend of intimate Celtic music meshed with tragic fight scenes and flawless acting creates something much more immersive than you would normally find in any visual medium. For a few seconds, it even feels like we're there. Something that important is hard to put into words, but if I had to limit my description of this series to one, it would be 'beautiful'. Please, set aside a night and watch this all in one go. You won't possibly regret it.",

I will say this though, SukaSuka isn\u2019t your typical fantasy thriller that just jumps right into the action. In fact, it\u2019s far more than that as this series attemptsto craft a tearjerking fantasy drama to reach expectations.\\n\\n\r\nI have to admit, watching SukaSuka took me some time to accept the story. The first few episodes has an atmospheric feel with its world setting, characters, and plot. We meet Willem, the male protagonist who happens to be the last human in a post-apocalyptic world. The show makes it clear that humans are extinct as the anime opens up with a battle scene involving them and the Beasts. Flash forward into the present timeline and we see how the world has changed since then. Now there are floating islands that feel so isolated from each other despite being populated with otherworldly species. One of the most prominent of these species are the Leprechauns, characters who can wield ancient Dug weapons that can destroy Beasts. In the meantime, Willem meets Chtholly, a leprechaun with a mysterious past. The show establishes Willem as a friend, father figure, and comrade for the Leprechauns.\\n\\n\r\nRight off the bat, I can say that SukaSuka\u2019s characters are quite mysterious. Chtholly has a peculiar past that is explored throughout the show. Willem also has a past that I can say it\u2019s too pleasant to remember. Then, there are the Leprechauns. The show creates an eerie feel as it blends them with child innocence and unsettling fear. It\u2019s through revelations that Willem realizes what they really are and their roles in this series. Now, the more I got curious about the show, the more I wonder how the story plans to develop Willem and Chtholly\u2019s relationship. Thankfully, this series doesn\u2019t neglect their presence together and as each episode progresses, we learn more about the both of them. Character chemistry between Willem and Chtholly is also what I describe as charming that develops from friendship to romance. Willem also serves as a father figure for the younger Leprechauns. And in turn, the Leprechauns seems to grow really fond of him. This also brings a different side of the show as Willem realizes that the Leprechauns has a lack of fear. Because of this, the show makes it clear that Willem wants to avert any tragedy that can bestow on them. This goes to show how much Willem cares about the Leprechauns. It may also be possible that Willem doesn\u2019t want history to repeat itself because of the way humans were wiped out. Regardless of how others treat him, he hopes to be a light of hope in this post-apocalyptic world.\\n\\n\r\nAs a show with many species, you\u2019ll often see characters that are far from ordinary. Besides Leprechauns, there are also trolls, goblins, and many other type of characters with animal traits. This also brings a racial issue into the show. It puts Willem into a compromising position at times as certain races does not like his presence in their world. (for their own personal reasons) However, what I do find interesting about this series is Willem\u2019s main role. Does he play the role of a hero or someone that just wants to avoid tragedy again? It\u2019s hard to judge entirely based on the characterization alone so in retrospect, the show leaves it more open ended for viewers to decide. \\n\\n\r\nDespite my initial impression of SukaSuka, I still find that the show suffers from several problems that holds itself back. First, the show really doesn\u2019t avoid generic pitfalls you see in typical light novel adaptations. While the show has minimal fan service, it still has the cringe moments between Willem and various female characters. One particular trope (played out more as a joke) are the massages that attempts to make scenes sound much more lascivious than it appears to be. Not to mention, SukaSuka\u2019s comedy feels really dry at times. It hardly make me laugh and although I realize the show isn\u2019t built for that, it doesn\u2019t even manage to ever draw a chuckle from me. Furthermore, I can\u2019t really say the character relationship building outside of Willem/Chtholly to be worth mentioning. Oh and in terms of adaptation standards, the show does add some original content in attempt to make the story flow better. Does it really work out? That\u2019s for me to know and you to find out.\\n\\n\r\nTaking a look at the animation, I have to admit that SukaSuka captured the atmospheric setting right along with its world fiction. Essentially, the atmospheric setting brings a spiritual feel. The character designs also has variety with the wide range of different hair styles and colors; with a credible reason too beyond just being decorative especially for the Leprechauns. The action is captivating and feels magical with getting its point across. While the series doesn\u2019t have graphic violence, it does contain blood to show the dreadful feel of its story. The Beasts are also designed with a malevolent nature and some of them reminds me of Lovecraftian horror fiction. Character expressions is realistic and very human like with most of its characters.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is distinguishable with a combination of being melancholic, haunting, and cheerful. As I had expected, the theme songs are very moody with its choreography. The character voicing acting also connects well with their personalities in particular with Willem, Chtholly, and Grick. As most of the Leprechauns are quite young, stepping into the shoes of these characters is not easy. However, I am proud to say that the show captured their roles pretty damn well and make you connected to them.\\n\\n\r\nThe tenderness of this show is what attracted me to watching this. I have to admit, SukaSuka has a sublime-like creativity with its world setting and story. I wasn\u2019t too invested into the characters at first though over time, Willem and Chtholly\u2019s relationship started to really grown to me. Still, like most light novel adaptations these days, SukaSuka falls into the trap of generic tropes. Furthermore, I don\u2019t think this series is recommendable for anyone especially those that have less tolerance towards moody shows. I\u2019d still give it a try though. It\u2019s not a masterpiece but for a title that\u2019s longer than 3 sentences, it does earn more attention than that.\\n",

            "content": "This show is hard to talk about, because it's a sad story.  It's the story of how a promising show can be undermined by an unnecessary adherence to convention.  Oh, you thought I was talking about the plot of the show itself?\r\nAllow me to put this into perspective.  The Japanese light novel has a fair bit of history now, but allow me to be glib and say that they're a modern sort of pulp fiction.  Pulp fiction was a type of media engineered for popular entertainment.  It was printed in periodicals on cheap paper (the pulp in pulp fiction).If you were to simplify all fiction into either, \"genre fiction,\" or \"serious literature,\" pulp fiction was all the way on the genre end of the scale.  The medium gave rise to some storytelling trends of its own, such as the two-fisted tale.  Much of the same can be said about the modern Japanese light novel.\\n\\n\r\nThis show wears its light novel trappings on its sleeve.  This is apparent from the title alone.  It's entirely too long to remember, much less recite, inviting people to invent some marketing-friendly fan nickname.  It's set in another world.  There is exactly one guy in the main cast.  There are some vaguely-defined superpowers involved.  The main girl has long hair, at least past the mid-point of the back.  There are probably many more examples I could have listed here.\\n\\n\r\nVery little of this is obvious from the start of the show.  The first episode was so enjoyable and well-crafted that I paid these sorts of things no mind.  In retrospect, there were a few fears which had gathered, though I hadn't put words to them yet.  A good show draws you into its world, and lacks annoying distractions.  You aren't likely to think about this sort of thing during a good show.  However, the rest of the show wasn't up to the standard that first episode had set.  By the end of the fourth episode, I had put words to the fears, and found justification for them.\\n\\n\r\nThe first concerns the plot.  This is one thing which isn't necessarily light-novel-ish, and seems to be more like one of Key/Visual Arts' so-called \"utsuge,\" or \"crying games.\"  I disliked these sorts of stories for being emotionally manipulative.  They would unabashedly use cheap tricks to get you to feel sad.  Thus, the fear, \"Will they have these girls dying off one by one for cheap tears?\"  Now, a little tragedy isn't a bad thing.  However, the end of episode four was troubling.  Right after stirring the depths of main guy's trauma, main girl did a stupid anime rom-com thing and broke the tension.  Thus, at this point, I don't trust this show to handle tragedy appropriately.\\n\\n\r\nThat isn't even the only problem I have with the plot.  Main guy's backstory is presented a bit out of order such that it induces a bit of a plot hole.  It made it clear that he was there to see the destruction of the surface world, yet also that this occurred about 200 years ago, long enough that his native language has become a dead language.  How this is possible wasn't made clear until later.  Even though we can accept the explanation via willing suspension of disbelief, since it's arguably necessary for the story to exist, there remains the question of why it was presented in this haphazard way.\\n\\n\r\nThe setting has a bit of a similar issue, though it's more of a mixed bag.  The airborne cities are beautiful, and I'm happy to set aside questions of how such things exist to admire them.  The fact that they're filled with the so-called, \"featured,\" humans with animal traits, or maybe sentient human-like animals, is also interesting.  This actually creates a bit of a problem, since the story only deals with these things superficially.  I want to see more of the world outside the orphanage-prison, but the plot isn't really interested in these things.  The plot really only cares about the fairy-girls.  The \"featured\" seem to only exist to isolate them, and to not-so-subtly encourage the viewer to empathize with them.  You see, this is a harem show.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, it's a themed harem.  The theme?  Lolis.  Yes, inner cynic, the orphanage-prison really is a lolicon paradise.  It was a totally gratuitous fanservice shot, of one of the younger girls, that verified this for me.  The presentation is a bit misleading in this (Black Bullet was a lot more transparent).  It's even possible this wasn't the author's intent, but it's what we got anyway.  Main girl is supposedly 15, which should be outside the lolicon range, but she's drawn like the object of a hebephile's wet dream anyway.  In some other show, I might have written this off as her being the flat one, but it's hard to interpret her any other way in this context.  There is a full-grown woman around, but she's treated like a joke by the narrative and as a nuisance by the main guy.  It's normal for a harem show to feature a character, the \"harem nanny,\" whose purpose is to manage the harem; this is literally her job.  She is a walking TV tropes entry.\\n\\n\r\nSeveral of the other characters are easily dismissed in this way.  Nephren is the nigh-emotionless girl.  Ithea is the gadfly.  Chtholly, a.k.a. main girl, is the tsundere.  Up until the end of episode four, I had a better opinion of her.  After that, it's clear that being a tsundere is her defining character trait.  It would be easy to declare main guy, a.k.a. Willem, to be the typical slightly moody light novel protagonist.  For once, this seems to be a bit unfair.  His broodiness stems from understandable guilt and unresolved grief, and he doesn't seem to project the typical too-cool-to-care nonsense that generally goes with the archetype.  Whether he's as overpowered as the typical escapist protagonist remains to be seen, but the fact that he's been defeated at least once, and even shown as mostly helpless in the scope of the narrative, makes it hard to compare him to the likes of Tatsuya Shiba.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this show could have been something good.  This isn't mere speculation, as the first episode stands as testament to this potential.  It has aspects I like without reservation, such as the scenery porn and the soundtrack.  However, the medium of the source material, and the expectations associated with it, soiled it a bit.  There were too many annoying distractions to allow me to enjoy the good things.",

            "content": "SukaSuka is a post-apocalyptic fantasy anime that follows Wilhelm, a human that has been frozen for 500 years, who after being recovered finds out that humanity and the entire world has been decimated by some plant like beasts. He now lives with all the remaining races in some islands in the sky, and during one eventful day he conveniently meets a human looking girl and they spend the day with each other until it was time to depart home. After a few circumstances, mostly pertaining to his physical appearance, Wilhelm as tasked to take care of a certain place for the military which he accepts.When he gets there he is meet by a group of girls who live in an orphanage like building and it is revealed that they are fairies known as leprechauns who are the islands defence against the beast due to them being able to handle certain weapons that can fight against the beasts. \\n\\n\r\nThe first part of the series mostly focuses on wilhelm taking care of the girls along with Nygglatho a human looking women despite being a troll. There are a plethora of girls in the show, but most of them are young and get very little focus except one who serves more as an example for the way leprechauns are. The main girls are Chtholly, Nephren, and Ithea, but the story mostly focuses on Chyholly and Wilhelm and how they build a mutual relationship over the course of the show. The show also does some decent world building, or at least better than most fantasy anime. Many fantasy races live within close proximity to each other(  a common staple in most fantasy anime), but for this show it\u2019s not because they want to, but because they have to since the islands are the only safe places to be. Even then it doesn\u2019t hold will as there are some scenes of racial tensions between races especially against disfeatured due to how human looking they were. Some bits of a city's culture were explored due to how one race was influential to it. the orgin of the islands and leprechauns are looked into and how they came into being.the mechanics of the dug weapons are neat as well. However in the end it\u2019s at best decent since most of it is really skin deep due to the anime having to focus on the otherwise lackluster story. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is lackluster since the anime is overtly melodramatic throughout it\u2019s run time since it promises a tragedy at the end of its course and tries its best for the viewer to feel emotional in the end. The anime always tries to make sure of this with its focus on Chtholly, our tragic heroine of the show, as she has to undergo external internal mental struggles after her fight with the beasts. She was a decently written character, but it\u2019s a shame how most of it will be discarded in order for the show to make her death more tragic. Along with her on the ride is Wilhelm who is also a decently written character as the show goes through his past as a \u201cbrave\u201d, a group of generic heroes, and some of the things he\u2019s done that lead to the present despite being gone for 500 years. He has a easy going and collected attitude, but underneath that demeanor is someone with regrets and pain, and will do anything to make Chtholly and the other girls happy. However other than them not many other characters are that well fleshed out despite some of them having some importance to the story.\\n\\n\r\nProduction wise the show looks and sounds good. The art looks very standard as well as the character designs and setting. The animation was decent as well with mostly consistent quality throughout its run. Some notable parts for the art/animation are usually for the wings as well as Chtholly\u2019s mind scenes, but the downside would be how dull the beasts look. The sound for the show is good as well with many of the voice acting fitting thier roles. The Ost for the show is also good mostly to fit the tone of the scene, but sometimes it\u2019s allowed to be the only sound playing in order to set a certain atmosphere\\n\\n\r\nOverall there are alot of good things about this show when it comes to the production, and some of the ideas of the story. However the problem is what the story tries to focus on as well as how it tries to execute it. It\u2019s a show that tries to present something well meaning and emotional, but fails to deliver.",

It's about a forced romance between the adult male lead and a 15 year old main girl. It's masked as a father/daughter kind of relationship in the beginning, which only fuels my rage about it being turned into a romance that has the chemistry of drinking toothpaste with orange juice.\r\nWhat I assumed to be the core conflict of the series was the issue of using children as expendable weapons. In the end that didn't seem to be the case as the issue wassolved in less than an episode, with the main character going \"don't do it\" and that's pretty much it.\\n\\n\r\nThen there was the conflict of the main girl leaving for battle. It was obvious from the start that they wouldn't kill her off there but the fact that she was brought back not only within the very same episode as the death fake-out, but RIGHT AFTER the main character gets the news of her possible death. Their inability to hold the suspense for at least a single damned episode is cheap to say the very least.\\n\\n\r\nArt style is beautiful and the world-building had potential, all wasted in a story that is unable to focus on the aspects that would have truly been interesting to see develop further. All in all the anime is an unfocused mess that could have been great, had it not been for the whole forced romance plotline.",

            "content": "When a new anime season comes around; consumers of all tastes keep their eyes peeled for new fresh blood that can potentially have an impact on them and become a new favourite. As years have been going by it\u2019s been getting harder and harder to spot potentially good shows as generic titles embracing the mediums current tropes are flooding the seasonal charts and no signs suggest this will stop anytime soon. So when something comes around with a premise that highlights potential, it\u2019s understandable that people would get excited for it, especially if the source material has an existing fan base who are spreading aroundexhilaration for the adaptation. I am also one such consumer who looks out for potentially interesting shows that can stand out. I had my eyes peeled at an anime that I really thought could have been good. The production values were there, the premise was there, the potential was there. But as per normal with a lot of anime nowadays; the execution was not quite there. So this anime gets the honour of a review dedicated to how it missed the mark. And what is this special anime? Enter Sukasuka. A light novel adaptation that could have been good; except it wasn\u2019t.\\n\\n\r\nSukasuka had a nice set of ideas to become a good light novel adaptation. But the foundations weren\u2019t set right; the characters being the first problem. With a multitude of characters introduced in the first few episodes, the show should have explored them all a little more thoroughly to bring its themes to life. Furthermore, some side characters introduced in the latter half of the show lacked any authenticity and served only as plot devices for information on the plot without playing active roles as proper characters that can serve the themes and story.  The setting also had a lot of potential for some exploration on issues such as child soldiers, war, conspiracy and potentially other themes relating to the situation that the anime presented. There were plenty of instances where some side characters had potential to be explored to support the larger narrative and the setting, but the show opted to go for a more passive take on fantasy conflict by attempting to depict a romance between the two protagonists which isn\u2019t  necessarily a bad thing. It could have given it a unique edge against other anime in its genre that all rely on action as their main appeal to attract an audience, but it\u2019s unfortunate that the romance between the protagonists was poorly illustrated.\\n\\n\\n\r\n From the very first scene in the anime, the main male character Willem conveniently stumbles upon the main female character Chytolly and within an instant they go on a date together. From the beginning of the anime their relationship began on a forced note making it already feel unnatural as both characters fell for each other far too quickly and it could have benefitted the story more had the progression of their love felt natural and realistic. In effect, this makes the development between them not as engaging as it could have been and took away emotional value in later events. What also doesn\u2019t help the case is Chytolly\u2019s overabundance of emotional breakdowns which led to a lot of excessive melodrama that came off as unwarranted and annoying rather than genuine emotion that could also have made for some touching scenes if they weren\u2019t excessive and had the romance being good enough for me to care. The only sort of silver lining the romance between the protagonists has is some of the quirky dialogue the two share that managed to at least put a little smile on my face and it was quite endearing to see, but overall it\u2019s clear to see that the romance could have been portrayed with more care and its clumsiness is clearly visible.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIn contrast to the side characters, both of the protagonists as individual characters were fleshed out and developed. Each with their own dilemmas and this is the only worthy praise that I will give sukasuka excluding the audio-visuals. Chytolly\u2019s and Willem\u2019s traumas tied in with the central themes of the show and were also used as a way to reflect their progression to mutual love. As they got closer to conquering their ordeals, the more they fell in love with each other.  Also the subject matters of happiness, finding a place to call home, fighting for people you love and loosely family were all present as themes in sukasuka. They were all expanding upon and depicted thoroughly enough to make the backstories of the protagonists engaging. Its execution in this department was rather straight forward but satisfactory enough to get a pass mark. Everything the show aims to accomplish is brought together in a thematic sense and the relationship between the mains hits a surprisingly enjoyable and well produced emotional climax. But once again; its lack of care in the romance department hindered the emotional impact of the ending a little and it could have been far more emotionally gripping had the romance been depicted better. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe setting itself is what showed the most potential in sukasuka out of all its features. World-building is of utmost importance in a fantasy anime. In a story that doesn\u2019t take place in the world we know today, viewers have to be informed through the plot how the world works, how people in the world interact, the lore of the world and more. Sukasuka wasn\u2019t completely devoid of world building. On the surface level it had established an interesting world that set the stage for a tragic story.  The tragic backstory of the protagonist Willem was also tied in with the lore of the world to provide some much needed synergy between the characters and the setting, especially in a show that was lacking any sort of connection between the world and its characters.  What ultimately let the show down in this department was not using the full potential that its setting provided. It set the stage for some potential theme exploration on controversial topics that would have made for an interesting experience. The group of children Willem has been tasked to care for are all ancient weapons fielded off to face the enemy and misleads the audience into thinking this would be a very important plot point for the anime, but due to the direction the anime took this plot point was sidelined. As a result the show spent time on cheaply telling the audience on the dilemmas faced by the children rather than showing many consequences as a result of them being used as weapons of war.   \\n\\n\r\nBy far the best element of Sukasuka was the beautiful OST which was used to perfection. Placed in important and impactful scenes to heighten emotional impact and never overused to make the soundtrack feel redundant. Both the OP and ED were a pleasure to listen to and even work well as standalone listeners at any time. Alongside the audio the visuals also thrived. The show had a nice clear and neat colour palette that was exquisite to look at. The character designs were quite generic in appearance but were drawn neatly and attractive. Backgrounds were up to standard and the animation was quite good at times during some of the fight scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime certainly isn\u2019t an outright calamity. Compare it to most anime that air today and it will look like a gem to recent catastrophes like Eromanga-sensei. The ideas were all there. Under the hands of a more competent and experienced writer the show could have flourished into a fine fantasy anime. Yet it never set the foundations well enough for all of its ideas to wholly blossom which is a shame considering the show did have good intentions. Under the rubble it still has some merits to take away, and it\u2019s these positives that set this anime apart from the vast majority of light novel adaptations that are pumped out consistently every season. It is fully recommendable to hard core fantasy anime fans or just casual fans looking for an anime that offers some easily digestible entertainment. But it is instantly passible for experienced fans that are demanding more out of the medium than a simple romance story that isn\u2019t competent enough to do a satisfying job and would turn out rather average for those people. Sukasuka is not a bad show. But it simply has far too many shortcomings to be considered a success story.\\n",

            "content": "WorldEnd:What are doing at the end of the world?Are you busy?Will you save us? is quite a ride.  The title is long, but don't let it deter you from watching the anime.\r\nThe story is really emotional as it goes along.  It simply starts out with Willem being the last human alive after the rest dies out from a fight 500 years ago.  He was apparently frozen, but that isn't shown in the show.  He meets Chtholly while she is visiting Earth and they have a wonderful day together as he takes her to everything she wanted to see.  He endsup accepting a job as a technical officer for the military and he assigned to a floating island in the sky to care for a group of Leprechauns, whom are faeries who can use ancient Dug Weapons to drive away the Timere monsters that attack the lands.  The stuff that makes this show stand out is certainly the emotions and how the characters develop.  Even though he lost pretty much everything years ago, Willem quickly becomes accustomed to his new life as a care take for the children .  He rows along with the children every step of the way as he comes to realize the true nature of how they live their lives.  Chtholly takes a shrine to him pretty quickly as the two of them help each out in the roughest times and form a very touching relationship that demonstrates how much they are willing to do and sacrifice for each other.   The plot becomes a great story of tragic love as the two of them grow with each other, and other characters like Ithea and Nephren develop too.  Characters like Chtholly go through a lot of psychological trauma throughout the show and have to deal with part of themselves slipping away, in addition to dealing with other problems.  The ending is amazing and gives the show the tragic closure that you should expect to come. Overall, the story is very coherent and doesn't have all that many plot holes, but it does have a random episode in between that develops a character that's barely shown to be of any major importance later.  It easily gets a 8.5/10.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is just great too.  It's  not necessarily a mongatari type of stand out art, but it's still great art.  No matter if it's the memorable character designs, the backgrounds, weapons designs (you probably won't recognize the difference between each weapon, but they do look different for other ancient weapons in shows), the blending of hair colors, or even the different take on wing designs.  Faeries always have wings of some kind, but the ones here look almost mosaic like with their design.  In short, the art is great and stands out.  A 9/10 is deserved.  \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is amazing.  Every track complicated the scenes very nicely and they give off the feeling the show is meant to have.  The opening theme song is amazingly done.  The music is extremely pleasant to listen too and it sounds divine in a sense, and it's get across the tragedy and sadness that is everywhere throughout the anime and it has amazing visuals to go along with it.  This is technically an edit here for my my review since I wrote the review like 2 months or so ago from the date I'm changing my ending thoughts on the music.  10/10 for music.  At the time I wrote the review, I think I was just looking for a way to take off a minor amount of points because I didn't feel like this was a 9.4/10 show, but after thinking a little, I realized that swapping my sound and enjoyment scores  expresses my thoughts more accurately.  \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are great.  You really grow attached to them, especially Chtholly and Willem from a very point in the anime. Willem is basically the dad for all the Leprechauns he is in charge of, while Chtholly is more like their big sister.  Both of them have a lot more going on behind the scenes though and it starts to unravel as the plot goes forward.  Even Ithea and Nephren, and some of the younger faeries show personal growth along the way.  The story is filled with characters that just belong together.  Many of girls are examples of the cute girl on the outside, who has a lot of inner problems behind the scene and the way it's handled allows everyone else to grow alongside with the character experiencing trauma.  There are many characters that don't get much development, but they were younger side characters anyway.  Another 9/10 category.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I enjoyed this from start to finish and I never had a major feeling of dissatisfaction.  The ending cinches my enjoyment score since it is was so touching even though it was a tragic ending, but the show probably wouldn't be as good without the tragic closure.  My enjoyment earns a 9.5/10.  I recommend you watch this if you want to see some great character growth, great emotional and happy music, and all the good aspects of tragic love story all in one place.  I feel similarly about this show as I do about Angel Beats!, although, I enjoyed Angel Beats! slightly more but not enough to reflect it in my score since I'm not going to give .6-.9 as a score( no 9.6 for example) since it'll make my overalls core look weird.  I recommend you  watch Angel Beats! after this if you like Worldend of course, since both have similar vibes and quality.\\n\\n",

            "content": "First of, this kind of story is not for everyone, the audience of this story is more to the \"mature\" audience one. Second this story more to slice of love, this tell you about how life, how happiness mean. If you expect an action, or cliche, fanservice or moe, you go in wrong show.\r\nThis one story is one you called hidden gem\r\nWhy it called \"hidden gem\" because only some people can understand the meaning of this story that's why it beautiful\r\nI just want to copy one of the quote of this show main theme song\r\n\" I don't know the meaning of life, but I knowwhat's truly precious ~\"\\n\\n\r\nStory 10/10\\n\r\nThis is probably the best mixing of romance, slice of life,tragedy story that I ever watched in my entirely life. It's tell of slice of life, happiness and love. About a man who already lost everything then gained again then lost again. About a woman who finally find her happiness on the short moment of her life. About a man and a woman who love each other but no matter what happen, they wont' never be together. Even they lost their \"memories, even they lost all what they called themself and even on their \"empty shell\", their feelings will always stay in their heart.\\n\\n\r\nThe author/writer basically touch these two most important things on life :\\n\r\n1. Memories\\n\r\n2. A place where you called home/where you belong to\\n\\n\r\nAnd last thing, from episode 6 and onwards, this damn show trying to make you feel on every freaking episode\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10\\n\r\nArt kinda feel off on some episodes but kinda paid off with the atmosphere they build. Well it's not like the anime from godlike studio, so it understandable. It still very good and still got the feeling\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nThe music is making the anime more dramatic and tragic. The opening, ending and insert all dedicated for the main girl of the show. All the lyrics tell her feelings that she want to convey and story of how her struggle on her life, it describe her feelings and her story very well. Even the music is so sad and tragic. What's wrong with this show seriously?\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\r\nBecause this show is more to slice of life, the character development is expected to be strong on this kind of show. Yeah you will be see that, and it's too strong and sad the same time, every character have different perspective. The main character interaction is pure too. The main girl especially, it really hurt my heart where they can still and enjoy their life to the fullest on those cruel fate and become the \"happiest girl in the world\".\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nThough this kind of show is not suitable if you want some happy or cheering you mood after daily life of work/school, but I still enjoying the ride. This is one hell of emotion rides from start to end. If you love to read or have some hobby to read, try to see the LN, it have beautiful story, this kind of emotion ride is kinda rare to find on today era, so if you like this kind of genre too make sure to see it :)\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\r\nI'm glad I live long enough to see this hidden gem/rare show. Their tales, story, sorrow, tragedy and adventure will always in my heart :)\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Shuumatsu Nani Shitemasu ka? Isogashii desu ka? Sukutte Moratte Ii desu ka? otherwise known as SukaSuka\r\nSo let me begin by saying that I have completely put this anime on hold after watching the first episode of it around the time it came out in April/May.\r\nReasons to that was the first episode was kinda not that interesting to me. About a guy with a mysterious past takes a job to look after a bunch of lolis (wow amazing right?). \r\nNah what I mean is that, there were too many anime at the time coming out that were highly recommended that I simply couldn't care much ofSukaSuka after that, however 7 months later I continued SukaSuka and I can honestly say that I am so on another level glad that I did (literally feels bad not giving it a go the first time). Well to my surprise SukaSuka was so flipping amazing!. If it wasn't for the opening scenes of the first episode which made me more than enough curious to come back to it, then this anime would have been long gone from me. \\n\\n\r\nFrom there were do I begin? The music? geez the music was absolutely breathtaking, which ended up hitting me so hard towards the end of the series. You get this truly wonderful love story that inspires and builds throughout the anime, culminating till the very end which is executed in such a way that may seem extremely desolating at the end but gives the viewer so much more to imagine and take in (FEELS). All carried beautifully by an truly stunning soundtrack that elevates this anime to another level. That is thanks to Scarborough Fair performed by Tamaru Yamada (Hits so hard on the emotions I tell you).\\n\\n\r\nThe setting is a beautiful enigmatic world of numerous floating islands that are each home to small towns and are inhabited by animal humanoid-like people, to the dreaded surface that is filled with beasts being the reason why the races had to take it to the sky. The story behind this lies with what the humans had done centuries ago which in turn saw the demise of their race. There is no doubt a substantial amount of mystery throughout this anime and one watching would definitely consider that maybe they had missed a season or two before this, which is completely understandable. Yet this storytelling in this sense where the viewer is suddenly flug into the world is moderately rare. I am tired of anime series blatantly explaining the entire world in the first few episodes like an overly hyped New York times bestseller novel list of teen fantasy/sci-fi getting a Hollywood movie adaptation. This being a light novel the original creator had his hands in the adaption (Akira Kareno) so I fully trust that the 12 episodes is what was originally intended and hopefully a second season of this anime is on the horizon (please!).\\n\\n\r\nLittle things I really liked was that Willem was not portrayed throughout the show as a badass overpower warrior, he had more meaningful ways in protecting his love ones. The fact that this MC doesn't take centre stage is very refreshing. The world and lore isn't forced on you like most anime, I like the fact that throughout it is talked upon here and there leaving more mystery for us to piece things together about the world. There is this equilibrium of the cute funny side of Willem and the girls, to the more seriousness side of the state of the world which you can see during the time Willem spends with the girls and the battles the girls face respectively. The love story is slightly forced but in an understandable way to Chtholly\u2019s character being a young girl at that age where she is able to think for herself, especially after meeting someone (Willem) who she thought she will never see again. I mean there are so many other things that gets to me about this anime, that makes me want to come back to, especially the music.\\n\\n\r\nI can therefore say that SukaSuka has lowkey stolen my heart, has also made me reignite my love for anime. You know those endings that leaves you so empty as fuck BUT make you wish and wonder, that throws you in a room with your own interpretations and thoughts of what has happened and what will yet to come. Damn this anime made me laugh and most importantly cry so damn hard, that no anime has done for me to be completely honest.\\n\\n\r\nThis is my first review and i am completely new to MAL, because of this anime I just had to make an account.\\n",

            "content": "World End (aka SukaSuka) is not a bad show but it is a very unbalanced one.  It has it's good moments in front and back ends, but crammed in the middle is a lot of forgettable plot and characters.  Outside of the the leads, Wilhelm and Ctholly, I struggled to really even recall the names of the other characters.  While there are some interesting moments with the side characters, most notably Ithea, I mostly remember the characters by either their stereotypical trope and/or hair color.\r\nThe world the show has created is really fascinating and has a lot of potential.  It alsohas some great artwork and character designs.  But all that is wasted.  There are several episodes that are very much almost entirely filler and in a short 12 episode show, there is not much time to tell the narrative.  A lot of the fascinating parts of the story too, Wilhelm's and Ctholly's pasts are only very casually explored.  \\n\\n\r\nI understand that is that this show is ostensibly a romance set in a fantasy environment but I cannot for the life of me even recall why they have feelings for one another short of Wilhelm's almost pathological need to save someone and Ctholly for the first time seeing that there may be a reason to fear death because she wants to has things she wants to cherish.  Oh and then there is the awkward, completely-out-of-place orgasm scene.\\n\\n\r\nThe strength's of this show really is it's artwork and if you want to see some great visuals, this is a good one.  It also has a pretty good, albeit unresolved ending that finally delivers on some of the action that's teased in the beginning of the show and surprisingly neglected for the majority of the run.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the show is decent, but is ultimately very forgettable.  Having just finished the show during its original run, I am struggling to remember much of what occurred in the show.  If you're looking for a better told story with romance and fantasy elements, I'd recommend Re: Zero or Snow White with the Red Hair over this show.",

            "content": "The setup of this is the cutesy/anime version of Kazuo Ishiguro's book/movie \"Never Let Me Go\". Right from the start we have their moral dilemma; a few young people's deaths are perpetually necessary to protect the lives of the many. I don't know why this isn't mentioned more in the synopsis, it might have bagged a bigger adult viewership when you can only really see some cutesy pics and very limited info. I am enjoying it for this so far but it is a very large subjective matter to deal with. I hope they handle it carefully. It could easily degenerate into a \"save themand everything will be okay\" scenario which would make the original dilemma invalid.\\n\\n\r\nThe main trouble with the show is the motivation of the characters; their actions often don't make sense. There can often be no reason for their actions other than what the story needs to happen. Or, scenarios that seem important are ignored the whole epsiode. These things happen especially in episode 5.",

            "content": "I just love the synonym name of the anime: Suka-Suka\r\nIn my country, Suka-suka means like. It is a Bahasa Melayu language and a mother tongue for our citiziens. Google search it to know more.\r\nAt First, I don\u2019t plan to watch it, however the curiosity and the interest to watch this sparks in. Hence I decided to binge watch it for the first 4 episodes.\r\nAnd For that reason, I \u201csuka suka\u201d it, even though their title is quite long. \r\nThe pace of the plot is slow but is understandable, because to me it doesn\u2019t look like they rush the story, this is just based on myopinion since I didn\u2019t read their light novels. I love the plot of this anime where the setting takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where humanity has long gone extinct with only one sole human survivor remaining and has gone to slumber icy sleep for 500 years, and woke up to a world where furry creatures, fairies, goblins and lizards and etc. exists.  He adopts the post-apocalyptic life very well, though not the first few days when he woke up.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, the first moments of the first episode show the foreshadowing of what is going to happen in the final few episodes that will be aired soon, pretty early indication there. Another addition, is the comedy skits and moe moments added in the anime so that it doesn\u2019t make it look dark and gloomy series, just like 3 gatsu, the good thing is they don\u2019t put too much moe otherwise.\\n\\n\r\nThere is also romance setting in it, as Chtholly has romantic interest on Willem, I ship those two so bad till it sink. There were those moments when they show Chtholly and Willem scene, they\u2019re really cute together, even in the first episode. I second this.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation is amazing, artwork, character designs, background set up. I fancy this design, kudos to the drawing staffs who made the output of the anime pretty amazing. Studio Satelight is the studio in charge of this anime, and it already made few anime that I previously watched, one of it is Haruhi Suzumiya\u2019s spin off which is based more on Nagato Yuki. Very decent studio, hopefully they wont fuck this anime up.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP song and ED song are music to my ears, while the VA Selection are quite decent too, Willem voice actor is one of the highlights, with him still in debut year, he is doing quite well in his main role, hope he would get more main voice role in the upcoming future. Chtolly VA is one of the few VA I heard in the past anime, her roles are quite active and has decent and satisfying performance, overall most of the VA in it are very decent.\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend you guys to watch this anime, even though is more of drama, tragedy, romance genre type of setting, it has the slice of life feel to it too, and of course the fantasy since this takes place in the post-apocalyptic life, I\u2019m sure you guys would love it.\\n\\n\r\nWhat do you do at the end of the world?\\n\r\nAre you busy?\\n\r\nWill you save us?\\n\r\nDo you play Nintendo Switch?",

            "content": "I usually don't watch seasonals, moreover reviewing it the instant right after completing it, but for this occasions. I just can't help to do it. Yes, that's how \"Shuumatsu Nani Shitemasu ka? Isogashii desu ka? Sukutte Moratte Ii desu ka?\" or SukaSuka has tempt me by its bewitching allure. People may meme about how studio Trigger saved anime with their originals such as Inferno Cop, Kill la Kill, and other shows. But this word comes genuinely from my heart, without any sense of irony, in which that, SukaSuka is the flawed savior of anime.\r\nEnter Willem Kmetsch, a human survivor from the world destruction. As hemet Chtholly and worked as a carekeeper on her dormitory, he learned what does it takes to be a parent figure, and the importance of family itself.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the midst of superhero action anime and Light Novel adaptations with donkan overpowered protagonist which recently gets viral lately in terms of both popularity and quantity (or if I have to be more blunt, have plagued anime quality/is killing anime) yet I can never see much enjoyment or merit of them (such as Boku no Hero Academia, One Punch Man, and many other titles), experiencing SukaSuka is like finding a cure after being bit by 10 cobras. SukaSuka can be seen as a criticism for these types of anime but yet, it's still a really sincere work that doesn't come as being pompous on its criticism. It subverted the fundamental tropes of them. As much as I see the heroism theme portrayed in Boku no Hero Academia or being a donkan is the way to get girls attention are a total hypocrisy and delusional, I saw that the theme about heroism portrayed in SukaSuka as the most mature portrayal of it so far. The setting of SukaSuka is nothing new, but the implementations of it's core themes towards this kind of settings is what makes SukaSuka unique. I also found that this theme about family is rather barely explored in most anime so this is also where you can enjoy your stay for it.\\n\\n\r\nOur protagonist Willem, who now lives in a sky continent in a post-apocalyptic setting, begins like no more than your typical Light Novel self insert character. However, throughout the series, it's proven that despite being slightly dense, he never went full donkan that it makes his personality more believable. Despite also being quite overpowered to some extent, Willem has a worn-out bodies that limits him for being a Gary Stu and throughout the series, we can see on how his inner conflicts due to his undying fighting spirit in order to be a hero that fight against the beasts to protect the people. Or is it what it means to be a hero? Can it also mean about something else which is more trivial to be protected? Willem can be distinguished from your typical hero by his limitations in conjunction on the redefinition of what does it meant to be a hero.\\n\\n\r\nThe heroine, Chtholly Nota Seniorious, is a mysterious 15 year old Leprechaun whom little is known about her past until the series went further. Leprechauns are the continents trump card in their battle against the beasts, and they are trained in order to have no fear of death. However, due to their appearance that resembles those of humans, whom are thought to be the one responsible for the world destruction, they are being shunned by the common society and regarded as being \"featureless\". At the first few minutes of the anime, Willem saved Chtholly from slipping and being the object of hate by the mass, and then took her stroll together with him. After they lives together and he taught many thing Chtholly never feel before due to her lifestyle, she began to question whether all the \"fighting with bravery\" mindset which had been planted on her since her birth was really the way of living on its truest. Her quirks really shown in a detailed manner, more than even the protagonist, which makes the watcher attached to her all along to her, for a very nice reasons.\\n\\n\r\nTo be frank, the romantic relationship between the two main characters sprouts too fast. But once it sprouts, it develops in an excellent pace. The bashful nature of both parties, yet knowing that they do love each other can never fails to made me smile. Unlike many other romance I have experienced, SukaSuka gives both views towards the other, which is something important in order to make a good romance since I believe that romance is a double sided relationship and portrayal of just a single party will make the other party an object instead. SukaSuka knew this well and avoided it.\\n\\n\r\nPortrayal of humans on SukaSuka are very evil. It's believable on how the settings took place most likely on the far future where humans might got overboard with their greediness and exploitation. It serves as a contemplation for the watchers on what have we become so far, did we have turned to be nice to the mother earth or is it the opposite? Does all experiments make the world a better place? Homo homini lupus, and this actually fits really well after you learn some truth regarding the plot point. Of course, like other works which has living biological weapon plot point, it also portray on how it's unethical on the usage of it or I can say that war in general is a futility.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike most popular post-apocalyptic anime nowadays, the focus of SukaSuka isn't the action, but rather the family themed character drama instead, but it still realized that the characters are in a life and death situations without abusing many fight scenes. Balancing such a lighthearted tone with a darker one is hard, but it still manages to can have a mostly light tone without forgetting the situation they're in. More good news, this tone blends well with the core theme of he show.SukaSuka have an ok worldbuilding, in which starts out delivering few expositions towards the world they lived in, and manages to give a slow but steady and sufficient amount of it as the series progress. A lot of information still being missing however, but I can comprehend that since it only adapts about half of the Light Novel. It explained why the people took refuge on the sky island, how it was made, about the war against the beast in depth, and so on that the essential information make the watchers can follow the story easily. Sometimes, bombing the watchers with a lot of expositions is obnoxious, especially if done by monologues but none of them happens in SukaSuka and it feels natural. One other thing worth mention is that SukaSuka is feminist friendly, as how the Leprechauns done most of the fights while Willem being a nurturing figure for the Leprechauns. It also added by the fact Scarborough Fair was sung by a female singer, but use the masculine lyrics that modifies female third person into the male ones. Scarborough Fair also blends perfectly with the medieval esque settings of the Sky Island, to add up for the overall quality.\\n\\n\r\nDespite my praise, SukaSuka have a considerable amount of flaws too. The theme presentation is kind of childish for the earlier episodes and the type of comedy doesn't fit with the show settings, as most of them are more befitting to a school harem anime. The visuals is quite nice but can be improved in a lot of ways, especially the characters expressions most of the time. Lastly, due to the amount of focus to the main character, almost all of the side characters fell flat out one-dimensional which is barely memorable, although those who like characters with said personality might remember them very well. Aware with all these flaws, I still think that the pros really outweighs the cons.\\n\\n\r\nSukaSuka gets better over time and the ending made me overflowed with feels towards it. The slow motion scene power was also backed up with the song which have been tuned at the first episode. How the ambience, melody, and the lyrics can't fit any better to the situation they're on the ending is outstandingly scary. Trust me, even when the buildup from the prior episodes don't affect you that much, the ending is still golden, despite its predictability. The execution of cinematography went all out on the ending, especially that scene which is more than a satisfactory for me that usually don't feel for a melodrama. If such scene isn't emotionally engaging at the slightest, then I don't think emotionally engaging anime moments existed.\\n\\n\r\nSukaSuka is one of the best beverages for the pacifist soul like me, and it has become one of my most enjoyable anime so far, if not the most. It also restored my faith to seasonal anime and become my medicine for generic action anime nowadays. The accurate depiction and thought provoking message about what does it take to be a human, heroism for the adults, family, valuing the present over the past or a vague future, living one's own life to its fullest, and the delicate wrappings of all these mature themes into such story is what enchant me to this Light Novel adaptation. SukaSuka might not the savior the community deserves, but SukaSuka is the savior that the community needs.",

            "content": "I feel like that I can't give another 10 to an emotional anime now that I have seen this...\r\nSukasuka is the one anime that will linger in my heart for quite some time. It is also first drama/romance anime that made me want to re-watch. It's also a hard anime to describe with words; it's really an emotional roller coaster. But if I were to describe Sukasuka in terms of more popular anime, I'd describe it as what \"Violet Evergarden Should Have been\", or Anohana, or Clannad or whatever.\r\nThink of Sukasuka as an emotional movie that gets your heart into wrecks because it is comparableto, well actually better than a lot of emotional movies. It has perfect soundtracks played at the right time, with happy and sad themes to add more to the story. The soundwork for SukaSuka is one of the best, rivaling Violet Evergarden. The sounds add another dimension on this such already great anime.\\n\\n\r\nDespite it's long title (which made it subject to laughs of being an anime based off LN, which are quite full with mediocre stories), sukasuka has one of the best stories I have seen in anime so far. Well stories aside, it's phenomenal in ... just all departments.\\n\\n\r\nThe world building in Sukasuka is ONE OF THE BEST. I won't talk much about the story here, but from the first episode where Willem and Chtholly met, I could tell that there were much to be explored in this world with floating islands and fairies. Some LN readers have complained that this anime is not full adaptation of the 5 novels, but the anime by itself completes Chtholly's story (and in a good fashion) too. There is a beginning, the roller coaster then the resolution. It's not like many other LN adaptation where it is cut off in the middle.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason I gave a 9 on the enjoyment is because the empty sensation that comes as a result of finishing this anime. It's been several weeks since I finished this series, but I still yearn to find another series like this. A lot of anime looks pretty shit now that I have seen this. I am really sad that this anime doesn't get the attention it deserves. The production and the story is top-tier, levels ahead of majority of popular anime.\\n\\n\r\nTL; DR: A Masterpiece (coming from a guy with really low MAL avg ratings)\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "SukaSuka is set in a post-apocalyptic future where Wilhelm, the last surviving human, is brought out of an icy sleep after centuries when his kind was wiped out by supernatural beings called Beasts and he becomes a paternal figure to a number of young girls who are leprechauns, beings capable of wielding powerful magical swords that can slay the Beasts at the cost of the wielder's life force and personality for each time they fight.\r\nIn terms of plotting, the series is a mixed bag having its high and low points. Starting with the positive end, the series does a solid job with focusing on thecharacters of Wilheim and Ctholly, one of the leprechaun girls he develops a bond throughout the course of the series. Both have their unique struggles they are dealing with throughout the series with Wilheim adjusting to the new world he is unexpectedly part of and Ctholly being different from other leprechauns in that she fears facing death while others of her kind are fearless in facing it due to being created as such. It also takes time to explore elements of the world of its series where mythical creatures have come to take humanity's place in existing after its extinction and have survived by living on floating islands to avoid many of the Beasts that have taken control over the ground. The second half of the series also progressively gets better as Wilheim and Ctholly's bond develops and tragedy starts to strike with Ctholly slowly falling victim to the deterioration of her body from use of her sword.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, SukaSuka does suffer a good deal with its first half and dealing with its other characters. The first half of the series falls into the usual bad habit of a number of anime with attempting to poorly implement comedy during serious situations in an attempt to balance out its more somber mood. In addition, the series did get inconsistent with its plotting direction at points in its first half where the show shifted focus away from Ctholly's situation and attempted to focus on side plots involving the other leprechauns. While focus on the side characters may have been worthwhile if this were a longer series, this isn't the case with SukaSuka and said side plots derail focus on its main plot involving Ctholly and Wilheim's characters. Also not helping matters is that beyond Ctholly and Wilhelm, the majority of other characters don't get much in the way of fleshing out as they are reduced to simple archetypes and seemingly only exist to contrast the characters or advance the show's plot into a certain direction.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I suppose my reception to SukaSuka is mixed. While having a decent amount of world building and a strong second half focusing on the bond between our two major characters, the series still suffered from a first half that struggled to find a solid direction for its plot, needless implementation of humor, and the majority of its cast being underdeveloped compared to Wilhelm and Ctholly. It is an okay fantasy-based drama with what it offers up, but far from being the best anime I have come across this year thus far.",

At the start, I will write, when I read the LN, it hurts me, but I was not able to stop because the characters and story were really good. Anime is a really good adaptation for this LN.\r\nStory 9/10\r\nFrom episode 1 you can guess in what direction this anime will be going. This is not your typical fighting or happily ever after anime. This anime focus more on way of thinking. How beastman people see this little girls as weapons andthey don\u00b4t care if they lose their life or not. How our MC sees this little girls different, because of his past and his feelings or how Nygglatho have a different point of view on the whole situation. It is a story about a promise, fear, desire to love and to be loved. \\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\\n\r\nWell, there are some truly amazing scenes. But sometimes you see that there was probably not enough of budget.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI guess that everyone who watch this anime understand.

For example, Scarborough Fair version was outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9/10\\n\\n\r\nWillem, Kutori, Nygglatho, girls, I think it is really hard to don\u00b4t like them. They offer you a different point of view on the whole situation. Also Kutori x Willem interaction is in my opinion really nicely done. Also, Willem x girls\u00b4 interaction or Willem x Ren interaction is truly cute.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I really enjoy the story. Don\u00b4t expect a fighting anime or some fan-service. This anime is simply focused on feelings. Love, fear, tragedy and more, you will find them all.",

Oh hell yeah I was wrong.I got really surprised by the story evolving, transforming, and ending in that way. I cried a bit, too. I'm weak to emotional stories.\\n\\n\r\nYeah, this anime is a tragedy. Prepare to cry. Try not to. Cry a lot. Keep tissues close.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is seriously the revelation of this Spring 2017 season without any doubt. I can't say I'm not happy to get surprised like this. This anime was in my \"maybe\" list and revealed itself one of my new favourites. I hope now the animes I think I'll like won't let me down.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now, to the \"detailed\" review. It may contain slight spoilers, but I'll avoid spoiling too much. Readers are advised.\\n\\n\r\nNot everything is sunshine and rainbows, and so it is this anime.\\n\\n\r\nBut what it made this anime outstandingly good is not because \"I know this will have a bad end or a good end with an huge deus ex machina\" but because the way characters behaved during the story.\\n\r\nIt's all about the journey, not the destination.\\n\\n\r\nI've seen more pure characters and feelings in these 12 episodes than in all the series I watched in the last year so far. Not even a single bit of ecchiness/dumbness in the scenes, and all the relationships between characters were genuine and sweet. It was relaxing, yet, thanks to the soundtracks, even with very few fighting scenes, you could feel all the tragic and emotional moments perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nThat's what made a difference, in my opinion, between this anime, and a lot of other similar-setted LN adaptations.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't miss the lack of action at all.\\n\\n\r\nWhat made this anime was the beautiful art, the soundtracks and the feelings of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not all about fights. Even though they decide everything in the end.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's what the plot is about.\\n\r\nGoing on fighting will destroy you.\\n\r\nSo...will you?",

            "content": "Who knew something titled\u00a0WorldEnd: What do you do at the end of the world? Are you busy? Will you save us? would end up making you sad by the end?\r\nWorldEnd is an anime adaptation of the novel series of the same name by Akira Kareno. The story takes place far into the future after the human race has gone extinct and the surface of the Earth has been ravaged by the mysterious \"Beasts,\" leaving only similar anthropomorphic creatures left on floating islands above the surface.\r\nThe series follows the normal Willem Kmetsch and the blue-haired heroine Chtholly, both of whom are one of the \"disfeatured\" whichare seen as outcasts in this new world, as Willem takes a job as a caretaker at the orphanage Chtholly lives at. The orphanage is special however, it's a military base for the girls living there who are the only ones who can fight off the Beasts living on the surface and protect the islands in the sky.\\n\\n\r\nThe world itself is one that is portrayed beautifully. Usually the characters are only shown on the surface of the floating islands which look no different from normal terrain, but when the show displays more grandiose sweeping shots of the islands it can't make but trigger at least some sense of awe. The character designs for the traditional characters aren't anything too special, but I really like the designs of the other creatures; They all remind me of some of the older Disney movies' character designs.\\n\\n\r\nSince the girls at the orphanage are just weapons used to fight the Beasts, it's shown early on that none of them have a fear or disgust of death. They are expected to die when they are of the age to fight, and every reminder of this fact was an emotional one even at the beginning. While all of the girls do fall into one of the many typical anime stereotypes, it hardly felt relevant since that unique situation they were all in added more depth and variety that you wouldn't normally find with these characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe relationship between Willem and the other girls living at the orphanage\u00a0is one that grows over time in believable way. Willem and Chtholly are obviously made out to be a couple and are developed as such which I found to have a realistic progression, even if it felt like their specific relationship was moving faster than a Formula One car at times.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, Willem was somewhat of a misstep. He didn't get near enough development. They show plenty of his back story throughout the anime, but it all felt rushed and didn't fully explain how he got to where he is now. They seemed to have skipped a huge portion of background that would've been nice to know. Having some more time dedicated to fleshing out Willem could have gone a long way.\\n\\n\r\nIn typical anime fashion there are times of innuendo and fan service, but they are very few and far between. And there are a few jokes made in relation to Willem being extremely comfortable with children, insinuating he might secretly be into children, but these are never taken anywhere, and his relationship with the younger girls is purely that of a father with his daughters.\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned previously, the girls are expected to fight against the Beasts, and sometimes, in order to defeat them, they have to sacrifice themselves, hence why they have no fear of death. That's the way it has been which is fine, but it felt incredibly unrealistic when Willem came in and showed them the possibility of a different way to defeat the Beasts that doesn't require the sacrifice of one of the girls. This outsider who's only been working there for a few weeks comes in and completely shakes the foundation of what they've been doing for seemingly generations, and Chtholly is the only one to find this in the least bit strange. It's fully explained why Willem would have this knowledge in the first place, but the fact everyone just accepted it without any questions didn't feel very believable.\\n\\n\r\nIt's slowly revealed throughout the series the true nature of the girls living at the orphanage. Without going into spoiler territory, every new revelation brings new insight into this world and how it's changed since the humans were in control. But the new revelations also bring with it new senses of unease. As you learn more and more, you can start to see where things are going, and where it's going isn't good. There's an event around halfway through that causes the rest of the series to have this looming despair over it.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of story beats in this show are things I feel like I've seen in other shows, but the way they're all combined is masterful and breathes new life into every one of them. By the time the anime is reaching its end, you know where the show is going and dreading it the whole time. The entire final arc of the show is just a\u00a0crescendo to its dramatic conclusion. While the entire finale is an intense emotional roller coaster, it never felt cheap in its attempt to make you feel emotional and all felt believable. The ending also leaves a hint of mystery in it which leaves the possibility of a sequel which the original novel series already has.\\n\\n\r\nWorldEnd is an amalgamation of many familiar ideas and tropes, but the ways in which they all interact is something that should be seen. It keeps everything feeling fresh from episode to episode with very few missteps. There are portions of fan service that felt unnecessary and parts that could have been better communicated, but those aren't close to deal breakers by any means.",

Once you feel like everything is going to be perfect and its going to turn out great for everyone shit hits the fan and it hits hard. Honestly i cant say much but its absolutely a great anime theres almost nothing wrong with it which is why for the most part i gave it solid tens up until we hit enjoyment because its great but it just kind of depresses you in the final minutes. Other than that another great touchis just how every side character no matter how small the roll they held is is just packed full of emotion and is even fleshed out a bit. If you pay attention to the background you can even see some of the side characters doing what you would expect them to do and there really isn't any sudden changes to them or they just vanish after a scene to never appear again you see them more than once even if its because well they were brutally murdered. Anyways just an absolute masterpiece full of just outstanding character development and the much loved classic anime art style as well as a beautiful story and some absolutely crisp and clean sound unless you blew out your speakers.",

            "content": "In his essay Toward an Aesthetic of Reception, the prominent literary theorist Hans Robert Jauss used the metaphor of \u00ab culinary \u00bb art in order to designate and criticize a certain type of art that contents itself with using commonplaces, conforming to the public's taste and refraining from making bold or demanding artistic choices.\r\nSukaSuka, in my opinion, matches perfectly with this definition: its writing and execution lazily follow hackneyed recipes, which prevents the anime from being anything else than a juxtaposition of trite tropes and plot devices. \r\nThis review will delve into the main reasons why I found it very difficult to get immersed inSukaSuka's story, or even to simply take it seriously.\\n\r\nThe most evident one, which I mentioned a bit already, pervades every level of the anime; it is the fact that the plot, worldbuilding and characters of the show all correspond to commonplaces of generic light novel adaptations. For instance, all the members of the main cast strictly follow archetypes like the tragic tsundere, the outgoing neko girl, or the overpowered protagonist most women are in love with. The characters' personalities are justified by the plot, though not always very convincingly, but they cruelly lack something that would humanize them. Their actions, designs, and above all the voice acting, which is especially trite, are so clich\u00e9d that they make it nearly impossible to suspend one's disbelief and see those characters as anything else than mere plot devices. The often out of place otaku-bait that are the couple of borderline hentai scenes and Ithea's metatextual jokes undermine any suspension of disbelief even more, and are representative of another one of SukaSuka's writing issues: its lack of coherence.\\n\\n\r\nIndeed, the anime's plot is both full of holes and extremely unequally distributed between the episodes. It generally is developed through some unclear and heavy exposition scenes, and most of it is only explained in the penultimate episode. Consequently, during most of the anime, it is impossible for the viewers to really grasp what is happening to the characters, as they don't yet know the rules that govern their world. Therefore, each new plot point fells like it comes out of left field and lacks a logical explanation, which damages the sense of continuity and the coherence of the narrative. The main female character, Chtolly, also acts and thinks very inconsistently; her personality changes from scene to scene in a way that is jarring and hard to believe.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of these inconsistencies can be attributed to a wish from the writer to create dramatic tension at all costs. As a matter of fact, none of the anime's ideas and themes are properly explored, as it limits itself to scenes that aim at causing an emotional reaction in the viewers. In truth, even when one looks at it in hindsight, SukaSuka's story doesn't make much sense: its historical context and its magic system seem like they exist only to justify the fact that children are used as weapons, that the main characters are special and that they find themselves in tear-jerking situations despite being overpowered. The romance between the two protagonists is as banal and mawkish as it is unrealistic, and only adds to the impression that the writing of the show is deplorably superficial.\\n\\n\r\nOn top of having a weak plot, SukaSuka suffers from inept execution. In particular, the arrangement of its different scenes doesn't allow for the building of a harmonious atmosphere. In addition to the fact that the scenes that contain essential information for the story are often given less attention than insignificant ones, they follow one another extremely abruptly without there being a sense of cohesion between them. The exposition, whose role is crucial in any story to establish a sort of author-reader contract, is by far the worse part of the series: it haphazardly mixes tones and juxtaposes different commonplaces and techniques, which for the majority of them never reappear again. This tendency to clumsily blend different kinds of atmosphere is a recurring feature of the anime, which is at its worst at the end of episode two, when a scene which is supposed to be sad and emotional is immediately followed by an especially distasteful fan service moment. The presence of  fillers even though the series is only twelve episodes long goes to show how badly its screen time was allocated.\\n\\n\r\nFrom a technical standpoint, SukaSuka is not the worst of series, but it doesn't really shine either. Its cinematography varies from generic mediocrity to incompetence, its average OST is used in a cheesy manner that participates in its poor handling of ambiance, and most of its designs are uninspired. Those of the animal-people, of the evil beasts and of the flying boats are awful, but those of the main characters, as well as the setting, are about passable.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the dialogues, they are of the lowest quality: not only are they stereotyped and devoid of any aesthetic concern, but they also waste an incredible amount of time making references to things both the characters and the viewers already know, without elaborating on them. Sometimes, they also do the opposite by hinting at things or mentioning subjects so vaguely that one only ends up equally if not more confused after the dialogue than before.\\n\\n\r\nTo put it in a nutshell, SukaSuka is not an interesting anime. It doesn't seem to truly understand the codes and tropes it is made of and handles them in an amateurish manner, to such an extent that it sometimes feel insulting. It has no soul, no depth, no originality, there is no reason to watch it.",

Although, the story telling here  mainly focuses on building the relationship between those that our MC is looking after, learning more about our MC's past, who the children or the people that the MC is looking after are, and just overall, not really moving the plot forward all that much for that reason. That's not to say that this quality for an anime or a story is bad, but it just gets abit boringu know. Despite that, the setting is unique, the character are unique (since there are also some non human character as well in the show),the story is pretty interesting, some scene is very unique which gives off that movie vibes to it, and the romance is somewhat different from the cliche ones that we usually see in anime (personality or attitude wise). The anime sure knows how to keep the thrill and the suspense of the show by giving foreshadows and ominous scene to make the show interesting. It also gives u a moderate amount of info about the MC's past or other character's, and manages to make all the character introduced thus far less of an irrelevant, or a CPU like character that's just there as a nobody to move the plot forward. This anime get emotional at times, and it can also deliver some of the philosophical lines that are pretty quotable, as it's a word talking as if it's from an experience of the character that have had experience hardship, or faced a multitude of human nature's shape and actions from the past (at least from the author's perspective). \\n\\n\r\nThis show is one of the most unique show of this season, surely you would give this a try?",

It's like a ribbon that you keep on tying until it becomes a knot you can't untangle, at least that's how I would best describe the plot. Even after the end of the season I never got a proper understanding of what's going on; the anime informs us about gods, comrades(from the past) and many other without a proper explanation. \r\n    However, the anime has, what I believe to be, great characters and character developments whichmakes anime even more enticing because you wouldn't want them to die. The art was also pretty good, the flying islands, the people, and different structures along with the beasts was enjoyable. As for the sound, I never really payed attention so I'll just give it a 7. \\n\r\n    Overall, this anime is enjoyable and does pretty well in each genre, including suspense even though the plot is terrible. \\n",

Believe me, this made me cry!!!!\r\nThe story is about Willem, he was a Hero who fight for humanity. Fast forward he was lost, and then 500 years later he was found by someone. After he awakes, he found that human race has gone extinct. The story is begin from that.\r\n-Story: 10/10\r\nAt the first episode I had a feeling that this could be a great adaptation, and it turn to be correct! This is drama, but NOT cliche one. This is not action, but moreto slice of life. You can see the character development as the story goes.\\n\\n\r\nBut if you expect action from this series, it won't connect. Maybe that's why lots of people disappointed by this series.\\n\\n\r\nNote: The last episode is the greatest, it made me cry.\\n\\n\r\n-Art: 9/10\\n\r\nThe art is not like Ufotabe, but you'll be able to feel the sad atmosphere here. This is definitely suits the anime.\\n\\n\r\n-Sound: 9/10\\n\r\nOne of factors that made me cry is the music.\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nThe story never make me bothered. I'm waiting this every week. FYI, I dropped all this season (spring 2017) animes except this one.\\n\\n\r\n-Overal: 10/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nBut like I said, if you like pure action, you might not like this series.",

Most people existing now are of new races (furries), and someone like Willem is considered a freak of nature looking the way he does, with no animal traits or anything.\r\nShuumatsu Nani Shitemasu ka? Isogashii desu ka? Sukutte Moratte Ii desu ka? or just SKSK is a deceptive anime when given its premise, as Willem gets assigned a new job with barely any requirements it appears that he will be taking careof what appear to be a lot of tiny girls.\\n\\n\r\nNow, Willem working as the caretaker for these leprechauns, is going to go through a lot of things and experience what it's like being the person who has to await for their dear ones to return from the frontlines.\\n\\n\r\nSKSK is a 12 episode anime that explores a new angle of war, rarely do we ever have the main character being someone not working at the frontline but instead can only hope the girls sent out all come home back unscathed.\\n\\n\r\nIn a steampunk like world, we get to see a man with a troubled past taking care of young girls with no attachment or value to their lives, knowing they are made for the sole purpose to fight until they break or succeed in their missions. Willem slowly lets himself open up and adopts them as his own, but as he opens more and more of himself to these soldiers, the more vulnerable he makes himself.\\n\\n\r\nWitnessing some of the most organic development of love and tragedy. With interesting showcase of both the heartwarming home life and the heartbreaking reality of war. Every episode left me either with a feel good sensation or nervous nail biting hoping everything will turn out alright.\\n\\n\r\nFor people who enjoy action (from street fights to monster slaying) and seeing a ragtag bunch of people creating a powerful bond worthy of being considered a true family, SKSK is a 12 episode anime I highly recommend.\\n\r\nAs the story progress, we get to know more of what happen to the world, what role Willem once played and the truths behind the leprechauns.\\n\\n\r\nIf the very first minute of the first episode (exactly 1minute) catches your attention, then you will enjoy this anime. Honestly, if the first minute truly hooked you, do not drop the anime and stick to the very end.\\n\r\nThis anime will have a fair share of slice of life episodes mixed with the war, as those parts are incredibly important for Willem's character development and for us as an audience to understand the adorable leprechauns (and how the people of the world seems them).\\n\\n\r\nAs someone who have not read the light novels, I am saved by ignorance not knowing if the story missed out on anything vital. But for what the anime was by itself, it was one of the best ones I watched this season.",

It definitely had more of an impact from other Magical girl anime I've seen.\r\nAnimation 7: This had two studios doing the animation which was surprising. It was nothing breathtaking but they did a good job with the fights and that's what was important in my eyes.\r\nSound/Music 10: The BGM was flawless, it synced up so well with what was going on I really have nothing bad to say about it. The op and ed were above average as well.\r\nCharacter/VA 9: Willem may be the best MaleMC of the season (Besides your Hero Academy and AoT characters) he made this show more awesome then it already was. Ren, Chtholly, Ithea, Nygglatho, and basically all the girls in the Warehouse were fantastic.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9: The characters made this anime awesome again. My heart was swayed at certain points and I felt captivated at the ending and it made me want more.\\n\\n\r\nOverall View\\n\r\nOne of the best anime of the season in my eyes. They didn't go into to much of the romance but it was kept there to keep things light at points. Overall this was a pretty dark anime. These girls have one job to do and once that job is over...well you'll just have to watch and find out what happens when their job is over.\\n\r\nI'd recommend this to anyone looking for an anime with a strong Male MC, some really good action, and a lot of cute girls being badasses.",

            "content": "I do not often cry from watching shows or movies, but this anime proved to be one of the few that coaxed several tears from my eyes. I loved this anime. \r\nFrom the start, it didn't seem like it would become a favourite of mine. Despite being well paced and having an intriguing concept, shows in this kind of fantasy realm tend to be divided into either really good or really bad (from my experience). By the end of this show, I realized it was one of the really good ones. \r\nIn terms of story, like I said, it has a interesting concept and ithas a good pace. It fleshes out several characters well, and creates an accurate ambiance of a world at war. It answers interesting questions it poses, like where Willem comes from, what leprauchans are, etc. And it shows what happiness is. That happiness is much more simple than you'd think, and that it is still possible when there is war. Leading up to the finale, it has a sort of slice-of-life feel (for people in war circumstances) where information is slowly given to answer said questions and lead up to the explosive ending. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are great, fleshed out well enough and avoiding those annoying 2D stock-personality types (for example, tsundere). The music, too, is lovely. I think it had one of the most impressive openings of the season, and the songs that arose during certain scenes were good in supporting the appropriate mood.\\n\\n\r\nOnce again, I loved this anime. The finale was well executed and made me cry, but it also left a kind of hope-mixed-with-sorrow feeling at the end.  I cannot give it 10/10 though, because I think that it didn't answer all of the questions I was curious about/vaguely answered some. I guess I wanted closure on whether or not the world was doomed, but not getting that answer may be the point.\\n\\n\r\nHopefully I've done a good job explaining. I believe it is definitely a worthwhile show.",

            "content": "DISCLAIMER: everything written here is my personal opinion.\r\nThis show gave me a great experience and great dissapointment at the same time.\r\nWhen going into worldend I didn't exactly have high expectations. I thought this would just be a casual novel addaptation (which explains the long title) (later I also discovered that the original novel seems to be pretty damn good). I was suprised however. I went into the story and saw great potential. The show kept pulling me back which is a good thing but as it progressed I realised it could have been so much better.\r\nProgression and story:\r\nFirst of all I think the series istoo short to completely explore the universe and its characters. Although this isn't a valuable point because this could be caused by things the author could not change. But what the author could have changed was to correctly choose which elements to include and which not. When watching I constantly had the feeling that the auther could have used the 20min time better. \\n\\n\r\nIt is in fact a great story but due to its poor execute, it dissapoints. The author really tried to focus on the romance instead of the action, this became clear very quickly. In the beginning of the series he held on to it fairly well although when reaching the end this seems to shift. This wasn't actually that bad because it increased the dramatic end of the series but the sudden shift did hit me. A show in comparison who did the same thing in a better manner in my opinion is Angel Beats (I won't go into a comparison but go watch the show and compare them, you won't regret it ;) ).\\n\\n\r\nSometimes the story was a bit predictable in the romance part but the rest were all suprises for me. I really thought i figured out the story but it manages to suprise you everytime pieces of info about the backstories are given.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending also gave me mixed feelings. It seemed right and well executed but it also felt like the author was thinking: \"This is going well, oh sh*t I'm already at episode 10 I need to finish it real quick\".\\n\\n\r\nThe story is unique and compelling but not always executed in the right way. But for my score I will not base myself just on the execution but also the story potential.\\n\\n\r\nstory potential: 10/10\\n\r\nstory execution: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe series gives you a set of likeable girls which each have their own personality. From big breasted maids to loli's to tsundere's. In my opinion are the characters really well done and you realy care for them when you get to know them. It is a shame that we didn't get to meet all the girls very well but you can't fit it all in 12 episodes. The ones that were followed where done in the right way. I think everyone would find at least one character that they like.\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters were OK. They were predictable sometimes but I did grow to like them. Chtholly (main heroin) was one who gave me some trouble though. It's not that I don't like her but it's just that she seems like a victim all the times. I do like that she is very honest regarding her feelings and doesn't beat around the bush to much. The MC's are written that you exually do believe they would be a good couple.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe show started out strong and got my attention. In the beginning the story compelled me and got me hyped for the next episode, but when finished I could just cast the show aside. \\n\r\nI came for the story and stayed for the OST.\\n\\n\r\nAs a conclusion I would say this show got my interest, but is not memorable at all. It took my interest and just disposed of it when I finished the show. Like other series with great story, I want to know more about the world and the characters, but somehow this series got me to just cast them aside and move on, which is a bummer.\\n\\n\r\nShould you watch this series? Definitely! Although not executed in the best way the story is interesting and compelling and the characters are likeable. Will it be the best anime-experience you ever had? Probably not. But if your looking for some series with great plot and good romance. Worldend is a series for you.",

It's a roller coaster of emotion that is superbly executed from the first episode to the last one.

On the one hand I think it's a genuinely good effort, but on the other I can see some things wrong with it which not only ruin the experience but also the world and immersion the anime is trying to create.\r\nSo, in the end, did I like SukaSuka?\r\nShort answer: yes.\r\nLong answer:\r\nWhile the concept and the brief snippets of the story that I had heard prior to watching it interested me enough to make me want to pick it up as my only anime for Spring 2017, I found that the execution waslackluster in some areas. It had definite tinges of anime-like, or more appropriately, LN-like story telling and presentation and while that in itself isn't a bad thing, I feel like for this particular anime it hurt its overall atmosphere and the feel it's trying to create.\\n\\n\r\nSo what do I mean by \"anime-like\" story telling and presentation?\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, I want to address the small problems that I had with it, that while not deal-breaking were definitely things that could have been done better. Sword design is one of these issues. I love swords and there are a great many swords with iconic designs all throughout anime (take Excalibur or Guts' sword for example) and the one thing most of these great swords have in common is simple but effective design. SukaSuka doesn't adhere to that design philosophy and instead opts to create complex looking but very boring and unmemorable swords which just leave a bad taste in my mouth.\\n\r\nEnough about swords though, the other minor thing that bugged me was monster design. Again instead of making any sort of memorable monsters the anime just creates these blobs of eyes and tentacles and calls it a day.\\n\\n\r\nSo the more major problems I had with the anime were the character interactions. They often felt wooden and forced, with no fault of the voice actors mind you, the dialogue was just not very well written to begin with. When I hear the characters talk I don't really feel like I'm watching a real conversation, but more like two people mindlessly bouncing off each other in a way that felt unnatural. There were, of course, times when the anime would create actual dialogue, such as in the more emotional scenes between our two main characters.\\n\r\nSpeaking of our two main characters, the budding romance between them is portrayed in a way that I feel appropriate from the standpoint of fifteen year old Chtholly with no previous love experience at all. It's cute and awkward just how you'd expect it to be. What you wouldn't expect is the older Willem acting like he's also fifteen at times, but that could be blamed on his previous experiences and his lone wolf nature.\\n\r\nOverall the romance was one of the stronger parts of the series, even if it felt drawn out towards the end.\\n\\n\r\nThe action scenes feel like they're just there to fill time and move the plot, nothing special. Fights usually end in a couple of blows and even though most of the main cast has big swords and magic powers they don't really use them in any impressive way. But I guess that's fair considering action is not the main focus of the show, still, if you're going to put in some action at least make it more entertaining. And no, big magic explosions are not entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nThe story has a few interesting twists and turns that I dare not spoil here, but they're what made me want to watch more and got me genuinely interested in the world. As bland as the world before the present time seemed at the beginning, the anime sure made me want to hear more of it by the end. The anime has a few episodes where it feels like it meanders about and nothing really happens, a certain dog noble comes to mind, but these moments are used well enough to further the relationship of our two main characters that it didn't really bother me.\\n\r\nAs a whole, the characters, story and world all have a sort-of nihilistic tone which I did enjoy. It's the overdone story of \"humanity is bad and they should feel bad\", but it's not so in-your-face as you might see in other shows. The show takes care to also show the good side of humanity, or at least, the good side of the last human.\\n\r\nOn a side note, I find it weird that the animal-folk call Willem a \"disfeatured\", but seem perfectly fine with Nygllatho and the fairies who for all intents and purposes look one hundred percent human. And as a side note to my side note, the names in the anime are ridiculous and whoever came up with them needs to stop making unpronounceable gibberish and calling it a name.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, in conclusion, SukaSuka is an enjoyable anime with a few flaws that I can overlook and some that are more difficult to glance over. It feels very much like a story that would be told within an anime, very much like a story that would be targeted specifically at otakus and I'd have a hard time recommending this to someone who isn't already a devoted member of the anime fandom. If you are, however, one such person then I would recommend SukaSuka if you're looking for a fantasy anime, or a romance anime. While not as good as some others in those genres I still enjoyed my time with it.",

            "content": "....Shuumatsu Nani Shitemasu ka? Isogashii desu ka? Sukutte Moratte Ii desu ka? or SukaSuka for short (which LA will be say for the rest of the review), is one of the better fantasy animes to comes out of Spring 2017 for having a different take on it's genre as well as blending in both romance, slice of life and action into a nice mix.\r\nSukaSuka by some means did catch LA's interest in the plot at first especially with it's intriguing concept of having young girls of the Leprechaun fairy species be essentially human kamikazes and defeat \"Beasts\" that roam this fantasy world, theother interesting catch was Willem voiced by Ryohei Arai the newest \"caretaker\" of these young girls and him having a connections (indirectly) to the cause of the Leprechaun's use in the new fantasy world Willem now lives in. \\n\\n\r\nNow SukaSuka with an interesting premise and fantasy does have some flaws albeit small. For one thing, it takes time for the build up of this anime to get itself going, by pretty much go into long exposition about it's world, the Leprechaun's or the fantasy military that Willem and a few veteran fairies are established to, to random tasks or missions not involving taking down the Beasts comes up and their more non sequitur \"trying to develop the world\", but is more on Willem and his beliefs of his new world instead. Now THIS is a good thing as it gives us context (yet at some times vague underlying notions) to the situation and the build up to all this does have it's rewards, but sometimes the exposition does go hand in hand with random slice of life moments that has no bearing to the plot at times. The other is the obvious romantic feelings that one of our main heroine's Chtholly Nota Seniorious voiced by Azusa Tadakoro have for Willem is blatantly obvious BUT thankfully this anime does not go in the route of \"twice shy\" and heck even then Chtholly and Willem does progress in their relationship instead of leaving at a standstill twice shy romance, however because of the genre this anime is in, it does tend to go in the melodramatic though it's also countered by not completely wallowing in it. Lastly and this is LA's little nitpick but the minor cast especially when it concerns the younger fairies don't get much screentime compared to say Nopht, Ithea and Nephren, LA did wish they got more and the only of the younger members of the fairies that gets slightly developed is Tiat, but LA's defence with that is that this is more Willem and Chtholly's story than anything.\\n\\n\r\nOne of SukaSuka's major strengths however is keeping it's blend of slice of life, fantasy, romance and action into a nice mix in which either element doesn't swallow the other one up from having a healthy romantic plotline between Chtholly and Willem with some pseudo-comedic moments to lighten up the mood, with heavy drama when it needs to be serious and slice of life just so that we can take all of this in, the nice balance is one of the defining strengths for SukaSuka for LA  as well as keeping it's plot twists have a MAJOR impact on not only Willem and his situation but huge world building to add to it affecting the majority of the cast that has involvement with it. Hell some of action battles have the eldritch abomination vs. the underdog kind of feel to it and with the added effects of \"anyone can die\" along with characters we god damn care about due to their development from the slice of life elements allows the battles to be given the needed tension it needs to make the battles that much impactful to the story....or blindsides us and gives us a bait and switch which SukaSuka ALSO does well.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation by Satelight, the animation has it's unique style to it being one part traditional animation and part sketchy underlines. LA loves the character designs especially Chtholly with her giant witches hat and although the character designs are very well done and exotic to one another it does kinda follow the same face syndrome in many ways (just change the color of certain characters and hairstyles...it's extremely similar!), LA just loved the level of detail to it's character designs, it's backgrounding was also very well done bringing us the same level of detail and to add to that, the battles were fluid and gory and not afraid to show blood is good on LA's books. Satelight outdid themselves with their color paletting and overall animation for this anime.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of voice acting, yes LA knows that some characters are done by actual kid voice actors and LA does praise SukaSuka for that, especially when one character is one of the major focus to the plot with a link to Chtholly (that being Okada Hikari), but nonetheless this along with the kid voice actors is a stellar voice cast from Kikuko Inoue as Nygglatho, Shigeru Chiba as Grick Graycrack and Akari Uehara as Nephren but LA's favourite voice actor easily goes to Azusa Tadokoro as Chtholly, as it almost felt like Azusa knew and embodied Chtholly's character and all. Stellar voice cast.\\n\\n\r\nSukaSuka is definitely one of fantasy animes from Spring 2017 YOU NEED to watch and although it has it's problems in certain areas from it's focused plot to expanding it's world building through long exposition and sometimes moodwhiplashing tendencies, but makes up for it in terms of investment especially concerning Willem and Chtholly as well as it's world building and LA will say that even if the finale gives us a climax that essentially rear it's ugly head and the tears that it will follow, it does tell us something about morality, fate and identity through our main romantic leads of Willem and Chtholly. Is this the most interesting and new fantasy anime to come out of Spring 2017?...yes, is it the best anime this season?, for LA not quite...but it's Top 10 material that's for sure. SukaSuka by all accounts for LA is pretty much one of the dark horses for Spring 2017 and it did deliver on LA's expectations as well as it's own ambitions of high fantasy.",

            "content": "So, how exactly do I feel about Shuumatsu Anani Shitemasu- f*ck it, let's just refer it to what basically everyone else calls it, SukaSuka! (or WorldEnd if you're one of those live-actionboos). Well, the simple answer is divided. Divided amongst myself. I really, quite honestly, don't know whether I should utterly hate this masterpiece or shower it with love like a little kitty who got its tail whipped. After the last episode, I want to hate it. I should hate it. But I can't. It's just like a broken relationship, in ways. \r\nThe story follows Willem. Willem? As in, the man who invented the Willemscream? He's some humane individual who meets a similar but not humane individual named Chtholly. However the hell you pronounce that I don't know, but I don't care because she is amazing. Anyways, Willem screaming man becomes the caretaker for humanities most destructive weapon: Lolis! Anyways, these Lolis are apparently weapons that use weapons (?!?!?!?) and kill a bunch of beasts that were unleashed by humans, because, well, humans suck. 3D humans suck. \\n\\n\r\nSo at the \"warehouse\", Willem screaming man meets Chtholly of course but also meets Nephren, quite possibly the cutest girl ever, and Ithea, quite possibly the best neko ever. Later on we meet 2 more girls who I really don't give a shit about, as one of them is an Ithea ripoff and the other just sucks. But looking past the main 3 we have the troll, uhh I forgot her name so let's just refer to her as princess Fionna? Looking past that, we have the stars of the show, the lolis!! Although I can't remember most of their names, I rememer all of them and they were all beautiful. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough I keep having past life memories, the one thing I can REALLY remember about SukaSuka is the soundtrack. From \"Scarborough Fair\" to \"Always in my heart full\" to the awesome opening and emotional ending themes, the soundtrack of Shuumatsu Nani Shitemasu Ka is one of the best i've ever heard in anime. I just wanna smash and mash a potato against the wall and bawl my eyes out until, well, I bawl my eyes out. Go on youtubby and search for one of those songs and prepare for a sad day. As for the art and animation, it's really not much special. The animation though can be really good when it wants to be, especially on the first and last episodes. Certain character designs though, especially for Cthkolly, ithaea, and nefrrem were absolute genius and will \"draw you in\". \\n\\n\r\nTo end it all off, this series will keep you super invested. You will likely be developing feelings and dating this anime up until the last episode, when it breaks up with you, leaving you in heartache, but not being able to hate it. So it gets like an 8.5 from me.\\n\\n\r\nSeriously though, this anime is in DESPERATE need for a season 2. There's so much more of a story just waiting to be explored. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nSoundtrack: 10/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.6/10",

It could be better to extend the feeling between Chtholly and William. I wonder how the light novel author feel after watching this? \\n\r\nI gave it a score of 8 for the story and OP. \\n",

            "content": "If I had to summarize this anime in just a few words  it would be \"deathflag- the anime\". That said it's so much more. It's an extremely underrated gem, that while definitely is not for everyone it will leave a lasting impression in the heads.. and hearts of most people. And that's why I decided to make my very first review on any anime hoping to help someone discover this gem.. a lot of us know stumbling onto something really good can take a long time of searching and disappointments and if this helps at least 1 person discover it I couldn't ask foranything more.\\n\\n\r\nI started watching it on the spring 2017 anime season when it started airing. Didn't expect anything out of it.. weirdly long anime name with the blue haired crying girl protagonist on a cover with a fancy hat and a sword. only 3 out of the 12 episodes we're online at that point and though I usually binge-watch all my anime when all the episodes of the season are already out I decided to give it a try anyway.\\n\\n\r\nThe series opened in a style of berserk and some other anime giving you a hint of what's to come. While risky I understand why they did it. Creators wanted you to know that it's going to be more than you expect and wanted you to keep attention. Other than that the start did all the things you would expect from the first few episodes, introducing you to this fantasy world where humans have driven themselves to extinction and only a bunch of mostly animalistic fantasy races remained living up in the sky islands in a relative safety from the terrors that lurked on the surface. I'm not going to go through the plot any more than that. Will only add that throughout the entirety of the series up to the last minutes of the last episode I had that sense of uneasiness that things are building up to something big and you will most likely experience that feeling too~\\n\\n\r\nWhat I will talk about though is our two main protagonists:\\n\r\nWillem- the only survivor of now hated human race that went extinct more than 500years ago, a shell of his former self who lost everything and everyone living in a place where being disfeatured (having no fur and/or fangs, wings etc..) can lead to racial discrimination. A character that isn't your standard tortured past overpowered protagonist, but an actual adult who also acts like one, a hero of a past now sidelined, scarred, weak, lonely..\\n\r\nChtolly (Kutori)- chances are high that slowly but surely you'll fall in love with her. On a surface she might seem a bit like a \"lightweight\" tsundere character without those annoying extremes.. In reality just a 15 year old who's everyday soft smile hide things and emotions that would easily break the toughest of us. Accepting your fate as terrible or painful it could be is one of the main themes in this story and Kutori is who you will root for till the very end of the series. Huge props to the voice actress of Kutori \\n\r\nTadokoro Azusa for giving the character so much depth.\\n\\n\r\nPacing. Slow, except towards the end.. But that's also the point (it's a story and character driven anime). And that's why it's so good. And that's why it's not for everyone.\\n\r\nAnimation. Nothing very special. Creature and beast designs may look a bit wacky at times but they still work. It's noticeably good at the start, in the middle and at the end of the series. And it's always good when it wants to accentuate something important.\\n\r\nSoundtrack. Opening and ending songs are nothing special but still good. Other than that the soundtrack is great. Funny enough most of the time you barely notice it because of how calm and low paced everything seems, well except for the emotional moments where it strongly supports what is happening on the screen. Also Scarborough fair is what a lot of people will remember about the music in this anime.\\n\\n\r\n3 episodes in it hit me how good the writing was and reminded me why I only binge-watched anime in the first place, waiting sucks.. so so so so so much.. It also wasn't hard to guess that the source material was a light novel cause it was way more story and character driven than manga based or original anime adaptations. So I started reading the novels more or less at the pace of the anime as it was airing and just wow.. it brought the story and characters that I liked a lot already to another level.\\n\\n\r\nSo if you're not against reading the novels I'd suggest watching till the end of episode 9 and then catching up with novels till you're at more or less the same place in the story as the anime. Than watch episodes 10-12 and continue where you were at in the light novels. Or just watch an entirety of the series first and than go for novels, though I would still recommend starting from vol1. It's a great read and it will add so  much more to the characters and the story.\\n\r\nWhat I don't recommend is reading the light novel first, as most know the source material is almost always better and this is no exception. That said the anime is still amazing.\\n\\n\r\nAnd because of the writing, my own experiences with it and how underrated it is. It's an easy 10/10 from me~\\n",

            "content": "When people rail against, lolis, cliches and overused tropes in anime, it is this kind of anime they are talking about.  There is nothing original or unique about this anime, other than it's ridiculously long title, which I refuse to retype.  The premise is familiar and has been seen a thousand times before.  \"Adorable lolis living a tragic existence are used by the government system to fight off a threat to humanity.  They are not seen as people and don't value their lives until the handsome stranger with a mysterious and equally tragic past emerges to show them a different path.\"This anime uses the exact same path as every other anime you've seen before of this kind.  \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are no different, either.  They are all cliched and do the same things as you've seen a thousand times before.  The Mysterious main character who acts as a father figure/lover (Willem), the Tsundere #1 girl who struggles with her feelings for the MC (Chtholly), the quiet white haired girl who is stoic and reliable (Nethren), the mischievous busy-body girl who acts like a tomboy (Illtihia).  The kindly matron character who really watches over all the kids (NyNy) It's all there. Nothing new. \\n\\n\r\nSo, why the high score?  \\n\\n\r\nBecause even though almost every trope is overused, the execution of them was done well.  They did a good job of making you like all the lolis, and making you feel concern for them via their cuteness.  The pacing was done well.  And with the exception of a lull in the later episodes, you never really feel bored with the anime. There's also an air of mystery to it, as it strings you along to find out why the world is the way that it is.  I think they expect to have a second season, because they didn't fully flesh out everything that happened in the past.  In addition, for an anime full of lolis they didn't go too hard on the moe.  This is still very much an action-adventure anime, with some pretty good action in it and even a little gore.     \\n\\n\r\nBut, the main reason it gets a higher score from me is the final episode.  The final episode was great.  It really made watching the anime worth it.  Without such a great finish, I probably would've rated this about a 6.  Because while it was good, it was still a worn out premise.  But, that final episode has you walking away feeling like \"Wow.\".  It made the whole experience well worth it.  \\n\\n\r\nThere were other flaws other than its overused premise, however.  As I alluded to, there's a lot that isn't explained about the past of this world or the characters.  It's more an overview than a detailed explanation.   \"What are braves exactly?\", \"Why did Humanity do what it did? What was the motivation?\", \"What was the Great Sage's involvement?\".  There are many other unanswered questions that I won't bring up so as not to spoil it.   \\n\\n\r\nAlso, the supporting cast felt pretty empty as well.  They relied more on \"moe\" than character depth.  They play with your emotional heart strings, more than engage your mental ones when it comes to the cast.  But, they know what they're doing because you can't help but care about likable lolis.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you are just really sick of the lolis, I wouldn't recommend this anime.  There's no guarantee you'll enjoy it like I did, or find the ending to be as great as I did.  But, if you think you have one more \"tragic loli\" anime you can deal with, I'd recommend it.  This is one that's worth sitting through.   \\n\\n\r\nStory: 6\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nOverall: 8",

Looking down on someone's decision or making it for them is nothing but selfishness.\r\nSeriously I can't even remember the title in its full name...\r\nAnyway SukaSuka is basically that anime that focuses alot in character progression, slice of life and romance. If you come here hoping for some intense action, then you are at the wrong spot. But if you enjoy things like value-ing live and romance this anime is for you.\r\nStory\r\nIt started with random encounter at a market between Willem and Chtholly, that already makes you curious on what to happen next, however in most ofthe late episode the plot is starting to become visible, and most of the time it is rushed with many missing logical links and it reduces the overall excitement in the story. but overall great story 8/10\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nArt is subjective you know? But for me i think the artist puts lots of efforts in designing the landscape and even the character that catches many people eyes so 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nSeriously one of the best audio experience that i have ever enjoyed in my entire life, all the ost are in sync with the story, and it successfully give us an image of how are the condition and emotion during the song. Furthermore after reading most of the lyrics, all of these songs have a very deep meaning that i really appreciate. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nI think this is the kind of anime that revolves only few characters even though there are many potential character that can contribute a lot to the plot, but sadly only get around 2-3 episode of on air which is a bit of a shame. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nThis particular series has taken me to many different emotion dimension and situation that makes me smile by myself sometimes, and it also can touch my emotion really hard that i still get a goose bump until now, that really adds on to the enjoyment of the overall anime 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is the kind of anime that i wishes for, that can play with my emotion through its plot and amazing soundtrack. If only there are more episode that can explain more about the characters it could be perfect. overall its 8.4/10",

            "content": "(SPOILERS READER BEWARE)\r\nWorld End is a great show with an organic romance.   That being said, it suffers from many different issues on many fronts that must be overlooked to get to the root of this experience.\r\nThe romance and character development of most of its main cast but it suffers from pacing and issues with characters that are caused by this anime's 12 episodes run time.  The main cast of young children in the orphanage are decent supporting characters but the most important one, being Tiat, receives enough screen time to seem important but is not made relevant enough to the plot eventhough it seems she would become the main heroine in the light novel.  In addition, I feel like the show would have benefited from an extra couple episodes to flesh out Nephren although it was enough to make me care about her, so the show did its job there. Most of the shows obviously was put toward making the romance between chtholly and Willem unfold as naturally as possible and fleshing out these two characters to endear us to them.  This I believe is the strongest portion of the show and the reason why you should watch it.  The drama was enough to make me ugly cry at the end and it made me feel deeply invested in these two characters (This is just me might affect others differently).  The romance was paced well and made sense even though it seemed doomed to fail eventually because of chtholly's seemingly inevitable memory loss.\\n\r\nNow to move on to the weaker parts of the show.  The artwork seemed basic and a little bland.  It might have just been the tv I was watching the show on.  Also, I disliked the animation cuts during any battle scenes. they were not bad per se because this show is not about the fights, that being said, the choreography was poor and unrealistic. (a couple of the battle scenes did look good this is just a general statement.  The music was not memorable for me although this is probably just because I have a hard time remembering the music from any show or movie I watch.  Now away from the more minor stuff and on to my main problem with this show.  The pacing is not amazing.  It feels like certain events such as chtholly's memory happen either too quickly or too slowly and, the whole arc where Willem helps the dog lady in the town felt arbitrarily long and unimportant.  Not much character development happened and the only important things that were established was the beginning of the weird scenes where Chtholly loses her memory\u2019s and too make a point and show how closely chtholly is watching Willem.  Both of which could be put almost anywhere.  Also, the whole thing where Willem meets Suoung and learns about the nature of the fairies/ leprechauns seemed a little too long.  It could have been a little shorter maybe to allow for more development of the main cast, but I do not think I should be removed completely because of the foreshadowing of the beasts being human, the fairy\u2019s origin, and establishing how the islands work.  To be honest, my main problem is not this short arc about Soong\u2019s length, its where it is placed.  It was jarring how Willem leaves the everyone behind in the middle of the episode.  It just seemed uncharacteristic of both people.  It would have made a lot more sense for Suong to meet Willem at the Fairy Warehouse or to simply have Willem know Suong from the start and have that be how received the job at the fairy warehouse.  Overall this scene was just mediocre, but it was a good example of pacing problems, so I wanted to go into it in a bit of detail.\\n\r\nIn the end this show set out to craft a love story and in it succeeded spectacularly in that sense.  World End, even with its many problems, works well and I believe it could have been much more popular and accepted in its anime form than it is with a bit more time and money.  Thankfully I am pretty sure that the light novel did really well in America. In conclusion this show is worth your time if you want to watch a tragic love story.  This has been one of the only pieces of media to make me ugly cry, so it will hold a special place in my heart for a long time.  From what I hear, the light novel fixes most of the pacing and world building problems that the anime adaptation falters on so I will have to read it to see the comparison between the two for myself.  That's about all I have to say about this show without watching the show for a second time and really getting down and dissecting individual scenes which I may end up doing for fun on a blog or YouTube channel.  Thanks for reading my review and have a nice day.  ( 10 because of its emotional impact if I\u2019m being objective the score would be lower)\\n",

And the story pace, in my opinion, is normal at first then gradually advances with different events and suddenly you'll realize you're in the last episode with the main event. The story advances sometimes with the main event and sometimes with side story which all goes well together.\r\nArt - The animation is good too. There weren't many flaws in animation quality in my opinion. The small details were really showed very nicely. EvenCotholy's single hair's color change was really eye-catching.\\n\\n\r\nSound - I have no complaints about the sound quality of the anime. The contribution in the sound department was really great. The background music was really put together well. And also the background soundtrack. The opening song in the first episode was perfect.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - The characters were nice too except sometimes. The MC was good (7) and the main heroine's character was also good. When she cried like a baby in MC's arm, that was unique. All the other characters were nicely put together.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would say it was really good, a unique and weird story. Sometimes it was annoying and sometimes good. I would have given 8/10 if there weren't weird stuff. It sure deserves an 8 or 9 except a few things.",

            "content": "It's to note that the none out of the apocalypse setting, western late modern period setting, warped isekai-ish setting, and their combination is particularly original. Now I might sound like a snob who thinks every fucking show should be 'original' and shouldn't be 'generic' and 'derivative' but you can look at my list and you'll know you'll be mistaken- that and my next point, which is that...\r\nYou can still make such an amazing show out of those settings if you push the right buttons. I think they did. Or at least was close to doing that. You can't really go THAT wrong with this kindof plot, right? And it's more dynamic and expansive than, say, Yuuki Yuuna for instance. And we have pretty good characters with fairly interesting backstories, too. Not to mention waifu-worthy girls, talking skeletons and adorable animals. The protagonists are likeable, not instant classics but not too middle-of-the-road, cool as you like. Art wasn't outstanding but good enough.\\n\\n\r\nAnd yet I can't renege the feeling that every moment I watched this I was, what's the word, well, not disappointed, underwhelmed? You get to feel these kinds of thoughts to varying degrees. This scene should have been more dramatic. This scene should have been more subdued. Willem should have been more expressive there. Willem should have acted cooler there. This scene needs a little less comedy. This scene should have played a bit slower. Those scenes should have been spaced out a bit. These scenes would have been better if contrasted. This episode is a bit cluttered and should have been sequenced a bit differently. This foreshadowing is clumsy. The visuals should have been more striking there. This moment should have been AMAZING! It really should have. Yet it isn't. Not really.\\n\\n\r\nEven in the last episode- those scenes, they should have been massive, yet they were just good~great level for me, as when I thought about the scenes again they lost their gloss a bit. In a nutshell, it's not scripted that well. I think.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not half saying that it's bad, but compare it to, say, Kakegurui that just finished as I write. It's pretty repetitive, and much of the characters are an acquired taste. I really don't think it had that much potential, I don't think it's half as good a show as Sukasuka is(at least the part adapted so far), in my opinion. Yet when you watch it you don't think of the above issues, since it's pretty gripping and immediate, adequately dramatic and paced pretty well. Hope you understand what I'm getting at. I really feel this problem masks a lot of the high points.\\n\\n\r\nSo, we have an anime with a not-particularly-original-but-adequately-quirky setting(genre), interesting (but slightly messy) storylines(songwriting), solidly likeable characters(catchiness), fairly enjoyable visuals(vocals), but with really boring direction(production); exacerbated in this case; that is reasonably, but not really very, popular. I proclaim Sukasuka as the anime version of Grizzly Bear. Sorry if I look like an idiot, which I probably do now.\\n\\n\r\nI now read the first sentences of the upvoted reviews on MAL and it looks like they echo my views somewhat; it looks like a fair amount of people thought the same.",

The pace starts slowly with character backstory and world secrets revealed piece by piece. But there is a catch. The story starts with main focus on male MC, but in mid series it shifts slowly but surely onto the main heroine. The shift is so subtle that it may trick some into believing that this whole series is about the male MC. Which makes people thinkthis is just a generic show with incomplete ending.\\n\\n\r\nBut no, this is NOT about the MC. This is about the main heroine.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nBeautiful city and sky background. Cool airship 3d. Subtle 'hollow' effects on heroine eyes. Creepy graphic and text during 'corruption' scene. And most importantly, that massage scene thou.\\n\r\nAlso, there are very few battle scenes here since the battle is not the main focus of the show.

Heartwarming ending, while leaving a little bit for open interpretation. Truly a joyful ride.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nA romance-fantasy show, focusing on a single tragic heroine.

They added a lot more drama to the series so it would have a different atmosphere to the other series.\r\nArt:\r\nThe art in this anime is great especially in the scene where Willem is tunning the Dug Weapons. The art helps the drama tag in this series more visual.\r\nSound:\r\nThe Openings, Background Sounds, and Ending songs are good combination to show the sad side of the anime, Especially whenScarborough Fair was played when Chtholly is fighting the beast.  (I'm still can't get over that scene) T_T\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe characters are great combination like Willem and Chtholly, a boy who has lost everything and a girl who likes to live a normal life. For me this is the best character combination i've seen in my life.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThe enjoyment is not quite the feeling like\"I want to see the next episode as soon as possible\" because I feel crying everytime a new episode is release thinking that something bad will happen again, but I sure enjoyed the series even though I'm still crying.

This is the only anime that made me cry, I watched some sad anime too like Your Lie in April and Akame Ga Kill but I didn't feel any sadness in me but here come SukaSuka that just made me cry for weeks.\\n\\n\r\nHope you guys watch the series too but be prepare to cry hahhaha and also don't forget to buy the LN so the anime could have a season 2",

            "content": "This will be a fully spoiler-free review.\r\nSukaSuka has been one of the hardest anime to rate just because I really thought it could've been a masterpiece, but there are just somethings that make it harder to enjoy.\r\nThe story is beautiful at its core; the writing intrigued me from episode one and I am glad that it stuck to the essence of the plot. The beginning of episode 1 was a genius idea as it basically creates a framework for the story to build upon between the first and final episode. My main problem with the development of the story is the unclear approach to eachpart of the story as well as the odd pacing at some parts. I believe that the story had a lot of potential for great development, but it failed to explore the possibilities. \\n\\n\r\nArt is pretty normal except the characters' faces where it looks very hand drawn, which is a nice detail. The music is one of the best I've heard, period. I liked basically every lyrical song in the soundtrack and the way they convey emotions through the songs is done very subtly but powerful. The non-lyrical OST is just good enough to create enough sustaining atmosphere throughout the series. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I really enjoyed the series and I think that even though a lot of potential was lost, the story kept me interested from episode one and I leave wanting more and without much disappointment.",

Is its griping story, its amazing animation beautiful scenery, or the sound how they use the music, and other sound effects to fully engulf the watcher.\r\nIts probably a combination of everything.  This show is amazing.  I'd say the best part is how they mix it all together from the joyful moments to the tragic ones this show does great at pacing, and really grabbing a hold of the heart strings and strumming them to the beat of the plot \r\nThe worldis intriguing and well developed, and the show really lets characters shine you'll be invested in seeing how the characters develop and turn out.  I'll end this review saying  fantasy lovers this is one for you!",

Why? because the review score was low early on and suddenly raised at the end of season. It was because of the marvelous ending of this anime. 10/10 will cry. Rewatched the ending several time already. It really moved me.\r\nIts a post apocalyptic type of story, has balance male and female lead. fantasy and romance genre with some fighting scene in it. Slow development, but it build up to a single beautiful,moving ending. I'm going to rewatched the ending episode again.",

BUT the anime left so many thing unexplained and confused... Since is based on a light novel and there is no manga, if you are a curious person who wan'ts to undertand averything you'll be so sad, because it's really hard to find translated light novels...\r\nSo, story:7\r\nCharacter:6\r\nIs a post apocalyptic cliche. Good characters, but since the anime has 12 episodes I could use a little more development and explanation. But for a 12episodes anime, nothing much to complain, it did what it came here for, make me want to read the novel for continuation.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I'm in love with the opening and the soundrack for the anime is really well placed, I will not give a 9 or 10 because it wasn't THAT much of a soundrack, but well chosen for the anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Beautiful, look at these girls and their eyes, their wings, swords, really good. They worked hard on this one.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7. The need to know more and the lack of explanations made I enjoy it a little less. While watching it was an 8, but it dropped to 7 after the ending.(I want a second season)\\n\\n\r\nConcluding: If you like girls fighting, post apocalyptic scenario, mosters, good art and you can surpress your anger by not being able to discover more, watch it :) Hope my review is helpful :)",

It does tell only a small part of the world's history which seems to be interesting though. It's like going to and fro without hitting the center. I've just finished watching and still my head is full of unanswered questions. It there would be a continuation... \r\nHowever, the anime have a different purpose rather than telling a viewer about the world. I'd call it an emotional trip. And quite merciless one. It gives us just enough time to get a sympathy to characters and then comes a time fora whole bunch of drama and tragedy events. I have to admit the show is well directed, so those \"seams\" between ordinary casual events and action-packed drama ones are not so notable. I mean, in general it's quite smooth, maybe just a little bit edgy around the corners. \\n\r\nIf you're into emotion-driven story, you might like this one. From the very opening seconds of the show you would know what to expect. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation is simply great. And deserves praise in every aspect. Fighting scenes are delicious, even everyday scenes are pleasant to watch. Every girl character is extremely cute. Also, the way they express their emotions is very expressive. Few scenes are great solely because there're no words in them. Only glances, blushings. \\n\\n\r\nI liked the op. Another OST-s are nice to listen to. I want to highlight the ones in the end. Gosh, they were awesome. In combination with visual part it gave me some shivers. They did very good job creating a proper mood. \\n\\n\r\nMoe, more moe! What can be said more about characters? I'd not say there are some unique ones here. Or even interesting ones. At any rate, you'll sympathy with them, believe me. Maybe, exactly because they're so simple and straightforward. Hm, I wanna make an excuse about interesting characters... Probably, Willem is quite interesting thanks to his backstory. But did we get a lot intel about it? No. Beats me. Not taking into account his backstory, he's... a kind guy. \\n\r\nHowever, their personalities don't matter as much as their interactions. That's the gem of the show. Willem and Ctholly. \\n\\n\r\nI did enjoy it. Returning, to my first sentence I'm uncertain... The end. The end creates a dozen of questions and I didn't like the last 10 or so seconds of the show. It's absurd. \\n\r\nThe show doesn't have a real \"point\", there's no real ending here. So, perhaps, a continuation might solve this. \\n\\n\r\nIf you're searching for a beautiful love story with great animation - here you go.",

Let me explain.\r\nShuumatsu Nani Shitema... SukaSuka, for short (and my mental stability) is  an anime produced based on a Light Novel. \r\nWell, fair enough. \r\nNow, i haven't read the LN, BUT! I could bet my house that the LN is better. (On MAL, it's rated 8.69, So I win).\r\nBut let's start saying something about this anime:\r\nThe story is quite enjoyable, i didn't dislike it but i cannot say that i properly liked it. I \"appreciate\" it? Can I say that? \r\nIt's linear andafter all, not a bad story at all. But... i don't know, it has its \\n\r\ninconsistencies... I cannot go any further, or i could make spoilers BUT! What happened before? Who created all this? Why he's alive? Answers! \\n\r\nNo, authors didn't want let us know. In the sequel, maybe? Hope is our weapon, but for now, story is a 6. \\n\\n\r\nArt and drawings were ok, i guess. Normal. \\n\r\nSounds follow.\\n\\n\r\nOh, NOW! We can talk: Characters! Yes! YES! \\n\r\nMediocre. ALL THE WAY. I want answers, guys! Why, at the end of the season, i'm with more questions than answers? Couldn't you add some more answers? \\n\r\nI didn't understand many things. \"Yea, but there's a LN out there, go read that\". No. Why am I forced to read the LN? I want answers in the anime. It's the holy bible with its interpretations and numerous versions? I must go in the past to know the answers? \\n\r\nApparently, it seems so. Well, I'll wait the sequel, hoping that there will be something more juicy. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, of course, has suffered. I Enjoyed the final episodes. More action, more things, people explaining things, people doing something different from useless things like dating (wtf) and going to search a father of a dog girl (where she go? Disappeared. Puff. No more dog girl for you!)\\n\\n\r\nSo, I give a 6 (a 7, on trust), waiting for a sequel that could give me more answers.",

            "content": "Alright, a warning: this review will involve minor spoilers, if you want to go in fresh, then I would stop reading this now, but I would argue that this spoiler will help you have a better idea of what you're getting into and will probably help you enjoy it if you choose to watch.\r\nTL;DR Shuumatsu is an anime that tries to do a few things at once and doesn't quite succeed at any of it. While none of the elements are critical failures at an objective level, they contradict each other and create problems. If you are looking for a fluffy show with bright coloursand a happy story then you will be disappointed. If you are looking for a more action oriented fantasy about struggle then you will be disappointed. If you are looking for a full tragedy then you will be disappointed. I think the best chance one has of enjoying this is to only be in the moment with this show. Ignore the artwork, ignore what other people say what it's about, ignore your expectations and just accept it moment by moment. If you can accomplish that, then you can enjoy this. I think that's how other people did.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't.\\n\\n\r\nFrom here on are spoilers. Proceed at your own risk.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWe get our set up: Willem, the male protagonist, is a lone survivor of the human race in a distant post-apocalyptic fantasy setting. While humans are long extinct and the surface of the world inhabited by apocalyptic doom monsters, the world is still inhabited by beast-races and fantasy races that live on flying islands above the surface. Unfortunately, doom monsters still rise from the surface to attack the islands. To defend themselves, the beast races must use the legendary swords left behind by the Brave Heroes of the human race and the ONLY ones who can wield these swords are young girls called leprechauns which are kept by the military as living weapons. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOh, and the girls finish off the monsters by blowing themselves up using the swords.\\n\\n\r\nYeah.\\n\\n\r\n Willem then becomes these girls' caretaker and what follows is a sombre story filled with pops of daily life and harsh battles as we get to know the girls and one by one come to lose them...\\n\\n\r\n...is what you'd think. Instead what we get is a slice of life story. Willem takes care of the younger girls, supports the older girls, cleans, bakes and gets flirted with by the oldest leprechaun and female lead, Ctholly. He also tunes the swords properly. As it turns out he is actually one of the Brave Heroes that used the legendary swords in the past and thus knows how to use them without destroying the wielder. He teaches the girls how to use them as well as fight and the story turns into one of triumph over the odds, peppered with slice of life moments...\\n\\n\r\n...is what you'd think. Instead, we get both of those. Sort of. The result is both bizarre and largely unsatisfying. We get long scenes and stretches of multiple episodes with characters baking and cleaning happily, punctuated by battles that take place either entirely offscreen or only appear for 30 seconds at a time. However, the build up to these battles paints them as though they were major conflicts that would define the series, creating disappointment when one actually gets to them and they are both short and have no lasting impact. The series drips in tragic foreshadowing and time and again it seems as if we're going to to lose one of the characters either to battle, accident, side effect of military maintenance, or degradation of the mind. Yet each time, everyone comes out fine. Not just fine, but perfectly healthy and happy. This happens repeatedly throughout the show: They'll foreshadow a loss or tragedy and constantly have the characters be completely uninhibited. After a time, all the tension loses its charm. Yet, at the same time it keeps the dread in the background so enjoying the slice of life scenes to their fullest becomes tainted. \\n\\n\r\nIn short, it's a show that keeps promising that if you just watch a liiiiiittle more, something big is going to happen, and then it almost never does. This is compounded by the fact that when serious situations occur, people don't treat them as they should. Willem has a complex about saving people. At the same time, another character is - without going into too many details - struck ill. There is a ticking clock counting down on the character until the illness progresses so much that the character is destroyed. There is one item that Willem thinks of that can halt this process. He figures out where it is but instead of he and the character attempting to get it as soon as possible, they encounter a roadblock...and then they all proceed to wait patiently for the roadblock to pass and have a cute Christmas celebration. \\n\\n\r\nThat's it. \\n\\n\r\nNo one attempts to think of another solution. No one really chomps at the bit. Nothing. It gives the audience a mixed message: Is this a big deal or not? It becomes hard to tell, which means it becomes hard to engage with the major events of the plot. This happens repeatedly and then compounds until, by the time episode 12 rolls around and things DO become tragic, any investment in the show has a good chance of being long since evaporated. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, in terms of pacing, the entire thing feels chaotic, with cute scenes of baking, cleaning or ecchi massages coming during tense build ups to life and death situations. As I said, the effect is bizarre. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOf course, your mileage will vary.\\n\\n\r\nStory gets a 3/10. The elements are THERE to make it good but they are put together so chaotically that all of the shows themes and powerful elements end up muted and confused. Sometimes even agitating.\\n\\n\r\nArt gets a 7/10. It was pretty, but not in any fashion that set it apart from most modern bright shows.\\n\\n\r\nSound gets a 7/10. The music often fades into the background but can sometimes enhance a scene very well. The use of Scarborough Fair is excellent both times it is used and the OP is not my cup of tea for the most part. Oddly enough, the OP is a good summary of the show: For the most part it is this J-Poppy song but for a brief period it just ROCKS OUT which is kinda like how the show has a tiny bursts of action floating in this endless soup of other stuff.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters gets a 6/10. Over the course of the show I felt that they had the bones of good characters but I only felt I got to know them in the latter parts of episode 12, and by then it was far too late. I feel that if more time had been spent on diving into the characters, their pasts and their actions rather than the slice of life stuff earlier, then the characters would have been better realized. Unfortunately, this was not the case.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment gets a 1/10. This show made me very salty (yeah, I know) and I was agitated for most of the time I watched it passed a certain point. Essentially nothing happened for the longest period of time. That was the problem. It kept hinting that something would happen, only for the story to continue plodding along with no urgency or changes. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 4/10. It had good moments and good ideas, but put together in such a fashion that only served to weaken them.\\n\\n\r\nAnd there's Shuumatsu. It had the makings of a great tragedy. It had the makings of an post-apocalyptic action fantasy. It had the makings of a sweet romance and it had the makings of a cute slice of life. However, by doing all of these elements at once and put together so chaotically? I found it weakened them all.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, if you stick to it and ignore ANY expectations you have and just enjoy it by a scene by scene basis until you get to the end? You might have a good time.\\n\\n\r\n I didn't, but I hope you do. \\n\\n",

            "content": "If you haven't seen this anime, and you like romance, fantasy, steampunk, well developed and written characters, action, and stunning animation, and you haven't seen this show, then you need to watch it ASAP.\r\nThe story is about a human soldier who fought in a mysterious war against the gods 500 years before the series started, only to be frozen in ice and awoken centuries later to a world in which humanity has died out and been replaced by fairies, trolls, and animal people. Our hero Willem is placed in charge of biological weapons called Leprechauns, who are girls made using necromancy to wield weapons thatallow them to fight the monsters that ravage the world's surface.\\n\r\nAs far as lead characters go, Willem is an exceptionally well written anime protagonist, being wracked by survivor's guilt and a host of mental insecurities from his time in the war, and having countless flaws where his principals prevent him from doing the morally right thing in spite of his better judgement. He feels lie a real, conflicted human who has been through hell and is just trying to find happiness. The same can be said for Ctholly, the main heroine who is a leprechaun undergoing \\n\r\na gradual loss of her memories for reasons I can't spoil. Ctholly is a fascinating character whose struggle to retain her personality and identity leads to the viewer completely understanding and empathising with her right to the end of the story. I don\u2019t think I have ever felt as emotionally invested in the main characters of an anime before as I have with these two, and watching them grow as people and gradually organically fall in love as the story progresses more than makes up for the show\u2019s slow pacing (though there are instances where that does drag a bit).\\n\r\nWord of warning: the show is a somewhat Shakespearian tragedy, winding towards an epic but emotionally devastating conclusion that I was utterly unprepared for.\\n\r\nThe show\u2019s biggest problems are its pacing and its somewhat varying tone. The slow-pace and inconsistent stakes between episodes makes it quite boring and frustrating to watch during the first seven-ish episodes, and the failed attempts at comedy and (very occasionally) fanservice detract from the otherwise serious and emotionally driven plot. To talk about any of the other issues I have with the show would be to spoil major plot details, and I don\u2019t want to do that because you need to experience this show for yourself. \\n\r\nThe animation however is superb, particularly regarding the action sequences in the later part of the series and the CGI used for metal surfaces on the airships, all of which were stunningly designed with Last Exile-level intricacy.\\n\r\nIn short, the show has excellent world-building, relatable and fascinating characters, stunning visual presentation, superb action sequences, a beautiful soundtrack, and was just excellent at drawing me in and getting me invested in its protagonists. It doesn\u2019t start off great, but if you stick with it, it will reward you with one of the greatest action romance stories ever put to television, period, let alone anime and it\u2019s one of the best anime I have ever seen. 9/10, highly recommended.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Overall Rating: 7.7/10\r\nStory: B-\r\nAnimation: A-\r\nMusic & Sounds: B+\r\nCharacters: A-\r\nEnjoyment: A- \r\nOverall:\r\nWell I don't want to take much of your time so I'll not leave a lengthy review.\r\nSo the surprising thing about this anime is it's name actually, I'm serious like just take a look at it \u201cWorldEnd: What do you do at the end of the world? Are you busy? Will you save us?\u201d.So it's a fantasy, drama, sci-fi and mainly a post apocalyptic romance anime. At the start of the series the word has already ended, well the surface actually but now there are floating islands in the sky which carries the remaining population.However that population is not of Humans rather it's of humanoid animals like lizards, dogs, cats etc. The humans\u2026 Are they alive? Or are they dead? That's something you\u2019ll know once you watch it.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nSo the anime is a post apocalyptic romance anime and the first half of the anime focuses mainly on the relationship building of the couple and I have one or two grievance with the production about how they did their relationship build up and the extra characters were given due coverage but Ithea and Ren should've been given some more coverage. As I said that it's a post apocalyptic romance anime so it also covers some action, mystery as well but they weren't done well or I would say they didn't had it as a primary focus so they went a little downhill on these areas whereas I think proper focus on these places would've in my opinion elevated this anime a lot. Well there are a few more grievances of mine but I think the simple thing which answers my questions is that the anime is 12 episodes where as the light novel has 5 volumes so that's why I'll end up reading the light novel as well as the manga.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation:\\n\\n\r\nSo the art style was not really good in my opinion though they are following the manga/novel art style as usual but I really think they should let go of these restrictions and really make realistic art as possible and the animation was actually better compared to art though only a few problems I was able to spot.\\n\\n\r\nMusic & Sounds:\\n\\n\r\nSo every VA did a good job in my opinion and about the opening themes, I really didn't feel them much. They were good but not really my type and I know they could have choose a better song or either even perfected the ones they used though they ending themes are all that I really like and enjoy and the OST list has great tracks but I think they miss a few on action scenes as they didn't had a good OST for action scenes. About the timing, I have this grievance with almost all anime as not a single anime has been perfect itiming and all.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nSo I think the extra characters of Ren and Ithea should have been given more coverage as they could have helped the series to be more enjoyable and also to have a better understanding of the relationship build up of Ren and others and Ithea and others. And the other two fairies were a surprise and also why were they included in the first place? But anyway that's something to go look in the source material for. About Chtholly and Willem, well the production did a good job with them.\\n\r\nThis story did not focus much on the enemy side as they're all mindless monsters but I was hoping for a central character figure but anyways.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: \\n\\n\r\nWell it's definitely not a gem and but a decent series to enjoy binge-watching at your weekend.",

            "content": "Shuumatsu Nani Shite.... SukaSuka.\r\nSukaSuka could be called one of spring 2017's dark horse shows, and it's mostly due to its' well done execution.\r\nI've not read the LN so I'm unaware of future events.\r\nStory: 9\r\nThe story this show tells could be seen as quite generic in a way. We have our clear MC together with a bunch of young \"supergirls\" who defend their  world against monsters who wiped out humanity. In this sense, it's quite similar to shows like Owari no Seraph.\r\nWhat makes this stand out is the mean pacing and relentlesness of the events, trying to make the viewer sit on edge while watching,in other words peaking our interests. It's worth to note that we have yet to have had any real-time casualties so far, but there are many deathflags around a few characters.\\n\r\nWe also learn our characters' powers and their limits, as well as their personalities and glimpses at their backstories in a fluid way, which tells me that the author knew what he was doing and it was adapted very well.\\n\r\nIt looks as if this anime will have 12 episodes according to a reddit post, so the plot will definitely start speeding up soon, however I am a bit worried about what potential it can reach with only 12 episodes and this plot.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 7\\n\r\nThis is probably the weakest part of this show. both the base quality of the art as well as the adapted animation to it are \"outdated\", and by that I mean: The character art is pretty similar to how characters looked 10 years back in anime, and the studio adapting it did not improve much from how it would really have looked if it was done 10 years ago.\\n\r\nThe animal-human extras look quite awful for the most part, which is a shame.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nBoth the OP/ED are quite decent, a variety of OSTs, and the OSTs also play at the correct moments, which is a big plus for effect.\\n\r\nVoice acting is good, sound effects are all good so far, e.g. the sword swings in ep3 actually sounds like \"we want them to\" unlike... Berserk2016+17.\\n\r\nOverall it's solid sound quality, but it's not exceptional.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nAnother strong part of this show just like with the story - the characters.\\n\r\nThe characters often makes a show rise or drop, since they are directly connected to how far you can go with the story, and also decides how well you can understand the plot.\\n\r\nA few characters of note:\\n\r\nMC - Willem: A man who once lost everything as well as almost his own life, brought back to life after being found in a deep frozen state. We know that he can use the talisman weapons and superpowers and also that he was fighting to save the world, but now after being revived he pays the blood price for using his powers.\\n\r\nThe rest of the main cast are quite hard to describe, at the current stage of the show we've yet to see all characters or any real antagonist other than \"the monsters\".\\n\r\nExtras + Sidestory?: Man/animal citizens - this is what drags the 10 off from the character department, they're just TOO dull and the design too bland to match the rest of the quality characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nAs I mentioned previously, this show keeps you interested while watching. It has excellent cliffhangers so far so you feel urged to watch the next episode.\\n\r\nThe only problem I have with it are the extra characters as well as art/animation quality - to say the least, i'm even surprised I picked the series up after having watched the front page picture.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nA solid way to waste your time! Could recommend to most people.\\n\r\nWill update this review in the future.\\n\r\nOverall score is does not represent the rankings of its' individual attributes, This is the score I think this show can reach on MAL as well as for me personally if the continuing episodes are as good as the previous ones.",

There are some developments during the work, which greatly changes its way.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I found it quite acceptable, not very detailed, but a consonant animation.\\n\\n\r\nExploration of the Universe: it is well presenting, showing the floating islands, how people live, a little earth after annihilation, shows the place that mc stays with the girls. But nothing too deep.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack: normal, only in the parts of drama he is well above average.\\n\\n\r\nFinal: I expected a lot and I was disappointed, very rushando with a great excess of drama, a very sad end, I had to look for information about what happened later.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal opinion: I recommend this anime for people who love a romance with drama, but a lot of drama, with a post apocalyptic universe, in a fantasy world.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPortugu\u00eas:\\n\\n\r\nHist\u00f3ria: \u00e9 um anime com uma historia interessante, o mundo foi atacado por monstros e os humanos foram quase extintos, os que sobraram deixaram a superf\u00edcie e foram morar numa ilha flutuante, o nosso mc \u00e9 \u00fanico sobrevivente da ra\u00e7a humana, e tinha sido congelado 500 anos atras acorda.

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nThe older I get, the more I become aware of my own mortality.\r\nA rather sad opener, right? It is, and it isn\u2019t. When I was kid, I had no concept of death and what that meant. I wasn\u2019t thinking about whether I\u2019d make it to tomorrow but instead about how many hours of video games I\u2019d be able to squeeze in-between homework and dinner.\r\nHowever, with age comes maturity \u2013 and the realization that I will not be around here forever. That thought scares me; I want to see everything that life has to offer. ButI won\u2019t. I know that, and that\u2019s the sad part.\\n\\n\r\nYet, in a paradoxical manner, that\u2019s also the uplifting part. My time is short, so I know that I must do what I can now to make the most of it. From enjoying the moments with my loving family to fighting hard at making writing a potential career, I believe I\u2019m doing just that. There\u2019s still a lot left to get to, but that thought simply makes me more motivated than ever before.\\n\\n\r\nShuumatsu Nani Shitemasu ka? Isogashii desu ka? Sukutte Moratte Ii desu ka? (which will hence be SukaSuka from here on out because jeez laweez) thinks about these same thoughts, too. And while this entire project may not reach the pinnacle of storytelling, what it has to say is still worth hearing out.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nOn a day like any other, a blue-haired girl named Chtholly crosses paths with a man named Willem in the streets of a city that rests atop a floating chunk of land. They spend the day together as newfound acquaintances but must eventually part ways \u2013 only for him to coincidentally become the caretaker of a warehouse that houses her, other girls of a similar or younger age, and a bunch of top-secret \u201cweapons.\u201d When Willem learns that those weapons are the very same girls he now looks after, SukaSuka finally gets its core underway.\\n\\n\r\nAt its core, the anime explores two major themes: the inevitability of death and the pursuit of happiness.\\n\\n\r\nRather profound ideas to say the least. But that\u2019s SukaSuka. Wrapped up in this science-fiction-fantasy landscape, a microcosm forms around Chtholly, Willem, and the lives they experience, presenting to the audience a world both simultaneously too large to comprehend and too small to ignore.\\n\\n\r\nFor most people, death isn\u2019t always on the mind. They think of it is as something far and away from the daily troubles of jobs, relationships, and hobbies. But it\u2019s there. It\u2019s inevitable. Death comes for everyone whether wanted or not. Interestingly, with SukaSuka, it not only devalues the lives of the fairies therein but also reduces the lifespans they carry. So, death isn\u2019t just inevitable \u2013 it\u2019s right around the corner. And Willem\u2019s petrification does not last forever; death will find him in the end too.\\n\\n\r\nFor most people, happiness is on the mind. In an indirect sense at least, for people always want happy emotions to replace the negative ones acquired from all over. They fail at those jobs. They break apart those relationships. They reach a roadblock in those hobbies. Once again, SukaSuka shows the same but to a greater degree. Chtholly\u2019s mental disintegration and Willem\u2019s unfair fate bully them throughout the entire season, making it really hard for them to defend themselves against the onslaught of negativity.\\n\\n\r\nThese two themes represent a duality within SukaSuka. Indeed, death and happiness interlink their existence within the show. After all, how can one be happy when death creeps ever closer? To the anime, it argues that one\u2019s personal end cannot earn control. Otherwise, there would be no point to doing anything. Chtholly understands this sentiment, saying as much during her musings while she takes down laundry or cooks that next meal for the night.\\n\\n\r\nTo put it differently, escaping death is a fool\u2019s errand for Chtholly, Willem, or even the audience watching this tale play out. Yet happiness is still something sought after and fought for. If the inevitability of death is a truth, then so is the fact that happiness comes in all shapes and sizes. As Rhantolk tells Chtholly, happiness is a feeling that cannot so easily be defined because it means something different to everyone.\\n\\n\r\nSuch happiness does not have to be an intimate, romantic relationship as seen here between Chtholly and Willem. It can be enjoying a winter festival with friends and loved ones. It can be marveling at the sights of a town featured in the many lizard-centric films available. It can even be a simple butter cake whose delectable fluffiness counts as a promise upheld. All that matters is finding and cherishing whatever that happiness may be. Because, yes, death is inevitable \u2013 but happiness makes that truth not worth worrying about in the slightest.\\n\\n\r\nTo reiterate, SukaSuka\u2019s themes here are pretty good. The trouble, however, comes from the rest of this story.\\n\\n\r\nFor starters, the show has a strange pacing problem. It often sticks itself in this weird state of not that fast but not that moderate, showing a little bit more than just enough to make the scenes relevant but not enough to give them the impact they require to bolster the plot. For instance, Chtholly sometimes mentions how its thanks to Willem\u2019s training that she survived her battle in which she was destined to die. But that \u201ctraining\u201d consisted of only a small minute-or-so scene that the anime never elaborated on or showcased beyond a few pieces of dialogue and a couple of swings of their swords.\\n\\n\r\nMany of the events are also quite anticlimactic. Simply put, a handful of SukaSuka\u2019s story beats do not punch hard enough when the plot divulges its content for one reason or another. For example, in episode ten, Willem comes to the \u201cstunning\u201d realization that the beasts are actually genetically deformed humans. Quotes used because the reveal is dampened by the lame nature of the connecting dots at hand and the mishandled delivery in shoving into the audience\u2019s faces a series of unnecessary mini-flashbacks to conversations heard literally minutes prior.\\n\\n\r\nWeird tonal issues exist, too. Sometimes as far into the season as episode ten. Therein, Chtholly\u2019s comedic bits and the crew\u2019s teasing of Willem don\u2019t have much of a place in the narrative. Not only because of the danger and the troubles they are experiencing but also because the audience knows the impending dramatic climax depicted in the very first episode at the very start of the season will arrive at any second.\\n\\n\r\nAnd weak writing in general hurts SukaSuka. Suwong and Eboncandle show up in episode six as big parts of Willem\u2019s past life, but they almost never reappear for the rest of the show\u2019s run afterwards. In episode eight, Chtholly\u2019s dramatic saving and Willem\u2019s subsequent crying fall flat since the little girl who falls off the tall post isn\u2019t one of the few girls that the anime took the time to highlight but rather some no-name kid. And it\u2019s super convenient that the ruins they investigate in the last section of the anime just-so-happen to be where Willem grew up.\\n\\n\r\nArguably, even the ending has problems to point out, for it\u2019s a bit too up-in-the-air. It isn\u2019t so much bittersweet as much as it seems just straight bitter since it seems like everyone \u201clost\u201d in the end regardless of their actions. At the minimum, the anime either drops plot points or doesn\u2019t clear up enough to make it a satisfactory conclusion. What happened to the sword that put them on their last lost cause to begin with? What about Grick? Willem? What does the rippling GPS water mean? And presuming that the absolute final scene is of Chtholly\u2019s reincarnation, how necessary of detail is it after everything that has happened?\\n\\n\r\nTaking all of these elements into consideration, SukaSuka clearly makes it awfully hard to say the writing around its important ideas does enough to support them. Even so, some items can be excused. The Seventeen Beasts threaten the world, and they continue to do so when the anime concludes, but they were merely a backdrop to this tale. While the whole gods-descended-to-kill-humans-to-stop-them-from-killing-their-world-and-thus-themselves angle is a bit absurd as an explanation on the show\u2019s part, it was never its intention to solve this thread outright.\\n\\n\r\nPlus, credit where credit is due. The anime does an okay job of creating a believable fantasy world. It visits different locations like the sky islands and the animal-people-filled cities. It uses terminology like \u201cemnetwhits\u201d (or \u201coriginal humans\u201d), \u201ccarillon\u201d (or \u201ctalisman weapon\u201d), and \u201cvenenum\u201d (or \u201cmagic energy\u201d). It explains some of its rules like the origins of the fairies themselves. This world-building comes mostly in the form of heavy exposition rather than weaving it seamlessly into the plot, but having it around for the setting is welcomed all the same.\\n\\n\r\nAnd SukaSuka also deserves points for its narrative construction. By showing the end at the start, and holding off at getting to that same scene until almost right at the end of the season itself, the anime more or less argues for a purposeful proverb: \u201cIt\u2019s not the destination that matters but the journey.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nAltogether, the anime does hamper the efficacy of its thematic exploration with a wide array of questionable choices. But those themes on inevitability and happiness are inherently strong. And, to be fair, the show then includes the occasional buffer to balance out some of those grievances anyway. So, all told, the story is left in a fine state that perhaps could have been better but could also have been way worse.\\n\\n\r\nART & ANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the art that SukaSuka boasts, it prides itself most on the designs of its characters, for they reach across a spectrum of details.\\n\\n\r\nLike Grick the goblin or Limeskin the lizard man, these designs can sometimes be fantastical in nature. Like the kids of the warehouse, they can sometimes be very colorful. Like Willem and Chtholly, they can be proper or cute (respectively) in their getups. More characters and thus more designs of course exist, but, with just this handful of examples, the anime makes it easy to spot and to understand the variance and the detail for these designs.\\n\\n\r\nVariance also appears during other parts of the season. Namely, the show includes the occasional spectacle to add some intrigue to the show\u2019s proceedings. At first thought ignored, the anime showcases Chtholly and the other girls\u2019 fight with the demonic beast in episode five. Their final charge during the final episode against the regenerating beasts, especially Chtholly\u2019s final stand. Willem\u2019s neat carillon tuning exercise with the light bubbles and floating pieces. Their sunset view overlooking the city where they first met. These moments are few and far between, but they give the show something cool (albeit at times sad) to watch.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of the background art also has its place. The faraway shots of the different islands. The greenery and shrubbery of the locations. The quaint depictions of the towns and their busyness. The warehouse where Willem and the others stayed with its rooms and details and lighting. Nothing too extravagant on SukaSuka\u2019s part, but this art can make the show pretty when it wants to.\\n\\n\r\nOtherwise, the anime doesn\u2019t have a lot of impact on a visual front. Cinematography remains mostly an afterthought, even having a couple of strange cuts or framed shots littered throughout the season. And actual animation never really sticks out. Since the style involved does not aim for intrigue, it falls on this movement to engage the audience, but the constant slow panning, rather unmoving, and simply plain shots turn many of the normal conversations and moments held between the characters into dull events.\\n\\n\r\nWith the art in general offsetting the boring cinematography and the lack of actual animation, the visuals come out fine for what they are and not much else.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nFor SukaSuka, only two characters truly matter: Chtholly and Willem.\\n\\n\r\nThese two \u201cdisfeatured\u201d people meet by happenstance, spending the day together getting lost in town, listening to music, and enjoying one another\u2019s company. At the end of the day, they must part, but not for long because Willem is assigned as caretaker to the very warehouse where Chtholly and many other girls (both big and small) reside.\\n\\n\r\nNow in the same relative space, they (alongside the audience) learn more about each other. Chtholly is just one of many fairies destined to open a Fairy Gate, defeating (part of) the enemy forces but costing her own life in the process. When not fighting on the front lines, she can be found looking after the other kids. In other words, she helps out as a mother of sorts around the warehouse as best she can. Her kindness and her acceptance continue to fit her in this role, too.\\n\\n\r\nWillem is somewhat similar. He is quiet and watchful, bonding with the older and younger girls alike through his different interests in cooking, reading, and learning. The first episode hints at the powers he himself keeps hidden, and, as events occur, his unique capabilities become more readily apparent even if they are not used all that often.\\n\\n\r\nThe first three episodes setup Chtholly and Willem in this manner. On a more interesting note, however, they also form their arcs. In particular, they follow the same themes that the story does: the inevitability of death and the pursuit of happiness.\\n\\n\r\nFor Chtholly, it\u2019s the inevitability of death. She starts to experience nightmarish visions and paradoxical whispers in her head that slowly degrade her mind and her memories. Yet a lot of the talking points around this development do not hold fast. She often refuses to talk about it with anybody, lying and pretending to prolong the drama in SukaSuka rather than allowing it to play out naturally. The classic \u201cIt\u2019s nothing\u2026\u201d response is particularly aggravating, especially when Willem would (presumably) do anything to help her feel better.\\n\\n\r\nBut she still seeks out and holds relationships with other members of the cast to give her existence a purpose beyond death. She talks with Limeskin over some tea about \u201cresolve and resignation.\u201d Her jealousy towards Nygglatho over her forward behavior with Willem rises in her new emotions she has never felt before. And her aside with Ithea \u2013 despite the sudden, ill-timed, and not-very-meaningful backstory \u2013 draws parallels to a sense of self that everybody, including Chtholly, requires.\\n\\n\r\nFor Willem, it\u2019s the pursuit of happiness. The anime tries to retroactively create his character through the use of several flashbacks. Unfortunately, these moments do not provide enough. He cares a lot about his previous life with his friends and family at the orphanage he used to stay at, but only one such miniscule scene is ever given. His time as a so-called \u201cbrave\u201d is hardly ever shown except for right before his petrification, so the audience doesn\u2019t actually see Willem in his prime. And just a tiny interaction with his former teammates that involves cookies comprises the majority of his regret. In short, Willem\u2019s character simply lacks context to make his feelings and his actions worthwhile.\\n\\n\r\nIronically, while Willem not having enough hurts his character, not doing enough helps instead. Near the end of the series, Willem remarks how he couldn\u2019t do anything to save Chtholly. That his efforts were futile and (in an out-of-body experience of sorts) just a selfish way for him to make amends for his previous failures. Even if he \u201cdid nothing\u201d the whole season, that\u2019s part of the point. Just being there for Chtholly during her own time of need was, in fact, more than enough for her.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless of the mixed writing that forms the foundation of Chtholly\u2019s and Willem\u2019s respective characters, their bond finds strength. While Willem massaging Chtholly to rid her of venenum poisoning marks the most direct and physical interaction between the two, much of their relationship builds from smaller, grounded scenes that grow them closer together. Him hugging her tightly after she returns from the battle in which she was meant to die. The butter cake scene. Him grabbing her hand while gazing at some shooting stars. Their shopping sequence as a \u201ccouple.\u201d Showing off her dress at the night of the festival. His proposal. Their kiss and final, minimal exchange. They do not technically have any standout scenes, but their relationship grows into something not just symbiotic or romantic but also interlinked. Exactly like those two constant themes.\\n\\n\r\nInterestingly, as the series nears the finale, those respective themes on inevitability and happiness flip between the two. Willem basically loses the home he had grown to love, forcing his inevitable fate back into that of fighting because (as he would perhaps put it) that\u2019s all he has. Chtholly, having now embraced death, declares herself as the happiest person anybody could ever possibly be regardless of what may happen now or in the future.\\n\\n\r\nGiven the ending and its ambiguity, it\u2019s tough to say whether Chtholly and Willem became better characters as a result of what they shared and what they experienced. But, after listening to their final joint narration, SukaSuka makes it clear that their relationship at the very least brought out the best in them and their lives.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, not everyone gets to experience something so magical. Yet they did. So, even if the outcome of this story is not the most ideal for the two, the audience can walk away from the show with a smile. Knowing that, like Chtholly and Willem, one should worry not about the inevitability of death and instead care about finding happiness in whatever shape that takes.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC & SOUND\\n\\n\r\nSukaSuka\u2019s musical offerings stand above a lot of the anime\u2019s other traits. Mainly speaking, its original soundtrack has many a poignant piece that supports the steady stream of drama encountered throughout this story.\\n\\n\r\nThe tracks themselves incorporate a lot of orchestral segments that align with the grand yet localized nature of the anime. Female vocalizing provides backup to a slow, light piano ensemble. The sound of a recorder gives way to somber strings that create a fantastical longing in the listener. And, of course, the anime\u2019s signature song \u201cScarborough Fair\u201d \u2013 with its English lyrics, sweeping instrumentation, and bittersweet tone \u2013 may not be around as much as one would like, but, when it is, it captures the ear, ending up as the most memorable part of SukaSuka itself.\\n\\n\r\nAfter the OST, the opening track \u201cDEAREST DROP\u201d also does what it can to make a name for itself. The punchy guitar riff near the start kicks off the song in cool fashion, but the vocals and harmonizing do the most work in threading together this nice track. Some dynamism here and there, a fast-paced beat, and a distinct shaker going off in the background lend their aid as well, making the OP a catchy, fitting tune.\\n\\n\r\nIf the OP somewhat represents the inevitability of death, then the ending track \u201cFrom\u201d represents that pursuit of happiness. Taking on a much livelier tone, the piano segments and acoustic guitar playing bring spirits from low to high over the course of the song. Once again, though, the vocals contribute the most as they hit those higher, powerful notes to give the music its emotion. The ED isn\u2019t as interesting as the OP, and it isn\u2019t exactly a playlist track, but it still has merits within the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe creepy child messing with Chtholly\u2019s head and the twinkling sound-effect when Willem tunes the carillons deserve a small shoutout alongside the OST, the OP, and the ED. All these elements together put SukaSuka\u2019s music and sound in good graces (despite the voice acting not including anything of note).\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nHaving finished this twelve-episode series, I\u2019m less entertained and more disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nThe romance, one of its big selling points, felt more on sale than up as a priceless heirloom. I wanted to really like the relationship between Willem and Chtholly, but it never reached those love-filled heights to me. That\u2019s mostly on Willem. He says as much, but he constantly either pushes Chtholly away or at least keeps her at arm\u2019s length so as not to create any potential problems.\\n\\n\r\nI did like the romance nature of it all though. What with Chtholly blushing from the teasing by her friends or her jealousy of Nygglatho in general. I just didn\u2019t see that all-important spark between the two to make what they had feel special and worth rooting for.\\n\\n\r\nWorse still, I didn\u2019t care for almost any of the characters involved. I don\u2019t hate them, but I can\u2019t say that I will look back fondly on them as I continue watching more and more anime. Take Willem and Chtholly. Willem didn\u2019t do anything too fun or too unique. And Chtholly was a kind girl, and I felt sorry for her that she could not beat back her destiny, but she got a bit annoying at times for how she handled some of her situations.\\n\\n\r\nThen there\u2019s Ren who was cute and Ithea who was spunky, but they were always on the outskirts of most of the drama and the relationships until right at the very end of their presence in the show. Nygglatho\u2019s attractiveness went wasted, and Grick\u2019s coolness went underutilized. Even the fun kids of the warehouse, who had silly introductions and the occasional smiley aside, failed to leave an impression since they just weren\u2019t around.\\n\\n\r\nI do appreciate the show for tackling some tough themes in its story, and I am glad that it managed to tell everything it wanted to in one season. Unfortunately, these details only help to keep me from writing this one off completely.\\n\\n\r\nShuumatsu Nani Shitemasu ka? Isogashii desu ka? Sukutte Moratte Ii desu ka? has its heart in the right place but without the necessary structure to make its message heard. Strong themes for its story are muddied by weak narrative choices. The artistry and the characters pass but miss out on finer execution. And the music is a positive, but it can\u2019t take care of all of the show\u2019s uninteresting elements. Indeed, this project needed a bit more work to uplift it to the pinnacle.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, although touting and exploring the inevitability of death and the pursuit of happiness, the narrative encounters many a trouble in its pacing, delivery, and general writing that keep these philosophical themes suppressed, with or without its attempts to balance everything with some okay world-building\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: Fine, detailed designs, a few involved scenes, and some nice background art make up for the boring cinematography and low levels of movement\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fine, Chtholly and Willem follow those themes on inevitability and happiness as they grow closer together, even if their individual arcs are mixed in total construction\\n\\n\r\nMusic & Sound: Good, a poignant OST, an intriguing OP, and a nice ED provide a lot in terms of musical strength despite the non-noteworthy VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Bad, the romance didn\u2019t have that special spark, and the characters weren\u2019t memorable, but props still earned for reaching certain goals\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 5/10",

            "content": "TLDR: If they focused more effort into the supporting cast, and world building instead of shoving a romance that goes nowhere down my throat it might have been pretty damn good. \r\nStory: Had potential but the way they did it didn't sit right with me. 99% of the time I'm against spoilers...But, THIS ANIME SPOILS IT'S OWN ENDING in the first 40 seconds of the show...The whole time they try to get you invested in the female lead when we know what happens to her. There is romance between two of the main characters, that I felt was really contrived. The writer didn't let theromance blossom and grow over time. From episode one I knew the writer would do whatever it takes to get them together. He tried so hard, their relationship came off really forced to me. Now the ending is really bad, you can have sad endings that are still good. This one is sad and terrible. We knew what was going to happen to one of the main characters, and two others just disappear. Really unsatisfying. 4/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: It's slightly above average but the blood looks really good. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: The music was good it fit the scenes and sounded nice. Some of the tracks really made the emotions of certain characters pop. The sound effects were average. A couple times I heard some of the stock one piece sound effects. (Not necessarily a  bad thing) 8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Most of the interesting characters get barely any screen time, the main cast is okay, but our female lead is really boring to me. I felt bad for her but that's about it. 5/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: There are honestly some scenes that were fun to watch, but I was never really invested in what was going on half the time. At times i'd even go as far as to say I was bored. 4/10\\n\\n\r\nIf it got a season 2 that fixed all the problems I had maybe I could like this series, but with just this season ...I don't think so. TBH I don't even understand how this anime is even ranked in the top 1,000's. Reading other peoples reviews and seeing so many 9, and 10's really blew me away after seeing it for myself.\\n",

            "content": "\"Tragedy is worse when you cannot do anything about it...\"\r\nThis one really hit me hard in the end, but I'm glad I watched it after all. \r\nI'm a sucker for series that I'm promised will give me feels, either happy or sad, and this one didn't disappoint me that much in the end. SukaSuka (let's abbreviate it so we don't have to read the whole damn title) is a story that is more of a tragic romance than a fantasy adventure packed with action, with a touch of reflection about our imminent mortality and how can someone deal with that when a special someoneappears in your life. Our main heroes, Willem and Ctholly are the main couple in the series and ones whose chemistry develops amongst the chaos of the world they live in, and along them comes a charming supporting cast that also enrich the story more. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the most pleasant things to come out of this story is how human most of the characters are, even if only one of them is one actually, but case the point, this anime has little to no clich\u00e9s other series with similar premises show and that is a giant breath of fresh air in an industry oversaturated with old tropes and clich\u00e9s to pander the average anime fan. The characters act according to the situation they are presented to, either as a grown up or a child. Situations where other animes would make their characters flustered or embarrassed are instead presented with normality because the context of the interaction between them is, in fact, non sexual (ableit the animation managed to always make fanservice out of some these moments, but that's up to one's interpretation). The romantic side of this story is also pretty well done: Ctholly starts with a standard crush with Willem at the beginning for helping her and also because he's probably the first male she's ever interacted, but then this relationship starts to evolve into a deeper and more personal love the more time it passes, and the same happens with Willem, who is probably one of the best MCs I've seen when handling these romantic situations. In short, it all feels human and natural, and that is an impressive prowess among other main characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe battle scenes are also pretty well done, even if there's not too much of them. The sound is well done, and the dub (both English and Japanese) was fantastic. The animation is pretty solid as well and the music superb. In fact, \"Always in my Heart\" has become one of the best songs I've heard from animes this year. So yeah, the production for this anime is pretty spot on and it won't disappoint avid fans of the animation.\\n\\n\r\nThe negative side from this series, however, is the story. I'm not saying it's bad, nor that it was boring, but I feel that it lacked just a little more exposition and exploration in a world such as impressive as the one SukaSuka builds above an already doomed Earth. The ending also feels just a little bit rushed and more closure to the characters (either main and secondary) would have been better. But again, this story makes a fantastic job as a romance. But as a fantasy story? I feel the studio couldn't adapt many more things from the source material given the time constraints of each episode, but that's ok.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end this one is one of the best series of the season and one that people who are fans of fantasy worlds and romance should check it out. But beware, the feels may hit you by the end of the season. Not everything has a happy ending, but even so, the hope of a better future will never die.\\n\\n\r\nFINAL SCORE: 9 out of 10.\\n",

The story nicely focuses on the aspect of a man taking care of children more then his life even though they are not related to him in anyway(A good father figure). The story also focuses on relationships that should have never started and are bound to break in future.\r\nAlthough, I would like topoint out that the best part of this title is the OSTs(Original Sound Tracks)..\\n\r\nEvery OST used in different scene/episodes really made me shed tears.

            "content": "This anime was fucking amazing...it needs a possible sequal since it leaves on a cliffhanger..but if you want to know what happens in the rest of the light novel...look below i will give you all the details. \r\nMAJOR SPOILERS... Seriously, don't read if you don't want to be spoiled. Volume 4 picks up with Willem and Ren waking up in Willem's old home town, apparently in the days before the beast outbreak destroys everything. Willem assumes this is some sort of magical mental attack, and they set about trying to find a way out while slowly learning about how things got so messed up inthe past. We witness the final days of the town/humanity, and see the people transforming into monsters. We learn along the way that Almaria, the girl from Willem's orphanage at the end of ep 1, becomes The First beast, a monsterous being that turns everything near it into sand. Not only that, she is still alive - the world Willem and Ren trapped in being made up of the memories and consciousness of the actual people of the town. As the vision comes to an end, Willem kills/releases Almaria, but is infected and becomes a beast himself, and Ren is also infected by... beastness, though she retains herself (mostly.) In volume 5 we're back in the present. So many Timere were killed by Chtholly in the climax of the anime that there are no longer any predicted attacks on the floating islands to come. Possibly ever. Political in-fighting / jockeying for position begins between the islands to break up (or shut down) the fairy warehouse and acquire them for their own uses. One of the islands sends an airship down to investigate the death of the Almaria monster, and retrieves Willem - who is barely able to control his urge to just kill and destroy everything. Shortly thereafter Ren is rescued and sets about trying to find Elq's body, which has also been retrieved, because a talking fish only she can see tells her to do so. This fish is Carmine Lake, one of Elq's guardians from the past, who was forced to enter her body/mind after the events of volume 4. The airship bringing Willem up suffers a containment failure just above one of the islands, and is destroyed. Willem is captured/rescued by his former master from the orphanage, who taught him how to fight in the past. This master magically seals all of his memories, which also seals away the beast impulse to kill and destroy. Willem's master basically gets him a place to live and a job. And who else is there? Why it's the somewhat resurrected Elq. She's still mostly dead, but Willem's master has managed to weaken the curse from Seniorious. She often says things to Willem that Chtholly said, since she has her memories. Big finale: The one island unleashes a beast attack in the capital, and sends in their weapon to fight them - to look strong, and like they are the good guys. Willem's memory block breaks down and he becomes ungodly strong, and again barely able to control himself. At one point the weapon (which looks like a big knight) becomes damaged and we learn that it is powered by fairies that the island has been illegally collecting. Willem decides that this has to be stopped and destroys it. At this point the remaining battle capable fairies, Ithea, Rhan, Tiat, and newly from her doctor tune-up Lakhesh show up (Nopht is back at the warehouse.) Willem has decided to die fighting them to prove they are superior to the other islands weapon and secure their future. Battle ensues and Willem is defeated - the last blow landed by Lakhesh who now wields Seniorious. We learn that what we knew about the beasts was a little off. They weren't humans who turned into monsters and destroyed the world. The ruined sandy surface and monsters were the world's natural state. The Visitors, of whom Elq was the last, shattered their own souls and used the fragments to fashion all the people and plants and the like that existed. Humanity reproduced too much though, and this was stretched to thin, at which point the world snapped back - the beasts all consuming desire for death and destruction is only so they can return home, by remaking the world as it was. The fairies as we know them were created from Elq's soul, which was unsuccessfully shattered by humans trying to extend their world just before the beast outbreak. -- Somewhere along the way we also learned that Willem's master was one of the Visitors as well. (don't remember when exactly they made this clear) Ren, Elq, and Carmine end up living on that island with EbonCandle (the skull) and there's a bit at the end a few years later where a young man comes up to the fairy warehouse and has a run-in with a young blue-haired fairy that looks like a little kid version of Chtholly, and when Nyglattho sees him she freaks.

            "content": "Warning possible Spoilers\r\nSo far most of the spring 2017 anime's have been either meh or alright then I stumbled upon WorldEnd which feels like one of the hidden gems for this season although funny enough the story reminded me of a video game.\r\nThe story is set in a world where humans have been extinct for 500 years and all the other species now live on floating islands away from the Beast's, one human survivor called Willem was frozen until he recently woke up, now he must look after the only weapons that can defeat the Beast's, but these weapons aren't as fearsome as they arefirst thought.\\n\r\nThis story was very enjoyable as it showed what it means to have a truly lovable family that is worth protecting while also showing what being alive truly means too because the main focus is the romantic relationship between the two main characters Willem and Chtholly and how it grows over time, their relationship does go through a lot of bumps and turns with a lot of mixed feelings ranging from happy and adorable to tragic and sad  and it has been a good while since I have seen a romantic relationship that was actually worth supporting because these two characters did click very well together which made the ending much more sadder than I expected.\\n\r\nThe anime also goes into a lot of depth with the origins of the Beast's and the fairy girls and both of their creations are pretty dark backstories since Willem eventually figures out that Beast's are former humans and the fairy girls are made out of dead spirits and if they use their powers too much the former spirit will slowly start taking over their body which is why they use the Gate to destroy the beast's and themselves so even though these fairy girls are cute their way of life is actually pretty sad.\\n\r\nIt was actually very adorable seeing the relationship Willem built up with the other fairy girls because they start out avoiding him since they haven't seen someone like him before, but as time goes on they see him more and more as a father figure and Willem starts to see them as his family and it gave him hope and a reason to keep on living which really shows the true side of his character and it made him learn how important family is.\\n\\n\r\nNow there is quite a lot of characters in this show so I'll only concentrate on the important ones.\\n\r\nWillem is the male MC and the last remaining human in existence, his personality is very mature and soft-spoken though he does joke around from time to time especially with Chtholly, but as the series goes on he does become more open with the other's and eventually considers them his new family and is willing to die to protect them, but most of his character development is when he is with Chtholly since he does fall in love with her which brings out a side of him he hasn't felt for a long time.\\n\r\nChtholly is the female MC and is one of the older fairies, a responsible and mature girl though she sometimes gets into a temper when Willem jokes around with her, she is actually a very interesting female character as her relationship with Willem does make her see life as more than just a fairy that is made to die in the battlefield he opens her eyes to new things and she becomes a better person because of it although sadly this does cause her former spirits life to begin consuming her which causes her to lose memories, but she was a strong person and managed to fight it off for a good while.\\n\r\nIthea and Nephren are the two other older fairies and are Chtholly's best friends, Ithea is the more cheery of the two and often peaks her nose into Chtholly's relationship with Willem and often jokes about it, but she has helped cheer Chtholly up multiple times, Npehren is completely the opposite she doesn't really speak a lot, but cares for the well being of others as she protected multiple soldiers from the beasts which caused her to start changing too.\\n\r\nNygglatho is actually a troll and is the main caretaker of the fairy girls, she likes to joke around with them by saying she'll eat them which is also a good way to make sure their listening to her, but she is a kind person and really cares for the girls often feeling sad that they can only be used as weapons.\\n\r\nNopht and Rhantolk are the two other older fairies that are introduced later on in the series and they both different too, Nopht is the more noisy of the two and often complains or talks too much which gets on Rhantolk's nerves while Rhantolk is more soft spoken and has a large interest in the origin of the Beasts which makes her see Willem as untrustworthy to begin with since he is human.\\n\r\nThen finally there is the large amount of fairy girls who cause all sorts of problems for the characters, they tend to mess around a lot yet despite being little girls they can take a considerable amount of damage as one girl fell down a cliff and felt unfazed by it despite the large amount of blood, but these girls provide a lot of cute entertainment between all the drama.\\n\\n\r\nThe artstyle was actually pretty good I liked that the world has two different aspects like the sky islands which is where everyone lives which reminded of Bioshock infinite partially and then there is the lifeless surface which looks completely different, the design of the Beast's wasn't exactly what I was expecting I thought they would look more like giant dragons or reptiles not huge plant looking things, I also liked how there was a huge variety of designs for the characters and the different species they all looked really cool and each of the fairy girls looked different and felt like their own person.\\n\\n\r\nThe Romance which is the main part of the story was actually done well it has been a while since I've seen a romance that was actually worth something and the relationship that builds between Willem and Chtholly went through a lot of emotions ranging from cute and adorable moments like when their at the home looking over the kids and doing other stuff while there are also moments that are sad and tragic like the spirit slowly taking over Chtholly's body which brought about a few sad conversations between the two which really sold me on the relationship.\\n\\n\r\nThere is actually bit's of action in here too though not as much as I expected, but when it did show action it was actually pretty gorey as the beast's don't mess around and most of the series is pretty calm with a few action scenes that weren't too bad until the final episodes when all hell breaks lose I'm actually surprised people survived the battle in the end.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is actually a pretty good anime for this season as it had a nice mixture of different emotional moments while also giving us good characters and a worthwhile romantic relationship so I'd definitely recommend checking this out if you're a fan of Romance.",

It was my selection for possibly best show of the season,  but alas, sometimes execution falters. \r\nBriefly lets discuss the show: The last human in existence, a military second lieutenant,  finds himself in a world of civilization Destroying beasts being fought off by a plethora of different creatures including humanoid animals, leprechauns, and more. Wilhelm, the last human, wants to protect those important to him, at any and all costs.\r\nto summarize the overall experience:\r\n plot wise, the story is compelling.you care for the characters and how they change across the season, you want to know whats happening and its cause.\\n\\n\r\nfor the cast, character interactions are sweet, and personal feeling. You like to understand each individual.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of artwork, scenes are colorful and vibrant, characters are adorable and their models  welcoming. many characters have their unique forte, and personality traits. \\n\\n\r\nWhere this show falters though is its execution. Scenes feel unfinished, characters reactions feel flat, and the ending was rushed due to the episode cap. Episode 1-8 I truly enjoyed, but the final 4 were a sloppy mess of trying to invoke emotion, with little support and development to warrant it.The show had the narrative for feels, it had the setup early on, but ultimately, it became a forced effort in order to accommodate the time slot for the season. \\n\\n\r\nI give this show a 7 because I did find much of it touching, I did really like Chtholly, wilhelm, and many animation sequences such as the sword tinkering, and the internal mental conflicts, but the way some scenes felt so pushy on how you had to feel, and how the show necessarily had to progress with a specific emotion or interpretation took away from some of the splendor that it began with. The cute lovely characters became silhouettes of fulfilling a role, and that truly saddens me as this show had so much potential. \\n\\n\r\nIf you loved it, im glad you felt what i wished for, if you haven't seen it, I leave you with this: personally, i felt for it, I liked the emotion, the resolve, the ingenuity, but I felt in the end, poor time management and perogative greatly weakened what could have been. Watch with some resistance, as like I, you may be let down in the end. \\n",

If it would be a 24 episode long series it could be much, much more, this story had potential, the characters had potential, the story was flooding just right.\r\n    So, the first episode already got me, how our Hero being hated out of the town (basically because he wasn't furry). The were wonderful views and a bloody-badass flash in the beginning.\r\n    The other thing caught me was the soundtrack,that reminded me the \"Continued Story\" from Code Geass. \\n\r\n    The best thing was the character developement or the destruction, even in visuals. \\n\r\n     Amazingly compex Heroine.\\n\r\n - But Jorgeb, there must be bad points, right?\\n\r\n - Yeah, the cheapass ending, they really should strech it to 24 episode. In that case I wouldn't have to fear the sequel, if there will be any. The characters weren't emotionally ready for this ending, and they made it like it not necessary needs a second season.\\n\\n\r\nWatch it if you like monster apocalypse with fighting magical girls.\\n\\n\r\nJ-score:   \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\\n\r\nIt was crunchy as hell ;)",

            "content": "No matter how many reviews you write, sometimes there's always going to be that one series that, while decent, is difficult to recommend to anyone in particular. So, with that short introduction, let's get into the review...\r\n-Story:\r\nThe story mainly follows Willem, who is one of (I think) the last humans alive on earth. After a series of cataclysmic events that ravaged the earth and left it uninhabitable, he was frozen in suspended animation, until he was woken up many years after said events. He wakes to find that all humans have been extinct for a long period of time, and that all other living racesnow live on floating islands in the sky to protect themselves from the surface (Willem's former home) which is overrun with monsters. While taking odd jobs, he meets Chtholly, a young girl who turns out to be a leprechaun. In this world, leprechauns are essentially sacrificial weapons tasked with protecting the citizens of the sky islands from the beasts that dwell below. To accomplish their tasks, they wield magical swords called \"dug weapons\", which are used to slay the beasts. The story primarily follows these two as they become acquainted with each other and start working together in the same military weapons facility. Along the way, they each have to deal with their own internal struggles and emotional baggage, while also trying to come to terms with not only the harsh reality that they're faced with, but also their developing feelings toward one another.\\n\\n\r\nSo, to change up the format a little, I'm going to list what I liked and disliked about the story in bullet points:\\n\\n\r\n+ The leprechauns face a cruel and short existence, which is shown in detail. They each know that they won't live long lives, but they still try to find what little happiness and meaning they can in their short lifespans.\\n\r\n+ The relationship between Willem and Chtholly is done VERY well. Unlike many anime, it feels natural, and not forced in the slightest. They both start out as friends, but develop into much more, while trying to change themselves for the sake of the other.\\n\r\n+ The world is written in a way that makes it interesting, leaving you wanting to know more. \\n\r\n+ There's racial tension between the \"featured\" (lizards, fur-people, etc) and the \"non-featured\" (trolls, leprechauns, and Willem, a human), which I thought was a great touch. \\n\r\n- There's far too many unexplained aspects relating to the inner-workings of the world and it's history. It's an interesting world, but we're only shown very little of past events or how many things in the world came to be.\\n\r\n- Definitely some plot holes here and there.\\n\r\n- There's multiple plot devices that are introduced but never utilized in the slightest (such as the dug weapon lapis-something something)\\n\r\n- Many of the emotional moments come off as being very melodramatic. \\n\r\n- The few \"fanservice\" and lewd moments come off as being a bit odd and out of place. Multiple characters also accuse Willem of being a pedophile (since he works in a mansion full of young female leprechauns), and while it may be intended as a joke, the humor is fairly dry.\\n\r\n- The ending. I'm not going to spoil it, but for me, it leaves a lot to be desired. It's not that it's bad, but it leaves a few things up to the viewer's interpretation (which some may see as a good thing). \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nWillem is your (somewhat) typical protagonist with a strong sense of justice. He has a tragic past and is plagued by feelings of regret and guilt for not being able to save his friends and family in the past. Then there's Chtholly, an emotional, caring, and reckless girl who values her friends and puts her life on the line to protect them. She also acts as a big-sister for many of the younger leprechauns. These two see the bulk of the character development in this story, while other characters remain pretty much static throughout the entirety of the series. There's also quite a few characters who just fill the role for their assigned archetype. Many of the characters also aren't properly characterized or fleshed out, making them seem fairly bland and unimportant. \\n\\n\r\nSound and Animation:\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is done by studio Satelight and C2C and honestly, it's quite good. I didn't notice any off-models, and most scenes were detailed and vivid in color. The few fight scenes in the series, while not the best I've seen, are still done relatively well. \\n\\n\r\nThe music in this series is...interesting. The opening and ending songs are fitting and fairly good (albeit forgettable), and the OST itself doesn't really stick out much, but blends in well with the majority of scenes. The \"interesting\" aspect that I mentioned is that, this anime uses Celtic Woman's \"Scarborough Fair\" as an insert song at a couple points in the story. I was actually surprised to hear it, and even more surprised at how well it fit into the theme and overall focus of the series itself (namely, Chtholly's desire to be with Willem).\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\\n\r\nThere is no doubt that Suka Suka is an anime with a number of flaws that hold it back from becoming a truly wonderful story. It also seemed like the director was unsure of the direction that he/she wanted to take the series, which puts it into a weird middle ground. Despite my criticisms with this anime, I still can't say that I didn't find some enjoyment in it. If you can look past it's various flaws, at it's core, Suka Suka does do a good job at showcasing it's central themes of self-salvation, mortality, and the pursuit of happiness. If those themes interest you, and you don't mind wading through the melodrama and clumsily written story, this anime might hold something worthwhile for you.",

However there are some generic aspects to it such as a mildly forced relationship but I can see how they end up together. The beginning is a very kind opening to any viewer and gives us the names of the characters and setting. \r\nHowever I personally enjoy this show for the mystery aspect of the story and how the beast's came to be. Willem's past is also interesting and his past keeps getting shown throughout the story to give the watcher a more interestingtime to think about the plot. The present time of Chtholly and the other girls help support the story but also give the story the main action scenes that we enjoy. \\n\\n\r\nThe romance aspect is rather fast paced but I however enjoyed the development of the characters personally. However I don't think this story is focused around romance, but more mystery. Every episode cracks a new thought the original writer gave and give us more and more details of what this world is about. \\n\\n\r\nOverall this is my favorite show this season and like many other great underrated shows after running out of episodes I felt empty and bored.",

            "content": "Oh boy... SukaSuka or Shuumatsu Nani Shitemasu ka? Isogashii Desu ka? Sukutte Moratte Ii Desu Ka?... I remember when I was still a teenage boy, getting into anime and watching several shows of both classic and modern. I sat there as I pondered into the screen of my tablet, as I could hear from my computer the sounds of a \"What will I be watching for this season\" video. The selection was a bit interesting, but one had caught my eye. This was the one. After the first episode aired, I watched the subbed version and I was hooked. This is... without a doubt, ahidden gem for me for this season.\\n\r\nSukaSuka is an anime with elements such as romance, tragedy and drama that enters a post-apocalyptic world where we see that the main character, Willem, is the last one of his race. He has the past of a miserable brave. After waking up from his \"slumber\", he finds himself in a world where humanity has been wiped out. He discovers himself saving a girl who has sky blue hair and ocean eyes, Chtholly, who later asks him if she could grant one of her wishes. He is then offered a job for the military to watch over \"secret weapons\". Willem soon finds out that he is assigned alongside Chtholly, who tells him that she and the others of the warehouse they live in are the secret weapons. Their tragic story starts from there.\\n\r\nUpon the first episode, we're thrown into an opening where we see the future. We see a girl with red hair walking down a corridor on an airship while everyone in there is fighting off beasts. Her eyes are complete hollow while we get a scene of a man desperately trying to save a girl while he's falling. The girl with red hair starts talking about the man before she then jumps off the airship, and then, we're shown the title screen. This scene was perhaps, one of the more powerful ones, it showed us what was happening, and the dialogue was enough to make us understand what we were in for. It had a great OST that had me piqued at first. \"Always in my Heart\" was a great song for this scene and I knew that this... was something I would cry at.\\n\r\nNow, I've only given out that scene for an analyzation because I don't want to spoil the whole entire story for you or else it'll be not that fun for you to explore this own path yourself. I will be using several scenes, but they won't be enough to spoil the entire story.\\n\r\nSukaSuka is a beautiful show. It holds one of the best OSTs and is one of my favorites, lying close to my heart. After watching this show side by side with others, I gradually became invested with its story and characters. I knew something was going to happen, yet I was oblivious of it due to how deep I was invested with the show. In the next paragraph, I will begin by explaining why this show is so special to me with the starting scene after the opening sequence on episode 1.\\n\r\nAt a distant town, we can see a sky-blue haired girl chasing down a cat with a gem in its mouth. After she corners the cat, the cat jumps on her and she is thrown off balance. She falls towards the road of the area she's in, and a man rushes to catch her. The man is Willem and the woman is Chtholly. Willem helps out Chtholly with the island's path. During this, we get Scarborough Fair playing, this time, the song has the words edited out from \"her\" to \"him\". The song brought harmony to my ears while we got to see their adventures on the island.\\n\r\nI chose this scene since it was pretty big. It had a foreshadowing of Willem desiring to be with Chtholly through the usage of Scarborough Fair. We also got to see that Chtholly wish is also teased. This gets us hooked on the show, and we continue watching. For me, this part established a bit of the two characters. This part is one of my favorite ones in this series.\\n\r\nSukaSuka is one of those shows that can play around with your heart with the possibility that they can crush it or tickle it. Each scene in there is meaningful and further establishes the character. By the end of this show, I was probably crying for a good ten minutes with my fist clenched and my mouth closed. I was desperately trying to not cry yet I broke.\\n\r\nHere are my ratings and my explanations for the show:\\n\r\nStory - 8.3/10. The show ended off disappointing, I would say. We cut from a really sad scene to a panel of scenes where we just see Limeskin satisfied at the two soldiers who had died on the battlefield and the aftermath of the battle... The scene was a bit offputting. We ended up with no explanation at the end with a baby being found. I supposed that these questions would be only answered if I read the light novel, which was probably what they wanted to get us to do.\\n\r\nArt - 9.7/10. The art was mesmerizing to look at. If we saw the scene with Willem tuning the swords, that could be one of the beautiful scenes.\\n\r\nSound - 10/10. To me, I remember SukaSuka through its amazing OST. Each song fits the show and conveys a deep message to us. That's what I love SukaSuka for.\\n\r\nCharacters - 9.5/10. Could've improved a bit better with some scenes that were made in the LN. I know that the studio couldn't probably do it, but some of the scenes could've helped us love the characters more. Every major girl in here can be argued for being the best girl of this series.\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9.8/10. I will definitely remember this ride that I had in 2017. I will always remember when. The characters are woven always in my heart. The only problem was with the disappointment I had at the ending, which kinda ruined how I felt.\\n\r\nOverall - 9.3/10. Unfortunately, I would've liked to rate this higher, but I don't think I can with that ending.\\n\r\nSukaSuka is without a doubt something I will recommend to my friends. It was able to break my heart and leave me depressed for almost five days before I was able to get back up.\\n\r\nI'm pretty sure that another rewatch for SukaSuka will happen during this year - in 2019 - however, we'll just wait and see.\\n\r\nDuring writing this, I've noticed that some of the reviews on here were negative. I can understand their tastes and respect their decision. However, if you're not interested in watching SukaSuka by just their review ratings and that, I highly suggest that you should watch it and see it for yourself. SukaSuka was supported a lot around the world when it aired.\\n\r\nAfter finishing the anime, I highly recommend the light novel. It definitely will be worth it!",

            "content": "This show was something else. It could have used better world building and lore development and I would have liked to see more secondary characters get more time to grow. At times it can be fairly confusing and attempts to be overly complex without bothering to explain itself. But for all its faults, I really loved this show.\r\nThe story centers on one Willem Kmetsch, the last human being alive in a world that was brought to ruin by enigmatic monsters called \"beasts.\" What remains of the world is now populated by humanoid animal people and mythical creatures like goblins (there's a troll involved but shelooks like a normal person). Willem's life takes a dramatic turn when he's assigned as caretaker to a group of \"leprechauns\", young girls who wield weapons capable of killing the beasts. He comes to love and care for these girls like they were his own daughters, and he forms a very intimate relationship with one of the older girls, Chtholly.\\n\\n\r\nLet me tell you something, this show is sad. It's about girls who are seemingly fated to die in battle finding something to live for, pursuing their own ideals of happiness despite their tragic lot in life. The love that forms between Willem and Chtholly is both heartwarming and heartbreaking to witness and by the story's end you might find yourself cursing this godforsaken world they inhabit. That's not to say that the plot is entirely sad, as there's also a lot of hope here and the promise that we can leave this world better than we found it.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as animation goes, the show is pretty adequate. The character models  are fairly well realized, especially the animal people and the leprechauns. The show's world is also interesting to behold, from medieval-esque cities in the sky to esoteric spiritual realms. There's also some cool visual effects as the leprechauns tap into their true power. There's a touch of CGI in the show and it's not very good, but it's not there very often so it's tolerable.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the show's score; it ranges from playful and charming to haunting and mournful. Since the events of the plot will make you run the gauntlet emotionally, it would only make sense that the soundtrack also does. Let me just say one song in particular stood out to me; a rendition of \"Scarborough Fair\" by Yamada Tamaru. Simply beautiful. Even if you don't watch the show, look up her performing it; mesmerizing.\\n\\n\r\nSo, why does this show lose some points with me? It doesn't explain itself all that well. There are some plot points that I felt came out of left field or just weren't conveyed properly. What's worse is that the show sometimes acts as if we should somehow magically know this stuff; I didn't read the light novel and I don't plan to, so help me out here! I think there's a fascinating and deep lore worth exploring here, but the problem is that us anime viewers are only given a very small window to observe it through.\\n\\n\r\nWhen all it said and done, this show has several flaws that might alienate some potential viewers. It's far from perfect but I very much enjoyed it despite its imperfections. It's a bittersweet story of love, fate and loss that will tug on your heartstrings (the last shot of the show in particular got me). If you're willing to overlook some flaws, I think you'll find WorldEnd/SukaSuka to be a show that will leave a mark on your heart.\\n\\n",

Nothing special. Nowt to write home about. An overall lack of depth to any and all characters makes them feel flat, two-dimensional and difficult to become invested in. \r\nThe world lacks fleshing out, feeling hollow and empty. exposition is sparse when desired and when apparent is dealt with clumsily. \r\nIf you are bored then maybe have a look, but honestlythere are many shows out there that create a world similar to this, with the same time-frame per episode and yet still create an intricate, nuanced universe that you can't help being pulled into.

            "content": "Shuumatsu Nani Shitemasu ka? Isogashii desu ka? Sukutte Moratte Ii desu ka?\r\nThere will be spoilers. \r\nThis was a show which I put off watching for a long time because I expected it to be an emotionally punishing experience, I ended up watching it over the course of two (working) days and in the end it left me with one (long-winded) question:\r\nIs this show an earnest and cack-handed attempt to deliver a tragic tale of redemption through the salvation of others or is it a brazenly cynical and exploitative mashup of stock tropes and pre-packed themes that are verging on the Pavlovian?\r\nSo, what is this show?Imagine a pastiche of Saikano or Gunslinger Girl and Neon Genesis Evangelion in the now inescapable Isekai setting. Rather than a smooth flowing narrative it has juddering pacing that pulls you in at times and then ejects confused and annoyed moments later. The show is thick with utterly needless elements that provide filler and remind us that MC is a Nice Guy(TM) but which ultimately do little to advance the story, which itself is not bad. Sometimes a tragic show needs some light elements to break up the bleakness, lay it on too thick though and you suffer from clutter and a tempo that's all over the place, sometimes less is more.\\n\\n\r\nTl;dr A show with the potential to be a moving experience which whether by hook or crook failed to deliver its promise. (and I think that on balance it was probably cack-handed rather than exploitative.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n[SPOILERS]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nYour premise, dear viewer, is; Mary Sue MC with super powers, because reasons, and the living weapon girls he must save, live in a world of floating islands while the earth below is populated by an incomprehensible alien enemy with which there can be no reasoning and which seeks to wipe out humanity. Oh, also all of humanity is already dead (apart from our superhuman Hero, naturally) and the sky islands are populated by furries, lizardmen, goblins and golems, because reasons. Oh and there's some kind of racial tension between the aforementioned characters and the characters who aren't furries, lizardmen, goblins and golems and instead look like humans but they're not called humans, because again, reasons. The only purpose for this sub-plot seems to be to remind us that MC is a Nice Guy(TM) and to provide light relief, like rubbing the belly of a furry is arousing to the furry and that's funny, rather than a sexual assault, again, MC is a Nice Guy(TM), not a predator with a messiah complex.\\n\\n\r\nSo, the emotional thrust of the story, like Saikano or Gunslinger Girl, the greatest weapon is a little girl (just go with it, the juxtaposition of inhuman violence and pigtails & scrapped knees is an important literary device). The show wants you to know that these girls are fated to die and that they don't care about their own lives (and you, dear viewer, should because they're innocent little girls and it is cruel that their blood should be shed to maintain the segregationist military state) in case you missed its subtly hints that this was the case it will also beat you about the head with it to make sure you get that they're going to die and they don't care. Then, perhaps more successfully it will show through exposure to MC they actually don't want to die, despite being conditioned, socially and medically to march onwards towards their noble deaths. \\n\\n\r\nThe show has some motifs that it plays heavily on, I found the visuals of catching people who were falling and the changes to Ctholly's hair to be really sweet and emotive. Although, the age gap between MC and Ctholly is more than a little problematic, something which the show seems to deal with by presenting him as \"youthful\" when he is rather more likely twice her age.\\n\\n\r\nLike Saikano, Gunslinger Girl and Neon Genesis Evangelion the show does raise some pretty deep questions, unfortunately it is rather less successful than any of them in dealing with them. The pacing really does not help nor does the fact that the story relies so heavily on the stock archetypes to paper over the fact that it didn't bother to show you character motivations. Here's a character that appears to be asocial and is incapable of emoting, but is also fiercely loyal to the characters they have glomped onto... so... that's why she did what she did, it's her archetype, not her character...  \\n\\n\r\nIf you want to enjoy it watch the ending once and do not think about it again shut down your mind and enjoy the bwaaah. Unfortunately if you allow yourself that moment to analyse what just happened it falls apart. I got teary at the emotional crescendo, it set up the dilemma, the choice was made, the love was strong, the sacrifice was real....... We see the hole that is left in the lives of the characters that remain, we see that the sacrifice did not save the world. Had the show had a run time of 22:39 it would have been a fine ending.... \\n\\n\r\nBut... the credits roll over an epilogue... The epilogue exposes the pap, the cowardly retreat from all of the impact of the ending and an infuriating retreat from the theme of the entire show. \\n\\n\r\n[/SPOILERS]\\n\\n",

It sounded really interesting and unique.  And it was, it's just that they underutilized that premise.  They chose to focus a bit to much on the love between Willem and Chtholly.  I didn't mind it's inclusion, it just ended up overpowering the main story.\r\nThe problem I had was the series left me wanting more.  Iwanted to know more backstory and history of the events leading up to what is happening now.  I wanted to see more of the surface and the monsters they talked so much about.  I wanted to see the fight against the monsters progressing.  It was all too glossed over, leaving too many gaps and questions.",

I was expecting something lighter and bittersweet, it delivers and then some.\r\nArt: For the story and style it doesn\u2019t really fit. Its trying to turn genre conventions on their heads.\r\nCharacter: Pretty decent cast but too diverse with not enough time to flesh them out. I have no idea why but a lot of them became cardboard cutouts halfway through the show, episode 5 in particular. They say things nobody would say and it comes off terrible. The authors naming sense is also pretty bad. I\u2019ve read some weird names thatwere Tolkien inspired but holy crap does this have some bad names that don\u2019t follow the rules of language. \\n\\n\r\nStory: The story was trying to be deep and fails at it. It has a lot of melodrama that disappoints. Again a lot of the problems occur after the fourth episode. Also since I don\u2019t have anywhere else to complain about it what the hell is up with this title. It sounds like he couldn\u2019t decide between 3 titles and decided to combine them into one ridiculously long monstrosity.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Pretty good music but nothing really stood out to me and hit me in the feels. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: I came in with high expectations that sadly the show couldn\u2019t fulfill. I wouldn\u2019t recommend it or watch it with someone who hasn\u2019t seen it.\\n",

            "content": "IMPORTANT NOTE: This is my very first anime review so please don't judge me too harshly on this.\r\nIf you're a fan of KEY's products like I am and like stories that involve drama, tragedy, and emotional heartbreak then you will definitely like this anime. However, if you were expecting something more out of this anime like I was then you're pretty much going to be disappointed because of the amount of wasted potential this anime had. From my point of view the reason for this is because of how the story was held back through certain elements of the plot. Now I haven't read allthe volumes of the LNs this anime is based on, but even if I did I doubt it would change my opinion very much. So I'm just going to be straight up honest of why this anime ended up disappointing me the most this season.\\n\\n\r\nWHAT THIS ANIME DID WRONG...\\n\r\nThe setting of this anime alone is enough to catch you're interest. We are presented to a world where humanity was wiped out and is now populated by furries. We are then introduced to Willem, the last living human in the world along with the fairies, or leprechauns, magical soldiers that are all female created to fight the monstrous beasts that have appeared around the world in which normal soldiers cannot destroy. Soon afterward Willem is selected to be the fairies' \"Commanding Officer\" and father figure partly to his knowledge and experience with Mud Weapons, the magic weapons used by the fairies use to to destroy the beasts.\\n\\n\r\nAt first glance this seems like an anime with the potential to be something great despite a relatively generic setting we've seen before. Unfortunately though, the interesting plot elements and ideas of story has end up suffering from poor execution. The the further you watch the series you begin to notice problems with the overall plot of the story that never really get fully explained or resolved. And the reason for that is because show focuses far too much on the past of this world's setting and not so much on the present.\\n\\n\r\nFor example, we're shown how the beasts came to be but we're never told of why exactly they're a threat to the world. So in the end you can't but think that these beasts are just annoying pests that the army just feels obligated to get rid of. Another problem is Elq, a character that share's a special connection to both the world's past and to the fairies. Throughout the show we are told where the fairies came from along with her relationship with Chtholly, and that's it. Unless I missed something we're never really told what Elq's goals are or why she was so focused on Chtholly aside from what we already know. So in the end you're left asking, \"What exactly is was point of Elq's character?\".\\n\\n\r\nOne would argue that you would have to read the LNs, especially after Volume 3, to really understand the story. While that isn't necessarily a bad thing, the problem is that viewers shouldn't have to rely on the LNs to understand the whole picture. The anime should be doing that for them, which sadly did not.\\n\\n\r\nAnother big problem with this anime is its lack of focus and lack of tension. Putting aside the last two episodes we see only a handful of battles between the fairies and the beasts. Most of the anime's focus is at home where the fairies are growing up. In any other story I wouldn't mind this but when the story gives the impression that it's suppose to be a war drama, the focus should be on the battlefront and not so much at home.\\n\\n\r\nNow some fans will argue that this anime is not a war drama or even an action series, it's suppose to be a tragedy. While they're not entirely wrong, they're not exactly right either because a war drama is a form of tragedy. A tragedy doesn't have to be about drama and emotional heartbreak. It can be about the loss of youth, innocence, or even life. And since this story features characters who are part of the military and are fighting against a certain enemy, it counts as a war drama. A poorly executed one at that.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're going to have a war drama story that involves soldiers and any sort of conflict you need to have three things:\\n\\n\r\n1. Who or what are the characters fighting against?\\n\r\n2. What are the characters fighting for?\\n\r\n3. Most importantly, how will the experiences in battle affect the characters both in body in mind and how will they deal with it both during and after the war?\\n\\n\r\nAll three of these things are needed in a war drama. If you just have one or the other it's not going to work. This anime shows what the characters are fighting against but we're never told what they are fighting for or how they deal with what they experienced after it's all over. Instead, the anime decides to focus more on Willem's and Chtholly's relationship, how the other fairies interact with the outside world, and discovering the past.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, this would be fine in any other story but the problem here is that the anime is not focusing on rather the real problem, which is the beasts. And because it's not explained why they're such a threat, since the rest of the world doesn't to be really concerned about them, there is a severe lack of tension. We're given no reason to care about the world should it fall to the beasts.\\n\\n\r\nAnd in the end, it feels more like an insult than a sad ending because nothing changes after the big finale. The anime basically ends the way it started, making you feel like you just wasted nearly 300 minutes of your time for nothing. A few characters die and life just goes on like their deaths meant nothing. Seriously, what kind of story is that? What kind of message is that suppose to give?\\n\\n\r\nWHAT THIS ANIME DID RIGHT...\\n\r\nDespite all my problems, I did like some of the things this anime did have. The setting and the entire concept was enough to get me interested and it stayed that way throughout the whole show. I also really liked the romance between the main two characters partly because I'm a sucker for tsunderes but also because of how believable it was.\\n\\n\r\nWillem's character was also a major plus for this show. You can feel his guilt on the being the very last human being in the world and how he failed to keep his promise with those he knew in his past life. You can see that he wants a second chance to have the life he never had and how he sees the opportunity to obtain through the fairies he takes care of. It's easy to understand why he cares about them so much although some of his reactions were over exaggerated and in my opinion out of character.\\n\\n\r\nChtholly was also a nice character but the whole degeneration of her mind thing bugged me because it felt it was only holding her character back from being a great one for the sake of emotional heartbreak. In other words, it just didn't have any kind of real impact on me.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters are great as well but since most of them don't get sufficient enough screen time there's not very much reason to care about them. Personally, I think it would have been more interesting if an entire division of these fairy soldiers had been created consisting of both males and females instead of having a Loli's paradise. It would have fascinating to see how they \"grow up\".\\n\\n\r\nThe Mud Weapons were interesting concepts but I think it would have been really cool if the military had been able to make firearm versions. Imagine a scene where normal rifle has no effect on a beast but is then that beast is blown in half but a Mud version of that same rifle. That would have been sick.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is excellent but not really spectacular and the songs were a nice touch but the music score  fell rather short.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the anime does have its good moments but it suffers from poor execution and lack of focus.\\n\\n\r\nWHAT COULD HAVE MADE THIS ANIME BETTER?\\n\r\nWell, better execution for one and focusing more on the bigger issue for another. Maybe even give a better story. The story needed to be about the fairies and their experiences in battle, them becoming aware of themselves, and finding a reason to live. It should not just be about Willem and Chtholly or about how humanity was wiped out because in the end past no longer matters. It's done! Over with! Time to move on!\\n\\n\r\nOne of the things I like to do going all the way back when I was a kid was to watch a movie and imagine characters from another setting in the same film. For example, when The Lord of the Rings first came out I used to watch it while imagining The Legend of Zelda characters in it. For this, let me use a movie example to give you an idea of what I feel this anime should have been about.\\n\\n\r\nIf I would rewrite this story based on how I reviewed it, the movie I would use as an example would be the 2002 war film \"We Were Soldiers\". That movie did an excellent job of having the three crucial things of a war drama that I listed above. In addition, it also did an excellent job of balancing out the effects of war between the battlefield and at home.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime could have been very much like \"We Were Soldiers\", but it ended up sacrificing one crucial part of the story for the sake of another. You can have romance, drama, and emotional heartbreak in a war drama, but the main focus needs to be on the battlefront. This isn't impossible with what this anime had to offer. I know it can work and I'm going to into further detail on why it can in my \"Anime That Deserved Better\" topic that I will post later on in this forum.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're a fan of this anime and are curious about the movie \"We Were Soldiers\" here's my suggestion. Watch the movie, then watch again. Only this time watch it while imagining this anime's characters playing the same roles in that film. Then maybe you'll see why why I feel this anime deserved better than what it got.\\n\\n\r\nI'm DirectorK and until next time, stay tuned.",

Do we ever get into the details of how the fairies' powers work? Not really...I still don't know what Venerum is and it got mentioned a lot. Why do furries hate human-looking creatures so much? I can't think of a logical reason why, really.What did the MC do most of the series? Live with a bunch of little girls and being depressed. \r\nCharacters: 6\r\nAnd that 6 is only becauseat least there were things going on with them. Some of their actions, however, don't make any sense, especially at the end. Something about a gate got mentioned and I just honestly got really confused. To be fair however, Chtolly's character felt more or less like watching someone with Alzheimers worsen in condition. MC's development...well...he just felt like a depressed guy.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nThe artstyle is nothing special here for both the backgrounds as well as the characters. Chtolly's hair changing color was not particularly well done either.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nNothing special here. I feel the opening song is probably the most interesting thing about this show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\r\nThis didn't become something I dropped because I at least wanted to know where this show was going.

Absolute amazing, steampunk world of airships and floating isles. Beautiful artwork, both backgrounds and characters. Grim setting with a stern focus on racism, war, and psychological/morale aspect. After watching the first episode, you may think \"oh, this looks like the Title of the Year!\"...\r\n...And then, we cometo the plot and how it is presented here. Well, i must say even Gate series creators, implemented the fanservice more naturally that it is done here. The world of heavy drama, epic fights, deaths, and difficult morale choices? Lets make some epic adventures series that would be worshipped for decades by a loyal community? Nope -  lets add maids, lolis, lolis with superpowers, and outright rom-com/harem fancervice cliches. Oh, and how can you forget the massive plotholes!\\n\\n\r\nVerdict: This anime tries to be both a serious throught-provoking drama, like Shinsekai Yori or Sidonia no Kishi, and a light-hearted comedy with some fantasy adventures as a background, like KonoSuba or Zero no Tsukaima. At the same time. Which is simply impossible, and is the exact reason why this one title is a fail. You can't seat on two chairs at once.\\n\\n\r\nRating: I rated this anime 7/10, but thats almost exclusively for the first episode, which is absolutely magnificent. Otherwise this is 5/10 at best.",
