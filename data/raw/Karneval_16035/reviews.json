            "content": "Karneval is a mysterious series. By mysterious, I don't entirely mean it being filled with clues to be solved by some detective. What I mean is how the series comes together through its plot, theme, and most importantly the characters of the mysterious 'Circus'. It spells out mystery in a variety of ways through fantasy and its elegant atmosphere. However, Karneval is one of those series that can be a hit or miss for potential viewers.\r\nThe anime series Karneval is based off the manga of the same named written by Touya Mikanagi. With 10 volumes and counting, the manga has received some attention, enough foran anime adaptation. So here we are, spring 2013 and the series makes it on to the screen for the very first time. \\n\\n\r\nTo me, Karneval is one of those shows where a variety of things happen, some at the same time. The series has that fantasy background with majestic themes. The series focuses on a mysterious group known as the \u201cCircus\u201d. The way they dress seems to fit within this theme but their actions are a bit different. For a variety of reasons, this organization serves a protection force. In other words, they work to ensure that the safety of its people are guaranteed. To do things, it seems that its members relies on teamwork, magic, strategies, and even acrobat movements. It enforces the fact that its members are skilled enough for the task. Of course though, these tasks often puts its members of Circus' lives at risks. There is danger ranging from armed kidnappers to mysterious creatures. Among other factors, the members themselves sometimes has internal factors that prevents them from accomplishing tasks at their best. But at any rate, this mysterious group known as Circus is the drive force behind the series.\\n\\n\r\nTwo of the most prominent members associated Circus are Nai and Gareki. There is a lot of mystery going on between these two characters. For one, we learn that Nai is searching for something important. After a dangerous incident, he meets Gareki who saves his life. And here becomes their little adventure as Nai and Gareki becomes friends. On the surface, the two seems to get along but their characters' basis contrasts greatly in comparisons. Nai is portrayed as a boy who is often feels like he is a loner along with feelings of cowardliness around certain situations. We can tell by his face expressions that he is quite nervous throughout each episode. On the opposite of the coin, there's Gareki. His expressions gives off a confident, rough, and sometimes arrogant atmosphere. He is also seen as fearless in many situations and doesn't hesitant to speak his mind to make the first move. Although they seem so different, the two becomes a compatible duo; in a rather peculiar fashion.\\n\\n\r\nThe majority of the supporting characters makes up the 'Carneval'. All of them seems to have specialized skills to handle various situations. For example, there is the beautiful and well respected girl Tsukumo who is skilled in acrobatics and is able to take down foes with a calm mind. There's also Yogi, a cheerful young man who is able to evoke fear through his magic. Then, there's the Hirato, the Second Ships' captain with a mind of intellect capable of managing the team through various tasks. The point is that Carneval takes on challenges fearlessly and with precision to ensure its success. They work for the government and takes out the most dangerous individuals out of their world to ensure a place without fear. On the other hand exists another organization, one that opposes Carneval for their actions known as Kafka. They are even more mysterious as we know nearly nothing about them besides that they oppose the government and conducts in illegal activities. Yup, here it is again, mystery...\\n\\n\r\nThe story of this anime adapted series is a bit difficult to comprehend. In fact, some fans may be confused to what's going on that may lead to a scratch on their heads. I'll say it out straight: the story is a bit blend and requires a bit of focus to enjoy Karneval at its fullest. Apparently, Nai used to be an acquittance or possible friend of a mysterious young man named Karoku. The accessory (bracelet) is a proof of his past relationship with him. Throughout the series, we also see Karoku make screen appearances but have little clue to his true origin or identity. Speaking of which, Nai's own identity is a puzzle throughout the series as well. His name literally means 'nothing' in English. The way he looks also makes the boy seems quite feminine and his nervousness doesn't help him shape into a more masculine image. He often has to rely on others whether it's the tough bad boy Gareki or members of Circus. This makes the main male protagonist Nai a bit hard to appreciate or respect. He hardly develops throughout the series and becomes more frustrating to watch each episode as the only way he can achieve tasks is with the help of others. There's an old saying that goes 'if you want something done right, do it yourself'. Nai is nowhere near that philosophy yet and becomes a pain to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThere's also some confusion related to the other characters as the atmosphere of the show seems to be quite slow paced. Furthermore, it's even sometimes difficult to tell who the real antagonists are. Needless to say, the construction of the characters along with the plot are blend and hard to appreciate. On the bright side though, the action of this series flows quite well with the movements of its characters. Speaking of which, the characters' designs are elegant and beautiful. Tsukumo can be seen as a mascot for this series by the way she is dressed. Then, there are the guys like Gareki and Yogi who gives off an impression with their good looks.\\n\\n\r\nThe action of the series remains consistent enough. We can see that some of the adversaries throughout the series are truly dangerous and malevolent enough that only an organization such as Carneval itself can take them on directly. But even so, they sometimes struggle against them whether mentally or physically. In regards to the action, it is fluid and portrays the fantasy theme well. From the first episode, the acrobatic like movements of Tsukumo shows how capable she is. Then, there are the magic that gives off the fantasy vibes and more full throttle action with Gareki and his handy guns. The action is impressive enough to give the series a more serious mood when dealing with cases at least.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the beauty of Karneval makes up a large proportion through its visuals. The majestic feeling Karenval left me an impression of the show. The way the architectures are made in this series has that gothic feeling. The way the characters are dressed are also flamboyant especially Tsukumo and Gareki with their outfits. In my stances, the guys of this series are all dressed with a fancy style. Tsukmo is admired for her beauty, Gareki is dressed in a noticeable way, and Eva has that revealing style of fashion along with her straightforward personality. It's fan service in a way but in a more fancy style rather than the typical panty shots, up-skirts, etc.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the soundtrack of this show, Karneval stands out only at average here for me. I'm not exactly sure how the studios handled the OST but it's only noticeable during tense moments or when performances are out in the open. In other words, they only seem to stand out during prominent moments in the show rather than flowing properly. The OP song \"Henai no Rondo \"by GRANRODEO mixes in way with its fancy displays. Along with its ED song, \"REASON\" by KamiYU, both of these pieces of music works for the series. However, it's nothing special really, at least for me.\\n\\n\r\nIn all, Karneval is an example of a show that can be a hit or miss for fans. Its mystical atmosphere might not be something for avid fans of shounen action or other other genres to get used to. However, its beauty is expressed through its artwork and themes. Despite this though, I still find the story a bit blend and out of place. It lacks the way to make an impact by the construction of its narrative, its poorly made main male protagonist, and weak development. For me, this series is more of a poor dark horse that exceed some expectations but other times drops the ball. Well, that's just me but if you have some patience, Karneval sometimes does have its moments.",

            "content": "I wanted to like this show. Hand to God, really. It was probably one of the most visually unique programs I'd found in recent memory, and its commitment to the visual theme of a circus reminded me of Soul Eater's gothic design motifs in a refreshingly good way.\r\nBut having finished its (insofar) only season, I feel exhausted, and yet, content-wise, I feel grossly underfed.\r\nThe main problem is Karneval wants so badly to be a big, interesting anime with big mysterious overarching serial plot threads. It wants to do the FMA:B-esque slow, controlled, gradual reveal of information. All of its arcs (save for the one thatfinds Gareki revisiting his childhood home\u2014probably not coincidentally, the show's high watermark by a long shot), aim to pique the reader's curiosity about the mythos and the big picture first and foremost, but lose focus on being satisfying in the moment.\\n\\n\r\nSo, throughout its run, Karneval withholds exposition and lore from the viewer, thinking it's being tantalizing, but it crosses the line well into confounding.\\n\\n\r\nSo when it comes time to reap the benefits of all these seeds it had sown throughout the course of series\u2014at the cost of its episode-to-episode (or even arc-to-arc) quality and general enjoyability\u2014it fumbles. It simply can't cover them all. It shucks and weaves throughout a giant, chaotic battle climax to touch base on them, and satisfyingly concludes none of them. (Probably the most egregious offender is Nai's quest to find his old friend Karoku\u2014an incredibly enigmatic character, frequently teased by the narrative, whose role and character are both woefully underexplained, even by the show's end.)\\n\\n\r\nI haven't read the manga, but what this smacks of is a poor adaptation, biting off more source-material plotlines than the anime had room to chew. With its lack of conclusions, and so many balls still in the air, characters introduced to hardly ever be used, not to mention its too-optimistic sequel-begging final scenes, I feel like I just finished watching the pilot to a show, not its entire first year (and possibly its entire run).\\n\\n\r\nAnd sure, the visuals are amazing. The characters are fun to watch interact with each other, even if they are a little short on development (although, with a cast of 24 characters for a 13-episode series, it was inevitable some of them would have wound up a little undercooked\u2014again: overambitious source material selection). But all in all, I'd say unless there's something about the premise or the art that really speaks to you, getting invested in Karneval is primarily a discouraging venture.",

I only recently finished it and I'm already aching for more episodes. \r\nAt first, what may appeal to you and make you want to watch the show is the art. After all, it's very colorful, bright, and overall beautiful. It's enticing to say the least, and the first thing that hits you is probably how beautifully animated and drawn it is.\r\nAfter the outstanding art settles in, the characters and plot may seem lacking. It centers around Nai and Gareki; a dynamic duo who met by chance and chance alone. They're soonintertwined into a world of action and danger via Circus, a protection agency whose sole mission is to protect the world from the Varuga and Kafta. (You'll find out more about them throughout the show.) The two soon begin building friendships with some of Circus's members, such as with Yogi and Tsukumo. The show itself is very well paced for such a small amount of episodes. However, the show itself ended leaving a lot to be asked for and desired. Many questions were left unanswered, and that usually doesn't leave a good taste in your mouth, particularly with no promises of a future season. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is good. The opening and ending are cute enough and catchy as well. Most of the music and sfx fit well in the show, so I really can't complain.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I would give this show a watching. With only thirteen episodes, it's a shame if you don't. It's creative, mysterious, and all in all a good time. \\n\\n\r\nHappy Watching!",

            "content": "All flash, no substance. That's what I would say if I had to sum up my thoughts on Karneval.\r\nJust looking at it - either the promotional artwork, the first few scenes of the anime, or the manga artwork - you can easily tell that it's pretty. Characters are drawn in pleasing ways and colours are bright and sharp. The animation of the series is also very well done - everything moves smoothly, action scenes are generally well directed, and CG is used to great effect. I have to admit, even the soundtrack is pretty solid.\r\nThat's the flash I mentioned. In terms of substance, this iswhere Karneval suffers.\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with the plot. The story revolves a mysterious boy named Nai who encounters the thief, Gareki, and the defense organization, Circus, in his search for an even more mysterious man named Karoku. Through Circus, the two also get involved in fighting against a criminal organization by the name of Kafka.\\n\\n\r\nIt's quite straight forward, but for some reason, the anime goes through the motions of having a plot that's a lot more convoluted. For several episodes, antagonists seem to be plotting something or other, having to do with capturing Nai for whatever purpose, and in the meantime, Circus fights against human-like monstrosities; however, there is no direction or purpose for a long time. Random things just seem to happen inexplicably with no apparent end goal. Kafka as an organization doesn't even come to play until about the halfway point of the series, and even after the finale, I'm still uncertain just what Kafka's exact goals are.\\n\\n\r\nI have a feeling the writers were going for the approach wherein there's a mystery and tidbits of information are gradually given to the audience to heighten the anticipation and excitement. However, as I said, the plot of Karneval is actually quite straight-forward when laid bare, so the added convolution and vagueness makes it feel too confusing  for its own good. The worst of it is the whole search for Karoku. By the end of the series, he's even made a few appearances but we still have no idea who he is or why he's important.\\n\\n\r\nTo make matters worse is the issue of pacing. Karneval is 13 episodes long, which is relatively short when you have a plot involving mysterious organizations, plenty of action, and missing persons and lost identities to be found. This means that, ideally, every episode should count. However, Karenval squanders away good chunks of its time with having the cast go to parades, put on circus shows, or help a boy find a restaurant...or something.\\n\\n\r\nNow, this might all be a little forgivable if the characters were interesting. All right, they look great and, initially, they all seem really cool, but remember how I said \"All flash, no substance\"? Yeah, that again.\\n\\n\r\nAs the story progresses and each character gets their screen time, I came to realize that there was literally nothing original about any of them. Nai is innocent and cute, but ultimately weak and a crybaby. Gareki is the \"Jerk with a Heart of Gold\", the guy that doesn't like getting close to people but actually cares for them deep down inside. Also, for being a main character, he doesn't actually do a whole lot, something he actually realizes by the end. Tsukumo is sometimes hailed as a strong female character, and yeah, she can fight, but ultimately she's an emotionless, detached girl who isn't all that interesting. Yogi stands in contrast to Tsukumo - he's cheerful and bright, which is a nice breath of fresh air, but later on in the series, his continued exuberance and idealism make him more of a man-child and I found myself wishing we could see a different  aspect of him.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a number of other characters in the story, but they aren't given as much screen time as the main four and they, too, suffer from the same lack of depth and/or originality. It's really a shame because a number of them have the potential to grow into very interesting characters.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Karneval was a huge disappointment for me. Obviously, a lot of work and money was poured into this, but it was wasted on a cast of derived characters and a lacking plot.",

In fact it's probably one of the best well drawn adorable boys anime out there. \r\nI didn't notice the genre of the anime until the first few episodes when I decided to see where this anime was actually going. The anime's basically a common told story of a boy who has little memories, and his best friend Gareki tags along with him and they join a institution which fights evil. \r\nSimply put, the story's for people who want to stare at anadorable boy. The art is absolutely stunning, very high quality.\\n\r\nLooking at this anime from a holistic view, I wouldn't say it's great as it is mostly an anime for physical appeal rather than anything else. Nevertheless, the anime does fill its role of a pretty story with an average plot.  \\n\\n\r\nOn a side note, the anime has a great OP.",

            "content": "Where do I even start with Karneval. It's literally the most underrated anime in the world because it's so damn good, it could be Black Butler's brother from another mother. People always ask me \"What's that anime you keep crying about, what's the story line?\" And damn, that's my favorite question to answer.\r\nStory: Cute little Nai is looking for Karoku, and throughout the anime you keep wondering who the hell Karoku is and what the connection between them is. Then enter Gareki, the flawless tsundere bastard with the worst past ever, who robs rich people to support himself. He sees Nai's bracelet, which is aCircus ID. Enter Circus, a government organization that fights supernatural creatures named Varuga. Gareki and Nai go abroad the Circus ship, where they meet Yogi, Tsukumo, Akari and Hirato. Then shit goes down. \\n\r\nThe story line overall is amazing. At first I was a bit confused with all the supernatural going on, but as the anime goes on you get the hang of things and go along with the craziness of it all. It also follows very closely to the manga, so far from what I've read.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art differs from the manga because the characters are drawn a bit more blandly than the manga author drew them, which loses her personal touch to the art, but its in no way bad. The animation is great, the fight scenes are executed perfectly and the anime itself is so colorful it makes me very happy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Jesus Christ, ok. The characters are what get me in this anime. First of all, the main characters seem like they'd be the basic definitions of tsundere and yandere but there's so much more to them. Nai seems like a shota, with how clueless he is about a lot of things, but he's determined and you're going to find yourself very endeared by him. Gareki is a little tsundere prince who keeps going back and forth between decisions and the entire time he's having thoughts alone in his room you'll be biting your first rooting for him. It's really easy to get attached to this character. Yogi is a bit of a yandere but God, he's flawless. He's adorable and caring and his personality clashes with Gareki's but they work so well together. Tsukumo is adorable and at first it's hard to figure her out, but I got a special place in my heart for her. I could go on and on, but many of the characters tend to disprove your initial impression and your heart warms up to them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall enjoyment: I fell in love with this anime at the first episode. Literally. It sucks you in and you find yourself addicted. It is 100% worth watching or at least giving it a shot. If you like pretty animation, profound characters, a bit of supernatural along with good humour, you're going to love Karneval.",

            "content": "Karneval, I had high hopes seeing the logo and art style of the promotional banners, an interesting mix of cheery and gothic.  I was sad that the art didn't continue very much into the actual show further than the costuming of the circus agents.  The overall feel felt like a brighter version of D.Gray Man.  The story was interesting but could have used a little more thought and the characters were decent, (despite Nai's lack of a back bone driving me nuts) but the downfall was the work put into the dub.  I cringed every time the main cast entered thescene due to the poor casting of Nai and Gareki who both sounded forced and either below or above the actors' comfortable vocal range.  The script writing for the dub at first sounded like they were trying to be off-beat and interesting but eventually just looked lazy.  The maturity of language was inconsistent, ranging from Gareki saying b**** every other word one minute to awkward childish censorship the next.  Lines like \"Come on Buckaroo let's kick some tail!\" or \"Allergies, my left foot!\" or just the general use of the word \"whatevs,\" became more and more distracting and irritating as the show wore on.  All things considered it was average and worth a watch (maybe not a rewatch) and I hope a second season is in the wings, however, I won't be waiting on the edge of my seat.",

            "content": "I was going to wait until the last episode aired before writing this, but...I can't help it. I just had to write one now. Please note that this is my first review, so please bear with me. \r\nStory: 10/10\r\nWithout giving too much away, Karneval is about a young boy, Nai, who is looking for someone who was important to him\u2014in doing so, he gets himself captured. Gareki, a thief, finds him during a robbery and decides to rescue him. Then a series of events occur, blablabla, and they meet a defense organization known by the name Circus.\r\nI found the plot very original and interesting. Letme just say now that nearly every episode ended with a cliffhanger. A lot of people don't like cliffhangers, I know, but I personally love them. The point is to make you want to keep watching, right? Karneval certainly does the job with that. There are twists at every turn and I found myself rushing to the next episode. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork and animation in this anime is simply beautiful. It's lovely. Amazing. Breathtaking. I need better words. Hang on, let me grab a dictionary...just kidding. But honestly, this is some of the best art I've ever seen in an anime. The character designs are very nice, the backgrounds always catch my eye, and the art in the OP especially was very enjoyable. I don't know what else to say about this other than it's fantastic.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe music is also very good. I loved the OP. The ending didn't interest me as much, but that was okay. The soundtrack didn't stand out too much, but it did its job and added emotion to every scene. I approved of every voice actor\u2014they fit the characters well. Nai's came off as innocent like he was supposed to, Gareki's had the edge it needed, Togi's was humorous, etcetera.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of the only animes I've watched where I love almost every single character. You watch how they are in the beginning, and then you watch them grow and change. You get a chance to see every side and emotion to them, which is huge. Not a lot of animes do that. I absolutely adore Nai\u2014he's the sweetest and most honest little guy ever! I can't stand seeing him sad. Oh my gosh, I just want to hug him. Gareki is rough around the edges, but inside, he's a really caring person. Togi is absolutely hilarious; very lovable. I could go into detail, but I'd be giving spoilers. Basically, I just feel like I really know the characters. They really grow on you.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI wish I could rate this 1000000/10. Karneval is unmatched as my favorite anime. The combination of the incredible characters, the beautiful art, and the intense plot makes it impossible not to love. At first, I had my doubts about it (especially since you're kind of thrown into everything in the very beginning and you have no clue what's going on...but don't worry\u2014all your initial questions will be answered), but this definitely proved worth the while.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI highly, highly, highly recommend Karneval to anyone! It's very enjoyable and I am in love with it. Another aspect is how inspiring it is\u2014the friendship, strength, and determination of the characters never cease to move me.",

            "content": "After watching this anime, I can surely say that it is by far one of my favourites yet. This is one of the very few that I've enjoyed almost every, if not every single episode to the point that I had to absolutely binge it. I kept on putting myself off of the anime as I've been wanting to watch it for about a year or so, and I don't regret watching it at all... I kind of regret waiting this long, aha. Ironically, the reason that I decided to finally watch it was because I was looking for new inspiration to glisten up myaccount, and straight after the first episode, I loved it to pieces.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\r\nWhile the story may be confusing for some, I do admit that it can be, but to be fair, you have to have a very high- *coughs*\\n\r\n...sorry.\\n\r\nAs confusing as the story may be, the depth that the anime goes into basically blinds the confusion and treats the manga well.\\n\r\nIn the first minute of the first episode, you'll already question what you just discovered, but it'll sure get you hooked once you realise what happens.\\n\r\nThe amount of depth that gets put into characters to develop their own or others' persona is quite unique, and it always has a way to make it feel fresh and new: to make you feel happy or sad.\\n\r\nThe plot can simply be put into 5 words: Nai wants to find Karoku. But of course, it's much more complicated than that. Throughout the anime, new characters get introduced to develop mixed emotions towards the watcher and help the characters to grow in the present and to help us understand their past.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nI'm not really that appealed into art styles as I focus on everything else and my own personal enjoyment, but there are always some things that make me cherish that specific art style. Detail.\\n\r\nBy detail, I mean what makes the character look unique: accessories, outfits, hairstyle, body language... and the eyes.\\n\r\nEyes are the main factor when it comes to anime because of the emotions expressed through them and how diverse they can be. For example, I love Ciel's dark blue eyes due to how perfectly shaped they are with those appealing bottom eyelashes; Karneval is no exception. The mixture of colours used with the eyes is mesmerising.\\n\r\nThe outfits are absolutely beautiful and creative to the point that the outfits themselves serve as a substitute for the entire meals in Food Wars. I'm not even kidding. The outfits, especially Nai's, give me the same satisfaction of wanting to wear them. They are so diverse and are colour-coded absolutely perfectly, alongside the similarity of the eye and hair colour of many characters such as Karoku and Yogi to compliment the designs even further.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nTo begin with, the mandala in the OP is beautiful and so are the rectangular lights that scatter across the screen behind the pretty animated characters. I really like how the song is rock as I'm quite a fan of that. It's a really catchy song once you've listened to it a couple times. Plus, it's Granrodeo so what's not to love?\\n\r\nThe ED is so colourful and bright that it sometimes doesn't even match with the ending of a few episodes, but regardless the song is calming and mesmeric.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nI was very meticulous when it came to the characters, and they sure did something perfectly. Each character feels human, even the side characters that only get mentioned for a couple of episodes develop some sort of backstory for the main characters and bring sympathy to us watchers, such as the two twins developing Gareki's backstory even further. The small hints of Nai's abilities and persona really bring him out as a character that actually acts how they actually are to the point that it's smart yet absolutely adorable. With each character having some form of social weakness and a unique personality, plus the backstory of the characters and their reasoning, you could really make them feel special.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nWith some subtle areas of comedy and pureness, I just couldn't resist Nai. In every episode, I'd laugh at even the most minor things just because of how certain people reacted, such as Gareki talking all unenthusiastically in bright moments. And not to forget how cute Nai looks, I mean, just look at him.\\n\r\nI absolutely loved the plot, characters, and ideas. Almost everything unanswered was eventually answered throughout the anime. Every episode was a rollercoaster whether it be of joy, melancholy, or pure excitement.\\n\r\nThe only thing that disappointed me was the cliffhanger at the end with the Karoku theory, but I swear that must continue with a sequel.\\n\r\nSince the manga is still ongoing I'll read that while hoping for a second season. I'd rewatch it anytime without a doubt.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10",

The art just blew me away, watching characters fight (Spoiler; especially between Uro and Tsukumo) was just mind lowing,  very lean and elegant whilst also deadly. \r\nStory; The storyline is very interesting but sometimes there will be a lot of space between action. the story has this sort of air of mystery surrounding it, and you can never really be to sure if a character is evil or good, which makes it even more compelling. \r\nArt; The art is very happy, colourful and interesting. Alot of detail in every drawing and very clean. The characters were all drawn beautifully and having their clothes changed regularly was a welcome change. If anything, the art should definitely make you want to watch this, even if the characters are almost all \"bishounen\"\\n\\n\r\nSound; Thank god the main female characters don't have a high pitched cutesy voice! And Nai who is presented as a cute, young innocent male actually sounds like a boy. I was very impressed.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters; As aforementioned, each of the characters have depth and different personalities. The actual character development was very interesting to watch, whether it was Gareki struggling with where he fit into the picture, Nai learning about the world and growing up or Yogi getting stronger as he protects the people he lobes. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment; I couldn't stop watching this series and with the last episode coming out on the 27th of June I am so pumped! Whether it was the character development, the stunning fights or the simple fun of Circus, I couldn't stop watching.\\n\\n\r\nOverall i just want to say that this is fast becoming one of my favourite anime series. I can't wait to see how it finishes and I really hope there will be a second season. Fingers crossed!",

You will also enjoy every scene with the beautiful art. If you haven't watched it, then please do!",

The look, characters, mythology, story, it all works wonders for me. The best things about this anime is twofold. First, the animation is absolutely stunning. The colors are bright without being garish, and help with the atmosphere wonderfully. The character designs are also very well done on all fronts. This show has a very, very distinct look to it, which I appreciate. Secondly, the cast of characters is very solid. Theinteractions among them and subplots that result are written realistically and executed well. The story is somewhat thin, but the story isn't what really matters. If Hayao Miyazaki directed an anime, it would be Karneval. I would highly recommend.",

So much so that I am currently reading the manga. There was not a single sigh or eye roll during my watching.\r\nSTORY -9\r\nThe story it's self I rate a 9, mainly because it leaves you wanting more at the end and that it's humorous yet it still has a sufficient and some-what serious at times plot to keep one entertained.\r\nART -10\r\nI find that the characters themselves are animated beautifully and very close to the original manga. I find the backgrounds tobe well done too.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND -8\\n\r\nVoice actors did a fantastic job in Japanese (no dub yet) yet can be a little quiet at times. I found myself watching both the ending and the beginning music. The music through out the show gives off the right tone for that specific scene.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER -9\\n\r\nConsidering it is only 13 episodes of the main story in total the characters are pretty well done. There just isn't sufficient time to flesh every character like the manga is able to do. That is not to that they are left as empty shells so to speak but there may not be enough character development for the more picky viewer.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL -10\\n\r\nYou should watch it if you like to see beautiful characters and a colourful story. I have no complaints except that its short.",

I found myself loving the use of colours and also the contrast in colours when looking at characters. For example, Nai is blonde and usually dressed in light colours showing how pure he is, on the otherhand Gareki is always dressed in dark colours, creating this kind of mysterious air about him, we are constantly left thinking that Gareki is a pessimist, no matter the situation.\r\nOne thing that did displease me though was the fact that it was slightly predictable and Gareki, the character Ifell in love with, seemed to be the only character who was not 'special' in some sense. \\n\\n\r\nI suppose this created a more real feel to the anime as Gareki is constantly the normal and Nai is the strange. \\n\\n\r\nI expecially loved the character development and how the relationship between certain characters such as Nai and Gareki seemed to blossom through out.\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this to anyone, including a younger audience. For example I suggested this to my nine year old sister because it is borderline childish and simplistic but also interesting as well.",

I also liked the voice acting (English Dub), especial of Gareki and Nai. The latter is high and enjoying in some sense but fits the character really well.\r\nThe story is interesting and unlike any anime I have seen before. It\u2019s a combination of fantasy and science fiction. The characters work well together. This is especially true for Gareki and Nai. Nai seeks a really great friend in Gareki and doesn\u2019t want to leave his side to a point where Ithink he has separation anxiety. Gareki on the other hand seems really annoyed with Nai at first but likes him none the less whilst also wanting to protect him. I\u2019d say their relationship closely resembles that of a protective older brother and a na\u00efve but lovable little sibling.\\n\\n\r\nThe only problem I have with this series is that the story (referring to the anime) has a somewhat unsatisfactory open ending. From watching the anime, it feels like they were expecting there to be a second season, which unfortunately did not happen and probably never will.\\n\\n\r\nOver all I would recommend this anime but also strongly suggest being prepared to read the manga afterwards.\\n",

            "content": "A logical first impression when someone hears about \u201cKarneval\u201d and looks at the Cover Art: \r\n\u2022\t\u201cWow, Karneval! That\u2019s a really cute name! And look at the cover art! It looks like a party! Look at the main character! He looks so cute! This is going to be a totally cute and not-violent anime with lots of fun and partying!\u201d\r\nThat same person\u2019s impression after they watch the first episode:\r\n\u2022\t\u201cWh-What? Rape? Huh? Where are the parties? Why is everything so creepy? Why is there a serious, black-haired, yet crazy handsome kid holding a gun? What is that monster, why is it very graphically eating that man?! Ah!Confliction!\u201d \\n\\n\r\nNeedless to say, this anime is not what you think it is. If you want a cute little shoujo party anime, go to Shugo Chara. This anime gives off the impression of being cute, then you watch the first episode and you\u2019re conflicted on whether or not you want to continue to support that first impression. I mean, there are SOME cute party scenes that last for a few seconds, but there\u2019s a really dark thought behind these parties and it really has a darker plotline than one would expect. I\u2019m glad that I was surprised, actually. I think that having a darker plotline underneath the cute expectation really worked for it and added a bunch of refreshing juxtaposed elements. This anime really isn\u2019t for everybody, though. \\n\\n\r\nPlot: 5\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s an interesting plot: The story focuses on 2 boys. Gareki is a young, Lady-killing thief who steals money because he wants to (Insert Spoiler Here). He is really great with technology and has a hand for shooting. One day while he was robbing this rich house, he runs into Nai, our second protagonist. Nai is a really young boy, around 8, who claims to have no memory except for this one man named Karoku, who he claims was his caretaker, now missing. All he has left of Karoku now is a bracelet that is later identified as an identification band for a government sponsored combat organization that goes by the name of \u201cCircus.\u201d Somehow, both Gareki and Nai end up travelling together after almost being captured and killed by a monster. This monster is apparently one of the main targets of Circus and that leads to both Nai and Gareki getting held in custody of Circus for questioning and interrogation.\\n\\n\r\n The anime revolves around their adventures with the people they meet and the events that happen while they are tied up with Circus, who are using them to help unlock the mystery of these monsters. The plot is a very fun idea and there are a lot of cute friendship themes that pop up often. I\u2019m sorry to say this, because it was only a 13 episode anime, but everything seemed kind of rushed and there were a lot of scenes where nothing made any sense, eventually leading to an ending that just screwed with my entire mindset. There are a lot of holes in the anime; we never find out what happens to Karoku and the mystery behind the bracelet. The main goals of the characters are supposed to be what makes up the plot of this anime, but it fails in developing that and instead focuses on the development of the bonds b/w characters. It didn\u2019t make for a BAD anime, but it kind of left me unsatisfied in the end with a lot of questions still unanswered. Also, a lot of elements and somewhat significant plot elements seemed to be added last minute and explained with only 2 minutes left to go in the last episode of the anime. I guess I would be satisfied if there was another OV that aired to follow up on the unanswered questions, but there wasn\u2019t and in the end, everything ended up making fuck-all sense. I\u2019m very disappointed because I was really anxious; I knew this plot had potential, but it just wasn\u2019t put together well in the end. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\\n\r\nThe music was, at best, mediocre. I wasn\u2019t impressed with the opening or the OST, but there were times where the anime surprised me when pulling out a pretty solo during an emotional moment, which was satisfying. The ending was quite pretty and one of my favorite track in this anime. The voice acting was also good, but really, when isn\u2019t it?\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\\n\r\nI have to say for myself, the art for this anime was really beautiful. From the designs of the characters to the settings for the anime and the beautiful exchanges b/w the characters, everything was really pretty. The character designs were definitely my favorite part, though. The eyes of the characters were really colorful and each design was 10x different than the next. The designs also fit the characters\u2019 personalities very well. Nai was so fricking adorable and Gareki was really coolly designed. Everything that was supposed to be dark was dark; everything that was supposed to be fun was fun. I loved the contrast within the art styles too. The color and darkness was really interesting to look at. The only thing is, if you knew me at all, you\u2019d know that I\u2019m a sucker for good fight scenes in a shounen. This anime didn\u2019t have the fight scenes that I longed for. They were just mediocre, and for that, I dock a point. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were my favorite part of this anime. I fell in love with a lot of them, I grew to hate a lot of them. Some characters were amazingly likeable, like Nai. Nai was a fricking angel and his innocence conflicted the darkness and seriousness that was supposed to surround this anime. Sometimes, when done right, a child\u2019s innocent nature can really change the whole mood of the anime. Karneval did that really well. His design was adorable; his diction and attitude was even 10x more likeable, and that\u2019s why I grew to like him. He contrasted with Gareki\u2019s serious nature and that really helped with the whole reoccurring friendship thing. Opposites really do attract. Another character I really grew to love was Yogi. He was like an adult child and I loved it. He was a well-designed, well thought out comic relief that really relieved stress off of the constant depression that hitting me, wave after wave, in this anime. Those three characters were designed in genius. The one thing I didn\u2019t like is that there were WAY TOO MANY CHARACTERS!!! I never learned all of their names. You know that when a watcher can\u2019t learn all of the names, you added too many characters to count. Many of them added absolutely nothing to the anime. No comic relief, no added action, some of them sucked at fighting, it was ridiculous. There was very little character development in some serious protagonists, and even the antagonists had fuck all development. I never learned what happened to them! I never learned their secrets or their true intentions! That\u2019s not good.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\\n\r\nOkay, I\u2019m not lying when I say I like this anime. Sure, it was cute and fun to watch. I liked the episodes that didn\u2019t take themselves seriously; that was the show\u2019s strong point. The episodes where there was actually supposed to be \u201cplot development\u201d died. Many of them bored me and I longed for more \u201cunseriousness.\u201d I get that they were trying, but their attempts were unsuccessful. The plot was developed horribly, what else can I say? The development of relationships and connections were done really well though and that was what I enjoyed. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n",

            "content": "Karneval is a mysterious series. By mysterious, I don't entirely mean it being filled with clues to be solved by some detective. What I mean is how the series comes together through its plot, theme, and most importantly the characters of the mysterious 'Circus'. It spells out mystery in a variety of ways through fantasy and its elegant atmosphere. However, Karneval is one of those series that can be a hit or miss for potential viewers.\r\nThe anime series Karneval is based off the manga of the same named written by Touya Mikanagi. With 10 volumes and counting, the manga has received some attention, enough foran anime adaptation. So here we are, spring 2013 and the series makes it on to the screen for the very first time. \\n\\n\r\nTo me, Karneval is one of those shows where a variety of things happen, some at the same time. The series has that fantasy background with majestic themes. The series focuses on a mysterious group known as the \u201cCircus\u201d. The way they dress seems to fit within this theme but their actions are a bit different. For a variety of reasons, this organization serves a protection force. In other words, they work to ensure that the safety of its people are guaranteed. To do things, it seems that its members relies on teamwork, magic, strategies, and even acrobat movements. It enforces the fact that its members are skilled enough for the task. Of course though, these tasks often puts its members of Circus' lives at risks. There is danger ranging from armed kidnappers to mysterious creatures. Among other factors, the members themselves sometimes has internal factors that prevents them from accomplishing tasks at their best. But at any rate, this mysterious group known as Circus is the drive force behind the series.\\n\\n\r\nTwo of the most prominent members associated Circus are Nai and Gareki. There is a lot of mystery going on between these two characters. For one, we learn that Nai is searching for something important. After a dangerous incident, he meets Gareki who saves his life. And here becomes their little adventure as Nai and Gareki becomes friends. On the surface, the two seems to get along but their characters' basis contrasts greatly in comparisons. Nai is portrayed as a boy who is often feels like he is a loner along with feelings of cowardliness around certain situations. We can tell by his face expressions that he is quite nervous throughout each episode. On the opposite of the coin, there's Gareki. His expressions gives off a confident, rough, and sometimes arrogant atmosphere. He is also seen as fearless in many situations and doesn't hesitant to speak his mind to make the first move. Although they seem so different, the two becomes a compatible duo; in a rather peculiar fashion.\\n\\n\r\nThe majority of the supporting characters makes up the 'Carneval'. All of them seems to have specialized skills to handle various situations. For example, there is the beautiful and well respected girl Tsukumo who is skilled in acrobatics and is able to take down foes with a calm mind. There's also Yogi, a cheerful young man who is able to evoke fear through his magic. Then, there's the Hirato, the Second Ships' captain with a mind of intellect capable of managing the team through various tasks. The point is that Carneval takes on challenges fearlessly and with precision to ensure its success. They work for the government and takes out the most dangerous individuals out of their world to ensure a place without fear. On the other hand exists another organization, one that opposes Carneval for their actions known as Kafka. They are even more mysterious as we know nearly nothing about them besides that they oppose the government and conducts in illegal activities. Yup, here it is again, mystery...\\n\\n\r\nThe story of this anime adapted series is a bit difficult to comprehend. In fact, some fans may be confused to what's going on that may lead to a scratch on their heads. I'll say it out straight: the story is a bit blend and requires a bit of focus to enjoy Karneval at its fullest. Apparently, Nai used to be an acquittance or possible friend of a mysterious young man named Karoku. The accessory (bracelet) is a proof of his past relationship with him. Throughout the series, we also see Karoku make screen appearances but have little clue to his true origin or identity. Speaking of which, Nai's own identity is a puzzle throughout the series as well. His name literally means 'nothing' in English. The way he looks also makes the boy seems quite feminine and his nervousness doesn't help him shape into a more masculine image. He often has to rely on others whether it's the tough bad boy Gareki or members of Circus. This makes the main male protagonist Nai a bit hard to appreciate or respect. He hardly develops throughout the series and becomes more frustrating to watch each episode as the only way he can achieve tasks is with the help of others. There's an old saying that goes 'if you want something done right, do it yourself'. Nai is nowhere near that philosophy yet and becomes a pain to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThere's also some confusion related to the other characters as the atmosphere of the show seems to be quite slow paced. Furthermore, it's even sometimes difficult to tell who the real antagonists are. Needless to say, the construction of the characters along with the plot are blend and hard to appreciate. On the bright side though, the action of this series flows quite well with the movements of its characters. Speaking of which, the characters' designs are elegant and beautiful. Tsukumo can be seen as a mascot for this series by the way she is dressed. Then, there are the guys like Gareki and Yogi who gives off an impression with their good looks.\\n\\n\r\nThe action of the series remains consistent enough. We can see that some of the adversaries throughout the series are truly dangerous and malevolent enough that only an organization such as Carneval itself can take them on directly. But even so, they sometimes struggle against them whether mentally or physically. In regards to the action, it is fluid and portrays the fantasy theme well. From the first episode, the acrobatic like movements of Tsukumo shows how capable she is. Then, there are the magic that gives off the fantasy vibes and more full throttle action with Gareki and his handy guns. The action is impressive enough to give the series a more serious mood when dealing with cases at least.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the beauty of Karneval makes up a large proportion through its visuals. The majestic feeling Karenval left me an impression of the show. The way the architectures are made in this series has that gothic feeling. The way the characters are dressed are also flamboyant especially Tsukumo and Gareki with their outfits. In my stances, the guys of this series are all dressed with a fancy style. Tsukmo is admired for her beauty, Gareki is dressed in a noticeable way, and Eva has that revealing style of fashion along with her straightforward personality. It's fan service in a way but in a more fancy style rather than the typical panty shots, up-skirts, etc.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the soundtrack of this show, Karneval stands out only at average here for me. I'm not exactly sure how the studios handled the OST but it's only noticeable during tense moments or when performances are out in the open. In other words, they only seem to stand out during prominent moments in the show rather than flowing properly. The OP song \"Henai no Rondo \"by GRANRODEO mixes in way with its fancy displays. Along with its ED song, \"REASON\" by KamiYU, both of these pieces of music works for the series. However, it's nothing special really, at least for me.\\n\\n\r\nIn all, Karneval is an example of a show that can be a hit or miss for fans. Its mystical atmosphere might not be something for avid fans of shounen action or other other genres to get used to. However, its beauty is expressed through its artwork and themes. Despite this though, I still find the story a bit blend and out of place. It lacks the way to make an impact by the construction of its narrative, its poorly made main male protagonist, and weak development. For me, this series is more of a poor dark horse that exceed some expectations but other times drops the ball. Well, that's just me but if you have some patience, Karneval sometimes does have its moments.",

            "content": "I wanted to like this show. Hand to God, really. It was probably one of the most visually unique programs I'd found in recent memory, and its commitment to the visual theme of a circus reminded me of Soul Eater's gothic design motifs in a refreshingly good way.\r\nBut having finished its (insofar) only season, I feel exhausted, and yet, content-wise, I feel grossly underfed.\r\nThe main problem is Karneval wants so badly to be a big, interesting anime with big mysterious overarching serial plot threads. It wants to do the FMA:B-esque slow, controlled, gradual reveal of information. All of its arcs (save for the one thatfinds Gareki revisiting his childhood home\u2014probably not coincidentally, the show's high watermark by a long shot), aim to pique the reader's curiosity about the mythos and the big picture first and foremost, but lose focus on being satisfying in the moment.\\n\\n\r\nSo, throughout its run, Karneval withholds exposition and lore from the viewer, thinking it's being tantalizing, but it crosses the line well into confounding.\\n\\n\r\nSo when it comes time to reap the benefits of all these seeds it had sown throughout the course of series\u2014at the cost of its episode-to-episode (or even arc-to-arc) quality and general enjoyability\u2014it fumbles. It simply can't cover them all. It shucks and weaves throughout a giant, chaotic battle climax to touch base on them, and satisfyingly concludes none of them. (Probably the most egregious offender is Nai's quest to find his old friend Karoku\u2014an incredibly enigmatic character, frequently teased by the narrative, whose role and character are both woefully underexplained, even by the show's end.)\\n\\n\r\nI haven't read the manga, but what this smacks of is a poor adaptation, biting off more source-material plotlines than the anime had room to chew. With its lack of conclusions, and so many balls still in the air, characters introduced to hardly ever be used, not to mention its too-optimistic sequel-begging final scenes, I feel like I just finished watching the pilot to a show, not its entire first year (and possibly its entire run).\\n\\n\r\nAnd sure, the visuals are amazing. The characters are fun to watch interact with each other, even if they are a little short on development (although, with a cast of 24 characters for a 13-episode series, it was inevitable some of them would have wound up a little undercooked\u2014again: overambitious source material selection). But all in all, I'd say unless there's something about the premise or the art that really speaks to you, getting invested in Karneval is primarily a discouraging venture.",

I only recently finished it and I'm already aching for more episodes. \r\nAt first, what may appeal to you and make you want to watch the show is the art. After all, it's very colorful, bright, and overall beautiful. It's enticing to say the least, and the first thing that hits you is probably how beautifully animated and drawn it is.\r\nAfter the outstanding art settles in, the characters and plot may seem lacking. It centers around Nai and Gareki; a dynamic duo who met by chance and chance alone. They're soonintertwined into a world of action and danger via Circus, a protection agency whose sole mission is to protect the world from the Varuga and Kafta. (You'll find out more about them throughout the show.) The two soon begin building friendships with some of Circus's members, such as with Yogi and Tsukumo. The show itself is very well paced for such a small amount of episodes. However, the show itself ended leaving a lot to be asked for and desired. Many questions were left unanswered, and that usually doesn't leave a good taste in your mouth, particularly with no promises of a future season. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is good. The opening and ending are cute enough and catchy as well. Most of the music and sfx fit well in the show, so I really can't complain.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I would give this show a watching. With only thirteen episodes, it's a shame if you don't. It's creative, mysterious, and all in all a good time. \\n\\n\r\nHappy Watching!",

            "content": "All flash, no substance. That's what I would say if I had to sum up my thoughts on Karneval.\r\nJust looking at it - either the promotional artwork, the first few scenes of the anime, or the manga artwork - you can easily tell that it's pretty. Characters are drawn in pleasing ways and colours are bright and sharp. The animation of the series is also very well done - everything moves smoothly, action scenes are generally well directed, and CG is used to great effect. I have to admit, even the soundtrack is pretty solid.\r\nThat's the flash I mentioned. In terms of substance, this iswhere Karneval suffers.\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with the plot. The story revolves a mysterious boy named Nai who encounters the thief, Gareki, and the defense organization, Circus, in his search for an even more mysterious man named Karoku. Through Circus, the two also get involved in fighting against a criminal organization by the name of Kafka.\\n\\n\r\nIt's quite straight forward, but for some reason, the anime goes through the motions of having a plot that's a lot more convoluted. For several episodes, antagonists seem to be plotting something or other, having to do with capturing Nai for whatever purpose, and in the meantime, Circus fights against human-like monstrosities; however, there is no direction or purpose for a long time. Random things just seem to happen inexplicably with no apparent end goal. Kafka as an organization doesn't even come to play until about the halfway point of the series, and even after the finale, I'm still uncertain just what Kafka's exact goals are.\\n\\n\r\nI have a feeling the writers were going for the approach wherein there's a mystery and tidbits of information are gradually given to the audience to heighten the anticipation and excitement. However, as I said, the plot of Karneval is actually quite straight-forward when laid bare, so the added convolution and vagueness makes it feel too confusing  for its own good. The worst of it is the whole search for Karoku. By the end of the series, he's even made a few appearances but we still have no idea who he is or why he's important.\\n\\n\r\nTo make matters worse is the issue of pacing. Karneval is 13 episodes long, which is relatively short when you have a plot involving mysterious organizations, plenty of action, and missing persons and lost identities to be found. This means that, ideally, every episode should count. However, Karenval squanders away good chunks of its time with having the cast go to parades, put on circus shows, or help a boy find a restaurant...or something.\\n\\n\r\nNow, this might all be a little forgivable if the characters were interesting. All right, they look great and, initially, they all seem really cool, but remember how I said \"All flash, no substance\"? Yeah, that again.\\n\\n\r\nAs the story progresses and each character gets their screen time, I came to realize that there was literally nothing original about any of them. Nai is innocent and cute, but ultimately weak and a crybaby. Gareki is the \"Jerk with a Heart of Gold\", the guy that doesn't like getting close to people but actually cares for them deep down inside. Also, for being a main character, he doesn't actually do a whole lot, something he actually realizes by the end. Tsukumo is sometimes hailed as a strong female character, and yeah, she can fight, but ultimately she's an emotionless, detached girl who isn't all that interesting. Yogi stands in contrast to Tsukumo - he's cheerful and bright, which is a nice breath of fresh air, but later on in the series, his continued exuberance and idealism make him more of a man-child and I found myself wishing we could see a different  aspect of him.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a number of other characters in the story, but they aren't given as much screen time as the main four and they, too, suffer from the same lack of depth and/or originality. It's really a shame because a number of them have the potential to grow into very interesting characters.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Karneval was a huge disappointment for me. Obviously, a lot of work and money was poured into this, but it was wasted on a cast of derived characters and a lacking plot.",

Unfortunately I haven't been able to find any US English versions of the volumes (Scanlations not included). I think I will probably just buy themfrom Madman. I'm buying the Blu-rays, which have English subs from Amazon Japan and I look forward to their arrival. I can't wait to continue such a great story. The show captivates me.

But they did it right away, and it didn't effect as much as it should be. But there's a girl that really effected her, which is great but the others didn't effect them at all. So the way they develop things are bad. \\n\\n\r\nI really don't mind two guys feeling pretty enough to chillin' with each other, the way that Karneval did or develop there characters to a relationships between two guys or three.

If there's any, then you should've find another guy as you are, to resembles the meaning of BFF. Just sayin'. If you've find one, then you have the right to be a character on Karneval. That's why Karneval's characters resembles girls dream ( which is two guys caring about each other ALL THE TIME).

People always ask me \"What's that anime you keep crying about, what's the story line?\" And damn, that's my favorite question to answer.\r\nStory: Cute little Nai is looking for Karoku, and throughout the anime you keep wondering who the hell Karoku is and what the connection between them is. Then enter Gareki, the flawless tsundere bastard with the worst past ever, who robs rich people to support himself. He sees Nai's bracelet, which is aCircus ID. Enter Circus, a government organization that fights supernatural creatures named Varuga. Gareki and Nai go abroad the Circus ship, where they meet Yogi, Tsukumo, Akari and Hirato. Then shit goes down. \\n\r\nThe story line overall is amazing. At first I was a bit confused with all the supernatural going on, but as the anime goes on you get the hang of things and go along with the craziness of it all. It also follows very closely to the manga, so far from what I've read.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art differs from the manga because the characters are drawn a bit more blandly than the manga author drew them, which loses her personal touch to the art, but its in no way bad. The animation is great, the fight scenes are executed perfectly and the anime itself is so colorful it makes me very happy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Jesus Christ, ok. The characters are what get me in this anime. First of all, the main characters seem like they'd be the basic definitions of tsundere and yandere but there's so much more to them. Nai seems like a shota, with how clueless he is about a lot of things, but he's determined and you're going to find yourself very endeared by him. Gareki is a little tsundere prince who keeps going back and forth between decisions and the entire time he's having thoughts alone in his room you'll be biting your first rooting for him. It's really easy to get attached to this character. Yogi is a bit of a yandere but God, he's flawless. He's adorable and caring and his personality clashes with Gareki's but they work so well together. Tsukumo is adorable and at first it's hard to figure her out, but I got a special place in my heart for her. I could go on and on, but many of the characters tend to disprove your initial impression and your heart warms up to them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall enjoyment: I fell in love with this anime at the first episode. Literally. It sucks you in and you find yourself addicted. It is 100% worth watching or at least giving it a shot. If you like pretty animation, profound characters, a bit of supernatural along with good humour, you're going to love Karneval.",

            "content": "Karneval, I had high hopes seeing the logo and art style of the promotional banners, an interesting mix of cheery and gothic.  I was sad that the art didn't continue very much into the actual show further than the costuming of the circus agents.  The overall feel felt like a brighter version of D.Gray Man.  The story was interesting but could have used a little more thought and the characters were decent, (despite Nai's lack of a back bone driving me nuts) but the downfall was the work put into the dub.  I cringed every time the main cast entered thescene due to the poor casting of Nai and Gareki who both sounded forced and either below or above the actors' comfortable vocal range.  The script writing for the dub at first sounded like they were trying to be off-beat and interesting but eventually just looked lazy.  The maturity of language was inconsistent, ranging from Gareki saying b**** every other word one minute to awkward childish censorship the next.  Lines like \"Come on Buckaroo let's kick some tail!\" or \"Allergies, my left foot!\" or just the general use of the word \"whatevs,\" became more and more distracting and irritating as the show wore on.  All things considered it was average and worth a watch (maybe not a rewatch) and I hope a second season is in the wings, however, I won't be waiting on the edge of my seat.",

            "content": "I was going to wait until the last episode aired before writing this, but...I can't help it. I just had to write one now. Please note that this is my first review, so please bear with me. \r\nStory: 10/10\r\nWithout giving too much away, Karneval is about a young boy, Nai, who is looking for someone who was important to him\u2014in doing so, he gets himself captured. Gareki, a thief, finds him during a robbery and decides to rescue him. Then a series of events occur, blablabla, and they meet a defense organization known by the name Circus.\r\nI found the plot very original and interesting. Letme just say now that nearly every episode ended with a cliffhanger. A lot of people don't like cliffhangers, I know, but I personally love them. The point is to make you want to keep watching, right? Karneval certainly does the job with that. There are twists at every turn and I found myself rushing to the next episode. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork and animation in this anime is simply beautiful. It's lovely. Amazing. Breathtaking. I need better words. Hang on, let me grab a dictionary...just kidding. But honestly, this is some of the best art I've ever seen in an anime. The character designs are very nice, the backgrounds always catch my eye, and the art in the OP especially was very enjoyable. I don't know what else to say about this other than it's fantastic.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe music is also very good. I loved the OP. The ending didn't interest me as much, but that was okay. The soundtrack didn't stand out too much, but it did its job and added emotion to every scene. I approved of every voice actor\u2014they fit the characters well. Nai's came off as innocent like he was supposed to, Gareki's had the edge it needed, Togi's was humorous, etcetera.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of the only animes I've watched where I love almost every single character. You watch how they are in the beginning, and then you watch them grow and change. You get a chance to see every side and emotion to them, which is huge. Not a lot of animes do that. I absolutely adore Nai\u2014he's the sweetest and most honest little guy ever! I can't stand seeing him sad. Oh my gosh, I just want to hug him. Gareki is rough around the edges, but inside, he's a really caring person. Togi is absolutely hilarious; very lovable. I could go into detail, but I'd be giving spoilers. Basically, I just feel like I really know the characters. They really grow on you.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI wish I could rate this 1000000/10. Karneval is unmatched as my favorite anime. The combination of the incredible characters, the beautiful art, and the intense plot makes it impossible not to love. At first, I had my doubts about it (especially since you're kind of thrown into everything in the very beginning and you have no clue what's going on...but don't worry\u2014all your initial questions will be answered), but this definitely proved worth the while.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI highly, highly, highly recommend Karneval to anyone! It's very enjoyable and I am in love with it. Another aspect is how inspiring it is\u2014the friendship, strength, and determination of the characters never cease to move me.",

            "content": "After watching this anime, I can surely say that it is by far one of my favourites yet. This is one of the very few that I've enjoyed almost every, if not every single episode to the point that I had to absolutely binge it. I kept on putting myself off of the anime as I've been wanting to watch it for about a year or so, and I don't regret watching it at all... I kind of regret waiting this long, aha. Ironically, the reason that I decided to finally watch it was because I was looking for new inspiration to glisten up myaccount, and straight after the first episode, I loved it to pieces.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\r\nWhile the story may be confusing for some, I do admit that it can be, but to be fair, you have to have a very high- *coughs*\\n\r\n...sorry.\\n\r\nAs confusing as the story may be, the depth that the anime goes into basically blinds the confusion and treats the manga well.\\n\r\nIn the first minute of the first episode, you'll already question what you just discovered, but it'll sure get you hooked once you realise what happens.\\n\r\nThe amount of depth that gets put into characters to develop their own or others' persona is quite unique, and it always has a way to make it feel fresh and new: to make you feel happy or sad.\\n\r\nThe plot can simply be put into 5 words: Nai wants to find Karoku. But of course, it's much more complicated than that. Throughout the anime, new characters get introduced to develop mixed emotions towards the watcher and help the characters to grow in the present and to help us understand their past.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nI'm not really that appealed into art styles as I focus on everything else and my own personal enjoyment, but there are always some things that make me cherish that specific art style. Detail.\\n\r\nBy detail, I mean what makes the character look unique: accessories, outfits, hairstyle, body language... and the eyes.\\n\r\nEyes are the main factor when it comes to anime because of the emotions expressed through them and how diverse they can be. For example, I love Ciel's dark blue eyes due to how perfectly shaped they are with those appealing bottom eyelashes; Karneval is no exception. The mixture of colours used with the eyes is mesmerising.\\n\r\nThe outfits are absolutely beautiful and creative to the point that the outfits themselves serve as a substitute for the entire meals in Food Wars. I'm not even kidding. The outfits, especially Nai's, give me the same satisfaction of wanting to wear them. They are so diverse and are colour-coded absolutely perfectly, alongside the similarity of the eye and hair colour of many characters such as Karoku and Yogi to compliment the designs even further.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nTo begin with, the mandala in the OP is beautiful and so are the rectangular lights that scatter across the screen behind the pretty animated characters. I really like how the song is rock as I'm quite a fan of that. It's a really catchy song once you've listened to it a couple times. Plus, it's Granrodeo so what's not to love?\\n\r\nThe ED is so colourful and bright that it sometimes doesn't even match with the ending of a few episodes, but regardless the song is calming and mesmeric.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nI was very meticulous when it came to the characters, and they sure did something perfectly. Each character feels human, even the side characters that only get mentioned for a couple of episodes develop some sort of backstory for the main characters and bring sympathy to us watchers, such as the two twins developing Gareki's backstory even further. The small hints of Nai's abilities and persona really bring him out as a character that actually acts how they actually are to the point that it's smart yet absolutely adorable. With each character having some form of social weakness and a unique personality, plus the backstory of the characters and their reasoning, you could really make them feel special.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nWith some subtle areas of comedy and pureness, I just couldn't resist Nai. In every episode, I'd laugh at even the most minor things just because of how certain people reacted, such as Gareki talking all unenthusiastically in bright moments. And not to forget how cute Nai looks, I mean, just look at him.\\n\r\nI absolutely loved the plot, characters, and ideas. Almost everything unanswered was eventually answered throughout the anime. Every episode was a rollercoaster whether it be of joy, melancholy, or pure excitement.\\n\r\nThe only thing that disappointed me was the cliffhanger at the end with the Karoku theory, but I swear that must continue with a sequel.\\n\r\nSince the manga is still ongoing I'll read that while hoping for a second season. I'd rewatch it anytime without a doubt.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10",

            "content": "Karneval is an amazing series. Almost all the characters have good depth and a sad/interesting back story or feature. The art just blew me away, watching characters fight (Spoiler; especially between Uro and Tsukumo) was just mind lowing,  very lean and elegant whilst also deadly. \r\nStory; The storyline is very interesting but sometimes there will be a lot of space between action. the story has this sort of air of mystery surrounding it, and you can never really be to sure if a character is evil or good, which makes it even more compelling. \r\nArt; The art is very happy, colourful and interesting. Alot of detail in every drawing and very clean. The characters were all drawn beautifully and having their clothes changed regularly was a welcome change. If anything, the art should definitely make you want to watch this, even if the characters are almost all \"bishounen\"\\n\\n\r\nSound; Thank god the main female characters don't have a high pitched cutesy voice! And Nai who is presented as a cute, young innocent male actually sounds like a boy. I was very impressed.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters; As aforementioned, each of the characters have depth and different personalities. The actual character development was very interesting to watch, whether it was Gareki struggling with where he fit into the picture, Nai learning about the world and growing up or Yogi getting stronger as he protects the people he lobes. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment; I couldn't stop watching this series and with the last episode coming out on the 27th of June I am so pumped! Whether it was the character development, the stunning fights or the simple fun of Circus, I couldn't stop watching.\\n\\n\r\nOverall i just want to say that this is fast becoming one of my favourite anime series. I can't wait to see how it finishes and I really hope there will be a second season. Fingers crossed!",

Now as I have seen many negative comments on how slow the story was in the episodes, I will say now: why base this wonderful anime off how they choose to advance the story? \r\nThis anime was mainly one of mystery and fantasy, so ifyou are a fan of Kuroshitsuji, D-Gray Man, or Arcana Famiglia, you will enjoy this story greatly. You will also enjoy every scene with the beautiful art. If you haven't watched it, then please do!",

The look, characters, mythology, story, it all works wonders for me. The best things about this anime is twofold. First, the animation is absolutely stunning. The colors are bright without being garish, and help with the atmosphere wonderfully. The character designs are also very well done on all fronts. This show has a very, very distinct look to it, which I appreciate. Secondly, the cast of characters is very solid. Theinteractions among them and subplots that result are written realistically and executed well. The story is somewhat thin, but the story isn't what really matters. If Hayao Miyazaki directed an anime, it would be Karneval. I would highly recommend.",

So much so that I am currently reading the manga. There was not a single sigh or eye roll during my watching.\r\nSTORY -9\r\nThe story it's self I rate a 9, mainly because it leaves you wanting more at the end and that it's humorous yet it still has a sufficient and some-what serious at times plot to keep one entertained.\r\nART -10\r\nI find that the characters themselves are animated beautifully and very close to the original manga. I find the backgrounds tobe well done too.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND -8\\n\r\nVoice actors did a fantastic job in Japanese (no dub yet) yet can be a little quiet at times. I found myself watching both the ending and the beginning music. The music through out the show gives off the right tone for that specific scene.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER -9\\n\r\nConsidering it is only 13 episodes of the main story in total the characters are pretty well done. There just isn't sufficient time to flesh every character like the manga is able to do. That is not to that they are left as empty shells so to speak but there may not be enough character development for the more picky viewer.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL -10\\n\r\nYou should watch it if you like to see beautiful characters and a colourful story. I have no complaints except that its short.",

I found myself loving the use of colours and also the contrast in colours when looking at characters. For example, Nai is blonde and usually dressed in light colours showing how pure he is, on the otherhand Gareki is always dressed in dark colours, creating this kind of mysterious air about him, we are constantly left thinking that Gareki is a pessimist, no matter the situation.\r\nOne thing that did displease me though was the fact that it was slightly predictable and Gareki, the character Ifell in love with, seemed to be the only character who was not 'special' in some sense. \\n\\n\r\nI suppose this created a more real feel to the anime as Gareki is constantly the normal and Nai is the strange. \\n\\n\r\nI expecially loved the character development and how the relationship between certain characters such as Nai and Gareki seemed to blossom through out.\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this to anyone, including a younger audience. For example I suggested this to my nine year old sister because it is borderline childish and simplistic but also interesting as well.",

            "content": "The character design and the art style in general is great. It has the perfect balance between beautiful colorful scenes and well riveting dark sequences. I also liked the voice acting (English Dub), especial of Gareki and Nai. The latter is high and enjoying in some sense but fits the character really well.\r\nThe story is interesting and unlike any anime I have seen before. It\u2019s a combination of fantasy and science fiction. The characters work well together. This is especially true for Gareki and Nai. Nai seeks a really great friend in Gareki and doesn\u2019t want to leave his side to a point where Ithink he has separation anxiety. Gareki on the other hand seems really annoyed with Nai at first but likes him none the less whilst also wanting to protect him. I\u2019d say their relationship closely resembles that of a protective older brother and a na\u00efve but lovable little sibling.\\n\\n\r\nThe only problem I have with this series is that the story (referring to the anime) has a somewhat unsatisfactory open ending. From watching the anime, it feels like they were expecting there to be a second season, which unfortunately did not happen and probably never will.\\n\\n\r\nOver all I would recommend this anime but also strongly suggest being prepared to read the manga afterwards.\\n",

And in this anime the plot is pathetic, it is so very boring and predictable. There is absolutely nothing to think about, just a collection of pretty pictures. The worst part is you get hooked and watch the next episode because you want to find something interesting and mysterious to think about, but the next episode is just random dialog and flashy scenes.",

            "content": "A logical first impression when someone hears about \u201cKarneval\u201d and looks at the Cover Art: \r\n\u2022\t\u201cWow, Karneval! That\u2019s a really cute name! And look at the cover art! It looks like a party! Look at the main character! He looks so cute! This is going to be a totally cute and not-violent anime with lots of fun and partying!\u201d\r\nThat same person\u2019s impression after they watch the first episode:\r\n\u2022\t\u201cWh-What? Rape? Huh? Where are the parties? Why is everything so creepy? Why is there a serious, black-haired, yet crazy handsome kid holding a gun? What is that monster, why is it very graphically eating that man?! Ah!Confliction!\u201d \\n\\n\r\nNeedless to say, this anime is not what you think it is. If you want a cute little shoujo party anime, go to Shugo Chara. This anime gives off the impression of being cute, then you watch the first episode and you\u2019re conflicted on whether or not you want to continue to support that first impression. I mean, there are SOME cute party scenes that last for a few seconds, but there\u2019s a really dark thought behind these parties and it really has a darker plotline than one would expect. I\u2019m glad that I was surprised, actually. I think that having a darker plotline underneath the cute expectation really worked for it and added a bunch of refreshing juxtaposed elements. This anime really isn\u2019t for everybody, though. \\n\\n\r\nPlot: 5\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s an interesting plot: The story focuses on 2 boys. Gareki is a young, Lady-killing thief who steals money because he wants to (Insert Spoiler Here). He is really great with technology and has a hand for shooting. One day while he was robbing this rich house, he runs into Nai, our second protagonist. Nai is a really young boy, around 8, who claims to have no memory except for this one man named Karoku, who he claims was his caretaker, now missing. All he has left of Karoku now is a bracelet that is later identified as an identification band for a government sponsored combat organization that goes by the name of \u201cCircus.\u201d Somehow, both Gareki and Nai end up travelling together after almost being captured and killed by a monster. This monster is apparently one of the main targets of Circus and that leads to both Nai and Gareki getting held in custody of Circus for questioning and interrogation.\\n\\n\r\n The anime revolves around their adventures with the people they meet and the events that happen while they are tied up with Circus, who are using them to help unlock the mystery of these monsters. The plot is a very fun idea and there are a lot of cute friendship themes that pop up often. I\u2019m sorry to say this, because it was only a 13 episode anime, but everything seemed kind of rushed and there were a lot of scenes where nothing made any sense, eventually leading to an ending that just screwed with my entire mindset. There are a lot of holes in the anime; we never find out what happens to Karoku and the mystery behind the bracelet. The main goals of the characters are supposed to be what makes up the plot of this anime, but it fails in developing that and instead focuses on the development of the bonds b/w characters. It didn\u2019t make for a BAD anime, but it kind of left me unsatisfied in the end with a lot of questions still unanswered. Also, a lot of elements and somewhat significant plot elements seemed to be added last minute and explained with only 2 minutes left to go in the last episode of the anime. I guess I would be satisfied if there was another OV that aired to follow up on the unanswered questions, but there wasn\u2019t and in the end, everything ended up making fuck-all sense. I\u2019m very disappointed because I was really anxious; I knew this plot had potential, but it just wasn\u2019t put together well in the end. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\\n\r\nThe music was, at best, mediocre. I wasn\u2019t impressed with the opening or the OST, but there were times where the anime surprised me when pulling out a pretty solo during an emotional moment, which was satisfying. The ending was quite pretty and one of my favorite track in this anime. The voice acting was also good, but really, when isn\u2019t it?\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\\n\r\nI have to say for myself, the art for this anime was really beautiful. From the designs of the characters to the settings for the anime and the beautiful exchanges b/w the characters, everything was really pretty. The character designs were definitely my favorite part, though. The eyes of the characters were really colorful and each design was 10x different than the next. The designs also fit the characters\u2019 personalities very well. Nai was so fricking adorable and Gareki was really coolly designed. Everything that was supposed to be dark was dark; everything that was supposed to be fun was fun. I loved the contrast within the art styles too. The color and darkness was really interesting to look at. The only thing is, if you knew me at all, you\u2019d know that I\u2019m a sucker for good fight scenes in a shounen. This anime didn\u2019t have the fight scenes that I longed for. They were just mediocre, and for that, I dock a point. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were my favorite part of this anime. I fell in love with a lot of them, I grew to hate a lot of them. Some characters were amazingly likeable, like Nai. Nai was a fricking angel and his innocence conflicted the darkness and seriousness that was supposed to surround this anime. Sometimes, when done right, a child\u2019s innocent nature can really change the whole mood of the anime. Karneval did that really well. His design was adorable; his diction and attitude was even 10x more likeable, and that\u2019s why I grew to like him. He contrasted with Gareki\u2019s serious nature and that really helped with the whole reoccurring friendship thing. Opposites really do attract. Another character I really grew to love was Yogi. He was like an adult child and I loved it. He was a well-designed, well thought out comic relief that really relieved stress off of the constant depression that hitting me, wave after wave, in this anime. Those three characters were designed in genius. The one thing I didn\u2019t like is that there were WAY TOO MANY CHARACTERS!!! I never learned all of their names. You know that when a watcher can\u2019t learn all of the names, you added too many characters to count. Many of them added absolutely nothing to the anime. No comic relief, no added action, some of them sucked at fighting, it was ridiculous. There was very little character development in some serious protagonists, and even the antagonists had fuck all development. I never learned what happened to them! I never learned their secrets or their true intentions! That\u2019s not good.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\\n\r\nOkay, I\u2019m not lying when I say I like this anime. Sure, it was cute and fun to watch. I liked the episodes that didn\u2019t take themselves seriously; that was the show\u2019s strong point. The episodes where there was actually supposed to be \u201cplot development\u201d died. Many of them bored me and I longed for more \u201cunseriousness.\u201d I get that they were trying, but their attempts were unsuccessful. The plot was developed horribly, what else can I say? The development of relationships and connections were done really well though and that was what I enjoyed. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n",

            "content": "I was immediately attracted to this anime because of the gorgeous character designs. The intricacy of the details and the unique appearances...so, very confused by the lack of information on the plot, I began Karneval, expecting a lot of beautiful characters and an equally wonderful story. However, I have to say that Karneval is one of those animes that begins with a great premise and then fails to fulfill the expectations that it builds. \r\nStory :: 6\r\nUnfortunately, I was disappointed by the story. It started out interesting, albeit not that unique, and became even more fascinating when Circus showed up on the scene. As themultiple plot lines began to build, I became excited to see a climax, a resolution, how the entire mess would turn out. The problem is, there isn't a resolution. Karneval just keeps getting more and more confusing until there's no possible way out. The last episode served a mediocre ending, and, for me, created even more issues. \\n\\n\r\nArt :: 9\\n\r\nTo reiterate, the artwork is what attracted me to Karneval. I think this anime is one of the best I've seen in terms of artwork. It did get a little too sparkly at times for my taste, but just take a look at it on Google Images, and I'm sure you won't be disappointed. The character designs are incredibly richly detailed and everyone has such a unique design that there's no way that you could get confused between the characters. The animation itself does fall down a few times, but overall I was so entranced by the designs of the characters that animation errors didn't bother me that much. \\n\\n\r\nSound :: 6\\n\r\nOther than the ED, in my opinion, the music doesn't stand out. The OP is very fitting for the series, however. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter :: 7\\n\r\nThe characters each had attractive, individual personalities, but they really needed a lot more development. I feel as though the anime only scratched the surface of their true personalities. A little bit of background on the characters, maybe a few flashbacks, might have been helpful to the plot as well. Some of the characters received such inadequate development that I knew barely anything about them when the series ended, even if they were characters that were central to the plot, such as Karoku and Akari. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment :: 6\\n\r\nLooking back on it now, I think the only thing that kept me attracted to the anime was the artwork [ and the constant desire to listen to the ED song ]. It could have been so much better. A season 2 where the plot is developed would be a great help to this anime, but unfortunately, it doesn't seem as though there's one planned. \\n\\n\r\nOverall :: 6\\n\r\nIt was alright. Karneval doesn't stand out for anything besides the art. I didn't dislike it at any point, but there were a lot of errors and plot holes that could have been ameliorated in some way. I wanted to like this, but I couldn't.",

            "content": "9.7/10\r\nThe story was pretty good, with the two main characters Gareki and Nai getting involved with Circus, as well as the Varuga and Kafka. The pacing was done well, but even though it was only a 13 episode anime, I personally feel that it wrapped up quite nicely. Even though you are still stuck with the question of \"What happened to Uro? What about Palned?\", the future for characters like Gareki are shown, and thus end the anime without too many loose ends. I liked the story line, and the humor they put in every once in a while was enjoyable. The main characters, Nai,Gareki, Yogi, and Tsukumo, spent a lot of time in the hospital, though. But when they go out on a mission, something very entertaining always happens.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was amazing. It was really colorful without being gaudy. The animation was fluid and not bothersome to watch at all. The way the characters were drawn, from the eyes to their outfits was outstanding. Even extra characters, like the nurses and children, were drawn meticulously and looked great. The way the Varuga were drawn was done very well. The fact that they are colored black makes it obvious when someone or something is a Varuga and it is a nice contrast to the constant colors.\\n\\n\r\nThe music and voices in this anime are on-point. The opening is Henai no Rondo by GRANRODEO, who also sang many openings for Kuroko's Basketball. The graphics are great in the opening. They immediately show all the characters, and show the relationship between Gareki and Nai. It was timed well and after they show the characters, they all get 2-4 seconds to show their abilities. The ending was nice, because it was a little Niji (you'll learn about them in the anime) running up as all the characters that showed up, even in only 2 episodes, are slowly scrolled down. It is a very pleasant song called Reason by KAmiYU. The soundtrack was great. I liked listening to it and some of the songs consisted of a piano or some string instruments. It did a good job of setting the mood and it was enjoyable to listen to it. The voices were on point. Gareki, being the cold person he was, was played by Hiroshi Kamiya (Noragami: Yato, Durarara: Izaya Orihara). Nai was played by Hiro Shimono (Kami nomi zo Shiru Sekai: Katsuragi Keima) and had an innocent tone to his voice. Yogi was played by Mamoru Miyano (Death Note: Yagami Light) and he brought Yogi's character to life. Tsukumo was played by Aya Endou (Lucky Star: Miyuki Takara) and portrayed Tsukumo's character as a Kuudere very well.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were very interesting. The design for each of them was unique and different. However, with so many characters, some of them were not developed as much as one may like. The character development for Gareki was done well as Gareki went from a cold person who thought of people as enemy, prey, or nothing, to someone who cared about his friends in Circus. Nai's soul became stronger while he was still kind to people around him, easily considering one he just met a friend. Yogi went through a sudden transformation in one of the episodes, resulting in a deeper character than one may think. Tsukumo became more social and more friendly towards people on the Second Ship. \\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime. It is one of my favourites. I was first attracted to it by its art style, and I really enjoyed watching the characters go through many ordeals with the Varuga. I don't have a favourite character (because I love so many of them) but I do have a least favourite. The action scenes were well paced, and the animation was top notch. The story was interesting and had a small but shocking plot twist at the end, and the soundtrack was one of the nicest one person can hear, in my opinion.",

            "content": "Karneval is an anime that has beautiful art, great music, intriguing characters,  talented seiyuus, and... a bunch of bad ratings. So what went wrong? \r\nFrom the beginning, it became apparent that this show's most appealing and irresistible factor was the eye candy, but it seemed like there could be something more. The first two episodes were promising and seemed to set up the right amount of quirky mysteries to make this anime intriguing and addicting. The problem, however, was that instead of slowly resolving these so-called mysteries, the writers just kept adding in more and more with every episode. As a result, way toomany questions were being asked and, sadly, no one bothered to answer them. As in, ever. Not even in the last episode. Or in another season. Just, no. \\n\\n\r\nAnd that's what made this show so utterly disappointing. The fact that it had pretty much everything, and, in the end, it had nothing. Since not even the slightest of attempts was made to resolve a single one of the mysteries or answer a single one of the questions being asked even at the end of this show (I mean, the bad guys literally just run away without saying anything), it made everything else that happened up to that point feel empty, pointless, and a complete waste of potential (and huge one, at that).\\n\\n\r\nConsequently, I was left guessing not only as to what happened with Nai and all the other characters before and after this show, but even as to why this show was made in the first place. I mean, why bother with pretty art and animation and fantastic voice acting and music (as well as a setup for an interesting plot), if you're not going to take it anywhere and just let everything and everyone fall flat on their faces? \\n\\n\r\nThese are the questions I still ask myself to this day. By leaving such a bitter taste in my mouth, Karneval made me feel... well, hardly anything. It wasn't terrible enough for me to hate it and it wasn't great enough for me to love it either. In a nutshell, it was just another anime that was all dressed up with nowhere to go. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough I wouldn't say I absolutely didn't enjoy watching this series, I also wouldn't really call it \"enjoyable\". If you love watching eye candy (even if you can't really taste it or feel it) and are willing to sit through a plot-hole-ridden, unresolved, magical adventure just for the sake of watching pretty characters wear pretty clothes and put on pretty circus shows, then this is the anime for you. If you're looking for a more rewarding, fulfilling experience, then definitely skip it and save yourself the disappointment.",

            "content": "*major-spoiler-free!*\r\nKarneval. I saw one of the characters in a video last year and a couple of days ago i decided to watch it. It was amazing. I loved every minute of watching it. This show somewhat reminds me of Black Butler, and I love Black Butler so.. it was great.\r\nSTORY\r\nSo basically, there is a guy by the name of Gareki, who is a thief. He only targets rich people's homes. One day, he rescues a boy who was held captive in one of these houses. They travel together until they get chased by people who threaten to kill them, but luckily they are saved byCircus, an organization that fights evil in order to protect the world.\\n\\n\r\nI like the concept of the show, BUT for me there were a lot of plot holes or things I felt were not explained properly in the show. (I know everything is explained in the manga.. but I am reviewing this and not the manga so....) For example: who exactly is Karoku to Nai? What happened to Karoku? and more things that are spoilers so I'm not gonna tell you about them.. \\n\\n\r\nART\\n\r\nThis art style is less for me... but the animation is practically flawless. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\r\nI LOVE the songs and music that was used in the show. It fits the atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\r\nThis is the first time I can say it: I love all the characters (but 3) they are amazing and funny, though they can be emotional. You can really feel Gareki grow emotionally and change for the better.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this show. Though I give it an 8 because of the plot holes and my least favorite moments.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend you to watch this show. It is great and tells an amazing story in 13 episodes.",

            "content": "If you like interesting and creative fantasy worlds with handsome boys and some nice battles, welcome on board! You will sure have fun!\r\nStory\r\nWhat I liked the most about the story are the infinity possibilities the plot allows. It begins with Nai meeting Gareki and both of them getting involved with the Varuga and the organization which fights them -- the Circus --, and anything can happen from this moment on. The plot has a nice structure, with two main objectives presented in the beginning -- Nai wants to find Karoku; the Circus investigates the Varuga and think Nai can be useful for them --, amiddle in which everyone tries to reach their objectives, and a conclusion at the end. As the manga isn't finished, there are still some threads dangling at the end, but they managed to show us a conclusion for the main objectives, even if partially and with new questions coming from that. It is an \"open end\" which calls for a continuation, but still feels like it had an end. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nI must say I hate yaoi and Nai's uke appearance annoyed me at the beginning. But when I started thinking of him as a cute fantasy creature, I ended up laughing at some scenes that became cute (yes, just like Gareki did!). Now I actually like him a lot. He is a pure-hearted boy searching for Karoku, a misterious guy who is important to him.\\n\r\nGareki, on the other hand, is a smart guy and a skilled shooter who distrusts people, but can actually be very gentle. It is easy to love his personality.\\n\r\nThere is also Yogi, with a childish personality which provides lots of funny scenes with the serious Gareki, and there is Tsukumo, the only girl in the main cast, who is very quiet.\\n\r\nI wouldn't say they own very original personalities, but their past and the mystery behind them make them unique and interesting.\\n\\n\r\nVoices\\n\r\nA strong point of this anime. At first, I wasn't sure about Kamiya Hiroshi doing Gareki's role, but no one should ever doubt HiroC. He is a pro. He made an amazing job, and his voice fits Gareki perfectly!\\n\r\nAt the first episodes, I could feel Shimono Hiro was forcing his voice to sound younger than his usual characters, but he probably got used to it, so Nai's voice sounded much more natural in the second half of the anime. I feel glad it was Shimono-san, and not a girl doing Nai's voice.\\n\r\nMiyano Mamoru got Yogi's role. Do I need to say more? It was not a surprise after all, as Mamo-chan is one of the best at voicing this kind of character. I can imagine him having a lot of fun during the recording. \\n\r\nEndou Aya did a good job with Tsukumo's (few) lines. Also, Ono Daisuke was a nice choice for Hirato's role.\\n\\n\r\nMusic\\n\r\nOpening theme by GRANRODEO. Personally, I think this band fits shounen anime better, but I'm not complaining, because they are great and so is the song.\\n\r\nEnding theme by KAmiYU. Just perfect. It has a happy and colorful melody which fits the anime. But do you know it is Gareki (HiroC) who sings that? It's funny if you see things this way.\\n\r\nI will be honest and say I didn't pay much attention to the soundtrack, and it's not a bad thing. The soundtrack helped building the mood of each scene naturally, never deviating my attention or forcing feelings into me -- the sad scenes were actually sad and didn't need a sad music coming from nowhere to tell me how should I feel.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nVery beautiful, with a nice character design and vivid colors.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nWhat I liked the most about this anime is that it's mostly for girls, but has nice battles and is settled in a very interesting fantasy world. The characters and the story captivated me, and I had a lot of fun!\\n",

            "content": "Karneval is a shojou anime, boarding on shonen-ai. It follows the adventures of Nai and Garaki and how they got involved with Circus, a secret organization which protects Japan from monsters.\r\nThe story is kind of loose. It's mainly about Nai and how he is looking for Karoku, but also about Gareki and how he tries to make himself useful to everyone around him in circus. I say loose because they are not really actively searching for Karoku and a lot of the time they just seem to be roaming around without any real direction of what they are doing. For being an organization that issupposed to take out monsters they don't really seem to care that much about doing their jobs.\\n\\n\r\nKarneval has two true main characters, Nai and Gareki. They are also really the only two characters that get any form of development. Nai is an young innocent boy who has super sensitive hearing (which is not really utilized) who is looking for his friend, Karoku. He runs into Gareki, a cold loner who just seems to be along for the ride (but the reasons why he stays is explained later). He is really the only good character in the show and it would have been a lot more enjoyable if more characters had such development. Nai himself is just annoying, yes, his personality fits his background and character twist (which is IMO incredibly dumb and you'll know why once you get to it), but I'd rather have him be more engaging than more or less fit perfectly into his backstory.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters are mildly entertaining, but don't really get a lot of development. Yogi is probably the most \"main\" of the side characters, but is really just there for some comic relief. Tsukumo is really there for being the only female in the entire show.\\n\\n\r\nBy far the worst thing in the entire show is the dialogue. Now, I watch this subbed like I'm sure most of you do so maybe it's not really that bad, but I am surprised when a character makes a full sentence. Actually, I was not sure if Nai was even able to say more than Karoku and Gareki for a while. Also, Yogi seems to cry through half of his lines, which is not really dialogue, but his voice acting is bad even compared to the rest of this cast which I would say did not do a great job presenting their characters.\\n\\n\r\nIf you really like looking at girly boys, that are not traps, then this is a show for you. The art is pretty good too, at least it has a pleasant style that seems to fit the show. However, if you want anything else, even some sort of romance then you are sorely out of luck.",

            "content": "The task or purpose of a circus is to keep the audience entertained throughout the show they deliver; sparkling lights, well costumed actors and cute, yet dangerous animals are either helpful and seek your attention. None would dare to blink more than absolutely necessary. Once you leave, it is the greatest reward for a circus if you would not forget what you just have experienced. A reward which Karneval struggles to achieve. \r\nThe anime opens with two of the main character, Nai and Gareki. Nai - a simple minded boy who clearly cannot survive in such a harsh world \u2013 is looking for a guynamed Karoku. His search brings him in contact with Gareki, a young pickpocket guy who has nowhere to go. After seeing Nais priceless bracelet that would bring Gareki certainly the so much needed money, they end up on the run and encounter a battle between the supernatural Government defense force known as Circus and a evil supernatural organization named Kafka that develops these demonic creatures called Varugas. Both, Gareki and Nai would soon be caught in the hunt as the mysterious organizations seems to have a deep interest in each of them \u2013 and especially since Nai is not as human as he appears.\\n\\n\r\nKarneval has rather modest ambitions, and accordingly, it packs only a modest emotional punch in terms of story and character development; it is mainly about pretty guys \u2013 in roles big and small - in pretty, yet fancy outfits and the characters leave a lot to be desired. \\n\\n\r\nTalking of which, this leads us the first issue: the characters. The main characters (Garki, Nai, Yogi and Tsukumo) are attractive and each of them is individual; however, there is still room for development. Gareki is a guy who does not like getting close to people but actually cares for them deeply whereas Yogi is a rather childish guy who wants to get along well with everyone. Nai is the innocent and cute guy, but as the story progresses \u2013 which it hardly does - he becomes more and more a background character. And last but not least, there is Tsukumo, a fighting, yet calm girl who \u2013 after the anime introduces her \u2013 is not as interesting as we might have expected her to be. In conclusion: out of the main cast, Gareki is the only one who receives a proper background which is why he seems to be the most interesting of the cast.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some other pretty faces stumbling through this show but due to the lack of depth and further explanations, we cannot help but to realize that we do not care for the characters at all; yet, they serve the anime as the ordinary, stereotypical supporting characters. \\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are several issues with the story. The anime has two plot points: one is about the rather lukewarm relationship of Gareki and Nai whereas the other is all about the mysterious organization called Circus. \\n\\n\r\nThe story of Gareki and Nai is more a personal journey; Nai seems to love Karoku -. a mysterious young man who does have screen appearances but the viewer has little to no clue to his true origin or identity; which is why Nais own identity is mostly unclear throughout the series - but apparently grows very fond of Gareki as well. And Gareki slowly changes whenever he hangs out with Nai. And even though this plot takes up a lot of the series running time, there can barely be seen any progression at the end of the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe second plot about Circus is mostly a puzzle throughout the series; at first glance, this plot appears to be generally just about certain missions the members of Circus tackle that Nai and Garkei tags along to. In fact, however, it is about their pursuit of the organization called Kafka. Circus is actually trying to find suitable evidence of crime since Kafka is responsible for creating monsters called Varuga. These monsters were once humans that got their cells altered. As a result, they became rather deformed super humans that hurt innocent people. The issue in this plot is the lack of explanations. They are an organization - involving some pretty faces - and that is nearly it. Therefore, the manga gives you unquestionably better explanations. \\n\\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, it is saddening to see that the anime lets you down even though it has such a stunning animation. The character designs are all gloriously done; the world looks as if it wants to be explored and the studio added so many little, yet seemingly unimportant background details which really highlights the series strength.\\n\r\nAdditionally, editing and cutting are well-directed too which is sort of the pounding heart of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening song is definitely a good start into the show, whereas the rest of the soundtrack appears rather decent: in other words, it is only noticeable during tense moments. It has its moments when it shines out brighter than expected but all in all there are numerous of far better soundtracks out there. \\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned in the opening, the series struggles to achieve any notable reward. The concept might have been promising but failed to keep you breathless in the seat - while the show is running - until the curtain falls for the last time. And after it fell it was and is clear: most would leave the show without having a look back. \\n",

            "content": "(This is one of my first reviews so bear with me please)\r\nSo Karneval is mystery anime, with some tints of action and some shoujo for the fangirls. We meet the main character, \"Nai\", who by first glance isn't nothing special. His name literally means, 'Nothing'. By chance he meets Gareki, your typical 'bad-boy I don't need anyone' type of character. Those are our main characters we will be following throughout the series. \r\nStory: 8/10\r\nNai is looking for someone special to him, Karoku, with only a bracelet as a clue. At the beginning of the first episode we find him in a difficult predicament, in whichhe meets Gareki. How did he get there? We will never know, and it will never be explained. Being of the mystery genre, there are some things that will obviously leave you clueless but there are some things that this anime can leave in blank. They meet the secret (yet flashy) organization \"Circus\", who fight against the organization \"Kafka\" and the monsters called \"Varuga\". These monsters are often mentioned in the series but we never go in depth with them. \\n\\n\r\nSo overall the plot is very interesting and enticing, but the anime left more than a few things to be asked for.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThe animation for this series was very beautiful and well made. The colors they used were very soft, and for the most mysterious character they weren't so solemn or anyting of the sort. The animation was very smooth, taking well the flips, the turns, the explosions and the other movements. The drawing was very 'cute', what with Nai being your typical big eyed feminine meek character and Tsukumo your beautiful limber acrobat. The characters were distinguishable and I had no hard time in differentiating them. The only downside were some animation mistakes but those can be looked upon on and are hardly noticable.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe opening was rock, with some 'carneval' touches. As a fan of GRANRODEO, it was good but not their best. But it was appropriate for the anime. The ending was a pop/catchy tune, and it caught me singing it every time I heard it. The soundtracks stuck to the moment, with the fighting scenes and the sad parts, but they weren't very noticable. The voice acting was fine, the seiyuus stuck to the character's personality and I had no problems with this.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/9\\n\r\nThere many characters in Karneval, all with a beautiful character design and their own personality. The main character Nai is extremely innocent and pure, knowing nothing from the real world, as he couldn't even distinguish blood. But once you find out what he really is, it's quite understandable. Gareki was probably one of the only characters we got a somewhat full backstory, explaining his attitude and why he does what he does. The supporting characters, the members of Circus, look like some of the most interesting but with no development at all. We get subtle hints of Yogi and Tsukumo, but nothing on their backstory. Including with Captain Hirato and the other members of Circus. There are also some members of Kafka mentioned in the series, but nothing explained on them whatsoever, and you will be scratching your head at the end with Karoku. But once again, it is understandable since you can only pack so much in 13 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nEven if there were somethings that left me wondering with this anime, I enjoyed it. The character interaction was enjoyable and it reached it's cuteness factor and some humor. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nIt was a nice anime, overall. It's great if you want to look at something cute and pretty while having some mystery and action at the same time. With so much left to ask for, it makes you want to search for more but there's the manga for that. It's an anime that needs focus and dedication, but if you can do that then I can assure you can enjoy its moments.",

The art is very nicely a done matches the tone of the show perfectly.The music of the show is also great to the point where i listen to its opening by itself. The voice acting is done flawlessly as the voices portray the characters well in thesense they both suit them and convey emotion well.

            "content": "So the all-star cast and the nice art drew me in. \r\nI was not impressed.\r\nA small heads-up: I've only watched 5 eps of this show. If what I say below doesn't hold true for those who have watched the entire show, my apologies.\r\nThe first episode seemed like the overture for a HUGE plot and some serious worldbuilding. However it soon became clear that the show had no intention of tying up its knots. Some things were just left hanging, and I got more and more confused. As I moved on to the later episodes, it was clear that the scope of the world had narrowed,nullifying all of its \"foreshadowing\" in the pilot episode. \\n\\n\r\nFor example, in the very start, a woman was holding Nai (main character) captive, but the show never explains why. When an intruder comes into the room where Nai was, the woman just... walks off and disappears for a while. Just...why? A lot of things in the show don't make much sense. \\n\\n\r\nWhich leads us to my biggest problem with show: the special abilities. The special abilities of different characters  were not elaborated upon (at least till ep5), and that could have been alright if those abilities hadn't been so damn inconsistent. It's not an exaggeration when I say that this show has one of the least comprehensive magical systems I have ever seen. The characters' abilities seemed to fluctuate purely for the plot.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, they were FINE, but they were just fine. The main protagonist (Nai) is kind of atypical in that he is a completely useless mascot-ish main character, which is not really a virtue when you think about it. Gareki on the other hand is quite run-of-the-mill, the tsundere guy with a \"bad boy front\" but a good heart. However, his design is pretty nice, although there is nothing particularly outstanding about it. Unfortunately for this show, Gareki and Nai are the most prominent characters, yet neither of them do much, mostly relying on others to clean up their mess. None of the other supporting characters piqued my interest, so not much more to say here.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I feel like the whole world here caters to Gareki and Nai, making their decisions easy for them and effectively allowing them to do whatever they want, since some deus ex machina will appear in time to save them from whatever danger they're in. That's the halo of protagonists maxed out for all you viewers.\\n\\n\r\nThe best thing about this anime is just the art. However, that's not surprising considering its source material: look the manga up. The mangaka sure knows her (his?) stuff. Her art is STUNNING. \\n\\n\r\nAnd after reading the first chapter of Karneval's manga, the verdict is in: the manga is better than the anime. The manga addresses nearly all of the problems that I had with the first ep. Which begs the question: why the pointless changes?? To fill up the time??\\n\\n\r\n5 for this mediocre anime!",

The anime really left on a cliffhanger and I would highly recommend reading on from where the anime left off in the manga. \r\nThe show is unlike any style I've seen before and it's communicated very well. The colours are sparkly and vibrant and very pleasing to look at. The english dub isn't hard to sit through at all, in fact it's one of thebetter dubs in anime history.",

            "content": "Do you happen to be female? Yes? Do you like watching tons of bishies fight yet also have enough fluff moments to satisfy your inner fangirl? Really?\r\nThen \"Karneval\" might be an anime for you. \r\nLet me say that Karneval is not a masterpiece, it's not something that changes your view of life. Still, it's a rather nice series to watch on a boring afternoon. Maybe you've watched animes like \"K\" or \"07-Ghost\", they both deliver an equal amount of fighting and fanservice. \r\nIf you liked either of them, you'll probably like this one. \r\nBut let's get to a more detailed description: \r\nStory 7/10\r\nWhile there isa decent plot, you sometimes get the feeling that it's just too much at once. Karneval desperately tries to make its supernatural aspects seem logical, yet it kind of fails at that. The viewer is overwhelmed by the amount of information and confusing plot twists that simply shouldn't be put in a 13-episode-anime. \\n\r\nNevertheless, the story is original and the circus-theme is something you don't encounter that often. \\n\r\nIt's obvious that the author spent lots of time creating a smart plot and even though that wasn't a complete success, it's alright. \\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10 \\n\\n\r\nAs for the art, I personally think it was the best aspect of the show. The characters look very nice and detailed (everyone has his/her own hairstyle, eye shape, clothing style etc.), the surroundings are okay. What stands out are the well animated fighting scenes, the bright, happy atmosphere is able to turn into a dark battlefield with monsters and bloodshed - and it works out.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI really like the OP as it suits the show. Perfectly fitting seiyuus (especially for the main characters ) that did a great job are nothing to complain about, either. So why \"only\" 7 points? Well, there's just honestly not much else to praise when it comes to the sound. Nothing outstanding. But let's be honest, there are few animes with a truly great soundtrack, so this is forgivable. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters. Duh. Wouldn't even be half as bad, yet, there are just so freaking /many/ of them. It feels like they randomly introduced tons of new characters in every single episode just because the author felt like including every single kind of bishie she could think of. This makes Karneval unnecessarily confusing - who likes/hates who? Wait, who the hell is this guy? Why would he --\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the protagonists, they are quite likeable and even show kind of a character development throughout the show. We even get to know parts of their backstories. Unfortunately they don't get the amount of attention they deserve because Karneval is busier introducing new ones. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10\\n\\n\r\nWhen I watch airing animes, some make me eagerly wait for the next episode the second I finish watching the last one, watching them within an hour after their release and desperately updating the stream site. \\n\r\nKarneval wasn't one of them. It's something I watched when there wasn't anything else to do. \\n\r\nDespite its flaws, though, Karneval is a fairly enjoyable show. Nothing amazing, but an okay plot and attractive males make it an appealing watch for the female masses. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10\\n\\n\r\nYeah, Karneval gets a 7/10 from me. I completely understand when people rate it lower than this, though. Watching an anime and not being the target audience sucks, and makes the anime seem dull. With animes like \"Karneval\" it just isn't clear that the audience consists of young females with a liking for very mild shounen-ai. Have one of those girls watch a high-rated ecchi... and she won't like it either. \\n\\n\r\nAnyway, I hope you found my review to be helpful and I would love to know whether you agree or disagree with me!\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I just finished watching Karneval and I must say, I didn't expect I would enjoy the show this much. I've read reviews about it and most of it said it would just be a typical anime show with a boy who is a bit weak to stand on his own eventually meets a guy who's stronger and they become friends and all. THAT! Would be a Yes at first.\r\nI gave it a 10 because it didn't turn out to be the TYPICAL anime show I was expecting it to be. It started with Nai, a helpless and innocent  boy looking for someone, who accidentallymeets  Gareki, a mysterious wandering guy with a gun who wants nothing but money. Not so long after, they bumped into Circus, a Defense organization that works for the government, definitely NOT your typical Security force. I don't want to spoil anything so let's stop there :D I would say the beginning of the story is your usual type of story but after that, it's all bizarre. Turns out, Karneval is full of mysteries, and the mysteries don't get revealed overnight. This ain't a detective story or what, it's all about Nai, which makes Nai and his identity, a mystery as well. As the show goes on, you'll be discovering certain connections between the characters and it will all make sense. But, in the end, you'll still want more from this show. \\n\\n\r\nI love the characters! My personal favorites, Gareki and Nai (love them). I think they all served their purpose. Nobody's annoying or unreasonable. Some are left mysterious which makes me want a Season 2. Kudos to the voice actors, once again, a job well done.\\n\\n\r\nAside from mystery, another thing you'll get attracted to this show is its cuteness. I so love the animals :D Watch it and you'll get why",

The anime itself looks really good, its animated very well and the characters are also very well chosen out. \r\nI did enjoy this anime to some extent, however, there were a couple of times where... I wouldn't say I felt dethatched but just some of the things that went on weren't exactly gripping.\r\nSome of the characters in the anime got on my nerves more than once, and mostly, that came down topersonality of that character, but more than once I found myself annoyed with some of them. \\n\r\nBut more than once I found some of the characters absolutely adorable or funny.\\n\r\nBut overall, I did like this anime. It looked good, the story/plot was an interesting difference to a couple other anime out there. Other than certain quirks of the characters which may get on some people's nerves, this anime is something worth a watch, there were times where I got frustrated, sure, but there were also times where I did enjoy myself and care about what was going on. \\n\\n\r\n7/10 overall, nice anime Karneval \\n",

In truth I might just be being a bit generous due to the simple fact that some of the voices in it happen to be some of my favorite voice actors. I really want to see this series reach its full potential, however, I fear thatwill not happen if they leave it as is. If you are looking for a series to just peak an interest this one is for you.",

            "content": "Ok, so this is my first review so chances are that this will be less than perfect.\r\nHere we go....\r\nKarneval is a nice (although short) series brought to use by Manglobe, who we can also thank for other very well known works such as Samurai Champloo and Ergo Proxy.\r\nThe story starts as such:\r\nA boy, later learned to be named Nai, is being held for some unknown reason by a woman. Within the first few minutes our other main character, Gareki, crashes through by seemingly complete coincidence to steal any valuables in the house. Gareki agrees to help Nai escape and find a man named Karoku, inexchange for his strange and mysterious bracelet.\\n\\n\r\nFrom here the characters are somehow let to Circus, a government run organization in charge of controlling crime. Here we are introduced to many interesting characters.\\n\\n\r\nAnd here is where the series shines the most: the personalities of each character. Because there are so many characters, I will just focus on the 5 key characters.\\n\\n\r\nNai is an adorable, childlike young boy. Although despite his innocence, he has an air of mystery about his existence and has some pretty key senses for not only hearing, but can easily tell the emotions of the people he is closest to. Although he may not always fully understand what is going on, he will jump at the chance to defend those he loves even though he probably knows that he would most likely lose in a fight.\\n\\n\r\nGareki is our sort of \"tsundere\" character for the series, although in this case that really isn't a bad thing. In the first episode he is introduced an undisputed shoot now ask questions later badass. However, as the series progresses we begin to realize that this appearance is a facade. Most notably, he gets easily threatened by things that make him feel any emotions that may seen \"unmasculine\". This can lead to some interesting moments where he gets mad at Nai or Yogi, who can make him feel uncomfortable due to how open they often are with their feeling and actions. ALthough I do find the \"tsundere\" character to be way overused in this kind of anime, this actually works well in the show's favor. Gareki isn't just an emotionless jerk for the sake of being a jerk. There is a genuine reason why he fears allowing himself to show emotions and get attached to people. By the end of the series Gareki seems to be well on his way to letting go of his past and accepting his feelings towards his newfound family. However, this is where the series falters slightly. At only 12 episodes, Gareki's development feels a bit rushed in the last few episodes. It seems like there is just a sudden change from being completely inaccessible to softening up, with no real major moment that should have triggered this change. I've never read the manga, so I'm not sure if this is unique to the show or if it was a problem with the source material.\\n\\n\r\nAnd next we have Yogi. Yogi is the one who first brings Gareki and Nai to Circus. At first he may seem a little annoying, but as the series goes on he just might become your favorite character. Yogi is fun, energetic, and loves being around others. Basically, he is the polar opposite of Gareki which makes for some very entertaining interactions between the two. Although at first he seems whiny and clingy, you quickly learn that this is simply because the members of Circus are all he has, and as a result he fears losing them or not being liked by them. Together, the members of Airship Two form a sort of family. Yogi, in some ways, seems to be the center of this.\\n\\n\r\n(edit this later its late lol)",

            "content": "I haven't been to a Carnival since quite the time now, and was delighted to come across this anime which finally had that unique atmosphere.I had quite a struggle to whether or not to give this anime an 8, but in the end the anime itself proved it's accomplishment in getting the score. \r\nIt's about a helpless boy named Nai (who has weird ears) who is trying to find a person named Karoku, he himself get kidnapped by beings called \"Varuga\" and gets saved by Gareki (a thief) Thus we follow the continuing story of Nai and Gareki's adventures with an anti-criminal organization called \"Circus\"\r\nStory:Friendships are the biggest highlight in this story, i guess many can call this Yaoi, but whatever it is it urges the audience to keep watching. I believe that the whole story was based in an interesting metaphor the metaphor being the \"Circus\" As it can be compared that the Varga are the animals that are needed to be tamed by the \"Circus\" and \"Kafhka\" This story has a good ending, and many plot twists unlike most anime this one answer the question \"HOW\" and \"WHY\"\\n\\n\r\n1/How do they have super powers?\\n\r\n2/Why are they like that?\\n\\n\r\nWere some of the questions that were answered absolutely clearly in this anime. There weren't any complicated mechanisms, even if they were complicated i have no doubt the anime explained it to us effectively.\\n\\n\r\nArt: It was because of the cover that I had the urge to watch the anime in the first place, thus the art was very admirable.The openings and endings were done creatively, everything was based on the \"Carnival\" atmosphere.I also appreciated that the Character clothing was changed respectively from time to time(which most anime does not do)\\n\\n\r\nSound: The characters were voiced by the right Voice-actors, they did it superbly.The Soundtracks were good. There were some interesting pieces which played whenever Karoku was mentioned and another which had Slow Piano piece. The Openings and Endings were okay. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Since this is the circus people,they do get to do performances and their roles in the performances suits their personalities. Like Clown being Yogi and Hirato being the magician. Gareki himself is a different type of a Tsundere character, which i wanted to see in many anime but haven't seen except in this one. The girls are not weak, all of them can fight and i thought that was pretty cool. Usually the character emotions are displayed indirectly to the audience and there were some unexpected character outbursts. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I enjoyed this one, wanted more episodes. But just so you know, there aren't any news of a second season. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: I expected more from this, but i believe that if this anime had about 50 episodes max and a min of 24. it would have earned a lot from me. Also this one was creative and id worth watching.\\n\\n",

Regardless, it was a very enjoyable and interesting show.\r\nThe story was very interesting, and more parts of the plot would be revealed as the show went on, I don't want to spoil too much. The problem is that Karneval is short, only 13 episodes and the last episode doesn't tie the story together, instead only furthers causes viewers to ask more questions. Because of this, its difficult to comprehend what is going on, or the significance of a character. This really disappointed me and brought the show down, because moreof the show is much needed! Despite this, the show somehow managed to fit so many different events in and was very fun to watch.\\n\r\nOf course, the art in the show was so beautiful and attractive. There are even colourful details in the character's eyes. The settings looked really great too. When the characters use magic, I'm stunned looking at it. The soundtrack sounds amazing and the opening is very bright. Paired with the great art style, the action scenes are very enjoyable.\\n\r\nI really loved the characters of the show. Their unique designs made them easy to remember and fit their personalities well. The two main characters are opposite in both personality and looks, yet they're still so closely bonded. The other characters are also so interesting, however the show is so short you don't get to see much of them. Nai and Gareki developed nicely by the end of the show, yet maintained their character integrity. Nai is very weak, but he is a useful asset to Circus and his friendly and kind hearted personality helps the people around him. Gareki however seems to not be nice or friendly, but as the show goes on, his kind actions are revealed. Overall, very enjoyable to watch, however extremely unfinished and unsatisfying ending.",

            "content": "I don't usually write reviews, but at this one I feel like I have to share my opinion with you. Especially with people who expect an exciting and interesting action anime. Because that's NOT what you get from this one.\r\nFirst of all, I really wanted to like this anime. I haven't read the manga yet, so i can't say anything about that. But after watching the trailer of the anime, i was sure that no doubt, this is going to be an amazing action fantasy anime, with horror elements. But they basically cut all of the badass looking scenes in the anime, and titled itas trailer, making it look like, what I expected it to be: twisted, sick, with horroristic enemies and nerve wracking fights.\\n\\n\r\nLet me start by saying, how many chances they missed, when it comes to characters. In the beginning we met Gareki and Nai. It could have been interesting if the anime just followed their journey, but no. As soon as they met the organisation called Circus, they blended into the crew of the ship, and became uninteresting sidecharacters. So I was basically left with 2 interesting episodes in the beginning. After that I couldn't even tell anymore, who was supposed to be the main character, because, non of them got enough time on screen to be somewhat loveable, or to make the audience get attached to them. \\n\r\nBut let me explain one by one:\\n\\n\r\nNai: They could have done so much with him, but instead, his character showed absolute no development. Expect his ability to hear noises, the others can't, he didn't do anything. He wasn't mysterious, nor interesting. And I get it, what they were trying the do. But it didn't work. Nai was supposed to be the typical naiv and innocent boy, who only sees the good in the world, but it just became forced after a while, and he didn't get depth to him, and because of that we couldn't actually understand or like him.\\n\\n\r\nGareki: He is the \"badass\" guy in this anime. Even tho he basically doesn't do anything, only in the first and in the last episode. But other than that, all he does, is staring at the events, that are happening around him, and getting kidnapped everytime He doesn't fight, barely talks, or shows any development. I was pretty surprised at some parts. For example, when they were sent to the ship, he wanted to go back into the town. You would think, oh sure because he wanted to go on his own way. But no. He wanted to go, to buy clothes?! I have never seen any \"badass\" characters like this. Just as i said at Nai, the character doesn't work, as they wanted it to. \\n\\n\r\nYogi: The character, you could barely ever take seriously. He was supposed to be the funny guy, but yet again: it didn't work. He was quiet annoying at times, just as Nai. There wasn't any depth to him, and his personality was too similar to Nai's.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the anime, I could see how hard they tried to give us some fanservice by giving us \"cute\" guys and scenes, but it failed. Even the relationships between them turned out to be boring, and we didn't see them interacting to each other in private, so there was no sign of the relationships developing to a deeper level, where the characters could have gotten attached to each other.\\n\\n\r\nBut there was an other thing about the characters that bothered me. The looks. I don't really want to write a lot about this, but I feel like i have to mention it. In the beginning everything fine, but after that, they gave the characters pink and girly outfits, which didn't really fit them. Especially at Gareki. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot could have been better, if they explained some things. But no, we were left with many questions, a lot of plot holes, and with scenes or claimes that didn't make much sense.\\n\r\nThis anime was full of awkward and boring situations/scenes. And they characters we met but only for a few episodes were forgottable, and they had no power to share us some emotions.\\n\r\nThe fights. Theye were the worst. I can forgive the not much developed or weird looking characters, but not the fights. Especially because there was BARELY ANY. We got a few ones, but these \"fights\" were the worsts i have ever seen in any anime. They were  finished in few seconds, and most of the time, with a sidecharacter, who showed up from nothing, just in the final moment. Noone else did anything, and most of the time, expect Yogi none of the main characters even attempted to fight. Why?!  \\n\r\nAnd they didn't even show the end of the fights in the final episodes!\\n\\n\r\nNow you may ask 'But if there was barely any \"fighting\" in the anime, then what was?'- Mostly boring and uninteresting scenes. Pointless situations and forgottable moments, and characters, and basically no or just a few seconds lasting fights. In the trailer were the only cool parts, and we could have gotten much more out of it.\\n\\n\r\nWe didn't even get a boss fight or a big explaination for everything in the final episode. \\n\\n\r\nBut the the visuals and the sound were outstanding. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I am very disappointed, what this anime turned out to be. I'm not judging if anyone likes it, even tho i can't understand why. All I'm saying is, that this is just my opinion, no hate towards the fans. But I just think it's so sad, how they had so much to work with and they missed it all. It started out soo good, but ended as a boring and unenjoyable anime. And I can't give a higher score for like 2 fine episodes in the whole anime.",

It's like they decided to just drop the series, or ran out of funding/inspiration to write and just let it all die a  slow and painful death.

So this won't be very long. \r\nMany of the biggest complaints about the series seems to be caused by the fact it follows the manga with little changes then cuts off where the first arc ended naturally. In other words, the ending is exactly what happened in the manga so they can pick up where they left off if they ever want tocontinue with another season by just continuing to follow the manga (unlike another anime adaptation I know *cough* Pandora Hearts). Since it keeps the pacing of the manga, it is by no means a complete story. We're given bits and pieces of story and information about the world and characters but the anime ends before that information starts coming together in the manga.\\n\\n",

The character development and the relationships between all of them is splendid. I absolutely love Yogi, along with Gareki and Nai. And Tsukumo is cute too, along with the Akari and Hirato.

It became hard for the audience to understand exactly what was happening, and how.\\n\r\nThe borderline shounen ai sometimes was a turn off too.\\n\r\nIn conclusion, it could've been much better.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nI have to say, this is where the story excels. The art is flawless and the battle scenes are outstanding. Even the characters were very good looking and appealing.\\n\r\nIt was perfect. That's all for this section.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nI really did like the OP and ED.\\n\r\nThey worked well together, and fit the anime well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7\\n\r\nOh boy. This is the part in which I have a lot to say. \\n\r\nAlthough the MC was cute, there wasn't really anything more to say about him. I hoped to see him go from kind of useless to a crucial member of the group. \\n\r\nSomething like what happened in Akatsuki no Yona.\\n\r\nBut he remained kind of useless even till the last episode.\\n\r\nThe side characters were very strong and they were enjoyable,in my book at least, but they too had little development throughout the series.\\n\r\nThe one character that particularly stood out to me was Gareki. This guy, he was fantastic.\\n\r\nHe was brave, fearless, and strong throughout the entire show. He was one of the things that made this show from a mess to satisfactory.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nDespite my bashing of this show, I have to say this anime had its moments and elements. It was good to watch just for fun and for passing time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nThis was fine. Not great, not horrible, but just fine , somewhere in the middle.\\n\r\nDo I recommend it?\\n\r\nIf you want an anime with a a great plot that will just suck you in?\\n\r\nThen no.\\n\r\nBut if you want to just let off some stress, with a cute anime that has some comedy and hot guys, then go for it!!\\n",

I'm not a big fan of writing a lot and I prefer to summarize things to a short extent, so bear with me.\r\nPlot - Appalling \r\nKarneval is simply about a boy named Nai who searches for a man named Karuku. He later runs into Gareki, who is a fifeteen year old thief. I'll admit, when I heard about this anime I thought it was going to be centered around a circus and have a whimsical theme to it; however, the entire \"carnival\" thing is portrayed in a different way. \r\nDigging depper intothe plot of Karneval, it is extremely appaling and the pacing is under whelming. Circus is an organization that gathers information about monsters named Varuga; now this is where the anime begins to fall. Karneval explains little to no information about Circus, leaving us with a handful of unanswered questions. They lack information about Circus. On top of that, the plot is extremely disjointed.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - Bad\\n\\n\r\nThis is another point that Karneval fails tremendously in. The characters are one dimensional with little to no depth. There's really no point in going in-depth about the characters because they're horribly written. The side cast is very uninteresting, and they barely get any screentime.\\n\\n\r\nArt - Exquisite \\n\\n\r\nNow this is where Karneval begins to shine. The art of Karneval is absolutely beautiful and exquisite with eyecatching visuals. It's undeniable that the characters are extremely prepossessing and attractive. The bright outfits and great character designs are extremely appealing. This is the area where you'll be appreciating the most from Karneval.\\n\\n\r\nSound - Eargasms \\n\\n\r\nA bit exaggerating, but the sound quality of Karneval is delightful to hear. The only thing I have to mention about the sound area is that the opening is one of my favorites. Simply put - I like the hardcore vibe in it. The ending takes more of a less hardcore approach, but it's still great.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - Decent\\n\\n\r\nKarneval ia definitely not the most enjoyable series you'll ever run into. There are scenes when the anime becomes extremely underwhelming and uninteresting to watch. I'll confess that the visuals are so appealing which is the main reason why I enjoyed this anime somewhat. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion - Forgettable \\n\\n\r\nKarneval has way too much wasted potential. If you're looking for an anime with pleasuring visuals that will give some eyegasms, then you can go ahead and watch Karneval. However, the amazing visuals dosen't change the fact the plot and characters are absolutely dreadful and appalling. Trust me, you're not missing out on anything if you don't watch this. \\n",

            "content": "Karneval is seriously one of the most creative anime that I have ever seen. If you love adventure, action, comedy, magic, and shounen, this is definitely for you!!\r\nStory- The story is very complex, but easy to understand. Everyone has their special stories, and events give many plot twists, so you won't get bored or expect cliche scenes. The story is definitely something creative and never before told. 9/10\r\nArt- The art is just amazing! Everything is especially well drawn, coloured, detailed, and animated. It's completely enthralling. If you are a person who is very critical of good animation and artwork, you will most definitely NOT bedisappointed by Karneval. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound- The voice acting is absolutely amazing and perfectly fits every character! The action sounds are also very realistic and match the scenes. The sound is in very high quality, and you will not be disappointed!\\n\r\nAlso, the OP & ED are known to bring smiles upon everyone's faces, even if something very sad happens in the series. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- The characters are so unique. The main characters include Nai, Gareki, Karoku, Tsukumo, Yogi, and Hirato. They are all wonderfully drawn and depicted very realistically, you will instantly be drawn in by them. The voices match them perfectly, and they are amazingly drawn. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- I, personally, found this to be one of the most enjoyable anime to date. The story just keeps you enticed, and you want to keep continuing the story. -FAIR WARNING!: You will most likely become hooked on this anime, if you have liked what I have told you so far- \\n\r\nThe mystery of the story keeps you wondering, the action/fights keep you on your toes,  and there is plenty of well placed comedic relief. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall- 10/10 As if you couldn't tell already, I absolutely ADORE this anime, it is the one of the most heartwarming, funniest, suspenseful, ADDICTING, stories ever. I promise you, give it a chance and I guarantee that you will enjoy it! If you don't, I will supply you with unlimited Pocky for a whole month ;~;",

He is pretty much an all around useless character that is constantly in a situation and weak and the mystery surrounding him is a bit meh....and the reveal...Well, Garecki's reaction basically mirrored my own.\r\nGarecki is probably my favorite. Your typical bad boy type who rarely smiles and is quick to anger...but he had far more depth to him and I loved his evolution over 13 episodes.\r\nYogi as well as the other Circus members make fantastic secondary characters and theyweren't just there for background...they actually were integral parts even with their own backstories.\\n\\n\r\nThough Jikki is a close second...I just love that twisted like jerk.\\n\\n\r\nThe Good:\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the artwork. Beautiful and well-designed and an absolute pleasure to watch. I can't really criticize the artwork.\\n\\n\r\nTo me there was a subtle/hidden Boy's Love/Shounen-Ai hint. It is never expressed or anything but it was there and I enjoyed that aspect.\\n\\n\r\nThe bad:\\n\\n\r\nThe overall mystery was boring and it felt more like a bunch of stories happening at once and there are some filler episodes(even with only 13 episodes) to the point that by the time we get back to the plot it's like...IDC really.\\n\\n\r\nAnd The Ugly:\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing....It's not a boring anime but it does drag a bit and the ending episodes(episode 12 and 13) are incredibly rushed. \\n\\n\r\nI still have no idea what the hell the overall plot was about and what happened in the end. I was a bit meh about that.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the most annoying thing is probably Nai constantly calling out for his friend or whatever. It got annoying but I am glad that as the anime went on he wasn't doing it every episode like he was early on.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, it was a good anime to watch if you want some decent character development and great artwork and action scenes are decent.\\n\\n\r\nBut don't go into this anime expecting to see some masterpiece or high action or even a cohesive plot....",

            "content": "I finished this anime mainly out of curiosity.\r\nThe art was impressive and caught my attention. And the line-up of the voice actors was also intriguing- a reason on its own to be excited about this anime. But somehow this anime fell short of what could have been one of my favs. \r\nSo, how..? The story has a clear direction and the characters are all strong. There's plenty of action - all the Circus members are agile, and Gareki's skills to create bombs and to use a gun is also believable for an orphan. The art is brilliant - literally, one of the most colorful animeout there, from the costumes to the background. The sound is also excellent - the music enhances each scene, and the voice actors all did a great job (even though I hoped for slightly more from Mamoru Miyano since I admire his work). Normally with all this mentioned, I'd be continuing on raving about this anime at this point. However, the story lacked in depth, and more than anything, the characters lacked development. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is pretty easy to understand; there's the good guys (Circus) and the bad guys (Kafka/Varuga), and then there's Nai who's searching Karoku, with the help of Gareki. The pace of the story bothered me the more I think back, how it kept on jumping from scene to scene, and the focus kept shifting from one character to the next. It also seemed as if the emotional side of the anime ie. Gareki's past was at times too forced, and therefore lost the effect. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters started strong, and then they pretty much stayed the same. Gareki stayed stubborn, Nai was just a strange creature with heightened sense of hearing, Hirato was always cool, Tsukumo was quiet and hard to grasp, and Karoku was a mystery til the end. The only character that had a slight development was Nagi, but that was more of a discovery of his dark side, not so much a change in him that was caused by an affect. \\n\\n\r\nSo with all the potential this anime had, it really is unfortunate that the outcome is less than satisfactory. It shows how important it is to build the characters so that you could really connect with them, and also to build a story that draws you closer to the characters. In a way I think that due to the art and sound I had higher expectations getting into this anime. And I continued to watch, curious to find out whether it would meet the level of my expectations. \\n\\n\r\nIf I were to recommend this at all, it would be to those few who are looking for a short series that is filled with detail in art and sound. Enough said. \\n",

            "content": "Ahh, Karneval. See, I'm a sucker for anime with carnival themes. So, as soon as I heard of this, it immediately became a top priority on my list. Let's see.\r\nStory (5/10) I don't like the way that Nai and Gareki were just at the same place at the same time, but I don't disapprove of it either. They make for a cute weak-strong combo. ( ^_^ ) The story and plot is not really that original. Organizations, weird mutant beings, good versus bad yada yada yada. But there is a nice enough story here. It revolves around friendships and learning to trust people despite everythingelse. \\n\\n\r\nArt (10/10) Besides the carnival theme, it is also one of the things that lured me in. I mean, look at that gorgeous art. Some people complain about the art being too colorful and bright but I personally liked the colors. It shows you exactly what's there. A not-so-serious anime, though it has its tear-jerking moments. Nuff said. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter (6/10) The characters are pretty to look at, and you'll grow somewhat attached to them. But they don't have deep personalities or something. They're don't stand out when it comes to personalities. Nai is cute and all. I love Gareki and Yogi because they are voiced by my two favorite voice actors Hiroshi and Miyano. They give you a warm feeling when you see them opening their hearts up to each other, but that's about it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10) I enjoyed it mostly because of the art and it truly has its awesome moments. You'll see if you watch. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10) I'd recommend this to anyone who wants to take a break from all the serious and dark anime that is so popular right now. It can make you smile in spite of yourself. Especially those three characters Yogi, Nai and Gareki. :)",

The animation is pretty, to sum it up, and is very appealing, and its easy to get drawn into. For the story, it was a good idea, but it was way to complex for an anime series only 13 episodes long. Even reading some of the synopsis it has, it seems pretty confusing. They tried to fit a complex story line for multiple different characters, and it just confused the crap out of me.The story was poorly told. Istill enjoyed it though, mostly because how visually appealing it was. The characters were a bit annoying at times, but they weren't boring and developed well throughout the running time.

The art looked nice and I'm an absolute sucker for a short show with amazing art and a seemingly simple plot. But instead of allowing the show's plot to fit into the 13 episode format, the writers instead attempted to build intrigue through the use of slowly revealed bits of information. While this method of easing the audience into a plot and then moving along slowly (ie establishing then breaking a pattern) works in a long form show to maintain an air of mystery, it leaves shorter showslike Karneval underdeveloped and lacking. This half baked, incomprehensible plot created a half baked, incomprehensible show.",

            "content": "Vivid colours, acrobatic movements and flashy fighting. This is Karneval, the anime about the security agency \"Circus\" and their journey to fight the criminals the police can't handle. You'll either hate it or like/love it. Depends on your preferences.\r\nStory: 4/10 - A bit messy and some plot holes, otherwise it's fair enough.\r\nThe things I dislike about the story is how the characters seems to just go with it, even if they don't know anything about each other. I asked myself \"Why do you bring him with you\" in the first episode and I can't seem to find the answer even after 13 episodes. Maybe Ihaven't looked hard enough. What I like is that the story is not overcomplicated, but still a bit mysterious at the same time. The line between too complicated and too simple is a hard one, but Karneval is edging against too simple because it's so straight forward.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is a flashy and detailed anime, with vibrant and fresh colours. The lines are premium-razor sharp, and absolutely perfect for the series. There's a lot of depth in the character designs that enhances their personalities. Lots of variety in the environments and locations. When it comes to movement animation and combats, I must say I'm blasted away. This was clearly something the producer was focused on, and it really shows in terms of quality.  I might rate this a bit high, as I am a sucker for flashy and detailed anime, so you have to decide if you like this style or not. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound effects and OST: 8/10 - Enjoyable and got the job done\\n\\n\r\nI can't think of anything that really stood out as overly positive, but there were no negatives either so I guess that makes it positive. OST's are supposed to fill the series with music without disturbing, and it did so beautifully. \\n\\n\r\nOpening: 7/10 - Beautifully animated and a song that gives me throwbacks to Death Note's \"The World\" except not as catchy\\n\\n\r\n\"Henai no Rondo (\u504f\u611b\u306e\u8f2a\u821e\u66f2)\" by GRANRODEO\\n\\n\r\nEnding: 6/10 - Cute and soft like a newly bought plush-rabbit\\n\\n\r\n\"REASON\" by KAmiYU\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10 - They could've been better written\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are mostly warm and cheerful, but you can sense there's something wrong. What I really would've liked would've been a deeper introduction of each character and how they got where they are when you first encounter them. Only two characters get that luxury, but that leaves so many questions unanswered. Unless you read the manga (like I guess most of the weeabs here do).\\n\\n\r\n* Main-character who's literally the purest and most useless thing ever: check\\n\r\n* Smart thief with a Robin Hood attitude and expertise on bombs: check (personal favourite)\\n\r\n* Elegant and extravagant leader of a government agency: check\\n\r\n* Beautiful and acrobatic supporting character: check\\n\r\n* Sweet, dorky and sensitive prince-charming: check\\n\r\n* Mysterious character that the main-character is searching for: check\\n\r\n* Super-villain organization with seriously overpowered fighters: check\\n\\n\r\nDifferent about this anime compared to a lot of others:\\n\\n\r\n* No \"filler\" fan service\\n\r\n* No underlying love triangle, but a \"family like\" environment\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10 - The lack of explanation and characters not reaching their full potential brings the enjoyment down\\n\\n\r\nYes, I loved a lot about the series, but I think the anime was simply too short. This could easily be fixed with another 13 episodes in a second season, but I guess the chances for that are slim. The lack of plot and reasoning for the choices made, brings down the enjoyment like an iceberg hitting the unsinkable ship *cough* Titanic *cough*. I mean a government organization that fights dangerous criminals suddenly listens to the dreams of a naive kid to help him search for a man nobody seems to know anything about? Makes no sense in my head. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for visually stunning graphics and an overall fair story, this might be something to dive into. The story might not be the best you can find on MAL, but it's not awful. I rate it 7/10 because the story could've been so much better with some extra hours of development and lore, but it looks like the budget went to maximize the visuals. Not bad at all, but far away from perfect.\\n\\n\r\n* Would I recommend for normal viewers? Probably.\\n\r\n* Would I recommend for critics that look beyond pretty visuals? Probably not.\\n\\n\r\nWatch it and decide for yourself if it was worth your time.",

            "content": "Karneval is rife with rich color detail, a vast plethora of characters and a kind of entertainment-based spin on your typical fight-against-the-monsters anime. The premise and the initially presented plot are very interesting, and you are thrown into the action almost immediately. The series follows the adventures and exploits of the protective combat agency, Circus, whose operatives' objectives are to stop the monsters that they believe threaten humanity. Why on earth it is called 'Karneval' instead of 'Circus' is unknown to me.\r\nFrom the get-go, the beginning is exceptionally grabbing, as, from second one, you are introduced to both main characters, as well as a clearbreed of antagonist for the next thirteen episodes. There are many questions presented, and eventually answered, but some not to the extent that would be preferably satisfying. Due to poor time management, I believe some of the bigger questions are lost in all the fancy battle work. \\n\r\nThe story is okay, but what really takes it down from a higher score is the poor time and overall plot management. A thief named Gareki and a mysterious boy named Nai are introduced as your main characters, but their stories and what makes them /them/ sometimes gets muddled in with every thing else the series tries to cover in so little time. Many of the time management problems arise from spending two whole episodes on side characters you will literally never see again.\\n\r\nEpisode-to-episode, the adventure is enjoyable to follow, at least for temporary interest, but there are many choppy side missions and admittedly, the ending feels very rushed. There is A LOT to fit in, what with the large cast of characters and the many, many conflicts the show must get through. However, almost everything is summed up in the end, and there is little you are left unsatisfied with, unless you're a die-hard plot fanatic. The relationship between Nai and Karoku, a man he is looking for, provides a very weak closer and is probably the biggest let down.\\n\r\nAlso, a warning: the anime borderlines Boys' Love, and all of your male characters cannot appear in a scene without a bit of homosexual subtext. Nothing really happens, but this is just a fair warning. Everyone is very touchy-feely.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is a wide rainbow of detail, but most of this is directed toward characters rather than the background, which is almost obnoxiously plain. Each character is developed very different so you can almost pick them out by appearance instead of by name.\\n\r\nThis stands out as a bit of a flaw.\\n\\n\r\nThere are almost too many characters packed into Karneval, most of whom are attractive men of every trope, most likely for the purpose of pleasing the female viewer. Everyone tries to be a unique member of this anime's cast, when really there is not enough time to cover why each person has a special and unique personality. Your main characters are, in my opinion, quite likable though; you have Gareki, who is your very typical stubborn-strong-silent type, and a lot of time is devoted to him throughout the series. Karneval does a splendid job of handling his talents as well as his flaws, and it is greatly appreciated. You also have Nai, who is very mysterious, but by the end of the series, I do not believe he gets as much development as he deserves. It feels almost unfinished on his end, while many of the other characters receive the closure they need.\\n\r\nA very big problem is the wide cast of side characters, all of whom are incredibly detailed but do not have full personalities to flesh them out. I cannot recall some of their names, and they do not strike me as vital to the plot, though they do not necessarily harm it.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was nothing very special; again, mostly an addition to please young teenage girl viewers and the similar. The beginning song is a bit harsh for the anime and doesn't quite capture the feel of fun that is really contained within. The ending is VERY reminiscent of some BL's I've seen, but suits the show surprisingly better. That's how close to BL it is, folks.\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment of the show sort of trailed off as the episodes went on, mostly because later episodes do not compare to the ever-flashy beginning. Halfway through I was mostly waiting for them to get to the point and worrying about how they were going to successfully rap everything up well enough for the many hours I'd wasted. That, and I was almost waiting for two of them to have sex already, given the BL vibe.\\n\\n\r\nKarneval, in terms of plot, is nothing incredibly special. You have a pretty large chance of finding a character to like, given how vary large and colorful the cast is, and may be some good ground to tackle if you trouble yourself with writing fanfiction. \\n\r\nAll in all, Karneval is strong in fanservice and I believe that is the large characteristic that I'm going to remember it by, and to all you young, hungry Free! fans out there, I believe this really is your cup of tea. \\n\\n",

The only thing i regret was that there was no romance at all, but who needs romance when you got action!!! i also liked the varuga thing and it was kind of like mixing science fiction and fantasyand something else together which made it very interesting to watch. if you like unique stuff like me you should totally watch it, if you are a girly girl and all you want is romance don't watch it, if you like epic endings and epic/evil main characters maybe you should try watching it but i don't believe you would love it, anyways\u2026the art is great the voice acting was great and yogi is cute!!!! i hope this somehow helped you humans (i believe it didn't help at all) and i hope you have an awfully beautiful day!!! bye bye",

The Varuga reminded me of the Homunculus-type creatures from Fullmetal Alchemist, as well as the strong bond between the two main characters, and in its tendency to go from bright and cheerful to very dark. And also of D-Gray Man with its innocent white-haired main character and his dark-haired protector. Then the cheery circus motif that hides darker elements reminded me of Deadman Wonderland (that one had the innocent white-haired, red-eyed child character as well).",

            "content": "I really enjoyed watching Karneval for a few reasons. One of the main reasons was because my favorite Japanese voice actor (Hiroshi Kamiya) voiced Gareki who is one of the main characters. I also really loved the colours and art, it was so pretty and very unique and the character's eyes were beautiful. Overall, it was enjoyable to watch and there were some cute characters who I really liked ( especially Yogi.) \r\nHowever, the show lacked plot and I didn't really understand the main concept of the anime. I understand that Nai was searching for Karoku but there were many missions that had no relevanceto the main plot which I found confusing. The story line was a bit pathetic and didn't really appeal to me at all. Also, there is lack of character development and all characters pretty much stay the same throughout the entire anime. I liked Yogi a lot because he was funny and made the show enjoyable. I also loved Gareki but only because he is gorgeous and is voiced by Hiroshi Kamiya who voiced Levi from Shingeki no Kyojin soooooo it kind of makes me drool. I didn't like Nai very much and he got on my nerves because he was so useless and pathetic and got way too attached to people he barely even knew. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nThe music was really fitting apart from the ending theme. I liked how it sounded like music you would hear at a carnival and the piano osts were really pretty. \\n\\n\r\nAction scenes:\\n\r\nThe action scenes were amazing apart from the fact there was no where near enough of them. I wanted to see more magic and fight scenes instead of all the talking which there was an awful lot of. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\r\nOverall, it's enjoyable and the art is really nice. Don't take it too seriously and watch it by all means. It's fun and it's only 13 episodes so it's just a nice, light thing to watch....especially if you have recently watched something like attack on titan...*cries*",
