            "content": "Kaiba is a story that begins with a young boy who possesses no memories, a locket with a blurry picture of a girl, and a hole in his chest.  From there on, it dives into a complex look at what it means to live, speaking to its audience in eclectic ambient music, flat hues, simplified textures, and caricatured expressions.  \r\nIt is a story of heartache, rejection, and despair.  It is a story of loss and of pain, and one that explores a world in which there is incalculable capacity for wrongdoing, cruelty, and evil.  It is a story that hits itsaudience with difficult and complex moral problems, yet it offers very little in the way of solace or resolution for any of the questions it raises.  It pulls no punches and promises no answers, and in doing so, retains a sense of honesty with its audience that few works of its nature posses.\\n\\n\r\nAnd yet, in spite of the horrors and sadness that the world of Kaiba is embroiled in and consumed with, the core cast of characters are simply ones who\u2014similar to each and every one of the characters they meet on their journey\u2014are struggling with the questions of how to be, and what it is that constitutes being.  In a world where memories and forms are stolen, bartered, and sacrificed as easily as clothing or food, identity becomes even more fluid and fragile than it is in real life.  Kaiba takes this theme and extrapolates it into a reality so twisted and surreal that its commentary is impossible to miss.\\n\\n\r\nCinematically, Yuasa offers a unique directorial method of presentation that draws far more from Osamu Tezuka\u2019s gekiga than from the prevailing influences of today\u2019s directors.  Yuasa\u2019s adaption of Tezuka\u2019s style goes beyond the obvious character model similarities (designed by Nobutaka Ito), infiltrating every nook and cranny of the narrative elements.  A reverence for and homage to Tezuka\u2019s method is present from settings and thematic scope down into the minutiae of presentation, particularly in shot compositions and depictions of action or psychoses that alternates between reserved detachment and unforgettable heart-pounding relevance.  The surrealistic, futuristic depiction of the thematic emphasis on the relationship and nature of individuality, consciousness, memories, and flesh could be right at home in something like \u201cApollo\u2019s Song\u201d.  The portrayals of intolerable human cruelty resultant from complex, struggling characters seem to spring right out of something like \u201cOde to Kirihito\u201d.  The heavy handed assault of dense symbols and exaggerated physical forms screams for a sense of old-school melodrama that much modern anime generally lacks\u2014or often enough, when it IS present, it is rarely ever handled with the level of versatility and adroitness that Yuasa presents in Kaiba.\\n\\n\r\nBut this is not to say that Yuasa is somehow \u201cripping off\u201d Tezuka\u2019s legendary works in any way\u2014in fact, one need not even be the least bit familiar with Tezuka\u2019s body of work in order to enjoy this program.  What maintains Kaiba\u2019s uniqueness is that, both in spite of and because of its use of Tezuka-esque elements, it ultimately offers an experience that is greater than the mere sum of its parts.  The skill with which Yuasa manipulates his characters and paces his episodes bridges the gap between the work and the audience in a way few anime series achieve; although the first episode resembles more a dream than a traditional narrative, it doesn\u2019t take long for emotional attachment to form around both the primary characters of the show (as they are sparingly revealed) and the secondary characters that pop up per episode and often disappear just as suddenly.  Much of the program retains a quality akin to something of a vague hallucination even after completion, however its narrative remains traditional enough that things like characters, plot, back story, and development are all recognizable.\\n\\n\r\nWhat begins as a fever dream or a nightmare turns out to be a cerebral quest through amnesia, psychosis, revelation, doubt, and finally trust.  Some of its mysteries are slowly unraveled explicitly, others are left to subtle allusions or drift wantonly in a haze of ambiguity.  Development of the characters involved with the story of the protagonist alternates between exceptionally subtle and heavy-handed, though often times both \u2018subtlety\u2019 and \u2018heavy-handed\u2019 development occur simultaneously.  It is most likely its themes and tone\u2014outside of the visuals, of course\u2014that will leave the heaviest mark upon its audience; Yuasa\u2019s skill at sculpting atmosphere through imagery and sound is truly worthy of recognition.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, Kaiba is not an easy series to watch.  It is one that will present to its audience powerful images with powerful connotations that are not easily shaken off by the invested viewer.  Its characters are memorable and complex.  Its visuals, no doubt the most obvious thing to distinguish it from its peers, may give false first impressions or lend to it unjustified labels of pretentiousness.  In the end, it is a work that is extremely difficult to describe in full, and one that is likely to affect each of its viewers in radically different ways.\\n\\n\r\nRecommended for fans of abstract cinema, surrealism, science fiction, Osamu Tezuka, other Yuasa works, or simply anyone looking for a short cerebral series that is nigh indescribable.",

It's because they can't be happy unless they have people below them. This show creates a whole universe around this concept and other unconventional ideals. From the anime description and genre choices for this show, and even the database picture the normalanime viewer might be a little turned off from this show. At first glance for me I quickly turned it away as I thought it was aimed toward children. Despite showing an R+ rating I also notice ratings are usually 20% correct in the MAL database. \\n\\n\r\nBut after pushing it aside for about two weeks, I finally decided to give it a shot and boy will you be surprised. Right off the start, you're heart will start racing as you follow the story of the main character. A after waking up from a daze, blade runner 'esque chase quickly follows. After the action, the main character appears to be very lost, which I'm sure most of you will feel the same way he does. This also starts a unique connection and experience between the viewer and the main character. This is where the show really starts. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing I'm sure most people will notice is the art style. You will either love it or hate it but don't let the artwork turn you away from this show. After an episode or two you will most likely appreciate the level of originality this art style brings to the plate. After i have seen over 100+ series in a three month span, this was a very welcome change to the orthodox anime styles. Dont let the simple look fool you as well, there are more than enough small details to pay attention to throughout. From the tiny memory pellets to an overcrowded storage room. Everything looks very thought out and amazing. Often you'll probably think to yourself, how the hell does Misaaki and Nobutaka make this ***t up?\\n\\n\r\nAnother false assumption was that the characters were mostly children since they have a simple child like look to them. But they are very much mature adults. The characters are are all so very likable and I owe a lot of that to the art style and the small details that they do or don't leave out. The even greater point is how Masaaki Yuasa goes to great depths to control the viewers emotions with the use of these characters. One minute, you'll hate a character, then the next you'll feel sorry for them, then you'll feel frustrated because this is almost an emotional roller coaster. Rest assured, this is a good kind of frustration (if there is such a thing). \\n\\n\r\nDefintiely &quot;don't judge this book by its cover.&quot; This point of view story was rather an interesting one and the science, technology, and hierarchy surrounding this universe was very captivating experience. There are quite a large number of allusions and ideals in every episode that got me reflecting on what I have just experienced (which I absolutely love).  I can't really compare this to any other anime show. If i had to compare the story to something, it like a telling of a blade runner/ matrix story in the eyes of Dr. Seuss. \\n\\n\r\nA great way to close this epic show would be a quote from Dr. Seuss' Yertle the Turtle:\\n\r\n&quot;You hush your mouth!&quot; Howled the Mighty King Yertle.\\n\r\n&quot;You have no right to talk to the world's highest turtle.\\n\r\n&quot;I rule from the clouds, over land, over sea!\\n\r\nThere is no nothing, NOTHING, that's higher than me!&quot;",

            "content": "Kaiba is a dystopian/cyberpunk anime. The atypical story telling and mesmerizing dystopias which are always complemented with vivid and unique artwork of the highest degree make for a highly enjoyable experience for myself. By no means do I consider these to be  flawless genres but the amalgamation of the many tropes from these genres creates a captivating experience I personally can\u2019t really find in other genre(s), so on that fact this review may be a little bias. One could argue that Kaiba itself is not a cyberpunk series but a dystopian fantasy and I could agree with that, and maybe that is why Iconsider it a cut above the rest of the cyberpunk (GitS and Texhnolyze  for instance) I've watched. It is something fresh and has a totally different approach and perspective. However I do still feel it does share many similarities that cyberpunk does, so I will still refer to it as such.\\n\\n\r\nLike any other cyberpunk and dystopian anime it is apparent from the inception that it is a society that has been totally dehumanized. In this case, to handheld chips and yellow blobs. Bodies are thrown away like old clothing and replaced on mere whims. Human life and emotion is \"seemingly\" disregarded. Which is generally the most common criticism, and maybe even point, of these genres. They lack any real empathy and it is understandable that this can deter viewers from the genre. However, this is where Kaiba truly shines. Kaiba puts the futuristic technology into a more human context and is the reason why I emphasize the word seemingly. It is an empathetic cyberpunk, that is to say, that characters express true emotions and warmth. Which is something these series generally lack (for better or for worse? that\u2019s each person's decision). It shows this empathy whilst at the same time, it is able to show the total loss of human value. To be able to show both polar opposites of this spectrum without one impacting the other is a true testament to how well done this series is.\\n\\n\r\nThe empathy is shown in many cases throughout the series, such as maternal bonds, but most notably through the two main characters that, despite not remembering each other, and being in totally different bodies, they are still drawn together and attracted to one another. It also shows the sacrifices one is willing to take to stay with their loved ones and no amount of deceit and lies will stand between characters coming together. And at heart, this really is a series about human longing and romance.\\n\\n\r\nSimilarly, the OST completely compliments and helps illustrate both the dystopian nature of the world in which Kaiba is set and also its warm empathetic side. Most notably two pieces: the  Melody of Clonico and The Tree Song. The Melody of Clonico (episode 3) really serves to illustrate the empathetic side of the series. The Tree Song holds magnificent symbolism in both a literal and metaphorical sense, and it is no surprise why this song is teased throughout the entire series becoming its \u2018staple\u2019 piece. While this may not be relevant to some, it is something I can wholeheartedly appreciate. This song illustrates the entire series as a whole in more than one way.\\n\\n\r\nKaiba's characters are fantastic for the most part. A large portion of the series can be considered episodic, meaning, Kaiba travels from one place to another and in doing so meets characters along the way that don't stay relevant for very long but they do what's required of them and are well developed enough in most cases that you genuinely care about them and what happens to them. Kaiba is a very interesting and mysterious character that at the beginning, the viewer knows as much (or as little) as Kaiba himself, who has lost his memories. As the series progresses Kaiba - and the viewer - learn more about his past which made it a very engaging experience as he slowly becomes more aware of the girl in his locket. That girl being Neiro. Neiro is also a very interesting character, who, without spoiling much, has issues of her own in regards to her memories. The most rewarding thing about the characters, namely Kaiba - but also others - is that his genuine interactions with other characters within the series brings a sense of warmth to an otherwise, overly cold and dark society.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is a love or hate relationship. It is far from mainstream and maybe even pretentious. There's not much to say about that, the animation is still fluid, the characters are still well designed and the world they find themselves in is equally well designed. I personally found it to be one of the series greatest strengths and made it an even more rewarding watch.\\n\\n\r\nKaiba is a bag of mixed emotions, on one hand it is incredibly sad to watch as human life is literally thrown away and treated like garbage, but on the other hand it is beautifully warm to see individuals stop at nothing to preserve this life and connect with their loved ones. It left me not knowing what to feel at times and I can only say that as absolute praise for the series. I am not saying this series is for everyone, it is totally understandable that if you\u2019re not a fan of cyberpunk/dystopian anime this may not be for you, but if you don\u2019t like these genres for the lack of empathy they portray, this may pleasantly surprise you. There are other reasons why this isn't for everyone, most notably, its art which as I said, is far from the mainstream. It may not be an easy watch for some, especially given the cyberpunk/dystopian tropes it has, but it is something I loved wholeheartedly.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for taking the time to read.\\n",

            "content": "Where there is a body, there is a mind. A mind that is unquestionably a part of us and remains to be this way until our eventual passing. Throughout the centuries of philosophy and science, it is one of the most utterly fascinating aspects of human existence that has yet to be explored fully. There have been many stories that have delved into the realm of consciousness as the primary plot device from the mid-20th-century science fiction authors, and anime has had its fair share of shows that are akin to this. One of which is Kaiba, a fascinating trip that shows no boundaries ofanimation and how it can use different styles in anime that have primarily been redundant at the time.\\n\\n\r\nIt is true that this type of story has not been done before. One that deals with the concept of minds and how it's our self, but with Kaiba, it's like a journey you go through with our main hero, named Kaiba. He meets different characters from his trip that all have distinct characteristics that make them stick out from the rest, who may or may not help him in his search to find his memories that have been lost after his long slumber. As we follow our likable hero, we discover how the world that Kaiba inhabits has begun to crumble under its dystopia. Although they portray the setting in a surrealist manner to give it a distinctive look, there's still the lack of any depth to the world itself. In other words, there's not enough to go around from the lack of exposition it gives to the history of this world that Kaiba has to offer, and it only succeeds halfheartedly.\\n\\n\r\nWith that said, even though the plot features some mind-bending, philosophical facets that incorporate Kaiba, the story-telling that helps guide them through the narrative is somewhat lacking. Nonetheless, when the show starts, it manages to make an excellent first impression in showing us first-hand what the world is like and how the other people who live in it go through the absolute turmoil that plagues their way of life. Some moments were even strong enough to invoke tears from my eyes. However, it doesn't take long until we cut away from the protagonist and then start going into the character back story of another named Chroniko. To explain this clearly, Kaiba implants his memories into Chroniko, and from then on we get to explore Chroniko's past and how she was brought up into the world. While this might seem admirable to make us know that there are, in fact, more than just Kaiba that might matter, I feel as though it wasn't even needed in the first place when we already have to follow Kaiba and his journey to get his memories back, even though technically he's inside of Chroniko in these scenes.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, we follow other characters such as the sheriff, named Vanilla, and his fascination with Chroniko, or in this case, the body that Kaiba inhabits. This plays off more like a desperate attempt to make the show longer. After that, we discourage entirely that whole moment that involved both of those characters, and we follow Kaiba like nothing ever happened previously. One could say that those plot arcs were necessary for Kaiba to understand the meaning of human emotion and the human condition, but it comes across as a bit trite and forgettable once the next episode rolls in.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough with that said, the conclusion to the story felt incredibly fulfilling to experience after a brilliant romantic setup between Kaiba and Neiro, who play off each other very well. Their immediate feelings for each other might seem a little cliched, but how they direct the dialogue they say to each other comes off rather fluently and feels genuine. Right near the very last frame of the previous episode, it felt like the best way to give Kaiba a sense of closure.\\n\\n\r\nBy far the most alluring aspect of Kaiba that has made it somewhat of an indistinguishable show amongst the anime community is the art and animation. Directed by Masaaki Yuasa, who also directed the classic The Tatami Galaxy and directed the animation and wrote the surrealist film Cat Soup, this man knows his way of transforming his visions into reality and making us clamor for more of his artistic creativity. Kaiba's hook from its animation relies not just on an unconventional art style, but also its seamless implementation to the story and tone it tries to convey to us. Once we see the art style which Yuasa executes on constructing Kaiba's world, the result is no less than jaw-dropping. In some areas, it might seem even a little forceful in the attempts of making things a little too wacky and cartoony, the moments where it shows how people can invade someone's memories look incredible at face value.\\n\\n\r\nThe fluid motions that the characters exhibit in the show's animation feel reminiscent of western-influence and the works of the great Osamu Tezuka. The abstract shapes of the buildings and vehicles give the show its unique identity and ultimately becomes very memorable in that aspect. There is about as much creativity as one could get from a studio named Madhouse, who's no stranger to producing shows similar in nature of Kaiba.\\n\\n\r\nOn the overall quality of the sound production, the voice acting is serviceable with the veteran voice actresses Romi Park and Mamiko Noto giving out terrific performances. Even with the limited amount of dialogue that the character Kaiba has throughout the story, Houko Kuwashima plays out the amnesiac archetype rather convincingly. Her voice emotes perfectly as an unemotional character who has lost all sense of meaning in his life because of how memories play a huge role to him and how that was perpetually lost. One thing to note in music is the opening song for Kaiba which is composed quite beautifully from the sublime electronic ambiance mixed with subtle orchestration. On top of that is the beautiful voice of Seira Kagami, giving a dazzling performance that sets a tone of pure melancholic loneliness, one of the main themes of the entirety of Kaiba.\\n\\n\r\nThere's nothing quite like Kaiba's style and finesse to be found in most anime shows. I say style as in the animation, which is the only significant aspect of the show that makes it worth watching, but that's not to say that the story is terrible by any means. There's more to be seen in Kaiba than just the art and animation; but if it was only focused a little more tightly and given more world-building for it to be memorable, this would've been ranked higher. There is no doubt people will be looking at the art style and start thinking it's nothing like anime they're used to and reject it immediately. Distinctive qualities are a rarity these days, and I'm perfectly fine with this. No doubt we need more creative measures put into the medium, but when one show comes out in that one particular season that puts a lot of effort into its aesthetic qualities that challenge the norm, then that makes that one show all the more special.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: B+\\n",

            "content": "Art - 10\r\nKaiba is visually stunning and creative.  Sometimes they trade in dynamic quality of images for free animation, and it&rsquo;s not a bad thing.  The art design is very Seussian, especially in architecture.  There is a wonderful roundness to everything, with nary a straight line in sight.  Despite the character design, there is an unexpected expressiveness in the facial animation.  There is a thoughtfulness in each character&rsquo;s appearance that is underscored by the fact that characters don&rsquo;t look anything alike unless they are twins.  The direction utilizes light and shadow brilliantly to keep the eye focused on theimportant, active pieces.  Computer animation is good, and well integrated into the show, allowing a freedom of movement in both character and cameras that many should take note.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9\\n\r\nI don&rsquo;t want to say perfect, but the music was so well done that I really can&rsquo;t say enough about it.  The ending and beginning themes really help to create this other-worldly, exploratory feeling that the viewer has while watching the show.  The most amazing part of the sound track, though is &ldquo;The Tree Song.&rdquo;  It&rsquo;s a masterpiece.  There are three versions of the song used throughout the show and it is always implemented beautifully.  It&rsquo;s varied enough that it gives meaning to many different scenes, and distinctive enough that you remember the song as a whole.  Voice acting is good on the whole.  I don&rsquo;t think there was anytime that I question choices in the acting, but no one really left an impression besides Vanilla&rsquo;s voice actor.  The voice actor for Popo also does a good job, giving a certain amount of depth and quality to such a badly handled character.  Some of the foley was very funny and charming.  Much of the sounds of spaceships flying, guns firing, and hitting target were quirky and added character to the world\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 6\\n\r\nThe characters are just ok.  Unfortunately the viewer learns so much toward the end that it becomes very overwhelming to feel like you actually know and understand each of characters and their thought processes.  Popo was interesting in the beginning, but once his motives are revealed, he is abrasively two dimensional and overexaggerated. Kaiba is quite empty.  Part of this is necessary because of the role he plays in the beginning of the show, but after a while, it becomes clear that there is no real depth to anything that he does.  While he is in Chroniko&rsquo;s body he is astonishingly unconcerned with Vanilla&rsquo;s feelings, and kind of mindlessly strings him along without a second thought.  Vanilla, though, is easily the best character in the show.  He is clearly conceived, and believably makes all of his decisions, no matter how vile or dumb the viewer may find them.  Kichi isn&rsquo;t a bad character, but again becomes important so late in the series that it&rsquo;s a shame a lot of time was wasted on other, less important, subjects.  Neiro just flat out wasn&rsquo;t competently executed, bland, and a slave to the plot 90% of the time.  The only thing notable with her was an encounter she had with Chroniko-Kaiba while she was in the body of another man.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 5\\n\r\nHad Kaiba been just a visual exploration of the world, rather than tethering itself down to an overall plot, then I think the creators would have had a better time with the story.  It&rsquo;s very clear that the show was bound by the main plot in the last half of the show.  Kaiba is centered around the title character who has amnesia, the only notable thing is that he has is a hole in his chest and a locket of a girl. This story starts as an simple idea, then leaves that thought to explore worlds in a variety of vignettes, then coming back to the main plot cashing and burning in convolution.  Characters who play an important role in the show are completely eschewed at the beginning, and are haplessly stuffed into the end leaving no room to breathe between character studies and plot twists.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 6\\n\r\nI was absolutely engaged with every moment of Kaiba in the first half of the show.  The worlds were lush, beautiful and captivating, with the focus characters of each episode enticing and conflicted.  I especially loved the dark mature tone and themes present in the series.  However, after that first half, as well put together as everything was, it was equally off kilter in the latter half.  Connections didn&rsquo;t quite read on screen when they needed to, and the ending was honestly one of the worst in my opinion.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI just finished Kaiba. I actively avoided this show last year, and after completion, I'm quite disappointed that I did. The discussion I would have had while watching it would have been fun. This is an exceptional show, yet very flawed, and I actually had to look back in the comments section after certain episodes to see if I was the only one confused with certain character/plot developments, and I wasn't. I don't think Kaiba is something you watch unless your taste level has reached a certain point, so enjoyment will definitely sway because of that. I'm torn between a 7 and an 8, but the story was just so terrible at the end that I can't give it an 8 in good conscience.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7",

            "content": "Kaiba is a Sci-fi, Adventure, Romance, Drama featuring some questionable abstract art. With such a surreal concept on &lsquo;memories&rsquo;, only those who are able to see this anime for its originality will be able to fully appreciate it.\r\nIt&rsquo;s set in a world where dying doesn&rsquo;t matter, as long as you have your memories you can be reborn into another body. This is certainly a fascinating premise and the series does a great job in raising some serious issues that arise due to this perpetual world. The story itself focuses on some guy named Kaiba, who wakes up with no recollection of anything about himself. Itseems to have a similar story telling style as the more widely known series &lsquo;Kino&rsquo;s Journey&rsquo;, where our protagonist journeys to weird and wonderful places and quickly gets involved in other people&rsquo;s live stories. Major difference is that Kaiba&rsquo;s journey actually holds a purpose, as it&rsquo;s more on a journey of self-discovery. This series has a non-linear storyline, making it is almost impossible to tell which direction the story is heading. All that&rsquo;s left is to enjoy the emotional ride of this surreal sci-fi series, though things do get a bit hectic later on.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of this series are genuinely hard to judge, not only because there are so many of them involved but because ones that truly count are very complex. For most of the first half, this series is purely episodic and the various non-recurring characters do bring something of their own to the story. Then there are the few main characters that are intricately woven into the story and you&rsquo;ll get to learn bit by bit about them and their memories. Kaiba &amp; Neiro are the most captivating of them all.\\n\\n\r\nThen there&rsquo;s the animation and most people will be wondering why I gave it such a high score. However where the animation lacks in any sense of realism or detail, it sure makes up for it with pure creativity and imaginative design. The music goes well with it, as there are a variety of entrancing tunes and melodies that will get anyone caught-up in the moment. Same goes for the sound FX, which really stands out during the amazing action sequences.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Kaiba is one of the more original anime I have come across in a while, which can truly capture many viewers. On the other hand the story is rather confusing and there are numerous issues that aren&rsquo;t made clear, although it certainly did a good job in the limited time it had. I can positively say that this series isn&rsquo;t for everyone, nevertheless if you can look past the childish animation then you may be able to appreciate this mature show.\\n\\n\r\n^_^",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**\r\nThe anime community is filled with a bunch of liars. That\u2019s right; I said it. We\u2019re liars anime fans. And \u201cKaiba\u201d is the proof of it.\r\nIf you\u2019re anything like me, then you couldn\u2019t possibly count the number of times that you see a blog entry, a forum post, an article, or some sort of outcry that complains about the lack of innovation in the modern anime industry. The market is frequently bashed for pumping out the same old otaku-pandering crap every single season and losing sight of its artistic and intellectual roots.  High school slice-of-life after high school slice-of-life is announced toa chorus of groans as we all scream \u201cI want something unique!\u201d\\n\\n\r\nWell, y\u2019know what anime fans? I call bullshit. Apparently, you don\u2019t want innovation; you want more clich\u00e9 harem action-comedies that take place in otaku-paradise fantasy worlds with badass male protagonists, because that\u2019s the only kind of thing that gets popular nowadays. You don\u2019t know what you want. If you wanted innovation, then unique masterpieces that aren\u2019t afraid to be experimental and push boundaries wouldn\u2019t somehow manage to go completely unnoticed. If you wanted innovation, Kaiba would be as popular as SAO is now. Instead, it barely cracks the top 1000.\\n\\n\r\nSo what exactly makes Kaiba such a masterpiece? Why does the fact that its only popularity stems from a small cult following of director Masaaki Yuasa (who you may know from Tatami Galaxy or Ping Pong the Animation) create such outrage? Well, that\u2019s a loaded question. Obligatory review-intro aside, let\u2019s delve into one of my all time favorite anime:\\n\\n\r\nSynopsis: In this world, technology exists that makes it possible to store human memories as data, so that the death of your body is not actually death. As memories are stored in databanks, they can be transferred into new and different bodies. Because so-called \"memory trading\" now occurs, it is now possible to steal memories, illegally alter them, sell them, etc. Good memories can be downloaded and bad ones can be erased; a luxury only available to the rich and powerful. One day, a man awakens in a ruined room. His name is Kaiba. Kaiba has no memories of his own, but he does have a lot to figure out about his past.\\n\\n\r\nBesides the artwork (more on that later), the first thing that stands out about Kaiba is how INCREADIBLE its world-building is.  Not only is it a world rich with creativity and depth, but so much about it is conveyed with so little exposition. This anime tells its story through expressions, thoughts, symbolism, and other devices that don\u2019t need to be spoken aloud more than it does through traditional methods, and that is arguably the most beautiful part about it. SO much emotion is conveyed in this twisted, thought-provoking setting that blurs the lines of ethics, morality, and individualism.  This is a very philosophical show, but it\u2019s FAR from pretentious or preachy; it rarely, if ever overtly discusses these serious topics, but rather conveys them without words. While that aspect may serve to potentially alienate viewers who don\u2019t like to think about what they are watching, to hell with them; be prepared to absorb a lot of different ideas and concepts when you watch this show. Kaiba tells a tale that not only sucks us into its universe and makes us care deeply about its characters, but it also causes us to think in ways that we likely never have before. While Kaiba\u2019s tranquil mood and bright color pallet may mask the mature nature of the show, make no mistake that this is one of the most meticulously crafted, subtly brilliant, and perfectly paced plots I\u2019ve ever had the pleasure of experiencing. There is much more I could say, but no words I come up with will ever be able to do Kaiba justice. You simply have to watch it for yourself to understand.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are my favorite part about Kaiba; it is without a doubt one of the most incredible and memorable casts of all time. There are no good guys, there are no bad guys. There are only people; people with very distinct, very moving desires, motivations, and pasts. I cared more deeply for this cast of characters then I did for any other anime cast in a long, long time. Even the episodic characters that don\u2019t get much screen time find their way into the hearts of the viewers. I\u2019m STILL in awe of how masterfully executed the characterization of the side-characters was; even people who were only around for a single episode felt so genuinely human and fleshed out. Even they, however, have nothing on the trio of Kaiba, Neiro, and Popo, who stand out as some of the most multi-faceted characters imaginable. In addition to the sheer depth of the cast, it must be noted that the chemistry between the characters is stupendous. The emotional connections that the characters make with one another are remarkably authentic and believable. In short, these characters feel human. Very human. Their respective personalities carry the show and serve as perfect vessels for the show\u2019s central themes; this is character writing at its absolute finest ladies and gentlemen.\\n\\n\r\nBy far the most controversial part about Kaiba is its artwork, but by no means should that be the case. It absolutely sickens me to think that such an experimental, refreshing, visually appealing, and one of a kind art style can be the primary reason that this show never became popular. The bold colors and lines serve the narrative beautifully as they create a fluid world full of intrigue and surrealist imagery that leave a lasting impression on the audience. I don\u2019t care that it\u2019s simplistic; as far as I\u2019m concerned, this animation is near-perfect and you will never see anything else like it. Tag on the hauntingly beautiful and mood-setting OST along with a very memorable OP/ED set and you have yourself some outstanding and uniquely brilliant production values.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion\u2026 WHY THE HELL HAS NOBODY SEEN THIS? Kaiba is one of the most unique and incredible works the industry has ever produced and yet I have not heard it brought up in a conversation so much as once. Anime fans, do yourself a giant favor and find a way to watch this incredible series. It reminded me why I am a fan of the medium in the first place. Maybe it can do the same for you.",

            "content": "The universe sits atop a house of cards, with revolution shaking at the base. And Kaiba truly does hold an entire universe in its hands. \r\nThis is Sci-Fi through and through, and every bit of it overflows with imagination and experimentation. The strongest aspect of this show is how comfortable the writers felt in their own world. They put passion into this, and tried to make something that would last in the audience's memories. Apart from any pacing or plot problems that may have arisen, this was written in confidence. None of the lesser points are because of weak willed writers unwilling to be adventurous.If you want to see something different and intriguing, I give a hearty recommendation on that basis alone. If you also happen to be a fan of Sci-Fi, well then, sharpen your knives and prepare for a feast. (Viewers with little patience should probably sit this one out though.) \\n\\n\r\nRight off the bat, Kaiba starts with a character that has amnesia, and that sends up a bunch of warning signals. Many stories with poor writing will proudly display an amnesiac protagonist because it frees up the job of writing complex personality, pre-existing character interactions, and is just a giant gateway to spoon-feed plot and exposition to the audience. But do not fear, for Kaiba never once considers being a shoddy, overused amnesia story. In fact, the amnesia is more of just a presence that is ever-looming, not overbearing. They don't waste energy trying to cover holes with it, but instead rip apart the foundations of this trope and rebuild it anew, devoting the entire premise of this show to memories. Even if the execution wasn't masterful, they plunged head first into trying something different, and of course, that is where this show excels.\\n\\n\r\nWith the whole element of memory storage and body swapping, our main character Warp actually spends a great deal of time in a cheaply made, mute body, incapable of speaking. This does suppress how much of his personality can be expressed, and in the beginning, his position in the show isn't clear. The same can be said for many of his companions. But in the same manner that silent or minimalistic films make more from less, we are given brief moments to step into the mind of Warp. Each little morsel of his character development made more savory by their rarity and good delivery.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the same cannot be said about the entire cast. Kaiba is more about the story, and does sacrifice the quality of its supporting characters for the sake of plot points. Being partially episodic, Kaiba sometimes tries to cram entire character arcs into one or two sittings. Leaving the writers to fall back on melodrama to try and relay an expansive history or grand emotions in a compressed time. It can distance the viewer from the characters and belay the intentions of the production team. In other cases, certain episodes will excel within their limited time, and give us touching, memorable characters and anecdotes. This is a fluctuation in quality that wanes over time, leaving most of the second half solidly written.\\n\\n\r\nMuch like GitS: SAC, it's less of a classical narrative, and more of a series of experiences woven together. The precision is still there, and the plot takes you somewhere, just not in the typical manner. Power, lust, greed, lies, righteousness, pain, and bonds of friendship all weave an ever tightening noose that threatens to choke the ruling class. In the world of Kaiba, human equality isn\u2019t even an afterthought, and our crew is ready to take back their dignity, and a little more for good measure. Caught in a power struggle with ever shifting tides, the weak are forever pushed further into the abyss as the strong climb upwards. Puppets and scapegoats, forced into destructive bodies and unable to feel or draw happiness, they are scattered about as simple war machines. Despite all of their artificial power, they remain true helpless souls. With minds used, battered and abused, they dwell in the deepest pit carved by humanity, and sit there alone, betrayed by others' ambitions and their own tainted memories. Kaiba performs a tragic duel between our own identity, and the persona that others sculpt for us.\\n\\n\r\nKaiba takes up residence in the \"here's what we can do with anime as a medium\" category. It's artwork contests traditional design and usually comes up on top. On the technical side of things, it goes for fluidity rather than individual details, meaning this show rarely sits still. The frames keep turning, and action, reaction, and intricacy are all captured in the animation. They can afford to do this because of the simplistic character structures and complete lack of shading. Now this is a stylistic choice, and I think it goes well with the overall atmosphere of the show. At times it's truly jaw dropping, and you get the impression that any other style of art simply wouldn't have worked for this series. On the flip side, there are a few moments where nothing is happening, the movement stops, and the magic sort of drains away for a second. However, there is something in the art department that is uncontestedly good. The CG integration is hardly noticeable at all, even when the fast, sweeping shots cover a lot of background, it looks very smooth and naturally painted.\\n\\n\r\nSticking with story over characters, the score doesn't really have any character themes that show up like in other anime. There are mostly just soundtracks to enhance the action or accompany the mood of a scene. These only show up occasionally, and for the rest of the show, and bulk of it, we're given diegetic sounds and environmental noises that usually complement the atmosphere. In this aspect, it's not the best sound editing I've heard, but most of the time there are clean transitions, good sound effects, and nothing too obtrusively out of place. The music itself is poignant. The melodies of Kiyoshi Yoshida range from whimsical to pondering melancholy, and will stay with you long after the episode has run its course. Just like with Warp's character moments, the music is withheld until it's appropriate, and when it'll be cherished most by the audience. Now, while the compositions are very good, the implementation is a bit clumsy sometimes, and it can get noticeable when songs are reused too often.\\n\\n\r\nGiven how Kaiba tries to avoid dry heaps of exposition, the dialogue is an ever occurring source of world-building. Just like the viewer, Warp is trying to absorb everything from other people and his surroundings. This calls for more intricate writing, and is very effective in synchronizing the audience with the emotions and experiences of Warp, when it works. Sadly, the first couple of episodes were still exploring this, trying to find a solid tempo and direction, and so some of the scenes can feel scripted and unnatural. This is particularly noticeable with some moments of oddly placed comedy. But again, this all gets ironed out as the episode count grows, and it becomes a much smoother ride. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is above the standard fare, but won't have you clamoring to see the actors in other roles. Everyone does their job, and they do it well, particularly one actor who does deserve special mention. Hisao Egawa knocks it straight out of the park from the very moment he appears on screen. Providing the voice of Vanilla, he steps directly into the character, encapsulating the absurd, blundering, and over-the-top personality of our not so noble sheriff.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end we walk away with a very well controlled space oddity that radiates familiarity from the writers, as if they've spent part of their lives in this future universe. A superb drama? Not quite. But an intricate story that explores outside the realm of typical series. With that in mind, this is not a show meant to be watched casually. An attentive viewer is required to get the most out of what it has to offer. If you're looking for something to put on in the background, hold off on this show until you have time to truly watch it. Otherwise, get ready for a fantastic Sci-Fi experience.\\n\\n\r\nMy final verdict for this show is a respectable 8.4",

            "content": "Memories. They\u2019re a wonderful thing, aren\u2019t they? The ability to transport our minds back to simpler times of childhood; to look back and reflect on days gone by and to appreciate the various things we did years ago, whether that was experiencing our awkward first love during adolescence, an old friend whom you used to play with as a child, or just simple family gatherings whether that be for the celebration of some kind of event be it Christmas or Thanksgiving, or just gathering around to watch a movie together. But, there are also the bad memories, that I\u2019m sure everyone has. The memories wewould want to erase from our mind, and would do so in a heartbeat if given the opportunity to do so. Our memories of past experiences, both the good and the bad, are what shapes the person we are today, and the entire theme surrounding memories has been tackled in plenty of dystopian and cyberpunk narratives in films over the years, but the one piece of media that I have seen that tackles this idea to its fullest capabilities, in the most creative and beautiful way I might add, is Masaki Yuasa\u2019s Kaiba! If you\u2019re familiar with my past reviews, then you know that I\u2019ve praised this man\u2019s works to no end, that being The Tatami Galaxy and Ping Pong, two anime that I absolutely adore, and are some of my favourites works in the entire medium, with Kaiba being no exception to that. Kaiba is a wonderfully creative endeavour with its experimental and imaginative world, setting and characters, that not only has become one of my personal favourite anime as of late, but is a delightful reminder of why I love animation so much, and all of the endless creative potentials it can bring along with it, culminating in a work that emotionally moved me in ways that no other anime or film has been able to in a long time. It\u2019s like if Masaki Yuasa, smoked a ton of drugs and Kaiba\u2019s unique visuals was the product of his hallucinations. Anyway, with that all said and done, let\u2019s dive into the mad world that is Kaiba!\\n\\n\r\nSet in a world in which one\u2019s memories can be stored in small devices known as \u201cchips\u201d, people can live on, even when their body has lived passed its physical limitations, or has been badly destroyed, and have their memories implanted into another host, thus living on. In addition, the inhabitants of the world of Kaiba can chose to have their memories altered in several ways, adding new happier memories, or removing those memories that are too painful to bear. However, this comes at a catch, as only the rich and powerful can afford to transplant their memories into new hosts, with them ruling from the top, whilst the rest of the world is left at the bottom, a world without authority, in which the illegal alteration and trafficking of bodies and memories runs rampant. In this world, our main protagonist, Kaiba, travels throughout the land, with no memories of his own, as he meets new people and encounters new planets, eventually gaining his memory once again.\\n\\n\r\nKaiba\u2019s narrative can essentially be split into two halves; the first of which deals with Kaiba in a more episodic narrative structure as he travels from planet to planet, meeting new people, learning about their experiences and the world, with the second half becoming more plot-heavy involving a resistance group fighting against the tyrannical rule of Warp, the ruler of this world. Now, it is not my proactive to insinuate that you have to wait several episodes for Kaiba to \u201cget good\u201d or more plot-heavy. I\u2019d argue in fact that the first half of the series is more emotionally heavy in many ways than that of the second half, with each episode being its own self-contained emotional rollercoaster, all of which were able to resonate with me on some kind of emotional level. Every character Kaiba meets in the first half of the series, despite their simplistic characters as a whole, are still able to convey a wonderful story in their own respective episodes, packing an insane emotional punch at the climax for each one. Every episode explores something different about the world, and adds on to our understanding of said world, and the sheer number of themes and ideas that is pumped into the show, all the while allowing each respective theme time to develop and breath, is staggering and a true testament of the writing of the series. From episodes in which one has to come to the reality of losing a loved one, and having to come to grips with that loss, to a deeper look and understanding of sexuality and gender, and what this truly means when we see both Kaiba, whom now has moved his memories into a woman\u2019s body, and another character, whom he meets, who has done the opposite, to how memories are stored in this world, and how they\u2019re managed. Each episode in the first half the anime is rich in themes and ideas, and keeps building on our understanding of this world, and the way in which it operates, all of which I found to be deeply interesting! It deals with the loss of loved ones, the valuable nature of memories, the cost at which humans are willing to prolong their own, and their loved ones lives, and manages to tell captivating stories around these ideas, with characters that have boat loads of heart. While one may argue that I am being manipulated into feeling something for these characters, through the use of an emotional backstory, something that I myself have complained about in other shows before, but the characters in Kaiba never came across to me as if they were designed as a means of manipulating my emotions. Each one is grounded in their stories, and the fantastic writing and character interactions, as well as their clearly defined personalities, makes them feel incredibly human and real to me, so that when any unfortunate event does occur, I feel the emotional weight the show is trying to convey, and it\u2019s the main reason why I can get so invested in the world and the characters, so much so, that some episodes even brought me to tears! (Real men shed tears when watching cartoons, okay!)\\n\\n\r\nIn addition to all this, the world and setting of Kaiba, and all of the locales he travels to within the first half the story, are incredibly memorable, all of whom take on such vivid personalities in my mind. Not only is this incredibly effective at worldbuilding, but the extremely well-designed locals also help me become more invested in the show I am watching, and this also extends to the creative technology the show is filled with too, from belts that can grow legs to help move past terrain quickly, to a strange looking gun that is capable of melting bodies with one simple blast! In addition, during these episodes, Kaiba will often use a similar sort of gun, in order to gain access into their memories and their subconscious. It\u2019s used as a creative way to inform the audience about the psychological implications each character is facing, while laying down the ground work in order to give the audience subtle little hints into Kaiba\u2019s past, making the process of learning about his complete backstory in the second half, feel that more gratifying and satisfying. Each creative element in the show, from the setting to the technology, is used to enhance the narrative, and its clear how much love and thought was placed into making the world as wonderfully unique as possible.\\n\\n\r\nThe narrative is also just incredibly satisfying to watch play out, with constant forks in the road and plot twists to keep things interesting, and to constantly keep me second guessing. It\u2019s that feeling of satisfaction you get when watching a mystery play out, and seeing all the pieces come together in your mind that you say to yourself, \u201cah!\u201d as a cartoony light-bulb pings above your head. Kaiba in a way, is a mystery narrative, with Kaiba attempting to learn about the true nature of where he came from, and who he is, which comes to fruition in the second half, where the constant questions we were posed with in the beginning get answered. This mainly functions as a means to get the audience invested in Kaiba as a character, and all of the constituent characters in his past too, but I believe that by starting Kaiba with no knowledge of the world or how it works was greatly beneficial to the overall story. Much like how Kaiba knows nothing of this world, neither do we as an audience member, and we experience the world through his eyes. Everything Kaiba experiences and feels, so do we, and not only does this make the emotional moments all the more hard hitting, but it helps us get invested in this character and feel as if we\u2019re really embarking on a journey with him. Information about the world therefore, is offered through the visuals and what Kaiba sees, allowing the audience to try and piece things together, and I believe this is particularly effective in the first episode in which Kaiba watches from afar, the activities of the people of this world. Through their actions, and behaviours, we understand a lot about this world, and the circumstances of what it is like to live there, from seeing a couple having a fight, whereupon the woman walks out proclaiming she has had enough of this world (which sounds a lot like Tommy Wiseau now that I think about it; I swear that was not my intention when I wrote the first draft for this), to a group of people rummaging through memory chips, and selling those they do not want anymore, to an old man who tells Kaiba he has seen the entire world, for it to be known to us, by his wife pulling him away, that none of that has happened, and that he has gone Senile for living in this place for so long. All of these little things help to paint a picture of the world at large without having to resort to expository dialogue, and this may seem like a pedantic thing to praise, but its small little things like this that I notice and end up appreciating. It\u2019s going that little extra mile, is what makes a show truly special to me, and Kaiba is full of this!\\n\\n\r\nKaiba\u2019s characters are also great, and, as I\u2019ve already expressed greatly in regards to the people whom we meet in the first half of the series, all of whom, despite being rather simplistic, still are able to resonate with me emotionally. One of the better examples, is Vanilla, a character that falls in love with our protagonist Kaiba, after Kaiba transfers his memories into the body of a girl in the third episode. While Vanilla is most regulated to be the bumbling idiot, with a gut the size of a house, and is a complete asshole, this fat bastard did actually manage to make me cry in the seventh episode of the show. He genuinely cares for that of Kaiba (now in the body of a girl called Chroniko) and he even remarks that he is not able to save his mother anymore, as he had been holding her memory chip this entire time, suggesting a more compassionate and caring person then we were lead to believe at first. Kaiba\u2019s other characters, particularly those whom we meet in the second half in the resistance group against the rich high above are hard to talk about without going into spoiler territory, and I don\u2019t want to rob any of those who haven\u2019t seen Kaiba yet of their charm and overall impact in the story. What I will say, is that the relationships between some of the characters, namely that of Kaiba\u2019s and Neiro\u2019s, fills natural and organic, as if they\u2019re really two people who genuinely care deeply about one another, making the events that happen between them, all the more emotional to me, since I was deeply invested in both of them as actual people.  \\n\\n\r\nAs previously mentioned, the world of Kaiba is amazing, and that also extends to the animation as well. Kaiba utilises so many different animation techniques, and is constantly changing its style during much of its runtime; it\u2019s a visual orgasm! It\u2019s also a show that nails the more cartoony-esque art style, with plenty of stretch-and-pull for that cartoony sort of aesthetic and vibe, with some of the most memorable and interesting character designs I\u2019ve seen from an anime as well. The more childlike imagery and designs, also contrasts well with the more adult-oriented themes, mainly of the cruelty of the world, a tone and juxtaposition I liked a lot in the show. There are even plenty of times when the animation can downright be stunning, such as in the case where Vanilla and Choroniko are represented as two brightly lit neon coloured figures in the night sky. The entire show is dripping with personality and it\u2019s clear how much passion and work was put into the animation. One little feature I also loved was the scale of the world in regards to the size of the characters, and helped to insinuate the difference in power and class between that of the rich and that of the poor. The music, likewise, is also wonderful. The opening track, Never, is nothing short of what I would call beautiful, with its soft, almost melancholic at times, lyrics and singing. Other tracks I adored were Planets, Initialise me and Twinkling Photon. Every track in Kaiba is wonderfully composed and each track I can recite in my head with no problem; they\u2019re that memorable to me, setting the atmosphere for each locale, bringing each one to life! (Also, is it just me, or does the track \u201cChase to it!\u201d sound like something that would fit right at home in the original Terminator movie?)\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, if it weren\u2019t evident by now, I love Kaiba! While I dislike using this term, for any piece of media to describe anything, considering how incredibly subjective it is, I feel as if it is necessary for this show, and that is that Kaiba is a beautiful work of art. Through it\u2019s amazing world, characters, charm and personality, Kaiba was a series I was able to get deeply invested in whilst watching, and I loved every second of this show. It succeeds in every area, telling a rich and powerfully emotional story, and while some of the characters Kaiba meets in the first half can be rather simplistic, I believe that the writing is strong enough to salvage such characters, grounding them in a sense of believability and realism. Kaiba checks off all of my boxes for what I look for in anime, and just proves even more why Masaki Yuasa is one of my favourite auteurs in this medium, with his \u201cbig three\u201d (that including the show I\u2019m currently talking about, Tatami and Ping Pong) being some of the best works in anime, in my humblest opinion, and I\u2019d recommend checking out all three if you have not done so already. Kaiba is a show that I won\u2019t be forgetting any time soon\u2026\\n",

            "content": "There's a scene in the first episode of Kaiba where our main character sits in the main foyer of this small community, watching as various bits of human drama happens around him. This scene is a lesson in introductory worldbuilding. Kaiba is an extraordinarily complicated science fiction world in which bodies are disposable and one can acquire a new body by transporting your mind from one to another. You infer all of that from a series of scenes in which some people are trying to work out which person's mind is installed on each of these new memory chips. Other people walk past complaining theytheir friend has changed since getting their new body, while another family moans and complains that they've got to share this cheap, immobile body because they're too poor to afford better ones. It's a brilliant piece of writing and directing that manages to divulge the information you need to understand the world while telling small individual funny stories in the process. It's the massively preferable alternative to the infodump many other shows choose.\\n\\n\r\nThat scene in the opening episode sets up largely what Kaiba is about. This is a world in which both bodies and memories can be bought and sold and what sort of scenarios would happen if that was the case. A young girl sells her body to a rich collector with her mind being put temporarily in storage so her family can feed themselves. A very strange person sticks her mind into another body so she can have sex with her own body. As our amnesiac main character travels from planet to planet with only a very vague goal in mind (with half of that time in the body of a mute inflatable hippo) we see this vast universe and what weird ways society reacts when these scientific advances occur. It is science fiction at its absolute best in that regard. With these scientific advances it shows how it changes the world, from the rich to the poor, from the old to the young, from the charitable to the selfish, from love to hate.\\n\\n\r\nThe best episode of Kaiba is where he visits the super rich planet where people are buying and disposing of bodies within weeks as the newest ones come into fashion. The streets are lined with advertisements for the latest bodies of varying ridiculousness and impracticality. People strut down catwalks with their new five-limbed, three-headed bodies. The latest and hippest body fashion trend is decided by Patch, a genius artist who designs bodies for a living. However when our main character visits Patch, it turns out he is a mad old creature cut off from the world. He hates the rampant spending of the upper class and he tries to punish them by designing increasingly impractical and stupid looking bodies. As soon as those bodies are put into mass production though, advertising immediately sells them as the next big thing and we see people walking the streets with those very bodies Patch just described as horribly impractical and stupid.\\n\\n\r\nIt's an absolutely genius episode in so many ways. Like the best science fiction it shows that as much as science might change, society will still act in pretty similar ways. The more things change, the more they stay the same. Patch's creation of impractical bodies mocking the upper class who then proceed to buy them anyway without understanding the irony reminds me of rich people spending millions on Banksy art pieces. A bunch of those are specifically targeting the follies of the upper class and their wasteful approach towards spending money on the impractical, yet there they are buying those exact street scrawled art pieces. There are other little pieces of genius in that episode, such as the fact people live by eating the processed scraps of old discarded bodies, or that one of the more popular designed bodies is based on an attractive terrorist that has been on the news lately, or that Patch has a little dog he cobbled together from bits of thrown out older dogs \"because they want foreign dogs that look better than the local ones\". The levels of social commentary Kaiba creates from its science fiction is masterful.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately Kaiba has an overarching story and that's where it all starts to fall apart a little. The story in concept is pretty good actually, because it draws from the same \"what if\" scenario the rest of the small stories draw from. It's basically a love story in which two Romeo and Juliet styled characters from different societies fall in love and somehow stay in love even when they change bodies, have both their minds altered and are told to kill each other. It's a touching story about the POWAH OF LURVE that Kaiba manages to do an excellent job of exploring for the first two thirds of the series, but really starts to fuck it up towards the end. It starts to introduce too many characters with their own little desires and stories who start to take up more screentime. Some of these stories are interesting but they try to cram in too much into too small a time. There's only 12 episodes in Kaiba and the first 8 episodes of this are individual episodic stories. There are only 3 characters that truly matter and if they could cut out all the ancillary bullshit we would have had a much better and more satisfying conclusion that I would have been able to follow.\\n\\n\r\nThe last two episodes in particular are pretty awful. Kaiba basically turns into End of Evangelion. No really, when I say End of Eva I really mean it. One character wants the world to become one mind so they stop feeling pain anymore and then a whole load of imagery happens that's impossible to follow and then at the end everyone ends up on a beach looking confused. It's way more hopeful and positive than End of Eva's tirade of hate and self-loathing. Instead of feeling confused and dirty like you've just swam through a sewage infested river like End of Eva, at the end of Kaiba you feel confused but mildly content like you've just been swimming through a sea of dandelion seeds. I saw Kaiba back in 2008 when it first came out and I remembered the ending being a letdown, but rewatching it really brought into stark relief what an awful ending it has. It's a shame because the rest of the show is one of the best implementations of science fiction in any piece of fiction ever. I would still highly recommend people watch it. Just be prepared for a confusing and unsatisfying ending.",

            "content": "[INTRODUCTION]\r\nKaiba is a show that everyone should watch. Not because anything that it does story-wise is particularly spectacular, but because of how fundamentally different it is from everything else in terms of raw artistry with its music and visuals. It's not an outstandingly good show, but everything that it presents to the viewer is just so damn unique and interesting that I can't help but recommend it. The concept itself may not be original, but the execution certainly is, and it's the execution that makes this show worth watching.\r\nSTORY [5/10]\r\nKaiba takes place in a world where people can transfer their minds between each other's bodies.It explores the consequences of doing so by showing how various characters' lives are ruined by the cruelty of this society. The hero is an amnesiac who finds himself under attack in a mysterious room, holding a locket which contains the picture of a girl who is a wanted terrorist. Although interesting, the premise itself is nothing new. What makes it stand out in Kaiba is the overall atmosphere of the show.\\n\\n\r\nWhile most cyberpunk shows would go for an action-packed, thrilling adventure story about a group of rebels overthrowing this system, Kaiba instead focuses on the more intimate and emotional aspects of the mind-swapping process, for better or for worse. The first half of the series is very episodic in nature, a collection of slightly connected fables each focusing on a different cast of characters and how they have been touched by the mind-swapping technology. These episodes are very, very sad, sometimes so much so that it can be difficult to suspend one's disbelief. Additionally, these episodes are very hit-or-miss. Some are great, and some aren't. Although some characters are easy to get emotionally invested in, others just kind of exist and force you to sit through their episode, hoping that the next one will be more interesting.\\n\\n\r\nAs the story progresses and more information about our hero's past is revealed, a plot begins to take shape, ditching the episodic structure around episode 9. At this point, lots of unexpected, bizarre, and exciting things happen. If you haven't been paying close attention, it may be difficult to understand or enjoy what is going on. It's worth noting that some viewers have complained that the ending of Kaiba feels \"rushed,\" but I didn't have this problem. Some of the twists near the end do, however, have a habit of feeling forced or random, which can be a problem if you already had trouble suspending your disbelief through the episodic portion.\\n\\n\r\nBy the way, this show is not for children. It's confusing, violent, depressing, and sexual. The character designs might look cute, but, as many anime fans know, this means nothing in regard to how the actual story will play out. If you're looking for a family-friendly show, find something else.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS [5/10]\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Kaiba are defined by their experiences, not their personalities. Much like the episodes themselves, not every character is immediately interesting. Many of the characters carry their own episodes - if you like a character, you'll probably like their episode. If not, well... tough luck. Because their personalities aren't as developed as their backstories, no characters are especially memorable or unusual, and a few of them are difficult to sympathize with, which is a grave flaw in a tragedy-based show. \\n\\n\r\nThe most interesting thing about the characters is that they don't have static designs. Because of the mind-swapping sci-fi shenanigans which are always present, you'll see different characters using a single body at different times, single characters hopping between many different bodies, and personalities shifting seemingly at random. This is difficult to get used to at the beginning, especially because many of the characters' personalities aren't immediately apparent, and you will probably need a sheet to keep track of whose mind is in whose body at any given time.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of character relationships, the main focus is on the romance between Warp and Neiro, which is interesting because of how they love each other even through different bodies. Much like a Makoto Shinkai film, Kaiba dwells on the bittersweet separation between two lovers - something that I've never cared for, but that I can't deny is an intriguing aspect of the story.\\n\\n\r\nART [9/10]\\n\\n\r\nStudio Madhouse is known for the quality of their artwork, but they really outdid themselves here. Rather than using traditional anime character designs, they opted for a much more avant-garde style, one reminiscent of mid-20th century American cartoons. The drawings in Kaiba are heavily stylized, soft, and round, looking almost like they were shaped out of play-doh or drawn by a child. Rather than feeling lazily put-together, this only makes the characters all the more endearing. There is a certain human frailty which is conveyed through the use of these designs, one that enforces the story's themes much better than most anime artwork could.\\n\\n\r\nThe simplicity of the character designs also allows for the animators to do much more with their movement. Even by Madhouse standards, the action is especially fluid and captivating, and a surprising amount of emotion can be conveyed through simple facial expressions and body language. This is, of course, all thanks to the talent of Misaaki Yuasa, the avant-garde directorial genius behind The Tatami Galaxy and Ping Pong: the Animation.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the characters look small, fragile, and easily moved by their environment, the backgrounds are a stark contrast in their imposing nature, characterized by towering cliffs and tiny windows carved into the walls of threatening castles and spaceships. The oppressive feeling given by the backgrounds really adds to the story's overall emotional impact, and Kaiba would feel incomplete without the art presented in the way that it is.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND [8/10]\\n\\n\r\nMy favorite part of this show was its soundtrack. Kiyoshi Yoshida and Seira Kagami did a wonderful job with the OP, which remains among my favorites for its soothing, simplistic, and somehow still emotionally rich melody and instrumentation. The soundtrack makes very good use of synthesizers and non-acoustic noises to heighten the mysterious, sci-fi vibe that the show gives off, and it thankfully stays hauntingly beautiful because it never goes overboard with loudness or complexity. My only complaint is that there were only a few different songs used in the show - as great as many of them are, they can get old after a few listens.\\n\\n\r\nNot the OP, though. That will never get old.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT [5/10] -- FINAL SCORE [6.4/10]\\n\\n\r\nWhile I can certainly appreciate how unique Kaiba's artwork is, it occasionally left me feeling a bit more alienated than I believe was intended. On the personal side of things, I've never been much for romances or gratuitously emotional dramas, so there were parts of the show that I just couldn't enjoy as much as I feel most viewers would. Nonetheless, Kaiba is an anime that I'm not likely to forget anytime soon, and is one that everyone needs to watch.\\n\\n\r\nAlso recommended: Flip Flappers, Serial Experiments Lain, The Tatami Galaxy",

            "content": "Great works of art are not easy to review. They are not common like the cesspool of bad art. Bad art is easy to deconstruct, to show how pathetically horrible they are. \u201cSo bad it\u2019s good\u201d exists because these works are so bizarre, so extraordinary that they become unique. Bad art is never unique its badness. In contrast, great works of art always end up redefining what \u2018good\u2019 is, so any review of a masterpiece will never be analytical and conclusive. It always end up chasing something that we can only grasp a piece of, like a poet looking at a beautiful line he wroteand knowing he can never write a worthy poem of it.\\n\\n\r\nKaiba is one of those artworks. I say it deliberately. Judgment of it is not confined to anime. It transcends media, reaches something so deeply human and awe-inspiring that it becomes a part of you. Do not expect a rational explanation of why this anime is better than pretty much anything. If we understood completely why it\u2019s so good, we\u2019d have masterpiece dropping from the skies. I can try, though.\\n\\n\r\nThe key to understanding Kaiba is understanding how it tells a story, specifically how it takes advantage of the personal nature of fiction. All art, including fiction, is personal. It is a product of human thought, a translation of your entire Being \u2013 your experiences, philosophy, unconscious, passions \u2013 into some kind of experience that another being can take on. Kaiba is a ridiculously expressive work. Every scene is imbued with emotion. Every object says something about what it represents. It\u2019s so emotionally draining because of that.\\n\\n\r\nMemory is the big topic, but Kaiba isn\u2019t just about memory. In a cliched way, it\u2019s existentialist, asking what we are. Its answer is memories, but memories are also information. The anime explores this intersection of information that defines us. Notice the symbols. When memory isn\u2019t converted to information, it is organic and free \u2013 it is lifelike memory eggs. These are also tiny, fragile and fleeting. The memories float away and are easily lost.\\n\\n\r\nThe roe is us, so they use to show how tiny we are when death strikes. When a character dies, their bodies become liquid and vanish completely. The \u2018self\u2019 becomes just a bunch of yellow pieces floating way. It expresses the loss of death, how death completely erase us and we become nothing. The memory chip \u2013 a drill-like thing \u2013 can also die so easily, if it\u2019s lost it\u2019s gone forever. Sure, we can try to capture those roe or to protect the chip, but it\u2019s so difficult. It\u2019s an expression of how fragile we are.\\n\\n\r\nYet converting ourselves into information makes us so much easier to control, and easier for us to control others. Altering other people\u2019s memories is a sci-fi trope, but this anime is concerned with how it affects everyone, how it affects our personal lives. We see the small results of this \u2013 how erasing someone\u2019s childhood erases who they are and they end up becoming nothing but a memory. How this power to change personal reality blurs into thinking we can change reality itself \u2013 a direct link to megalomania and tyranny.\\n\\n\r\nOur memories are our personality. Once we control them, edit them, change them all lines break down. The world of Kaiba looks funny by design, but that\u2019s because how the people experience it. People can also put their memories into a whole new body. In one episode this results in a world where bodies are manufactured like clothes. Its reality is grotesque, a mass of weird shapes that\u2019s disorientating. Somehow we ended up creating a more chaotic reality than nature.\\n\\n\r\nLeaning towards a socioeconomic critique of society, the anime shows a world in which memories \u2013 selves \u2013 become products. So a character sells her own body with hopes that her memory will be kept. Selves are no longer precious. This society isn\u2019t painted with strokes of black to show you how evil rich people are. Rather, to illustrate the chaos of it, we see selling your own body and putting yourself in a chip is no guarantee. You\u2019re relinquishing control of yourself, your grip on the world.\\n\\n\r\nYet this \u2018information\u2019 is never just \u2018information\u2019. Consciousness was the result of accumalating all these pieces of data and connecting them. So we\u2019re never really dead, and using memories this way is using people as objects. The anime is deeply concerned with living things. In a gallery of memories, the people who own these memories cry out to be released.\\n\\n\r\nEveryone\u2019s concerns are always personal. Although the characters are simple, they have motivation and a humanity. A sheriff who really wants a girl at first seems like a greedy bastard, but he\u2019s a person. That\u2019s his wants, and when we see this want doesn\u2019t make him just an asshole but a good person we\u2019re encouraged to sympathize with him. In the end, he\u2019s a \u2018human\u2019 being \u2013 with people he loves, things he wants, and dreams lost when death comes.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough there are antagonists, the series always reminds us that they\u2019re people in the most simple way. People want power, but not because they\u2019re evil. They want it because they\u2019re human beings, so we see the ringleader of the resistance crumbling to tears when he realizes what he\u2019s done. He had to erase memories that painted him in a bad light, but the result was losing a friend.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is in the end about treasuring people. The idea of memory is just a tool to show us how we can lose people, no matter how hard we work to keep them. We put their identity, their whole being in a chip but then that chip is lost. We sell a loved one\u2019s body, hoping the salesman will keep the information in a chip. A friend blocks our ambition, so we erase some memories only to realize the whole person is gone. Eventually this anime reaches an important conclusion about being \u2013 we need each other, we\u2019re social animals, power doens\u2019t make up for it.\\n\\n\r\nThe castle of Warp is a lonely place. The only person he has is an all-seeing robot. He\u2019s not happy and the only thing he can talk about are who to execute. He may be the king of memories, but these are his own memories. What good are they? In a beautiful scene Popo and the resistance at the palace, and it has a huge opening to a black void. That\u2019s the height of power to you, a lonely high place looking out into nothing. The only thing that\u2019s there are themselves, yet they\u2019re craving control.\\n\\n\r\nThe romance between Neiro and Kaiba isn\u2019t a symbol for romance, but what\u2019s really important \u2013 connection. Even during oppression, they found something of their own, a precious shared memory that\u2019s enough. Separate yourself from the struggle for power. The privileges of the rich to put themselves in memory chips and live forever aren\u2019t that worthwhile in the end. Every world touched by this is grotesque, people are lost yet they are still people.\\n\\n\r\nYou cannot talk about the art without mentioning the Neverhood, which seems like a direct inspiration for the anime. Both endings and beginning borrow from it. It opens with a man seeing an unknown, bizarre world. The ending includes a darker version of the hero and a gigantic, self-sacrificing robot. Like the Neverhood, the design is cartoonish, nonsensical and imbued with meaning and emotions. Look at the planet where the only thing that matters is the story of two old people. The planet itself is nothing but their tower. The underworld is almost colorless \u2013 but almost, since it still has some life in it. The club is colorful and weird but has a dominating shade of purple \u2013 a disorientating effect. Vanilla looks like what we expect from an asshole with the fat belly and aggressive face (Only his character later proves to be more). There is even a creature who flies by a propeller and doesn\u2019t speak \u2013 like the sidekick from old video games. It\u2019s as unrealistic as you get, but no scene is without emotional overtones just like life \u2013 and that makes it far closer to reality than anything else.\\n\\n\r\nLikewise the soundtrack couldn\u2019t be better, a collection of gentle electronic sounds. It fits with the slightly childish designs, but it has the same fragility of the world. A lot of it sounds like Boards of Canada, only it takes it to less nostalgic tones. The soundtrack mostly expresses a reflective, introspective atmosphere, one of both awe and terror. Some tracks are colder and harsher that reminds us that this world is still harsh, a world where selves can be sold. Some tracks have beautiful, intimate melodies to go along with the theme of connection.\\n\\n\r\nThere is no other anime like Kaiba, an anime so expressive, where every shot is charged with emotion, wonder, terror and humanity. \u2018Depth\u2019 isn\u2019t the right word. It\u2019s not an intellectual, symbolic exercise like Paranoia Agent or a psychological exploration like Digimon Tamers yet it\u2019s somehow better than these two. Perhaps because it takes anime to the origin of art \u2013 the expression, not explanation, of human experience. Nothing I could write would do this anime justice.",

            "content": "This review spoils the entirety of Kaiba and is advised only for those who have completed the series.\r\nOf Masaaki Yuasa's main three anime series (Kaiba, The Tatami Galaxy, and Ping Pong the Animation), Kaiba is arguably the most ambitious but also the most flawed. It weaves an overarching story while gradually building upon the distinct world it's set within, but along the process struggles with particular plot points being rushed, questionable actions, particular occurrences insufficiently explained, and particular contrivances. \r\nThe ways in which Kaiba is able to expand upon its world while maintaining a level of imagination often uncommon in the anime medium is itsstrongest point. Paralleling it's cartoony art-style, many of Kaiba's sci-fi concepts are almost childishly simple, but this is in fact a commendable approach. It doesn't try to thoroughly explain the mechanisms of its world through info-dumps and rather chooses to show the viewer how the devices of the world work. To maintain the wonder of the concepts themselves, the series doesn't mechanics that don't need to be explained. From individuals removing chips and transferring someone into another body to scanning one's memory with a device and jumping into his/her mind to teleporting from room to room by stepping on a floating sphere, we get to witness all of its sci-fi concepts in action. We're shown this all naturally through the actions of Kaiba's characters without taking time to spoon-feed the reader all the information, thus enhancing the experience.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the moment the main character begins exploring the world, the series establishes how the world shapes the mentality of its inhabitants. We see the despair of a family trapped within a cube, unable to experience the world with a real body. We notice attempts to limit the number of people who can inhabit an area with a body for pragmatism. We see a woman striving to escape her current life after winning a new body. Small touches of visual storytelling such as a man's failure at pretending to be a child's brother in order to obtain a body and his cover being blown when thanking the wrong child are well appreciated and serve as natural means of showcasing the deceit that can be present in such a world. Kaiba is the type of series to not hold back on harsh realities. Rather than present a childlike idealistic notion of a world in which memories are fickle and bodies can be manipulated, it depicts the class struggle that would naturally exist in such a world. The rich prosper and live on with near endless potential in what they may do with the manipulation of bodies and memory, while the poor struggle to even thrive in a body. An electrolytic cloud was built to separate the poor from the rich, and those in poverty have  resolved to break through the cloud, even when the inevitable result is failing and losing their memories.\\n\\n\r\nWe can further see the tendency  of impulse, deceit, and denial as we embark through Kaiba's world alonside the titular protagonist. The woman whom Popo sends Kaiba on the ship in episode 1 uses Kaiba's body for her own sexual impulses, loading her memory onto Kaiba's body for pleasure. The depiction of this sexual portrayal is gruesome, and some may be deem this event far too excessive for the series, but it demonstrates the lengths that some individuals may take in such a world and thus is a worthwhile inclusion. Butter's using of various women for his smuggling of memories serves to portray more of the deception inherent in such a world. Vanilla maintains order as a sheriff, but we see he's driven more strongly by his lust for a beatiful woman. Through him we further see the rules enforced within such a world, such as copies of individuals having no right to harm their originals and individuals being free to harm copies. Certainly questionable rules, and pragmatism is raised yet again when the copy within Kaiba's body is spared only so  that the body could be sold to the collector Cloak.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 3 further supports the harsh reality of such a world, but it also showcases that there's more to the conflict of characters within this world than mere selfishness. Chroniko's memories being disposed of when selling her body poses the risks and uncertainties that can arise in such a world of deception, but it doesn't depict her aunt Negi  as wholly evil. Negi attempts to convince herself that she's justified in selling Chroniko, providing the excuse that she has provided enough for her and that Chroniko isn't her true daughter. But as she reflects upon what she went through to provide Chroniko her boots and takes joy in remembering playing piano with her, she cannot mask her genuine love for Chroniko, consequently grieving over the decision she had made. Although the characters of Kaiba may be driven through selfish ambitions, they are after all still people, and Negi's conflicts represents what playing with the memory of others can entail. \\n\\n\r\nEpisode 5 serves to showcase the role of consumerism in such a world. Individuals are more focused on what they can attain for accessories rather than what is truly necessary. Through the story of the robot Patch, we see his ambition in righting the wrongs of Alibiba's consumerism desires. Path's inventions were responsible for such excessive consumerism, but he built those inventions out of necessity rather than personal satisfaction. As such, he resolved to sabotage his creations in rebellion. Unfortunately his limited battery prevents him from succeeding in each attempt, and he loses all memory before recharging. As a result, all his attempts to combat the toxic consumerist tendencies of the masses is in vein. And thus we see the struggle of a character seeking to correct the world when in reality he's only admired for the problem he creates.\\n\\n\r\nThrough its episodic format in the first half, the series fleshed out the world through these aforementioned elements but it is also respect-worthy for how it built up its overarching story throughout its episodic format. Episode 1 already showcased Popo's desire to kill Kaiba in front of the skonk, and Hal's role in delivering Hyohyo onto the ship, both central to future reveals. The announcement of Neiro blowing up the memory tanks in episode 2 established the introduction of the Issoudan and suspense over what the relationship between Kaiba and Neiro could be. The end of episode 5 revealed the king of memories warp, leading the viewer to question the significance of Kaiba being given the name warp. Episode 6 established the memory-eating kaiba plant and Kaiba's interactions with Neiro. And episode 7 wrapped up Kaiba's journey with Vanilla, closing the episodic half of the series. Although the focuses shifted throughout the episodic portions, the series maintained a sense of continuity. For example, Kaiba and Vanilla being chased after in episode 7 was directly due to their involvement with Neiro. \\n\\n\r\nWith sufficient setup from these episodes, the series focused on its more ambitious central story. The Issoudan's movement to oppose all manipulation of memories was established more thoroughly, Kaiba and Neiro's past together was revealed, and motivations were provided for all of Kaiba's characters. This focused story of Kaiba was surely ambitious, but it also resulted in the majority of the issues with the show's execution. Firstly, Kichi receiving Kaiba's memories after Vanilla's memory transfer was contrived, as the series didn't provide a good enough reason why that location was chosen. Furthermore, although Popo's motivations and hypocrisy in disobeying the rules of Issoudan were understandable, several of his decisions were questionable: from  not disposing of Kaiba when he and Neiro fell from the castle to his attempts at getting Kaiba and Neiro to go against each other, rather than ridding Kaiba himself. Popo's ideals of instrumentality (of unifying everyone into a single existence) before being betrayed seemed to come out of nowhere without enough a sufficient basis. Even worse was the barrage of betrayals that occurred in episode 11, which also raised the question of how Mantle and the fake warp survived up to that point, as that wasn't explained well enough. Kichi's love for Hyohyo and Sate's desire to follow Popo faithfully until the latter's instrumentality plan needed to be contextualized better.  Fortunately, the ending at the very least handled the relationship between Kaiba and Neiro well, suggesting the importance of connection beyond class divide. Their interactions in both the light-hearted and serious moments were well done, and Neiro was integral in Kaiba's growth from a tyrant focused solely on executing others. Neiro's motivating of Kaiba and her influence as his driving force were necessary for Kaiba's ability to resolve the conflict with the kaiba plant and establish a conclusion in which the connections between individuals was stronger. Despite this, the presence of the kaiba plant at the end seemed far too rushed, and the appearance of another warp at the end wasn't explained properly. The role of the revolving fans also weren't as prominent as they could have been, merely thrown in at the end and taken care of immediately. \\n\\n\r\nKaiba also had one partciualar lacking character arc. Primarily, Vanilla lacked enough characterization for his sacrifice to have weight  as he was portrayed almost solely through physical attraction to Chroniko. Thankfully, such physical impulse is consistent with Kaiba's theme pertaining to the value of the body, but Vanilla being portrayed almost primarily by this hindered the investment that his sacrifice required. Perhaps if his character traits such as his desire to bring back his mother were established earlier on and further traits were added  to present him as a more fleshed out character, his fate would have had more impact. \\n\\n\r\nFrom this we can see a handful of issues with Kaiba's execution. Nonetheless, its ambition mostly made up for it. How it presented its world visually was impressive, and although it had issues with its story, it performed a commendable job given how ambitious it was for the run-time. It would also be an injustice to not mention how strong the series was audio-visually. Kaiba's art was vibrant and distinct compared to most anime, and it featured a strong soundtrack for both the more light-hearted and the more melancholic moments. The character designs were simple yet still expressive, varied, and effective. The series even made use of shortcomings in its art/animation as the lower budget episode 5 integrated the drop in art quality into its story of consumerism and the desire for the artificial. Kaiba definitely uses its audiovisuals for full capacity and probably couldn't work as well in any other storytelling medium.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: (Personal Rating\u2014Fairly Good)\\n\\n\r\nIt's no surprise Kaiba is one of the quintessential artsy anime in the medium. It's highly experimental and ambitious in its approach, and although it does falter in the execution of its story, what it accomplishes is more than enough for it to be a worthwhile series. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Short version:\r\nStory (9/10) - Wonderful setting and good world building, intricate plot and strong mystery factor. First few episodes can be off-putting.\r\nCharacters (7/10) - Bland main character, very strong supporting cast.\r\nAnimation and Art (7/10) - Good use of a unique bubbly artstyle, inconsistent backgrounds.\r\nSoundtracks (9/10) - Beautiful BGM that amplifies every scene's emotions, good vocals.\r\nEnjoyment (8/10) - First 2 episodes were full of confusion, but everything starts to clear up and the story becomes engaging. \r\nOverall (8/10) - A story with a strong message that uses a unique style of presentation in a good way.\r\nLong version:\r\nMemories are one of the few things in our worldthat are invaluable. Rich or poor, strong or weak, we all have memories exclusive to us. It is these memories that make us who we are and molds our persona. Without our memories, we are nothing but a shell of our genuine self. Kaiba is set in a world where memories are given physical form. They are bought, sold, stolen or even eaten like food. It tells a story of love in a cruel dystopia and it does it superbly.\\n\\n\r\nThe story starts off rather confusing. We are shown, Kaiba, our main character waking up in the middle in of a ravaged village with no recollection of his memories. The first episode leaves you with a huge amount of questions which acts as a great hook as it would pique your interest with a strong mystery factor. However this can also be a double edged sword as people who are looking for straight forward narratives can be put off with the huge confusion. By the end, most of these questions are answered either by ambiguous or clear ways. The first half of the anime consists mainly of episodic stories of different characters Kaiba meets across space. These episodes do a sublime job of showcasing the diabolical setting through the tragic tales of different people across the universe that emotionally immerse the viewer. The second half of the anime addresses the main narrative which revolves around Kaiba's lost memories. This half is filled with unexpected plot twists, intense conflicts and endearing romance.\\n\\n\r\nSince he has no memories, the main character doesn't have much of a personality at the start. He is usually listening to other characters talking to him for the majority of the time. He doesn't show anything that makes him distinct or enable you to relate to him which makes him dull for the most part. Although that can be excused as a plot factor, it still makes it harder for the viewer to relate to Kaiba. This becomes less of a problem later on because Kaiba undergoes some development in the second half as he regains his memories but he stills remains slightly dull without much of a personality, acting mostly as a plot device. The supporting characters is rich and most of the characters are memorable. Some characters experience substantial development over the course of merely 3 episodes while others leave a strong emotional impact on you in just one. Since memories are given physical forms. the show easily portrays the characters' feelings and emotions in enthralling ways. The female heroine experiences internal conflict that is well presented and the motives of some of the characters are made believable due to the conditions of their upbringing.\\n\\n\r\nThe most distinct feature of Kaiba is its cartoonish art-style which gives characters an innocent look that acts as a profound contrast to the cruel world they live in. Despite the characters being well drawn with attention to detail, the backgrounds suffered from large inconsistencies to the point where it was difficult to tell what was being shown. The animation was smooth for the most part and suffered from insignificant faults. The beauty and fluidity were most noticeable during action scenes in the last few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nKaiba's soundtrack is one of the best I heard. Not only is it mesmerizing on its own, but each track played was depicting the scene being shown. It made the sad scenes tragic, the happy scenes joyful and the tense scenes intense. The overall tone of the show is sad and naturally the same goes for the soundtrack. Some of the OST uses vocals that provide more emotional depth and meaning to the music. I wasn't very impressed by the OP and ED during my first listen; but as I watched more of the anime and comprehended the messages of the narrative, I took meaning to the lyrics of these songs and they grew on me.\\n\\n\r\nEven though the first 2 episodes didn't pull me in, the rest of the anime was a marvelous journey. The episodic stories during the first half are indelible pieces of suffering. Only to be followed by a roller coaster of revelations and plot twists that kept me on the edge of my seat.\\n\\n\r\nKaiba is great. The concept of memories is used in many narratives but rarely does it succeed like it did in Kaiba. In 12 episodes, it managed to tell an emotionally impactful story about love and memories in an unfair world. It was an innovative experience that won't be forgotten. It is a great addition to my memories. It is a great addition to me. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThank you for taking the time to read.",

            "content": "Kaiba is an experimental anime best known as being the brainchild of Yuasa Masaaki, who would later go on to direct The Tatami Galaxy and Ping Pong the Animation, two of the greatest works of the current decade of anime thus far. And Kaiba is undeniably in the same vein of brilliance as his later works. However, as impressive as Kaiba is, it's not as good as Tatami or Ping Pong - which is regrettable, because by all accounts it should have been just as exceptional as these two - if not better.\r\nI mean, it was certainly more amibitious than either of them, and thosetwo were plenty ambitious as it is. Where Tatami and Ping Pong were both highly eccentric coming-of-age stories, Kaiba is a highly eccentric dystopian high-concept sci-fi, revolving around the concept of a fictional universe in which memories are tangible, modifiable, and transferrable.\\n\\n\r\nThe first thing you'll notice about Kaiba is that it is visually stunning. This extends far past the surrealistically cutesy character designs and bizarre environments - the animation is tremendously fluid, the visual design is a thing of awe, and the impressive and elaborate set-pieces are a great example of Masaaki's incredible talent as a director.\\n\\n\r\nThe design isn't just a shallow aesthetic choice, either. The cutesy designs are a stark contrast to the dystopian setting, making the graphic nature of this series far more unsettling than it would have been given a more conventional presentation. The music is similar, in that it is a mix of creepiness and childlike innocence. The bizarre technology is a great part of Kaiba's aesthetic as well, with the vehicles, weaponry, and memory technology bearing a creative design that comes off as both high-conccept and cutesy at once.\\n\\n\r\nThe early episodes are the series' strongest, each of them an episodic vignette about the planet the episode is set on. These build excellent short stories that not only make for great worldbuilding, fleshing out a well-realized setting in which human lives are cheap and where memories are a commodity, but also create the kind of ethereal, atmospheric dreamscapes out of the setting that you can really lose yourself in.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem with Kaiba arises when it becomes plot-driven in the latter half. While the core of it - a central character conflict between our three leads, Kaiba, Neiro, and Poppo - is very strong, it gets lost in a larger entanglement of numerous subplots revolving around minor characters that become impressively convoluted in a short span of time. There are an absurd number of twists regarding the identities and goals of characters before the plot even has time to make us invested in them. The viewer never has a chance to be grounded in what they are supposed to believe - it's hard to be surprised by a twist about a character you never knew from the start, and harder yet to understand why any character does what they do when their supposed motives and alliegiances will shift at the drop of a hat.\\n\\n\r\nBut for a series with such a poorly-executed plot (and do keep in mind, this would be the death of almost any lesser series), Kaiba remains a remarkably impressive piece of work. The concept is brilliantly utilized, the setting is both engaging and entrancing, and the presentation is damn near peerless - perhaps rivalled only by Masaaki's later work. There's also some surprisingly strong characterisation in play here... not for the titular character, though, who is mostly a blank slate (which, to be fair, is used to great effect in the early episodes), but for Poppo, who is perhaps the only good example of a shift in motives in this series (and there are many). To elaborate too much on this would be to ruin it, but I will say that there's a certain scene in his backstory that evolves as the plot progresses, and this is combined with certain plot devices in a clever way that shows Masaaki's directing as nothing short of masterful.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Words: Kaiba really is a unique, impressive series, and I'd highly recommend it. But it is frustrating that it didn't live up to its full potential - perhaps if it were longer, it would have been able to fully flesh out its plot.\\n\\n\r\nStory/Plot: 4/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\r\nAnimation/Art: 10/10\\n\r\nMusic: 10/10\\n\r\nActing: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nFor Fans Of: Angel's Egg, The Tatami Galaxy",

            "content": "One of the most distressing things about some anime is their inability to use to its fullest potential many of the interesting ideas that they come up with. Some get bogged down in trying to appeal to as many people as possible or by just abandoning originality in favour of playing it safe by ripping off other successful shows and characters. But with Kaiba its a little different,  the show had some interesting original ideas, art and characters and was definitely not try to appeal to a mainstream audience but it too failed to reach its full potential and become some thing truly greatbut it was for a number of different reasons than what happens to most other anime, but I'll get into that later... \\n\\n\r\nThe basic premise of Kaiba is the story of a young boy who wakes up possessing no memories, and his only possession is a locket with a picture of a girl, and a hole in his chest. He then goes on a journey throughout the highly sensationalised and Dr Seuss style world of this anime while diving into a complex look at human nature, class warfare and the dangers of technology.\\n\\n\r\nNow to start off I would like to say that one of the reasons I enjoyed Kaiba was because it was not afraid to take risks, so many anime these days are terrified to do anything different with their art or story that we end up with generic rip off's and so many anime`s set in schools and rom-coms that its gotten ridiculous . While not revolutionary this anime did take some big risks at a time when studio companies are only concerned with one word \u201cmoe\u201d and for that I was very grateful and pleased to see that originality still exists.\\n\\n\r\nThe story in Kaiba while interesting, is probably its biggest flaw, not because it\u2019s a bad story, not at all, in fact some of the ideas are very interesting to watch and think about. such as the idea of memory chips which can store people memory's and allow the switching of bodies, this has led to a way to cheat death and allow people (who can afford it) to get their dream bodies. But as with anything new and revolutionary it has its dark side, with people being forced to sell their bodies (literally) for money and even body stealing and collecting. Really at its core that\u2019s what this anime is really about, showing us the dark side of human nature and the horrible things we\u2019re capable of. But this is where the problems come in, while kaiba has some interesting ideas their not developed enough for us to become enthralled with them and most importantly they are not explained enough, so let me explain...\\n\\n\r\nNow id like to think of myself as someone with at least average intelligence and I don't need every little thing explained to me, in fact it can be more interesting when you have to use your imagination to fill in the blanks, but for fucks sake nothing was explained or made any sense in this anime. To be truthful it felt like the makers said \u201cokay lets create a really trippy world that will show people the evils of human nature and will make them think while tugging at their emotions\u201d and they did this really well, but then tacked on a half backed plot with some under developed characters at the end without much thought or real effort, the truth is this story and characters felt rushed and not thought out probably because it was rushed and not thought out. Had Kaiba been just an exploration of the world, rather than focusing so much on the plot in the second half then this series could have been a real gem to watch. Its possible to create an anime that just focuses on the spectacle rather than the characters or story and when you do something like that then its okay if a lot of things are left unexplained because we are just along for the ride but when you try to tell a complicated story and give characters some real depth then you have to at least get the basics straight other wise we cant get invested or relate to the characters because nothing makes sense. This is the main reason Kaiba failed to acheive its full potential, because time has taught us again and again that no amount of visuals, special effects or cool characters can replace a good, intersting, logical story ( take the hint Micheal Bay!) and without this everything is just wasted because a story brings together all the other elements. \"A special effect is just a tool, a means of telling a story, a special effect without a story is a pretty boring thing.\"-George Lucas. (before he became a sell out.) \\n\\n\r\nAnyway enough with the story the next thing to mention is the art. To say how good the art is feels a bit like flogging a dead horse at this point but to sum up what everyone has said is that its fantastic, very sensationalised and defiantly the strongest point of this show. But to say one thing that not many people mention is how the art is very clearly influenced by other materials from western animation and older shows rather than just coping the contemporary anime art styles, this was a nice touch and help give the show a fell of originality. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound in Kaiba is perfect for what the show is trying to do, for the most part its subdued and kept in the background allowing us to feel what's happening without being to much in your face and manipulating. It not particlarly memorable but it certainly better than average and like the art seems to draw on a larger field of influence than most other animes. One thing that I noticed was that the music seemed to be very similar too or at least influenced by an old game called the Neverhood which I noticed a lot of this series seems to have drawn influence from. \\n\\n\r\nTo conclude I would say that Kaiba is a perfect example of wasted potential and another chapter in the \u201cwhat could have been great\u201d book that the anime industry is currently writing. But even so I cant stress enough that this review is not a negative one, I just wanted to point out some of the problems to allow people to understand why a good series like this fails to achieve the level of greatness that it could have. Overall this series is a very good and interesting one that sucks you in and never lets go and you certainly wont forget about it for a very long time. While it didn't reach the heights it could have, Kaiba is still a welcome relief from the usual direction anime has been heading in for the past few years and is a must see for anyone looking for something a little different.",

            "content": "What is a human being? It's a collaboration of memories. Memories of yourself and memories of how others see you. When you destroy or change either of the aspects - the whole being changes.\r\nKaiba is a story about memories, about memories that were lost, memories that were changed. About how good and bad memories are of equal importance.\r\nHumans strive to find a way to forget. Forget all the bad memories and leave the goods ones. But if we forget, doesn't it makes us less of what we are? Without bad experience we wouldn't be the same person.\r\nThe world of Kaiba is one of dystopia. Thepoverty strikes harshly against the wealthiness. In this world the memories can be moved around. Deleted, copied, sold and bought. As well as bodies that lost all their memories. The rich ones may live forever by storing their memories in an expensive chip and moving it between bodies, while the poor ones either sell their memories or bodies for a hope of better tomorrow.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is... strange, to say the least. It's a minimalistic caricature in every aspects, from the character design to the world. It took me six episodes to finally get a grip on it and understand small aspects.\\n\r\nThe sound is great, the melodies are lovely and they kick in just in the right time to get you pumped or to crush your heart.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has no mercy. On several occasions it crushed my souls with how ruthless it is. There's no forgiveness. It took me by my heart and didn't let go until the last credits passed.\\n\\n\r\nIt's one of the six titles out of almost three hundred watched that received a score of 10 from me. I always try very hard to evaluate the experience I gained with each title and the very last condition after getting a 9 is to have an ending that I liked. This one managed it, to my happiness.",

            "content": "Ah, first review, here we come! (There might be a few spoilers)\r\nKaiba is not your typical anime. From the unorthodox way of animation, to the strange, confusing (but brilliant) storyline, it breaks the mold for anime you'd probably typically watch. There are virtually no characters that fall into the groups of typical anime stereotypes (yandere, tsundere) and the anime introduces interesting sci-fi concepts that we probably could never imagine ourselves, which brings out the amazing originality of this piece of art (I mean anime).\r\nKaiba's basic storyline starts off in a world where memories can be manipulated and swapped and bodies can be interchangeable, meaning youcan freely delete bad memories and replace them with good ones, and implant them into another body. We find the main protagonist (Kaiba) inside a crumbling white room, with no memory of who he is or why he is there. Before he can ask any of these questions, he finds himself being chased by what seemed to be an over sized hairdryer. After narrowly escaping it, he embarks on the journey to regain his memories, traveling from many planets and meeting many people along the way.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\r\nThe story was brilliantly laid out. From the beginning to the end, it Kaiba kept me hooked to my computer screen. The paciing was to the point of near perfection, letting us sympathize with Kaiba, while letting us view and immerse ourselves in his futuristic world. Bits of the plot are leaked out slowly, making you wonder what is happening and why, driving you to finish the series. Eventually though, all these pieces of the plot you'll find can interconnect, and the true brilliance of\\n\r\nthe story is revealed.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nIt's like something out of a Salvador Dalli painting. The background environment is amazing and complex, with very interesting depictions of strange animals and fiery suns. Nearly everything is coloured for its situation, with poor places painted very dully and plain, whereas aquatic theme parks are bright with many hues of blue and yellow. The characters design, though different from what I'd regularly see out of an anime, was still pleasing to the eye, as the characters seemed to be drawn more circularly. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe OP and ED were very memorable (if not engrishy). Most of the background music enhanced the environment, and basically emulated the senses. Overall, the sound was very well done.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\nThis is probably the best part of this anime. All the characters have diverse personalities and goals, which gives each of them a strong sense of individuality.\\n\r\nSometimes, you'll have some misconceptions of some characters, take Popo. You first find him aiding Kaiba to the spaceship, giving him the sense that he is an ally. Then we find he is a member of the Issoudan, a group to kill the king of memories (really Kaiba, but Warp occupies the throne). Here we find he has traits of an arrogant and bloodthirsty antagonist, with no mercy to Kaiba/Warp or anyone who betrays the Issoudan. We only find in the  latter episodes his real intention in to find a body for the memories of his mother,  giving him sympathy and reasoning for his actions., putting him back in to his neutral stance, and renewing some sympathy for him.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it was an awesome ride. and I recommend you watch it. Now.\\n",

            "content": "Don't let the art style fool you... this is not a child's show.  Actually it is a rather depressing and bleak look at human nature and mortality or at least it has been early on.  The watcher gets the sense that at any moment the tide could change and there will be light around the next bend.  The story is very unique and will rank high among most anime if people can go past the artwork to try the show out and if the story does not take a downward spiral from here.  Anyway, if you are wondering whether you shouldtry out this anime, seriously give it a shot and watch the first episode you will be intrigued.  But let me give this warning: if you don't like being semi-depressed; avoid it.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is really not that bad in an artistic sense.  Actually, one could make the argument that this show could not work without this specific cartoon feel.  But one could also say that it is rather simplistic and bland.  So I gave it a 6.  I may revise that later.  Actually sense this is an early review; I will likely revise the whole thing later.",

            "content": "Kaiba is a story that begins with a young boy who possesses no memories, a locket with a blurry picture of a girl, and a hole in his chest.  From there on, it dives into a complex look at what it means to live, speaking to its audience in eclectic ambient music, flat hues, simplified textures, and caricatured expressions.  \r\nIt is a story of heartache, rejection, and despair.  It is a story of loss and of pain, and one that explores a world in which there is incalculable capacity for wrongdoing, cruelty, and evil.  It is a story that hits itsaudience with difficult and complex moral problems, yet it offers very little in the way of solace or resolution for any of the questions it raises.  It pulls no punches and promises no answers, and in doing so, retains a sense of honesty with its audience that few works of its nature posses.\\n\\n\r\nAnd yet, in spite of the horrors and sadness that the world of Kaiba is embroiled in and consumed with, the core cast of characters are simply ones who\u2014similar to each and every one of the characters they meet on their journey\u2014are struggling with the questions of how to be, and what it is that constitutes being.  In a world where memories and forms are stolen, bartered, and sacrificed as easily as clothing or food, identity becomes even more fluid and fragile than it is in real life.  Kaiba takes this theme and extrapolates it into a reality so twisted and surreal that its commentary is impossible to miss.\\n\\n\r\nCinematically, Yuasa offers a unique directorial method of presentation that draws far more from Osamu Tezuka\u2019s gekiga than from the prevailing influences of today\u2019s directors.  Yuasa\u2019s adaption of Tezuka\u2019s style goes beyond the obvious character model similarities (designed by Nobutaka Ito), infiltrating every nook and cranny of the narrative elements.  A reverence for and homage to Tezuka\u2019s method is present from settings and thematic scope down into the minutiae of presentation, particularly in shot compositions and depictions of action or psychoses that alternates between reserved detachment and unforgettable heart-pounding relevance.  The surrealistic, futuristic depiction of the thematic emphasis on the relationship and nature of individuality, consciousness, memories, and flesh could be right at home in something like \u201cApollo\u2019s Song\u201d.  The portrayals of intolerable human cruelty resultant from complex, struggling characters seem to spring right out of something like \u201cOde to Kirihito\u201d.  The heavy handed assault of dense symbols and exaggerated physical forms screams for a sense of old-school melodrama that much modern anime generally lacks\u2014or often enough, when it IS present, it is rarely ever handled with the level of versatility and adroitness that Yuasa presents in Kaiba.\\n\\n\r\nBut this is not to say that Yuasa is somehow \u201cripping off\u201d Tezuka\u2019s legendary works in any way\u2014in fact, one need not even be the least bit familiar with Tezuka\u2019s body of work in order to enjoy this program.  What maintains Kaiba\u2019s uniqueness is that, both in spite of and because of its use of Tezuka-esque elements, it ultimately offers an experience that is greater than the mere sum of its parts.  The skill with which Yuasa manipulates his characters and paces his episodes bridges the gap between the work and the audience in a way few anime series achieve; although the first episode resembles more a dream than a traditional narrative, it doesn\u2019t take long for emotional attachment to form around both the primary characters of the show (as they are sparingly revealed) and the secondary characters that pop up per episode and often disappear just as suddenly.  Much of the program retains a quality akin to something of a vague hallucination even after completion, however its narrative remains traditional enough that things like characters, plot, back story, and development are all recognizable.\\n\\n\r\nWhat begins as a fever dream or a nightmare turns out to be a cerebral quest through amnesia, psychosis, revelation, doubt, and finally trust.  Some of its mysteries are slowly unraveled explicitly, others are left to subtle allusions or drift wantonly in a haze of ambiguity.  Development of the characters involved with the story of the protagonist alternates between exceptionally subtle and heavy-handed, though often times both \u2018subtlety\u2019 and \u2018heavy-handed\u2019 development occur simultaneously.  It is most likely its themes and tone\u2014outside of the visuals, of course\u2014that will leave the heaviest mark upon its audience; Yuasa\u2019s skill at sculpting atmosphere through imagery and sound is truly worthy of recognition.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, Kaiba is not an easy series to watch.  It is one that will present to its audience powerful images with powerful connotations that are not easily shaken off by the invested viewer.  Its characters are memorable and complex.  Its visuals, no doubt the most obvious thing to distinguish it from its peers, may give false first impressions or lend to it unjustified labels of pretentiousness.  In the end, it is a work that is extremely difficult to describe in full, and one that is likely to affect each of its viewers in radically different ways.\\n\\n\r\nRecommended for fans of abstract cinema, surrealism, science fiction, Osamu Tezuka, other Yuasa works, or simply anyone looking for a short cerebral series that is nigh indescribable.",

It's because they can't be happy unless they have people below them. This show creates a whole universe around this concept and other unconventional ideals. From the anime description and genre choices for this show, and even the database picture the normalanime viewer might be a little turned off from this show. At first glance for me I quickly turned it away as I thought it was aimed toward children. Despite showing an R+ rating I also notice ratings are usually 20% correct in the MAL database. \\n\\n\r\nBut after pushing it aside for about two weeks, I finally decided to give it a shot and boy will you be surprised. Right off the start, you're heart will start racing as you follow the story of the main character. A after waking up from a daze, blade runner 'esque chase quickly follows. After the action, the main character appears to be very lost, which I'm sure most of you will feel the same way he does. This also starts a unique connection and experience between the viewer and the main character. This is where the show really starts. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing I'm sure most people will notice is the art style. You will either love it or hate it but don't let the artwork turn you away from this show. After an episode or two you will most likely appreciate the level of originality this art style brings to the plate. After i have seen over 100+ series in a three month span, this was a very welcome change to the orthodox anime styles. Dont let the simple look fool you as well, there are more than enough small details to pay attention to throughout. From the tiny memory pellets to an overcrowded storage room. Everything looks very thought out and amazing. Often you'll probably think to yourself, how the hell does Misaaki and Nobutaka make this ***t up?\\n\\n\r\nAnother false assumption was that the characters were mostly children since they have a simple child like look to them. But they are very much mature adults. The characters are are all so very likable and I owe a lot of that to the art style and the small details that they do or don't leave out. The even greater point is how Masaaki Yuasa goes to great depths to control the viewers emotions with the use of these characters. One minute, you'll hate a character, then the next you'll feel sorry for them, then you'll feel frustrated because this is almost an emotional roller coaster. Rest assured, this is a good kind of frustration (if there is such a thing). \\n\\n\r\nDefintiely &quot;don't judge this book by its cover.&quot; This point of view story was rather an interesting one and the science, technology, and hierarchy surrounding this universe was very captivating experience. There are quite a large number of allusions and ideals in every episode that got me reflecting on what I have just experienced (which I absolutely love).  I can't really compare this to any other anime show. If i had to compare the story to something, it like a telling of a blade runner/ matrix story in the eyes of Dr. Seuss. \\n\\n\r\nA great way to close this epic show would be a quote from Dr. Seuss' Yertle the Turtle:\\n\r\n&quot;You hush your mouth!&quot; Howled the Mighty King Yertle.\\n\r\n&quot;You have no right to talk to the world's highest turtle.\\n\r\n&quot;I rule from the clouds, over land, over sea!\\n\r\nThere is no nothing, NOTHING, that's higher than me!&quot;",

            "content": "Kaiba is a dystopian/cyberpunk anime. The atypical story telling and mesmerizing dystopias which are always complemented with vivid and unique artwork of the highest degree make for a highly enjoyable experience for myself. By no means do I consider these to be  flawless genres but the amalgamation of the many tropes from these genres creates a captivating experience I personally can\u2019t really find in other genre(s), so on that fact this review may be a little bias. One could argue that Kaiba itself is not a cyberpunk series but a dystopian fantasy and I could agree with that, and maybe that is why Iconsider it a cut above the rest of the cyberpunk (GitS and Texhnolyze  for instance) I've watched. It is something fresh and has a totally different approach and perspective. However I do still feel it does share many similarities that cyberpunk does, so I will still refer to it as such.\\n\\n\r\nLike any other cyberpunk and dystopian anime it is apparent from the inception that it is a society that has been totally dehumanized. In this case, to handheld chips and yellow blobs. Bodies are thrown away like old clothing and replaced on mere whims. Human life and emotion is \"seemingly\" disregarded. Which is generally the most common criticism, and maybe even point, of these genres. They lack any real empathy and it is understandable that this can deter viewers from the genre. However, this is where Kaiba truly shines. Kaiba puts the futuristic technology into a more human context and is the reason why I emphasize the word seemingly. It is an empathetic cyberpunk, that is to say, that characters express true emotions and warmth. Which is something these series generally lack (for better or for worse? that\u2019s each person's decision). It shows this empathy whilst at the same time, it is able to show the total loss of human value. To be able to show both polar opposites of this spectrum without one impacting the other is a true testament to how well done this series is.\\n\\n\r\nThe empathy is shown in many cases throughout the series, such as maternal bonds, but most notably through the two main characters that, despite not remembering each other, and being in totally different bodies, they are still drawn together and attracted to one another. It also shows the sacrifices one is willing to take to stay with their loved ones and no amount of deceit and lies will stand between characters coming together. And at heart, this really is a series about human longing and romance.\\n\\n\r\nSimilarly, the OST completely compliments and helps illustrate both the dystopian nature of the world in which Kaiba is set and also its warm empathetic side. Most notably two pieces: the  Melody of Clonico and The Tree Song. The Melody of Clonico (episode 3) really serves to illustrate the empathetic side of the series. The Tree Song holds magnificent symbolism in both a literal and metaphorical sense, and it is no surprise why this song is teased throughout the entire series becoming its \u2018staple\u2019 piece. While this may not be relevant to some, it is something I can wholeheartedly appreciate. This song illustrates the entire series as a whole in more than one way.\\n\\n\r\nKaiba's characters are fantastic for the most part. A large portion of the series can be considered episodic, meaning, Kaiba travels from one place to another and in doing so meets characters along the way that don't stay relevant for very long but they do what's required of them and are well developed enough in most cases that you genuinely care about them and what happens to them. Kaiba is a very interesting and mysterious character that at the beginning, the viewer knows as much (or as little) as Kaiba himself, who has lost his memories. As the series progresses Kaiba - and the viewer - learn more about his past which made it a very engaging experience as he slowly becomes more aware of the girl in his locket. That girl being Neiro. Neiro is also a very interesting character, who, without spoiling much, has issues of her own in regards to her memories. The most rewarding thing about the characters, namely Kaiba - but also others - is that his genuine interactions with other characters within the series brings a sense of warmth to an otherwise, overly cold and dark society.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is a love or hate relationship. It is far from mainstream and maybe even pretentious. There's not much to say about that, the animation is still fluid, the characters are still well designed and the world they find themselves in is equally well designed. I personally found it to be one of the series greatest strengths and made it an even more rewarding watch.\\n\\n\r\nKaiba is a bag of mixed emotions, on one hand it is incredibly sad to watch as human life is literally thrown away and treated like garbage, but on the other hand it is beautifully warm to see individuals stop at nothing to preserve this life and connect with their loved ones. It left me not knowing what to feel at times and I can only say that as absolute praise for the series. I am not saying this series is for everyone, it is totally understandable that if you\u2019re not a fan of cyberpunk/dystopian anime this may not be for you, but if you don\u2019t like these genres for the lack of empathy they portray, this may pleasantly surprise you. There are other reasons why this isn't for everyone, most notably, its art which as I said, is far from the mainstream. It may not be an easy watch for some, especially given the cyberpunk/dystopian tropes it has, but it is something I loved wholeheartedly.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for taking the time to read.\\n",

            "content": "Where there is a body, there is a mind. A mind that is unquestionably a part of us and remains to be this way until our eventual passing. Throughout the centuries of philosophy and science, it is one of the most utterly fascinating aspects of human existence that has yet to be explored fully. There have been many stories that have delved into the realm of consciousness as the primary plot device from the mid-20th-century science fiction authors, and anime has had its fair share of shows that are akin to this. One of which is Kaiba, a fascinating trip that shows no boundaries ofanimation and how it can use different styles in anime that have primarily been redundant at the time.\\n\\n\r\nIt is true that this type of story has not been done before. One that deals with the concept of minds and how it's our self, but with Kaiba, it's like a journey you go through with our main hero, named Kaiba. He meets different characters from his trip that all have distinct characteristics that make them stick out from the rest, who may or may not help him in his search to find his memories that have been lost after his long slumber. As we follow our likable hero, we discover how the world that Kaiba inhabits has begun to crumble under its dystopia. Although they portray the setting in a surrealist manner to give it a distinctive look, there's still the lack of any depth to the world itself. In other words, there's not enough to go around from the lack of exposition it gives to the history of this world that Kaiba has to offer, and it only succeeds halfheartedly.\\n\\n\r\nWith that said, even though the plot features some mind-bending, philosophical facets that incorporate Kaiba, the story-telling that helps guide them through the narrative is somewhat lacking. Nonetheless, when the show starts, it manages to make an excellent first impression in showing us first-hand what the world is like and how the other people who live in it go through the absolute turmoil that plagues their way of life. Some moments were even strong enough to invoke tears from my eyes. However, it doesn't take long until we cut away from the protagonist and then start going into the character back story of another named Chroniko. To explain this clearly, Kaiba implants his memories into Chroniko, and from then on we get to explore Chroniko's past and how she was brought up into the world. While this might seem admirable to make us know that there are, in fact, more than just Kaiba that might matter, I feel as though it wasn't even needed in the first place when we already have to follow Kaiba and his journey to get his memories back, even though technically he's inside of Chroniko in these scenes.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, we follow other characters such as the sheriff, named Vanilla, and his fascination with Chroniko, or in this case, the body that Kaiba inhabits. This plays off more like a desperate attempt to make the show longer. After that, we discourage entirely that whole moment that involved both of those characters, and we follow Kaiba like nothing ever happened previously. One could say that those plot arcs were necessary for Kaiba to understand the meaning of human emotion and the human condition, but it comes across as a bit trite and forgettable once the next episode rolls in.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough with that said, the conclusion to the story felt incredibly fulfilling to experience after a brilliant romantic setup between Kaiba and Neiro, who play off each other very well. Their immediate feelings for each other might seem a little cliched, but how they direct the dialogue they say to each other comes off rather fluently and feels genuine. Right near the very last frame of the previous episode, it felt like the best way to give Kaiba a sense of closure.\\n\\n\r\nBy far the most alluring aspect of Kaiba that has made it somewhat of an indistinguishable show amongst the anime community is the art and animation. Directed by Masaaki Yuasa, who also directed the classic The Tatami Galaxy and directed the animation and wrote the surrealist film Cat Soup, this man knows his way of transforming his visions into reality and making us clamor for more of his artistic creativity. Kaiba's hook from its animation relies not just on an unconventional art style, but also its seamless implementation to the story and tone it tries to convey to us. Once we see the art style which Yuasa executes on constructing Kaiba's world, the result is no less than jaw-dropping. In some areas, it might seem even a little forceful in the attempts of making things a little too wacky and cartoony, the moments where it shows how people can invade someone's memories look incredible at face value.\\n\\n\r\nThe fluid motions that the characters exhibit in the show's animation feel reminiscent of western-influence and the works of the great Osamu Tezuka. The abstract shapes of the buildings and vehicles give the show its unique identity and ultimately becomes very memorable in that aspect. There is about as much creativity as one could get from a studio named Madhouse, who's no stranger to producing shows similar in nature of Kaiba.\\n\\n\r\nOn the overall quality of the sound production, the voice acting is serviceable with the veteran voice actresses Romi Park and Mamiko Noto giving out terrific performances. Even with the limited amount of dialogue that the character Kaiba has throughout the story, Houko Kuwashima plays out the amnesiac archetype rather convincingly. Her voice emotes perfectly as an unemotional character who has lost all sense of meaning in his life because of how memories play a huge role to him and how that was perpetually lost. One thing to note in music is the opening song for Kaiba which is composed quite beautifully from the sublime electronic ambiance mixed with subtle orchestration. On top of that is the beautiful voice of Seira Kagami, giving a dazzling performance that sets a tone of pure melancholic loneliness, one of the main themes of the entirety of Kaiba.\\n\\n\r\nThere's nothing quite like Kaiba's style and finesse to be found in most anime shows. I say style as in the animation, which is the only significant aspect of the show that makes it worth watching, but that's not to say that the story is terrible by any means. There's more to be seen in Kaiba than just the art and animation; but if it was only focused a little more tightly and given more world-building for it to be memorable, this would've been ranked higher. There is no doubt people will be looking at the art style and start thinking it's nothing like anime they're used to and reject it immediately. Distinctive qualities are a rarity these days, and I'm perfectly fine with this. No doubt we need more creative measures put into the medium, but when one show comes out in that one particular season that puts a lot of effort into its aesthetic qualities that challenge the norm, then that makes that one show all the more special.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: B+\\n",

            "content": "Art - 10\r\nKaiba is visually stunning and creative.  Sometimes they trade in dynamic quality of images for free animation, and it&rsquo;s not a bad thing.  The art design is very Seussian, especially in architecture.  There is a wonderful roundness to everything, with nary a straight line in sight.  Despite the character design, there is an unexpected expressiveness in the facial animation.  There is a thoughtfulness in each character&rsquo;s appearance that is underscored by the fact that characters don&rsquo;t look anything alike unless they are twins.  The direction utilizes light and shadow brilliantly to keep the eye focused on theimportant, active pieces.  Computer animation is good, and well integrated into the show, allowing a freedom of movement in both character and cameras that many should take note.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9\\n\r\nI don&rsquo;t want to say perfect, but the music was so well done that I really can&rsquo;t say enough about it.  The ending and beginning themes really help to create this other-worldly, exploratory feeling that the viewer has while watching the show.  The most amazing part of the sound track, though is &ldquo;The Tree Song.&rdquo;  It&rsquo;s a masterpiece.  There are three versions of the song used throughout the show and it is always implemented beautifully.  It&rsquo;s varied enough that it gives meaning to many different scenes, and distinctive enough that you remember the song as a whole.  Voice acting is good on the whole.  I don&rsquo;t think there was anytime that I question choices in the acting, but no one really left an impression besides Vanilla&rsquo;s voice actor.  The voice actor for Popo also does a good job, giving a certain amount of depth and quality to such a badly handled character.  Some of the foley was very funny and charming.  Much of the sounds of spaceships flying, guns firing, and hitting target were quirky and added character to the world\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 6\\n\r\nThe characters are just ok.  Unfortunately the viewer learns so much toward the end that it becomes very overwhelming to feel like you actually know and understand each of characters and their thought processes.  Popo was interesting in the beginning, but once his motives are revealed, he is abrasively two dimensional and overexaggerated. Kaiba is quite empty.  Part of this is necessary because of the role he plays in the beginning of the show, but after a while, it becomes clear that there is no real depth to anything that he does.  While he is in Chroniko&rsquo;s body he is astonishingly unconcerned with Vanilla&rsquo;s feelings, and kind of mindlessly strings him along without a second thought.  Vanilla, though, is easily the best character in the show.  He is clearly conceived, and believably makes all of his decisions, no matter how vile or dumb the viewer may find them.  Kichi isn&rsquo;t a bad character, but again becomes important so late in the series that it&rsquo;s a shame a lot of time was wasted on other, less important, subjects.  Neiro just flat out wasn&rsquo;t competently executed, bland, and a slave to the plot 90% of the time.  The only thing notable with her was an encounter she had with Chroniko-Kaiba while she was in the body of another man.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 5\\n\r\nHad Kaiba been just a visual exploration of the world, rather than tethering itself down to an overall plot, then I think the creators would have had a better time with the story.  It&rsquo;s very clear that the show was bound by the main plot in the last half of the show.  Kaiba is centered around the title character who has amnesia, the only notable thing is that he has is a hole in his chest and a locket of a girl. This story starts as an simple idea, then leaves that thought to explore worlds in a variety of vignettes, then coming back to the main plot cashing and burning in convolution.  Characters who play an important role in the show are completely eschewed at the beginning, and are haplessly stuffed into the end leaving no room to breathe between character studies and plot twists.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 6\\n\r\nI was absolutely engaged with every moment of Kaiba in the first half of the show.  The worlds were lush, beautiful and captivating, with the focus characters of each episode enticing and conflicted.  I especially loved the dark mature tone and themes present in the series.  However, after that first half, as well put together as everything was, it was equally off kilter in the latter half.  Connections didn&rsquo;t quite read on screen when they needed to, and the ending was honestly one of the worst in my opinion.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI just finished Kaiba. I actively avoided this show last year, and after completion, I'm quite disappointed that I did. The discussion I would have had while watching it would have been fun. This is an exceptional show, yet very flawed, and I actually had to look back in the comments section after certain episodes to see if I was the only one confused with certain character/plot developments, and I wasn't. I don't think Kaiba is something you watch unless your taste level has reached a certain point, so enjoyment will definitely sway because of that. I'm torn between a 7 and an 8, but the story was just so terrible at the end that I can't give it an 8 in good conscience.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7",

            "content": "Kaiba is a Sci-fi, Adventure, Romance, Drama featuring some questionable abstract art. With such a surreal concept on &lsquo;memories&rsquo;, only those who are able to see this anime for its originality will be able to fully appreciate it.\r\nIt&rsquo;s set in a world where dying doesn&rsquo;t matter, as long as you have your memories you can be reborn into another body. This is certainly a fascinating premise and the series does a great job in raising some serious issues that arise due to this perpetual world. The story itself focuses on some guy named Kaiba, who wakes up with no recollection of anything about himself. Itseems to have a similar story telling style as the more widely known series &lsquo;Kino&rsquo;s Journey&rsquo;, where our protagonist journeys to weird and wonderful places and quickly gets involved in other people&rsquo;s live stories. Major difference is that Kaiba&rsquo;s journey actually holds a purpose, as it&rsquo;s more on a journey of self-discovery. This series has a non-linear storyline, making it is almost impossible to tell which direction the story is heading. All that&rsquo;s left is to enjoy the emotional ride of this surreal sci-fi series, though things do get a bit hectic later on.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of this series are genuinely hard to judge, not only because there are so many of them involved but because ones that truly count are very complex. For most of the first half, this series is purely episodic and the various non-recurring characters do bring something of their own to the story. Then there are the few main characters that are intricately woven into the story and you&rsquo;ll get to learn bit by bit about them and their memories. Kaiba &amp; Neiro are the most captivating of them all.\\n\\n\r\nThen there&rsquo;s the animation and most people will be wondering why I gave it such a high score. However where the animation lacks in any sense of realism or detail, it sure makes up for it with pure creativity and imaginative design. The music goes well with it, as there are a variety of entrancing tunes and melodies that will get anyone caught-up in the moment. Same goes for the sound FX, which really stands out during the amazing action sequences.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Kaiba is one of the more original anime I have come across in a while, which can truly capture many viewers. On the other hand the story is rather confusing and there are numerous issues that aren&rsquo;t made clear, although it certainly did a good job in the limited time it had. I can positively say that this series isn&rsquo;t for everyone, nevertheless if you can look past the childish animation then you may be able to appreciate this mature show.\\n\\n\r\n^_^",

The market is frequently bashed for pumping out the same old otaku-pandering crap every single season and losing sight of its artistic and intellectual roots.  High school slice-of-life after high school slice-of-life is announced toa chorus of groans as we all scream \u201cI want something unique!\u201d\\n\\n\r\nWell, y\u2019know what anime fans? I call bullshit. Apparently, you don\u2019t want innovation; you want more clich\u00e9 harem action-comedies that take place in otaku-paradise fantasy worlds with badass male protagonists, because that\u2019s the only kind of thing that gets popular nowadays. You don\u2019t know what you want. If you wanted innovation, then unique masterpieces that aren\u2019t afraid to be experimental and push boundaries wouldn\u2019t somehow manage to go completely unnoticed. If you wanted innovation, Kaiba would be as popular as SAO is now. Instead, it barely cracks the top 1000.\\n\\n\r\nSo what exactly makes Kaiba such a masterpiece? Why does the fact that its only popularity stems from a small cult following of director Masaaki Yuasa (who you may know from Tatami Galaxy or Ping Pong the Animation) create such outrage? Well, that\u2019s a loaded question. Obligatory review-intro aside, let\u2019s delve into one of my all time favorite anime:\\n\\n\r\nSynopsis: In this world, technology exists that makes it possible to store human memories as data, so that the death of your body is not actually death. As memories are stored in databanks, they can be transferred into new and different bodies. Because so-called \"memory trading\" now occurs, it is now possible to steal memories, illegally alter them, sell them, etc. Good memories can be downloaded and bad ones can be erased; a luxury only available to the rich and powerful. One day, a man awakens in a ruined room. His name is Kaiba. Kaiba has no memories of his own, but he does have a lot to figure out about his past.\\n\\n\r\nBesides the artwork (more on that later), the first thing that stands out about Kaiba is how INCREADIBLE its world-building is.  Not only is it a world rich with creativity and depth, but so much about it is conveyed with so little exposition. This anime tells its story through expressions, thoughts, symbolism, and other devices that don\u2019t need to be spoken aloud more than it does through traditional methods, and that is arguably the most beautiful part about it. SO much emotion is conveyed in this twisted, thought-provoking setting that blurs the lines of ethics, morality, and individualism.  This is a very philosophical show, but it\u2019s FAR from pretentious or preachy; it rarely, if ever overtly discusses these serious topics, but rather conveys them without words. While that aspect may serve to potentially alienate viewers who don\u2019t like to think about what they are watching, to hell with them; be prepared to absorb a lot of different ideas and concepts when you watch this show. Kaiba tells a tale that not only sucks us into its universe and makes us care deeply about its characters, but it also causes us to think in ways that we likely never have before. While Kaiba\u2019s tranquil mood and bright color pallet may mask the mature nature of the show, make no mistake that this is one of the most meticulously crafted, subtly brilliant, and perfectly paced plots I\u2019ve ever had the pleasure of experiencing. There is much more I could say, but no words I come up with will ever be able to do Kaiba justice. You simply have to watch it for yourself to understand.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are my favorite part about Kaiba; it is without a doubt one of the most incredible and memorable casts of all time. There are no good guys, there are no bad guys. There are only people; people with very distinct, very moving desires, motivations, and pasts. I cared more deeply for this cast of characters then I did for any other anime cast in a long, long time. Even the episodic characters that don\u2019t get much screen time find their way into the hearts of the viewers. I\u2019m STILL in awe of how masterfully executed the characterization of the side-characters was; even people who were only around for a single episode felt so genuinely human and fleshed out. Even they, however, have nothing on the trio of Kaiba, Neiro, and Popo, who stand out as some of the most multi-faceted characters imaginable. In addition to the sheer depth of the cast, it must be noted that the chemistry between the characters is stupendous. The emotional connections that the characters make with one another are remarkably authentic and believable. In short, these characters feel human. Very human. Their respective personalities carry the show and serve as perfect vessels for the show\u2019s central themes; this is character writing at its absolute finest ladies and gentlemen.\\n\\n\r\nBy far the most controversial part about Kaiba is its artwork, but by no means should that be the case. It absolutely sickens me to think that such an experimental, refreshing, visually appealing, and one of a kind art style can be the primary reason that this show never became popular. The bold colors and lines serve the narrative beautifully as they create a fluid world full of intrigue and surrealist imagery that leave a lasting impression on the audience. I don\u2019t care that it\u2019s simplistic; as far as I\u2019m concerned, this animation is near-perfect and you will never see anything else like it. Tag on the hauntingly beautiful and mood-setting OST along with a very memorable OP/ED set and you have yourself some outstanding and uniquely brilliant production values.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion\u2026 WHY THE HELL HAS NOBODY SEEN THIS? Kaiba is one of the most unique and incredible works the industry has ever produced and yet I have not heard it brought up in a conversation so much as once. Anime fans, do yourself a giant favor and find a way to watch this incredible series. It reminded me why I am a fan of the medium in the first place. Maybe it can do the same for you.",

            "content": "The universe sits atop a house of cards, with revolution shaking at the base. And Kaiba truly does hold an entire universe in its hands. \r\nThis is Sci-Fi through and through, and every bit of it overflows with imagination and experimentation. The strongest aspect of this show is how comfortable the writers felt in their own world. They put passion into this, and tried to make something that would last in the audience's memories. Apart from any pacing or plot problems that may have arisen, this was written in confidence. None of the lesser points are because of weak willed writers unwilling to be adventurous.If you want to see something different and intriguing, I give a hearty recommendation on that basis alone. If you also happen to be a fan of Sci-Fi, well then, sharpen your knives and prepare for a feast. (Viewers with little patience should probably sit this one out though.) \\n\\n\r\nRight off the bat, Kaiba starts with a character that has amnesia, and that sends up a bunch of warning signals. Many stories with poor writing will proudly display an amnesiac protagonist because it frees up the job of writing complex personality, pre-existing character interactions, and is just a giant gateway to spoon-feed plot and exposition to the audience. But do not fear, for Kaiba never once considers being a shoddy, overused amnesia story. In fact, the amnesia is more of just a presence that is ever-looming, not overbearing. They don't waste energy trying to cover holes with it, but instead rip apart the foundations of this trope and rebuild it anew, devoting the entire premise of this show to memories. Even if the execution wasn't masterful, they plunged head first into trying something different, and of course, that is where this show excels.\\n\\n\r\nWith the whole element of memory storage and body swapping, our main character Warp actually spends a great deal of time in a cheaply made, mute body, incapable of speaking. This does suppress how much of his personality can be expressed, and in the beginning, his position in the show isn't clear. The same can be said for many of his companions. But in the same manner that silent or minimalistic films make more from less, we are given brief moments to step into the mind of Warp. Each little morsel of his character development made more savory by their rarity and good delivery.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the same cannot be said about the entire cast. Kaiba is more about the story, and does sacrifice the quality of its supporting characters for the sake of plot points. Being partially episodic, Kaiba sometimes tries to cram entire character arcs into one or two sittings. Leaving the writers to fall back on melodrama to try and relay an expansive history or grand emotions in a compressed time. It can distance the viewer from the characters and belay the intentions of the production team. In other cases, certain episodes will excel within their limited time, and give us touching, memorable characters and anecdotes. This is a fluctuation in quality that wanes over time, leaving most of the second half solidly written.\\n\\n\r\nMuch like GitS: SAC, it's less of a classical narrative, and more of a series of experiences woven together. The precision is still there, and the plot takes you somewhere, just not in the typical manner. Power, lust, greed, lies, righteousness, pain, and bonds of friendship all weave an ever tightening noose that threatens to choke the ruling class. In the world of Kaiba, human equality isn\u2019t even an afterthought, and our crew is ready to take back their dignity, and a little more for good measure. Caught in a power struggle with ever shifting tides, the weak are forever pushed further into the abyss as the strong climb upwards. Puppets and scapegoats, forced into destructive bodies and unable to feel or draw happiness, they are scattered about as simple war machines. Despite all of their artificial power, they remain true helpless souls. With minds used, battered and abused, they dwell in the deepest pit carved by humanity, and sit there alone, betrayed by others' ambitions and their own tainted memories. Kaiba performs a tragic duel between our own identity, and the persona that others sculpt for us.\\n\\n\r\nKaiba takes up residence in the \"here's what we can do with anime as a medium\" category. It's artwork contests traditional design and usually comes up on top. On the technical side of things, it goes for fluidity rather than individual details, meaning this show rarely sits still. The frames keep turning, and action, reaction, and intricacy are all captured in the animation. They can afford to do this because of the simplistic character structures and complete lack of shading. Now this is a stylistic choice, and I think it goes well with the overall atmosphere of the show. At times it's truly jaw dropping, and you get the impression that any other style of art simply wouldn't have worked for this series. On the flip side, there are a few moments where nothing is happening, the movement stops, and the magic sort of drains away for a second. However, there is something in the art department that is uncontestedly good. The CG integration is hardly noticeable at all, even when the fast, sweeping shots cover a lot of background, it looks very smooth and naturally painted.\\n\\n\r\nSticking with story over characters, the score doesn't really have any character themes that show up like in other anime. There are mostly just soundtracks to enhance the action or accompany the mood of a scene. These only show up occasionally, and for the rest of the show, and bulk of it, we're given diegetic sounds and environmental noises that usually complement the atmosphere. In this aspect, it's not the best sound editing I've heard, but most of the time there are clean transitions, good sound effects, and nothing too obtrusively out of place. The music itself is poignant. The melodies of Kiyoshi Yoshida range from whimsical to pondering melancholy, and will stay with you long after the episode has run its course. Just like with Warp's character moments, the music is withheld until it's appropriate, and when it'll be cherished most by the audience. Now, while the compositions are very good, the implementation is a bit clumsy sometimes, and it can get noticeable when songs are reused too often.\\n\\n\r\nGiven how Kaiba tries to avoid dry heaps of exposition, the dialogue is an ever occurring source of world-building. Just like the viewer, Warp is trying to absorb everything from other people and his surroundings. This calls for more intricate writing, and is very effective in synchronizing the audience with the emotions and experiences of Warp, when it works. Sadly, the first couple of episodes were still exploring this, trying to find a solid tempo and direction, and so some of the scenes can feel scripted and unnatural. This is particularly noticeable with some moments of oddly placed comedy. But again, this all gets ironed out as the episode count grows, and it becomes a much smoother ride. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is above the standard fare, but won't have you clamoring to see the actors in other roles. Everyone does their job, and they do it well, particularly one actor who does deserve special mention. Hisao Egawa knocks it straight out of the park from the very moment he appears on screen. Providing the voice of Vanilla, he steps directly into the character, encapsulating the absurd, blundering, and over-the-top personality of our not so noble sheriff.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end we walk away with a very well controlled space oddity that radiates familiarity from the writers, as if they've spent part of their lives in this future universe. A superb drama? Not quite. But an intricate story that explores outside the realm of typical series. With that in mind, this is not a show meant to be watched casually. An attentive viewer is required to get the most out of what it has to offer. If you're looking for something to put on in the background, hold off on this show until you have time to truly watch it. Otherwise, get ready for a fantastic Sci-Fi experience.\\n\\n\r\nMy final verdict for this show is a respectable 8.4",

            "content": "Memories. They\u2019re a wonderful thing, aren\u2019t they? The ability to transport our minds back to simpler times of childhood; to look back and reflect on days gone by and to appreciate the various things we did years ago, whether that was experiencing our awkward first love during adolescence, an old friend whom you used to play with as a child, or just simple family gatherings whether that be for the celebration of some kind of event be it Christmas or Thanksgiving, or just gathering around to watch a movie together. But, there are also the bad memories, that I\u2019m sure everyone has. The memories wewould want to erase from our mind, and would do so in a heartbeat if given the opportunity to do so. Our memories of past experiences, both the good and the bad, are what shapes the person we are today, and the entire theme surrounding memories has been tackled in plenty of dystopian and cyberpunk narratives in films over the years, but the one piece of media that I have seen that tackles this idea to its fullest capabilities, in the most creative and beautiful way I might add, is Masaki Yuasa\u2019s Kaiba! If you\u2019re familiar with my past reviews, then you know that I\u2019ve praised this man\u2019s works to no end, that being The Tatami Galaxy and Ping Pong, two anime that I absolutely adore, and are some of my favourites works in the entire medium, with Kaiba being no exception to that. Kaiba is a wonderfully creative endeavour with its experimental and imaginative world, setting and characters, that not only has become one of my personal favourite anime as of late, but is a delightful reminder of why I love animation so much, and all of the endless creative potentials it can bring along with it, culminating in a work that emotionally moved me in ways that no other anime or film has been able to in a long time. It\u2019s like if Masaki Yuasa, smoked a ton of drugs and Kaiba\u2019s unique visuals was the product of his hallucinations. Anyway, with that all said and done, let\u2019s dive into the mad world that is Kaiba!\\n\\n\r\nSet in a world in which one\u2019s memories can be stored in small devices known as \u201cchips\u201d, people can live on, even when their body has lived passed its physical limitations, or has been badly destroyed, and have their memories implanted into another host, thus living on. In addition, the inhabitants of the world of Kaiba can chose to have their memories altered in several ways, adding new happier memories, or removing those memories that are too painful to bear. However, this comes at a catch, as only the rich and powerful can afford to transplant their memories into new hosts, with them ruling from the top, whilst the rest of the world is left at the bottom, a world without authority, in which the illegal alteration and trafficking of bodies and memories runs rampant. In this world, our main protagonist, Kaiba, travels throughout the land, with no memories of his own, as he meets new people and encounters new planets, eventually gaining his memory once again.\\n\\n\r\nKaiba\u2019s narrative can essentially be split into two halves; the first of which deals with Kaiba in a more episodic narrative structure as he travels from planet to planet, meeting new people, learning about their experiences and the world, with the second half becoming more plot-heavy involving a resistance group fighting against the tyrannical rule of Warp, the ruler of this world. Now, it is not my proactive to insinuate that you have to wait several episodes for Kaiba to \u201cget good\u201d or more plot-heavy. I\u2019d argue in fact that the first half of the series is more emotionally heavy in many ways than that of the second half, with each episode being its own self-contained emotional rollercoaster, all of which were able to resonate with me on some kind of emotional level. Every character Kaiba meets in the first half of the series, despite their simplistic characters as a whole, are still able to convey a wonderful story in their own respective episodes, packing an insane emotional punch at the climax for each one. Every episode explores something different about the world, and adds on to our understanding of said world, and the sheer number of themes and ideas that is pumped into the show, all the while allowing each respective theme time to develop and breath, is staggering and a true testament of the writing of the series. From episodes in which one has to come to the reality of losing a loved one, and having to come to grips with that loss, to a deeper look and understanding of sexuality and gender, and what this truly means when we see both Kaiba, whom now has moved his memories into a woman\u2019s body, and another character, whom he meets, who has done the opposite, to how memories are stored in this world, and how they\u2019re managed. Each episode in the first half the anime is rich in themes and ideas, and keeps building on our understanding of this world, and the way in which it operates, all of which I found to be deeply interesting! It deals with the loss of loved ones, the valuable nature of memories, the cost at which humans are willing to prolong their own, and their loved ones lives, and manages to tell captivating stories around these ideas, with characters that have boat loads of heart. While one may argue that I am being manipulated into feeling something for these characters, through the use of an emotional backstory, something that I myself have complained about in other shows before, but the characters in Kaiba never came across to me as if they were designed as a means of manipulating my emotions. Each one is grounded in their stories, and the fantastic writing and character interactions, as well as their clearly defined personalities, makes them feel incredibly human and real to me, so that when any unfortunate event does occur, I feel the emotional weight the show is trying to convey, and it\u2019s the main reason why I can get so invested in the world and the characters, so much so, that some episodes even brought me to tears! (Real men shed tears when watching cartoons, okay!)\\n\\n\r\nIn addition to all this, the world and setting of Kaiba, and all of the locales he travels to within the first half the story, are incredibly memorable, all of whom take on such vivid personalities in my mind. Not only is this incredibly effective at worldbuilding, but the extremely well-designed locals also help me become more invested in the show I am watching, and this also extends to the creative technology the show is filled with too, from belts that can grow legs to help move past terrain quickly, to a strange looking gun that is capable of melting bodies with one simple blast! In addition, during these episodes, Kaiba will often use a similar sort of gun, in order to gain access into their memories and their subconscious. It\u2019s used as a creative way to inform the audience about the psychological implications each character is facing, while laying down the ground work in order to give the audience subtle little hints into Kaiba\u2019s past, making the process of learning about his complete backstory in the second half, feel that more gratifying and satisfying. Each creative element in the show, from the setting to the technology, is used to enhance the narrative, and its clear how much love and thought was placed into making the world as wonderfully unique as possible.\\n\\n\r\nThe narrative is also just incredibly satisfying to watch play out, with constant forks in the road and plot twists to keep things interesting, and to constantly keep me second guessing. It\u2019s that feeling of satisfaction you get when watching a mystery play out, and seeing all the pieces come together in your mind that you say to yourself, \u201cah!\u201d as a cartoony light-bulb pings above your head. Kaiba in a way, is a mystery narrative, with Kaiba attempting to learn about the true nature of where he came from, and who he is, which comes to fruition in the second half, where the constant questions we were posed with in the beginning get answered. This mainly functions as a means to get the audience invested in Kaiba as a character, and all of the constituent characters in his past too, but I believe that by starting Kaiba with no knowledge of the world or how it works was greatly beneficial to the overall story. Much like how Kaiba knows nothing of this world, neither do we as an audience member, and we experience the world through his eyes. Everything Kaiba experiences and feels, so do we, and not only does this make the emotional moments all the more hard hitting, but it helps us get invested in this character and feel as if we\u2019re really embarking on a journey with him. Information about the world therefore, is offered through the visuals and what Kaiba sees, allowing the audience to try and piece things together, and I believe this is particularly effective in the first episode in which Kaiba watches from afar, the activities of the people of this world. Through their actions, and behaviours, we understand a lot about this world, and the circumstances of what it is like to live there, from seeing a couple having a fight, whereupon the woman walks out proclaiming she has had enough of this world (which sounds a lot like Tommy Wiseau now that I think about it; I swear that was not my intention when I wrote the first draft for this), to a group of people rummaging through memory chips, and selling those they do not want anymore, to an old man who tells Kaiba he has seen the entire world, for it to be known to us, by his wife pulling him away, that none of that has happened, and that he has gone Senile for living in this place for so long. All of these little things help to paint a picture of the world at large without having to resort to expository dialogue, and this may seem like a pedantic thing to praise, but its small little things like this that I notice and end up appreciating. It\u2019s going that little extra mile, is what makes a show truly special to me, and Kaiba is full of this!\\n\\n\r\nKaiba\u2019s characters are also great, and, as I\u2019ve already expressed greatly in regards to the people whom we meet in the first half of the series, all of whom, despite being rather simplistic, still are able to resonate with me emotionally. One of the better examples, is Vanilla, a character that falls in love with our protagonist Kaiba, after Kaiba transfers his memories into the body of a girl in the third episode. While Vanilla is most regulated to be the bumbling idiot, with a gut the size of a house, and is a complete asshole, this fat bastard did actually manage to make me cry in the seventh episode of the show. He genuinely cares for that of Kaiba (now in the body of a girl called Chroniko) and he even remarks that he is not able to save his mother anymore, as he had been holding her memory chip this entire time, suggesting a more compassionate and caring person then we were lead to believe at first. Kaiba\u2019s other characters, particularly those whom we meet in the second half in the resistance group against the rich high above are hard to talk about without going into spoiler territory, and I don\u2019t want to rob any of those who haven\u2019t seen Kaiba yet of their charm and overall impact in the story. What I will say, is that the relationships between some of the characters, namely that of Kaiba\u2019s and Neiro\u2019s, fills natural and organic, as if they\u2019re really two people who genuinely care deeply about one another, making the events that happen between them, all the more emotional to me, since I was deeply invested in both of them as actual people.  \\n\\n\r\nAs previously mentioned, the world of Kaiba is amazing, and that also extends to the animation as well. Kaiba utilises so many different animation techniques, and is constantly changing its style during much of its runtime; it\u2019s a visual orgasm! It\u2019s also a show that nails the more cartoony-esque art style, with plenty of stretch-and-pull for that cartoony sort of aesthetic and vibe, with some of the most memorable and interesting character designs I\u2019ve seen from an anime as well. The more childlike imagery and designs, also contrasts well with the more adult-oriented themes, mainly of the cruelty of the world, a tone and juxtaposition I liked a lot in the show. There are even plenty of times when the animation can downright be stunning, such as in the case where Vanilla and Choroniko are represented as two brightly lit neon coloured figures in the night sky. The entire show is dripping with personality and it\u2019s clear how much passion and work was put into the animation. One little feature I also loved was the scale of the world in regards to the size of the characters, and helped to insinuate the difference in power and class between that of the rich and that of the poor. The music, likewise, is also wonderful. The opening track, Never, is nothing short of what I would call beautiful, with its soft, almost melancholic at times, lyrics and singing. Other tracks I adored were Planets, Initialise me and Twinkling Photon. Every track in Kaiba is wonderfully composed and each track I can recite in my head with no problem; they\u2019re that memorable to me, setting the atmosphere for each locale, bringing each one to life! (Also, is it just me, or does the track \u201cChase to it!\u201d sound like something that would fit right at home in the original Terminator movie?)\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, if it weren\u2019t evident by now, I love Kaiba! While I dislike using this term, for any piece of media to describe anything, considering how incredibly subjective it is, I feel as if it is necessary for this show, and that is that Kaiba is a beautiful work of art. Through it\u2019s amazing world, characters, charm and personality, Kaiba was a series I was able to get deeply invested in whilst watching, and I loved every second of this show. It succeeds in every area, telling a rich and powerfully emotional story, and while some of the characters Kaiba meets in the first half can be rather simplistic, I believe that the writing is strong enough to salvage such characters, grounding them in a sense of believability and realism. Kaiba checks off all of my boxes for what I look for in anime, and just proves even more why Masaki Yuasa is one of my favourite auteurs in this medium, with his \u201cbig three\u201d (that including the show I\u2019m currently talking about, Tatami and Ping Pong) being some of the best works in anime, in my humblest opinion, and I\u2019d recommend checking out all three if you have not done so already. Kaiba is a show that I won\u2019t be forgetting any time soon\u2026\\n",

            "content": "There's a scene in the first episode of Kaiba where our main character sits in the main foyer of this small community, watching as various bits of human drama happens around him. This scene is a lesson in introductory worldbuilding. Kaiba is an extraordinarily complicated science fiction world in which bodies are disposable and one can acquire a new body by transporting your mind from one to another. You infer all of that from a series of scenes in which some people are trying to work out which person's mind is installed on each of these new memory chips. Other people walk past complaining theytheir friend has changed since getting their new body, while another family moans and complains that they've got to share this cheap, immobile body because they're too poor to afford better ones. It's a brilliant piece of writing and directing that manages to divulge the information you need to understand the world while telling small individual funny stories in the process. It's the massively preferable alternative to the infodump many other shows choose.\\n\\n\r\nThat scene in the opening episode sets up largely what Kaiba is about. This is a world in which both bodies and memories can be bought and sold and what sort of scenarios would happen if that was the case. A young girl sells her body to a rich collector with her mind being put temporarily in storage so her family can feed themselves. A very strange person sticks her mind into another body so she can have sex with her own body. As our amnesiac main character travels from planet to planet with only a very vague goal in mind (with half of that time in the body of a mute inflatable hippo) we see this vast universe and what weird ways society reacts when these scientific advances occur. It is science fiction at its absolute best in that regard. With these scientific advances it shows how it changes the world, from the rich to the poor, from the old to the young, from the charitable to the selfish, from love to hate.\\n\\n\r\nThe best episode of Kaiba is where he visits the super rich planet where people are buying and disposing of bodies within weeks as the newest ones come into fashion. The streets are lined with advertisements for the latest bodies of varying ridiculousness and impracticality. People strut down catwalks with their new five-limbed, three-headed bodies. The latest and hippest body fashion trend is decided by Patch, a genius artist who designs bodies for a living. However when our main character visits Patch, it turns out he is a mad old creature cut off from the world. He hates the rampant spending of the upper class and he tries to punish them by designing increasingly impractical and stupid looking bodies. As soon as those bodies are put into mass production though, advertising immediately sells them as the next big thing and we see people walking the streets with those very bodies Patch just described as horribly impractical and stupid.\\n\\n\r\nIt's an absolutely genius episode in so many ways. Like the best science fiction it shows that as much as science might change, society will still act in pretty similar ways. The more things change, the more they stay the same. Patch's creation of impractical bodies mocking the upper class who then proceed to buy them anyway without understanding the irony reminds me of rich people spending millions on Banksy art pieces. A bunch of those are specifically targeting the follies of the upper class and their wasteful approach towards spending money on the impractical, yet there they are buying those exact street scrawled art pieces. There are other little pieces of genius in that episode, such as the fact people live by eating the processed scraps of old discarded bodies, or that one of the more popular designed bodies is based on an attractive terrorist that has been on the news lately, or that Patch has a little dog he cobbled together from bits of thrown out older dogs \"because they want foreign dogs that look better than the local ones\". The levels of social commentary Kaiba creates from its science fiction is masterful.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately Kaiba has an overarching story and that's where it all starts to fall apart a little. The story in concept is pretty good actually, because it draws from the same \"what if\" scenario the rest of the small stories draw from. It's basically a love story in which two Romeo and Juliet styled characters from different societies fall in love and somehow stay in love even when they change bodies, have both their minds altered and are told to kill each other. It's a touching story about the POWAH OF LURVE that Kaiba manages to do an excellent job of exploring for the first two thirds of the series, but really starts to fuck it up towards the end. It starts to introduce too many characters with their own little desires and stories who start to take up more screentime. Some of these stories are interesting but they try to cram in too much into too small a time. There's only 12 episodes in Kaiba and the first 8 episodes of this are individual episodic stories. There are only 3 characters that truly matter and if they could cut out all the ancillary bullshit we would have had a much better and more satisfying conclusion that I would have been able to follow.\\n\\n\r\nThe last two episodes in particular are pretty awful. Kaiba basically turns into End of Evangelion. No really, when I say End of Eva I really mean it. One character wants the world to become one mind so they stop feeling pain anymore and then a whole load of imagery happens that's impossible to follow and then at the end everyone ends up on a beach looking confused. It's way more hopeful and positive than End of Eva's tirade of hate and self-loathing. Instead of feeling confused and dirty like you've just swam through a sewage infested river like End of Eva, at the end of Kaiba you feel confused but mildly content like you've just been swimming through a sea of dandelion seeds. I saw Kaiba back in 2008 when it first came out and I remembered the ending being a letdown, but rewatching it really brought into stark relief what an awful ending it has. It's a shame because the rest of the show is one of the best implementations of science fiction in any piece of fiction ever. I would still highly recommend people watch it. Just be prepared for a confusing and unsatisfying ending.",

            "content": "[INTRODUCTION]\r\nKaiba is a show that everyone should watch. Not because anything that it does story-wise is particularly spectacular, but because of how fundamentally different it is from everything else in terms of raw artistry with its music and visuals. It's not an outstandingly good show, but everything that it presents to the viewer is just so damn unique and interesting that I can't help but recommend it. The concept itself may not be original, but the execution certainly is, and it's the execution that makes this show worth watching.\r\nSTORY [5/10]\r\nKaiba takes place in a world where people can transfer their minds between each other's bodies.It explores the consequences of doing so by showing how various characters' lives are ruined by the cruelty of this society. The hero is an amnesiac who finds himself under attack in a mysterious room, holding a locket which contains the picture of a girl who is a wanted terrorist. Although interesting, the premise itself is nothing new. What makes it stand out in Kaiba is the overall atmosphere of the show.\\n\\n\r\nWhile most cyberpunk shows would go for an action-packed, thrilling adventure story about a group of rebels overthrowing this system, Kaiba instead focuses on the more intimate and emotional aspects of the mind-swapping process, for better or for worse. The first half of the series is very episodic in nature, a collection of slightly connected fables each focusing on a different cast of characters and how they have been touched by the mind-swapping technology. These episodes are very, very sad, sometimes so much so that it can be difficult to suspend one's disbelief. Additionally, these episodes are very hit-or-miss. Some are great, and some aren't. Although some characters are easy to get emotionally invested in, others just kind of exist and force you to sit through their episode, hoping that the next one will be more interesting.\\n\\n\r\nAs the story progresses and more information about our hero's past is revealed, a plot begins to take shape, ditching the episodic structure around episode 9. At this point, lots of unexpected, bizarre, and exciting things happen. If you haven't been paying close attention, it may be difficult to understand or enjoy what is going on. It's worth noting that some viewers have complained that the ending of Kaiba feels \"rushed,\" but I didn't have this problem. Some of the twists near the end do, however, have a habit of feeling forced or random, which can be a problem if you already had trouble suspending your disbelief through the episodic portion.\\n\\n\r\nBy the way, this show is not for children. It's confusing, violent, depressing, and sexual. The character designs might look cute, but, as many anime fans know, this means nothing in regard to how the actual story will play out. If you're looking for a family-friendly show, find something else.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS [5/10]\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Kaiba are defined by their experiences, not their personalities. Much like the episodes themselves, not every character is immediately interesting. Many of the characters carry their own episodes - if you like a character, you'll probably like their episode. If not, well... tough luck. Because their personalities aren't as developed as their backstories, no characters are especially memorable or unusual, and a few of them are difficult to sympathize with, which is a grave flaw in a tragedy-based show. \\n\\n\r\nThe most interesting thing about the characters is that they don't have static designs. Because of the mind-swapping sci-fi shenanigans which are always present, you'll see different characters using a single body at different times, single characters hopping between many different bodies, and personalities shifting seemingly at random. This is difficult to get used to at the beginning, especially because many of the characters' personalities aren't immediately apparent, and you will probably need a sheet to keep track of whose mind is in whose body at any given time.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of character relationships, the main focus is on the romance between Warp and Neiro, which is interesting because of how they love each other even through different bodies. Much like a Makoto Shinkai film, Kaiba dwells on the bittersweet separation between two lovers - something that I've never cared for, but that I can't deny is an intriguing aspect of the story.\\n\\n\r\nART [9/10]\\n\\n\r\nStudio Madhouse is known for the quality of their artwork, but they really outdid themselves here. Rather than using traditional anime character designs, they opted for a much more avant-garde style, one reminiscent of mid-20th century American cartoons. The drawings in Kaiba are heavily stylized, soft, and round, looking almost like they were shaped out of play-doh or drawn by a child. Rather than feeling lazily put-together, this only makes the characters all the more endearing. There is a certain human frailty which is conveyed through the use of these designs, one that enforces the story's themes much better than most anime artwork could.\\n\\n\r\nThe simplicity of the character designs also allows for the animators to do much more with their movement. Even by Madhouse standards, the action is especially fluid and captivating, and a surprising amount of emotion can be conveyed through simple facial expressions and body language. This is, of course, all thanks to the talent of Misaaki Yuasa, the avant-garde directorial genius behind The Tatami Galaxy and Ping Pong: the Animation.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the characters look small, fragile, and easily moved by their environment, the backgrounds are a stark contrast in their imposing nature, characterized by towering cliffs and tiny windows carved into the walls of threatening castles and spaceships. The oppressive feeling given by the backgrounds really adds to the story's overall emotional impact, and Kaiba would feel incomplete without the art presented in the way that it is.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND [8/10]\\n\\n\r\nMy favorite part of this show was its soundtrack. Kiyoshi Yoshida and Seira Kagami did a wonderful job with the OP, which remains among my favorites for its soothing, simplistic, and somehow still emotionally rich melody and instrumentation. The soundtrack makes very good use of synthesizers and non-acoustic noises to heighten the mysterious, sci-fi vibe that the show gives off, and it thankfully stays hauntingly beautiful because it never goes overboard with loudness or complexity. My only complaint is that there were only a few different songs used in the show - as great as many of them are, they can get old after a few listens.\\n\\n\r\nNot the OP, though. That will never get old.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT [5/10] -- FINAL SCORE [6.4/10]\\n\\n\r\nWhile I can certainly appreciate how unique Kaiba's artwork is, it occasionally left me feeling a bit more alienated than I believe was intended. On the personal side of things, I've never been much for romances or gratuitously emotional dramas, so there were parts of the show that I just couldn't enjoy as much as I feel most viewers would. Nonetheless, Kaiba is an anime that I'm not likely to forget anytime soon, and is one that everyone needs to watch.\\n\\n\r\nAlso recommended: Flip Flappers, Serial Experiments Lain, The Tatami Galaxy",

            "content": "Great works of art are not easy to review. They are not common like the cesspool of bad art. Bad art is easy to deconstruct, to show how pathetically horrible they are. \u201cSo bad it\u2019s good\u201d exists because these works are so bizarre, so extraordinary that they become unique. Bad art is never unique its badness. In contrast, great works of art always end up redefining what \u2018good\u2019 is, so any review of a masterpiece will never be analytical and conclusive. It always end up chasing something that we can only grasp a piece of, like a poet looking at a beautiful line he wroteand knowing he can never write a worthy poem of it.\\n\\n\r\nKaiba is one of those artworks. I say it deliberately. Judgment of it is not confined to anime. It transcends media, reaches something so deeply human and awe-inspiring that it becomes a part of you. Do not expect a rational explanation of why this anime is better than pretty much anything. If we understood completely why it\u2019s so good, we\u2019d have masterpiece dropping from the skies. I can try, though.\\n\\n\r\nThe key to understanding Kaiba is understanding how it tells a story, specifically how it takes advantage of the personal nature of fiction. All art, including fiction, is personal. It is a product of human thought, a translation of your entire Being \u2013 your experiences, philosophy, unconscious, passions \u2013 into some kind of experience that another being can take on. Kaiba is a ridiculously expressive work. Every scene is imbued with emotion. Every object says something about what it represents. It\u2019s so emotionally draining because of that.\\n\\n\r\nMemory is the big topic, but Kaiba isn\u2019t just about memory. In a cliched way, it\u2019s existentialist, asking what we are. Its answer is memories, but memories are also information. The anime explores this intersection of information that defines us. Notice the symbols. When memory isn\u2019t converted to information, it is organic and free \u2013 it is lifelike memory eggs. These are also tiny, fragile and fleeting. The memories float away and are easily lost.\\n\\n\r\nThe roe is us, so they use to show how tiny we are when death strikes. When a character dies, their bodies become liquid and vanish completely. The \u2018self\u2019 becomes just a bunch of yellow pieces floating way. It expresses the loss of death, how death completely erase us and we become nothing. The memory chip \u2013 a drill-like thing \u2013 can also die so easily, if it\u2019s lost it\u2019s gone forever. Sure, we can try to capture those roe or to protect the chip, but it\u2019s so difficult. It\u2019s an expression of how fragile we are.\\n\\n\r\nYet converting ourselves into information makes us so much easier to control, and easier for us to control others. Altering other people\u2019s memories is a sci-fi trope, but this anime is concerned with how it affects everyone, how it affects our personal lives. We see the small results of this \u2013 how erasing someone\u2019s childhood erases who they are and they end up becoming nothing but a memory. How this power to change personal reality blurs into thinking we can change reality itself \u2013 a direct link to megalomania and tyranny.\\n\\n\r\nOur memories are our personality. Once we control them, edit them, change them all lines break down. The world of Kaiba looks funny by design, but that\u2019s because how the people experience it. People can also put their memories into a whole new body. In one episode this results in a world where bodies are manufactured like clothes. Its reality is grotesque, a mass of weird shapes that\u2019s disorientating. Somehow we ended up creating a more chaotic reality than nature.\\n\\n\r\nLeaning towards a socioeconomic critique of society, the anime shows a world in which memories \u2013 selves \u2013 become products. So a character sells her own body with hopes that her memory will be kept. Selves are no longer precious. This society isn\u2019t painted with strokes of black to show you how evil rich people are. Rather, to illustrate the chaos of it, we see selling your own body and putting yourself in a chip is no guarantee. You\u2019re relinquishing control of yourself, your grip on the world.\\n\\n\r\nYet this \u2018information\u2019 is never just \u2018information\u2019. Consciousness was the result of accumalating all these pieces of data and connecting them. So we\u2019re never really dead, and using memories this way is using people as objects. The anime is deeply concerned with living things. In a gallery of memories, the people who own these memories cry out to be released.\\n\\n\r\nEveryone\u2019s concerns are always personal. Although the characters are simple, they have motivation and a humanity. A sheriff who really wants a girl at first seems like a greedy bastard, but he\u2019s a person. That\u2019s his wants, and when we see this want doesn\u2019t make him just an asshole but a good person we\u2019re encouraged to sympathize with him. In the end, he\u2019s a \u2018human\u2019 being \u2013 with people he loves, things he wants, and dreams lost when death comes.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough there are antagonists, the series always reminds us that they\u2019re people in the most simple way. People want power, but not because they\u2019re evil. They want it because they\u2019re human beings, so we see the ringleader of the resistance crumbling to tears when he realizes what he\u2019s done. He had to erase memories that painted him in a bad light, but the result was losing a friend.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is in the end about treasuring people. The idea of memory is just a tool to show us how we can lose people, no matter how hard we work to keep them. We put their identity, their whole being in a chip but then that chip is lost. We sell a loved one\u2019s body, hoping the salesman will keep the information in a chip. A friend blocks our ambition, so we erase some memories only to realize the whole person is gone. Eventually this anime reaches an important conclusion about being \u2013 we need each other, we\u2019re social animals, power doens\u2019t make up for it.\\n\\n\r\nThe castle of Warp is a lonely place. The only person he has is an all-seeing robot. He\u2019s not happy and the only thing he can talk about are who to execute. He may be the king of memories, but these are his own memories. What good are they? In a beautiful scene Popo and the resistance at the palace, and it has a huge opening to a black void. That\u2019s the height of power to you, a lonely high place looking out into nothing. The only thing that\u2019s there are themselves, yet they\u2019re craving control.\\n\\n\r\nThe romance between Neiro and Kaiba isn\u2019t a symbol for romance, but what\u2019s really important \u2013 connection. Even during oppression, they found something of their own, a precious shared memory that\u2019s enough. Separate yourself from the struggle for power. The privileges of the rich to put themselves in memory chips and live forever aren\u2019t that worthwhile in the end. Every world touched by this is grotesque, people are lost yet they are still people.\\n\\n\r\nYou cannot talk about the art without mentioning the Neverhood, which seems like a direct inspiration for the anime. Both endings and beginning borrow from it. It opens with a man seeing an unknown, bizarre world. The ending includes a darker version of the hero and a gigantic, self-sacrificing robot. Like the Neverhood, the design is cartoonish, nonsensical and imbued with meaning and emotions. Look at the planet where the only thing that matters is the story of two old people. The planet itself is nothing but their tower. The underworld is almost colorless \u2013 but almost, since it still has some life in it. The club is colorful and weird but has a dominating shade of purple \u2013 a disorientating effect. Vanilla looks like what we expect from an asshole with the fat belly and aggressive face (Only his character later proves to be more). There is even a creature who flies by a propeller and doesn\u2019t speak \u2013 like the sidekick from old video games. It\u2019s as unrealistic as you get, but no scene is without emotional overtones just like life \u2013 and that makes it far closer to reality than anything else.\\n\\n\r\nLikewise the soundtrack couldn\u2019t be better, a collection of gentle electronic sounds. It fits with the slightly childish designs, but it has the same fragility of the world. A lot of it sounds like Boards of Canada, only it takes it to less nostalgic tones. The soundtrack mostly expresses a reflective, introspective atmosphere, one of both awe and terror. Some tracks are colder and harsher that reminds us that this world is still harsh, a world where selves can be sold. Some tracks have beautiful, intimate melodies to go along with the theme of connection.\\n\\n\r\nThere is no other anime like Kaiba, an anime so expressive, where every shot is charged with emotion, wonder, terror and humanity. \u2018Depth\u2019 isn\u2019t the right word. It\u2019s not an intellectual, symbolic exercise like Paranoia Agent or a psychological exploration like Digimon Tamers yet it\u2019s somehow better than these two. Perhaps because it takes anime to the origin of art \u2013 the expression, not explanation, of human experience. Nothing I could write would do this anime justice.",

            "content": "This review spoils the entirety of Kaiba and is advised only for those who have completed the series.\r\nOf Masaaki Yuasa's main three anime series (Kaiba, The Tatami Galaxy, and Ping Pong the Animation), Kaiba is arguably the most ambitious but also the most flawed. It weaves an overarching story while gradually building upon the distinct world it's set within, but along the process struggles with particular plot points being rushed, questionable actions, particular occurrences insufficiently explained, and particular contrivances. \r\nThe ways in which Kaiba is able to expand upon its world while maintaining a level of imagination often uncommon in the anime medium is itsstrongest point. Paralleling it's cartoony art-style, many of Kaiba's sci-fi concepts are almost childishly simple, but this is in fact a commendable approach. It doesn't try to thoroughly explain the mechanisms of its world through info-dumps and rather chooses to show the viewer how the devices of the world work. To maintain the wonder of the concepts themselves, the series doesn't mechanics that don't need to be explained. From individuals removing chips and transferring someone into another body to scanning one's memory with a device and jumping into his/her mind to teleporting from room to room by stepping on a floating sphere, we get to witness all of its sci-fi concepts in action. We're shown this all naturally through the actions of Kaiba's characters without taking time to spoon-feed the reader all the information, thus enhancing the experience.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the moment the main character begins exploring the world, the series establishes how the world shapes the mentality of its inhabitants. We see the despair of a family trapped within a cube, unable to experience the world with a real body. We notice attempts to limit the number of people who can inhabit an area with a body for pragmatism. We see a woman striving to escape her current life after winning a new body. Small touches of visual storytelling such as a man's failure at pretending to be a child's brother in order to obtain a body and his cover being blown when thanking the wrong child are well appreciated and serve as natural means of showcasing the deceit that can be present in such a world. Kaiba is the type of series to not hold back on harsh realities. Rather than present a childlike idealistic notion of a world in which memories are fickle and bodies can be manipulated, it depicts the class struggle that would naturally exist in such a world. The rich prosper and live on with near endless potential in what they may do with the manipulation of bodies and memory, while the poor struggle to even thrive in a body. An electrolytic cloud was built to separate the poor from the rich, and those in poverty have  resolved to break through the cloud, even when the inevitable result is failing and losing their memories.\\n\\n\r\nWe can further see the tendency  of impulse, deceit, and denial as we embark through Kaiba's world alonside the titular protagonist. The woman whom Popo sends Kaiba on the ship in episode 1 uses Kaiba's body for her own sexual impulses, loading her memory onto Kaiba's body for pleasure. The depiction of this sexual portrayal is gruesome, and some may be deem this event far too excessive for the series, but it demonstrates the lengths that some individuals may take in such a world and thus is a worthwhile inclusion. Butter's using of various women for his smuggling of memories serves to portray more of the deception inherent in such a world. Vanilla maintains order as a sheriff, but we see he's driven more strongly by his lust for a beatiful woman. Through him we further see the rules enforced within such a world, such as copies of individuals having no right to harm their originals and individuals being free to harm copies. Certainly questionable rules, and pragmatism is raised yet again when the copy within Kaiba's body is spared only so  that the body could be sold to the collector Cloak.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 3 further supports the harsh reality of such a world, but it also showcases that there's more to the conflict of characters within this world than mere selfishness. Chroniko's memories being disposed of when selling her body poses the risks and uncertainties that can arise in such a world of deception, but it doesn't depict her aunt Negi  as wholly evil. Negi attempts to convince herself that she's justified in selling Chroniko, providing the excuse that she has provided enough for her and that Chroniko isn't her true daughter. But as she reflects upon what she went through to provide Chroniko her boots and takes joy in remembering playing piano with her, she cannot mask her genuine love for Chroniko, consequently grieving over the decision she had made. Although the characters of Kaiba may be driven through selfish ambitions, they are after all still people, and Negi's conflicts represents what playing with the memory of others can entail. \\n\\n\r\nEpisode 5 serves to showcase the role of consumerism in such a world. Individuals are more focused on what they can attain for accessories rather than what is truly necessary. Through the story of the robot Patch, we see his ambition in righting the wrongs of Alibiba's consumerism desires. Path's inventions were responsible for such excessive consumerism, but he built those inventions out of necessity rather than personal satisfaction. As such, he resolved to sabotage his creations in rebellion. Unfortunately his limited battery prevents him from succeeding in each attempt, and he loses all memory before recharging. As a result, all his attempts to combat the toxic consumerist tendencies of the masses is in vein. And thus we see the struggle of a character seeking to correct the world when in reality he's only admired for the problem he creates.\\n\\n\r\nThrough its episodic format in the first half, the series fleshed out the world through these aforementioned elements but it is also respect-worthy for how it built up its overarching story throughout its episodic format. Episode 1 already showcased Popo's desire to kill Kaiba in front of the skonk, and Hal's role in delivering Hyohyo onto the ship, both central to future reveals. The announcement of Neiro blowing up the memory tanks in episode 2 established the introduction of the Issoudan and suspense over what the relationship between Kaiba and Neiro could be. The end of episode 5 revealed the king of memories warp, leading the viewer to question the significance of Kaiba being given the name warp. Episode 6 established the memory-eating kaiba plant and Kaiba's interactions with Neiro. And episode 7 wrapped up Kaiba's journey with Vanilla, closing the episodic half of the series. Although the focuses shifted throughout the episodic portions, the series maintained a sense of continuity. For example, Kaiba and Vanilla being chased after in episode 7 was directly due to their involvement with Neiro. \\n\\n\r\nWith sufficient setup from these episodes, the series focused on its more ambitious central story. The Issoudan's movement to oppose all manipulation of memories was established more thoroughly, Kaiba and Neiro's past together was revealed, and motivations were provided for all of Kaiba's characters. This focused story of Kaiba was surely ambitious, but it also resulted in the majority of the issues with the show's execution. Firstly, Kichi receiving Kaiba's memories after Vanilla's memory transfer was contrived, as the series didn't provide a good enough reason why that location was chosen. Furthermore, although Popo's motivations and hypocrisy in disobeying the rules of Issoudan were understandable, several of his decisions were questionable: from  not disposing of Kaiba when he and Neiro fell from the castle to his attempts at getting Kaiba and Neiro to go against each other, rather than ridding Kaiba himself. Popo's ideals of instrumentality (of unifying everyone into a single existence) before being betrayed seemed to come out of nowhere without enough a sufficient basis. Even worse was the barrage of betrayals that occurred in episode 11, which also raised the question of how Mantle and the fake warp survived up to that point, as that wasn't explained well enough. Kichi's love for Hyohyo and Sate's desire to follow Popo faithfully until the latter's instrumentality plan needed to be contextualized better.  Fortunately, the ending at the very least handled the relationship between Kaiba and Neiro well, suggesting the importance of connection beyond class divide. Their interactions in both the light-hearted and serious moments were well done, and Neiro was integral in Kaiba's growth from a tyrant focused solely on executing others. Neiro's motivating of Kaiba and her influence as his driving force were necessary for Kaiba's ability to resolve the conflict with the kaiba plant and establish a conclusion in which the connections between individuals was stronger. Despite this, the presence of the kaiba plant at the end seemed far too rushed, and the appearance of another warp at the end wasn't explained properly. The role of the revolving fans also weren't as prominent as they could have been, merely thrown in at the end and taken care of immediately. \\n\\n\r\nKaiba also had one partciualar lacking character arc. Primarily, Vanilla lacked enough characterization for his sacrifice to have weight  as he was portrayed almost solely through physical attraction to Chroniko. Thankfully, such physical impulse is consistent with Kaiba's theme pertaining to the value of the body, but Vanilla being portrayed almost primarily by this hindered the investment that his sacrifice required. Perhaps if his character traits such as his desire to bring back his mother were established earlier on and further traits were added  to present him as a more fleshed out character, his fate would have had more impact. \\n\\n\r\nFrom this we can see a handful of issues with Kaiba's execution. Nonetheless, its ambition mostly made up for it. How it presented its world visually was impressive, and although it had issues with its story, it performed a commendable job given how ambitious it was for the run-time. It would also be an injustice to not mention how strong the series was audio-visually. Kaiba's art was vibrant and distinct compared to most anime, and it featured a strong soundtrack for both the more light-hearted and the more melancholic moments. The character designs were simple yet still expressive, varied, and effective. The series even made use of shortcomings in its art/animation as the lower budget episode 5 integrated the drop in art quality into its story of consumerism and the desire for the artificial. Kaiba definitely uses its audiovisuals for full capacity and probably couldn't work as well in any other storytelling medium.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: (Personal Rating\u2014Fairly Good)\\n\\n\r\nIt's no surprise Kaiba is one of the quintessential artsy anime in the medium. It's highly experimental and ambitious in its approach, and although it does falter in the execution of its story, what it accomplishes is more than enough for it to be a worthwhile series. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Short version:\r\nStory (9/10) - Wonderful setting and good world building, intricate plot and strong mystery factor. First few episodes can be off-putting.\r\nCharacters (7/10) - Bland main character, very strong supporting cast.\r\nAnimation and Art (7/10) - Good use of a unique bubbly artstyle, inconsistent backgrounds.\r\nSoundtracks (9/10) - Beautiful BGM that amplifies every scene's emotions, good vocals.\r\nEnjoyment (8/10) - First 2 episodes were full of confusion, but everything starts to clear up and the story becomes engaging. \r\nOverall (8/10) - A story with a strong message that uses a unique style of presentation in a good way.\r\nLong version:\r\nMemories are one of the few things in our worldthat are invaluable. Rich or poor, strong or weak, we all have memories exclusive to us. It is these memories that make us who we are and molds our persona. Without our memories, we are nothing but a shell of our genuine self. Kaiba is set in a world where memories are given physical form. They are bought, sold, stolen or even eaten like food. It tells a story of love in a cruel dystopia and it does it superbly.\\n\\n\r\nThe story starts off rather confusing. We are shown, Kaiba, our main character waking up in the middle in of a ravaged village with no recollection of his memories. The first episode leaves you with a huge amount of questions which acts as a great hook as it would pique your interest with a strong mystery factor. However this can also be a double edged sword as people who are looking for straight forward narratives can be put off with the huge confusion. By the end, most of these questions are answered either by ambiguous or clear ways. The first half of the anime consists mainly of episodic stories of different characters Kaiba meets across space. These episodes do a sublime job of showcasing the diabolical setting through the tragic tales of different people across the universe that emotionally immerse the viewer. The second half of the anime addresses the main narrative which revolves around Kaiba's lost memories. This half is filled with unexpected plot twists, intense conflicts and endearing romance.\\n\\n\r\nSince he has no memories, the main character doesn't have much of a personality at the start. He is usually listening to other characters talking to him for the majority of the time. He doesn't show anything that makes him distinct or enable you to relate to him which makes him dull for the most part. Although that can be excused as a plot factor, it still makes it harder for the viewer to relate to Kaiba. This becomes less of a problem later on because Kaiba undergoes some development in the second half as he regains his memories but he stills remains slightly dull without much of a personality, acting mostly as a plot device. The supporting characters is rich and most of the characters are memorable. Some characters experience substantial development over the course of merely 3 episodes while others leave a strong emotional impact on you in just one. Since memories are given physical forms. the show easily portrays the characters' feelings and emotions in enthralling ways. The female heroine experiences internal conflict that is well presented and the motives of some of the characters are made believable due to the conditions of their upbringing.\\n\\n\r\nThe most distinct feature of Kaiba is its cartoonish art-style which gives characters an innocent look that acts as a profound contrast to the cruel world they live in. Despite the characters being well drawn with attention to detail, the backgrounds suffered from large inconsistencies to the point where it was difficult to tell what was being shown. The animation was smooth for the most part and suffered from insignificant faults. The beauty and fluidity were most noticeable during action scenes in the last few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nKaiba's soundtrack is one of the best I heard. Not only is it mesmerizing on its own, but each track played was depicting the scene being shown. It made the sad scenes tragic, the happy scenes joyful and the tense scenes intense. The overall tone of the show is sad and naturally the same goes for the soundtrack. Some of the OST uses vocals that provide more emotional depth and meaning to the music. I wasn't very impressed by the OP and ED during my first listen; but as I watched more of the anime and comprehended the messages of the narrative, I took meaning to the lyrics of these songs and they grew on me.\\n\\n\r\nEven though the first 2 episodes didn't pull me in, the rest of the anime was a marvelous journey. The episodic stories during the first half are indelible pieces of suffering. Only to be followed by a roller coaster of revelations and plot twists that kept me on the edge of my seat.\\n\\n\r\nKaiba is great. The concept of memories is used in many narratives but rarely does it succeed like it did in Kaiba. In 12 episodes, it managed to tell an emotionally impactful story about love and memories in an unfair world. It was an innovative experience that won't be forgotten. It is a great addition to my memories. It is a great addition to me. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThank you for taking the time to read.",

            "content": "Kaiba is an experimental anime best known as being the brainchild of Yuasa Masaaki, who would later go on to direct The Tatami Galaxy and Ping Pong the Animation, two of the greatest works of the current decade of anime thus far. And Kaiba is undeniably in the same vein of brilliance as his later works. However, as impressive as Kaiba is, it's not as good as Tatami or Ping Pong - which is regrettable, because by all accounts it should have been just as exceptional as these two - if not better.\r\nI mean, it was certainly more amibitious than either of them, and thosetwo were plenty ambitious as it is. Where Tatami and Ping Pong were both highly eccentric coming-of-age stories, Kaiba is a highly eccentric dystopian high-concept sci-fi, revolving around the concept of a fictional universe in which memories are tangible, modifiable, and transferrable.\\n\\n\r\nThe first thing you'll notice about Kaiba is that it is visually stunning. This extends far past the surrealistically cutesy character designs and bizarre environments - the animation is tremendously fluid, the visual design is a thing of awe, and the impressive and elaborate set-pieces are a great example of Masaaki's incredible talent as a director.\\n\\n\r\nThe design isn't just a shallow aesthetic choice, either. The cutesy designs are a stark contrast to the dystopian setting, making the graphic nature of this series far more unsettling than it would have been given a more conventional presentation. The music is similar, in that it is a mix of creepiness and childlike innocence. The bizarre technology is a great part of Kaiba's aesthetic as well, with the vehicles, weaponry, and memory technology bearing a creative design that comes off as both high-conccept and cutesy at once.\\n\\n\r\nThe early episodes are the series' strongest, each of them an episodic vignette about the planet the episode is set on. These build excellent short stories that not only make for great worldbuilding, fleshing out a well-realized setting in which human lives are cheap and where memories are a commodity, but also create the kind of ethereal, atmospheric dreamscapes out of the setting that you can really lose yourself in.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem with Kaiba arises when it becomes plot-driven in the latter half. While the core of it - a central character conflict between our three leads, Kaiba, Neiro, and Poppo - is very strong, it gets lost in a larger entanglement of numerous subplots revolving around minor characters that become impressively convoluted in a short span of time. There are an absurd number of twists regarding the identities and goals of characters before the plot even has time to make us invested in them. The viewer never has a chance to be grounded in what they are supposed to believe - it's hard to be surprised by a twist about a character you never knew from the start, and harder yet to understand why any character does what they do when their supposed motives and alliegiances will shift at the drop of a hat.\\n\\n\r\nBut for a series with such a poorly-executed plot (and do keep in mind, this would be the death of almost any lesser series), Kaiba remains a remarkably impressive piece of work. The concept is brilliantly utilized, the setting is both engaging and entrancing, and the presentation is damn near peerless - perhaps rivalled only by Masaaki's later work. There's also some surprisingly strong characterisation in play here... not for the titular character, though, who is mostly a blank slate (which, to be fair, is used to great effect in the early episodes), but for Poppo, who is perhaps the only good example of a shift in motives in this series (and there are many). To elaborate too much on this would be to ruin it, but I will say that there's a certain scene in his backstory that evolves as the plot progresses, and this is combined with certain plot devices in a clever way that shows Masaaki's directing as nothing short of masterful.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Words: Kaiba really is a unique, impressive series, and I'd highly recommend it. But it is frustrating that it didn't live up to its full potential - perhaps if it were longer, it would have been able to fully flesh out its plot.\\n\\n\r\nStory/Plot: 4/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\r\nAnimation/Art: 10/10\\n\r\nMusic: 10/10\\n\r\nActing: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nFor Fans Of: Angel's Egg, The Tatami Galaxy",

            "content": "One of the most distressing things about some anime is their inability to use to its fullest potential many of the interesting ideas that they come up with. Some get bogged down in trying to appeal to as many people as possible or by just abandoning originality in favour of playing it safe by ripping off other successful shows and characters. But with Kaiba its a little different,  the show had some interesting original ideas, art and characters and was definitely not try to appeal to a mainstream audience but it too failed to reach its full potential and become some thing truly greatbut it was for a number of different reasons than what happens to most other anime, but I'll get into that later... \\n\\n\r\nThe basic premise of Kaiba is the story of a young boy who wakes up possessing no memories, and his only possession is a locket with a picture of a girl, and a hole in his chest. He then goes on a journey throughout the highly sensationalised and Dr Seuss style world of this anime while diving into a complex look at human nature, class warfare and the dangers of technology.\\n\\n\r\nNow to start off I would like to say that one of the reasons I enjoyed Kaiba was because it was not afraid to take risks, so many anime these days are terrified to do anything different with their art or story that we end up with generic rip off's and so many anime`s set in schools and rom-coms that its gotten ridiculous . While not revolutionary this anime did take some big risks at a time when studio companies are only concerned with one word \u201cmoe\u201d and for that I was very grateful and pleased to see that originality still exists.\\n\\n\r\nThe story in Kaiba while interesting, is probably its biggest flaw, not because it\u2019s a bad story, not at all, in fact some of the ideas are very interesting to watch and think about. such as the idea of memory chips which can store people memory's and allow the switching of bodies, this has led to a way to cheat death and allow people (who can afford it) to get their dream bodies. But as with anything new and revolutionary it has its dark side, with people being forced to sell their bodies (literally) for money and even body stealing and collecting. Really at its core that\u2019s what this anime is really about, showing us the dark side of human nature and the horrible things we\u2019re capable of. But this is where the problems come in, while kaiba has some interesting ideas their not developed enough for us to become enthralled with them and most importantly they are not explained enough, so let me explain...\\n\\n\r\nNow id like to think of myself as someone with at least average intelligence and I don't need every little thing explained to me, in fact it can be more interesting when you have to use your imagination to fill in the blanks, but for fucks sake nothing was explained or made any sense in this anime. To be truthful it felt like the makers said \u201cokay lets create a really trippy world that will show people the evils of human nature and will make them think while tugging at their emotions\u201d and they did this really well, but then tacked on a half backed plot with some under developed characters at the end without much thought or real effort, the truth is this story and characters felt rushed and not thought out probably because it was rushed and not thought out. Had Kaiba been just an exploration of the world, rather than focusing so much on the plot in the second half then this series could have been a real gem to watch. Its possible to create an anime that just focuses on the spectacle rather than the characters or story and when you do something like that then its okay if a lot of things are left unexplained because we are just along for the ride but when you try to tell a complicated story and give characters some real depth then you have to at least get the basics straight other wise we cant get invested or relate to the characters because nothing makes sense. This is the main reason Kaiba failed to acheive its full potential, because time has taught us again and again that no amount of visuals, special effects or cool characters can replace a good, intersting, logical story ( take the hint Micheal Bay!) and without this everything is just wasted because a story brings together all the other elements. \"A special effect is just a tool, a means of telling a story, a special effect without a story is a pretty boring thing.\"-George Lucas. (before he became a sell out.) \\n\\n\r\nAnyway enough with the story the next thing to mention is the art. To say how good the art is feels a bit like flogging a dead horse at this point but to sum up what everyone has said is that its fantastic, very sensationalised and defiantly the strongest point of this show. But to say one thing that not many people mention is how the art is very clearly influenced by other materials from western animation and older shows rather than just coping the contemporary anime art styles, this was a nice touch and help give the show a fell of originality. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound in Kaiba is perfect for what the show is trying to do, for the most part its subdued and kept in the background allowing us to feel what's happening without being to much in your face and manipulating. It not particlarly memorable but it certainly better than average and like the art seems to draw on a larger field of influence than most other animes. One thing that I noticed was that the music seemed to be very similar too or at least influenced by an old game called the Neverhood which I noticed a lot of this series seems to have drawn influence from. \\n\\n\r\nTo conclude I would say that Kaiba is a perfect example of wasted potential and another chapter in the \u201cwhat could have been great\u201d book that the anime industry is currently writing. But even so I cant stress enough that this review is not a negative one, I just wanted to point out some of the problems to allow people to understand why a good series like this fails to achieve the level of greatness that it could have. Overall this series is a very good and interesting one that sucks you in and never lets go and you certainly wont forget about it for a very long time. While it didn't reach the heights it could have, Kaiba is still a welcome relief from the usual direction anime has been heading in for the past few years and is a must see for anyone looking for something a little different.",

            "content": "What is a human being? It's a collaboration of memories. Memories of yourself and memories of how others see you. When you destroy or change either of the aspects - the whole being changes.\r\nKaiba is a story about memories, about memories that were lost, memories that were changed. About how good and bad memories are of equal importance.\r\nHumans strive to find a way to forget. Forget all the bad memories and leave the goods ones. But if we forget, doesn't it makes us less of what we are? Without bad experience we wouldn't be the same person.\r\nThe world of Kaiba is one of dystopia. Thepoverty strikes harshly against the wealthiness. In this world the memories can be moved around. Deleted, copied, sold and bought. As well as bodies that lost all their memories. The rich ones may live forever by storing their memories in an expensive chip and moving it between bodies, while the poor ones either sell their memories or bodies for a hope of better tomorrow.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is... strange, to say the least. It's a minimalistic caricature in every aspects, from the character design to the world. It took me six episodes to finally get a grip on it and understand small aspects.\\n\r\nThe sound is great, the melodies are lovely and they kick in just in the right time to get you pumped or to crush your heart.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has no mercy. On several occasions it crushed my souls with how ruthless it is. There's no forgiveness. It took me by my heart and didn't let go until the last credits passed.\\n\\n\r\nIt's one of the six titles out of almost three hundred watched that received a score of 10 from me. I always try very hard to evaluate the experience I gained with each title and the very last condition after getting a 9 is to have an ending that I liked. This one managed it, to my happiness.",

            "content": "Ah, first review, here we come! (There might be a few spoilers)\r\nKaiba is not your typical anime. From the unorthodox way of animation, to the strange, confusing (but brilliant) storyline, it breaks the mold for anime you'd probably typically watch. There are virtually no characters that fall into the groups of typical anime stereotypes (yandere, tsundere) and the anime introduces interesting sci-fi concepts that we probably could never imagine ourselves, which brings out the amazing originality of this piece of art (I mean anime).\r\nKaiba's basic storyline starts off in a world where memories can be manipulated and swapped and bodies can be interchangeable, meaning youcan freely delete bad memories and replace them with good ones, and implant them into another body. We find the main protagonist (Kaiba) inside a crumbling white room, with no memory of who he is or why he is there. Before he can ask any of these questions, he finds himself being chased by what seemed to be an over sized hairdryer. After narrowly escaping it, he embarks on the journey to regain his memories, traveling from many planets and meeting many people along the way.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\r\nThe story was brilliantly laid out. From the beginning to the end, it Kaiba kept me hooked to my computer screen. The paciing was to the point of near perfection, letting us sympathize with Kaiba, while letting us view and immerse ourselves in his futuristic world. Bits of the plot are leaked out slowly, making you wonder what is happening and why, driving you to finish the series. Eventually though, all these pieces of the plot you'll find can interconnect, and the true brilliance of\\n\r\nthe story is revealed.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nIt's like something out of a Salvador Dalli painting. The background environment is amazing and complex, with very interesting depictions of strange animals and fiery suns. Nearly everything is coloured for its situation, with poor places painted very dully and plain, whereas aquatic theme parks are bright with many hues of blue and yellow. The characters design, though different from what I'd regularly see out of an anime, was still pleasing to the eye, as the characters seemed to be drawn more circularly. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe OP and ED were very memorable (if not engrishy). Most of the background music enhanced the environment, and basically emulated the senses. Overall, the sound was very well done.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\nThis is probably the best part of this anime. All the characters have diverse personalities and goals, which gives each of them a strong sense of individuality.\\n\r\nSometimes, you'll have some misconceptions of some characters, take Popo. You first find him aiding Kaiba to the spaceship, giving him the sense that he is an ally. Then we find he is a member of the Issoudan, a group to kill the king of memories (really Kaiba, but Warp occupies the throne). Here we find he has traits of an arrogant and bloodthirsty antagonist, with no mercy to Kaiba/Warp or anyone who betrays the Issoudan. We only find in the  latter episodes his real intention in to find a body for the memories of his mother,  giving him sympathy and reasoning for his actions., putting him back in to his neutral stance, and renewing some sympathy for him.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it was an awesome ride. and I recommend you watch it. Now.\\n",

Actually it is a rather depressing and bleak look at human nature and mortality or at least it has been early on.  The watcher gets the sense that at any moment the tide could change and there will be light around the next bend.  The story is very unique and will rank high among most anime if people can go past the artwork to try the show out and if the story does not take a downward spiral from here.  Anyway, if you are wondering whether you shouldtry out this anime, seriously give it a shot and watch the first episode you will be intrigued.  But let me give this warning: if you don't like being semi-depressed; avoid it.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is really not that bad in an artistic sense.  Actually, one could make the argument that this show could not work without this specific cartoon feel.  But one could also say that it is rather simplistic and bland.  So I gave it a 6.  I may revise that later.  Actually sense this is an early review; I will likely revise the whole thing later.",

            "content": "Omikron: The Nomad Soul was a game for PS2 and PC made by David Cage. It was a half-magical, half-science fiction bodyswapping adventure that featured terrible shooting segments, a confusing story, and a main character who jumped from body to body with maniacal disregard for the life and personhood of those effected. David Bowie wasn't enough to save Omikron from being a dumpster fire.\r\nKaiba, on the other hand, is all of the above done exceptionally right. Kaiba takes place in a world where bodies and memories are commodities to be bought and sold, altered and copied. Instead of creating a utopia, this leads to ahighly stratified society where the caste of the exceptionally rich are the singular beneficiaries. The two major factions, in broad enough terms to avoid spoiling them, are a terrorist organization who fights for the sanctity of the lives of individuals and a government headed by a god-king built around the technology of body and memory transposition.\\n\\n\r\nWhere Kaiba really shines is driving home the kind of existential horror the world it takes place in makes prolific. It doesn't feel like the writers do this simply to be mean-spirited or to pull a 'gotchya' moment on the viewer, but even weeks after having finished it I'll shiver remembering what a character used another's body for or picturing situations where one's beloved memories are sold off to keep a household's finances afloat. Some of these vignettes are the focus of a whole episode, some span the whole series, and an unfortunate few are only a brief side plot. In pretty much every case, though, they are very well handled and make me hungry for more while also dreading how the next perversion of what we understand as identity and personhood will twist up my heart and mind.\\n\\n\r\nKaiba is very distinct artistically on top of all this. Masaaki Yuasa renders the series in a retro-cartoonish style more akin to Astro Boy or even Rubberhose style animation than anything contemporary to it and uses a psychotropic kaleidoscope of a palette. In spite of the simplistic styling, facial fidelity is great and bizarre actions without conceivable metaphors (like literally climbing into someone's psyche) are understood at a glance. There are plenty of bizarre and futuristic appliances in Kaiba and yet they don't seem particularly byzantine or requiring the kind of attention to rationalize them that a more stayed sci-fi universe would necessitate.\\n\\n\r\nIf you havn't watched Kaiba yet, it is seriously a treasure. Bear with the first episode, as it has a pretty cold open on account of an amnesiac protagonist and having such a backlog of concepts to start unravelling. You will be presented with a world both cartoony and cut-throat which, in contemplation, you may find yourself wandering back to in a combination of curiosity and horror.\\n",

            "content": "To be honest, this show wasn't the easiest to get into. If you like light fluffy anime with good humor and no driving theme, this might be a no-no. \r\nWatching Kaiba is like looking at a gallery of abstract paintings. Some things can be confusing until properly understood. The whole story is one long strand of many adventures. I mean, this guy is all over the place. It's like a Greek Epic. Plus, the way it ties in the romantic undertones with Neiro and whatnot? I like that. Along with the many bittersweet moments that accompany conclusion episodes.\r\nThe art style was so different that Iwas just like \"wow\". It's not some grand eye candy or anything, but a lot of animes don't take the risk of using this smoother, \"kiddy\" looking animation. Though sometimes it was like taking a drug trip. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound wasn't really impressive. I guess the OP was okay, that's all I noticed though. The music was just kind of \"there\". Background noise, rather than some emotion driver (check Clannad).\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were good for being as underdeveloped as they were. Hell, Kaiba himself has close to no type of character of his own until the end. He's like Link, if you will. A bit of a \"default\". And with the vast number of side characters, a lot of them could have gotten a lot more depth to them. But the story and whatnot is jam packed so I'll give this some lean way.\\n\\n\r\nIt was very entertaining. Even when it was boring, I enjoyed it a good bit. It was very new and different to me, so I was exhilarated by a lot of things. Even considering how short it is, it has so much put into it to enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give Kaiba a 10/10. Because of how satisfying it was. Even at the end, where a cliffhanger could be interpreted (which definitely wasn't a cliffhanger or anything), I felt a feeling of accomplishment after finishing. I haven't enjoyed an anime in its entirety like this in a while. It was great.",

            "content": "Weird, experimental yet strangely compelling.\r\nPLOT: Highly original plot and setting for this anime. It\u2019s all about the concept of memories and what constitutes an individual. In the world of Kaiba memories can be stored on chips and an individual can implant these memory chips in any body they so wish \u2013 this leads to quite a bit of body swapping over the course of the series which was quite an interesting plot thread. Kaiba isn\u2019t afraid to address quite adult themes and complex ethical issues \u2013 it\u2019s a very interesting if unusual anime. Of course at its core its a mystery anime \u2013 lots offlashbacks and convoluted plotlines that don\u2019t all get resolved at the end as we try to determine who the main character actually is. The ending is actually very chaotic and I\u2019m not entirely sure if I know what happened! The show had quite a slow start while it was introducing the world and letting the viewer get used to the setting, these early episodes were very episodic and hit or miss for me. However once we got to the middle section and got to main meat of the plot the show became quite interesting indeed. Very good storytelling in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION: Hmmm I still think a 6-year-old could produce better character designs. I wasn\u2019t all that fond of the very abstract animation in this show \u2013 however the lack of structure worked well for the concept \u2013 the world is just as fluid and changeable as peoples memories and bodies. Regardless I found it difficult to reconcile the weird childish style and the quite mature, complex subject matter and this hindered my enjoyment quite a bit. Still I appreciate that the creators where attempting to present something new and original.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC & VOICE ACTING: I really liked the OP & ED, both are quite melancholy ballads and fit well with the general tone of the show. The background score was also quite fitting throughout. Great voice cast as well \u2013 made it easier to sympathise with characters that sometimes looked like large multicoloured blobs\\n\\n\r\nOverall an interesting show but fairly difficult to review without getting stuck into the themes the show addresses. It was hard to get into at the beginning but well worth sticking with for its originality and engaging subject matter.",

            "content": "A very unique series but somehow lost its spark in the second half. It's hard to summarize Kaiba into one sentence but it basically tells a tale about one guy trying to retrieve his memories. The first six or seven episodes revolves around him travelling to different planets and meeting different people, all of them are affected by the memory-transfer technology. The concept is nothing original, neither are the plot nor the characters. But the amazing artstyle and the superb director make the first half of Kaiba exceptionally enjoyable. Watch the first episode and you'll know what I'm talking about. I have not seen sucha gorgeous artstyle in years. Absolutely a visual feast. The use of color schemes and camera angles are beyond professional. More importantly, they created a unique AND believable universe which is lacked in most animes.\\n\\n\r\nThe main plot kicks in during the second half, where more of this guy's past is revealed. I'm not sure why but the story suddently becomes less interesting. There are no big plot holes but it does seem inconsistent at times. I think the problem lies in the fact that Kaiba has a superb director but not-so-superb writers, and when they shifts the story from style-driven to character-driven, it just fails miserably. The writers don't know how to set up a conflict, they don't know how to advance the plot, they don't know how to use foreshadowing properly. Worst of all, they don't know how to reveal plot twists. They actually did that by letting the cyborg dude preaching to the female lead. The final relevation is also a &quot;meh&quot; for me.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways watch Kaiba for its visual style but don't expect much from the story.",

            "content": "Kaiba left me very conflicted. On one hand, it's a beautifully animated show, with legitimately interesting characters and an absorbing world concept. On the other, it's a serious mess, with a rushed and barely coherent plot that devalues a significant amount of its strengths. in short, it's a show that will unfortunately never realize its potential.\r\nLet's start with the bad: Kaiba's story is virtually unfollowable, with the first half of the show representing a slow-burning, walkthrough of the world's concepts as our main character tries to survive a dystopia, and the second half is a payoff lightly hinted at beforehand. Its jarring, hard to follow,and relies on a suspension of disbelief, especially as Warp's powers are made clear towards the end. Characters that were forgotten from the first episode are suddenly relevant, and recurring characters are not. This plot is a hot mess, barely understandable.\\n\\n\r\nFrom here you'd probably think I hated this anime, but honestly, the plot is its only real issue. To be fair its a major one, but the art is unique and interesting, the animation is fluid, the characters are believable and worthy of interest, and the show strikes a mature harmony between sound and silence to express its scenes. I watched this immediately following The Tatami Galaxy, hoping for more of the brilliance I found there and was underwhelmed by the story. However, everything else is still there.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, this show feels like it needed at least another 12 episodes. It's a universe with the moral complexity and depth of fullmetal alchemist shoved into 12 episodes, and boy does it show. This doesn't get a 6 because it's a bad show, it just feels woefully incomplete, rushed, and condensed. It has all the pieces to be something potentially great, it just seems it was denied its chance to do so, and will likely never be given another.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime was worth watching, even if it left me deeply unsatisfied in terms of plot. Its art, animation, characters, and world are worth a recommendation alone. Just don't expect much from the story itself.",

Kaiba is the very anime that makes this clear.\r\nKaiba does have the art style of Osamu Tezuka running throughout it, at least to some degree. For some reason, episode 5 decided \"screw that, I'm being abstract!\", and Masaaki Yuasa let it happen.\r\nThe world-building of Kaiba is pretty good, not the best, but it outclasses a lot of series. The characters were ones I never really felt an emotional attachment to, until we neared the endgame and shitgot real. Towards the end, things of an entirely depressing nature start happening. It's not overwhelming by any means, but stiil...damn.\\n\\n\r\nBut I haven't mentioned the best of it yet. The episodes that are stand alone stories are by far Kaiba's true strengths, episodes 5 and 6 being two of the best anime episodes that I've ever come across. The final few episodes seem disjointed and confusing at first, but things do get explained quite clearly soon after.\\n\\n\r\nAs for comparing it to Yuasa's other works, Cat soup and the tatami galaxy are better and should be checked out first. Lu over the wall and other things, you say? Probably reviews for another time.",

Well, because it easily fades behind all the popular anime, which is such a waste.\r\nKaiba was a rollercoaster ride of emotions, which showed the beauty and cruelty in one world. I loved every second of this anime. The mystery, the mature themes, the soundtracks and the characters where amazing. With the end of an episode, I immediately wanted to see the next, hence why I finished it rather quickly. \r\nThe main character is interesting because of his amnesia and the search for who he is and who theperson in the picture is. This is not the reason why I started the anime though. I fell in love with the simplistic yet beautiful looking art style. Besides this, I liked how this world exists of people storing their memories to, well, never die. It shows of course how easy it is for the rich and how hard it is for the poor. \\n\\n\r\nEven the side characters the protagonist meets along his journey are interesting. They give you more inside on the cruelties and beauty of this world. They were not just mere side characters as they give development to the main character. \\n\\n\r\nThe art style should not keep you away from this anime. It\u2019s simplistic, but it fits the story very well. Nothing more to say about it. \\n\\n\r\nJust give this anime a go if you like your psychological stories and anime that differ from the rest. It\u2019s an adventure of emotions, so at least try this anime.\\n",

            "content": "Story: 9/10\r\nStraight from episode 1 it's clear that Madhouse tries to pull off a narrative in a reversed timeline as the first scene shows a strange boy waking up to discover that he has no memories. The setting is that of a future where memories can be transformed into data and transported from different bodies and as the world is explored more thoroughly, we also receive shattered pieces of information about the protagonist. These do little more than confuse you at first but prove to be vital if you want to comprehend the latter part of the show.\r\nPulling off a story with such an unconventionaltimeline takes creativity, but Madhouse is up to the challenge. Amongst the numerous clever plot twists and shocking revelations they bring up several questions of relevance; can the concept of a free will truly exist in a world where memories and one\u2019s physical form is so easy to tamper with? And is a technological advancement that trivializes the vitality of one's memories and the body one was born into, an insult to nature and life itself? Several other issues that become relevant with body-swapping and such are the less pleasant topics of sexuality that happens to be a not precisely prominent but still featured theme. People in the Kaiba universe have been known to download false sexual memories for their own pleasures, as well as create their own collections of mindless children to abuse.\\n\\n\r\nKaiba proves to be an intellectually satisfying ride with an equal ability to confuse and enlighten. Remain concentrated though, and I promise that everything will turn clear when the show is finished!\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nFrom the more experimental depths of studio Madhouse comes a mind-numbingly amazing piece of visual eye-candy that would justify watching Kaiba even if the story was horrendous. Eccentric character designs merge with a world of strange shapes and colors that use the potential of sky-high production values to be about as memorable as the animation in Mononoke. Action scenes are usually impressive, and my only real complaint is that a few episodes (the latter ones in particular) seem to fail in bringing the same visual splendor to the screen as their predecessors.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nIt could be argued that Kaiba's soundtrack is way too minor to fit a story of such extravagance, but just like in Serial Experiments I saw the muted use of music to be both favorable and negative. Most of the scores are memorable and well-made, but there are many emotional key moments that are accompanied with nothing but silence. The emotional punches tend to hit you effectively regardless thanks to excellent scripting and voice acting, but obviously they would have reached even higher levels of impact if they were backed up by some music. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme, as well as the ending theme, is a calm and most fitting song that lays out expectations for the sci-fi love story you're about to see. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, this section is not rated positively due to an abundance of likeable characters. In truth, the individuality in Kaiba is so muted due to the constant swapping of bodies that you might end up perceiving each character as pretty much devoid of any form of personality. What becomes important is thus the way they interact and change over time, and in the end you might discover that they were in fact better than you thought.\\n\\n\r\nWithout resorting to spoilers I might just add that many characters are revealed to hold extremely fundamental secrets related to their actual identities that are exposed later on, but only implied in earlier scenarios. Your personal perception is bound to change over time as you learn new, unpredictable, things about characters that seemed trivial at first. Said unpredictability is most likely one of the key factors to Kaiba\u2019s awesomeness.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nThough-provoking, extremely well structured and filled to the brim with frame after frame of artistic wonder; Kaiba is that rare anime that has shockingly few flaws that you can expose. I also reckon that it's rewatch-friendly as it might be fun to search for details in the storyline when you already know the largest aspects of the world. Warmly recommended anime from a person who rarely likes anything this much!\\n",

It has to be your taste and you must give all of your attention to the plot in order to understand what is happening, otherwise you will get confused no doubt about it.\r\nThe art and atmosphere is surely not something you see in anime often - they are unique and some might think childish. The story and the plot though, bring up really mature topics.\r\nStory : 9\r\nWhat if after you die, your memories can be transferred to a young and lively body and you can live on? Can you imagine whata world where memories and bodies can be changed would look like? What moral issues would be brought about? These are the subjects that this anime deals with. The mc is a boy who has no memories whatsoever and tries to find himself. Along the way he meets many interesting characters and learns about their stories and their valuable memories as well.\\n\\n\r\nArt : 9\\n\r\nChildish and simplistic you say? Well I am so into weird staff like this. \\n\r\nThere are barely any shades and colorings. The lines are apparent and the colors are bright and compact. But man its uniqueness, it really got me. Animation was also outstanding. Movement and voices were well fit, accurate and synchronized.\\n\\n\r\nSound : 10\\n\r\nI usually don't give much attention to the music and sounds of the anime. But this had beautiful pieces and the effects were really something. OT and ET were very well fit with the futuristic theme of the series, and the singer had an eerie yet warm voice. Action scenes and sad moments were nicely accompanied with the appropriate piece. When goofy characters were around, goofy music was present as well (something like the Super Mario for game boy music). The 'Tree song' (or else 'Chronico's melody') still haunts me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 9\\n\r\nCharacter development was another strong part of this anime. The mc is an interesting character with an interesting backstory and so is every character he meets. All of them have an interesting story to tell, which is also really touching (tears came to my eyes quite a few times). There are characters that you like from the beginning, characters not so likeable but their actions at some point surprise you in a good way or their backstories justify them and characters not likeable at all - each of them play a significant part in the story and plot.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 8\\n\r\nIf everything is excellent, why did I give it an 8? (8.5 to be exact)\\n\r\nThe truth is that the plot twists and all those details the viewer has to memorize and absorb are too many. After finishing the series you have many questions about motives and may think that there were many plot holes. The way to solve this is to re-watch either parts or the whole series.\\n\r\nThe series as a whole though is really something that, if you are up to these sort of anime and you have an outstanding attention span, is worth a shot. After you have sort most of the plot out, it will be one of your favourites.\\n\\n\r\nNOTE: There are some 'mature' scenes, too, so you better be sure that you are alone in the room with no parents around, in order to not find yourself in an awkward position.",

            "content": "-Note: English is not my native language, I apologize for possible mistakes. (Review in English and Spanish)\r\nKaiba is a science fiction, cyberpunk and love story that takes place in a world where the digitalization of memory has made physical death obsolete. A world where the memories of people can be transferred, copied, stolen, changed to another body or the it.\r\nThe simple premise of the series invites you to want to look at it, it is a very interesting story and premise located in a dystopian futuristic world where the importance of human life was reduced to nothing less than simple merchandise, in this case mainlyits memories where people who have enough money can choose what body to have and even choose to have only good memories, on the other hand they show us how society has been divided as always between the gap between rich and poor, even the latter even have to sell their body by removing their memory, so that their family can move forward or the most unfortunate are even deprived of their lives, being hunted and taken their bodies by force. We can observe an almost complete dehumanization in several moral values \u200b\u200bthat we can now have.\\n\\n\r\nThe series poses an interesting question Is memory the soul? How important is the body? The series could be a critique or mention of the transhumanist future that we could really have just around the corner.\\n\\n\r\nIn this world where the body, memory and human life is discarded without remorse, curiously we have our protagonist, a young man in search of knowing who is and of his own memories. Kaiba wakes up without knowing anything and without knowing where he is, with a strange hole in his chest and with a pendant that has a picture of a girl, which surely is someone important to him.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation or art is peculiar, I think that many could consider it \"childish\" or something \"cartoon\" to the animation at first sight, and with the fact that the series starts with many questions and almost no answer, can make many people decide to leave it. However, although his art can be seen as if it were a children's series, this is a story that has nothing childish and that already makes it clear to you already in the second chapter, quickly you adapt to the style of the series and you enter complemente in the story, personally the animation ended up charming me.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the first chapters can be considered episodic, they serve to show and better understand the world in which they live, showing us stories that leave more than one person with a broken heart and with much sadness (do not expect a happy story) ... I must say that I did not expect the series to show us characters in a single chapter and develop them in such a way that you can feel a lot of emotions at the end of their participation.\\n\\n\r\nAt the same time they show us characters that at first you may not like them and in the end they end up pleasing you and you end up wishing the best for them or vice versa. Special mention to the characters of Chroniko and Vanilla, I loved them.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST is acceptable, the melancholic melodies are well placed at the right moments, my favorite OST of the series is Melody of Chroniko, and its OP and ED, above all its OP \"Never\" by Seira; It gives you a feeling of sadness and feeling, very good song.\\n\\n\r\nFinally a highly recommended series that should not be judged only by its cover or by its style of art, which would suggest to anyone who enjoys anime and want to see something a little different, this story leaves you a lot of philosophical and critical content. Without a doubt it is a series that deserves to be seen more than once, since there are several new things that you could find with more re-watched.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------Espa\u00f1ol/Spanish--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nKaiba es una historia de ciencia ficci\u00f3n, cyberpunk y de amor, que tiene lugar en un mundo donde la digitalizaci\u00f3n de la memoria ha vuelto obsoleta la muerte f\u00edsica. Un mundo donde las memorias de las personas pueden ser transferidas, copiadas, robadas, cambiadas a otro cuerpo o al mismo. \\n\\n\r\nLa simple premisa de la serie te invita a querer mirarla, es una historia y premisa m\u00e1s que interesante ubicada en un mundo futurista distopico donde la importancia de la vida humana fue reducida a nada menos que simple mercanc\u00eda, en este caso principalmente sus recuerdos donde las personas que tengan el dinero suficiente pueden elegir qu\u00e9 cuerpo tener e incluso elegir tener solo recuerdos buenos, por otra parte nos muestran como la sociedad se ha dividido como siempre entre la brecha de ricos y pobres, siendo que estos \u00faltimos incluso tengan que vender su cuerpo al quitarse su memoria, para que su familia pueda salir adelante o los m\u00e1s desafortunados incluso son privados de su vida, al ser cazados y tomados sus cuerpos a la fuerza. Podemos observar una deshumanizaci\u00f3n casi completa en varios valores morales que ahora podemos tener. \\n\\n\r\nLa serie te plantea una pregunta interesante  \u00bfEs la memoria el alma? \u00bfQu\u00e9 tan importante es el cuerpo? La serie podr\u00eda ser una cr\u00edtica o menci\u00f3n al futuro transhumanista que realmente podr\u00edamos tener a la vuelta de la esquina.\\n\\n\r\nEn este mundo donde el cuerpo, la memoria y la vida humana es desechada sin remordimientos, curiosamente tenemos a nuestro protagonista, un joven en busca de quien es y de sus propios recuerdos. Kaiba despierta sin saber nada y sin saber d\u00f3nde est\u00e1, con un extra\u00f1o agujero en su pecho y con un colgante que tiene la foto de una chica, que seguramente se trata de alguien importante para \u00e9l. \\n\\n\r\nLa animaci\u00f3n o arte es peculiar, creo que muchos podr\u00edan considerarlo \u201cinfantil\u201d o algo \u201ccartoonesca/caricaturizada\u201d a la animaci\u00f3n en primera vista, y con el hecho que la serie comienza con muchas preguntas y casi ninguna respuesta, pueda hacer que muchas personas decidan dejarla. Sin embargo  aunque su arte pueda verse como si de una serie infantil se tratara, esta es una historia que no tiene nada de infantil y te lo deja claro ya en el segundo cap\u00edtulo, r\u00e1pidamente te adaptas al estilo de la serie y te adentras complemente en la historia, personalmente la animaci\u00f3n me termino encantando.\\n\\n\r\nSi bien los primeros cap\u00edtulos pueden considerarse epis\u00f3dicos, estos sirven para mostrar y entender mejor el mundo en el que se vive, mostr\u00e1ndonos historias que a m\u00e1s de una persona los dejara con el coraz\u00f3n roto y con mucha tristeza (no te esperes una historia feliz)\u2026.debo decir que no me esperaba que la serie nos mostrara personajes en un solo capitulo y los desarrollaran de tal manera en la que puedas sentir un mont\u00f3n de emociones al finalizar su participaci\u00f3n.  \\n\\n\r\nAl mismo tiempo nos muestran personajes que en un principio pueda que no te agraden y al final te terminan agradando y terminas deseando lo mejor para ellos o viceversa. Especial menci\u00f3n a los personajes de Chroniko y Vanilla, me encantaron.\\n\\n\r\nLa OST est\u00e1 aceptable, est\u00e1 bien puesta las melod\u00edas melanc\u00f3licas en los momentos adecuados, mi favorita OST de la serie es Melody of Chroniko, y su OP y ED, sobretodo su OP \"Never\" by Seira; te da una sensaci\u00f3n de tristeza y sentimiento, muy buena canci\u00f3n. \\n\\n\r\nEn general una serie muy recomendable que no debe juzgarse solo por su portada o por su estilo de arte, a la cual le sugiriera a cualquiera que disfrute del anime y quiera verse algo un poco diferente, esta historia te deja mucho contenido filos\u00f3fico y cr\u00edtico. Sin duda es una serie que merece ser vista m\u00e1s de una vez, ya que hay varias cosas nuevas que podr\u00edas encontrar con m\u00e1s re-watched. \\n\\n\r\nCalificaci\u00f3n: 9/10\\n\\n\\n",

However i have to say that i found it very hard for someone to follow the story due to scenes that are somehow really random and that makes the whole plot really complex.\\n\r\nAs a viewer i felt like i was bombarded with meaningless scenes and random, useless characters that would take insignificant part in the plot of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnother negative characteristic of the series (if we can call it negative) concerns the hero of the series it self. Actually i never figured out who is the main character of this anime.

            "content": "Kaiba is probably one of the most innovative anime out there when it comes to all facets of judgement, be it story, art, sound or character. It is a prime example of why we turn to anime for a different outlook on any topic which can never be found in mainstream television. While Kaiba portrays a sort of dystopic setting in which memories can be transferred between individuals, the manner in which the adventures of the protagonist (who suffers from partial memory loss) play out keeps you ever so involved in the plot. It manages to actually portray significantly mature topics in a simple andcandid manner with a pace and efficiency borderlining masterpiece. The only downside I feel is that the ending was a bit rushed, which is unfortunately characteristic to a lot of anime these days. In conclusion, I would say that its definitely worth a watch since it achieves the objective of making the viewer think on the importance of memories, relationships and responsibility in a very realistic and simple manner.",

The story is very well made and you won't understand what the anime is about at first but slowly it will mold together as you continue watching. For me, I'm usually very picky about the art style of the anime, but I decided to give this anime a try, and it was worth the while. For the basic concept of the anime it's about a boy who wakes up with no memories in a world where people's souls can be transferred into a different body. \r\nSound,lovely music and voice acting. Nothing much to say.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters each have their own story and you can feel for each of them. None of the characters are really detestable because the anime takes each character and makes you sympathize with them. They all have a complex background. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I enjoyed this a lot. The animations were vivid and the characters felt very real. I wish they added more detail on some parts of the story that were left continued. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: I recommend you to watch this if you like sci-fi, body-switching, and space-magic stuff.

            "content": "It seems like each director has a moment where they strike gold, where all the planets and stars align and their style is brought to its fullest potential, making something truly noteworthy. Although I liked Yuasa's later works like Tatami Galaxy and Ping Pong, Kaiba for me feels like that moment where Masaaki Yuasa struck gold, and I hope to explain why:\r\nFirst and foremost, Kaiba, unlike Tatami Galaxy and Ping Pong is an anime original. Usually an anime being adapted or not has little bearing on its quality, but in the case of Kaiba I feel as though being an anime original was of greatbenefit - it allowed Yuasa and the other staff to craft a setting, conflict and characters that is built around Yuasa's surreal and strange style of presentation from the ground up, as opposed to shoehorning a surreal style into a story that doesn't really need it.\\n\\n\r\nKaiba has an artstyle that could simply be described as \"like a 50's cartoon, but more surreal. A LOT more surreal\". This means it has distinct and round bodies for the characters, lots of use of colour, and a deceptively cutesy look - this fits the setting of Kaiba very well, as Kaiba takes place in a dystopian cyberpunk world where none of our cultural and moral principles apply, and where bodies and memories are reduced into a commodity to be traded and sold. The artstyle goes a long way to make this setting into something that feels truly alien and interesting to look at. It also helps that the production values are on the whole pretty good as well, with some well-animated shots for the action sequences and such. It's not just visually interesting from an aesthetic standpoint, but a technical standpoint as well. That said, it can still look weird for the sake of being weird sometimes, but it avoids this problem better than Yuasa's other works.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Kaiba is an interesting one - although it is a cyberpunk anime by definition (it has the \"high-tech, low-life\" aspect down, themes relating to the nature of the body and soul, and a conflict against the establishment in the setting), it feels unique from most cyberpunk media, and not just because of its surreal presentation.\\n\\n\r\nKaiba is not just a cyberpunk anime, but also a romance, the romance is not just a subplot, the romance aspect is the context in which the cyberpunk setting is explored, and in general the progression of the show is separated into two main arcs: The first 7 episodes, which center around the protagonist escaping from law enforcement as a stowaway on the spaceship Synapse Narc, visiting different planets along the way, and episodes 8-12, which focus on the main conflict in the setting and the buildup of the romance between the protagonist and the love interest, showing how the transfer and modification of memories gets in the way of their love.\\n\\n\r\nThe first half is largely episodic, and focuses on worldbuilding. From the first episode the viewer is thrown knee-deep into the setting, as it shows many different family and societal circumstances in just the first 10 minutes alone. This is some excellent worldbuilding, and is not to be overlooked. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately the transition between these two arcs is not as smooth as it could have been. The latter arc takes place on only a single planet in a setting much larger than this, meaning that the first arc, and its characters exist in a void away from the second arc to a large extent. Although the transition is not too jarring - it establishes the romance well before the end of the first arc, the character arcs such as those of Vanilla and Chroniko feel like they are thrown under the rug, and could have been more satisfying than they were. It helps that the second arc is an engrossing morally grey conflict exploring themes such as betrayal, desire and the overall desire for power and looking down on others, but if it was rewritten to include the progression of the first arc some more it could have been even more engaging.\\n\\n\r\nThis also shows somewhat in the soundtrack - although the soundtrack is excellent, having a good mix of cyberpunk adrenaline-inducing chase music with thick percussion and more sentimental themes, with a great OP and ED that do really well in setting the scene and tone of the show, certain elements felt overlooked. For example, the piano song played by Chroniko's mother in episode 3 is used in the later episodes, which felt out of place considering the song felt unique to Chroniko and her mother's circumstances, and the Abipa party music in episode 5 is used as an action backdrop for some of the combat scenes in episodes 9-12, needless to say, party music doesn't fit action like a glove. The music is very well composed, but the music placement could have been better, perhaps having more songs in the soundtrack could have amended this, but it's a minor issue nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nThe themes of the differences in body and soul have been explored in a wealth of cyberpunk, but few of them manage it as well as Kaiba, and manage to tell an engaging romance plot at the same time. You would be doing a great disservice to dismiss Kaiba on a first glance, it is a well-thought out dystopian fiction that is up there with Ghost in the Shell in terms of sheer cyberpunk goodness, and is especially highly recommended for those who have watched and enjoyed Masaaki Yuasa's later, more popular works. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "What is the value of memories in a world where they could be simply edited, altered, falsified, like an image in Photoshop? This is a question posed by Kaiba that prevails throughout the series. \r\nKaiba's plot mainly revolves around the fact that in the universe it occurs in, memories are tactile, and can be tampered with, deleted, or given to another person. The first half consists of mainly episodic vignettes, each building up the multi-planetary land the story takes place in. Throughout these episodes, our protagonist, Kaiba, visits the local people of these planets, learns about their stories, and observes their struggles, while trying tokeep his skin safe as well. The characters of the day in these episodes, despite often having relatively little screen time, each bloom with emotion and personality. Out of them all, there's bound to one who breaks your heart or puts a smile on your face, even if your aren't the emotional type. If I could have had it my way, Kaiba would have continued using this style of story telling for its whole run, but that's not the case.\\n\r\nIn its second half, Kaiba begins to take on an over arcing plot. This is also the point in the show where its quality of story begins to drop, but not because of the usage of an arc itself. The reason Kaiba's story falls apart in its second half is because it is ridiculously confusing and convoluted. I do not mean that in ways of \"six episodes of the end of Evangelion\" sort of confusing, but confusing enough to make you constantly unable to really have a solid grasp of the story. There IS an actual plot going on, but you'll more than likely have difficulty getting it through a first watch through, and I'd suggest looking up episode summaries of episodes 7-12 just to clarify things for yourself. \\n\r\nNow, however the incomprehensible plot may be, I still recommend watching the last half. Why? Because, Kaiba is simply an incredible experience, and I loved every second of it. The cutesy, retro art style  for the characters coalesces  gorgeously with the surreal and simple design in the backgrounds. The whole world if packed to the brim with some of the most unique machines and creatures you may see. The color has a slightly washed out vibe, making it seem older than it is, contributing to the retro style. The color palette also helps give a soft air of inhumanity to they show and its characters, showing how far the definition of \"life\" has changed with transferable memories. The animation is simply mesmerizing. While it may not have the highest frame rate, the characters often move in a manner so natural, and the machines and creatures move in ways so foreign,it's hard to look away from the odd beauty of it all. \\n\r\nThe soundtrack is similarly excellent. It sounds similarly alien, and fantastical. The op, ed, and \"The Tree Song\" all stand out in particular, due to being preformed in actually pretty decent English, albeit, heavily accented. I must commend them for the effort.\\n\r\nOverall, while Kiaba's plot fails in the second half, I cannot recommend this anime enough. While its art style may turn some off, especially when it juxtaposes against some of the more adult scenes, its animation and sound is a true spectacle. If you're feeling tired of seeing the same tired anime tropes and settings, watch Kaiba. I cannot grantee you'll like it, but I can guarantee it will be an experience you never had before.",

            "content": "Memories are one of the most essential parts that makes us who we are. It\u2019s through memories that we are able to retain what we come to know and experience which gradually develops who we are as a person and continues so until we die. However we can\u2019t always remember everything, and sometimes through circumstances people forgot almost everything I.e. amnesia, or alzheimer's. If we lose some of our memories, do we lose a part of ourselves? Are we no longer the same person we were before? It\u2019s hard to say, but many works have tried to explore such concepts, and one of these worksis Kaiba.\\n\\n\r\nKaiba is a sci-fi anime that right off the bat has an unorthodox look to it as the setting, characters, and color pallet have this rather cartoonish and colorful look to it. The shows surreal look alone gives the anime a unique status outside most of anime. The show not only looks different but it looks good with character designs looking unique from one another as well as visually appealing. The worlds look odd but by the end give off an air of familiarity. The colors are vibrant and clash well with one another which helps with the unique visuals of the show. Even with the unique look it does not hamper the animation in anyway allowing for unique and fluid movement to happen on screen. Overall it\u2019s just great and compliments well with the narrative of the show. \\n\\n\r\nKaiba follows a young man who awakens dazed and confused with no memory of who he is or what is going on, even the viewer doesn\u2019t know other than what he is referred as which is given through exposition at the beginning of each episode. The only thing he has is a pendant on his necklace of a smiling woman. With this as well with the help of some people he is sent on a journey where he encounters new people and experiences new things that even if he regains his memories he wouldn\u2019t be the same as he was before losing them. \\n\\n\r\nThe first handful of episode takes time to explore the world of kaiba that allow it to present the themes and ideas of the show. Despite being Sci-Fi it doesn\u2019t take a technical approach to the technology of the show because it\u2019s used as a vehicle to explore its themes and is able to get away with this due to how it presents all of this. For them all the technology is rather commonplace and is used without much though because they are probably used to them that it\u2019s just normal. It also helps that with it\u2019s surreal look that it\u2019s able to get away with surreal moments such as jumping into people's minds. One of these technologies which is common in Kaiba is a small memory brain chip that works in the same way as a gits cyber brain, except it\u2019s small and looks like a cone, but works almost the same way and allows the characters to switch to different bodies. With this people are allowed to live longer, but it becomes evident that only the rich or those who can pay are able to such a thing. Even worse is that people are able to steal other memories so that they can only have good memories while everyone else is better of a hollow husk of a human. \\n\\n\r\nThis is only a small bit of the first half as it continues and explores more about its themes about memories. The show becomes a roller coaster of emotions that is both pleasing and painful, happy and sad, beautiful but heart wrenching. Of course during all this Kaiba continues on his quest to figure out who he is. Along the way he meets many people while many are given one episode that becomes more than enough to feel empathy and emotional attachment even to the most unlikable character.  \\n\\n\r\nThe story does end up taking a turn during the last \u2153 of the show as the show now has to bring the overarching plot to the forefront which was left in the backdrop for too long as the show used most of it\u2019s time on the first half which was great but honestly was more of a detour. Because of this the last half feels all over the place which left me with a bad taste and had to take another reexamined to understand what occurred. While it did finally make sense the way it was delivered proved to be lacking in the end. Nonetheless the characters were still a strong point of the show and it still had the same heart and genuine feel that the first episodes had even after it felt a bit rushed.\\n\\n\r\nA finally thing worth mentioning is the music of the anime which is just great all around.of course the op and the ed for many anime are good but what many shows lack are a good ost which Kaiba hits out of the ballpark.  The \u201cTree Song\u201d is one of the more prominent songs that is played in different versions each one giving a different vibe and atmosphere to a scene and when finally played one last time reveals the true meaning of the song. Some osts like \u201cplanet\u201d and \u201cHello,Goodbye, My memory\u201d sound more like a circus and joyous. Other osts like \u201cMemories\u201d and \u201cChase To it\u201d are the ones that give the show the more sci-fi feeling during the mysterious, action, or high-tension scenes. Not once has any of these felt out of place, but in fact where spine chillingly good. \\n\\n\r\nOverall while the story wasn\u2019t able to hold out onto the end, the shows production values and great cast of characters were able to support the show",

            "content": "Where body can be changed and memories altered the only genuine thing that's left is love and Kaiba is a love story set in a sci-fi, dystopian world. It is that type of sci-fi I love the most. For me, good sci-fi is more about humans rather than aliens or some space wars and Kaiba thoroughly explores the idea of humanity in its perfectly established world. And that world, thanks to amazing world building, is a successful attempt at combining grim dystopia, fanciful concepts, and the unconditional love. \r\nInteresting setting or concept is only a first step, second would be expanding it and building theworld around it. Fortunately, Kaiba didn't stop at first step and managed to build one of the most interesting worlds I've seen. Amnesiac main character helped in building and they could do it in the easiest way possible with exposition dumps and mindless talking but Kaiba is higher than that. It throws us, viewers, immediately into the action and instead of telling us how everything works it prefers to show us a normal, everyday life of other people, their relationships, and the world's customs. portraying Kaiba as more of an observer than a participant (in the first few episodes) also made it easier to immerse in the story and understand the world. In my opinion, \"show, don't tell\" technique is the superior way of storytelling and Kaiba's world building proves why. \\n\\n\r\nSince I talked about world building I have to stress how well the art style and music fit in the overall mood of the show. By deciding on a fancier and more surreal art style the show draws a contrast with the setting but it fits and it has few advantages. Thanks to the outstanding soundtrack that underscores important scenes and contrasting art style, the tragic scenes/sequences aren't melodramatic and it manages to sell emotions without being overbearing. The art style also helps in creating bizarre and imaginary concepts like entering someone's memories or turning bodies into puddles when they get shot.\\n\\n\r\nKaiba is also filled with themes and ideas. First 7 episodes are basically waiting to be interpreted and analyzed. It involved various topics related to the society like consumerism, transhumanism, and gender identity but the main theme has always been love. Most of these early episodes are about love, be it a love with a partner or a love with family, it always revolved around love. Especially in the latter half of the show when it shifted its focus on Kaiba and Neiro relationship.\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings me to the next point, sadly I have to mention the finale, specifically 2 last episodes. While it did fit into the overall theme of the story and was consistent with the rest of the show it got necessarily convoluted. I think Yuasa should've stuck to a more simplistic approach without adding political shenanigans and twists. It would make an ending a lot clearer and stronger and It's this weird writing that made the second half inferior. I didn't mind and I actually liked when the show focused on Kaiba and main plot because I was interested in his character and his past specifically, but the show decided to take a more convoluted route instead of focusing on a few characters and build the ending around them. The development of Kaiba was kind of rushed or rather abrupt and other characters like Neiro or Popo got a lot more characterization.\\n\\n\r\nWhen all is said and done, Kaiba is a solid sci-fi show. It respects its viewers and isn't afraid of throwing at us deeper themes and ideas. Inferior second half didn't ruin the show completely and I will say that besides few problems with the ending, this show didn't have any other flaws. This type of show is rare now, taking into consideration that it also is a dystopian fiction makes it even rarer. Its uniqueness, world building, execution of themes and direction deserves a solid 9/10 from me.\\n",

The show runs on an episodic fashion \u2013 and though I am not normally an advocator of these sorts ofseries, I will give Kaiba credit, as it kept its themes consistent and characters do develop to the point for me having the courtesy to care about them.\\n\\n\r\nStory is a bit lacking in certain places, and that is probably mostly due to the Sheriff being a bit of wasted potential \u2013 it might infer to Kaiba\u2019s attempt in comprehending human care and emotion, though I don\u2019t seem to see that from him, even when the show is ending, there is just a \u2018lack thereof\u2019 an aftermath. \\n\\n\r\nProgression to the real plot doesn\u2019t happen until 7 episodes in, and I thought the show would simply be a coming of age road story and for the MC to finally mature. After that though, the whole \u2018save the world\u2019 part just felt crammed in quite unnecessarily \u2013 I personally didn\u2019t have as much enjoyment at that point, as the whole plot seems to zoom very quickly and we only get like five minutes or even far less, to \u2018cram\u2019 in the other character back stories which (though still better than a character merely to serve as a plot device) is just lacking and feels rushed. Maybe there was deeper message, that directing your pain to the world is \u201cNot\u201d a good idea? I thought it would make a better show if it were more of a road journey.\\n\\n\r\nI cannot stress that Yuasa is truly one of the most unique anime directors out there; the unconventional art style, with its basic forms of anatomical caricature, and the curved geometry that blends both artificial and biological designs gives the show a child-like aesthetic, which fits the show perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, a show that makes you think and if you want something truly different from all the modern shows, then this is definitely one of those gems for any anime veteran or anyone really into finding good anime in general, should watch. Far from perfect - especially in the end - but that does not stop it from being great.\\n",

(yes, I'm counting). for those who don't know already, I'm summing up series in a manner that allows one to read my descriptions without any spoilers, and know basically if they'll like this series. Without further ado, here it is:\r\nOk, basically this is in the style of Doraemon on acid, where the figures and characters (along with everything else in this anime) are all drawn in a very loose style. Despite this, the visual style is taken VERY seriously, meaning that despite not looking at all realistic, they have little that could be described as \"poor art\". Honestly, it's more like a separateuniverse than the lack of ability to draw, and it actually fits the dark, dark tone of the anime quite well. In fact, this anime is one of the few in which the story, sound and visuals all work to create a powerful force that, once you get hooked, it becomes very, very effective. Its story is also something to be talked about. It's the type of story that will force you to be either very attentive or to watch it multiple times. Ironically, neither of these things are a bad thing, because the anime is sooo good, if you like it, you may very well be watching it again and again just because its that powerful.\\n\\n\r\nSorry it's so long... I hope you got an Idea of this anime!",

            "content": "If nothing else Kaiba is unique. It starts out with a guy waking up with amnesia (how original....) and a gaping hole in his chest. He soon finds out that he lives in a world where memories are stored on little cone-shaped microchips, and bodies can be traded and swapped between individuals. While themes of memory and identity play big parts in Kaiba, the show doesn't explore these themes as well as other shows and movies have. The emphasis is more centered on the love story between Kaiba and a mysterious girl he sees in his locket. I usually don't like romance stories, but Ihave to say Kaiba does a good job at it. The story would be alright but Kaiba's style is where it really shines. The designs of the characters and settings evoke a retro feel. It's very much like a mix between Tezuka and an old Nicklodeon cartoon. It definitely does not look like the stereotypical big eyes/small mouth anime style. The animation is, for the most part, fantastic with the exception of a few episodes which look a little sketchy. As for the soundtrack, it wasn't very memorable except for the opener. Not to say it was bad or anything, just not fantastic. Kaiba isn't the greatest anime ever but it's so original that it deserves to be watched. Unfortunately, it might be a little too original for American companies seeing as it has not and probably never will be licensed for the US. If you want to watch it, you'll have to download.",

            "content": "Story: 9\r\nKaiba is definitely a roller coaster that will throw you around. I definitely liked the more episodic stories at the beginning of the series. Those are the ones that we can somewhat relate to, each with their own problems. I found the ending of the series somewhat confusing; it felt pretty rushed, and I just couldn't make any sense of it. However, that doesn't make the series any less enjoyable.\r\nArt: 8\r\nI really didn't know how to rate the art - because it's so unconventional, I don't really have anything to compare it to. On one hand, it's simple, and at first seems greatly contrastedagainst the matureness of the story. However, because it is so simple, the art contributed toward its dream-like appearance, adding atmosphere. In addition, I personally felt that I was able to take the series more seriously due to the nature of the art - it's not like other anime, so I pay more attention to it and what happens in the story. Not to mention everything is so smooth - it may look like designs were just made up without any planning, but all the art is so consistent - the backgrounds, the characters, the detail.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nA lot of the soundtrack is this ethereal, dream-like lull, save for a few tracks fitting for chase scenes. The soft tracks contribute to the dream-like atmosphere of the series, but that means on the surface, it appears to lack emotion. It doesn't really feel like a piece that will cause you to be emotional just by listening to it. However, one can argue that because it doesn't force the emotions on you, that it also promotes the emotion of the scene - it adds without being noticeable. For example, that one specific \"piano\" piece in episode three (and comes back in later episodes) is very simple, and doesn't vary too much in terms of dynamics and other emotional aspects. However, when coupled with the scenes it is played against, it adds to the emotion that is being thrown at you.\\n\r\nThe opening and ending themes are no different - again with the dream-like, lulling atmosphere. Not something that I'm really into, however.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nAs a lot of people have mentioned, a lot of the time you will end up sympathizing with the \"bad guy\" and kind of hating on the \"good guy\". I think it's great that there's more than one side of each character; each person's motivations have a hidden side that no one else knows about - and this is true for real life. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8",

            "content": "This anime is sincerely a gem that needs more attention. I found some old notes I took on this amazing work and decided on a whim just now that I should take the time to compile them so that maybe someone new may witness its grandeur.\r\nThe first thing that caught my attention was the artwork. It was more cartoon-like, so I was uncertain how serious I should take the show. But slowly I witnessed how sinister the world truly was. After a while I began to notice all the subtleties and supporting elements the artwork helped establish, and I quickly grew fond of it thereonwards. As for the plot at the beginning, it had me hooked with the the way it conveyed thought provoking questions to the audience - it always left me wondering about something after watching an episode. On another note, the main character was quiet and complacent most of the time. This allowed the environment and people around him develop the story instead, engrossing the audience further into the world. In a span of one mere episode, many morals were put into question, including not only the relationships between family and friends but the relationship between one's own mind and body as well.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the story goes, it was capable of delivering moral ambiguities and mixed emotions with an apathetically melodramatic tone, if that makes sense. The atmosphere was very calm and lull like, but at the same time the audience was sometimes forced to witness something morally outrageous. This seems hard to do, but Kaiba successfully pulled it off. There is this dissonance created between how sinister and selfish the world is and how the world is portrayed to the audience.\\n\\n\r\nThe story repetitively showed how dark the world was, but it also showed glimpses of love and compassion throughout the series. Yes humans are selfish, depraved, and weak-willed, but they also have the potential to become selfless, compassionate, and courageous. I enjoyed how there was always a glimmer of hope no matter how inauspicious the story developed.\\n\\n\r\nI can't forget to talk about how unorthodox the plot is delivered. Like what we've seen in Baccano and the famous western flick, Pulp-fiction, the story is not told in a chronological order. Instead, it throws you into a world you have no connection with and forces you to observe and come to your own conclusions about what is going on. Seriously, you will have no idea what's going on at first, but that is fine because neither does the main character. As the story progresses everything starts to make sense. Although, once you get a real understanding of the plot it begins to jump back and forth between events and memories, giving more depth to the characters and answering many questions, but still leaving more to be answered until the final moment where all the pieces finally come together and everything becomes clear.\\n\\n\r\nWith all this in mind, this anime obviously isn't for everyone. But if you are looking for a wild ride where you need to be sitting in your thinking chair and wearing your thinking cap to not fall off, Kaiba is most definitely worth checking out.",

The obvious difference of this anime compared to others that can be seen immediately, is its art, which makes it more interesting, at least for me. Its art is unique, and its like an answered prayer when I saw it because I am longing for an anime that is different from the usual. \r\nFinding out the real identity of Warp is not simple. Episodes are usually confusing if you are not paying attention to it,but it is still interesting. It gives me headache everytime I finish one\ud83d\ude02 \\n\\n\r\nI liked how the mystery around Warp is kept throughout the show. It compells the audience to think and to question his character and those of around him.\\n\\n\r\nStories of different people with different dispositions in life were also told, which a part I really like in an anime. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters are great, some remained mysterious until the final episode (aside from Warp), some of them are consumed by greed, lost sight of why and what they wanted to be, some showed an unconditional love, some are blind to the true meaning of treasure, etc.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Kaiba is about human nature, society and humanity.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the show, it made me think a lot, and it made me feel a lot.\\n\\n",

I definitely can see that he put a lot of effort in this anime, resulting in a spectacular show which deviates from mainstream anime conventions. While this is one reason why many liked the show, in my opinion, it is also the main reason why the show is just average. \r\nThe visuals are impressive as it deviates from the established anime look and is trying something new, resulting in a fresh aesthetic that screams Masaaki Yuasa. The soundis also very good as it is complementing the visuals and sucks you in a state of mind that results in melancholy and reflexion. These are the strong suits that regardless of my criticism, should absolutely be appreciated. \\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like? Everything else. The story is one which at first seems interesting. It follows a boy with amnesia who is traveling through the universe. It is simple but is also effective in showcasing the world and introducing themes such humanity and morality. Things start good but finish awfully. By the second part, the show has just started to feel rushed and incomprehensive. The passing is just bad as at the beginning is slow and at the end, you don't even understand what is going on the show. There are elements that are badly explained at best and to this day, I still don't understand what was the point of that....\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are badly written, I don't understand their motivation and what they are trying to achieve. Warp/Kaiba is still a conundrum to me as I still don't know why he lost his memory or what he wanted to do. The only character that I ended up enjoying is the sheriff, who is the only non-one-dimensional character. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I think this was done asa way to experiment with the animation style and not so much as to tell a story. It is format over content and this is what ruined it for me. \\n",

A character falls from the sky, leaving his memory (who he was and how he lived) behind. Now, we begin to follow him as he discovers new things about himself & his past, and the world around him becomes more and more interesting. Each episode of Kaiba is another move through the plot, like moving pieces to solve a sliding puzzle. While Kaiba is not a mystery, the story flows along the lines of what is notknown about the main character and the curiosity of learning about the people around him. Themes of the show: memory, power, disillusionment, devotion, sacrifice..\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this series is what really sets it apart. Creating an innocent atmosphere, the drawing of the animation is unique to the series and quite unlike that of the typical anime styling. The art, combined with the soundtrack create a mood of wonder. The soundtrack will not jump out at you, it isn't loud, it's soothing and often nonexistent or silent. It blends with the animation, as if it is natural to the movement of the story. \\n\\n\r\nNaturally, Kaiba is a character that most will sympathize with. He has amnesia, there is cause for us to care about him. And through the series you don't really know him, he doesn't know himself, until the last few episodes because he is without memory, without a past. The people around him mold him with their memories.\\n\\n\r\nThe series is enjoyable because it goes beyond the character and looks at what make s a person valuable. Is it personality, things they've done, things they will do, who they know, who cares for them, who they care for? Why is someone worth saving?\\n\\n\r\n*positive/negative feedback via message or comment is greatly appreciated*",

Far from the usual japanese traits, his graphic style very simple contrasts really complex thematics. Kaiba is the story of a failed utopia, of a world fallen into decay after a discovery by the huge proportions, but the small size: a cone-shaped metal chip that can store the memories of the people. You can also delete or modify any memories or add artificial. In a short time the body and mind end up being entities completely separate and unrelated and, almost with the value that is givento simple objects of consumption, bodies and memories begin to be sold on the market: everyone can have the memories and the bodies they want, at the right price. Philosophy, psychology, ethics and social inequality are woven into this intricate work even in the course of events: every detail is essential, it's necessary that nothing escapes the eye. However, a second vision is more than recommended and the music are phenomenal.",

The animation is cute and simplistic, but immensely expressive and occasionally seriously gorgeous--insofar as one is making tracks while watching anime, Kaiba's visuals managed to stop me in them several times. Throw in a surprisingly well-realized sci-fi vision (albeit a far zanier sci-fi fiction than what you typically see--think the 1973 French animation Fantastic Planet and you're on the right track) and a seriously beautiful and haunting soundtrack and you've pretty much got an instant masterpiece. It arguably loses its way a little bit in the final half,but its explorations of memory, love, and class-warfare set in a world where life is cheap and the human spirit is as mutable as wet clay are top-notch, and the love-story (and the mysteries that surround the two lovers) is strongly expressed, hitting notes that you tend to not see in anime. Hugely recommended. Just note that despite it's cute appearances (and the fact that everyone bleeds green, if they bleed at all) this is not an anime for children, and some adults may be a bit disturbed by the territory it explores, as well.",

            "content": "Review in English and Spanish /Rese\u00f1a en ingles y espa\u00f1ol.\r\n-------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------- ---------\r\nWell, I'll tell you about Kaiba:\r\nA work at the hands of God MADHOUSE, and did not refer specifically to the study, but to the man who is MADHOUSE; Masao Mayurama, the guy who made the studio big with his own hands and gave him a prestige that continues even today, when he has already left that study.\r\nMaruyama went personally with Yuasa to put him in charge of 2 projects, Kaiba and Tatami Galaxy, as well as helping in the planning of the first.\r\nBeing from MADHOUSE -2011 there was some quality control, so they puta staff more than capable. Creative freedom in each group for each chapter.\\n\r\nIn 2008 he saw the light with a duration of 12 chapters.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, we enter into his argument, Kaiba tells us a journey to self-discovery from the perspective, then, of Kaiba, who does not remember anything of his past, why? Put ourselves in the context of the world, in the world of Kaiba there is the change of body and memories through a \"chips\" and create bodies, high-class people can afford to buy bodies and even memories, which Of low society can not do, but they have to save chips when they fuck the body, hoping to get a new one or sell their body to help with some expenses, in addition to that memories can be easily manipulated to Any end, whether good or bad. We are shown the whole theme of body changes as references to real-world taboos. The world and the concepts are too imaginative, you will hardly find something similar.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the characters, in the first instance, Kaiba is not very important for the viewer, he shows us what he sees, he knows some characters who\\n\r\nFound in x planets, we are presented the motivations and aspirations of the secondary, then to fuck in them cruelly, I know that I have shit in many works for the fact of introducing characters in a cap, kill them in this one and then make a drama Forced, here is different, by introducing us many things of the characters, you manage to empathize quite well with them and to elaborate a plausible drama.\\n\r\nAs we move forward, we can see some of the problems of society, as Kaiba, his past, and so on are gradually revealed.\\n\r\nThere are revelations at the end that have repercussion from the beginning of the series and explain the actions of some characters, as well as tell us who is the fucker who flies next to Kaiba in his adventure (Hyo, I think it was called) or the strange \"ostrich\" Who protects him (Hal), as well as elaborate a more than decent romance that has chemistry in its characters.\\n\\n\r\nIt could be said that Popo is the \"antagonist\" (Since it is not even necessary to speak of the other 4, decent at the beginning and worthy side to the penultimate chapter, in addition\\n\r\nThat 4th is the worst). Popo, although manipulated is trying to fulfill his objectives (the guy is well screwed) and as with most of the characters, we show his motivations, goals, past, etc. Lastly, when he turns from Seele and tries to make the plan of human complementation, he goes down the character. Simplmenete can no longer understand the acting of the character, how do you achieve this from one chapter to another? Making the character change personality or exaggerating it.\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of the few series that seemed to me to be a perfect 10/10, unfortunately it was not so, for the last chapters the series changes its rhythm severely (possibly by the changes of director by episode), no longer feels like that work Excellent at the beginning, very fast, unsatisfactory and open. A message different from the one the series had been developing since the beginning, in addition to that the wick seemed something out of place. Everything is worth it but it turns out not later. It turns out that Shinji rejects the complementation and end.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow let's talk about the technical section, we have Yuasa as director and creator of the work, showing ultra dynamic plans when necessary and a normal passing, neither slow nor accelerated (at least at first), the composition is also very good, something OST Simple but quite payable, I must highlight Melody of Croniko and The Tree Song, which are put at the right time and in my opinion, are excellent, although not the great thing compared to other compositions.\\n\r\nOpening and ending enjoyable.\\n\r\nThe style of characters is a very characteristic, by way of prejudice may seem rather childish, but it is quite the opposite.\\n\r\nAnimation is mostly fluid and does not come out of the mold. It changes according to the director in some chapters but it is not out of place.\\n\r\nThe palette is full of life and is perfect with the style of characters, although it acquires a more muted for the last chapters.\\n\\n\r\nAn anime that could be perfect, but still remains as one of the best works existing in the middle of animation.\\n\r\nExcellent, highly recommended.\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nBueno, les hablare de Kaiba:\\n\\n\r\nUna obra a manos del Dios MADHOUSE, y no me refiero espec\u00edficamente al estudio, sino al hombre que es MADHOUSE; Masao Mayurama, el tipo que hizo grande al estudio con sus propias manos y le dio un prestigio que sigue incluso hoy en d\u00eda, cuando ya se ha marchado de dicho estudio.\\n\r\nMaruyama fue personalmente con Yuasa para ponerlo a cargo de 2 proyectos, Kaiba y Tatami Galaxy, as\u00ed como tambi\u00e9n ayudo en la planeaci\u00f3n de la primera.\\n\r\nAl ser del MADHOUSE -2011 hab\u00eda cierto control de calidad, as\u00ed que pusieron a un staff mas que capaz. Libertad creativa en cada grupo para cada capitulo.\\n\r\nEn 2008 vio la luz con una duraci\u00f3n de 12 cap\u00edtulos.\\n\\n\r\nPrimero, adentr\u00e9monos en su argumento, Kaiba nos cuenta un viaje a de auto descubrimiento desde la perspectiva, pues, de Kaiba, quien no recuerda nada de su pasado, \u00bfporqu\u00e9? Pong\u00e1monos en el contexto del mundo, en el mundo de Kaiba existe el cambio de cuerpo y recuerdos a trav\u00e9s de unos \"chips\" y se crean cuerpos artificiales, las personas de clase alta pueden darse el lujo de comprar cuerpos e incluso recuerdos, cosa que los de la baja sociedad no pueden hacer, sino que ellos tienen que guardar los chips cuando se les jode el cuerpo, con la esperanza de conseguir uno nuevo o vender su cuerpo para ayudar con algunos gastos, ademas de que los recuerdos pueden ser manipulados f\u00e1cilmente para cualquier fin, ya sea bueno o malo. Se nos muestra todo el tema de los cambios de cuerpo como referencias a tab\u00fas del mundo real. El mundo y los conceptos son demasiado imaginativos, dif\u00edcilmente encontrar\u00e1s algo similar.\\n\\n\r\nHablando de los personajes, en primera instancia, Kaiba no es muy importante para el espectador, se nos muestra lo que \u00e9l ve, va conociendo a algunos personajes que \\n\r\nencuentra en x planetas, se nos presentan las motivaciones y aspiraciones de los secundarios, para despu\u00e9s cagarse en ellos cruelmente, s\u00e9 que me he cagado en muchas obras por el hecho de introducir personajes en un cap, matarlos en \u00e9ste mismo y luego hacer un drama forzado, ac\u00e1 es diferente, al presentarsenos muchas cosas de los personajes, logras empalizar bastante bien con ellos y elaborar un drama plausible.\\n\r\nA medida que vamos avanzando se dejan ver algunos problemas de la sociedad, as\u00ed como se revela poco a poco el quien es Kaiba, su pasado, etc.\\n\r\nHay revelaciones al final que tienen repercusi\u00f3n desde el principio de la serie y explican las acciones de algunos personajes, as\u00ed como decirnos quien es la chingadera  que vuela junto a Kaiba en su aventura (Hyo, creo que se llamaba) o el extra\u00f1o \"avestruz\" que lo protege (Hal), as\u00ed como elaboran un romance mas que decente que tiene qu\u00edmica en sus personajes.\\n\\n\r\nSe podr\u00eda decir que Popo es el \"antagonista\" (Ya que ni siquiera hace falta hablar de los otros 4, decentes al principio y valiendo verga al pen\u00faltimo capitulo, ademas \\n\r\nde que el 4to es el peor). Popo, aunque manipulado va tratando de cumplir sus objetivos (El tipo esta bien jodido) y al igual que con la mayor\u00eda de los personajes, nos muestran sus motivaciones, objetivos, pasado, etc. Lastimosamente, cuando se vuelve de Seele y trata de hacer el plan de la complementaci\u00f3n humana, se va para abajo el personaje. Simplemente ya no se puede entender el actuar del personaje, \u00bfc\u00f3mo se logra esto de un capitulo para otro? Haciendo que el personaje cambie de personalidad o exagerando la misma.\\n\\n\r\nEsta es una de las pocas series que me parec\u00edan ser un 10/10 perfecto, lastimosamente no fue as\u00ed, por los \u00faltimos cap\u00edtulos la serie cambia su ritmo severamente (Posiblemente por los cambios de director por episodio), ya no se siente como esa obra excelente del principio, queda muy acelerado, insatisfactorio y abierto. Un mensaje distinto al que la serie venia desarrollando desde el principio, ademas de que el mecha me pareci\u00f3 algo fuera de lugar. Todo vale verga pero resulta que luego no. Resulta que Shinji rechaza la complementaci\u00f3n y fin.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAhora hablemos del apartado t\u00e9cnico, tenemos a Yuasa como director y creador de la obra, mostrando planos ultra din\u00e1micos cuando es necesario y un passing normal, ni lento ni acelerado (Al menos al principio), la composici\u00f3n tambi\u00e9n es muy buena, un OST algo simple pero bastante pagadizo, debo resaltar Melody of Croniko y The Tree Song, que son puestas en el momento indicado y a mi parecer, son excelentes, aunque no es la gran cosa comparado con otras composiciones. \\n\r\nOpening y ending disfrutables.\\n\r\nEl estilo de personajes es uno muy caracter\u00edstico, a modo de prejuicio puede parecer bastante infantil, pero es todo lo contrario.\\n\r\nAnimaci\u00f3n mayoritariamente fluida y no se sale del molde. Cambia conforme al director en algunos cap\u00edtulos pero no queda fuera de lugar.\\n\r\nLa paleta esta de llena de vida y le queda perfecto con el estilo de personajes, aunque adquiere una mas apagada para los \u00faltimos cap\u00edtulos.\\n\\n\r\nUn anime que pudo ser perfecto, pero igual queda como una de las mejores obras existentes en el medio de la animaci\u00f3n.\\n\r\nExcelente, muy recomendable.",

The whole premise of the show is very unique and the whole story fells like a massive piece of art (not in a bad subjective way).\r\nThe simplistic artstyle combined with the atmospheric colours and animation really set the tone of it's surroundings not to mention how well setup the story is and along with it's premise.\r\nIf you're going to end up watching this be prepared for some underlying melancholy and confusion throughout it, but damnis it good. \\n\r\nI highly recommend it for people who want to watch a long story with a conclusion a long with a whole lot of artistic integrity in it.",

            "content": "Watchout ! Review made by French guy ! I will try to be objective.... Yeah, wish me good luck.\r\nHere's some existential dilemma. It's easy to create a more or less good constructed review about a bad anime. I made some review about what I tought was more that ordinary or a waste, but never about an anime I love. Why ? Because it's hard. It's hard because you can't just review something you love, you have to analyse it, savor it, and here isn't the place. Make a review about something that is good for ourself is too difficult, because saying it's good or amasterpiece is just like saying something you can always say. So, that was my existentiel trouble, thanks for reading !\\n\\n\r\nNo seriously... Kaiba. Well, oh damn good lord, here we go. This is a f**king brillant piece of art. Maybe a little less than Tatami Galaxy from the same director, but sure is that Kaiba is a troubling and brillant sci-fi work. It's so fresh that the air seem beautiful, everywhere, after you have seen this. But after a while, everything seem the cripple itself, because, the joy of Kaiba disapear when you know that other original masterpiece like this are more than rare. Well, let's really begin shall we ?\\n\\n\r\nArt :\\n\\n\r\nChildish, clear, colorful, accurate, original and it's liked a monk that you can't judge by his clothes. Kaiba is a cyberpunk sci-fi anime, and it doesn't look like it. It don't have the typycal design of cyborg limb, the character look strange and everything have strange proportion. It's not scribbled-like as Tatami Galaxy or Kemonozume/Mind Game, it's more easy to watch, but more disturbing. Some will like, other will not. It's a question of what kind of artistic feel people are searching. Useless to say that I love it. Everything in the world of Kaiba have a fresh design that is always good to see like some new discovery you make when you are a child. It's a risk-taking artstyle and it's perfect for what it's trying to be.\\n\\n\r\nSound :\\n\\n\r\nHere is another distorbing thing. The music and sound-design of Kaiba don't follow what you will habitually see in a sci-fi cyberpunk anime. It seems more light-hearted. Just watch the opening and you will understand. With the childish art-design, the soundtrack complete what Kaiba is even before the story/character. And that's because it automatically create a distinguished universe. Just by listening the soundtrack, it's possible to imagine what the art-design could be, and that's something important. A masterpiece can't be a masterpiece just by beeing good. Weel, yeah... it can. But, it's not the same thing.....oh well.\\n\r\nHere is a little flaw though. There isn't many prominent piece of music in Kaiba. Every each and one of them have something special. But, they aren't perfectly presented everytime. Well yeah, it is in reallity....But, let's say that the soundtrack lost itself without the anime....here's why my 9 out of a 10.... Yeah, it's just to say that it can't be THAT perfect. What is a masterpiece without fault ? Hmmmm.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter :\\n\\n\r\nIt could have been 10, but at the end, Kaiba make a horrible mistake, but it's due to the 13 format episode anime...maybe.\\n\r\nEvery character in Kaiba has a personnality. Not just every important... noooo, every single one ! At the first episode, it's the best time to see this when Kaiba (lead character) see some people trying to find the memory of a member of their family. Every member is presented in a fast laps of time and it's more than enough to understand the entire universe of the anime. The first half of the anime, before the real story begin, is like this, and it's the better part. Subtle clich\u00e9 and a good use of theme, original personnality, intense emotion, there is everything to make a perfect cast !\\n\r\nHere is the problem, the second half of Kaiba, where the story begin... It's not that the quality drop. It's just that the story is less interesting that the first half world building episodes. So, the character seem less \"fresh\". Their evolution is more predictable and d\u00e9j\u00e0-vu. It's all good thing. But it's just \"good, very good\" thing. The developpment seems rushed out and the evolution of the psychology was more to show a moral for the character, more than a real evolution, and it's a little frustrating. That's why a 8. Easy, put 10 for the first part, and 8 for the second. But the change is so intense, that it's an important fault.\\n\\n\r\nStory :\\n\\n\r\nAnd so, the story. Same thing than the character : first half perfect, more than excellent second part, but feel rushed, what is a little disturbing, in the bad sens of the way, mainly for the three last episodes. The anime seem sto remind itself, in the middle, that it had a story to tell. Some revelation are just beautiful and a piece of art, but other are d\u00e9j\u00e0-vu and typical none-predictable thing. But here's the thing : Kaiba had a story to tell, yes, but before this, it had a universe and philosophical theme to develop. And THAT, is what really put Kaiba as a masterpiece with the art and soudtrack. There is some deep metaphore that will take many time to develop in our head. The anime don't want to just tell a story. It want to show something, and then, want that everybody try to develop these thing for themselves. It's a way of creating a story, more than a fault. Still, the last episodes are rushed and the final scene really need some thinking, because the story itself is not suffcient to explain it.\\n\r\nOh yeah, there is some intense and oneiric emotions too !\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyement :\\n\\n\r\nOh. 10 ? Yeah, 10. Kaiba is an anime to feel and to think about. It's not just about a story, but it's about ideas and this is what this work so marveluous. I can't say that Kaiba don't have flaw. But I can't really say that these flaws are bad. A think that a real \"perfect\" masterpiece would be more mainstream thant original. In the way that, flaw are a necessity to lead to thought. Without flaw, the mistery behind a piece of art is less. So, how can we say that something is a masterpiece or not ? Well, it some debateable philosophy. But, things seem always more oustanding when frustrating. Kaiba achieve to creat an interesting balance between these two extreme. I suppose it's about what the creators wanted to create, the epoch when this is created, and about the perception the we, ourselves, have. I don't think saying that Kaiba is a masterpiece is really subjective. But I do think that saying it's perfect and the best thing in the world is subjective. I don't think seeing Kaiba as something that have to be perfect is a good idea. Kaiba meant to be savour like something with nuance that just want to show that it exist.\\n\\n\r\nA subjective overall indeed, but a 10 out of 10. But, I give a 8 out of a 10 for trying being more objective, but it's according to want you want to find in it. Can't deny that Kaiba is an outstanding work. But, this note is different form an 8 for other anime. It's an 8 about that Kaiba didn't achieve perfectly what it was trying to do. It's not an 8 that can be compared to ohter anime though.\\n\\n\r\nThank for reading, I hope my english was comprenhensible ! show less",

            "content": "Story\r\nKaiba is a story about an abstract world where an individual's existence is defined by their memory. The anime applies the theme of existence, self interest and happiness within such a context and does so in an way that is likely to elicit emotions from the viewers who abide by the common virtues. We are heralded into kaiba without much of a background of the world. There seems to be events occuring but because they are not explained we do not initially understand their significance, but as the story progress we begin to learn more of the world and the characters within it. The protagonistis introduced to the world in the same manner that we are, without any knowledge of it whatsoever because it seems that his memory disappear. He is similar to us in that sense, but I also felt that I shared his morality. As he ventures through what I suppose is the creator of the anime's perception of a dystopia within such a context, I find myself, similar to him, pained by the lack of virtue of other characters. What I see is the byproduct of greed and the desire for power that led to the demise of other individuals.\\n\\n\r\nStructure\\n\\n\r\nThe structure of kaiba is episodic, each episode is independent of one another, but there does exist instances where overarching characters appear within multiple episodes and these instances should be noted upon because they will likely be alluded upon in later episodes thus giving them significance.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nI found that the manner in which kaiba developed their characters to be quite nice. We are initially not given much about their characters, but as we progress we learn more and more about them. This is core for mostly any time of story telling but I found the manner in which kaiba dragged the character development to the point of which it pulls the greatest significance to be a really appealing factor. \\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound\\n\\n\r\nI was quite fond of the art style. Though it striked me as initially very childish based on the similarities with western style animation, the adult themes which the anime employed helped to sway me to believe otherwise. The creator of kaiba also does a good job is using imagery and symbolism to showcase such an abstract world and it was easy to discern these representations. The music also quite complements the anime by setting an appropriate tone for the viewer to understand the significance of what was occurring.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I was quite fond of Kaiba, but I have to give it criticism for lack of depth for such an abstract world. The core focus of the anime seemed to target at morality and explored many different virtures within each episode, but it did not substantially explore the abstract concepts of the world. So while it did elicit a great deal of emotions within me, I have to admit that there is not a great deal of philosophical meaning within kaiba. I am not saying that their is none, but it is merely glanced upon.\\n\\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nFor those that may have trouble interpreting kaiba, I can showcase the manner in which the creator shows implicit meaning. This section of the review will contain spoilers for episode 3 so be warned. Though it is a spoiler, I believe it will give a good basis of understanding the way in which the anime showcase it's meaning implicitly. \\n\\n\r\nIn episode 3, the protagonist encounters a girl that had decided to sell her body for the sake of her family. We have already been given the fact that memories and bodies can be sold for money within the initial part of episode 2 and other episodes there after till the last. The significant aspect comes when we are shown how much her guardian lamented her existence. Initially, we do not know the reason, but later as the protagonist encounters the guardian we begin to learn. When the protagonist ventures into the memory of the guardian it seemed as if the guardian was quite fond of the girl. It should be noted that in this instance, we are shown a library with books and these are symbolic representations of memory as shown by it's implication. It seemed contradictory that the guardian would act in such a way towards the girl because they seemed to of had such a good relationship. The answer to the reason why is shown to us when the guardian starts to play the piano that she had once played with the girl and her memories of the girl return and the guardian's dismay upon realizing what she had done. At this point, I also realized what had occurred though the reason had not been given to me directly but subtly referenced upon. The guardian had sold her happy memories of the girl because of financial reasons. As a result the guardian held contempt over the girl and found means of ridding her for the sake of money. But when the guardian buys back the her own memories, she begins to recall the relationship she had with the girl and the cruel reality of what she had done.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the type of beauty that you will see within kaiba. It is very cruel in the way that it tears your heart apart, but in that sense it is also beautiful.",

            "content": "Yup, this is another Madhouse production with the surreal imagery and animation used again like in the previous entry, Kemonozume, and it is also from the same director Masaaki Yuuki, which debuted on the WOWOW network in the spring of 2008 in Japan. Despite the Dr. Seuss-lite appearance of the show, the show is a science-fiction romance story which in the series, it\u2019s now possible to store memory data into a body so the death of somebody wouldn\u2019t really be a \u201cdeath\u201d, they are just transferred to new bodies but because of that discovery, or \u201cmemory trading\u201d, it is now become very illegal to stealmemories and trade them for others. The society in that world is being degenerated; authority is losing its grip towards the state of having the rich and powerful beings to barter others\u2019 bodies and memories for their own enjoyment and longevity while those who have various money problems have to struggle finding a good body for themselves or a loved one. The main plot consists of a boy named Kaiba, who woke up in a smashed room and has no memories of his own and he find a pendant with a picture of an unknown woman named Niero inside of it. Then after being attacked, he escapes into space and meet all sorts of people and starting to regain most of his memories and still be of worry of the problems of the world, especially of why does he exist?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOne of the important features in the series is the ability to store memories inside of a body and like in the real world, where we use flash drives, memory sticks, and external hard drives, memory chips are exactly like that but with minor differences. It is a great convenience and advantage but prolonging their ego can make them vulnerable to an extent putting them at the attacker\u2019s mercy if it\u2019s removed.  Also there is the use of memory tanks, as in when a person dies or is killed, their memories are released as small yellow-orange beans floating away, creating rivers of dead people\u2019s memories out in space.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters in the show, they often jump into every different character throughout the whole run of the series and there is a lot of deeper characterization within them, mostly from the title character and Niero. Popo, the public voice for Issoudan, the anti-memory chip organization, is a decent and perfectly flawed character but as for Vanilla, the sadistic sheriff who also has a weakness for extremely kawaii girls (which Chroniko, a girl who sells her body so the money can support her family, comes in) wasn\u2019t actually needed for the show. I feel like he is just there for\u2026..something but he felt useless to me.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow for the animation and its surreal imagery and strange surroundings, this is miles ahead and completely surpasses Kemonozume in that department. Yes, some of the characters do look like little children but this is another world we are enchanted in and it felt more finished and not at all rushed before production was finished. The soundtrack for this has an more ambient feel in the background music and it enhances them well together and the opening and ending songs \u201cNever\u201d & \u201cCarry Me Away\u201d, both sung by Seira Kagami, are very welcoming and comforting to listen to and what\u2019s weird about it is that the songs are in English but yes, there is no English dub of this.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nFINAL VERDICT: This is one anime that had some good things about it going for it and originally I thought it wasn\u2019t going to be excellent. It\u2019s a great anime that\u2019s also good for the mind in your anime diet and also requires all of your attention whenever but at some times, you\u2019ll tend to drift off a few times if you are a casual/rising anime fan like myself but give it a try if you can handle reading subtitles.\\n",
