            "content": "Over the few years or so, it\u2019s been increasingly apparent that watching anything associated with moe is to be treated with the same sort of caution as doing yoga, or making origami. Generally you\u2019d do all three in the privacy of your own room, preferably with the lights dimed down and curtains tightly shut. (I am speaking of course, mainly for guys).\r\nYes there is much shame to be had in admitting you enjoy watching K-On!!, because who in their right mind would enjoy a plotless moeblob slice-of-life show over say\u2026 the testosterone filled battle epic TTGL? Certainly no one would admit to such an atrociousact to their friends face to face, (or anything less than a distance of 100 miles and 2 computer screens for that matter). Hence it becomes extremely hard to be objective when posed with the question, \u2018Is K-On!! a good anime?\u2019, because all of our social preservation instincts scream \u201crun away!\u201d, while somewhere deep in the soft side of our hearts, something keeps us rooted to our chair and our eyes on our displays.\\n\r\n(Unless you factor in the anonymity of the internet of course, in which case, proudly declaring that K-On!! is awesome and giving it a 9/10 is A-O-K.)\\n\\n\r\nJokes aside though, in recent times I feel that too much anime are being categorized based on if they have any moe elements in them. While there\u2019s nothing wrong with giving labeling an anime as containing moe, it unfairly depicts certain anime as catering towards the niche otaku audience and suggests it\u2019s lack of depth and unoriginality, which in many cases simply isn\u2019t true. Take Lucky Star for example. Who\u2019s to say that it was just a mindless moeblob?\\n\\n\r\nAnyway I had a review here somewhere\u2026 I would go as far as to say that I love the slice-of-life genre. Honey & Clover (which I maintain is more slice-of-life than romance) and Aria remain firmly at my number 1 and 2 spot. For a great slice-of-life, there are a number of criteria that one needs to fill, but the simplest and most important is that every episode should end with you feeling relaxed and contented with a smile on your face. Does K-On!! achieve this? Yes, absolutely 100% yes.\\n\\n\r\nK-On!! follows a relatively frugal format in terms of storyline. You wouldn\u2019t go into each episode expecting anything dramatic or exhilarating, and for some this may be what they like to call boring. But then again, you wouldn\u2019t open a bag of chips expecting M&Ms and chocolate fudge, so why you go into K-On!! expecting anything even resembling a continuous plot? K-On!!\u2019s style single episodic scenarios work greatly in it\u2019s favor, viewers are never startled with annoying cliffhangers or feel an obligation to keep up with it in fear of missing out on some important plot element. If watching K-On!! becomes a chore (I\u2019m looking at you Bleach manga), then it\u2019s missed the point completely, and in this regard, I give K-On!!\u2019s \u2018plot\u2019 two thumbs up.\\n\\n\r\nDespite this though, K-On!! deals with some surprisingly deep themes that would go right over the heads of most casual viewers. One definite improvement from it\u2019s first season is the branching out of the limited focus of club practice (eating cake) to wider array of activities. Granted, most of them are still obvious and predictable, the sort of been-there done-that stories we\u2019ve all seen before, but the shift allowed K-On!! to focus on many different aspects and resort less to what I like to call \u2018moe-moments\u2019 in order to fill up the 24 minutes. Lets face it, how many different ways can you eat, drink and procrastinate before it starts getting old? Instead though, from the summer trips to school plays to the air conditioning campaigns, K-On!! moves away from the same-ness of cake/tea/practice/more cake in the first season and closer to true slice-of-life.\\n\\n\r\nK-On!!\u2019s real brilliance shines in the final 6-7 episodes or so, as the girls neared the finale of their school life, the realization that their after school tea times can\u2019t last forever hits them quietly and their are faced with the challenges of change and the future. Though not exactly compelling and dramatic, it nevertheless teaches us that our beloved peaceful times cannot always last forever, which only makes them more precious, not unlike Aria the Origination, but on a smaller scale. K-On!\u2019s main idea was a carefree life of daily cake, tea and music with not a worry in the world, but K-On!!\u2019s step away from that ultimately paid off and turned what would have been just a mediocre moeblob into a great slice-of-life.\\n\\n\r\nI supposed I\u2019d better tackle the moe problem, as it seems to be the main issue dragging K-On!! down. Yes, there is a lot of it. Yes, it gets annoying. Yes, it is overused and detracts from the overall effect. Would K-On!! be better without it? Probably. But then it wouldn\u2019t be K-On!!. Yes you can all come and egg my house afterwards for using such a cliche argument, but there is some wisdom in my words, ladies and gentlemen. As much as we all hate to admit it, moe has become an integral part of the characterization of the K-On!! girls. Yui simply wouldn\u2019t believe the same if she didn\u2019t drool over Azu-nyan or cake, Azu-nyan wouldn\u2019t be the same if she didn\u2019t get embarrassed over every little thing and Mugi simply can\u2019t exist without her air-headed-ness and cheerfulness. Sure, they could do without it, but then they\u2019d be different characters completely. Big Macs would probably taste better with tomato sauce instead of mayo, but then they wouldn\u2019t be Big Macs anymore, if you get what I mean. Even though I make better tasting burgers myself, I wouldn\u2019t want to have Big Macs any other way.\\n\\n\r\nAnd to be fair, a lot of the moe-hate stem from people who watch 3-4 episodes, drop it, and then go complain about it on forums. As I followed K-On!! throughout it\u2019s season, I was quietly surprised as the moe-moments gradually thinned out little by little. It was as if as the girls grew older, the show slowly matured along with them. Don\u2019t believe me? Well, don\u2019t my word for it, see for yourself. Right now. Open up say episode 2 or 3, count how many moe-moments there are, and then compare them to a later episode, say, 21 or something. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not going anywhere so take your time\u2026 Ok\u2026 done? See? Good. Anyway as I was saying, the gradual fade of moe was was subtle and barely noticeable, but for those paying attention it was a nice touch, and went along well with the tone of bittersweetness of the end of their high school lives.\\n\\n\r\nI guess it\u2019ll be wrong to not comment on the music of K-On!! seeing as how that was kinda the whole theme that they were going for. Honestly speaking, it really isn\u2019t half bad. Toyosaki Aki (Yui)\u2019s cute but horrendous out of tune vocals aside, the OP, ED and insert songs generally maintain the high standard of the first season. They\u2019re catchy, and well\u2026 very K-On!!-ish. What caught me out though was the meaning they seem to embody. Rather than the lyrics simply being a spontaneous creation (I mean Curry Nochi Rice, what was that all about) they represented something, like Yui\u2019s realization of all the things she took for granted in portrayed in U&I and the girl\u2019s close friendship exemplified through their song for Azusa. In short, K-On!!\u2019s music is great, and that\u2019s all there really is to say about that. (Unless you hate poppy rock, in which case allow me to direct you to the mute button. Seriously, no one\u2019s making you listen to this, get over yourself.)\\n\\n\r\nGuess I better get on to the boring stuff now.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Nothing to write home about, but the smoothness and crispness is certainly pleasing and relaxing to look at, a very good style for a slice-of-life. Animation during the live performances have definitely improved since the first season, which is a definite plus.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Insert songs aside, more often than not there\u2019s always some cutesy background music playing to accompany the scene. While this can easily backfire, KyoAni does a very good job of timing, and fitting the mood with the right music, so this section is also a plus.\\n\\n\r\nVoice Acting:  I was surprised in the first season how such a amateurish band of seiyuu could bring the characters to life. Another season\u2019s gone by and I\u2019m pleased that the quality of VA as remained consistent. Toyosaki Aki\u2019s performance as Yui deserves a special mention, with interchanging voices between cutesy and hoarse, and the constant (if a bit too frequent) \u201cehhh?\u201ds, it was really a joy to listen to. I still maintain that she needs singing lessons though.\\n\\n\r\nSo ultimately, is K-On!! a good anime? Well let me be perfectly honest. I actually wrote this review as a bet against a friend who maintained that it was impossible to write a review for, and I quote, \u201ca cliched intangible blob of moe\u201d. Now to be fair, he may have been right. Maybe I would have found it much easier to just simply cast K-On!! aside as a generic moe-cash in by KyoAni with half decent characterization, no good plot and overall mediocre anime. But as I instead set out to do the impossible task, I was pleasantly surprised when I realized that it was not as impossible as I originally thought. K-On!! is good. Heck, it\u2019s great. It knew exactly what it wanted to be, and set out to achieve it brilliantly (which is more than I can say for Angel Beats). I\u2019d probably go as far as to say it is the best slice-of-life/moe anime of the year. Sure, it probably couldn\u2019t hold a candle to say\u2026 Durarara or FMA:Brotherhood, but you wouldn\u2019t compare K-On!! to those anime for the same reason you wouldn\u2019t ride a goat to an equestrian event or wear a miniskirt to a basketball game. Is K-On!! a good slice-of-life/moe? Yes. Then\u2026 did I enjoy K-On!!? Yes, immensely. Then\u2026 Is K-On!! a good anime? Obvious answer is obvious. So much for generic and mediocrity huh?\\n\\n\r\nI will conclude with this afterthought. I could probably very easily write a long rant about the negatives of vanilla ice cream. I could talk about how bad it is for your health, how expensive and nutrition lacking ice-cream is, or how it is an overrated flavor and too many people eat just because they don\u2019t have the guts to try new and better flavors, or how the ice-cream companies continue to make vanilla ice-cream to cater for those idiotic people, cashing in instead of nobly taking the first step in revolutionizing ice cream flavors. But at the end of the day, it doesn\u2019t change the fact that I like vanilla ice-cream, and that I enjoy having it every Friday night after dinner as I tune in to watch the weekly action flick on television. If I didn\u2019t enjoy vanilla ice-cream, would that change the fact that it\u2019s a good ice-cream? Of course not. You\u2019d be a magnificent retard for declaring vanilla ice-cream is bad just because you don\u2019t like it, so why do some people do it so much for anime like K-On!!? Vanilla ice-cream exists for people who like vanilla ice-cream, just like K-On!! exists for people who like a good slice-of-life with a bit of (or quite a bit of, whatever floats your boat) moe. If there are people who enjoy it, then that should be all that matters, and I think sometimes we\u2019re too easily forgetful of that fact.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading this wall of text.",

            "content": "Things are sometimes more than they seem.\r\nFor any individual, there always are surprises to be found in the long walk of life. Things that initially appear flavorless and dull, but reveal themselves to be something much more colorful. These are the kinds of experiences that impact a person and make them feel something of significance. They may make them laugh or cry, but in the end these are the kinds of stories that hold a special place in one's heart. The second season of K-ON is, for me (and for many), this very experience. \r\nK-ON has always been a very polarizing series, one which hasa dedicated fanbase and a vocal group of people staunchly asserting their hatred of the anime. Regardless of any personal feelings one might hold towards the massive franchise, it's impossible to deny the influence that it's enjoyed these past few years. But unlike so many titles that are successful simply by chance or for manipulating its viewers, KyoAni has painstakingly focused on quality to ensure that K-ON deserves every bit of its fame. \\n\\n\r\nClearly, this is not a complex story. \\n\\n\r\nThis will not challenge your beliefs or ideals, nor give you something to analyze and mull over. It's first and foremost a character-based slice of life revolving around five young girls and their daily lives within their highschool music club. Though reluctant fans and critics of the genre may find themselves irritated by the idealized and cute nature of the series, there is much more value to be found than a cursory glance at the artwork or synopsis might suggest. K-ON is an anime which all groups of people can enjoy- provided that the notion of 'cute girls drinking tea' doesn't make you want to go outside and blow stuff up. \\n\\n\r\nWhile comedy plays the most extensive role in the entertainment of this series, a good portion of the fun comes from the characters and their basic interaction with each other. There's a very interesting dynamic between the main cast and they contrast and play off each other in both comedic and dramatic scenes. The most noteworthy example of this is the relationship between Yui and Azusa: a lazy, ditzy girl alongside her extremely hardworking and strict junior. While there isn't anything especially unique or complex to be found at first, it's a relationship that eventually develops into one that feels genuinely endearing. There are no melodramatic arguments between the two, nor is there only a single moment where their feelings come to light. \\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly, the resulting character development does not subvert this dynamic but instead expands upon it. Azusa still finds herself feeling out-of-place and anxious in regards to the silly behavior of her seniors, while Yui also struggles to take her musicianship more seriously and come across as a figure that Azusa can rely on. A heavy contrast between the two exists as a result, which allows them to gain insight and grow from each other in a way that feels meaningful, while still retaining the inherent nature of their personalities. It's a dynamic that the series focuses on and highlights, and thankfully this aspect is treated with the care that it truly deserves. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, K-ON focuses heavily on the other members of the club as well \u2013 five girls of very different lifestyles and backgrounds coming together and becoming close and inseparable friends. Unlike many slice of life series, this isn't an immediate growth between the cast (sans the long friendship between Ritsu and Mio), but rather a gradual one that builds from each episode. Rather than focus on one specific character each episode, the series is often focused more on their time together as a group. The girls all feel like human beings with personality and purpose, rather than the faceless archetypes that have become a staple of many anime titles. As a result, it becomes very easy to grow attached to the characters and feel like you're along with them for the ride, rather than simply being a mere spectator. \\n\\n\r\nFor an anime to immerse its viewers to such a level \u2013 to allow them to feel like they are there with the cast, is a very special thing. It serves not only to make each moment more meaningful, but to make the experience feel very personal as well. When the tale of the five girls is over, you may find yourself feeling like something important inside of you is now missing. If all the tea and cake leaves you in doubt, this will be the sign of something more. \\n\\n\r\nThe most prevalent theme within the series is that of growing up. They change, they adapt, and they learn to accept their new situation. As graduation draws closer for four of the five girls they deal with the complications of college entrance exams, career choices, and leaving their highschool life behind. Surprisingly, this has the biggest impact not on these characters themselves, but on their junior, Azusa, who feels discontent and uneasy about her friends moving on before her. She struggles with the prospect of managing the club by herself and recruiting new members for after the other girls graduate, an issue that is touched upon many times and eventually resolved towards the end of the series. \\n\\n\r\nIt's this theme which leads to a wide variety of emotional and heartwarming moments in the story. Two preeminent examples include the girls performing in front of the school for a final time and having a tearful realization after, and a final scene where the four girls graduate and play a bittersweet farewell song in the club room for a crying Azusa. I am not ashamed to admit that these two scenes made me tear up.\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings up an interesting point, because if the series were so focused on the girls eating cake and doing nothing each episode, would these kinds of scenes exist in the first place? No. It almost feels like a direct contradiction to the claims of the anime being focused on nothing more than the cuteness of the characters, and while it's impossible to deny its presence in the story, it's quite clear that this is not what the anime is defined by. This is what sets K-ON apart from many of its competitors: being an anime that is not only cute and entertaining, but one that carries emotional impact as well. \\n\\n\r\nIt should also be noted that while the manga is not by any means bad, KyoAni took Kakifly\u2019s very simplistic 4-koma and added an enormous amount of detail to it, taking important plot elements that only existed in a passing line or panel from the manga. The vast majority of the character development and emotional scenes are the work of KyoAni and the talented staff behind the anime, and for taking liberties and improving upon the manga in so many ways they deserve to be applauded and commended. There's an adage about how adaptations are always inferior to the source material, but this is one example that proves it's not always so.  \\n\\n\r\nBut then, where would the series be without the stunning production values that KyoAni is so well known for? \\n\\n\r\nThis is luckily an aspect that is not glanced over or given second thought, and the visuals in K-ON are something that stand out as being absolutely stellar as a result. Almost everything about the characters is fluid and detailed, with movements looking and feeling very much lifelike. Not only do the mouth and limbs move like in most anime, but the hair will move along with the body, the clothes will furrow and crease realistically to the character\u2019s movements, and their eyebrows and facial shape will accentuate their expression. While the girls seldom practice or play music, the scenes where they do play are beautifully animated and show detail that musicians and general viewers will appreciate.  It\u2019s a gorgeous anime to look at and it really reflects the effort that KyoAni put into the series. \\n\\n\r\nMusic itself is much more varied than in the first season, with several times more unique songs that the girls perform together as a band and during the opening and ending sequences. These songs are all performed by the actors behind each character, and, while they certainly aren't amazing pieces of music, they fit perfectly with the tone of the anime and with the musical talent of the girls. They are not professional musicians but rather highschool girls that play and practice for fun, which makes the silly songs that they perform seem all the more realistic and fitting. Of further note is the background music, which is simplistic and sets the atmosphere for each scene very well. \\n\\n\r\nThe second season is a bit of a departure from its predecessor, though, in the sense that the music is not highlighted or given nearly as much focus as it had before. This isn't an anime about music but an anime about a group of friends that happen to play music. They practice and play, discuss musical terminology, and shop for new gear, but this serves more as an aspect of their daily lives rather than something they are invariably focusing on and thinking about. There's definitely enough here to satisfy accomplished and aspiring musicians alike, but it is not the focal point. However, when the series does focus on its musical performances it does a fantastic job, hitting on both the entertainment and emotional level. \"U & I\" is a great example of this, a song written by Yui to show thanks for her sister in a way that she could never express without music.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, K-ON is not some form of \"masterpiece\" or its synonyms. It would be very difficult to find any anime that can genuinely meet that criteria. Rather, K-ON is an exemplary title that showcases what the best of anime really has to offer, both within its genre and universally. It's a title which shows us that a complex plot and deep themes are not required for an anime to truly resonate. \\n\\n\r\nK-ON may not be everybody's cup of tea, but for the girls of Sakuragaoka High School, it is their tea party.",

            "content": "Story:\r\nWhat do you get when you add four cute girlfriends with the desire to form a music band, situational comedy, and every style of moe an otaku can think of? You get K-On! (or kei-on-bu). Just of a group of girls trying to follow their dreams... sounds very cliche' doesn't it? Well it is and this show oozes cliche'. The setting to the sitcom all the way down to the catch phrase onomatopoeia's like kyuun and hyaan. It's very obvious from the start of episode 1, that the story isn't trying to mess with the success of current trends and tries its very best torun with whats popular with the anime crowd.\\n\\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, the set of stories set through each episode are not terrible by any stretch. Its just very \"same old same old.\" If you watch this you'll quickly recognize if you love it hate it after about two episodes. As for me, I love it but can't really feel attached to the storyline considering the amount of parts that are skipped. It almost feels like the show has a bad case of A.D.D. when it skips the important stuff. Trust me, they do it ALOT.\\n\\n\r\nIt skips the important stuff but as they say, the Devil is in the Details. Small things like putting a tongue sideways on a mascot pig azu-nyan, or little piggy sounds from yui, and even the graceful and light footed walking posture of Mugi in that cat costume as she walks in the club room. The icing on the cake is how Azu's buddy gives her a sip of her juice box without even thinking twice. That's what makes this show K-On.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art direction has its high points and its low points, but overall the art can't go a little higher than mediocre. Just observe the op/ed theme songs for the show. Typically, the theme songs have higher production values than the actual show itself. They are indeed better artistically, but it still looks very low quality. Another areas that i could not help but notice in the artwork would be the disproportionate loli scenes and the spaces between their hands. Just look at their feed and you'll see what I'm talking about.\\n\\n\r\nI can't turn down the entire art direction down though, as the style does reflect the manga quite accurately most of the time. But I believe most of the time and effort (and probably money) went in to replicating the girls instruments with their real life counterparts. Mio's vintage lefty Fender-Japan JB62/3TS, Ritsu's Yamaha Hipgig JK6F46MK, Tsumugi's Korg TR76 (which is ~$1300), and Yui's VINTAGE Gibson Les Paul Standard Guitar, are all represented with great painstaking detail. The honey burst colors of the bass and standard guitars, the indentations on the Zildjan cymbals, even the correct amount of knobs and switches on the various Marshall amps (usually the JCM900 is shown the most). They even go far as to showcase even more instrument types throughout various locations like the Sonor Delite Stage 1 drum set in one of the girls summer home. Sadly, the instruments are just mere props that aren't shown in action very often as one would hope in a music-themed anime. But when they are in display, everything else, including the girls, pale in comparison to their details.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nAs usual, sound is the toughest to score, since its either really good or really bad. But typically its really good, so my standards are set much higher than what most would probably do. The voice acting is above average considering today's standards. Any female seiyuu these days can pull off moe moe voices very easily. As like all the other music anime before it, its main selling point is the music and how its integrated into the series. Now if you cant stand J-Pop/Rock then I'm sure you will probably drop this series. Unless you're a moe otaku and in that case, you'll watch this show religiously. But for a 13 episode series, they play just the right amount of songs, and they manage not to keep playing the same song over and over to the point of insanity like Kirarin Revolution did with Bararaika, although they ALMOST do.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe characters are, of course, cute and lovable. Their actions and reactions are all spot on scenes of cute humor. And all the jokes about each other are always sure to bring out a chuckle or two. The chemistry is also a very good mix which proves that the standard 4 B's of personalities (brash, bashful, boorish, and benevolent) can never falter for great story telling.\\n\\n\r\nEverything they see, say, and do is just insanely cute. It might not be of that loli persuasion but its all moe that gradually increases its moe powers even more with every episode. Be that as it may, they are great characters, but they are by no means very original in the character designs. Sadly, I too (as millions of other people have fallen under Mio Akiyama's spell and forced me to give it an 8 out of 10... \\n\\n\r\nSure the characters are cookie cutter moe blobs but beauty is definitely in the details. People who hate this show usually dont sweat the small stuff like that. They just see a group of girls chatting about BS and having fun. Thats fine, that is what a slice of life comedy is all about, having fun. Azunyan pretty much sums up the epic power of the moeblob in episode one when she poses in front of that \"rising sun\". \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI enjoyed the time I spent watching this show. I never felt like this was a waste of time or anything of the sort. Maybe its because I love school comedies or Mio's ability to bring the whole country of Japan (and the world) to its knees. Regardless, its still fun to watch these girls try to get by and reach their goals together. Its obvious as to why such a simple show is appealing to the masses. It has all the right components and the constant bombardment of moe scenes will defintiely make any moe fan's heart flutter. It defintely has its flaws (in some important places) but since it is so short, you get just enough story progression to enjoy it\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Well, what else can I really say about this anime, other than calling it a seed of potential that blossomed into a beautiful anime that made me emotionally attached to the story itself as well as connect to my life? Such gems are rare, and im glad i gave this anime a chance to make me laugh, smile and cry without overdoing the \"moe moe kyun\" factor.\r\nSo where do i start? K-On, initially a, as many people call it, \"fluffy slice of life\" depiction turned from that into what I would personally call a coming of age story, one in which each character is thoroughlyexplored and developed well, and one in which you see them mature since the end of Season 1. But the key here is that kyo-ani didn't overdo it either. So here is my breakdown:\\n\\n\r\nStory (8/10): To be fair, people will dispute me, but in K-On!!, the story is something we all live through in our own realities. When watching this Anime, it reminded me of my days in High School, a place where you not only experienced new opportunities, but grew in maturity, and most importantly, developed memories and friendships that would transcend the years themselves. At first, the tone was lulled, but Im not afraid to say that by the end, the way the story developed made me reminisce my final days, and I too got caught in the emotional moments before the end of the Season. I didn't want it to end, but sometimes, thats what makes the best endings, because you know it ended so wonderfully, and that emotionally you were satisfied. Clannad (After-Story), Kanon, Air, Angel Beats! and now K-On!...Kyo-Ani, you have successfully reeled me in again.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10/10): Has K-On!! improved since the first season? All you need to do is look at the opening theme songs and compare the artwork. Brighter, crisper, smoother, and especially with the live-action scenes, more atmospheric, my eyes were bedazzled by what Kyo-Ani had done, and one can tell they knew how to get their moneys worth from the animation software. Especially with a certain scene in Episode 10 (I think), It was beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10): Absolutely astounding, thats all I can say. Every time a new song played, whether it was the first few minutes of Episode 1, the new Op of GO! GO! Maniac or Utauyo! Miracle or even something as beautiful as U&I or Tenshi ni Fureta yo, nothing disappointed me, I even laughed a little at the lyrics. I remember disliking Yuis voice initially as well, but oh damn, has it grown on me as time gone on, and even Death Devils songs have revived my love for Japanese speed metal. Either way, the songs make up just another reason why I didn't want this season to end, it reminded me of my days on a Fender Bass or my Grand Piano, the two instruments I consider my life and soul.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter Development (9.5/10): The fact that I almost cried at the end of the final few episodes are enough to justify my personal score, because it felt like losing something special to me when i realised the anime was ending so soon, and the manga as well (New manga apparently announced...",

            "content": "Ah K-on!!\r\nI decided to watch this because I had seen the first season and thought I'd watch something I could bash on when it ended, because it's ended now, yes sure, there are two more episodes, but these are just extra helpings of moe for all you fanboys out there.\r\nAt first it was everything I'd expected, it was moe, it was silly, nothing substantial about the anime whatsoever, neither storyboard nor any real screenplay, but then something happened, something that started to happen during the first season yet didn't fully evolve into this feeling I felt after having watched the second season; it grew onme. At this point in time good slice of life anime are a dying breed, atleast for people who aren't fanboys. Everything's been done, producers search desperately for new original ideas, but they're just not there and to tell you the truth K-on!! is not original in any sense, form or colour.  K-on!! shouldn't be good slice of life anime and for me it wasn't exactly good, but it was better than I had expected, it had an atmosphere of coziness, sure sometimes I wanted to smash something when it got excessively moe, but it was cozy, it was homely, the show offers something soothing and if that's what the producers wanted to give their viewers then they've done a pretty good job.\\n\\n\r\nI dislike KyoAni, but they can draw and animate, there is no doubt about it. As for the music, well props to the voice actors and producers for creating an OST it gives a sense of quality and whatever shortcomings K-on!! had, the feeling of quality is tangible. Much like a very, very neatly wrapped present with fancy paper and ribbons and hearts and bunnies and everything else cute you can imagine, yet the content of the present is rather empty. K-on!! will not blow your mind with an innovative storyboard and intriguing screenplay, but it will soothe you, depending on what kind of person you are and for what purpose you watch this show, in one way or another.\\n\\n\r\nTo answer any and all questions or comments that come up after reading this review the correct answer would be; no.",

            "content": "\"Fun things are fun\" \u2013 Hirasawa Yui.\r\nDisclaimer: this is a review of the entire K-On franchise, minor spoilers ahead.\r\nAlmost everybody, including myself at one time, is so narrow-minded when it comes to cute girls doing cute things in cute ways anime, whether we enjoy them or not, that we don't expect anything else than moe, comedy and fan service. In a result, we don't really pay attention to the real quality of this kind of show.\r\nAt first, I saw Keion as an extremely entertaining moeblob series, without being able to explain why. In retrospect, I thought that it started out being a decent one, thatbecame fairly good and even somewhat believable in the late second season. After quite a lot of research and thinking, in addition to a rewatch, I realized that Keion actually has a solid narrative, that characterization and character development are more than satisfying, and that the amount of effort put into details is insane. Don't get me wrong, this isn't Disappearance, it's still a fun series with a high iyashikei potential.\\n\\n\r\nDropping this anime after a couple of episodes, simply because you can't see past the moe and think it's going to be another generic school life for male otakus, is a shame. That was to be expected, though, since KyoAni is well-known for animating stuff like Lucky\u2606Star and The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. Additionally, the original manga was aimed at the type of person mocked by Welcome to the NHK. Moreover and more importantly, the narrative and character development are pretty subtle: you will miss it if you're not attentive, along with tons of cool details, and think that nothing happened.\\n\\n\r\nAs Digibro said, \"this is a story of how each of these girls finds their place in the Light Music Club\". This is the story of their relationship, and ultimately an innocent, adorable and universal story of friendship. Bonus: the second season takes it to a whole new level, but more about that later, I didn't even introduce the characters yet.\\n\\n\r\nThe first episode opens with Yui, a lazy, carefree, and airheaded girl entering high school. Yui, who literally did nothing in her life, struggles to search for a club to join. This brings us to the energetic and careless drummer of the series: Ritsu, who desires to form a band with her childhood friend Mio, a beautiful, shy, reserved and mature bassist. Tsumugi, a gentle and sweet pianist who comes from a rich background and has always dreamed of experiencing a normal rose-colored school life, quickly decides to join their band: the Light Music Club. Later on in the series, the serious guitarist Asuza is struck by the performance of these girls at freshman welcoming ceremony, but doesn't understand their appeal, and ultimately joins it as well. \\n\\n\r\nI'll say it again, dropping this anime after a couple of episodes is a shame. At the end of the first one, it's perfectly understandable if you're skeptical about this show and don't know why you should stick with K-On!, neither Yui knows what to do. She doesn't know what the Light Music Club, \"K-On\" in Japanese, really is about, nor whether she should join it either. While not being astonishing, the beginning makes sense in term of narrative, and Yui could be considered at some level as a metaphor of the viewer, which is pretty nice.\\n\\n\r\nThere is no such thing as cheap and easy way to portray inner thoughts, dilemmas, and emotions in this series. For instance, Yui won't say out of nowhere \"Damn, I just realized that I was being egoist and didn't take guitar seriously, I feel bad for other members.\" with a melodramatic song. It was never stated by any characters: it's up to the audience to understand it. To be honest with you, getting a glimpse of her feelings through her reactions, tones, body language, etc. isn't hard... as long as you're paying attention. I love how this anime is full of this kind of details and subtleties that nobody in the show points out.\\n\\n\r\nIf you have already watched the first season and think badly of it, you might be wondering \"what are you talking about, characters are generic and not developed at all, plus Yui is autistic\". Then as you have already guessed, I'll tell you that you missed lots of meaningful details and subtleties... even though that you aren't completely wrong. This season mostly sets up the characters, their club, and the world they live in. In short, you get the basis of what Keion is. And sadly enough, it's rushed as hell.\\n\\n\r\nIn point of fact, K-On! focuses way more on establishing the setting and on the comedy, than on this franchise's biggest asset: the characters. Their characterization is pretty weak and they hardly ever feel human. At the end of the 13rd episode, while they definitely have changed a little, you won't notice huge differences in their simplistic and moe personality. It's easy yet important to understand how much they love each other and feel comfortable in the Light Music Club, though. The humor is another problem, by frequently feeling cheap and forced (\"Moe Moe Kyun~\"). As for Yui being an airhead autistic savant, it's notably used to show us how incredibly she can get serious for her friends, and of course as a joke.\\n\\n\r\nThe second season improves upon like, everything. From characterization to lighting to animation to direction to comedy to activities. The animation is more lifelike and detailed than ever, colors feel more natural and refined, backgrounds are more realistic, and on and on. While the first season covered two years in only 13 episodes, the second, completed by an OVA plus a movie, benefits from 26 episodes to follow the senior year of Yui, Ritsu, Mio, and Tsumugi. This slow, realistic pace allows to characters way more time to interact naturally with each other, and grow up as people. That's considerable, since while the setting set by the first season was perfectly believable, thanks to the amazing work of Kyoto Animation, characters weren't yet.\\n\\n\r\nVisuals put aside, what really struck me in at the beginning of K-On!! were the changes in nature of humor. This season isn't entertaining solely because of the moe anymore (even though its predecessor had its moments as well), it's amusing because the comedy which involves and relies on cute girls, with their colorful and distinct personality, is genuinely funny. Moe definitely has become an integral part of their characterization, but at the same time, jokes are more mature and sophisticated. For instance, Yui wouldn't have commented on Sawa-chan's love life with a mean undertone in K-On!. It might sound silly, but I think that lots of comedy scenes could only work in this series with these particular characters.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had to describe K-On!! in one word, other than \"fun\", it would be \"healing\" (then \"immersive\", and last but not least \"creative\"). The comedy in Keion has never intended to be over-the-top, nor it should have. Indeed, quite a lot of moments don't aim at making you laugh, KyoAni doesn't force the girls to go out of their personality to make hilarious things happen. While being both, seeing these friends interact with each others and react with various believable situations is often more heartwarming than amusing. You're more likely to find you smiling during the span of an episode and have a good laugh now and then, than dying laughing every minute. Some could argue that Non Non Biyori is better as a relaxing anime, but that would be overlooking the fact that iyashikei is just a part of what makes K-On!! stand out from other moeblob anime.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Asuza could almost be merely defined by \"moe\" at the end of the first season, which left little to no room for character development, she becomes much more human and is given more depth in the second one, at the same time as Yui and the others. The episode where she wonders to what extent her friends influence her, and whether she's still herself, is especially interesting, her relationship with Yui being the key of her development. Being the only underclassman of the Light Music Club, Asuza is going to be left alone by the time the seniors graduate. For the viewers, this season may be all about the dynamic between the characters, but for our lovely girls, this is all about accepting reality and growing up.\\n\\n\r\nDuring the first half of K-On!!, they're too busy to enjoy themselves and making the most of their youth to be concerned about this fact, though. As mentioned before, this season focuses heavily on these five girls interacting with each others. Everyone has experienced a couple of things of what the characters live in the show, from sleeping with friends to studying to graduation. By portraying it in such a realistic yet slightly romanticized and funny way, Keion speaks directly to the heart of viewers. All of these natural interactions and subtle reactions create a deep sense of immersion and ultimately lead to their development.\\n\\n\r\nIn real life, people rarely do a 180\u00b0 in personality from one day to another. They gradually change, grow, evolve. Do not expect a character development like Simon's from Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, but rather few subtle, believable and logical changes in their personality all along the show. Being the pivot in the dramatic progression, Azusa's development is quite special, her attachment to the club and especially toward its members continually growing as graduation is approaching.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of, even though the story ends up mainly resolving around Azusa, the other keion girls have lots of opportunities to grow out of their moe archetypes as well. In a result of being a part of the Light Music Club, even the character with the weakest and most overlooked development, Tsumugi, gradually becomes much more proactive and involved in the life of the club than before. Azusa's personality, development, and conflicted feelings are explored through her interactions with her friends, as well as the other girls, together with few sweet scenes of introspection. All of that naturally leads us to the episode twenty, both climax and payoff of season 2. This episode shows us their last school festival performance, then finally the girls intimately realizing how much they loved their time together, and about graduation.\\n\\n\r\nThe more you connect and become attached to the characters, the more the episode twenty will resonate with you and might become one of your favorite episode of all time (alongside the last battle of Gurren Lagann and the end of The Tatamy Galaxy for my part). Even if you don't care much about these characters, you can still enjoy this episode from a narrative standpoint and for its masterful execution. Along with a stunning animation and great accurate playing, you get a near-to-perfect artistic direction, an amazing sound design, and awesome insert songs. The best part is how Kyoto Animation utilized all of these elements in harmony to create some of the most powerful, emotional, heartbreaking and beautiful scenes I have ever seen, across all mediums. Though a little personal bias might have affected my judgment. I'll say no more but one word about this episode: \"lycopene~\".\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 24, the last one chronologically, and the second climax of the series, made me tear up as well. But again, it is not forced and tearjerking like Jun Maeda's shows (e.g. \"please cry now it's supposed to be a sad scene\" with overblown sad piano and sad violin). These two episodes couldn't have had such an impact on me if this franchise wasn't as I described above. The final arc, with its melancholic atmosphere and tone, is the most logical way to conclude the story given what came before, and thus is the ultimate proof that Keion's narrative makes sense and follows a logical progression.\\n\\n\r\nIt's really important to understand that these episodes don't come out of nowhere. They're so great because of the solid and believable foregoing. To speak only of the graduation, lots of shows make clear of their characters' emotions prematurely (\"oh my god it's our last year together I'll miss you so much... is that sad piano am I hearing? Let's cry!\"). In real life, just like in Keion, people tend to put off this kind of problem and emotions until they no longer can. Not to mention they don't randomly force themselves to talk about it for the pure sake of drama.\\n\\n\r\nSomething Keion does better than most of the shows I've seen, is creating a believable world, a world that feels alive, a world that works on its own. I won't put it on the same level as Cowboy Bebop's world building, but it's still nice to Yui's classmates acting like real people for example. It might feel a little contrived how much everyone cheer for the Light Music Club, though. It's worth mentioning that some recurring side characters, like Yui's sister, Azusa's friend Jun, or Sawa-chan-sensei, are given quite a lot of screentime and a proper treatment. KyoAni's attention to such details helps to build the consistent world I love.\\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, in a result of depicting the daily life of the keion girls with Naoko Yamada's style, this anime is extremely immersive and atmospheric. The complete lack of fanservice contributes significantly to maintaining the suspension of disbelief. While both seasons indeed have scenes with the girls in cute bikini and having reflexions about Mio's or Azusa's chest, they don't exist solely to please the male audience, they're genuinely immersive. You could totally imagine real teenagers wearing this kind of swimsuit and making such friendly mean comments (the few ones in the second season aren't even necessarily explicit, you know, just like in real life). Characters are not sexualized in the least, and the only things that could be considered as cheap fanservice, in its wider meaning, are silly \"moe moe kyun\" jokes from the first season, and Sawa-chan's passion for cute outfits. It's actually quite funny to see the girls' skirts to systematically fall between their legs when they sit down. This is moe at its purest form. That's just how much KyoAni's staff love their work and respect its characters.\\n\\n\r\nOne doesn't have to be an anime veteran to understand the complaints about the lack of creativity of studios when it comes to moe. While Keion doesn't stand out that much in this area, we still should give KyoAni some credit, which definitely get out of their comfort zone in the second season, by not always following the same recipe and trying to keep renewing themselves. Regarding openings, even though I tend to prefer Go! Go! Maniac! to Utauyo!! MIRACLE musically speaking, the last one is really emblematic of what the show has to offer in term of fun and creativity. The latter adjective applies to the legitimately awesome endings as well: Don't say \"lazy\" (the most memorable), Listen! (my favorite), No, Thank You! (the best).\\n\\n\r\nDon't forget Keion is, for the most part, a show about cute girls doing dumb stuff. I am obviously not saying crap like \"at the end it's still just a moeblob anime, it cannot possibly be good\". My aim here is simply to bring to light what this series intended to do and how great the execution is. Being bored by all of these silly characters and lazy afternoons is perfectly understandable, and not the end of the world. Keion may simply not be for you, but hey, there are tons of great shows out of here, just try to keep an open mind.\\n\\n\r\nJust a few words about both OVAs and movie, even though the latter definitely deserves a review on its own. The first OVA takes place after the events of the first season, on the New Year's Eve, and could belong to the second one, with the girls stepping outside of their club and the fun mainly coming from their natural interactions. The second mostly prepares the ground for the movie. Despite being a great condensed version of the second season with truly excelling production values, K-On! Movie is still slightly inferior to the series, in my opinion, the whole being greater than the sum of its parts.\\n\\n\r\nThings are sometimes more than they seem, but at the end, fun things are fun.",

            "content": "Story [9/10]\r\nThe second season is here! I\u2019m surprised how successful this anime is to produce a second season.  0:00 \u2013 2:05 of the first episode blew me away, after watching that part I was thinking: \u201cAlright this is going to be goooooooooood\u201d. Than the opening theme kicks in, and I\u2019m thinking: \u201cOh, man too much is going on here\u201d. Oh, and the rest of the episode is just as wonderful.\r\nArt [10/10]\r\nI can\u2019t tell if there\u2019s improvement on the animation from the first season, but that\u2019s not a bad thing because the animation is just simply gorgeous. The animators really take a lot of pridein their work and put a lot of effort and detail in each scene. In terms of watching an anime for its animation, this is probably the best animation ever created and it really can\u2019t be missed. Your eyes will be blessed with bright brilliant beautiful colours and you\u2019ll be grateful such animators exist.\\n\\n\r\nSound [10/10]\\n\r\nAny movement happening in this anime they\u2019ve got it down. The sound really brings the animation to life along with the characters. From the sound of their footsteps to the sound of the instruments playing is just a privilege for my ears. Recycling the soundtracks from the first season bring you back to the world of K-On!! This is only the first episode, so I\u2019m sure will hear some new tracks. You can\u2019t argue with the voice acting because it\u2019s in Japanese, if it was in English it hurt my ears and turn me off to watching this anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter [9/10]\\n\r\nI cannot watch an anime if the characters aren\u2019t likeable, and these characters are extremely likable.  All the key characters return from the first season of course, the voice acting on each character brings them to life, giving them their own personality. I like all the characters, just picking out my favorites ones are hard. I would have to say my favorite is Mio and Nodoka although she\u2019s a side character and you rarely see her. It\u2019s probably her glasses that stick out.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment [9/10]\\n\r\nWithout a doubt this is an anime for 2010 that cannot be missed, if you haven\u2019t watched the first season, I\u2019d recommend it before watching the new season, because that\u2019s what you do when you watch anime or anything else in general. I guess it would depend on the show or type of movie and this is one of them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall [9/10]\\n\r\nThis is only the first episode of the second season, and I\u2019ve got quite a lot to say.  So, I guess that means it must be that good, huh? I can\u2019t really tell because this was just an improve review for the first episode. I can\u2019t imagine the full review. It would probably be ridiculous, but in a good way. Enjoy!",

            "content": "[~A K-On! casette playing~]\r\nLadies and gentlemen, a review of K-On!! Ahead of you. Hope y'all enjoy.\r\nI'll be reviewing just the one season, not the whole series (although I watched 'em all).\r\nMinor spoilers ahead, I don't think they could offend anyone or anything though.\r\nSo... This anime isn't too great for many people, as they rate is as \"Another kawaii girls series\". Is their opinion right? Of course, it is. I guess everybody is allowed to think positively or negatively about every single series. But yet, it's not another anime about kawaii girls doing kawaii stuff. It has some deeper meanings in its easy plot. I'll betrying to answer some harder questions later, so let's begin with the actual review!\\n\\n\r\nStory - 9 (Great)\\n\\n\r\nAs K-On!! is just about cute girls doing cute things, such as drinking tea or playing music, the story part isn't going to get 10. But, as I've mentioned above, it has some hidden pearls. The friendship is really deep, they're doing almost everything with each other, their lives are based on their friendship really much. Many people would sacrifice their lives just to have such friends, really. In first K-On! their bondings were already beautiful, so you can just think of what they became in the second season. But, you have to remember that the friendship isn't the only part of the story. They also make concerts, learn to important exams with each other, do sleepovers and really many other stuff, yet it's not worth to spoiler more, because you should watch them by yourself!\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10 (Outstanding)\\n\\n\r\nThe art hasn't changed since K-On! ended, so I don't have to tell you anything more. As from what I remember they didn't improve anything, the look of the characters is still beautiful, landscapes are quite nice and it is really satisfying seeing how they animated the guitar moves well. Hats off. Keep in mind that it's still a better offshoot of traditional KyoAni artstyle, also known from e.g. Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuutsu 2009.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9 (Great)\\n\\n\r\nOPs and EDs are awesome. Soundtrack is great, music from concerts is nice. I can't remind myself of any outstanding tracks out of here, but the soundtrack fits well to the genres of K-On series. Of course you can't compare it to any greater work, e.g. Kanye, yet it's quite nice.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10 (Outstanding)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are brilliant. I haven't watched an anime in which I identified with every hero or heroine as I did in K-On!!. They way they're behaving is outstanding - for everyone! We have a stubborn, but friendly and caring Ritsu, intelligent, but scared of everything Mio, cute and generous Mugi, self-possessed and also caring Azusa, and lazy, happy, joyful main heroine - Yui. They all are members of a band named \"Fuwa Fuwa Time\" - as mentioned above, they're doing really many things together. The way they behave hasn't changed since K-On!, yet I feel like they all grew up a bit. Although they act almost the same, something has changed. This part could've also been described as \"boring, repeatable bunch of friends\" - no, no, no. Not like that. They're more than just a bunch of friends. They are a family. If you've watched Clannad After Story, you'll know what I actually mean.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10 (Outstanding)\\n\\n\r\n\"geez ive been crying all the night cause it ended\" - it perfectly says anything about Enjoyment terms. Since its plot is very easy, the characters are different, but wholesome, you don't have to think too much, the art is beuaitful - you can fully enjoy the anime. Not to say, its simplicity is the actual reason why it's so enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10 (Outstanding)\\n\\n\r\nDon't take me wrong, it's not a masterpiece. Despite having a nice story, beautiful art, brilliant characters and one of the best enjoyments ever, it has some issues, e.g. its story isn't that superior and the soundtrack is somehow forgettable. Neverthless, it's a really solid title if you are looking for an anime in which there are some girls that just want to have fun. Of course I gave a lower rating to Story and Sound comparing it to other series, but in case of comparision to similar series K-On is horribly outstanding and rating of Story and Sound is easily 10. (9*2+10*3):5=(18+30):5=9,6 | 9,6\u224810 | 10=10\\n\r\nIt just got what it deserves.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading, hope y'all actually enjoyed this one. Have a nice time watching this!",

            "content": "If I were to come up to you and ask if you would watch a show about 5 high school girls drinking tea and having fun, chances are you'd back away slowly and begin to either call the police or whip out the pepper spray or taser. Where's the action, the romance, the suspense? Is there even a storyline? A plot? A movie critic would probably burst into tears at the anti-Hollywood-like characteristics of this horrendous \"TV show?\" \r\nWell I have braved the troubled waters of slice-of-life to come before this golden nugget among others: K-On! To dispense some of the hate and malice, letme assure you, I had almost no hopes for this show at all. When introduced to season 1, I was skeptical and a little paranoid. My thought process was: this is going to be one big suck. Of terribleness. Of all time. There was nothing more that I wanted to do than watch 4 or 5 high school girls sip tea and experience the trivialities of life. Especially when I'm inundated with school work and up to my chest in thing-to-do. (Can you taste the sarcasm?). But this show blew me far away into the zone of no return.\\n\\n\r\nI loved this show. Regardless of its pointless plot, useless storyline, girly characters and circular reasonings, I managed to come out laughing and even sharing this little anime. Though the title implies music, maybe 3 or 4 episodes ever had any musical playing in it. That didn't matter! K-On sucked you into the useless plot faster than you could struggle away. It's like quicksand, I tell you! \\n\\n\r\nThough there is lots of skepticism and controversy regarding the show's enjoyment, let me introduce you to one of the biggest critics out there: me. I thought nothing wasted more time than watching garbage like this. I adamantly refused to observe material of this quality; I felt like this was a waste of time. But lo and behold, the characters sort of stick to you, more than the mochi they frequently talked about. No, what kept me rigged with attention were the characters and situations themselves. \\n\\n\r\nThe tone remained static almost the entire time; the last episode, however, became oddly serious and really sad. Actually, the last couple of episodes clamped down, as if the director and producer had a meeting and wanted to go out with a bang. And a bang they did. You become so emotionally attached to the each character's traits and personality, the last episode feels like a bittersweet moment: happy for the girls, yet sad to see them move on with their artificial and fantasy life. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves remained lovable and enjoyable. They were intimate, yet had almost no arguments. They had an everlasting friendship bond, yet seemed never to be angry; they joked often and never were reprimanded. The most trouble any of the girls got into was when one of them made a bad joke. But of course, each character had their own traits.\\n\\n\r\n Ritsu, the leader and drummer of the group, was brash, bold and brave, often going out of her way to annoy or pester Mio. She is a rough-and-tumble sort of girl, taking life as it comes, often forgetting her responsibilities (such as renting the auditorium for them to perform!) and leading the group from place to place. She plays the drums, wears a headband and is proud of her salient forehead  Mio was the quiet, shy girl, with moe characteristics, insecurities, clumsiness, easily terrified sort of way, yet mild-headed to all except Ritsu, her close childhood friend whom Mio often hits in retaliation to Ritsu's teasing. She plays the bass, that she named Elizabeth, has long black hair and is heavily self-conscious about her looks. Mugi is a rich, loyal, fun-loving sort of person, who seems never to enjoy the small things in life, like an arcade. She plays the piano, and makes the tea and brings the food for their daily afternoon tea time. Yui is an airhead, but a lovable one nonetheless. She enjoyed food much more than the others, picks up music really fast, and is easily distracted. She plays the guitar (she named Gitah), has short brown hair, and the story usually revolves around her. Asuza (Azu-Nyan, as they tend to call her) is a small girl, one year younger, with long black hair who plays the guitar. She is quick-witted, often tries to get practice together but fails frequently. \\n\\n\r\nUi, Yui's sister, is the antithesis of Yui. She is responsible, loving in a parent sort of way, and cares for Yui often throughout the series. Jun is a friend of Ui and Asuza, but she seems more selfish and is jealous of the light music club.\\n\\n\r\nThe art work is stunning. The attention to detail is enormous - if you pause at any scene, try to look for hidden detail: the chips and holes in the desk, the way the guitar pegs are drawn, the way light bounces of key parts of their instruments, the way they play their instruments is all drawn to the exact detail. I do play both the guitar and piano, and I could actually follow along with Yui and Mugi's parts when their fingers were shown. I was very impressed by the detail. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is also similarly impressive. The songs were kind and carefree, not too serious, yet had difficult parts for all the instruments. Though they did play relatively few songs, not to mention very few new ones, they had an aura of happiness that makes one want to spring up and dance for no particular reason. The OP and ED are fantastic and well-made - I never skipped them, even though I'm pressed for time sometimes. The OP was always upbeat and led you wanting more - the ED was much more serious and carried more weight, as if to tell you that K-ON was done for the day.\\n\\n\r\nThe story. Oh, how the story is the center of all this controversy! Alas, how little it is understood! If you were tasked to make this anime, what would you do different? Would you instead have the girls be in class all day, then perhaps play their instruments and go home? NO!! The viewers would swoon from boredom and tedium. Though many argue that the story is not a story, but pointless little synopsis's of their daily routine, I say, well, of COURSE IT IS. School is boring! What more to make it fun than to add a little twist - a comedic tone underlying small substories! Absolute genius. This was the heart and core of the anime; or as Yui says, the heart of the cake is the strawberry! \\n\\n\r\nOverall, it was enjoyable to say the least. Though there were no serious performances, and probably none of this would ever happen in real life, I still loved every bit of this sweet and delicious cake, followed by some afternoon tea. Though it may not seem like much, by the end, you will almost miss their daily tea time; it becomes ingrained into your head. Parting with this anime was bittersweet: Houkago Tea Time, rock on! Remember: FUWA FUWA TIME!",

            "content": "I don't know why I like K-On!!, but I do. It's one of those shows that features nothing you're normally interested in, but you just can't help but enjoy the atmosphere of the group. People watch slice of life shows because they love involving themselves mentally in the story. So, the basic definition of a good slice of life show is one where you'd want to be a part of it. This is what K-On's done so well.\r\nStory: 5 high school girls have formed a band with the resolution to play at \"Budokan!\" A large music fest. The story in K-On!! moreso just follows thegirls around their high school activities though. Going on field trips, hanging out after school, eating tea and cake =3. It's all very slice of life. I don't really feel the need to bring up the moe aspect of the show. A show is good or bad on it's own merit, not on how it archetypes it's characters. Granted, that obviously has a role to play, but with the \"cute girls doing cute things\" factor aside, you just enjoy everyone's personalities as they are.\\n\\n\r\nArt: K-On!! is very well animated. The art style is very soft, in that everyone is designed to look younger than your avg. anime character of the same age. But I guess that's moe, I dunno, I don't normally watch moe shows. What I particularly like though, is the detailing in the outlines of characters. The way they've animated things has this eye-catching effect about it. Very good animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound: K-On's background soundtrack has that sort of fun loose feeling that gets you in the mood to watch a show full of fluff. This is really key, because actual background music and sound effects are often ignored in reviews and sometimes even in actual production, and it's these shows that usually aren't as entertaining. K-On!! has a soothing quality just like the tea they famously drink. No matter what mood you start an episode in, by the end you'll feel relaxed because of how the soundtrack has influenced you. The only funny thing to note is the opening's hyperactive singing really throws you off to the overall mood of the show. The end does a nice job of livening things up. Overall, the animation quality in both makes them very interesting AMV's in their own right, as have all K-On OP's and ED's, and you'll end up loving them with repeated exposure. Just like Justin Bieber... Oh god, I can't even jokingly finish that sentence. JB is the worst thing to happen to the eardrums since Spice Girls.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on...\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Ah the K-On Cast. It's very interesting to see how Yui has developed since the beginning of the first season. Everyone is still very much the same, but Yui is definitely more energetic than in the past. Ritsu has grown a little more responsible, Mio, a little less shy, and Mugi... well Mugi gets experience in the outside world. Azusa develops as well, though you wouldn't notice any of this without really reflecting on it. I suppose that's the moe bogging it down. But genuinely, there's actually a lot of character development that goes on in this show, and it happens so seamlessly you wouldn't even notice. That's good writing in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Though this season has far less emphasis on the music, what little you hear of the songs is still just as addicting as anything else. You'll find yourself watching this show, caught up in the slice o' life aspect, and you won't mind one bit. It's the sort of thing you can watch either 1 episode, or several, and the overall impact will still be the same. K-On's highly enjoyable. I would parrot the notion that never was K-On!! in any way made to market to a more adult fan base. It's rather refreshing (especially after just watching HOTD).\\n\\n\r\nOverall, K-On!!'s a great series, and I would say you're probably fine to watch season 2 without having seen season 1, but I wouldn't recommend it, simply because you'll want more K-On fun at the end, and the only bits you'll get to see are events that have already transpired.\\n\\n\r\nThat's K-On. It wasn't revolutionary or incredible, but it was surprisingly very good. And this is coming from someone completely outside the moe fan base.",

            "content": "K-on!! Is somewhat hard to review, so this will probably a short one. \r\nStory: The very first thing that you will notice about K-on!! Is its lack of a story. There is plot for every episode, but most of the time it\u2019s just a comedic skit which shows the daily life of the members of the light music club. There really isn\u2019t much to talk about in terms of the story, which is really surprising considering the popularity of the series. I would give it a 6/10 because it just lacks a solid plot.\r\nArt: The art is great, as expected of KyoAni. The animation wassuperb, the art was solid and pretty much everything is perfect. One thing I would like to mention is the moe-ness(is this even a word?) of the anime, which is one of the main selling points of the anime. If you\u2019re a fan of moe animes, you will most certainly love this. I gave it a 9/10 for being well-animated, but that is to be expected considering that they also animated clannad, The melancholy of haruhi suzumiya and other great animes.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Considering that this is an anime that focuses on a music club, it is quite obvious that the sounds are very good. The voice acting was done well, the background music was perfect but the thing i liked the most are the songs, which is another one of its main selling points. They are light and have a certain charm, very different from most of the crap we hear today and for that I would give it a 10/10. FuwaFuwa all the way!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:  The characters are all loveable and have certain unique qualities that separate them from other characters. But because K-on!! doesn\u2019t have much of a story, there isn\u2019t much character development either. The only character with much character development is Azunyan, who from a somewhat serious character turns into a more laid back and cheerful girl. But even if there isn\u2019t any character development, it can also be said that there isn\u2019t any need for development, since the characters are already perfect and for that, I would give it an 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: The thing that makes K-on!! an amazing anime is that even with a lack of a story, it still manages to entertain its viewers, and pretty well on that matter. Its light-hearted theme and original jokes make people come back for more. It\u2019s the kind of anime that relies purely on entertaining its viewers to keep them watching, and they have succeeded on that matter. I really have no idea on how they kept it fresh; it could be the comedy, the cuteness, or the music but either way, they really did a good job on entertaining me and i\u2019m sure that it will entertain you to. For that I give it a 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give it an 8/10 because even though it is entertaining, it lacks something that makes animes exciting: a story. Though it kept me watching, it loses some of its charm after a while but it is still one of the best animes out there.\\n\\n\r\nRemember when i said this would be a short review? Well I lied :p If you have read through the entire review then i would like to thank you :)) if there are any mistakes in my grammar then srry because English is not my first language.\\n",

All the memories of happiness and feelings fill up a treasure box. The lasting days in the lives of the K-On!! girls is a golden collection asking to be embraced. And I will embrace them. Always.\r\nWhile I absolutely adored the cake eating and lazing around aspect in the first season, this season took a solid shift that presented the series into a great slice-of-life. It wasn't limited to their club room only, and these five cute stars embarked on a branching set of activities from schooltrips to concerts where they interacted adorably with precious friendship. No matter where they are, there's never a dull moment with them around. Just look at the cuteception. They're even self-aware of their own cuteness! These characters have a special quality to them other than their entertaining personalities. From the family bond as sisters or the relationship they had with their teacher, an aura is formed where every soul who stumbled upon it will form an attachment. So, as graduation is nearing, the club members have to realize that they must move on with the next stage of their life. And to move along with a strong friendship that will last for eternity. All the fun times and the silly times they had, these are the memories that held the evidence that their bonds are true. That closeness, which was formed in the realm of simple day-to-day interactions, was a purity that described a genuine friendship. Every moments were meaningful. Every moments activated my attachment. Every time, they never failed to place a smile on my face.\\n\\n\r\nUnder the windows of their treasured club room, the rays of a warm and setting afternoon light glazes over the best friends. Backed up by a soothing melody, they cherished the time they had spent together after a spectacular run of their last ever high school performance. This was a heartwarming scene and if not for the audiovisual talents from Kyoto Animation, it wouldn't had become such a special scene that permeated with joyous and sad emotions. The amount of efforts put in by them was something that I appreciated. The visual captured all kinds of tone hanging in the air. Those googly eyes that gazed all the way through my kokoro switched on my affectionate side. The energy-driven animation expressed the character's personality without the need for narrative techniques effectively. And then there was the soft lighting that spoke on so many levels, mostly to radiate positivity. All these made the small moments into something more meaningful, because there were some fine feelings hidden beneath the realistic colors. Another aspect behind the visual was in the sound and their relaxing sensation can be felt without disturbing the lighthearted interactions of the characters. Each one of the seiyuus acted out their roles with a cute tone. Performed by them as well, the songs played during the club performance were fun to listen to. Some of the songs also embodied a deeper meaning in the lyrics so hearing these filled me up with even more emotions as they performed together as a close group.\\n\\n\r\nK-On!! is an anime for U&I. Every time I watch an episode, I know that I will no doubt feel happiness. And I'm sure you too can feel that same happiness. We all can become a piece of this memory and preserve it. Wouldn't that be the perfect treasure?",

            "content": "Yamada Naoko is a director that I have been interested for a while. Female directors are kind of a rare breed, and because of that I find her films to be interesting in a way that it gives a different perspective. But that's not all, she herself is a live-action fanatic. Not just animation, but live-action. She's basically the kind of personnel that Hideaki Anno (Director of Evangelion) is hoping to find more of in the animation industry. This is also the reason why Kyoto Animation shows are so interesting. \r\n\"It depends on what kind of a film it would be. Unlike live action, withanimation we have to simplify the real world. Women tend to be more realistic and manage day-to-day lives very well. Men on the other hand tend to be more idealistic \u2013 and fantasy films need that idealistic approach.\"\\n\\n\r\n^\\n\r\n||\\n\\n\r\nMight explain why most Kyoto Animation shows are SoL.\\n\\n\r\nK-ON is not idealistic. K-ON is realistic. Especially in the highschool girls department. In other words, it doesn't have to have this grandiose plot that most seem to seek of. Its grandiosity is its simplicity. K-ON is a show about friendship. It is a show about how different people can change different people. The characters are multi-faceted. Basically, they are treated in the show as real people not as characters. In a way that they react differently to different things. They don't go out of their way to deliver the jokes or add drama. They all follow in this logical sense of personality.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIs K-ON about \"music\"?\\n\\n\r\nNo, K-ON is not about music, it's about being in a band. A band is a group of people making music, and that's what K-ON is about. A group of people. \\n\\n\\n\r\nK-ON doesn't have a plot....\\n\\n\r\n\"Plot refers to the sequence of events inside a story which affect other events through the principle of cause and effect.\" -Wikipedia\\n\\n\r\nK-ON does indeed have a plot in a way that it has a cause (the formation of the club) and effect (characters evolution and attachment at the end of the series). But I think what matter the most is the execution of the premise. K-ON's premise can be summed up in two words, tea time. But the way it executes on those initial ideas, and expand on them for the rest of the show is fucking excellent. By the end of the series, tea time pretty much means their lives to them. And the fact that it is ending is akin to death. Episode 20 will destroy you without realizing it. I myself never knew that I was so attached to these girls subconsciously, until it was getting near the end. It was emotional, it was gripping, it was the probably the greatest scene I have experienced in all of anime. It was a fuwa fuwa time.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTo summarize, what makes K-ON so fucking good, is that it is a coalescence of small details that all pack up into this big package of emotion. The more you watch it, the more you'll love it.",

            "content": "I dislike how autistic they've made Yui in K-On!! as compared to the first series.\r\nI put that first because honestly it's my biggest gripe, and I figure it will trigger some people. It first hit me six or seven episodes in, like \"oh my god, Yui is autistic!\" and after that realization I could never get over my shift in perspective. In the first series, Yui was a ditzy, airheaded girl who was still a brilliant musician, and brought the band together. In the second, she's a barely-functioning autist whose friends do nothing but enable her. I mean, this girl clearly needs psychiatric assistance, butinstead all the supporting characters just let her be without steering her in a healthy manner. The biggest crime with Yui is that she magically still gets good grades and is great at guitar; unfortunately, like other movies/shows that deal with the spectrum, it's not a \"savant\" plot device, it just comes across as blind luck or even a superpower that isn't explained.\\n\\n\r\nThat aside, the tone shift is way too much for me. At least two-thirds of the episodes have some serious melodrama as opposed to the first series' consistent carefree attitude. Honestly, it's depressing. More than that, it's unrelatable. I know I'm a grown adult with almost half my life between high school and where I'm at now, but the way K-On!! mixes up all these feels with the end of high school (which drags out for half a dozen episodes at least) is so alien to me. The high school setting wasn't an issue in the first series because it was simply a canvas for the characters to be painted on; here, it's a large focus much to its detriment. \\n\\n\r\nLast, K-On!! is twice as long as it needs to be. I have no issue with an entire series being devoted to their third year, but it did not need to be 24 episodes + 2 OVAs (and a film that I might get around to). There should have been a third series that dealt with the break between high school and university, or even better just on university. Barring that, it should have just been halved and ended.\\n\\n\r\nAll the same and excepting what I mentioned above, the characters are still great, the animation is very addicting, and, obviously, the music is sensational (and very catchy!). I just really wish the producers didn't change so much and instead focused on maintaining a happy, cheerful atmosphere without all the high school drama. Oh well.",

            "content": "This review will encompass the K-On franchise as a whole.\r\nIntroduction: When I decided to watch K-On, I wasn\u2019t expecting much. I had seen the memes of the main character, Yui Hirasawa and her friends acting cute and bumming around. I had heard that K-On was the phenomenon that popularized the concept of \u201cmoe\u201d in anime and spread its influence further, corrupting the modern industry, and giving it its odd infatuation with the premise of \u201ccute girls doing cute things\u201d, something that has had an iron grip on anime as a whole as of late. While I personally do not hold great disdain for this \u201cgenre\u201d- if you will - I will admit that I\u2019m not the biggest fan of it and would rather watch an anime that centres around character development and a deep, entrancing story. Now, why did I start to watch K-On? The answer is rather simple; I wanted a show that was filled to the brim with happiness after I completed the rather depressing anime known as Paranoia Agent. What I got instead was an anime that was very bitter-sweet, and filled with characters that I personally cared about. \\n\\n\r\nStory (9/10): If one were to take K-On\u2019s story at face value, it would not be interesting in the slightest. It\u2019s been done countless of times before. A student who had just entered high school joins an odd club and establishes friendships that last her a lifetime. This kind of story has been etched into our collective consciousness, and whenever we sit down to watch anime that holds this premise, we can foresee the development of its plot points far before they actually unfold on the screen before us. However, the strength of K-On\u2019s story does not lay in its cliche premise, but rather in its heartfelt execution. Unlike many high-school dramas, K-On follows its characters as they grow and mature (or not) over the course of their three years in school. During this period of time, we watch as Yui Hirasawa, originally an unmotivated girl on a collision course with a NEET lifestyle, grow talented in music, and we see her create eternal bonds with her fellow club members. The denizens of the Light Music Club face everyday issues such as exams and concerts, but the most harrowing of these issues is the problem of growing up. And this fact of life is the central theme of K-On\u2019s story, and it is a theme that is seldom touched upon in slice-of-life anime. We all experience growing old, the separation from childhood friends, and the eventual acceptance that our youthful innocence and naivety does not last forever. As such, K-On\u2019s story is immediately relatable. The emotions of the girls in the Light Music Club are conveyed with such realism as they confront with this inevitable reality, and it is genuinely heart-breaking as we watch with them contend with this issue. I can confidently say that the latter half of K-On is one of the most bitter sweet moments in anime, period. It evoked more emotions in me than notorious sad anime such as Clannad and Your Lie in April because the characters were relatable, but I\u2019ll get to that in the next section. On a side note, K-On\u2019s humour is top-notch and certainly evoked at least a chuckle or two from me each episode. I also applaud K-On for not relying on fanservice for its humour. That is extremely rare for an anime with an all-female cast, so kudos to them.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters(8/10): K-On\u2019s characters are generally what one would expect from a slice-of-life anime involving cute girls and music. Yui Hirasawa is your classic airhead who delights in eating sweets all day and gawking at cute things. Ritsu Tainaka is the boyish (and forgetful) drummer who takes great satisfaction in teasing her friends and playing relatively harmless pranks around the school. Mio Akiyama is the bassist for the band, and despite her best efforts to maintain a cool exterior, on the inside she is very fearful and shy. Tsumugi Kotobuki is the keyboardist and ditzy member of the band. She grew up rich, and is ignorant to many of the customs of common folk. Finally, we have Azusa Nakano, who is the youngest of the band, and yet she is also the most strict. From this brief summary, one can surmise that K-On\u2019s characters aren\u2019t exactly original. That is true, though, the greatest impact of K-On\u2019s characters is how human they feel. When we see a snapshot of their daily lives in each episode, we feel as if we are right alongside them as they partake in their antics. Almost every main character feels realistically like a person you would meet on the street, each with their own quirks, strengths and weaknesses. While Yui may be an airhead and probably a victim of ADD, she works hard when it counts and cares deeply for her friends. Ritsu may appear to be a unintelligent jerk from the outside, but in reality she holds deep affection for her friends and she succeeds when it counts. Mio is very smart and beautiful, though she suffers greatly from anxiety, and despite this, she tries again and again to fight it so that she may play on stage without fear. Azusa is strong-willed and is very skilled at guitar, and yet she has such a great attachment to her seniors that it is almost damaging to her psyche, and so she does everything she can to cope with their inevitable graduation. Unfortunately, I could not find any substantial flaws in Tsumugi\u2019s character. She succeeds at everything, she is beautiful, and she is talented. I hate to say it, but Tsumugi is very well the Mary-Sue of this story. Whether that is intentional or not, I cannot say. Nonetheless, she is a likeable character all the same.\\n\\n\r\nArt(9/10): K-On is beautifully animated, no questions asked. The backgrounds are bright and full of colour. The school is well defined as a location. The main characters are all well designed, and their appearances are memorable. K-On\u2019s animation shines the brightest during the scenes when the girls are playing their instruments. Every character\u2019s finger movements match up to the beat of the music, which is especially thrilling when you see Yui or Azusa\u2019s fingers on their guitar strings match the fast-paced grooves of the song they\u2019re playing. All in all, there is not much to complain about when it comes to K-On\u2019s animation, except for some minor nitpicking. Some character faces do look the same but with different hair, and many of the background characters are dull and not very interesting. The artstyle does get a substantial upgrade in the movie, however. London is beautifully animated, and the characters themselves are very crisp and pleasing to the eye. The best part about the animation in the movie, in my opinion, is how each character\u2019s facial expressions are greatly defined. They really bring out each character\u2019s personality and help convey their reactions to the events unfolding around them with fantastic detail. \\n\\n\r\nSound(8/10): The music of K-On is perhaps the most controversial section of the anime. I\u2019ll begin with the stock background music. It fits each scene, though it is not particularly memorable and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll go back to listen to the anime\u2019s soundtrack anytime soon. Next up, the openings and endings. I found the opening from season one and the first opening of season two to be catchy and enjoyable, but unfortunately, the opening for the second half of season two was a tad ear-grating and I did end up continually skipping it after I heard it for the first time. All three endings were just find, though I did not listen to them more than once each. The main cast\u2019s seiyuu all did fantastic work and beautifully captured their respective character\u2019s emotions and mannerisms, which in turn made them feel even more alive alongside the exceptional writing. Nodoka\u2019s seiyuu could\u2019ve used some work, as her voice cracked now and again, but that\u2019s very minor. And now, onto the main songs he bands played. Overall, I enjoyed them. I found them all to be fun to listen to, and one track in particular at the end of the series is a real tear-jerker. Yui\u2019s voice fits the tone of each song, and I did not find her voice to be irritating at all.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10): Every episode of K-On was hands-down fun to watch. I loved the story, character interactions, and seeing how the story of the Light Music Club would progress. It was touching to see the characters age over the course of their high school years, and how they would eventually come to terms with growing old. As I watched K-On, I really grew attached to this lovable cast of characters because their issues were relatable and very human. K-On is one of the few anime that is able to make me laugh and cry from beginning to end.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: Behind K-On\u2019s seemingly cliche exterior lays a surprisingly poignant story about growing up and coming to terms with the fact that nothing lasts forever. Alongside a bright artstyle, rockin\u2019 music, and memorable characters, K-On is one anime you\u2019ll surely remember for years to come. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:  8.8/10\\n",

            "content": "What do you get when you mix: Moe, Music, Slice of Life, Comedy and A little Drama. You get K-ON!!, the masterpiece made by the great Kakifly. This review will cover Seasons 1 and 2 and the Music from the series.\r\nStory: 9/10. The story is pretty normal, four girls start a band in their first year of high school and it shows their life as they go through high school playing music or just having fun. The story is very basic which have been used before in other Anime's but \u201cK-ON!!\u201d is one of the ones that actually do it right and pull it offperfectly. Season 1 focuses more on the music side of the coin while Season 2 focuses more of the Slice of Life genre.\\n\\n\r\nArt: -/- I don\u2019t rate for art because it is not a deciding factor on how I watch Anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 100/10. This is where \u201cK-ON!\u201d excels beyond any other Anime that I have seen. The series start out with Cageyake! GIRLS, it is a very weird opening but grows on you and you end up singing along to it in the end. Then there is Don't Say \u201cLazy\u201d the first ending theme, which is a techno rock song which is very amazing. I really liked how the made the openings. The first is always sung by Yui and the Ending is always sung by Mio. I know at first its hard to get used to Yui singing but it grows on you. \\n\\n\r\nNext is GO! GO! MANIAC, really fast song, it is my least favorite of the three opening but it still is really good. Listen!! is the second opening, which is really done well and is on par with Don't Say Lazy's greatness. I love the keybored in and the vocals. Mio proves once again, she is the bomb. \\n\\n\r\nThen here come the last two OP/ED's of \u201cK-ON!!\u201d...Utauyo! MIRACLE and No, Thank You. Probably the greatest op/ed combo ever. Utauyo is still my favorite oping in the entire series because its so much fun to sing along too and just epic. This is where Yui shines like Takuto Tsunashi's Galaxy. No, Thank You is the greatest ending theme ever period bar none. It is perfect, I cant find anything bad to say about it.\\n\\n\r\nAs for insert songs we have:\\n\r\nFuwa Fuwa Time (I love playing this song in my car with the windows down on full blast lol its awesome, Mio does the best job on this song.)\\n\r\nMy Love is a Stapler (very catchy and fun)\\n\r\nCalligraphy Pen ~Ballpoint Pen~ (Mio does the best on this song so listen to her version. This one is also very catchy and is one that I could see playing at dances)\\n\r\nPure Pure Heart (Probably the weakest out of all the insert songs, but it still is very good. It is just the one with the least plays on my iPod.)\\n\r\nGohan wa Okazu (This song is so much fun, it is my favorite out of all the insert song. This song is so like Yui, it defines her to a T. If I was in a band I would play this song because its just so much fun and hilarious.)\\n\r\nU&I (My second favorite insert song, the lyrics are perfect and have great meaning. It was the perfect ending song to their last festival. It gave me chills.)\\n\r\nTenshi ni Fureta yo! (This song was done so perfectly, and was so sad. 1. Because it was the last song of the series 2. the lyrics were all about Azu-nyan and it was sad seeing Azu-nyan cry while they played it. Beautiful song, perfect ending to the series)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10 Here's another place where \u201cK-ON!!\u201d excels. The main characters are really memorable and have good development throughout the series. Mio is the quiet, extremely shy, yet the most mature out of the group. Yui is the lazy, cute, spaced out and lazy member of the group (She reminds me a bit of Osaka from Azumanga but is more lazy and less spaced out.) Mugi is the rich girl who has no street smarts and it very impressed by everything people do. Ritchan is the crazy wild girl who always stirs up trouble. Azu-nyan is the one that is always pushing the group to practice and is really good at playing the guitar, she ends up even teaching Yui when she joins the group. I might as well mention Sawa-chan, their adviser. She was hilarious when she first showed up and is the metal head/cosplayer of the group. She always tries to dress up everyone in cute, moe outfits. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall 10/10. I love this series, it will always be in my Top 5. The music in it is legend and  everything else makes up the series is amazing. If your a fan of Music and Slice of Life, this Anime is for you. If your not into that, then this show is not for you. But, it won't hurt just to try it out, you just might like it.",

            "content": "When thinking of K-On! as a series, a few words may come to mind. Whether it be happy, cheery, moe, simple or maybe even mind-numbing, K-On!! will always be one of my favorites. \r\nK-On! itself is a slice of life show, there's no getting around that. The daily lives of the girls part of a music club in their High School. When labelled as a slice of life show, the stigma of a nonexistent or shoddy plot is almost always attributed with those shows. However K-On!'s plot over the course of two seasons may seem excessively simple at first, but as one begins to headinto the later portions of the second season and look back upon the journey, there are definitely lessons to be learned and messages to be discovered. \\n\\n\r\nStory (8/10): The second season of K-On!! covers the final year of high school for the four founders of the Light Music club. If you count the first season, the story progression covers all the high school years of the club, and so coming into the final year, there is added weight to the thought that \"this is it\". It's the final year. The season takes advantage of that plot device and slowly but surely instills the premise of graduation and moving on. While graduation itself is not a very original concept, there was something very novel about watching the characters' deal with the concept of not having a next year to look forward to. There are a fair share of the moments that were cherished in season one filled with hilarity and light-heartedness, but towards the end there are sentimental and slightly sad feelings (although they're never really melodramatic or pushed upon you). This offered as a good balance to the very polarizingly happy-go-lucky style of show that season one was, and it was a great way to instill some great ideas that I'll go into later on in the review. \\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10): Kyoto Animation is known for being slick in their animation and reliably creative in their character designs. That being said, K-On!! is visually appealing, as it relies on bright and warm colors and the animation never falls behind either. That being said, it's nothing mind blowing and that's perfectly acceptable for slice of life. Your eyes will be treated however, the a plethora of different cakes, teas and snacks. All in all, the art within K-On!! is suitable for the series and the characters, never hindering it but at the same time, not really boosting it to any higher than it needs to be. In other words, it's just right. \\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10): K-On!! is labelled as a music anime, and it contains the songs that are created and performed by Ritsu, Mugi, Mio, Yui and Azusa. The songs almost never disappoint, filled with guitar and drums and innocent lyrics that are oddly captivating. Although some may be disappointed by the lack of music in every episode, it still offers to be a pleasant treat whenever they do have a performance or whenever the audience is witness to a new song. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9/10): Both seasons of K-On! rely heavily on the interactions and personalities of the characters as most slice of life shows generally do. The characters are generally simple, but they do come with their own unique attributes and enthusiasms as well as their \"problems\" that they have to deal with (note this is a very relaxed show so it's nothing jaw dropping in terms of problems). They do silly things all the time and if you enjoyed the first season there's no reason that you won't enjoy most of the second season. Later on when the mood shifts a bit, you see sides in the characters that you didn't really see too much previously. It was very interesting to see their development as their high school years came to an end, and some of the concepts they had to come to face with. \\n\\n\r\nEffect *minor spoiler?* (9/10): In this section I will outline what I felt were some of the themes that I picked up on throughout the second season. Towards the end of the second half of the second season, the concept of graduation dawns upon the four girls who started up the club. With this concepts comes a few lessons to be learned. The coming of age idea has been used throughout anime and media for a very long time. Growing up and/or moving on to a different stage of your life is something very compelling and interesting. However many other shows seem to deal with this as a battle of conflicts, whether internal or external that break the characters and reforge them anew into their new developed status. K-On!! has it's share of low key \"conflict\" but it takes on a very different perspective on that idea of moving on. The show demonstrates what it means to have a fulfilling \"childhood\",in this case high school career. It shows the importance of making good memories and having a great time while you can so that however many years down the road you can look back and smile, knowing that you didn't regret anything and that you had a blast. It also covers something important as in the theme of passing the torch, and leaving a legacy. The girls who started the club quickly realize that their days are numbered in high school so they try their best to make sure that their work is not only remembered but continued. Moments such as taking the stage for the very last time carry special weight in the second season and you can feel it. Instead of creating turmoil and drama in the group, the writers decided to take the 4koma that K-On!! was and display a story of happiness, even if a big obstacle like moving on presented itself. It warms the heart from the core and shows the girls rejoicing and laughing till the very end knowing that they dreamed big (going for the Budokan) and at the very least if they fell short that they fell short laughing and daring greatly. And that through their actions, they inspired the ones before them as their legacy was cemented. As K-On!! concluded, it was a story of a group of girls who joined an outdated and unpopular club, with no real expectations and big dreams of reaching the Budokan. It was a story about how those girls had fulfilling and joyous moments throughout their journey, and it really didn't matter if they never achieved that dream because the memories they made along the way could never have a price put on them. It was a story of the four girls who walked off after graduating happy and content, being bid adieu by their fans and entrusting their legacy in the hands of those who would replace them. It was the story of the girls that never stopped laughing, eating cake and drinking tea because nothing could take them away from each other and their precious moments. It was the story that grabbed my heart and never let go, securing itself deep inside never to be forgotten. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10): This is one of the shows that I can say I very thoroughly enjoyed. I came for the relaxed and joyous mood that the first season presented but I stayed for the lessons of the second season and the opportunity to look back in awe of their accomplishments. Not much about K-On!! is overly blown up or exaggerated, it's a very humble story of a school club band. But the feelings that it left behind surely were not to be underplayed or unrecognized. K-On!!'s unique and cheery take on moving on will surely never leave me, as I enjoyed it to the very end. It kept me interested, it made me laugh, it made me sad but most of all it made me happy that I stuck with it till the very sweet end. Their journey was worth all that cake, all that tea and all that effort. Hokago Tea Time may have never been the same after Ritsu, Mugi, Mio and Yui graduated, but you can still find them playing and singing joyously until they can't play or sing anymore; in the hearts of those who were touched by their legacy and the hearts of fans of the show across the world. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10): Not the most complicated show, but a heartwarming masterpiece.",

            "content": "Under the glaring eyes of the public masses, the K-On series is predominantly a show about five moe girls who do nothing but drink tea and eat cakes. While this is certainly true, there's something profound that lies beyond the reach of naked eye.\r\nPlease bear with me here as I explain why people view this show so negatively \u2014 I'll make it worth your while.\r\nMost people overlook K-On due to its lack of substance and proper character development. Unfortunately, this is true \u2014 the story contains little to no significant conflicts that lead to a noticeable change in most, if not any, of the characters.The characters also lack major inspiration and represent common archetypes in the slice of life/moe genre.\\n\\n\r\nAnother major point that people often bring up is the lack of music. Instead of conducting practices, looking for ways to improve, and holding amazing concerts with memorable music, the five members of the Light Music Club instead sit around drinking tea and eating confectioneries all day long. On the off chance that the club does decide to play music, the songs, while good, are not too different from common J-Pop songs and their chord progressions. No one particular song stands out as \"amazing\", and the lyrics are regrettably childish.\\n\\n\r\nHOWEVER...what most people fail to realize is that it is because of this particular lack of complexity that K-On really shines.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot doesn't try to be a Steins;Gate. The drama doesn't try to be a CLANNAD ~AFTER STORY~. The music doesn't try to be a Beck. The list goes on and on, but the point is, relative to the epic nature that many shows (even slice of life shows such as Toradora!) try to achieve, K-On is quite normal.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot merely revolves around a group of five girls living a (relatively) normal and peaceful high school life. The Light Music Club was actually never about playing in Budokan or even playing good music at all. Music was simply a shared interest, a coincidence, even (considering how the characters all came to met in the first season) that brought about a pleasant bundle of memories and experiences that further consolidated their friendships with one another.\\n\\n\r\n(S1 Mini-Spoiler) A scene during the first season that perfectly encapsulates this theme is when Azusa (the youngest of the club) first joins the club. She notes that while the Light Music Club plays lackluster music fraught with countless mistakes, there's something undeniably compelling about the way that they played that she couldn't pull herself away from.\\n\\n\r\nThus, the very selling point of K-On as an anime is its normality. Through its normality, K-On beautifully portrays the importance of friendship and its value over fame and/or materialistic gain. This theme becomes ever so evident as the idea of graduation draws nearer and nearer with each passing moment. Although this is something I'd like to discuss in greater detail, in fear of stepping on a spoiler landmine, I'll avoid doing so.\\n\\n\r\nNow that that's all done and over with, let's discuss the more simple joys and fun to be had in the show.\\n\\n\r\nAs expected of KyoAni, the animation of the show is done very well. The characters achieve exactly what they are meant to achieve as a part of the moe genre \u2014 they're cute. Although this may turn some people off, there is no denying the fact that the show does exactly what it is called to do.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I found the finer points of the animation to be present in something else. All/most of the instruments shown throughout the series are based off of real life models (albeit not named for obvious reasons), and the animation within the music sequences are executed to a high degree of detail.\\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, real life references such as the Natsu-Fes allowed me to pick up more information about Japanese culture, something I take great joy in doing (similar to how Oreimo sheds some light on Comiket and the otaku culture). As a fellow musician, I greatly appreciated this high attention to detail and made the anime just that much more enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nAt this point in time, it may sound like I'm singing this show's praises, since there are quite a few to be had. Nevertheless, K-On is not without its flaws.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot, despite containing such a good theme, has slightly twisted pacing due to the existence of the first season. The first season rushes through the first two years of high school in a mere twelve episodes, while the second season expands the final year (Japan only has three) over a course of twenty-four episodes (and a few specials). Although this isn't a major problem, it would have been preferable to see more consistency to the pacing of the plot over the course of both seasons.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedic element in the show is also somewhat iffy. While it is good that the comedy is always placed at the appropriate time and with a good frequency (not overwhelming, not lacking), a small number of jokes became a little too repetitive for my own enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION:\\n\\n\r\nThis review has sort of been all over the place, so I'll neatly bring my review to an end with the next few paragraphs. However, my following scores may surprise you, so I hope you're patient enough to read this until the very end.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY (10%) \u2014 4.7/10\\n\\n\r\nAt this point, you'll be wondering why I touted the profundity of the themes present in the story and only gave it such a low score. This is because I believe that the discovery of themes is highly subjective and is all a part of your own PERSONAL enjoyment. The story of K-On is, in itself, quite bland. However, as I have said, it doesn't have to be, which is why it is only worth 10% of the overall score.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS (15%) \u2014 4.9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe same reasoning for the story above applies here as well. The characters, by themselves, lack development (individually or collectively) and are typical tropes found within the slice of life/moe genre. That having been said, the characters are not the meat of the show and thus also are only worth 10% of the overall score. It receives a higher score than the story because despite being clich\u00e9, they are still respectable models of what moe characters should be like, and their interactions with one another are enjoyable to watch and well executed enough to consolidate the idea of friendship.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION (20%) \u2014 7.6/10\\n\\n\r\nThere's not much to be said here. Kyoto Animation matches and surpasses expectations. They not only succeeded in drawing cute/moe characters that fit their equally cute/moe personalities, but also paid great attention to detail when it came to instruments or music sequences, something that should appeal to other musicians.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (25%) \u2014 7.7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe reasoning for STORY and CHARACTERS applies here for the final time, but not to the same extent. Not much of the BGM from the OST was memorable, and the insert songs performed by the main characters were infrequent and not too uncommon (in relation to J-Pop). The lyrics of such songs are also too outlandish for conventional enjoyment. The openings and endings are well animated sequences with music that very well fit the hyperactive tone of the show.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT (30%) \u2014 8.3/10\\n\\n\r\nNow, to those who are still confused by rather contradictory grading style, let me explain it in full detail here. I believe that the art of reviewing is an unavoidably subjective attempt to objectify the subjective; in consequence, this means that my review is not the absolute truth out there. It is merely a personal attempt to express my opinions on a particular form of media.\\n\\n\r\nHence, even if I say that the plot only merits a 4.8/10, people can feel free to disagree with me, click the \"Not Helpful\" button, and merrily move on with their lives. I'm merely stating that in relation to other anime that I've seen, K-On does not have a compelling plot or enticing characters, but that I placed little emphasis on these two aspects while I was watching the show. If you are a person who is a heavily plot or character driven individual, then I'm merely trying to make clear that this may not be the show for you.\\n\\n\r\nNow...with that out of the way...\\n\\n\r\nDespite the flaws, I still enjoyed the hell out of this show. The themes that I perceived from the series seemed very profound, particularly because my graduation from high school was only two months ago. References to culture and music were admirable, the cute/rapid/erratic nature of the characters were thoroughly enjoyable, and the innocent performances were catchy, to say the very least.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL (100%) \u2014 7.1/10\\n\\n\r\nK-On is definitely not a show for everyone to enjoy, much like this review. Those who place significant emphasis on heavy plot, complex characters (and specifically their development), and deep music won't get as much out of the show as I did. The show's main appeal is its cute, wacky, sweet nature...and perhaps even its diversity of confectioneries.\\n\\n\r\nSo pour yourself a cup of tea and get ready for the relaxed, fluffy splendor that is K-On.",

            "content": "I had a smile on my face the entire time of watching this.\r\nI know there's people who say that this series has too much \"moe\" but honestly, I feel that it's the best blend of cute and serious when it needs to be. \r\nThe story is about four seniors in high school who are close to graduation. They are in a small club called the Light Music Club, and are joined with another girl named Azuza. The five of them make up the LMC. Over the progression of the show you get to hear the differences in their music performance, and you really get tosee the slice of life in action. While the story is very simple, it holds a lot of emotion and spontaneous action that really makes this show all the more interesting. There's only so much you can put into an anime about five high school girls that are in a music club. And they really do put just enough content to make the story as a whole, great.\\n\\n\r\nI'm a huge fan of the music and art that this anime has. I love all of the OP's and have all of them stuck in my head for days after hearing them. The art style is what you would expect from this studio, excellence. There's not a single time I was let down with what I was seeing.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the biggest highlight of this show. They all have such a good vibe to them, and make me want to watch the show more, even if I was bored during one scene or the next. The really interesting thing that this anime does is it's spontaneous nature. The characters seem to have a really nice flow with what they say and do. You could see them sitting at their table drinking tea, then all of a sudden you will see something out of the ordinary happen. The characters are very impromptu. I really liked how they showed more of Mugi, since the first season she was kinda in the background for the most part. And I really like how they switched the view more to Azuza toward the end of the season; how she saw everything unfold slowly as the graduation came to a close. All of the characters have very interesting backgrounds and personalities that are like-able. Yui may be a bit over the top sometimes, but the rest are, like I said, a perfect blend of cute and serious when need be.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime is a trip. I have a real connection with the characters and I really do relate with this show even on a personal level. I just graduated myself and to see this happen again for characters that I have come to love, it's definitely a new view to how graduation should be. I also would love to say that the music scene in this anime is really alive. I love all of the attention to detail that they put in. Specially using real-life brand names like Yamaha. It's even more fun since I make some music too.\\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend this anime to anyone that wants a show they can sit back and relax to, while having a good smile and some laughs. Ignore the people who say that this show is \"moe trash\" and just respect it for what it has to offer. It's truly a great show.",

            "content": "Over the few years or so, it\u2019s been increasingly apparent that watching anything associated with moe is to be treated with the same sort of caution as doing yoga, or making origami. Generally you\u2019d do all three in the privacy of your own room, preferably with the lights dimed down and curtains tightly shut. (I am speaking of course, mainly for guys).\r\nYes there is much shame to be had in admitting you enjoy watching K-On!!, because who in their right mind would enjoy a plotless moeblob slice-of-life show over say\u2026 the testosterone filled battle epic TTGL? Certainly no one would admit to such an atrociousact to their friends face to face, (or anything less than a distance of 100 miles and 2 computer screens for that matter). Hence it becomes extremely hard to be objective when posed with the question, \u2018Is K-On!! a good anime?\u2019, because all of our social preservation instincts scream \u201crun away!\u201d, while somewhere deep in the soft side of our hearts, something keeps us rooted to our chair and our eyes on our displays.\\n\r\n(Unless you factor in the anonymity of the internet of course, in which case, proudly declaring that K-On!! is awesome and giving it a 9/10 is A-O-K.)\\n\\n\r\nJokes aside though, in recent times I feel that too much anime are being categorized based on if they have any moe elements in them. While there\u2019s nothing wrong with giving labeling an anime as containing moe, it unfairly depicts certain anime as catering towards the niche otaku audience and suggests it\u2019s lack of depth and unoriginality, which in many cases simply isn\u2019t true. Take Lucky Star for example. Who\u2019s to say that it was just a mindless moeblob?\\n\\n\r\nAnyway I had a review here somewhere\u2026 I would go as far as to say that I love the slice-of-life genre. Honey & Clover (which I maintain is more slice-of-life than romance) and Aria remain firmly at my number 1 and 2 spot. For a great slice-of-life, there are a number of criteria that one needs to fill, but the simplest and most important is that every episode should end with you feeling relaxed and contented with a smile on your face. Does K-On!! achieve this? Yes, absolutely 100% yes.\\n\\n\r\nK-On!! follows a relatively frugal format in terms of storyline. You wouldn\u2019t go into each episode expecting anything dramatic or exhilarating, and for some this may be what they like to call boring. But then again, you wouldn\u2019t open a bag of chips expecting M&Ms and chocolate fudge, so why you go into K-On!! expecting anything even resembling a continuous plot? K-On!!\u2019s style single episodic scenarios work greatly in it\u2019s favor, viewers are never startled with annoying cliffhangers or feel an obligation to keep up with it in fear of missing out on some important plot element. If watching K-On!! becomes a chore (I\u2019m looking at you Bleach manga), then it\u2019s missed the point completely, and in this regard, I give K-On!!\u2019s \u2018plot\u2019 two thumbs up.\\n\\n\r\nDespite this though, K-On!! deals with some surprisingly deep themes that would go right over the heads of most casual viewers. One definite improvement from it\u2019s first season is the branching out of the limited focus of club practice (eating cake) to wider array of activities. Granted, most of them are still obvious and predictable, the sort of been-there done-that stories we\u2019ve all seen before, but the shift allowed K-On!! to focus on many different aspects and resort less to what I like to call \u2018moe-moments\u2019 in order to fill up the 24 minutes. Lets face it, how many different ways can you eat, drink and procrastinate before it starts getting old? Instead though, from the summer trips to school plays to the air conditioning campaigns, K-On!! moves away from the same-ness of cake/tea/practice/more cake in the first season and closer to true slice-of-life.\\n\\n\r\nK-On!!\u2019s real brilliance shines in the final 6-7 episodes or so, as the girls neared the finale of their school life, the realization that their after school tea times can\u2019t last forever hits them quietly and their are faced with the challenges of change and the future. Though not exactly compelling and dramatic, it nevertheless teaches us that our beloved peaceful times cannot always last forever, which only makes them more precious, not unlike Aria the Origination, but on a smaller scale. K-On!\u2019s main idea was a carefree life of daily cake, tea and music with not a worry in the world, but K-On!!\u2019s step away from that ultimately paid off and turned what would have been just a mediocre moeblob into a great slice-of-life.\\n\\n\r\nI supposed I\u2019d better tackle the moe problem, as it seems to be the main issue dragging K-On!! down. Yes, there is a lot of it. Yes, it gets annoying. Yes, it is overused and detracts from the overall effect. Would K-On!! be better without it? Probably. But then it wouldn\u2019t be K-On!!. Yes you can all come and egg my house afterwards for using such a cliche argument, but there is some wisdom in my words, ladies and gentlemen. As much as we all hate to admit it, moe has become an integral part of the characterization of the K-On!! girls. Yui simply wouldn\u2019t believe the same if she didn\u2019t drool over Azu-nyan or cake, Azu-nyan wouldn\u2019t be the same if she didn\u2019t get embarrassed over every little thing and Mugi simply can\u2019t exist without her air-headed-ness and cheerfulness. Sure, they could do without it, but then they\u2019d be different characters completely. Big Macs would probably taste better with tomato sauce instead of mayo, but then they wouldn\u2019t be Big Macs anymore, if you get what I mean. Even though I make better tasting burgers myself, I wouldn\u2019t want to have Big Macs any other way.\\n\\n\r\nAnd to be fair, a lot of the moe-hate stem from people who watch 3-4 episodes, drop it, and then go complain about it on forums. As I followed K-On!! throughout it\u2019s season, I was quietly surprised as the moe-moments gradually thinned out little by little. It was as if as the girls grew older, the show slowly matured along with them. Don\u2019t believe me? Well, don\u2019t my word for it, see for yourself. Right now. Open up say episode 2 or 3, count how many moe-moments there are, and then compare them to a later episode, say, 21 or something. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not going anywhere so take your time\u2026 Ok\u2026 done? See? Good. Anyway as I was saying, the gradual fade of moe was was subtle and barely noticeable, but for those paying attention it was a nice touch, and went along well with the tone of bittersweetness of the end of their high school lives.\\n\\n\r\nI guess it\u2019ll be wrong to not comment on the music of K-On!! seeing as how that was kinda the whole theme that they were going for. Honestly speaking, it really isn\u2019t half bad. Toyosaki Aki (Yui)\u2019s cute but horrendous out of tune vocals aside, the OP, ED and insert songs generally maintain the high standard of the first season. They\u2019re catchy, and well\u2026 very K-On!!-ish. What caught me out though was the meaning they seem to embody. Rather than the lyrics simply being a spontaneous creation (I mean Curry Nochi Rice, what was that all about) they represented something, like Yui\u2019s realization of all the things she took for granted in portrayed in U&I and the girl\u2019s close friendship exemplified through their song for Azusa. In short, K-On!!\u2019s music is great, and that\u2019s all there really is to say about that. (Unless you hate poppy rock, in which case allow me to direct you to the mute button. Seriously, no one\u2019s making you listen to this, get over yourself.)\\n\\n\r\nGuess I better get on to the boring stuff now.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Nothing to write home about, but the smoothness and crispness is certainly pleasing and relaxing to look at, a very good style for a slice-of-life. Animation during the live performances have definitely improved since the first season, which is a definite plus.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Insert songs aside, more often than not there\u2019s always some cutesy background music playing to accompany the scene. While this can easily backfire, KyoAni does a very good job of timing, and fitting the mood with the right music, so this section is also a plus.\\n\\n\r\nVoice Acting:  I was surprised in the first season how such a amateurish band of seiyuu could bring the characters to life. Another season\u2019s gone by and I\u2019m pleased that the quality of VA as remained consistent. Toyosaki Aki\u2019s performance as Yui deserves a special mention, with interchanging voices between cutesy and hoarse, and the constant (if a bit too frequent) \u201cehhh?\u201ds, it was really a joy to listen to. I still maintain that she needs singing lessons though.\\n\\n\r\nSo ultimately, is K-On!! a good anime? Well let me be perfectly honest. I actually wrote this review as a bet against a friend who maintained that it was impossible to write a review for, and I quote, \u201ca cliched intangible blob of moe\u201d. Now to be fair, he may have been right. Maybe I would have found it much easier to just simply cast K-On!! aside as a generic moe-cash in by KyoAni with half decent characterization, no good plot and overall mediocre anime. But as I instead set out to do the impossible task, I was pleasantly surprised when I realized that it was not as impossible as I originally thought. K-On!! is good. Heck, it\u2019s great. It knew exactly what it wanted to be, and set out to achieve it brilliantly (which is more than I can say for Angel Beats). I\u2019d probably go as far as to say it is the best slice-of-life/moe anime of the year. Sure, it probably couldn\u2019t hold a candle to say\u2026 Durarara or FMA:Brotherhood, but you wouldn\u2019t compare K-On!! to those anime for the same reason you wouldn\u2019t ride a goat to an equestrian event or wear a miniskirt to a basketball game. Is K-On!! a good slice-of-life/moe? Yes. Then\u2026 did I enjoy K-On!!? Yes, immensely. Then\u2026 Is K-On!! a good anime? Obvious answer is obvious. So much for generic and mediocrity huh?\\n\\n\r\nI will conclude with this afterthought. I could probably very easily write a long rant about the negatives of vanilla ice cream. I could talk about how bad it is for your health, how expensive and nutrition lacking ice-cream is, or how it is an overrated flavor and too many people eat just because they don\u2019t have the guts to try new and better flavors, or how the ice-cream companies continue to make vanilla ice-cream to cater for those idiotic people, cashing in instead of nobly taking the first step in revolutionizing ice cream flavors. But at the end of the day, it doesn\u2019t change the fact that I like vanilla ice-cream, and that I enjoy having it every Friday night after dinner as I tune in to watch the weekly action flick on television. If I didn\u2019t enjoy vanilla ice-cream, would that change the fact that it\u2019s a good ice-cream? Of course not. You\u2019d be a magnificent retard for declaring vanilla ice-cream is bad just because you don\u2019t like it, so why do some people do it so much for anime like K-On!!? Vanilla ice-cream exists for people who like vanilla ice-cream, just like K-On!! exists for people who like a good slice-of-life with a bit of (or quite a bit of, whatever floats your boat) moe. If there are people who enjoy it, then that should be all that matters, and I think sometimes we\u2019re too easily forgetful of that fact.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading this wall of text.",

            "content": "Things are sometimes more than they seem.\r\nFor any individual, there always are surprises to be found in the long walk of life. Things that initially appear flavorless and dull, but reveal themselves to be something much more colorful. These are the kinds of experiences that impact a person and make them feel something of significance. They may make them laugh or cry, but in the end these are the kinds of stories that hold a special place in one's heart. The second season of K-ON is, for me (and for many), this very experience. \r\nK-ON has always been a very polarizing series, one which hasa dedicated fanbase and a vocal group of people staunchly asserting their hatred of the anime. Regardless of any personal feelings one might hold towards the massive franchise, it's impossible to deny the influence that it's enjoyed these past few years. But unlike so many titles that are successful simply by chance or for manipulating its viewers, KyoAni has painstakingly focused on quality to ensure that K-ON deserves every bit of its fame. \\n\\n\r\nClearly, this is not a complex story. \\n\\n\r\nThis will not challenge your beliefs or ideals, nor give you something to analyze and mull over. It's first and foremost a character-based slice of life revolving around five young girls and their daily lives within their highschool music club. Though reluctant fans and critics of the genre may find themselves irritated by the idealized and cute nature of the series, there is much more value to be found than a cursory glance at the artwork or synopsis might suggest. K-ON is an anime which all groups of people can enjoy- provided that the notion of 'cute girls drinking tea' doesn't make you want to go outside and blow stuff up. \\n\\n\r\nWhile comedy plays the most extensive role in the entertainment of this series, a good portion of the fun comes from the characters and their basic interaction with each other. There's a very interesting dynamic between the main cast and they contrast and play off each other in both comedic and dramatic scenes. The most noteworthy example of this is the relationship between Yui and Azusa: a lazy, ditzy girl alongside her extremely hardworking and strict junior. While there isn't anything especially unique or complex to be found at first, it's a relationship that eventually develops into one that feels genuinely endearing. There are no melodramatic arguments between the two, nor is there only a single moment where their feelings come to light. \\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly, the resulting character development does not subvert this dynamic but instead expands upon it. Azusa still finds herself feeling out-of-place and anxious in regards to the silly behavior of her seniors, while Yui also struggles to take her musicianship more seriously and come across as a figure that Azusa can rely on. A heavy contrast between the two exists as a result, which allows them to gain insight and grow from each other in a way that feels meaningful, while still retaining the inherent nature of their personalities. It's a dynamic that the series focuses on and highlights, and thankfully this aspect is treated with the care that it truly deserves. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, K-ON focuses heavily on the other members of the club as well \u2013 five girls of very different lifestyles and backgrounds coming together and becoming close and inseparable friends. Unlike many slice of life series, this isn't an immediate growth between the cast (sans the long friendship between Ritsu and Mio), but rather a gradual one that builds from each episode. Rather than focus on one specific character each episode, the series is often focused more on their time together as a group. The girls all feel like human beings with personality and purpose, rather than the faceless archetypes that have become a staple of many anime titles. As a result, it becomes very easy to grow attached to the characters and feel like you're along with them for the ride, rather than simply being a mere spectator. \\n\\n\r\nFor an anime to immerse its viewers to such a level \u2013 to allow them to feel like they are there with the cast, is a very special thing. It serves not only to make each moment more meaningful, but to make the experience feel very personal as well. When the tale of the five girls is over, you may find yourself feeling like something important inside of you is now missing. If all the tea and cake leaves you in doubt, this will be the sign of something more. \\n\\n\r\nThe most prevalent theme within the series is that of growing up. They change, they adapt, and they learn to accept their new situation. As graduation draws closer for four of the five girls they deal with the complications of college entrance exams, career choices, and leaving their highschool life behind. Surprisingly, this has the biggest impact not on these characters themselves, but on their junior, Azusa, who feels discontent and uneasy about her friends moving on before her. She struggles with the prospect of managing the club by herself and recruiting new members for after the other girls graduate, an issue that is touched upon many times and eventually resolved towards the end of the series. \\n\\n\r\nIt's this theme which leads to a wide variety of emotional and heartwarming moments in the story. Two preeminent examples include the girls performing in front of the school for a final time and having a tearful realization after, and a final scene where the four girls graduate and play a bittersweet farewell song in the club room for a crying Azusa. I am not ashamed to admit that these two scenes made me tear up.\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings up an interesting point, because if the series were so focused on the girls eating cake and doing nothing each episode, would these kinds of scenes exist in the first place? No. It almost feels like a direct contradiction to the claims of the anime being focused on nothing more than the cuteness of the characters, and while it's impossible to deny its presence in the story, it's quite clear that this is not what the anime is defined by. This is what sets K-ON apart from many of its competitors: being an anime that is not only cute and entertaining, but one that carries emotional impact as well. \\n\\n\r\nIt should also be noted that while the manga is not by any means bad, KyoAni took Kakifly\u2019s very simplistic 4-koma and added an enormous amount of detail to it, taking important plot elements that only existed in a passing line or panel from the manga. The vast majority of the character development and emotional scenes are the work of KyoAni and the talented staff behind the anime, and for taking liberties and improving upon the manga in so many ways they deserve to be applauded and commended. There's an adage about how adaptations are always inferior to the source material, but this is one example that proves it's not always so.  \\n\\n\r\nBut then, where would the series be without the stunning production values that KyoAni is so well known for? \\n\\n\r\nThis is luckily an aspect that is not glanced over or given second thought, and the visuals in K-ON are something that stand out as being absolutely stellar as a result. Almost everything about the characters is fluid and detailed, with movements looking and feeling very much lifelike. Not only do the mouth and limbs move like in most anime, but the hair will move along with the body, the clothes will furrow and crease realistically to the character\u2019s movements, and their eyebrows and facial shape will accentuate their expression. While the girls seldom practice or play music, the scenes where they do play are beautifully animated and show detail that musicians and general viewers will appreciate.  It\u2019s a gorgeous anime to look at and it really reflects the effort that KyoAni put into the series. \\n\\n\r\nMusic itself is much more varied than in the first season, with several times more unique songs that the girls perform together as a band and during the opening and ending sequences. These songs are all performed by the actors behind each character, and, while they certainly aren't amazing pieces of music, they fit perfectly with the tone of the anime and with the musical talent of the girls. They are not professional musicians but rather highschool girls that play and practice for fun, which makes the silly songs that they perform seem all the more realistic and fitting. Of further note is the background music, which is simplistic and sets the atmosphere for each scene very well. \\n\\n\r\nThe second season is a bit of a departure from its predecessor, though, in the sense that the music is not highlighted or given nearly as much focus as it had before. This isn't an anime about music but an anime about a group of friends that happen to play music. They practice and play, discuss musical terminology, and shop for new gear, but this serves more as an aspect of their daily lives rather than something they are invariably focusing on and thinking about. There's definitely enough here to satisfy accomplished and aspiring musicians alike, but it is not the focal point. However, when the series does focus on its musical performances it does a fantastic job, hitting on both the entertainment and emotional level. \"U & I\" is a great example of this, a song written by Yui to show thanks for her sister in a way that she could never express without music.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, K-ON is not some form of \"masterpiece\" or its synonyms. It would be very difficult to find any anime that can genuinely meet that criteria. Rather, K-ON is an exemplary title that showcases what the best of anime really has to offer, both within its genre and universally. It's a title which shows us that a complex plot and deep themes are not required for an anime to truly resonate. \\n\\n\r\nK-ON may not be everybody's cup of tea, but for the girls of Sakuragaoka High School, it is their tea party.",

            "content": "Story:\r\nWhat do you get when you add four cute girlfriends with the desire to form a music band, situational comedy, and every style of moe an otaku can think of? You get K-On! (or kei-on-bu). Just of a group of girls trying to follow their dreams... sounds very cliche' doesn't it? Well it is and this show oozes cliche'. The setting to the sitcom all the way down to the catch phrase onomatopoeia's like kyuun and hyaan. It's very obvious from the start of episode 1, that the story isn't trying to mess with the success of current trends and tries its very best torun with whats popular with the anime crowd.\\n\\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, the set of stories set through each episode are not terrible by any stretch. Its just very \"same old same old.\" If you watch this you'll quickly recognize if you love it hate it after about two episodes. As for me, I love it but can't really feel attached to the storyline considering the amount of parts that are skipped. It almost feels like the show has a bad case of A.D.D. when it skips the important stuff. Trust me, they do it ALOT.\\n\\n\r\nIt skips the important stuff but as they say, the Devil is in the Details. Small things like putting a tongue sideways on a mascot pig azu-nyan, or little piggy sounds from yui, and even the graceful and light footed walking posture of Mugi in that cat costume as she walks in the club room. The icing on the cake is how Azu's buddy gives her a sip of her juice box without even thinking twice. That's what makes this show K-On.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art direction has its high points and its low points, but overall the art can't go a little higher than mediocre. Just observe the op/ed theme songs for the show. Typically, the theme songs have higher production values than the actual show itself. They are indeed better artistically, but it still looks very low quality. Another areas that i could not help but notice in the artwork would be the disproportionate loli scenes and the spaces between their hands. Just look at their feed and you'll see what I'm talking about.\\n\\n\r\nI can't turn down the entire art direction down though, as the style does reflect the manga quite accurately most of the time. But I believe most of the time and effort (and probably money) went in to replicating the girls instruments with their real life counterparts. Mio's vintage lefty Fender-Japan JB62/3TS, Ritsu's Yamaha Hipgig JK6F46MK, Tsumugi's Korg TR76 (which is ~$1300), and Yui's VINTAGE Gibson Les Paul Standard Guitar, are all represented with great painstaking detail. The honey burst colors of the bass and standard guitars, the indentations on the Zildjan cymbals, even the correct amount of knobs and switches on the various Marshall amps (usually the JCM900 is shown the most). They even go far as to showcase even more instrument types throughout various locations like the Sonor Delite Stage 1 drum set in one of the girls summer home. Sadly, the instruments are just mere props that aren't shown in action very often as one would hope in a music-themed anime. But when they are in display, everything else, including the girls, pale in comparison to their details.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nAs usual, sound is the toughest to score, since its either really good or really bad. But typically its really good, so my standards are set much higher than what most would probably do. The voice acting is above average considering today's standards. Any female seiyuu these days can pull off moe moe voices very easily. As like all the other music anime before it, its main selling point is the music and how its integrated into the series. Now if you cant stand J-Pop/Rock then I'm sure you will probably drop this series. Unless you're a moe otaku and in that case, you'll watch this show religiously. But for a 13 episode series, they play just the right amount of songs, and they manage not to keep playing the same song over and over to the point of insanity like Kirarin Revolution did with Bararaika, although they ALMOST do.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe characters are, of course, cute and lovable. Their actions and reactions are all spot on scenes of cute humor. And all the jokes about each other are always sure to bring out a chuckle or two. The chemistry is also a very good mix which proves that the standard 4 B's of personalities (brash, bashful, boorish, and benevolent) can never falter for great story telling.\\n\\n\r\nEverything they see, say, and do is just insanely cute. It might not be of that loli persuasion but its all moe that gradually increases its moe powers even more with every episode. Be that as it may, they are great characters, but they are by no means very original in the character designs. Sadly, I too (as millions of other people have fallen under Mio Akiyama's spell and forced me to give it an 8 out of 10... \\n\\n\r\nSure the characters are cookie cutter moe blobs but beauty is definitely in the details. People who hate this show usually dont sweat the small stuff like that. They just see a group of girls chatting about BS and having fun. Thats fine, that is what a slice of life comedy is all about, having fun. Azunyan pretty much sums up the epic power of the moeblob in episode one when she poses in front of that \"rising sun\". \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI enjoyed the time I spent watching this show. I never felt like this was a waste of time or anything of the sort. Maybe its because I love school comedies or Mio's ability to bring the whole country of Japan (and the world) to its knees. Regardless, its still fun to watch these girls try to get by and reach their goals together. Its obvious as to why such a simple show is appealing to the masses. It has all the right components and the constant bombardment of moe scenes will defintiely make any moe fan's heart flutter. It defintely has its flaws (in some important places) but since it is so short, you get just enough story progression to enjoy it\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Well, what else can I really say about this anime, other than calling it a seed of potential that blossomed into a beautiful anime that made me emotionally attached to the story itself as well as connect to my life? Such gems are rare, and im glad i gave this anime a chance to make me laugh, smile and cry without overdoing the \"moe moe kyun\" factor.\r\nSo where do i start? K-On, initially a, as many people call it, \"fluffy slice of life\" depiction turned from that into what I would personally call a coming of age story, one in which each character is thoroughlyexplored and developed well, and one in which you see them mature since the end of Season 1. But the key here is that kyo-ani didn't overdo it either. So here is my breakdown:\\n\\n\r\nStory (8/10): To be fair, people will dispute me, but in K-On!!, the story is something we all live through in our own realities. When watching this Anime, it reminded me of my days in High School, a place where you not only experienced new opportunities, but grew in maturity, and most importantly, developed memories and friendships that would transcend the years themselves. At first, the tone was lulled, but Im not afraid to say that by the end, the way the story developed made me reminisce my final days, and I too got caught in the emotional moments before the end of the Season. I didn't want it to end, but sometimes, thats what makes the best endings, because you know it ended so wonderfully, and that emotionally you were satisfied. Clannad (After-Story), Kanon, Air, Angel Beats! and now K-On!...Kyo-Ani, you have successfully reeled me in again.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10/10): Has K-On!! improved since the first season? All you need to do is look at the opening theme songs and compare the artwork. Brighter, crisper, smoother, and especially with the live-action scenes, more atmospheric, my eyes were bedazzled by what Kyo-Ani had done, and one can tell they knew how to get their moneys worth from the animation software. Especially with a certain scene in Episode 10 (I think), It was beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10): Absolutely astounding, thats all I can say. Every time a new song played, whether it was the first few minutes of Episode 1, the new Op of GO! GO! Maniac or Utauyo! Miracle or even something as beautiful as U&I or Tenshi ni Fureta yo, nothing disappointed me, I even laughed a little at the lyrics. I remember disliking Yuis voice initially as well, but oh damn, has it grown on me as time gone on, and even Death Devils songs have revived my love for Japanese speed metal. Either way, the songs make up just another reason why I didn't want this season to end, it reminded me of my days on a Fender Bass or my Grand Piano, the two instruments I consider my life and soul.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter Development (9.5/10): The fact that I almost cried at the end of the final few episodes are enough to justify my personal score, because it felt like losing something special to me when i realised the anime was ending so soon, and the manga as well (New manga apparently announced...",

            "content": "Ah K-on!!\r\nI decided to watch this because I had seen the first season and thought I'd watch something I could bash on when it ended, because it's ended now, yes sure, there are two more episodes, but these are just extra helpings of moe for all you fanboys out there.\r\nAt first it was everything I'd expected, it was moe, it was silly, nothing substantial about the anime whatsoever, neither storyboard nor any real screenplay, but then something happened, something that started to happen during the first season yet didn't fully evolve into this feeling I felt after having watched the second season; it grew onme. At this point in time good slice of life anime are a dying breed, atleast for people who aren't fanboys. Everything's been done, producers search desperately for new original ideas, but they're just not there and to tell you the truth K-on!! is not original in any sense, form or colour.  K-on!! shouldn't be good slice of life anime and for me it wasn't exactly good, but it was better than I had expected, it had an atmosphere of coziness, sure sometimes I wanted to smash something when it got excessively moe, but it was cozy, it was homely, the show offers something soothing and if that's what the producers wanted to give their viewers then they've done a pretty good job.\\n\\n\r\nI dislike KyoAni, but they can draw and animate, there is no doubt about it. As for the music, well props to the voice actors and producers for creating an OST it gives a sense of quality and whatever shortcomings K-on!! had, the feeling of quality is tangible. Much like a very, very neatly wrapped present with fancy paper and ribbons and hearts and bunnies and everything else cute you can imagine, yet the content of the present is rather empty. K-on!! will not blow your mind with an innovative storyboard and intriguing screenplay, but it will soothe you, depending on what kind of person you are and for what purpose you watch this show, in one way or another.\\n\\n\r\nTo answer any and all questions or comments that come up after reading this review the correct answer would be; no.",

            "content": "\"Fun things are fun\" \u2013 Hirasawa Yui.\r\nDisclaimer: this is a review of the entire K-On franchise, minor spoilers ahead.\r\nAlmost everybody, including myself at one time, is so narrow-minded when it comes to cute girls doing cute things in cute ways anime, whether we enjoy them or not, that we don't expect anything else than moe, comedy and fan service. In a result, we don't really pay attention to the real quality of this kind of show.\r\nAt first, I saw Keion as an extremely entertaining moeblob series, without being able to explain why. In retrospect, I thought that it started out being a decent one, thatbecame fairly good and even somewhat believable in the late second season. After quite a lot of research and thinking, in addition to a rewatch, I realized that Keion actually has a solid narrative, that characterization and character development are more than satisfying, and that the amount of effort put into details is insane. Don't get me wrong, this isn't Disappearance, it's still a fun series with a high iyashikei potential.\\n\\n\r\nDropping this anime after a couple of episodes, simply because you can't see past the moe and think it's going to be another generic school life for male otakus, is a shame. That was to be expected, though, since KyoAni is well-known for animating stuff like Lucky\u2606Star and The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. Additionally, the original manga was aimed at the type of person mocked by Welcome to the NHK. Moreover and more importantly, the narrative and character development are pretty subtle: you will miss it if you're not attentive, along with tons of cool details, and think that nothing happened.\\n\\n\r\nAs Digibro said, \"this is a story of how each of these girls finds their place in the Light Music Club\". This is the story of their relationship, and ultimately an innocent, adorable and universal story of friendship. Bonus: the second season takes it to a whole new level, but more about that later, I didn't even introduce the characters yet.\\n\\n\r\nThe first episode opens with Yui, a lazy, carefree, and airheaded girl entering high school. Yui, who literally did nothing in her life, struggles to search for a club to join. This brings us to the energetic and careless drummer of the series: Ritsu, who desires to form a band with her childhood friend Mio, a beautiful, shy, reserved and mature bassist. Tsumugi, a gentle and sweet pianist who comes from a rich background and has always dreamed of experiencing a normal rose-colored school life, quickly decides to join their band: the Light Music Club. Later on in the series, the serious guitarist Asuza is struck by the performance of these girls at freshman welcoming ceremony, but doesn't understand their appeal, and ultimately joins it as well. \\n\\n\r\nI'll say it again, dropping this anime after a couple of episodes is a shame. At the end of the first one, it's perfectly understandable if you're skeptical about this show and don't know why you should stick with K-On!, neither Yui knows what to do. She doesn't know what the Light Music Club, \"K-On\" in Japanese, really is about, nor whether she should join it either. While not being astonishing, the beginning makes sense in term of narrative, and Yui could be considered at some level as a metaphor of the viewer, which is pretty nice.\\n\\n\r\nThere is no such thing as cheap and easy way to portray inner thoughts, dilemmas, and emotions in this series. For instance, Yui won't say out of nowhere \"Damn, I just realized that I was being egoist and didn't take guitar seriously, I feel bad for other members.\" with a melodramatic song. It was never stated by any characters: it's up to the audience to understand it. To be honest with you, getting a glimpse of her feelings through her reactions, tones, body language, etc. isn't hard... as long as you're paying attention. I love how this anime is full of this kind of details and subtleties that nobody in the show points out.\\n\\n\r\nIf you have already watched the first season and think badly of it, you might be wondering \"what are you talking about, characters are generic and not developed at all, plus Yui is autistic\". Then as you have already guessed, I'll tell you that you missed lots of meaningful details and subtleties... even though that you aren't completely wrong. This season mostly sets up the characters, their club, and the world they live in. In short, you get the basis of what Keion is. And sadly enough, it's rushed as hell.\\n\\n\r\nIn point of fact, K-On! focuses way more on establishing the setting and on the comedy, than on this franchise's biggest asset: the characters. Their characterization is pretty weak and they hardly ever feel human. At the end of the 13rd episode, while they definitely have changed a little, you won't notice huge differences in their simplistic and moe personality. It's easy yet important to understand how much they love each other and feel comfortable in the Light Music Club, though. The humor is another problem, by frequently feeling cheap and forced (\"Moe Moe Kyun~\"). As for Yui being an airhead autistic savant, it's notably used to show us how incredibly she can get serious for her friends, and of course as a joke.\\n\\n\r\nThe second season improves upon like, everything. From characterization to lighting to animation to direction to comedy to activities. The animation is more lifelike and detailed than ever, colors feel more natural and refined, backgrounds are more realistic, and on and on. While the first season covered two years in only 13 episodes, the second, completed by an OVA plus a movie, benefits from 26 episodes to follow the senior year of Yui, Ritsu, Mio, and Tsumugi. This slow, realistic pace allows to characters way more time to interact naturally with each other, and grow up as people. That's considerable, since while the setting set by the first season was perfectly believable, thanks to the amazing work of Kyoto Animation, characters weren't yet.\\n\\n\r\nVisuals put aside, what really struck me in at the beginning of K-On!! were the changes in nature of humor. This season isn't entertaining solely because of the moe anymore (even though its predecessor had its moments as well), it's amusing because the comedy which involves and relies on cute girls, with their colorful and distinct personality, is genuinely funny. Moe definitely has become an integral part of their characterization, but at the same time, jokes are more mature and sophisticated. For instance, Yui wouldn't have commented on Sawa-chan's love life with a mean undertone in K-On!. It might sound silly, but I think that lots of comedy scenes could only work in this series with these particular characters.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had to describe K-On!! in one word, other than \"fun\", it would be \"healing\" (then \"immersive\", and last but not least \"creative\"). The comedy in Keion has never intended to be over-the-top, nor it should have. Indeed, quite a lot of moments don't aim at making you laugh, KyoAni doesn't force the girls to go out of their personality to make hilarious things happen. While being both, seeing these friends interact with each others and react with various believable situations is often more heartwarming than amusing. You're more likely to find you smiling during the span of an episode and have a good laugh now and then, than dying laughing every minute. Some could argue that Non Non Biyori is better as a relaxing anime, but that would be overlooking the fact that iyashikei is just a part of what makes K-On!! stand out from other moeblob anime.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Asuza could almost be merely defined by \"moe\" at the end of the first season, which left little to no room for character development, she becomes much more human and is given more depth in the second one, at the same time as Yui and the others. The episode where she wonders to what extent her friends influence her, and whether she's still herself, is especially interesting, her relationship with Yui being the key of her development. Being the only underclassman of the Light Music Club, Asuza is going to be left alone by the time the seniors graduate. For the viewers, this season may be all about the dynamic between the characters, but for our lovely girls, this is all about accepting reality and growing up.\\n\\n\r\nDuring the first half of K-On!!, they're too busy to enjoy themselves and making the most of their youth to be concerned about this fact, though. As mentioned before, this season focuses heavily on these five girls interacting with each others. Everyone has experienced a couple of things of what the characters live in the show, from sleeping with friends to studying to graduation. By portraying it in such a realistic yet slightly romanticized and funny way, Keion speaks directly to the heart of viewers. All of these natural interactions and subtle reactions create a deep sense of immersion and ultimately lead to their development.\\n\\n\r\nIn real life, people rarely do a 180\u00b0 in personality from one day to another. They gradually change, grow, evolve. Do not expect a character development like Simon's from Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, but rather few subtle, believable and logical changes in their personality all along the show. Being the pivot in the dramatic progression, Azusa's development is quite special, her attachment to the club and especially toward its members continually growing as graduation is approaching.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of, even though the story ends up mainly resolving around Azusa, the other keion girls have lots of opportunities to grow out of their moe archetypes as well. In a result of being a part of the Light Music Club, even the character with the weakest and most overlooked development, Tsumugi, gradually becomes much more proactive and involved in the life of the club than before. Azusa's personality, development, and conflicted feelings are explored through her interactions with her friends, as well as the other girls, together with few sweet scenes of introspection. All of that naturally leads us to the episode twenty, both climax and payoff of season 2. This episode shows us their last school festival performance, then finally the girls intimately realizing how much they loved their time together, and about graduation.\\n\\n\r\nThe more you connect and become attached to the characters, the more the episode twenty will resonate with you and might become one of your favorite episode of all time (alongside the last battle of Gurren Lagann and the end of The Tatamy Galaxy for my part). Even if you don't care much about these characters, you can still enjoy this episode from a narrative standpoint and for its masterful execution. Along with a stunning animation and great accurate playing, you get a near-to-perfect artistic direction, an amazing sound design, and awesome insert songs. The best part is how Kyoto Animation utilized all of these elements in harmony to create some of the most powerful, emotional, heartbreaking and beautiful scenes I have ever seen, across all mediums. Though a little personal bias might have affected my judgment. I'll say no more but one word about this episode: \"lycopene~\".\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 24, the last one chronologically, and the second climax of the series, made me tear up as well. But again, it is not forced and tearjerking like Jun Maeda's shows (e.g. \"please cry now it's supposed to be a sad scene\" with overblown sad piano and sad violin). These two episodes couldn't have had such an impact on me if this franchise wasn't as I described above. The final arc, with its melancholic atmosphere and tone, is the most logical way to conclude the story given what came before, and thus is the ultimate proof that Keion's narrative makes sense and follows a logical progression.\\n\\n\r\nIt's really important to understand that these episodes don't come out of nowhere. They're so great because of the solid and believable foregoing. To speak only of the graduation, lots of shows make clear of their characters' emotions prematurely (\"oh my god it's our last year together I'll miss you so much... is that sad piano am I hearing? Let's cry!\"). In real life, just like in Keion, people tend to put off this kind of problem and emotions until they no longer can. Not to mention they don't randomly force themselves to talk about it for the pure sake of drama.\\n\\n\r\nSomething Keion does better than most of the shows I've seen, is creating a believable world, a world that feels alive, a world that works on its own. I won't put it on the same level as Cowboy Bebop's world building, but it's still nice to Yui's classmates acting like real people for example. It might feel a little contrived how much everyone cheer for the Light Music Club, though. It's worth mentioning that some recurring side characters, like Yui's sister, Azusa's friend Jun, or Sawa-chan-sensei, are given quite a lot of screentime and a proper treatment. KyoAni's attention to such details helps to build the consistent world I love.\\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, in a result of depicting the daily life of the keion girls with Naoko Yamada's style, this anime is extremely immersive and atmospheric. The complete lack of fanservice contributes significantly to maintaining the suspension of disbelief. While both seasons indeed have scenes with the girls in cute bikini and having reflexions about Mio's or Azusa's chest, they don't exist solely to please the male audience, they're genuinely immersive. You could totally imagine real teenagers wearing this kind of swimsuit and making such friendly mean comments (the few ones in the second season aren't even necessarily explicit, you know, just like in real life). Characters are not sexualized in the least, and the only things that could be considered as cheap fanservice, in its wider meaning, are silly \"moe moe kyun\" jokes from the first season, and Sawa-chan's passion for cute outfits. It's actually quite funny to see the girls' skirts to systematically fall between their legs when they sit down. This is moe at its purest form. That's just how much KyoAni's staff love their work and respect its characters.\\n\\n\r\nOne doesn't have to be an anime veteran to understand the complaints about the lack of creativity of studios when it comes to moe. While Keion doesn't stand out that much in this area, we still should give KyoAni some credit, which definitely get out of their comfort zone in the second season, by not always following the same recipe and trying to keep renewing themselves. Regarding openings, even though I tend to prefer Go! Go! Maniac! to Utauyo!! MIRACLE musically speaking, the last one is really emblematic of what the show has to offer in term of fun and creativity. The latter adjective applies to the legitimately awesome endings as well: Don't say \"lazy\" (the most memorable), Listen! (my favorite), No, Thank You! (the best).\\n\\n\r\nDon't forget Keion is, for the most part, a show about cute girls doing dumb stuff. I am obviously not saying crap like \"at the end it's still just a moeblob anime, it cannot possibly be good\". My aim here is simply to bring to light what this series intended to do and how great the execution is. Being bored by all of these silly characters and lazy afternoons is perfectly understandable, and not the end of the world. Keion may simply not be for you, but hey, there are tons of great shows out of here, just try to keep an open mind.\\n\\n\r\nJust a few words about both OVAs and movie, even though the latter definitely deserves a review on its own. The first OVA takes place after the events of the first season, on the New Year's Eve, and could belong to the second one, with the girls stepping outside of their club and the fun mainly coming from their natural interactions. The second mostly prepares the ground for the movie. Despite being a great condensed version of the second season with truly excelling production values, K-On! Movie is still slightly inferior to the series, in my opinion, the whole being greater than the sum of its parts.\\n\\n\r\nThings are sometimes more than they seem, but at the end, fun things are fun.",

            "content": "Story [9/10]\r\nThe second season is here! I\u2019m surprised how successful this anime is to produce a second season.  0:00 \u2013 2:05 of the first episode blew me away, after watching that part I was thinking: \u201cAlright this is going to be goooooooooood\u201d. Than the opening theme kicks in, and I\u2019m thinking: \u201cOh, man too much is going on here\u201d. Oh, and the rest of the episode is just as wonderful.\r\nArt [10/10]\r\nI can\u2019t tell if there\u2019s improvement on the animation from the first season, but that\u2019s not a bad thing because the animation is just simply gorgeous. The animators really take a lot of pridein their work and put a lot of effort and detail in each scene. In terms of watching an anime for its animation, this is probably the best animation ever created and it really can\u2019t be missed. Your eyes will be blessed with bright brilliant beautiful colours and you\u2019ll be grateful such animators exist.\\n\\n\r\nSound [10/10]\\n\r\nAny movement happening in this anime they\u2019ve got it down. The sound really brings the animation to life along with the characters. From the sound of their footsteps to the sound of the instruments playing is just a privilege for my ears. Recycling the soundtracks from the first season bring you back to the world of K-On!! This is only the first episode, so I\u2019m sure will hear some new tracks. You can\u2019t argue with the voice acting because it\u2019s in Japanese, if it was in English it hurt my ears and turn me off to watching this anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter [9/10]\\n\r\nI cannot watch an anime if the characters aren\u2019t likeable, and these characters are extremely likable.  All the key characters return from the first season of course, the voice acting on each character brings them to life, giving them their own personality. I like all the characters, just picking out my favorites ones are hard. I would have to say my favorite is Mio and Nodoka although she\u2019s a side character and you rarely see her. It\u2019s probably her glasses that stick out.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment [9/10]\\n\r\nWithout a doubt this is an anime for 2010 that cannot be missed, if you haven\u2019t watched the first season, I\u2019d recommend it before watching the new season, because that\u2019s what you do when you watch anime or anything else in general. I guess it would depend on the show or type of movie and this is one of them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall [9/10]\\n\r\nThis is only the first episode of the second season, and I\u2019ve got quite a lot to say.  So, I guess that means it must be that good, huh? I can\u2019t really tell because this was just an improve review for the first episode. I can\u2019t imagine the full review. It would probably be ridiculous, but in a good way. Enjoy!",

            "content": "[~A K-On! casette playing~]\r\nLadies and gentlemen, a review of K-On!! Ahead of you. Hope y'all enjoy.\r\nI'll be reviewing just the one season, not the whole series (although I watched 'em all).\r\nMinor spoilers ahead, I don't think they could offend anyone or anything though.\r\nSo... This anime isn't too great for many people, as they rate is as \"Another kawaii girls series\". Is their opinion right? Of course, it is. I guess everybody is allowed to think positively or negatively about every single series. But yet, it's not another anime about kawaii girls doing kawaii stuff. It has some deeper meanings in its easy plot. I'll betrying to answer some harder questions later, so let's begin with the actual review!\\n\\n\r\nStory - 9 (Great)\\n\\n\r\nAs K-On!! is just about cute girls doing cute things, such as drinking tea or playing music, the story part isn't going to get 10. But, as I've mentioned above, it has some hidden pearls. The friendship is really deep, they're doing almost everything with each other, their lives are based on their friendship really much. Many people would sacrifice their lives just to have such friends, really. In first K-On! their bondings were already beautiful, so you can just think of what they became in the second season. But, you have to remember that the friendship isn't the only part of the story. They also make concerts, learn to important exams with each other, do sleepovers and really many other stuff, yet it's not worth to spoiler more, because you should watch them by yourself!\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10 (Outstanding)\\n\\n\r\nThe art hasn't changed since K-On! ended, so I don't have to tell you anything more. As from what I remember they didn't improve anything, the look of the characters is still beautiful, landscapes are quite nice and it is really satisfying seeing how they animated the guitar moves well. Hats off. Keep in mind that it's still a better offshoot of traditional KyoAni artstyle, also known from e.g. Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuutsu 2009.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9 (Great)\\n\\n\r\nOPs and EDs are awesome. Soundtrack is great, music from concerts is nice. I can't remind myself of any outstanding tracks out of here, but the soundtrack fits well to the genres of K-On series. Of course you can't compare it to any greater work, e.g. Kanye, yet it's quite nice.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10 (Outstanding)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are brilliant. I haven't watched an anime in which I identified with every hero or heroine as I did in K-On!!. They way they're behaving is outstanding - for everyone! We have a stubborn, but friendly and caring Ritsu, intelligent, but scared of everything Mio, cute and generous Mugi, self-possessed and also caring Azusa, and lazy, happy, joyful main heroine - Yui. They all are members of a band named \"Fuwa Fuwa Time\" - as mentioned above, they're doing really many things together. The way they behave hasn't changed since K-On!, yet I feel like they all grew up a bit. Although they act almost the same, something has changed. This part could've also been described as \"boring, repeatable bunch of friends\" - no, no, no. Not like that. They're more than just a bunch of friends. They are a family. If you've watched Clannad After Story, you'll know what I actually mean.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10 (Outstanding)\\n\\n\r\n\"geez ive been crying all the night cause it ended\" - it perfectly says anything about Enjoyment terms. Since its plot is very easy, the characters are different, but wholesome, you don't have to think too much, the art is beuaitful - you can fully enjoy the anime. Not to say, its simplicity is the actual reason why it's so enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10 (Outstanding)\\n\\n\r\nDon't take me wrong, it's not a masterpiece. Despite having a nice story, beautiful art, brilliant characters and one of the best enjoyments ever, it has some issues, e.g. its story isn't that superior and the soundtrack is somehow forgettable. Neverthless, it's a really solid title if you are looking for an anime in which there are some girls that just want to have fun. Of course I gave a lower rating to Story and Sound comparing it to other series, but in case of comparision to similar series K-On is horribly outstanding and rating of Story and Sound is easily 10. (9*2+10*3):5=(18+30):5=9,6 | 9,6\u224810 | 10=10\\n\r\nIt just got what it deserves.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading, hope y'all actually enjoyed this one. Have a nice time watching this!",

            "content": "If I were to come up to you and ask if you would watch a show about 5 high school girls drinking tea and having fun, chances are you'd back away slowly and begin to either call the police or whip out the pepper spray or taser. Where's the action, the romance, the suspense? Is there even a storyline? A plot? A movie critic would probably burst into tears at the anti-Hollywood-like characteristics of this horrendous \"TV show?\" \r\nWell I have braved the troubled waters of slice-of-life to come before this golden nugget among others: K-On! To dispense some of the hate and malice, letme assure you, I had almost no hopes for this show at all. When introduced to season 1, I was skeptical and a little paranoid. My thought process was: this is going to be one big suck. Of terribleness. Of all time. There was nothing more that I wanted to do than watch 4 or 5 high school girls sip tea and experience the trivialities of life. Especially when I'm inundated with school work and up to my chest in thing-to-do. (Can you taste the sarcasm?). But this show blew me far away into the zone of no return.\\n\\n\r\nI loved this show. Regardless of its pointless plot, useless storyline, girly characters and circular reasonings, I managed to come out laughing and even sharing this little anime. Though the title implies music, maybe 3 or 4 episodes ever had any musical playing in it. That didn't matter! K-On sucked you into the useless plot faster than you could struggle away. It's like quicksand, I tell you! \\n\\n\r\nThough there is lots of skepticism and controversy regarding the show's enjoyment, let me introduce you to one of the biggest critics out there: me. I thought nothing wasted more time than watching garbage like this. I adamantly refused to observe material of this quality; I felt like this was a waste of time. But lo and behold, the characters sort of stick to you, more than the mochi they frequently talked about. No, what kept me rigged with attention were the characters and situations themselves. \\n\\n\r\nThe tone remained static almost the entire time; the last episode, however, became oddly serious and really sad. Actually, the last couple of episodes clamped down, as if the director and producer had a meeting and wanted to go out with a bang. And a bang they did. You become so emotionally attached to the each character's traits and personality, the last episode feels like a bittersweet moment: happy for the girls, yet sad to see them move on with their artificial and fantasy life. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves remained lovable and enjoyable. They were intimate, yet had almost no arguments. They had an everlasting friendship bond, yet seemed never to be angry; they joked often and never were reprimanded. The most trouble any of the girls got into was when one of them made a bad joke. But of course, each character had their own traits.\\n\\n\r\n Ritsu, the leader and drummer of the group, was brash, bold and brave, often going out of her way to annoy or pester Mio. She is a rough-and-tumble sort of girl, taking life as it comes, often forgetting her responsibilities (such as renting the auditorium for them to perform!) and leading the group from place to place. She plays the drums, wears a headband and is proud of her salient forehead  Mio was the quiet, shy girl, with moe characteristics, insecurities, clumsiness, easily terrified sort of way, yet mild-headed to all except Ritsu, her close childhood friend whom Mio often hits in retaliation to Ritsu's teasing. She plays the bass, that she named Elizabeth, has long black hair and is heavily self-conscious about her looks. Mugi is a rich, loyal, fun-loving sort of person, who seems never to enjoy the small things in life, like an arcade. She plays the piano, and makes the tea and brings the food for their daily afternoon tea time. Yui is an airhead, but a lovable one nonetheless. She enjoyed food much more than the others, picks up music really fast, and is easily distracted. She plays the guitar (she named Gitah), has short brown hair, and the story usually revolves around her. Asuza (Azu-Nyan, as they tend to call her) is a small girl, one year younger, with long black hair who plays the guitar. She is quick-witted, often tries to get practice together but fails frequently. \\n\\n\r\nUi, Yui's sister, is the antithesis of Yui. She is responsible, loving in a parent sort of way, and cares for Yui often throughout the series. Jun is a friend of Ui and Asuza, but she seems more selfish and is jealous of the light music club.\\n\\n\r\nThe art work is stunning. The attention to detail is enormous - if you pause at any scene, try to look for hidden detail: the chips and holes in the desk, the way the guitar pegs are drawn, the way light bounces of key parts of their instruments, the way they play their instruments is all drawn to the exact detail. I do play both the guitar and piano, and I could actually follow along with Yui and Mugi's parts when their fingers were shown. I was very impressed by the detail. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is also similarly impressive. The songs were kind and carefree, not too serious, yet had difficult parts for all the instruments. Though they did play relatively few songs, not to mention very few new ones, they had an aura of happiness that makes one want to spring up and dance for no particular reason. The OP and ED are fantastic and well-made - I never skipped them, even though I'm pressed for time sometimes. The OP was always upbeat and led you wanting more - the ED was much more serious and carried more weight, as if to tell you that K-ON was done for the day.\\n\\n\r\nThe story. Oh, how the story is the center of all this controversy! Alas, how little it is understood! If you were tasked to make this anime, what would you do different? Would you instead have the girls be in class all day, then perhaps play their instruments and go home? NO!! The viewers would swoon from boredom and tedium. Though many argue that the story is not a story, but pointless little synopsis's of their daily routine, I say, well, of COURSE IT IS. School is boring! What more to make it fun than to add a little twist - a comedic tone underlying small substories! Absolute genius. This was the heart and core of the anime; or as Yui says, the heart of the cake is the strawberry! \\n\\n\r\nOverall, it was enjoyable to say the least. Though there were no serious performances, and probably none of this would ever happen in real life, I still loved every bit of this sweet and delicious cake, followed by some afternoon tea. Though it may not seem like much, by the end, you will almost miss their daily tea time; it becomes ingrained into your head. Parting with this anime was bittersweet: Houkago Tea Time, rock on! Remember: FUWA FUWA TIME!",

            "content": "I don't know why I like K-On!!, but I do. It's one of those shows that features nothing you're normally interested in, but you just can't help but enjoy the atmosphere of the group. People watch slice of life shows because they love involving themselves mentally in the story. So, the basic definition of a good slice of life show is one where you'd want to be a part of it. This is what K-On's done so well.\r\nStory: 5 high school girls have formed a band with the resolution to play at \"Budokan!\" A large music fest. The story in K-On!! moreso just follows thegirls around their high school activities though. Going on field trips, hanging out after school, eating tea and cake =3. It's all very slice of life. I don't really feel the need to bring up the moe aspect of the show. A show is good or bad on it's own merit, not on how it archetypes it's characters. Granted, that obviously has a role to play, but with the \"cute girls doing cute things\" factor aside, you just enjoy everyone's personalities as they are.\\n\\n\r\nArt: K-On!! is very well animated. The art style is very soft, in that everyone is designed to look younger than your avg. anime character of the same age. But I guess that's moe, I dunno, I don't normally watch moe shows. What I particularly like though, is the detailing in the outlines of characters. The way they've animated things has this eye-catching effect about it. Very good animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound: K-On's background soundtrack has that sort of fun loose feeling that gets you in the mood to watch a show full of fluff. This is really key, because actual background music and sound effects are often ignored in reviews and sometimes even in actual production, and it's these shows that usually aren't as entertaining. K-On!! has a soothing quality just like the tea they famously drink. No matter what mood you start an episode in, by the end you'll feel relaxed because of how the soundtrack has influenced you. The only funny thing to note is the opening's hyperactive singing really throws you off to the overall mood of the show. The end does a nice job of livening things up. Overall, the animation quality in both makes them very interesting AMV's in their own right, as have all K-On OP's and ED's, and you'll end up loving them with repeated exposure. Just like Justin Bieber... Oh god, I can't even jokingly finish that sentence. JB is the worst thing to happen to the eardrums since Spice Girls.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on...\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Ah the K-On Cast. It's very interesting to see how Yui has developed since the beginning of the first season. Everyone is still very much the same, but Yui is definitely more energetic than in the past. Ritsu has grown a little more responsible, Mio, a little less shy, and Mugi... well Mugi gets experience in the outside world. Azusa develops as well, though you wouldn't notice any of this without really reflecting on it. I suppose that's the moe bogging it down. But genuinely, there's actually a lot of character development that goes on in this show, and it happens so seamlessly you wouldn't even notice. That's good writing in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Though this season has far less emphasis on the music, what little you hear of the songs is still just as addicting as anything else. You'll find yourself watching this show, caught up in the slice o' life aspect, and you won't mind one bit. It's the sort of thing you can watch either 1 episode, or several, and the overall impact will still be the same. K-On's highly enjoyable. I would parrot the notion that never was K-On!! in any way made to market to a more adult fan base. It's rather refreshing (especially after just watching HOTD).\\n\\n\r\nOverall, K-On!!'s a great series, and I would say you're probably fine to watch season 2 without having seen season 1, but I wouldn't recommend it, simply because you'll want more K-On fun at the end, and the only bits you'll get to see are events that have already transpired.\\n\\n\r\nThat's K-On. It wasn't revolutionary or incredible, but it was surprisingly very good. And this is coming from someone completely outside the moe fan base.",

            "content": "K-on!! Is somewhat hard to review, so this will probably a short one. \r\nStory: The very first thing that you will notice about K-on!! Is its lack of a story. There is plot for every episode, but most of the time it\u2019s just a comedic skit which shows the daily life of the members of the light music club. There really isn\u2019t much to talk about in terms of the story, which is really surprising considering the popularity of the series. I would give it a 6/10 because it just lacks a solid plot.\r\nArt: The art is great, as expected of KyoAni. The animation wassuperb, the art was solid and pretty much everything is perfect. One thing I would like to mention is the moe-ness(is this even a word?) of the anime, which is one of the main selling points of the anime. If you\u2019re a fan of moe animes, you will most certainly love this. I gave it a 9/10 for being well-animated, but that is to be expected considering that they also animated clannad, The melancholy of haruhi suzumiya and other great animes.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Considering that this is an anime that focuses on a music club, it is quite obvious that the sounds are very good. The voice acting was done well, the background music was perfect but the thing i liked the most are the songs, which is another one of its main selling points. They are light and have a certain charm, very different from most of the crap we hear today and for that I would give it a 10/10. FuwaFuwa all the way!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:  The characters are all loveable and have certain unique qualities that separate them from other characters. But because K-on!! doesn\u2019t have much of a story, there isn\u2019t much character development either. The only character with much character development is Azunyan, who from a somewhat serious character turns into a more laid back and cheerful girl. But even if there isn\u2019t any character development, it can also be said that there isn\u2019t any need for development, since the characters are already perfect and for that, I would give it an 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: The thing that makes K-on!! an amazing anime is that even with a lack of a story, it still manages to entertain its viewers, and pretty well on that matter. Its light-hearted theme and original jokes make people come back for more. It\u2019s the kind of anime that relies purely on entertaining its viewers to keep them watching, and they have succeeded on that matter. I really have no idea on how they kept it fresh; it could be the comedy, the cuteness, or the music but either way, they really did a good job on entertaining me and i\u2019m sure that it will entertain you to. For that I give it a 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give it an 8/10 because even though it is entertaining, it lacks something that makes animes exciting: a story. Though it kept me watching, it loses some of its charm after a while but it is still one of the best animes out there.\\n\\n\r\nRemember when i said this would be a short review? Well I lied :p If you have read through the entire review then i would like to thank you :)) if there are any mistakes in my grammar then srry because English is not my first language.\\n",

All the memories of happiness and feelings fill up a treasure box. The lasting days in the lives of the K-On!! girls is a golden collection asking to be embraced. And I will embrace them. Always.\r\nWhile I absolutely adored the cake eating and lazing around aspect in the first season, this season took a solid shift that presented the series into a great slice-of-life. It wasn't limited to their club room only, and these five cute stars embarked on a branching set of activities from schooltrips to concerts where they interacted adorably with precious friendship. No matter where they are, there's never a dull moment with them around. Just look at the cuteception. They're even self-aware of their own cuteness! These characters have a special quality to them other than their entertaining personalities. From the family bond as sisters or the relationship they had with their teacher, an aura is formed where every soul who stumbled upon it will form an attachment. So, as graduation is nearing, the club members have to realize that they must move on with the next stage of their life. And to move along with a strong friendship that will last for eternity. All the fun times and the silly times they had, these are the memories that held the evidence that their bonds are true. That closeness, which was formed in the realm of simple day-to-day interactions, was a purity that described a genuine friendship. Every moments were meaningful. Every moments activated my attachment. Every time, they never failed to place a smile on my face.\\n\\n\r\nUnder the windows of their treasured club room, the rays of a warm and setting afternoon light glazes over the best friends. Backed up by a soothing melody, they cherished the time they had spent together after a spectacular run of their last ever high school performance. This was a heartwarming scene and if not for the audiovisual talents from Kyoto Animation, it wouldn't had become such a special scene that permeated with joyous and sad emotions. The amount of efforts put in by them was something that I appreciated. The visual captured all kinds of tone hanging in the air. Those googly eyes that gazed all the way through my kokoro switched on my affectionate side. The energy-driven animation expressed the character's personality without the need for narrative techniques effectively. And then there was the soft lighting that spoke on so many levels, mostly to radiate positivity. All these made the small moments into something more meaningful, because there were some fine feelings hidden beneath the realistic colors. Another aspect behind the visual was in the sound and their relaxing sensation can be felt without disturbing the lighthearted interactions of the characters. Each one of the seiyuus acted out their roles with a cute tone. Performed by them as well, the songs played during the club performance were fun to listen to. Some of the songs also embodied a deeper meaning in the lyrics so hearing these filled me up with even more emotions as they performed together as a close group.\\n\\n\r\nK-On!! is an anime for U&I. Every time I watch an episode, I know that I will no doubt feel happiness. And I'm sure you too can feel that same happiness. We all can become a piece of this memory and preserve it. Wouldn't that be the perfect treasure?",

            "content": "Yamada Naoko is a director that I have been interested for a while. Female directors are kind of a rare breed, and because of that I find her films to be interesting in a way that it gives a different perspective. But that's not all, she herself is a live-action fanatic. Not just animation, but live-action. She's basically the kind of personnel that Hideaki Anno (Director of Evangelion) is hoping to find more of in the animation industry. This is also the reason why Kyoto Animation shows are so interesting. \r\n\"It depends on what kind of a film it would be. Unlike live action, withanimation we have to simplify the real world. Women tend to be more realistic and manage day-to-day lives very well. Men on the other hand tend to be more idealistic \u2013 and fantasy films need that idealistic approach.\"\\n\\n\r\n^\\n\r\n||\\n\\n\r\nMight explain why most Kyoto Animation shows are SoL.\\n\\n\r\nK-ON is not idealistic. K-ON is realistic. Especially in the highschool girls department. In other words, it doesn't have to have this grandiose plot that most seem to seek of. Its grandiosity is its simplicity. K-ON is a show about friendship. It is a show about how different people can change different people. The characters are multi-faceted. Basically, they are treated in the show as real people not as characters. In a way that they react differently to different things. They don't go out of their way to deliver the jokes or add drama. They all follow in this logical sense of personality.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIs K-ON about \"music\"?\\n\\n\r\nNo, K-ON is not about music, it's about being in a band. A band is a group of people making music, and that's what K-ON is about. A group of people. \\n\\n\\n\r\nK-ON doesn't have a plot....\\n\\n\r\n\"Plot refers to the sequence of events inside a story which affect other events through the principle of cause and effect.\" -Wikipedia\\n\\n\r\nK-ON does indeed have a plot in a way that it has a cause (the formation of the club) and effect (characters evolution and attachment at the end of the series). But I think what matter the most is the execution of the premise. K-ON's premise can be summed up in two words, tea time. But the way it executes on those initial ideas, and expand on them for the rest of the show is fucking excellent. By the end of the series, tea time pretty much means their lives to them. And the fact that it is ending is akin to death. Episode 20 will destroy you without realizing it. I myself never knew that I was so attached to these girls subconsciously, until it was getting near the end. It was emotional, it was gripping, it was the probably the greatest scene I have experienced in all of anime. It was a fuwa fuwa time.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTo summarize, what makes K-ON so fucking good, is that it is a coalescence of small details that all pack up into this big package of emotion. The more you watch it, the more you'll love it.",

            "content": "I dislike how autistic they've made Yui in K-On!! as compared to the first series.\r\nI put that first because honestly it's my biggest gripe, and I figure it will trigger some people. It first hit me six or seven episodes in, like \"oh my god, Yui is autistic!\" and after that realization I could never get over my shift in perspective. In the first series, Yui was a ditzy, airheaded girl who was still a brilliant musician, and brought the band together. In the second, she's a barely-functioning autist whose friends do nothing but enable her. I mean, this girl clearly needs psychiatric assistance, butinstead all the supporting characters just let her be without steering her in a healthy manner. The biggest crime with Yui is that she magically still gets good grades and is great at guitar; unfortunately, like other movies/shows that deal with the spectrum, it's not a \"savant\" plot device, it just comes across as blind luck or even a superpower that isn't explained.\\n\\n\r\nThat aside, the tone shift is way too much for me. At least two-thirds of the episodes have some serious melodrama as opposed to the first series' consistent carefree attitude. Honestly, it's depressing. More than that, it's unrelatable. I know I'm a grown adult with almost half my life between high school and where I'm at now, but the way K-On!! mixes up all these feels with the end of high school (which drags out for half a dozen episodes at least) is so alien to me. The high school setting wasn't an issue in the first series because it was simply a canvas for the characters to be painted on; here, it's a large focus much to its detriment. \\n\\n\r\nLast, K-On!! is twice as long as it needs to be. I have no issue with an entire series being devoted to their third year, but it did not need to be 24 episodes + 2 OVAs (and a film that I might get around to). There should have been a third series that dealt with the break between high school and university, or even better just on university. Barring that, it should have just been halved and ended.\\n\\n\r\nAll the same and excepting what I mentioned above, the characters are still great, the animation is very addicting, and, obviously, the music is sensational (and very catchy!). I just really wish the producers didn't change so much and instead focused on maintaining a happy, cheerful atmosphere without all the high school drama. Oh well.",

            "content": "This review will encompass the K-On franchise as a whole.\r\nIntroduction: When I decided to watch K-On, I wasn\u2019t expecting much. I had seen the memes of the main character, Yui Hirasawa and her friends acting cute and bumming around. I had heard that K-On was the phenomenon that popularized the concept of \u201cmoe\u201d in anime and spread its influence further, corrupting the modern industry, and giving it its odd infatuation with the premise of \u201ccute girls doing cute things\u201d, something that has had an iron grip on anime as a whole as of late. While I personally do not hold great disdain for this \u201cgenre\u201d- if you will - I will admit that I\u2019m not the biggest fan of it and would rather watch an anime that centres around character development and a deep, entrancing story. Now, why did I start to watch K-On? The answer is rather simple; I wanted a show that was filled to the brim with happiness after I completed the rather depressing anime known as Paranoia Agent. What I got instead was an anime that was very bitter-sweet, and filled with characters that I personally cared about. \\n\\n\r\nStory (9/10): If one were to take K-On\u2019s story at face value, it would not be interesting in the slightest. It\u2019s been done countless of times before. A student who had just entered high school joins an odd club and establishes friendships that last her a lifetime. This kind of story has been etched into our collective consciousness, and whenever we sit down to watch anime that holds this premise, we can foresee the development of its plot points far before they actually unfold on the screen before us. However, the strength of K-On\u2019s story does not lay in its cliche premise, but rather in its heartfelt execution. Unlike many high-school dramas, K-On follows its characters as they grow and mature (or not) over the course of their three years in school. During this period of time, we watch as Yui Hirasawa, originally an unmotivated girl on a collision course with a NEET lifestyle, grow talented in music, and we see her create eternal bonds with her fellow club members. The denizens of the Light Music Club face everyday issues such as exams and concerts, but the most harrowing of these issues is the problem of growing up. And this fact of life is the central theme of K-On\u2019s story, and it is a theme that is seldom touched upon in slice-of-life anime. We all experience growing old, the separation from childhood friends, and the eventual acceptance that our youthful innocence and naivety does not last forever. As such, K-On\u2019s story is immediately relatable. The emotions of the girls in the Light Music Club are conveyed with such realism as they confront with this inevitable reality, and it is genuinely heart-breaking as we watch with them contend with this issue. I can confidently say that the latter half of K-On is one of the most bitter sweet moments in anime, period. It evoked more emotions in me than notorious sad anime such as Clannad and Your Lie in April because the characters were relatable, but I\u2019ll get to that in the next section. On a side note, K-On\u2019s humour is top-notch and certainly evoked at least a chuckle or two from me each episode. I also applaud K-On for not relying on fanservice for its humour. That is extremely rare for an anime with an all-female cast, so kudos to them.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters(8/10): K-On\u2019s characters are generally what one would expect from a slice-of-life anime involving cute girls and music. Yui Hirasawa is your classic airhead who delights in eating sweets all day and gawking at cute things. Ritsu Tainaka is the boyish (and forgetful) drummer who takes great satisfaction in teasing her friends and playing relatively harmless pranks around the school. Mio Akiyama is the bassist for the band, and despite her best efforts to maintain a cool exterior, on the inside she is very fearful and shy. Tsumugi Kotobuki is the keyboardist and ditzy member of the band. She grew up rich, and is ignorant to many of the customs of common folk. Finally, we have Azusa Nakano, who is the youngest of the band, and yet she is also the most strict. From this brief summary, one can surmise that K-On\u2019s characters aren\u2019t exactly original. That is true, though, the greatest impact of K-On\u2019s characters is how human they feel. When we see a snapshot of their daily lives in each episode, we feel as if we are right alongside them as they partake in their antics. Almost every main character feels realistically like a person you would meet on the street, each with their own quirks, strengths and weaknesses. While Yui may be an airhead and probably a victim of ADD, she works hard when it counts and cares deeply for her friends. Ritsu may appear to be a unintelligent jerk from the outside, but in reality she holds deep affection for her friends and she succeeds when it counts. Mio is very smart and beautiful, though she suffers greatly from anxiety, and despite this, she tries again and again to fight it so that she may play on stage without fear. Azusa is strong-willed and is very skilled at guitar, and yet she has such a great attachment to her seniors that it is almost damaging to her psyche, and so she does everything she can to cope with their inevitable graduation. Unfortunately, I could not find any substantial flaws in Tsumugi\u2019s character. She succeeds at everything, she is beautiful, and she is talented. I hate to say it, but Tsumugi is very well the Mary-Sue of this story. Whether that is intentional or not, I cannot say. Nonetheless, she is a likeable character all the same.\\n\\n\r\nArt(9/10): K-On is beautifully animated, no questions asked. The backgrounds are bright and full of colour. The school is well defined as a location. The main characters are all well designed, and their appearances are memorable. K-On\u2019s animation shines the brightest during the scenes when the girls are playing their instruments. Every character\u2019s finger movements match up to the beat of the music, which is especially thrilling when you see Yui or Azusa\u2019s fingers on their guitar strings match the fast-paced grooves of the song they\u2019re playing. All in all, there is not much to complain about when it comes to K-On\u2019s animation, except for some minor nitpicking. Some character faces do look the same but with different hair, and many of the background characters are dull and not very interesting. The artstyle does get a substantial upgrade in the movie, however. London is beautifully animated, and the characters themselves are very crisp and pleasing to the eye. The best part about the animation in the movie, in my opinion, is how each character\u2019s facial expressions are greatly defined. They really bring out each character\u2019s personality and help convey their reactions to the events unfolding around them with fantastic detail. \\n\\n\r\nSound(8/10): The music of K-On is perhaps the most controversial section of the anime. I\u2019ll begin with the stock background music. It fits each scene, though it is not particularly memorable and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll go back to listen to the anime\u2019s soundtrack anytime soon. Next up, the openings and endings. I found the opening from season one and the first opening of season two to be catchy and enjoyable, but unfortunately, the opening for the second half of season two was a tad ear-grating and I did end up continually skipping it after I heard it for the first time. All three endings were just find, though I did not listen to them more than once each. The main cast\u2019s seiyuu all did fantastic work and beautifully captured their respective character\u2019s emotions and mannerisms, which in turn made them feel even more alive alongside the exceptional writing. Nodoka\u2019s seiyuu could\u2019ve used some work, as her voice cracked now and again, but that\u2019s very minor. And now, onto the main songs he bands played. Overall, I enjoyed them. I found them all to be fun to listen to, and one track in particular at the end of the series is a real tear-jerker. Yui\u2019s voice fits the tone of each song, and I did not find her voice to be irritating at all.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10): Every episode of K-On was hands-down fun to watch. I loved the story, character interactions, and seeing how the story of the Light Music Club would progress. It was touching to see the characters age over the course of their high school years, and how they would eventually come to terms with growing old. As I watched K-On, I really grew attached to this lovable cast of characters because their issues were relatable and very human. K-On is one of the few anime that is able to make me laugh and cry from beginning to end.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: Behind K-On\u2019s seemingly cliche exterior lays a surprisingly poignant story about growing up and coming to terms with the fact that nothing lasts forever. Alongside a bright artstyle, rockin\u2019 music, and memorable characters, K-On is one anime you\u2019ll surely remember for years to come. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:  8.8/10\\n",

            "content": "What do you get when you mix: Moe, Music, Slice of Life, Comedy and A little Drama. You get K-ON!!, the masterpiece made by the great Kakifly. This review will cover Seasons 1 and 2 and the Music from the series.\r\nStory: 9/10. The story is pretty normal, four girls start a band in their first year of high school and it shows their life as they go through high school playing music or just having fun. The story is very basic which have been used before in other Anime's but \u201cK-ON!!\u201d is one of the ones that actually do it right and pull it offperfectly. Season 1 focuses more on the music side of the coin while Season 2 focuses more of the Slice of Life genre.\\n\\n\r\nArt: -/- I don\u2019t rate for art because it is not a deciding factor on how I watch Anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 100/10. This is where \u201cK-ON!\u201d excels beyond any other Anime that I have seen. The series start out with Cageyake! GIRLS, it is a very weird opening but grows on you and you end up singing along to it in the end. Then there is Don't Say \u201cLazy\u201d the first ending theme, which is a techno rock song which is very amazing. I really liked how the made the openings. The first is always sung by Yui and the Ending is always sung by Mio. I know at first its hard to get used to Yui singing but it grows on you. \\n\\n\r\nNext is GO! GO! MANIAC, really fast song, it is my least favorite of the three opening but it still is really good. Listen!! is the second opening, which is really done well and is on par with Don't Say Lazy's greatness. I love the keybored in and the vocals. Mio proves once again, she is the bomb. \\n\\n\r\nThen here come the last two OP/ED's of \u201cK-ON!!\u201d...Utauyo! MIRACLE and No, Thank You. Probably the greatest op/ed combo ever. Utauyo is still my favorite oping in the entire series because its so much fun to sing along too and just epic. This is where Yui shines like Takuto Tsunashi's Galaxy. No, Thank You is the greatest ending theme ever period bar none. It is perfect, I cant find anything bad to say about it.\\n\\n\r\nAs for insert songs we have:\\n\r\nFuwa Fuwa Time (I love playing this song in my car with the windows down on full blast lol its awesome, Mio does the best job on this song.)\\n\r\nMy Love is a Stapler (very catchy and fun)\\n\r\nCalligraphy Pen ~Ballpoint Pen~ (Mio does the best on this song so listen to her version. This one is also very catchy and is one that I could see playing at dances)\\n\r\nPure Pure Heart (Probably the weakest out of all the insert songs, but it still is very good. It is just the one with the least plays on my iPod.)\\n\r\nGohan wa Okazu (This song is so much fun, it is my favorite out of all the insert song. This song is so like Yui, it defines her to a T. If I was in a band I would play this song because its just so much fun and hilarious.)\\n\r\nU&I (My second favorite insert song, the lyrics are perfect and have great meaning. It was the perfect ending song to their last festival. It gave me chills.)\\n\r\nTenshi ni Fureta yo! (This song was done so perfectly, and was so sad. 1. Because it was the last song of the series 2. the lyrics were all about Azu-nyan and it was sad seeing Azu-nyan cry while they played it. Beautiful song, perfect ending to the series)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10 Here's another place where \u201cK-ON!!\u201d excels. The main characters are really memorable and have good development throughout the series. Mio is the quiet, extremely shy, yet the most mature out of the group. Yui is the lazy, cute, spaced out and lazy member of the group (She reminds me a bit of Osaka from Azumanga but is more lazy and less spaced out.) Mugi is the rich girl who has no street smarts and it very impressed by everything people do. Ritchan is the crazy wild girl who always stirs up trouble. Azu-nyan is the one that is always pushing the group to practice and is really good at playing the guitar, she ends up even teaching Yui when she joins the group. I might as well mention Sawa-chan, their adviser. She was hilarious when she first showed up and is the metal head/cosplayer of the group. She always tries to dress up everyone in cute, moe outfits. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall 10/10. I love this series, it will always be in my Top 5. The music in it is legend and  everything else makes up the series is amazing. If your a fan of Music and Slice of Life, this Anime is for you. If your not into that, then this show is not for you. But, it won't hurt just to try it out, you just might like it.",

            "content": "When thinking of K-On! as a series, a few words may come to mind. Whether it be happy, cheery, moe, simple or maybe even mind-numbing, K-On!! will always be one of my favorites. \r\nK-On! itself is a slice of life show, there's no getting around that. The daily lives of the girls part of a music club in their High School. When labelled as a slice of life show, the stigma of a nonexistent or shoddy plot is almost always attributed with those shows. However K-On!'s plot over the course of two seasons may seem excessively simple at first, but as one begins to headinto the later portions of the second season and look back upon the journey, there are definitely lessons to be learned and messages to be discovered. \\n\\n\r\nStory (8/10): The second season of K-On!! covers the final year of high school for the four founders of the Light Music club. If you count the first season, the story progression covers all the high school years of the club, and so coming into the final year, there is added weight to the thought that \"this is it\". It's the final year. The season takes advantage of that plot device and slowly but surely instills the premise of graduation and moving on. While graduation itself is not a very original concept, there was something very novel about watching the characters' deal with the concept of not having a next year to look forward to. There are a fair share of the moments that were cherished in season one filled with hilarity and light-heartedness, but towards the end there are sentimental and slightly sad feelings (although they're never really melodramatic or pushed upon you). This offered as a good balance to the very polarizingly happy-go-lucky style of show that season one was, and it was a great way to instill some great ideas that I'll go into later on in the review. \\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10): Kyoto Animation is known for being slick in their animation and reliably creative in their character designs. That being said, K-On!! is visually appealing, as it relies on bright and warm colors and the animation never falls behind either. That being said, it's nothing mind blowing and that's perfectly acceptable for slice of life. Your eyes will be treated however, the a plethora of different cakes, teas and snacks. All in all, the art within K-On!! is suitable for the series and the characters, never hindering it but at the same time, not really boosting it to any higher than it needs to be. In other words, it's just right. \\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10): K-On!! is labelled as a music anime, and it contains the songs that are created and performed by Ritsu, Mugi, Mio, Yui and Azusa. The songs almost never disappoint, filled with guitar and drums and innocent lyrics that are oddly captivating. Although some may be disappointed by the lack of music in every episode, it still offers to be a pleasant treat whenever they do have a performance or whenever the audience is witness to a new song. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9/10): Both seasons of K-On! rely heavily on the interactions and personalities of the characters as most slice of life shows generally do. The characters are generally simple, but they do come with their own unique attributes and enthusiasms as well as their \"problems\" that they have to deal with (note this is a very relaxed show so it's nothing jaw dropping in terms of problems). They do silly things all the time and if you enjoyed the first season there's no reason that you won't enjoy most of the second season. Later on when the mood shifts a bit, you see sides in the characters that you didn't really see too much previously. It was very interesting to see their development as their high school years came to an end, and some of the concepts they had to come to face with. \\n\\n\r\nEffect *minor spoiler?* (9/10): In this section I will outline what I felt were some of the themes that I picked up on throughout the second season. Towards the end of the second half of the second season, the concept of graduation dawns upon the four girls who started up the club. With this concepts comes a few lessons to be learned. The coming of age idea has been used throughout anime and media for a very long time. Growing up and/or moving on to a different stage of your life is something very compelling and interesting. However many other shows seem to deal with this as a battle of conflicts, whether internal or external that break the characters and reforge them anew into their new developed status. K-On!! has it's share of low key \"conflict\" but it takes on a very different perspective on that idea of moving on. The show demonstrates what it means to have a fulfilling \"childhood\",in this case high school career. It shows the importance of making good memories and having a great time while you can so that however many years down the road you can look back and smile, knowing that you didn't regret anything and that you had a blast. It also covers something important as in the theme of passing the torch, and leaving a legacy. The girls who started the club quickly realize that their days are numbered in high school so they try their best to make sure that their work is not only remembered but continued. Moments such as taking the stage for the very last time carry special weight in the second season and you can feel it. Instead of creating turmoil and drama in the group, the writers decided to take the 4koma that K-On!! was and display a story of happiness, even if a big obstacle like moving on presented itself. It warms the heart from the core and shows the girls rejoicing and laughing till the very end knowing that they dreamed big (going for the Budokan) and at the very least if they fell short that they fell short laughing and daring greatly. And that through their actions, they inspired the ones before them as their legacy was cemented. As K-On!! concluded, it was a story of a group of girls who joined an outdated and unpopular club, with no real expectations and big dreams of reaching the Budokan. It was a story about how those girls had fulfilling and joyous moments throughout their journey, and it really didn't matter if they never achieved that dream because the memories they made along the way could never have a price put on them. It was a story of the four girls who walked off after graduating happy and content, being bid adieu by their fans and entrusting their legacy in the hands of those who would replace them. It was the story of the girls that never stopped laughing, eating cake and drinking tea because nothing could take them away from each other and their precious moments. It was the story that grabbed my heart and never let go, securing itself deep inside never to be forgotten. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10): This is one of the shows that I can say I very thoroughly enjoyed. I came for the relaxed and joyous mood that the first season presented but I stayed for the lessons of the second season and the opportunity to look back in awe of their accomplishments. Not much about K-On!! is overly blown up or exaggerated, it's a very humble story of a school club band. But the feelings that it left behind surely were not to be underplayed or unrecognized. K-On!!'s unique and cheery take on moving on will surely never leave me, as I enjoyed it to the very end. It kept me interested, it made me laugh, it made me sad but most of all it made me happy that I stuck with it till the very sweet end. Their journey was worth all that cake, all that tea and all that effort. Hokago Tea Time may have never been the same after Ritsu, Mugi, Mio and Yui graduated, but you can still find them playing and singing joyously until they can't play or sing anymore; in the hearts of those who were touched by their legacy and the hearts of fans of the show across the world. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10): Not the most complicated show, but a heartwarming masterpiece.",

            "content": "Under the glaring eyes of the public masses, the K-On series is predominantly a show about five moe girls who do nothing but drink tea and eat cakes. While this is certainly true, there's something profound that lies beyond the reach of naked eye.\r\nPlease bear with me here as I explain why people view this show so negatively \u2014 I'll make it worth your while.\r\nMost people overlook K-On due to its lack of substance and proper character development. Unfortunately, this is true \u2014 the story contains little to no significant conflicts that lead to a noticeable change in most, if not any, of the characters.The characters also lack major inspiration and represent common archetypes in the slice of life/moe genre.\\n\\n\r\nAnother major point that people often bring up is the lack of music. Instead of conducting practices, looking for ways to improve, and holding amazing concerts with memorable music, the five members of the Light Music Club instead sit around drinking tea and eating confectioneries all day long. On the off chance that the club does decide to play music, the songs, while good, are not too different from common J-Pop songs and their chord progressions. No one particular song stands out as \"amazing\", and the lyrics are regrettably childish.\\n\\n\r\nHOWEVER...what most people fail to realize is that it is because of this particular lack of complexity that K-On really shines.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot doesn't try to be a Steins;Gate. The drama doesn't try to be a CLANNAD ~AFTER STORY~. The music doesn't try to be a Beck. The list goes on and on, but the point is, relative to the epic nature that many shows (even slice of life shows such as Toradora!) try to achieve, K-On is quite normal.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot merely revolves around a group of five girls living a (relatively) normal and peaceful high school life. The Light Music Club was actually never about playing in Budokan or even playing good music at all. Music was simply a shared interest, a coincidence, even (considering how the characters all came to met in the first season) that brought about a pleasant bundle of memories and experiences that further consolidated their friendships with one another.\\n\\n\r\n(S1 Mini-Spoiler) A scene during the first season that perfectly encapsulates this theme is when Azusa (the youngest of the club) first joins the club. She notes that while the Light Music Club plays lackluster music fraught with countless mistakes, there's something undeniably compelling about the way that they played that she couldn't pull herself away from.\\n\\n\r\nThus, the very selling point of K-On as an anime is its normality. Through its normality, K-On beautifully portrays the importance of friendship and its value over fame and/or materialistic gain. This theme becomes ever so evident as the idea of graduation draws nearer and nearer with each passing moment. Although this is something I'd like to discuss in greater detail, in fear of stepping on a spoiler landmine, I'll avoid doing so.\\n\\n\r\nNow that that's all done and over with, let's discuss the more simple joys and fun to be had in the show.\\n\\n\r\nAs expected of KyoAni, the animation of the show is done very well. The characters achieve exactly what they are meant to achieve as a part of the moe genre \u2014 they're cute. Although this may turn some people off, there is no denying the fact that the show does exactly what it is called to do.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I found the finer points of the animation to be present in something else. All/most of the instruments shown throughout the series are based off of real life models (albeit not named for obvious reasons), and the animation within the music sequences are executed to a high degree of detail.\\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, real life references such as the Natsu-Fes allowed me to pick up more information about Japanese culture, something I take great joy in doing (similar to how Oreimo sheds some light on Comiket and the otaku culture). As a fellow musician, I greatly appreciated this high attention to detail and made the anime just that much more enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nAt this point in time, it may sound like I'm singing this show's praises, since there are quite a few to be had. Nevertheless, K-On is not without its flaws.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot, despite containing such a good theme, has slightly twisted pacing due to the existence of the first season. The first season rushes through the first two years of high school in a mere twelve episodes, while the second season expands the final year (Japan only has three) over a course of twenty-four episodes (and a few specials). Although this isn't a major problem, it would have been preferable to see more consistency to the pacing of the plot over the course of both seasons.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedic element in the show is also somewhat iffy. While it is good that the comedy is always placed at the appropriate time and with a good frequency (not overwhelming, not lacking), a small number of jokes became a little too repetitive for my own enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION:\\n\\n\r\nThis review has sort of been all over the place, so I'll neatly bring my review to an end with the next few paragraphs. However, my following scores may surprise you, so I hope you're patient enough to read this until the very end.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY (10%) \u2014 4.7/10\\n\\n\r\nAt this point, you'll be wondering why I touted the profundity of the themes present in the story and only gave it such a low score. This is because I believe that the discovery of themes is highly subjective and is all a part of your own PERSONAL enjoyment. The story of K-On is, in itself, quite bland. However, as I have said, it doesn't have to be, which is why it is only worth 10% of the overall score.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS (15%) \u2014 4.9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe same reasoning for the story above applies here as well. The characters, by themselves, lack development (individually or collectively) and are typical tropes found within the slice of life/moe genre. That having been said, the characters are not the meat of the show and thus also are only worth 10% of the overall score. It receives a higher score than the story because despite being clich\u00e9, they are still respectable models of what moe characters should be like, and their interactions with one another are enjoyable to watch and well executed enough to consolidate the idea of friendship.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION (20%) \u2014 7.6/10\\n\\n\r\nThere's not much to be said here. Kyoto Animation matches and surpasses expectations. They not only succeeded in drawing cute/moe characters that fit their equally cute/moe personalities, but also paid great attention to detail when it came to instruments or music sequences, something that should appeal to other musicians.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (25%) \u2014 7.7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe reasoning for STORY and CHARACTERS applies here for the final time, but not to the same extent. Not much of the BGM from the OST was memorable, and the insert songs performed by the main characters were infrequent and not too uncommon (in relation to J-Pop). The lyrics of such songs are also too outlandish for conventional enjoyment. The openings and endings are well animated sequences with music that very well fit the hyperactive tone of the show.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT (30%) \u2014 8.3/10\\n\\n\r\nNow, to those who are still confused by rather contradictory grading style, let me explain it in full detail here. I believe that the art of reviewing is an unavoidably subjective attempt to objectify the subjective; in consequence, this means that my review is not the absolute truth out there. It is merely a personal attempt to express my opinions on a particular form of media.\\n\\n\r\nHence, even if I say that the plot only merits a 4.8/10, people can feel free to disagree with me, click the \"Not Helpful\" button, and merrily move on with their lives. I'm merely stating that in relation to other anime that I've seen, K-On does not have a compelling plot or enticing characters, but that I placed little emphasis on these two aspects while I was watching the show. If you are a person who is a heavily plot or character driven individual, then I'm merely trying to make clear that this may not be the show for you.\\n\\n\r\nNow...with that out of the way...\\n\\n\r\nDespite the flaws, I still enjoyed the hell out of this show. The themes that I perceived from the series seemed very profound, particularly because my graduation from high school was only two months ago. References to culture and music were admirable, the cute/rapid/erratic nature of the characters were thoroughly enjoyable, and the innocent performances were catchy, to say the very least.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL (100%) \u2014 7.1/10\\n\\n\r\nK-On is definitely not a show for everyone to enjoy, much like this review. Those who place significant emphasis on heavy plot, complex characters (and specifically their development), and deep music won't get as much out of the show as I did. The show's main appeal is its cute, wacky, sweet nature...and perhaps even its diversity of confectioneries.\\n\\n\r\nSo pour yourself a cup of tea and get ready for the relaxed, fluffy splendor that is K-On.",

            "content": "I had a smile on my face the entire time of watching this.\r\nI know there's people who say that this series has too much \"moe\" but honestly, I feel that it's the best blend of cute and serious when it needs to be. \r\nThe story is about four seniors in high school who are close to graduation. They are in a small club called the Light Music Club, and are joined with another girl named Azuza. The five of them make up the LMC. Over the progression of the show you get to hear the differences in their music performance, and you really get tosee the slice of life in action. While the story is very simple, it holds a lot of emotion and spontaneous action that really makes this show all the more interesting. There's only so much you can put into an anime about five high school girls that are in a music club. And they really do put just enough content to make the story as a whole, great.\\n\\n\r\nI'm a huge fan of the music and art that this anime has. I love all of the OP's and have all of them stuck in my head for days after hearing them. The art style is what you would expect from this studio, excellence. There's not a single time I was let down with what I was seeing.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the biggest highlight of this show. They all have such a good vibe to them, and make me want to watch the show more, even if I was bored during one scene or the next. The really interesting thing that this anime does is it's spontaneous nature. The characters seem to have a really nice flow with what they say and do. You could see them sitting at their table drinking tea, then all of a sudden you will see something out of the ordinary happen. The characters are very impromptu. I really liked how they showed more of Mugi, since the first season she was kinda in the background for the most part. And I really like how they switched the view more to Azuza toward the end of the season; how she saw everything unfold slowly as the graduation came to a close. All of the characters have very interesting backgrounds and personalities that are like-able. Yui may be a bit over the top sometimes, but the rest are, like I said, a perfect blend of cute and serious when need be.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime is a trip. I have a real connection with the characters and I really do relate with this show even on a personal level. I just graduated myself and to see this happen again for characters that I have come to love, it's definitely a new view to how graduation should be. I also would love to say that the music scene in this anime is really alive. I love all of the attention to detail that they put in. Specially using real-life brand names like Yamaha. It's even more fun since I make some music too.\\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend this anime to anyone that wants a show they can sit back and relax to, while having a good smile and some laughs. Ignore the people who say that this show is \"moe trash\" and just respect it for what it has to offer. It's truly a great show.",

If you want something else don't touch this show. If you've seen the first season, it pretty much doesn't change. There's not a lot I can really say other than this unless something drastically changed in the last 8 episodes.\r\nCould it have had a story? Definitely. Did it? Well, from what I've seen, no. I cannot be bothered to finish it. That's how bored I am. This is about a group of girls trying to get better, enjoying their new-foundhobby and aspiring to get their big break, right? Unless I misinterpreted it? Oh wait, no it's not, because it's a bunch of moe blob. Instead of focusing on anything relevant to the premise we get stuff like... I don't know... moe blobs getting lost in a marathon. Moe blobs failing their tests. Moe blobs passing their tests. Yay we're at training camp, time to go to the beach. Wow I'm... err... so enthralled by this plot development. Honest.\\n\\n\r\nI'm putting about as much effort into this review as they did into its story writing. I don't care how cute the girls are, I just want plot development - and if you tell me \"that's not what this show is for\" I'm going to hurt you. If you're going to create a show full of moe blobs and little story don't give it a premise that might suggest otherwise. At least then I won't touch it. I'm looking at you, Yuru Yuri. I enjoy looking at cute girls but I enjoy plot development even more.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe it changes in the last eight episodes. I doubt it though. Feel free to shout at me if it does, maybe I'll consider finishing it then. I'm possibly being too harsh but oh well, it's almost 3:15am, I don't care.\\n\\n\r\nSummary:\\n\r\ntl;dr nothing happens moe moe moe Ritsu sucks.

            "content": "(This review includes my opinions on the first season as well, as it seems pointless to split it up.)\r\nNever before have a cringed so many times at a show that I enjoyed in my entire life. Now, obviously this is kind of a paradoxical statement so allow me to explain.\r\nK-On! has pretty much no over arching plot until it comes time for the school festivals or the end of the series, and it is jam packed with overly cutesy characters doing ditsy things that kind of just make me want to stop watching. But no matter how ditsy the characters were, or how pointless anepisode plot was, or how many times I cringed, I enjoyed K-On! from start to finish.\\n\\n\r\nNow, this isn't to say that the show is so good that I can look past it's flaws altogether, because no show is. But, I can make a great deal of exceptions with a show like K-On! for one reason or another. K-On! may not be the best anime ever, not by a long shot, but it has it's own unique style and charm that makes it so enjoyable to watch. Its the type of show that doesn't really need a big overarching plot like say Fullmetal Alchemist or Mirai Nikki. It's just a nice happy go lucky slice of life show that will have you smiling at least once or twice, even if you are dead set against cutesy stuff. I mean hell, if it could get me, a 19 year old uptight guy to laugh and smile and say d'aww, I'm pretty sure it could have that affect on anyone. That is of course until you get to the last few episodes when it feels like the show has formed a lance made of pure concentrated sadness and threw it right through your very heart and soul, well at least that's how I felt. But the OVAs and movie bring the smiles and cutesy stuff back to make the ending very bitter sweet, which is something I rather enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves aren't really that multidimensional to be honest. I mean of the five mains you have the; ditsy girl with her head in the clouds, the forgetful tomboy, the shy straight A student, the rich airhead (who actually isn't full of herself for once), and the uptight one who has to act as the straight man for at least 3 out of her 4 senpais. I'm not going to pretend that these characters are deep and emotional, but they serve their purpose well enough for what the show is, so it doesn't really bother me. In fact I don't find that the characters have to be that multidimensional in a show like K-On! and the few times the characters deviate from their usual selves for the episodes plot, it adds an interesting new dynamic to them so they don't feel so plain.\\n\\n\r\nGiven that the show is all about music you would hope that there are plenty of good songs in it, and there are. I mean, unless of course you weren't expecting corny cutesy lyrics, then it might bother you. But honestly, when you ignore how cheesy the lyrics are, which I would imagine are much more, for lack of a better term, sensical in Japanese than they are when they are translated into their English equivalent, the songs are quite entertaining. One that really stands out to me is the a one they write for one of the characters towards the end of the show, not to give too much away, which is probably the most meaningful (this is where that lance of sadness I talked about earlier strikes you, well one of the times it does at least.)\\n\\n\r\nHowever, when you get down to it, my opinion is, and always has been that the most important factor in how much you like a show is your enjoyment. And personally, I had a lot of fun watching K-On! Yes, I cringed quite a lot, yes the lack of plot was obvious, and yes some of the actions of the characters were pretty stupid, but K-On! is so happy-go-lucky that I can't help but feeling good when I'm watching it.\\n\\n\r\nSo, while K-On! might not be the greatest thing I've ever seen, but it has a style and charm all it's own that make it so much fun to watch, even for a uptight 19 year old college guy.",

            "content": "It is, without a doubt, the aim of every good show to create not only good relationships between the characters of a show, but also to to create a good relationship between the viewer and the characters of the show itself. This way, the viewers can easily empathize with the characters while getting attached to them, thus also feeling connected to the show and being easily able to like it. You want to see a good example of this phenomenon?  Take a look at K-On!!, and you may find the answer.\r\nI can say for sure that there hasn't been many shows over the pastdecade that caused as much conflicts among its viewers as K-On!! did. With K-On!! being prescribed as being a simple moeblob show without any depth or whatsoever, the show naturally haven't had only fans. Lots of haters are still around when it comes to K-On!!, but, still, the show also has got its own fanbase, which is, in addition, quite huge.  For me, it has been a real pleasure to watch K-On!!, given that it does bring out the little silly fangirl in me, which is quite unusual, since I'm a 17 year-old guy.\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9.9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nIt isn't a real secret that the story isn't necessarily one of the strong points of K-On!! Besides, it should be an obvious, given fact that you can't expect a great and thrilling story by a simple slice of life series, which is, in addition, set in High School. That's pretty much the epitome of ac\\n\r\n stereotypical series if it wasn't for the musical aspect. In comparison to other series that are set in High School, the musical aspect brings a lot of fresh air to the rather ordinary setting, along with the challenges that are faced by the five girls.\\n\r\nStill, you shouldn't expect any tremendous plot twists, which is, in fact, a really positive aspect! After all, this series is meant to be calming and reassuring, thus a lot of plot twists would rather ruin the atmosphere than helping to create it. Some points of the plot still don't seem realistic as they are supposed to be in this SoL-series, but this is an excusable fact. Because of all the points I've just mentioned, the story may seem a little repetitive after a certain point, but, given that you should know by now that the main concept of this series is 'cute girls doing cute things', the story won't get extremely boring as long as you can enjoy this particular point of the story.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nI think that I can surely say that the art style is one of the most arguable points of the whole show. Why, you ask? Of course I'm talking about the really arguable character designs, which are considered extremely 'moe' by a lot of people. After all, this is one of the points why K-On!! is rather well-known among people who watch anime. \\n\r\nI'm not going to rant about the character designs for a long time (simply because this is something everyone needs to decide for himself, though you should also consider that the show was produced \u2013 more or less \u2013 during the peek of the 'moe' hype). But I'd still like to express my own personal view about the character design, which is, as you might have expected from my rating, quite positive. After all, the rather 'moe-ish' style of the characters perfectly fits the general cozy, comfy atmosphere of K-On!! This sort of character design may not fit other shows, but it is, without a doubt, the best thing that could happen to K-On!!. If the characters were designed in another way, the show would've lost a lot of its cozy appeal. Still, it is quite understandable if you dislike the character design, but keep in mind that it is the perfect fit for a show that is as cozy as a fire in a chimney on a cold winter day.\\n\r\nAside from that, the animation quality is simply flawless, just as expected from Kyoto Animation. There weren't many animation errors (I noticed one error, as far as I remember) and the backgrounds are obviously really well-drawn. But who did actually expect a different, worse result?\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9.5/10\\n\r\nBefore you attack me with swords for this rating, I'd like to explain my opinion.\\n\r\nAfter all, K-On!! is \u2013 more or less \u2013 a music anime, hence it should be natural natural to expect a lot of good soundtracks. And K-On!! did deliver. While the music surely doesn't fit everyone's tastes (simply because the OSTs as well as the EDs and the OPs are as overly cute as the characters are), it does indeed fit my personal taste. Very positively outstanding is the fact that all the soundtracks also contribute a lot to the general comfy atmosphere of the series, with the great interaction of all the instruments and the undeniably cute lyrics, which are \u2013 at least to me \u2013 sometimes scarily prepossessing. In contrast, other songs do seem rather weird (in particular the lyrics of some songs), though they do still serve their purpose: after all, this is is a SoL, thus the lyrics of a song can also describe things taken straight from life!\\n\r\nOne of the rather negative points is the fact that we, as the viewers, can't hear music performed by Hokago Tea Time each episode, though this may also be a good thing, given that the music would eventually sound recycled if we got to hear full performances from HTT each episode.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nThe character section is \u2013 without a doubt \u2013 one of the strong points of the show and surely one of the reasons for the popularity of K-On!!\\n\r\nIf you watched at least 5 shows in your entire life, you should probably be aware of the fact that people usually enjoy a series more if they are attached to the characters, their emotions, and all the problems they have to face, no matter how small they may seem. This is surely one of the stronger points of K-On!!, at least in my case. I am aware of the fact that some people may dislike all the characters, but I got attached to the characters during this second season, which is the main reason for my high rating. \\n\r\nYet another reason for my rather high rating is the  - in comparison to the first season \u2013 visibly growth of the characters, even Yui gets at least a little more mature during her third year in High School. The character development surely isn't as great and meaningful as it is in other series, but it is there, which I consider a significant improvement in comparison to the first season. (n comparison to other series, it is very nice to see almost every single of our main characters getting a similar treatment (in terms of character development), not a single character gets 'left behind' (well, beside Mugi). This sort of character development also causes the great in-between character interaction with thoroughly changing and developing relationships that become more and more meaningful with each episode.\\n\r\nObviously K-On!! doesn't follow the typical 'protagonist/antagonist' scheme, which is a fact you should know just b looking at the artstyle. Instead of characters being shown only in a negative or in a positive way to the viewer, you get to see them doing both silly and thoughtful things, more or less meaningful ones, and interesting and rather boring things. Overall I am positively surprised by the fact that a great diversity of different sides of the characters is shown.\\n\r\nSummed up, the characters may not be very different at all, but the way K-On!! portrays its characters is more than enough to make you attached to them (at least in my case).\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9.9/10\\n\r\nThis section of my review is a very special one for K-On!!, given that the enjoyment manifests itself in a completely different way than it does in other shows.\\n\r\nUsually you watch a show knowing that you can expect either a good story, or lots of action or other extremely interesting and unique things. Based on this fact you create yourself an image of the show, expecting what you might enjoy and what you rather won't enjoy. But K-On!! is different: The enjoyment doesn't come from huge fights or a great story. It is the bare fact that you can simply lean back, relax and enjoy to see 'cute girls doing cute things' that makes the show enjoyable, as long as you are able to enjoy this sort of show. Really, you should know that you can't expect more than that if you plan to watch K-On!! Oddly enough, this is literally everything this show needs, at least for me, given that this is everything I expected. This sort of enjoyment also combines (PASST ZU) very well with the overly cute art style and the overly cute music style of HTT. K-On!! makes you feel at least a little reassured, which provides \u2013 at least for me \u2013 a lot of enjoyment. Besides, you may as well be able to enjoy each character for their own weaknesses and strengths: No matter whether it is Yui's incomprehensible laziness, Mio's seemingly boundless shyness or even Mugi's great tea: every single character contributes its own part for creating the whole story that it is (mainly) filled by positive emotions.\\n\r\nStill, this show also makes you reminisce a little bit about your own life. How so? Obviously it doesn't emphasize on saving the world or achieving something extremely meaningful, but it does emphasize on something even more important: The value of friendship!\\n\r\nYeah, I know that this sounded really cheesy, so what? K-On!! makes you value friendship a lot more, since it does show what every single group of good friends is capable of doing. Not in the stereotypical 'the power of friendship'-way, but rather just by showing how much fun you can have in your everyday life with your friends and how they're able to support you, no matter what happens. And isn't this why you need friends?\\n\r\nYet another lesson given by the show is the knowledge how great it is to give others inspiration. After all, you do feel better if you know that you'll be remembered by others. \\n\\n\r\ntl;dr: The characters and the atmosphere they create make the show enjoyable, not the storyline, so if you don't enjoy the characters, I highly recommend you to watch something else.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nIt is undeniable that K-On!! has caused and will cause lots of controversial discussions among all anime fans. The character design alone provides enough for weekly discussions, let alone the storyline. Still: K-On!! provided me with lots of fun, laughter, and even lots and lots of emotions towards the end (simply because I felt connected to the characters and their problems). The series may not fit everyone's tastes, but it still provides lots of fun for these who get easily attached to the characters while being able to ignore the rather weak storyline.\\n\\n\r\nAnd always remember: \u201cFun things are fun!\u201d (Yui Hirasawa)",

            "content": "Disclaimer: This is a review of both seasons of K-ON!.\r\n\tWhy did I decide to watch this series? Like many people who now either absolutely love or despise it, I watched out of curiosity. I wanted to see if a moe anime show like this could really sink its hooks into me. I can say now beyond a shadow of a doubt that the answer to that question is a resounding yet somewhat embarrassed yes. This show is a textbook definition of guilty pleasure- something that you derive great pleasure from despite knowing it is comprised of the most superfluous ingredients. In this case, I amdiscussing an anime series that is considered by some to embody many of the problems of the anime genre. The purpose of the show is undoubtedly watching cute girls hang out and get into funny situations. The appeal of the show is the girls. The show is discreetly targeted at obsessive \"otaku\" types who drool over their favorite anime girl, yet provides almost no moments of overt \"fan-service\", leading one to be able to view it with a complete sense of innocence. This is probably the reason why it is so popular: It seamlessly masks it's questionable purpose with sincere, heartfelt character interactions, loving attention to detail, and even gasp!\u2026 astonishing subtlety.\\n\r\n\tMake no mistake, the overarching \"plot\" of K-ON! is paper thin. Basically, some high school girls decide to start a band in their after school music club. The show chronicles the various adventures and exploits of these five girls as they progress through high school and gain recognition for their music. However, more than anything, it is just them goofing off- they have an unbelievably bad work ethic but somehow (humorously) become virtuoso musicians very quickly. For a show that claims to be largely about music, this is somewhat of a misnomer. Sure, there are moments of the show that cleverly make nods to the music industry and to the rock and roll culture and artistic process, but these are far outweighed by the moments of idle chatting, having tea, laughing, and thinking about possibly practicing. As you might guess, this starts off being extremely boring. However, once you get past the first few episodes and ease into the flow of things, the show begins to reveal its true strengths- its characters and it's easy-going, amiable air.\\n\r\n\tThe series excels here because it's characters are so likable and the way that they interact is realistic, full of funny and heartfelt moments, and just plain amusing. Like any show with multidimensional characters, you don't really get the appeal right away. For me it took nearly 13 episodes. I only really started to realize I was having a great time once the first season was coming to a close. It was one of those moments where I realized I had a huge grin on my face whenever I was watching- which is a great compliment to any show. Despite the show being slow moving and low on actual substance, I found myself eager to return to the laid-back and sunny world of K-ON! to spend time with Yui, Mio, Ritsu, Mugi and Azusa. The subtle way in which they change from cookie cutter character archetypes to believable and lovable people is the single best thing about the show. By the end of it all, you will be truly sad to part with them.\\n\r\n\tAnother thing that really helps the show is that is is expertly crafted- with animation quality similar to The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya and subtle differences in characters movements and facial expressions, the art is neat and consistent if not exactly astonishing. There are some very beautiful set piece moments, many of which are found in the afternoon-sun-drenched school halls. In fact, the school itself has an astonishing amount of atmosphere and believability, giving it a sort of character of it's own.\\n\r\n\tLike I said, for a show centered around the idea of a school band, the music is not what you might expect. This is not a rock and roll soundtrack ala FLCL. The only times you ever really hear the band play is their big performances, which are few and far between. Their songs are good J-Pop style rockers but don't even appear in their full versions usually. In addition, there are the OP and ED themes, which are extremely catchy and spastic. The kind of things that literally will not leave your head. It was for this reason that I downloaded the soundtracks and came to realize that the music is actually quite good. Long story short, I'm a little confused on why all of these great rock songs were composed for the show and then used as minimally as possible, in favor of the generic sounding background music that accompanies most scenes. I realize that the unobtrusive music contributes to the relaxed drawl of the show but it just seems like untapped potential.\\n\r\n\tSimilarly, my single biggest gripe with K-ON! is that while the show is likable with its lack of urgency and tendency to play around, I wish there would have been more progression and emphasis on the group as a band. It would have been nice to see them actually write and compose the songs, practice and record together, see their live interplay, and witness all of the struggles and obstacles that musicians encounter. Instead, we get lots of tea parties, shopping, sleepovers, school activities and walking around chatting it up. I guess you could make the argument that the band is just a hobby to them and thus they do not dedicate much time to it but dammit, like Azusa, I wish they would!\\n\r\n\tTo conclude, K-ON! impressed and entertained me. I am legitimately psyched for the movie (which they better be f'ing making). In the end, the show is like the the cakes that the girls of the light music club enjoy so much- light and  sweet without much nutritional value, yet totally worth it. And for the record, this show does not represent anything wrong with the anime genre. These are not generic characters just acting out moe cliches. In fact, the show is relatively light of cliches compared to highly regarded shows such as say, Azumanga Daioh. So, call me part of the problem or whatever, but I found K-ON! to be good fun. Give it a try and you might just find it to be your cup of tea\u2026 sorry;)",

Everything about them and their interactions with one another just clicks together. The awesome storyline, soundtracks and artwork complement one another to create a one of a kind masterpiece.\r\nThis is perhaps one of the finest SOL/MOE shows to have existed whichset the standard for similar types of shows to follow.",

            "content": "This review will review both s1 and s2 of k-on,but mainly s2,minor spoiler of the beginning episodes in S2 ahead! \r\nI remembered that when I was young, I saw K-on was on the TV, the public seemed to be very interested in it. At that moment, I thought it was just another \"cute girls doing cute things\" shows. It didn't draw any of my attention at all. \r\nAfter a few years, I was pulled by someone's recommendation.Saying that it's much better than Love Live. I decided to give it a try.\r\nClearly,I realised that my previous statement was wrong. \r\nK-on is one of those shows that'strying to turn something ordinary into masterpiece.As from what I have heard, the manga was just mediocre,it just a mixture of generic short stories.While the anime itself doesn't feel that way at all.Although it still stay on slice of life and the theme \"light and flurry\",the story is very descriptive and interesting as well. Most of the episodes in K-on are very generic, but it still have story and character development as time goes on. Taking S2 as an example,you can see main characters talking about graduation and express their inner feelings about  the future of K-on and their precious highschool life is going to pass away. Watching this, it's kinda recall my highschool life.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition,friendship is described pretty well,Ritsu always play planks on Moi.Yui is lazy and needs help all the time. While Moi and Azusa are sometime serious, but always being aroused by cakes.Indeed this is one of the most Interesting character combination I have ever seen, yet this not only increase my enjoyment in this show, but also showing that this show has high character individuality.Hence,the theme \"light and flurry\" is highly promoted.\\n\\n\r\nOK, back to S2.\\n\\n\r\nS2 continued the story of S1.For K-on, it's not that far until members going to be graduated.Of course, like S1,it inserted lots of hilarious slice of life stories.I really like that K-on is trying to become \"semi-unrealistic\",I mean who's going to have so much chance to going for trips and get free tickets to visit places, but I know this is trying bring me to the happiest moments of highschool life.While bringing you to happiness,thinking about the episodes passed,graduation is coming fast. Clearly, at the end I was busted into tears.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that's worth to mention is about the turtle added in s2,this side character added a lot of elements in this show,like the overall story and enjoyment,theres more side stories to talk about and I enjoyed the moment that watching K-on members taking care of it. It feels more like K-on is talking music room as their home and it's much more heart-warming,the feeling is completely in a different level.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's a really descriptive and comedy slice of life show.\\n\\n\r\nAt last,lets talk about animation and sound. \\n\\n\r\nThe character design is simple but decent, fits the theme \"light and flurry\" well. I'm not expecting masterart in this show, since it's a slice of life show,so nothing much to mention.Im kinda impressed by the sound in this show, the instruments sound are pretty realistic and there's a variety of soundtracks used in this show. Songs are inserted very well with the story, like during the band show and at the end. \\n\\n\r\nIf you're interested in slice of life shows,music and moe girls, this show is pretty suitable for you,so give it a try. Even though this show is pretty old, it's still pretty good to watch today.",

            "content": "K-ON!! is the epitome of \"moe blob\" anime; one which got so many other similar series to start, and is also the No.1 selling anime for a long time... While I agree that the colossal amount of \"moe\" based series is hurting the industry, I must say that K-ON!! represent one of the best in this saturated genre.\r\nIt's a bit sad that the second season hardly touches on the music aspect of the series as compared to the first season, as I feel that it's one of the nicer part of the series, especially the live concerts and the original music the club had. Thisseason focuses almost entirely on the comedy, slice-of-life, and story parts of series, but I guess this is what the larger part of the market wants to see. It's sad that the series lost it's unique trait that allows me to call it a anime of music genre, somewhere along the line of BECK and Nodame.\\n\\n\r\nWhat's good about this season however, is the HUGE improvements on the production quality of the show. Not that the first season is shabby, but it seems that they've managed to perfect every single part of the show. The difference in the directing of the series is so great I could taste the budget they've put into this franchise... Kyoani knows where to put their money where it's worth. It's not like there isn't any boring parts of the series, after all they had to put one year of the story's timeline into 26 episodes, where else they had put two years into the first season's 13 episodes... I suppose they wanna milk it for all it's worth... so there's a side effect of some parts being particularly boring, but it's not like there's any unenjoyable episodes. K-ON!! always managed to put a stupid grin on my face everytime I watch it.\\n\\n\r\nI don't think I need to talk about the animation quality. Aki Toyosaki's two new OP's are a bit too cute for the general public, but I do find them very interesting. But they can't be compared to Youko Hisaka's two ED's, which are simply awesome.\\n\\n\r\nOf course K-ON!! isn't for everyone, but it's definetely the best of it's genre. People who are looking for strong plot lines and twists, or strong character developments, K-ON!! isn't something they're looking for. Unless the \"moe blob\" genre turns your stomach, you must give this a try.\\n\\n\r\nPlot/Concept: Awesome!\\n\r\nStory Style: Awesome!\\n\r\nAudio/Visual: Superb!\\n\r\nValue: 10",

            "content": "If you've never heard of K-On!, the show is basically this: an anime in the slice-of-life moe genre (Lucky Star) with no main plot but a group of teenage girls that are well... Teenage girls. They go to school, study, eat and sleep. Oh yeah, and they're all part of a band. While music itself isn't the main focus of the series, that isn't necessarily a bad thing. The anime makes up for its lack of a plot by showcasing the simplicity of life. The anime shows that life isn't a boring thing. The laughs and tears you shed atwork, school or home is what makes life interesting.\\n\\n\r\n     K-On!! stays true to it's predecessor. It is a plotless 26 episodes of overpowering moe-ness. That being said, it has improved on it's original run on all fronts.\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nStory: 6 for plot, 7 for characters\\n\r\n-\\n\r\n     While there is no main plot, K-On uses the set up of 5 teenage girls and their ventures with their school's keion club (light music club). Aside from maybe a couple what you could call legitimate plot arcs, the anime is very episodic. It uses the sitcom based setup where the only thing the same about every episode is the characters. \\n\r\n     Except for one major difference. Time goes by and the chronology is very apparent. One major focus of the anime is the fact that 4/5 of the members are seniors and will be graduating from high school life into the real world once the school year ends. This factor adds a surprising amount of character development, mainly with Azusa, and less with Sawako, Mio and the others.\\n\r\n     About the characters, they all portray different stereotypes in school and in anime. Yui, the airheaded girl, Ritsu, the eccentric tomboy-ish leader, Mio, the pretty and shy girl, Mugi, the kind, gentle hearted rich girl, Azusa, the loli (as if Yui wasn't enough) mascot (mind you, her character is also sort of a pseudo Mio), and last but not least, bipolar Sawa-chan. The characters are done well enough and have very distinct personalities. Best of all, they were produced very well in terms of art and voice acting (sub is 3948234x better trust me, as 75% of my anime list was watched in dub).\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nProduction: 9 for art, 10 for sound\\n\r\n-\\n\r\n     As Kyoto Animation has done before with two other juggernauts of the school life genre (Clannad, and Lucky Star), K-On brings a unique art style that like the others, is still done amazingly. The character designs were extremely well done, and the attention to detail is also surprisingly good.\\n\r\n     The sound is a masterpiece in every aspect. The voice acting is done with voices that fit their roles perfectly, and while the songs may not seem perfect, they are done to resemble a high school pop band, with catchy melodies, and an amateur sound. This aspect has been done to a high level as believe it or not, the OST was recorded by the voice actors themselves. They learned how to play their instruments as their characters did, and I must say I'm pretty impressed.\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\n-\\n\r\n     Enjoyment is the main purpose of the slice-of-life moe genre. There isn't a deep plot, it isn't overflowing in sad moments, but it's enjoyable. Very enjoyable at that. I don't have much to say other than you need to experience this yourself.\\n\r\n-\\n\r\n     How did K-On!! surpass it's first season? Every aspect of the anime improved just a little bit, to say the least. That was enough to bump my rating from a 6 to an 8 across seasons.",

            "content": "[Story: 7.0] I initially considered K-ON (season 1 at that time) as being the weaker works by KyoAni. Well, I'm going to take that back. The previous season was by no means terrible, but it certainly was not that spectacular; it was just mildly enjoyable. Season 2 however, turned out to be an improvement. For one thing, this season is more than just the girls skiving around being moe. There's more content and more events going on. In particular, the impressive part of the series lies in the last few episodes, where most of the girls are about to graduate.\r\nMy only complaint is that theyaren;t doing much music related stuff. After all, the studio has been shown to put in massive amount of effort in things such as the accuracy of the instruments. Some fans will point out that music isn't exactly the main focus and that it's more about the girls enjoying themselves. I agree, however, it was a bit of a wasted potential to not see them have actual, proper practice sessions despite being graced with such expensive instruments. Besides, wouldn't them practicing together also help in the portrayal of their bonds? Still, the things like the concerts are great.\\n\\n\r\n[Characters: 7.5] Season 1 was just decent because the series was more about displaying as much as possible of the various gimmicks like the moe factor and such. The sequel moves away from it considerably, choosing to go for the more slice-of-life approach. Furthermore, although the characters aren't exactly the most original, there is nonetheless evident characterization beyond their initial basic archetypes. For example, there's Azusa growing attached to the club, and later realizes the impending loneliness that will occur after the other girls graduate. In short, it's not just about the girls being cutesy, it had some heartwarming moments as well, with the series exploring their friendship and relationship with several other people like their teacher and so on. On that note, I mentioned in my review for season 1 how Sawako exists mainly as a plot device to get the girls to cosplay. In this season, the series chose to focus on her position as someone who, beneath the childish and easy-going nature, is a teacher who genuinely cares for her students. The events and ideas in K-ON may be common and predictable, but the directing style and pacing prevents it from becoming a bore.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, I like how KyoAni took the effort to include the other classmates into the interactions (creating new materials that wasn't originally available in the 4koma). Yes, the main girls are the protagonists, but the world certainly doesn't revolve around them just because they are the lead characters.\\n\\n\r\n[Art: 9.0] Cute girls to KyoAni is what robots are to Sunrise; it's their trademark. And in the current cute girl trend, saying that KyoAni is successful is a mere understatement. Also, they seem to have stepped up the art quality in this season. As with the previous season, the animations for the ending themes are appealing.\\n\\n\r\n[Music: 9.0] The OP didn't really appeal to me. The EDs, No, Thank You! and Listen! on the other hand, are absolutely fantastic and so are the various inserts. The bgms are simplistic but fits the series just fine. Again, it would be nice if they actually had more practice sessions.\\n\\n\r\n[Summary] On a final note, we often make fun of studios when the adaptations are not as good as the source material (lol DEEN), but seldom do we do the reverse. For contrast, look at Minami-ke. The manga is also another simple slice-of-life title. While season 1 by studio Doumu was popular, the second season by studio Asread was less so. Kyoto Animation is thus commendable in how it managed to take a simple 4koma and expand it to obtain such levels of achievements. Again, I don't see myself as a huge fan of K-ON and I think that it is rather overrated, but then it's not the first time the fandom has taken to exaggerated extols. Nevertheless, as far as a slice-of-life series go, I don't mind admitting that this second season is pleasant to watch.\\n\r\nPersonal Overall Rating: 8.0\\n",

            "content": "Here are the following reasons why K-On!! got a new season.. \r\n1) Weaboos on the internet were whining for a new season\r\n2) Whoever created the show wanted to pull a clef-er (pun intended) heist in our pockets\r\nOR\r\n3) The creators were getting death threats that they need to make a new season.\r\nWell, whatever is the reason, I don't care because the new season blasted the last season out of the water. \r\nStory: (8/10)\r\nThe story continues from the first K-On!. It is now focused on the final year of high school for the Light Music Club Members. \r\nJust like the last season, the story is very simpleand it's just cute girls doing cute things but this time, they're way more cuter.\\n\r\nDoes this show even have a plot you ask? Yea, I don't think so but that shouldn't really bother you. There's also no story/plot development which also didn't bother me. Well, at the last few episodes, it did have some plot development. The story pacing in the last season was very fast and it had a lot of time skips because they were only allowed to air 12 episodes. This time, they were allowed 24 episodes so the pacing is now normal (25 and 26 if you count the extra episode and 27 if you count the OVA). There is still some time skips but the gap ain't that huge. \\n\r\nPrepare some tissues in Ep. 24 because the last 8 minutes of that episode will make you sad, cry or probably shed a tear. Although, the last 8 minutes of episode 24 felt like it was randomly dropped in the show at first but everything was explained in the movie. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: (9/10)\\n\r\nThe Animation is way better and more beautiful than the last season. You can actually see the details on the road, houses, school, etc. The lighting is also a lot better. The character designs are a bit better than the first one. They still use the cliche facial expressions but if you watched the first season then you should gotten used to it bu now. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: (10/10)\\n\r\nJust like the first season, the show is still focused on music. This time, the music used in the show and the OP/ED is a lot better than the first season.  The show also re-used some songs from the first season. The big example is FwaFwa time. I forget how many new songs the main characters sung but they were all great and pretty catchy. The song used in the final episode is one of the best songs in the show. It's sad and happy at the same time if you read the translated lyrics of the song. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: (9/10)\\n\r\nThe characters are even more cuter than the last one xD! In the first season, there was no room for character development due to lack of episodes but this time, we got one and it explains all the characters, their personality, likes and dislikes, etc. I already stated my opinions on 4 main characters in my last review and I'm not going to list my opinions again because this is just a new season, not a new show. All of the characters from the first season are here. Characters like Ui, Sawako, Nodoka and Jun didn't get a lot of screen-time in the first season. In this season, they got a lot of screentime and some episode dedicated to them. The 5 main characters of the show are Yui, Mio, Ritsu, Tsumugi and Asuza. I'm only going to introduce Azusa. Azusa is a 17 year old teenage girl and the new 5th main character introduced in the 2nd half of the first season. She plays guitar and is nicknamed Azu-nyan! by Yui.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (9.5/10)\\n\r\nI definitely enjoyed the season season more than the first season because there are more episodes, better music, and jokes are more funnier than the first season. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: (9.1/10)\\n\r\nOverall, the anime is fun to watch. It's a relaxing anime to watch and this is one of those animes that does not have a serious story. Just like the first season, it's the same thing but way better. The amount of fanservice compared to the first season is pretty much the same. There's not a lot, thank god. Like I said in my first review, DO NOT take this anime seriously. If you do, you need to get checked immediately. I'm going to give the same advice to the people who is not a fan of slice of life or moe or whatever you weaboos wanna call it. \\n\r\nIf you're not a fan of slice of life, don't bother wasting your time watching this anime because the opinions you will give on this show are irrelevant and you'll just hate it because you're not a fan of \"slice of life\" genre\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n-Simple and cute story\\n\r\n-Animation is a lot better\\n\r\n-Masterpiece Soundtrack\\n\r\n-Great characters\\n\r\n-Great character development\\n\r\n-Funny moments are better\\n\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-",

            "content": "I don't usually write reviews, as this will be my first one off the bat. I hope not to expose too much about the anime, as it would be a spoiler for those who would like to read the reviews before viewing the anime. I thought I should write one, since this is one of my favourites. Here we go.. enjoy :)\r\nStory: To shorten and sum things up, K-On is about four lovely girls who come together to form the, \"Light Music Club.\" They would carry on throughout the episodes with Culture Festivities, as well as composing new songs and performing them on stage. WhatI liked about K-On is that the scenery portrayed throughout the series, such as: the school, the hallways, the classrooms, the auditorium, were depicted from the actual Sakuragaoka High School\u200e in Japan. This gave it a more realistic feeling towards the anime. Someday I wish I hope to visit that school one day to see the K-On displays held within that school   . .  T.T\\n\\n\r\nArt: Not much to criticize about their artwork, as it was flawless. The characters were created perfectly, as in my opinion, no one looked deformed, their bodies did not look unproportional to their heads as well as the scenery of their depiction from the real Sakuragaoka High School\u200e was very accurate. I would like to give KyoAnimation a two-thumbs up to their Artwork. Well Done.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Noting that this anime was based on music, I thought I'd give it a try and the end result...... AMAZING. Trying a new genre of anime once in a while is not bad at all, and since I gave this a try, I loved it. The music composed throughout the episodes was conducted beautifully, as well as the voice-acting was spot on. Each character had a very unique tone of voice, which I found very interesting, and the sound of instruments and the vocals going off is just too beautiful to put into words throughout this anime. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters throughout this anime are lovable and very \"moe\" in each and every way. Let's start off by naming and describing each of my favorite girls: (Yui Hirasawa / Ritsu Tainaka / Tsumugi Kotobuki / Mio Akiyama / Azusa Nakano)\\n\\n\r\nYui Hirasawa: Yui :3 .. she can be an airhead sometimes, but that's makes us love her even more. Her behaviour may be compared to a childish person, but she is a very caring and sweet person overall. To add on another note, Yui is a very dedicated person. When she sets her mind on something, she puts her 200% effort into it into making the best out of it. Plus, she also adores cute things and loves to eat sweets. She is one of the lead vocalists and guitarists in the band. Also, her laziness side is very cute as she loves to sleep and roll around in her room in the summer times ^-^.\\n\\n\r\nRitsu Tainaka: what more can I say about Ritsu? With her short brown hair with a headband, she can be described as the tomboyish character out of the pack, as well as the president of the Light Music Club. She was the person along with Mio who came up with the Light Music Club in the beginning. As the main drummer in the band, Ritsu is very outgoing and loves to tease Mio by scaring her alot, which I found very funny although it's mean xD. She also likes to eat sweets alongside with Yui as well.\\n\\n\r\nTsumugi Kotobuki: mugi-chan.. our beloved blonde haired mistress. Her friends call her \"Mugi\", and \"Daikon-Brows\" (Japanese Radish)  . She is known to be a wealthy person throughout the anime, as well as the lead pianist in the band. Throughout most of the episodes, Mugi-Chan is the one who provides and serves the tasty treats and tea with her fine expensive china. She seems to be a very humble person who also is subconscious about her weight.\\n\\n\r\nMio Akiyami: Mio Mio Mio. . . She may be the tallest girl in the group. Mio can be described as a very shy person, who is also the lead bassist in the band. She plays the bass left-handed and is one of the main vocalists. She is Ritsu's childhood friend, as they literally grew up together, as they would do homework together and whatnot. Also, she has a fear of disturbing topics such as blood, ghosts, haunted houses and other eerie stuff. She doesn't like to be in the spotlight much, but is usually forced to be in it most of the time throughout the episodes. She is also subconscious about her weight as well\\n\\n\r\nAzusa Nakano: referred to as \"Azu-Nyan,\" by her friends, Azusa is also one of the Lead Guitarists in the band. Azu-Nyan is a year younger than the rest in the band, as well as the last one to join the Light Music Club as she found an interest in it. Despite her very cute personality, she is very talented with her guitar skills as she helped teach Yui with the tabs and what not. She gets shy and embarassed just like mio, which makes it very cute as well. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: In my opinion of watching a Slice of Life, this is the best anime suited for that category, as I enjoyed every minute of what the episodes have to offer. From the funny moments to the sad moments made me recall the nostalgic moments that I had once back when I was a High Schooler. I'm not sure which target audience I'm targeting my review at (high schoolers or post-secondary graduates), but if there are high school graduates reading this review, I'm pretty sure that after they watch the whole series, they will feel the nostalgia hitting them back in the head, making them recall the best moments they had back in high school with their buds, seeing them every and doing all the crazy stuff together, making precious memories out of that you will carry on for the rest of your life.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give this anime a 10/10. One of the best Slice of Life anime's I've ever seen. What more can I say? Four lovely girls who come together to form a band called, \"Light Music Club,\" who make wonderful music together. To whomever is reading this who has not watched the anime, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU WATCH IT. (emphasis with caps hehehe.)  : )\\n\\n\r\nPeace out for now, who knows I might write another review for another favourite that I really enjoyed.

            "content": "The Hogako Tea Time band cannot get anymore funnier! K-on!! is one of the best Moe anime shows I've seen. In every episode of K-on!!, I can never stop laughing at what they do. From Mio's scardiness to Yui's random moments, I always get a LOL. The characters are made so well. Yui's seems to be retarded, but I still love her character. Mio is the only one that is mature in the group (besides Tsumugi), but she along sides has her moments of funny too. Ritsu is just like Yui, only a little bit more mature. Still, she gives off a reason to laughat the show. Tsumugi is rich  bringing in all these fancy stuff to the music room that makes me feel jealous when watching her. And Asuza is a perfect addition to HTT having another mature character supporting Mio. All the supporting characters are awesome in K-on!, especially Sawako-sensai XD.\\n\\n\r\nOverall in this new season, I'm greatly appreciated. The episodes of this new season of K-on! is just as funny as the first season and that's what makes this show awesome! Can't wait to see how this ends! On to Bokudan, HTT!!!",

            "content": "K-On!!  Perhaps one of the best and underappreciated feel good anime titles of all time. \r\nNow, K-ON to shorten things a bit, follows the lives of 4 later 5 ridiculous adorable high school girls as they attend their light music club or \"Keion!\" and get involved in silly shenanigans. Plot for each episode is sort of... I mean, occasionally their is a main plot for certain episodes however for the most part the shows plot and story is completely at random. Now personally  I loved the story, I believe that it's a perfect all rounder show in the five key elements.  Ithas a lots of things Emotional, fun, exciting, cute especially cute, it really has everything a slice of life anime needs. Unlike Kyoto animations Hibike Euphonium, Drama isn't brought up too much in K-On!! because the \"plot\" tends to focus more on the light music club's daily lives. \\n\\n\r\nThe artistic styling of K-ON is sloppy at times however, characters, objects, and background settings maintain vibrant, life, and detail. Character designs aren't the best in terms of limbs. Legs, fingers, and arms it appears as if the animators didn't care about other parts of the girls bodies as long as their face was in the shot. The design on the instruments are beautiful. I appreciated the great length in detail that the animators went into making the instruments.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is pretty interesting. The background music for the show is \"meh.\" It's not defining and just sounds bland. But! when After noon tea time gets on the mic I find myself tapping along to their music. Lastly the voice actors. Perhaps some of the best acting for a music series I've heard at the time I initially watched this. What I loved most though was how cute the girls sounded!\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are amazing. I personally believe that anyone who watched K-On has a favorite(s) It is, with very little doubt, impossible to hate or dislike any of the girls on the show, side characters included. K-Ons cast of characters are well beyond that of the standard moe. In fact, I would need to come up with an entirely new word to describe how adorable these girls are. Now, each character has their own unique personality which is one of the many things I liked about the characters in K-ON. \\n\\n\r\nTheir personalities often times interfere with each other. What makes this so unique is that from real world experience of course, we more times than not, meet people with different personalities and often times don't see eye to eye. However, it is only after we get to know that person and understand them we can work something out and help support one another. The characters support to their fellow club members brings joy to anyone able to tolerate it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall enjoyment for the K-On series will always be strong. If I ever have time to pick it up again then I would be completely engaged in the music and characters as opposed to the story. I feel that K-On is one of the best and underappreciated feel good anime titles of all time. Overall I gave K-On!! a 9/10 for being such a well put together title.",

            "content": "================================\r\nThis review is for both the first and season seasons.\r\n================================\r\nK-On! is one of those shows that other people seem to not understand\r\nIt's more than just cute girls doing cute things - also defined as moe.\r\nI had started this series out, thinking it would be a generic moe show. But i was wrong and what didn't really appeal to me at first became one of my favorite anime shows of all time.\r\nPeople seem to miss the appeal of the show as they think that 1 episode explains the whole series. It doesn't.\r\nStory - 8\r\nThe story consists of Yui the main protagonist joining the light music club,along with 3 other girls and 1 that joins up later. Other than that there are other things worth noting but are spoilers.\\n\r\nThe plot itself isn't really special but it provides a realistic and relatable experience.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10\\n\r\nHere's where most of the praise should be given. The amount of detail put into each and every scene is insane. Kyoto Animation is just about my favorite studio of all time. Taking the worthless and boring source material of K-On! and turning into a masterpiece with beautiful animation and art.\\n\r\nThe animation for the performances are spot on as well.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10\\n\r\nSpeaking of performances, the music in K-On! is amazing (my favorite song being the ED from the movie). They are all performed by the voice actors and sound like how they would in reality, matching the characters' skill levels.\\n\r\nJust about every song is original and splendid.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10\\n\r\nGetting the characters right is crucial in any show, this is no exception. However when it is done wrong, it effects the overall quality of the show.\\n\r\nK-On! manages to have great character development and world building. The characters actual have depth unlike other moe shows where the whole point of them being there is to appeal with their looks and cuteness.\\n\r\nEach and every character has great depth and by the end of the show you start to feel as though you understand each and everyone of them really well.\\n\r\nBy the end of the show, i felt relatively emotional after getting so close to the characters, and it shows even more when i first saw the movie.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\r\nThe writing and jokes are relatively funny, even if some jokes are what you would expect. The art, animation and voice acting combined makes for a very fun and enjoyable experience. You will want to keep coming back for more.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10\\n\r\nK-On! is - in my opinion - a masterpiece. It is very worth watching and hopefully you will enjoy it as much as i do.",

            "content": "K-On+movie review\r\nA story about spending your high school years can be told in many ways like using metaphors or philosophy or from a critique point of view or a lesson about life  but K-ON doesn\u2019t need that stuff to convey the message to his viewer. \r\nK-on uses the most simple and silly things friends do daily to tell a nice , fun and beautiful story about friendship  , bonds , identity and making memories in our high school years with the help of our characters . Our characters are 5 normal high school girls who decide to form a music band and spendtheir 3 years of high school performing together in their Light Music club room.\\n\\n\r\nOn the surface the action of drinking and eating cake each day in the club room for the viewer may seem plain but K-on manages to use the natural atmosphere from the club room to tell us more about the characters. From their silly actions and daily routine we get to know their  habits ,personalities and emotions each character portrays along the development of the story.\\n\\n\r\nK-On takes a reality approach and presents the sister relationship between Yui and Ui . It shows their daily life and the contrast between those two Yui the airhead and clumsy old sister and Ui the responsible and mature little sister that helps Yui. All is done from a natural and reality point of view for the viewer. In the end it\u2019s a simple and beautiful story about two sister who care for each other.\\n\\n\r\nK-on is an anime that  cherishes the bonds between friends and the memories that define their bond.It\u2019s done with the help of our two main characters Mio and Ritsu.We are presented their childhood memories and silly stuff they done , the moments where they laugh and cry together , standing for each other in need until the present day. \\n\\n\r\nK-on portrays  aspects from the Japanese society precisely   the customs between high school students in Japan. Taking a natural and realistic pace of story telling it shows us an insight of how Japanese students spend their 3 years of high school facing the difficulties such as exams but also the enjoyment such as school festivals , clubroom activities , school trip and practice campus. All for the sake of forming bonds and memories with friends. \\n\\n\r\nIn Japan there is common respect for the elder  and K-on manages to portray that with the actions of our characters .Let\u2019s take an example the gratitude letters Azusa write for her Senpai from the music band, the graduation ceremony were the students hand over to their homeroom teacher a notebook with their respect and gratitude message for teaching them all those 3 years.\\n\\n\r\nK-on has a variety of unique and vivid characters that stand out at first glance. Each character plays a different instrument symbolizing their identity and personality. They act so natural in each situation they face that the viewer can relate to them in real life.Yui the airhead and clumsy member but also hardworking, Mio the shy and responsible student, Ritsu the one who acts before thinking , Mugi the elegant and refined lady and finally Azusa the younger member who is the one which everyone can rely on her .\\n\r\nK-on also gives importance to the minor characters who define the characterization of the main 5 girls. Sawa -sensei the popular type teacher who has a wild past, Ui who is the support and little sister for Yui and her friends who always give a hand when in need.\\n\\n\r\nK-on didn\u2019t tried to leave  a empty impression for the viewer and desire for more , so with the help of the movie it managed to portray the next step for the music band which is to perform on a live stage. It was a new experience but also a enjoyable one for the 5 girls in their graduation trip to London. As for the conclusion the movie symbolized a message of gratitude for Azusa who was the support and foundation for the music band in the form of a song. The song relayed the emotions, memories and gratitude from her Senpai across those 2 years that they spend together.\\n\\n\r\nA beautiful and simple slice of life anime with a lot of dumb and silly stuff that happen between our main characters but with a strong and realistic approach on the daily routine and personal lives . A story about the meaning of friendship, bonds and memories , a story about respect and gratitude , a story called K-on. \\n",

Well it was boring, as stated in my review of season 1 the Plot went nowhere and the Characters were so bland and didnt have anything for the viewer to atleast feel attached to them to make the viewer care for what happens to them.\r\nSo i only came to see the first episode so see if they have understood how belowpar season one was! and have they? well.... sort of.\r\nI was in shock because i saw some \"CharacterDevelopment\" for the first time in K On, and that was Yui who still clumsy came in early (mistake from alarm clock) but seems to have improved on the guitar and seem maturing because of it, they now are in the last year i believe and from the first episode they find out they enjoy the club too much and don't want \"Others\" joining they will find new members before the end so Azusa won't be alone (as she is younger)\\n\\n\r\nSo its improved \"Slightly\" but im still hoping this won't be another season in which all that happens is they play in another concert!!!!!!!!!\\n\\n\r\nI have a little bit of hope but i have to saw its a bit better than season 1",

            "content": "You might think I may be biased on K-ON because of the perfect 10, but I would like to explain It a bit further why I gave It a perfect 10. Following up from my Review of the First Season, I did mention that they spend more time on Tea Time rather than practicing, which is still a common thing here on K-ON. I always thought the whole series would be all about Music, but turns out to be the average life of High School girls. Not that I hate It or anything, but I would have liked to see the series adapt to moremusic time because that is what K-ON was advertised or known for which is \"MUSIC\". \\n\\n\r\nHowever, I did change my views on K-ON when I began with Season 2. I felt that Season 2 was better to enjoy because of the longer Episodes. I also find them to be enjoyable even without practice or music time. On top of that, Yui, Mugi, Ritsu, and Mio are all Seniors, they will be graduating while Azunyan will be stayed back, while the girls are off to College. It tells me that this Series seems to be more focused on friendship and High School life than Music, which isn't necessary a bad thing. If you were expecting tons of Music in this Anime, I'm sorry, but you will be disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nStory [10/10]\\n\r\nK-ON! (both Seasons) do not follow a sequential plot like certain Animes do. Heck, you go right ahead and watch Season 2 WITHOUT Season 1 because there is nothing major that happens in the first Season. Unless you want to sit through 12 Episodes of Yui getting started on learning the Guitar as well as getting the Light Music Club together. But the choice is up to you, not mine. What Season 2 seems to be aiming for is graduation since the \"Senpais\" are Seniors now. That's pretty much sums up of what your going to expect in Season 2.\\n\\n\r\nArt [10/10]\\n\r\nI was very impressed on how well the characters are designed as well as the environments. In my opinion, I found that Season 2 felt a lot smoother in terms of animations. I was disappointed by the last Episode of Season 1 because of the bad frame rates of their concert. I'm glad to see KyoAni improving the animations in this Season. Very impressed on how well everything is synchronized from vocals to the instruments.  \\n\\n\r\nSound [10/10]\\n\r\nI loved all the Music in K-ON, they were all easy to listen to and has that \"Happy\" feeling to It, which makes me like It even further. However, this may vary by your taste of music so I can't really judge If the music is good or not since Its entirely your opinion. I guess If you like music with a full band, I'm sure your going to like It.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter [10/10]\\n\r\nAll Characters are perfectly well done, nothing much to complain here. I find them amusing at times and overall seeing them having a good time together.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, K-ON is one of the most nicest Anime I've ever watched so far (followed by Clannad). Mainly because of graduation, which I'm sure 100% of us will or have faced in life. I'll be honest here, I was crying towards the end because I didn't want to see them all go, I was completely attached to these characters. Like I said above, K-ON seems to be aimed towards Friendship & High School life rather than music.",

            "content": "I can talk forever about K-on.  It's a series that sticks with you, well at least for me.  It's a bit moe, but this moe because the center of comedy in this anime.  Just like my K-on! review, this just begins wtih everyone being in their last year as high school students rather than just entering high school.  Watch a few episodes of season 1, if you find it funny, you'll LOVE the series.  If it's okay, keep watching and see if its good.  If it's just for you :(, then stop.\r\nRegardless of what episode has in store, thecharacters brightens up the screen to make me laugh.  I wouldn't exactly know if you would personally find it funny, however if you liked season 1, then you'll LOVE season 2.  If you particularly didn't find K-on funny at all, don't bother with it :).  It's not your type of anime.\\n\\n\r\nI only saw 14 episodes of this season.  14th a few days ago, and the characters personality always put a smile on my face.  No matter what comes around, you'll find yourself amused over something really small.\\n\\n\r\nIe: \u9055\u3046\u3088!\u3000\u30b1\u30fc\u30ad\u306e\u30a4\u30c1\u30b4\u306f\u30b1\u30fc\u30ad\u306e\u9802\u4e0a\u3060\u3088!\u3000\u30cf\u30fc\u30c8\u3060\u3088!\u3000\u9b42\u3060\u3088!  says chigauyo! keeki no ichigo ha keeki no choujou dayo! haato dayo! tameshi da yo!  which means That's not it!  The cake's strawberry is the cake's summit!  It's the heart! It's the soul!  The way Yui says that in episode 14, I found that just hilarious!  I mean, I wouldn't want someone stealing my strawberry either, but just the fact she made a big deal out of it (in a friendly way).  Then later in the episode, Yui shows that Mio was crying that her strawberry was taken lol.  The characters turn something simple as that into a pure innocent comedy.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and IN and ED are always just perfect.  No thank you, and Utauyo Miracle are just perfect songs, showing just how good this series is.  I hope the voice for Yui and Mio get into other music animes :)",

I do this review to express your own opinion about this anime.\r\nStory: Following the success of K-On - SS1, SS2 is the story of three high school last year's light music club - aka Houkago Tea Time HTT, the anime is \"more tea after school\" Hirasawa Yui include, Tainaka Ritsu , Mio Akiyama, Kotobuki tsumugi and 5th member school year 2, Azusa Nakano. Unlike SS1 only13 ep but mention the 2 years of HTT, ss2 ep 26 describes very carefully the activities that the group HTT did last year, and especially feelings of each member knowing this is the last year they were playing music together under the roof of school.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Type the characters well drawn as this action is quite cute and novelty (apparently also has art animation channel A as K-on), especially the details Sawa-chan, Yui, Ritsu cycle when not mine quite pleasant is kawaii.\\n\r\nThe movement according to his guitar playing Yui see something a little far-fetched, but also did not affect the art of anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 1 anime about music, so this is definitely the best Kyoani have cared. The OP, ED, INS songs, with soothing BGM must have taken it to heart in the K-On fan.\\n\r\nOP and ED 13 respectively first ep \"Go! Go! Maniac\" and \"Listen !!\"\\n\r\nif OP 1 gas can express hurry, vibrant and fast-paced lyrics \"jump, jump, jump up!\" ED is also partly reflected the personality of the group HTT in costume performing quite the personality.\\n\r\nfrom episode 14 onwards is the OP: \"Utauyo !! Miracle\" with ED: \"\" No, Thank You! \". All four songs on them by 5 seiyuu shown. ED as one thanks to the fans affection and have been together 26 ep K-On !!\\n\r\nI was particularly impressed with guitar solos \"Fuwa Fuwa Time\" Azu-nyan end of ep 26.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:Women are still staging char from SS1, just add the character of DeathDevil vacant band.\\n\r\nremains the unmistakable moe not be of Mio, Yui Azu-nyan or ..\\n\r\nthe end of his char as follows: Azu-nyan> Mio = Ui> Yui> mugi> Ritsu.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I'd say I enjoyed this anime very much, it's still enjoyable,1 of the anime club and has a moe fun of it.\\n",

            "content": "K-ON! is an incredibly endearing anime, while it isn't particularly earth shattering, it is probably one of the best of its genre. Its cute moe slice of life setting holds its own and again its a kyo ani show , who bring out the wonder in daily life with its true to life characters and visual depiction.  \r\nStory: The story isn't an amazing display of intricate story telling, but the anime is well paced, each episode has something going on and there aren't really any episodes where you feel like it was a waste of 24 minutes, nor does it become difficult to followbecause of too much going on. Its not varied and has a neat story with hilarious scenarios which play out well ,not to mention how the story molds on into the second season.You will find lotta perspective shots and character driven plot points without any actual glossing.Its light and that is the best praise I  can give it  \\n\\n\r\nStory: 7.4/10\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Kyoto Animation did a great job animating the series. The style is cute and captures the feeling of the series. And all the details, from the instruments to the backgrounds are captured well. Naoko Yamada is truly a master at this with her work in full metal panic and as an ED in Hibike  .Her story telling using shot composition is amazing with some tonal frame shifts provide immense depth ,all in all making for a beautiful experience with a very unique take on moe depiction .\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 9.6/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: K-ON! was very well cast, the seiyuus do a great job capturing the characters. Even the supporting cast is terrific and  The music cute and catchy, which fits the series wonderfully.The opening Cagayake Girls! is just that , with its sharp and quick stills and shaky visuals which mirror the drama in the show.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9.8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters are very endearing and memorable, and you will grow to love them throughout the series.The girls personalities play so well of each other,like any other show of  this genre namely, A-channel or lucky star.More so in this 4-koma manga depiction that has mellow drama in spades with burst of team spirit and hilarious moments.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: K-ON! is funny, cute, and endearing, it does a great job capturing the 4-koma it's based on, and probably exceeds it to some degree. It's not for everyone, but for those of us who love a good slice of life anime, it's certainly well worth watching.I for one love it as it melds over perfectly with its characters and creates an unique take which I love and adore . This is one of the crowning jewels of anime depiction and uses shot composition better than any other show and its not even close . If u like four girls who dick around the whole time then go for it .\\n\r\nI AM A MOE FETISH NECK BEARD <-_->   \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9.6/10\\n\\n\r\nCollapse\\n\r\n7.4/10\\n\r\nstory\\n\r\n 9.6/10\\n\r\nanimation\\n\r\n 9.8/10\\n\r\nsound\\n\r\n 9.5/10\\n\r\ncharacters\\n\r\n 9.6/10\\n\r\nTHANK U",

            "content": "(This is my first review)\r\nLet me just start off with this K-on is a Moe anime aka cute girls doing cute things if you do not like Moe Anime then you will not like K-on.\r\nStory 8/10: Despite what you may have seen or heard music is not the main focus of K-on!! while they do perform they don't do it enough for this to be classified as band anime. K-on is much more focused on what the girls get up to in daily lives. But there is theme of time in K-on!! which hits you every so often that lets you know times is runningout (because they are seniors) until it hits the girls as well. I'm not for crying about anime but during this I cried. This to me sets k-on!! apart from all other Moe anime.\\n\r\nAlthough the last few episodes felt out of place.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8\\10: Nothing out of the ordinary really sometimes the animation can look pretty impressive tho. Fits the anime well.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9\\10: Even tho there are few songs they are all great From Fuwa Fuwa Time to U and I every song is a blast to listen to. Also both the ops and eds are great. The backgrounds are pretty good too I find my humming them sometimes Overall a pretty memorable ost. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10\\10: While some are minor a lot of character development does occur in K-on!! All of the characters they are in the light music club but we do see development in other characters such as Nodoka or Ui. ( Can't say the light music club develop because of spoilers) \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10\\10: Must of K-on!!'s Enjoyment comes comedy which I can safety say for the most part is funny. Basically you have Mio and Azusa who play the straight man. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10: K-on!! isn't just a another Moe anime its a coming of age story with hilarious comedy and a loveable cast of Characters. K-on!! season 2 Is a MUST WATCH.  \\n",

It introduces Ui, Yui's little sister, and Jun, a friend of Ui and Asuza, as a second group of protagonists to follow. Some episodes give an interesting back-to-back where one follows the older girls through a period of time, then you immediately see next episode the same period from the youngers' point of view. \r\nWhile just as aesthetically and musically appealing as the previous season, it seems as though having twice as many episodes doenot mean twice as much plot and the show can seem slow moving at times. However, the pace of the show in general remains good and the character development continues through all episodes. K-On!! almost brought tears on a few times, with you really being able to feel and connect with the emotions and situations of the characters involved.",

But hey, thats not a bad thing right?\r\nK-On has some of the most moe and genuine humor that I have ever seen in an anime. The story is great with it being a journey through the girls, Yui, Mio, Azusa, Tsumugi, and Ritsu, three years in highschool. \r\nThe cast of characters is very diverse, and everyone is special in their own way. You have Yui, who is love with sweets, and especially her guitar, Giita. Mio, who is a Dandere,a ndgets embarrased so easily.  Ritsu who is very outlandish and laid back. Azusa who gets very serious at times, but is easily tempted with sweets. And finally Tsumugi, or just Mugi, who has fun being with every, and bringing in sweets for the whole band to enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nThe music in the show is very high quality. The band in the show, After School Tea Time, makes multiple songs which are very high quality, even so that I sometimes listen to them in my free time.\\n\\n\r\nThere arent many shows that truly make me laugh as much as I did when watching K-On, but for the few that do, it is such an enjoyable experience, just like K-On.",

            "content": "K-On!! was good in its own ways. Compared to season one, it doesn't really bring anything new to the table, so if you didn't enjoy season one, then this season probably isn't for you. \r\nJust like in season one, K-On!! is a laid back slice of life anime focusing on five high school girls and their music club. It's very light-hearted and overall a very peaceful watch. If I were to compare it to another anime, I would say it's somewhat similar to Aria the Animation in that both anime are very slow paced and never really get anywhere in terms of plot. \r\nDon't interpretthat as a negative comment though! I liked Aria a lot and I enjoyed watching this anime as well. The first few minutes of episode one were very inducing and I was immediately interested. Many following episodes were very cute in various ways and usually kept me wanting to watch another episode ( I finished the season in about three days). The later episodes seemed to drag on a bit, in particular episode twenty ( you'll know what I mean if you see it) but I was already so deep into the series I figured I'd finish up. \\n\r\nMy main issue with this anime is really just its focus. The anime is about a music club, so I was really hoping to learn a lot about music and in particular, guitars and how to play them. Sadly, the anime really doesn't have very much to teach. It's focus is more on the 'moe' of these high school girls, for lack of a better term. This disappointed me in season one and it disappointed me again in season two, though the second time I was more or less expecting it. \\n\r\nIf the anime wasn't going to teach me anything, my second hope was that this anime would motivate me to want to put in some effort and learn how to play guitar myself. It's not that unusual for an anime to do that. Prince of Tennis was very successful in making me want to play tennis, and even now I still play quite frequently. Hikaru no Go easily motivated me to want learn how to play Go and get relatively good. Recently I've been slacking, but at my best I was around 4-5 kyu. In the same way as those animes, I was hoping K-On! and K-On!! would motivate me to want to play guitar. Sadly it never does, and the biggest cause of that is the anime's minimal focus on the instruments and the music. Honestly, the club the girls were in really could have been anything at all and the anime would still have worked.\\n\r\nBut despite all that, I still enjoyed what this anime had to offer. No, it wasn't what I was hoping for, but what its got is certainly not bad. I grew to like many of the characters and truly felt touched at certain parts of the anime ( I even teared up on a particularly sad scene). Many scenes were genuinely funny, even for an American like myself who didn't catch many cultural jokes. When they finally got to performing I even felt nervous for them. \\n\r\nAll in all, it was a good show. It was better than season one despite the fact that it really didn't offer very much innovation. If you liked season one, you'll like season two. If you thought season one was meh, then give season two a chance, it might surprise you.\\n\r\nOne more thing I would like to thank this anime for: keeping it clean. K-On!! manages to prove that anime girls can be attractive and charming without the need for any sexual focus, whatsoever. No fan service at all. Not one panty shot, not one close up on breasts. I, as a strong anime fan, am grateful for this, especially since recent anime have shamelessly squeezed in as much sexuality as humanly possible ( looking at HOTD mainly). And would you look at that? If you go to anime doujinshi website, you'll find almost nothing for High school of the Dead, but if you look for K-On!, you'll probably find countless pages! It just goes to show that sometimes less is more, and in this case, none at all is definitely more.",

            "content": "*REVISED REVIEW BECAUSE BACK THEN I WASN'T ANY GOOD IN WRITING AND I'M JUST A LITTLE BIT BETTER NOW*\r\nIf you are sick and in need of a little happiness then this anime is the right medicine for you!\r\nStory: (9/10)\r\nAfter re-watching this, the story is even more better than the first time I watched it. Unlike the first season of K-ON!, K-ON!! involves a little more depth and feelings. Our beloved characters are now in their senior year, and with their club not getting any new members, they either worry for their beloved junior, Azusa, or about their future. This will appeals to more people becausemany of us knows the feeling of not knowing what to do with their future and leaving high school. High School are not called the best years of your lives for nothing you know. It could be the best years of your live, especially for Yui, our main characters, who knows nothing but fun. And leaving all that so soon is hard and saddening. Don't you worry though, it still involves many 'moe-moe' moment and comedy so don't worry!\\n\\n\r\nArt: (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nMoe-moe kyun! Cute and fluffiness are the soul of this art, with the characters all being cute with their fluffiness and small feet and hand. The animation though! Oh! So fluid and beautiful and I feel like I could die from happiness from it!\\n\\n\r\nSound: (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nAs I grow up, I have mature a bit and notice a lot more stuff, especially the background music. K-ON!! has a very noticeable music that doesn't get in the way. It blends in well with the scene and the studio knows how to use it to get our feelings moving.\\n\\n\r\nK-ON!! is a story about a band, so their music are all catchy. If the art is all fluffy, so will their music. Lyrics either being in love or about their dreams and having fun. Their music leaves behind a positive note that makes YOU all fluffy on the inside.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nEach character has many different trope. For example, Yui the airhead one. Mio the shy one and so on. But as they grow up a little and experience different things, you cheer for them and little by little fall in love with them because each of them are very lovable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nNot only it is cute, it comedic, it has good music and it has lovable characters. The story is also relateable so that's a big plus! It is really cute and fluffy so maybe it's a turn off for certain people but if you can get pass that, than I'm sure it will be rewarding for you!",

            "content": "Yes, it's moe, maybe it's not your cup of tea (no pun intended) but while this series doesn't knock a lot of other series out of the park, it's certainly a good carry-over series if you're waiting on another title to come out.\r\nThe only way I've been able to describe K-ON! is a little Azumanga with musicians (like Beck).  I enjoyed the first season a good amount but I wasn't itching in my pants for season two at first.  I didn't like how the characters didn't seem to original or fleshed out, some had personality quirks I couldn't get over and never gotreally explained.  I didn't know what to expect from season 2 but more of the same.\\n\\n\r\nK-ON!! or the second season actually does a great job in working out those personality and interaction issues I had with season 1.  Each character has a more likable personality, yet unique in their own rite.  The characters all seem to \"progress,\" or grow up if you will in the second season in terms of how they're portrayed, but they don't lose the fundamental of what makes them who they are.  It's very refreshing and in my opinion makes the second season much more enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nNot everyone will like K-ON! though; a colleague had explained it well to me: it's enjoyable if you spend time with friends.  Those that don't have friends or don't really hang out with friends generally seem to lack the same enjoyment nor are able to connect with the characters in the series.  To each their own I guess.\\n\\n\r\nThe new music introduced in the second season involves more than \"Fuwa Fuwa Time\" thankfully.",

Eating cake, playing music, go to the beach. There's not much shit happening in each episode in fact there's nothing happen at all. Yui and her idiocy keeps irritating me to no end. Azusa my waifu dear, you just great as you are.\r\nK-On!! I say it louder this time. Season 2 pretty much the same with season 1, a total waste of your time. What worse K-On!! has 26 episodes, so prepare your pillow.\r\nStory: 5\r\nI'd be lying if Isaid there was plot in K-On.

            "content": "for a long time i had always wanted to watch k-on. it had a fairly decent score, and a lot of people had been talking about it. but what made me try to keep avoiding it was the whole cute girls playing instruments theme. i've never been too keen on 'moe', and when i did ever watch things which rely on it i feel like i had let my self down in letting my self watch these shows which are usually full on fan service. but what made k-on different to other anime which rely on 'moe' was that it was innocent. it was simple,and it was surprisingly enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nK-on is mostly a light, slice of life anime. although its supposed to be about a band which creates music. most of the episodes don't even have them practicing or doing anything to do with music. If anything, K-on's story is very basic. its about 4 school girls who decide to revive the dying light music club by joining it. once the club is officially formed, they form a band, and spend their days after school in the club room, where they spend most of their time eating snacks, and drinking tea. the anime doesn't really have a continuous storyline, and most of the events are just random things happening in school. the story has not really changed from the first season and keeps this formula. but what makes the second season's more enjoyable than the first season is the fact that its the girl's final year, and you start to feel that they are just girls that are enjoying them selves for one more year before separating, and leaving azusa to take care of the light music club. with 26 episodes in the second season, events in the final year are more packed, and not so spread out, and maybe not so rushed to a degree like in the first season.\\n\\n\r\nthe art in k-on is very nice, and appealing. the character designs are very cute, and pretty, and everything is very colourful. the backgrounds are detailed in general, and its fairly easy on the eye in general. the animation seems to have also gotten better from the first season too. its more smooth, and fluid, and small details like hair, and finger movements are taken into account which shows that the producers did put quite a lot of effort into the animation. this is especially shown when they are playing the instruments, and performing gigs. \\n\\n\r\ni believe that in the second season the characters have been given more depth. there not just girls who do cute things, and unnaturally act cute and innocent. they have strayed away from the 'cute' fanservice like mio constantly crying, and azusa being forced to wear cat ears, and meowing a little more in this season, and act a lot more naturally. there personalities are shown more, and you start to see that they are just normal girls, with some little quirky traits which you would find in most anime. with it being their last school year, you see that they start acting a little more mature and that they appreciated their school lives, accepting the fact that they have to grow up.\\n\\n\r\nwith the anime about 'music'...well to a degree, the soundtrack has to be decent, which i believe they have done a good job with in my opinion. the opening and ending themes are catchy, and suit the theme of the anime. i'm personally not into the sort of pop-rock genre but the songs are catchy and enjoyable (in my opinion) anyway. the background music in k-on is also good. the songs used fit the theme of the scenes, whether it is sad, happy, or just random..which is what the anime mostly is. the background music overall is catchy and isn't noticed so much that it will get on your nerves.\\n\\n\r\ni enjoyed k-on a lot. what made me enjoy this one a lot than the last season, was how it was the girl's final year in school, and you sort of treasure their days which are numbered in the school. i personally think that since i graduated from high school about 3 months ago, it made the series more enjoyable. it made me think, despite how much i complained about school, i did enjoy it..to a degree anyway and how i should appreciate how fun a school life can be. (i sound like an old man now..although i kind of act like one anyway).\\n\\n\r\nanyway, i hope you found the review helpful. this is the first review i have actually put some effort in (don't bother reading my others, i've had poo's that could probably write better ones). its not the best, but i just had the urge to write a review on this particular anime. \\n\\n\r\nthanks for reading my review anyway..if you did finish it anyway haha.",

            "content": "It took me a while to finish this season, I didn't want it to end.  Like so much in life,  it seems there's never enough time.  I'm not going to go too much into the characters and story because it's a continuation of the first season.  I do like the use of colors in this one better than the first season.  The use of twilight and night are absolutely spot on.  Though I have continue to enjoy other high school slice of life, like Azumanga Daioh and Lucky Star, none have captures the friendship, comradery and love that actuallydevelops between people in high school clubs and sports.  As i peruse the reviews I check the profiles of the reviews I like.  I see what other manga and anime you liked.  I do look at the ages, if they are listed.  Many are of my age, but many are younger.  I have been out of high school almost longer than some of the members have been alive.  I fear the poignancy is lost on the younger generation.  This is by no means a how to guide for high school, because in my high school career I lost two good friends in accidents.  Nothing will make you sicker than seeing an empty chair with a picture of a friend sitting on it.  I try to stay off my soap box on these reviews, but I wan to jump on it just for a moment.\\n\\n\r\nTo those about to graduate and those entering high school; the friends you make and the time you spend there will define you for the rest of your life.  They will help you grow, show you your potential, and take you down a notch when you get a little full of yourself.  Your only regret from high school should be the time was to short. The teachers my yell, the alarm go off too early, but the time spent ate that school will be remembered for the rest of your life.  If anything is taken from K-ON!! it should be that time spent with friends is time not wasted, even if you're just wasting time.  \\n\\n\r\nI had to take a leadership class for my volunteer fire department when I became an officer.  The instructor was nearly killed in an accident while on the job.  He told us the most important thing you could do is tell those under you (the under classman) that you care about them.  He said, \"Never let a friend leave before telling them you love them, because you may never see them again.\"\\n\\n\r\nI'll get off my soap box now.  As i stated in my K-on! review this has become a favorite of mine.  The second season made me pull out my senior year book and remember the time I spent, before twilight fell on my youth and dawn broke on the first day of my new life.",

            "content": "Normally  i would avoid watching shows of this nature, but K-on is an exception to how i view shows like this. K-on on the surface looks like a generic cute girls shows with lots   events that don't matter. However in a sense it is very close to being a masterpiece. This primarily because Naoko Yamada and the team at Kyoto animation elevated it higher than its source material.\r\n        Story:8/10\r\nK-on story is about how people become better and function better with friends and the way it executes the premise is honestly flawless in a myraid ofways. The show gets better with every step of the way . The buildup of the scenes are incredible especially toward the end of this series when the band makes the song which is the emotional climax. Most of the episodes are lighthearted like any other show but the events that are portrayed are more significant than others. Some criticize K-on as uneventful, however i feel like people don't  open their minds enough to understand the show a little better. It would also allow more people to see K-on as not just any ordinary show of its genre   . I do agree the show at certain episodes can get boring with beach episodes,but overall the episodes are very good at communicating the main point of the show.\\n\r\nArt:9/10\\n\r\nThe art is unquestionably beautiful. the gradients work well with the designs of the characters and the two tone shading also is well done. The artwork of the background is actually detailed and beautiful which is typical of Kyoto animation\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10-The timing of the use of sounds is brilliant and well thought out. The voice actor are great at certain the sense of cohesion with the jokes that occur in K-on .\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9/10:- Lovable and relatable especially Azusa 's situation with her friends. The character have great chemistry with their jokes and the groups relationship continuing  to build which makes you invested in the characters. The characterization is less obvious than other animes\\n\r\n Naoko Yamada uses the camera  to focus on  the girls legs by showing how they  move in comparison to the first season to tell us the change in personality and how the groups friendship has changed the characters.\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10",

            "content": "The principal weakness of series 1 is plot, or rather, the greater focus on situational comedy or drama than a longer story arc. We got to see funny moments in friendship, and whatever conflict there was usually resolved with a solid bonk to Ritsu's head (even if she wasn't the perpetrator). There were maybe a couple of tearful moments, but they were more of an \"awww\" moment for me rather than anything tear-jerking. Series 1 was first and foremost a comedy that took its time, punctuated by beautifully-animated and recorded musical performances. Now, that didn't float everyone's boat, but I was totally fine with it,I thought it was a solid production with good visuals and hilarious comedy.\\n\\n\r\nSeries 2 takes Series 1 and gives it an expansion and makeover, turning a sitcom into a slice-of-life comedy/drama with an actual timeline, as opposed to moments in the lives of four or five high school band members. It's still a comedy taking its time telling the stories of five girls who mostly enjoy tea together, but it's so much more in series 2. In order for it to succeed as a (melo)drama, K-On!! needed to convince the audience that while the show must come to an end like all good things, no one wants the show to end-- it must tell a story about seishun and maximize the longing for it without waxing nostalgic. By putting the audience firmly in Azusa's shoes as she watches her bandmates graduate, I'd say the show handily exceeded expectations. It's such a tear-jerker at the end, in fact, that the actresses had to fight hard (especially Mio's) to not cry during the fan concert after the broadcast. I'm sure the chemistry among the voice actresses is one big reason why the on-screen performance was so convincing-- when Yoko lost her place in a song during the concert, Aki was right there to get her back on track.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the base work is a 4-panel comic strip! The amount of content preparation and expansion KyoAni did surely dwarfed series 1.\\n\\n\r\nKyoAni still started from the solid foundation of Kakifly's original comic, which in the latter volumes also evolved to include the girls in longer stories, like the field trip in Kyoto that featured some really funny jokes involving Sawa-chan. Some episodes didn't quite click with me (the flow of the \"it was all a dream\" episode tended to be all over the place for my tastes), but the progression from five girls mostly having tea to saying farewell at the end was well written and executed. Yui's growth from airheaded dojikko in particular is a joy to watch.\\n\\n\r\nAs in series 1, it's not all about the music, but when there's a performance, it's something special. The repertoire of Hokago Tea Time expands by at least 10 songs in series 2, including: a rock version of the high school anthem, a song that features Mio prominently, another that features Mugi (finally! Mugi's charming voice in something other than a character song), two songs written by Yui, and one very special song reserved for the end of the story. I'd imagine this time around, everyone was crying with Azusa. Not all of these songs are performed in the show, but are available on the official CDs.\\n\\n\r\nGo! Go! Maniac is a nice, upbeat opening theme, but in my opinion the second opener, Utauyo!! Miracle is a stronger song and has better visuals because they look like high school girls filmed a music video; both songs require Aki-chan to sing almost nonstop, and always professional, she nailed both in the live concert. It's the reverse for the ending songs: though both have their charm, I prefer the one for the first half over the second mainly because the visuals are more \"fun\".\\n\\n\r\nLittle tributes are sprinkled throughout the show, such as scenes depicting how the band created those \"photographs\" that are the DVD covers for series 1. After the climax in episode 24, two additional episodes were broadcast, as though the production crew also just couldn't say goodbye... and then they announced the film after (I think) the OVA. I bet 2chan melted down at that point. I loved how the final scene mirrors the closing moments of the manga before the split into \"university\" and \"junior\" versions, passing the torch to the next generation of the Light Music Club. If you love the series and can get your hands on the concert DVD, do eet-- Madoka Yonezawa (Ui) and Chika Fujito (Nodoka) nail their performances as well, and the Death Devil part is hilarious.\\n\\n\r\nNo one wanted it to end, but like all good things, the series came to a close. Clearly the production staff didn't want it to leave it there, so they did what every other production crew would do in that situation and made a feature film. Oh, yes, this is gonna be good.",

            "content": "The following review is entitled \"Dr. Moeblob or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Slice of Life\"\r\nThis is a plea to every anime fan out there. I do not care what genres you watch. I do not care if you are male or female. I do not care if you hate moe with a passion. GIVE THIS SHOW A CHANCE! Hopefully throughout the course of this you will feel compelled to watch at least one episode of K-ON! if you have not already. With that out of the way, onto the actual review. This will be a review for both seasons of K-ON!I only have the first season rated a 9 instead of a 10 because my favorite character does not show up until the latter half. Anybody who knows me will know that I love K-ON! All of my anime loving friends look at me in disgust when I say it's one of my favorite shows of all time. (2nd favorite to be exact) What could some \"moeblob\" show do to warrant a 10/10 rating? Well, it is tough to explain, but I would like to try. One might look at the 10 rating I have given this show and say that rating should be reserved for deep, thought-provoking shows like Neon Genesis Evangelion. While I agree this is true, (EoE is and forever will be my favorite movie of all time) I would also contend that sometimes less is more. K-ON! is virtually plotless, it is simply snippets of the main character's everyday lives, like many other Slice of Life shows. Some might say that not having a plot is a bad thing, but I would say the opposite. K-ON! is a true masterpiece because it does what few other shows can do: it thrives on strongly written characters and their interactions. While K-ON! is a show most would watch with their brain turned off, it still has spectacular writing. The characters bounce off each other, and have a great chemistry that makes the show a joy to watch. K-ON! makes boring everyday activities extremely fun to watch because of good writing alone. I believe that makes this show worthy of being called a masterpiece. On top of that, the soundtrack is outstanding. I still find myself listening to songs from the show almost daily. The animation is also top notch. Initially, I did not like the animation. However, as I kept watching, I noticed the remarkable attention to detail Kyoani weaved throughout the show. From how the hair flows to how fluid the characters movements were, I found myself more and more impressed by the animation as the show went on. Last but not least, K-ON! is a show with an extremely high enjoyment factor. I have never watched a series that was as fun as K-ON! was. The humor in the show is amazing, and there are tons of memorable moments. All in all, K-ON! is not a show you should write off for being moe. K-ON! is truly a masterpiece; it is an embodiment of the human spirit. It shows that sometimes, less can truly be more.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: I do not care who you are. Whether you normally watch action shows or are a veteran of the SoL genre, K-ON! is a show that is worthy of your time. Even if you hate \"moeblob\" shows, give it a try, it just might be your new favorite guilty pleasure.",

It's plot is pretty nonexistent but the music and character development are some of the best in the anime world. \r\nIf you can't fall in love with one of the five girls this anime will probably not be very enjoyable.

            "content": "This show is all about girls in high school.  It is mildly humorous, in fact just enough so to keep me watching through both seasons 1 and 2 -- 41 episodes in all.  It is mostly light drama about relationships and funny anecdotes from high school days. The story is entirely about a group of girls and their friends; there are no male characters other than an incidental teacher or shop-keeper throughout the entire series.  There is no romance whatsoever either, and  it has no ecchi or fan service at all.\r\nI liked the characters, but the story was very weak, inthat there are no serious dramatic moments throughout THE ENTIRE 41 EPISODES.  It was almost entirely slice-of-life.  If you want something very light to watch to fall asleep to, this one is not half-bad, but it won't be winning any dramatic achievement awards.  The only thing different about season 2 is the girls are in their last year of high school now, and have added an underclass girl to the band.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, there is an OVA movie, that movie takes place after the end of the second season.  Watch it last.\\n",

            "content": "This is a review for K-On!, K-On!! and the K-On! Movie\r\nNever in my life did I expect myself to enjoy a moe anime - not that I had ever seen one prior to watching K-On! Being a huge Urubutcher fan and just thematically challenging and ambiguous media in general meant that I went into K-On! expecting myself to hate it. I was so wrong...\r\nStory 9/10\r\nHonestly, this one was a bit hard to mark as K-On!'s story revolves around a group of high school girls in a band and their experiences going through high school. But everything was done in an enjoyable manner, the story isa satisfying one and it models the sort of high school life I wish I had (I just graduated last year and I'm already getting sentimental damn..). There were some genuinely touching and heartwarming moments along the way which I seriously appreciated.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation 8/10\\n\\n\r\nK-On!'s art and animation remain consistently solid throughout and occasionally impresses, but otherwise, there wasn't anything particularly jaw-dropping. The art style, however, was most suitable for the genre and for the overall mood of the show with oversimplifications of some body parts as well as frequent comedic sketches. Props to Kyoto animators for doing the correct chording and fretting for guitar/bass, there never was really many shots of the keyboard and I'm pretty horrible at drumming so I can't judge.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\\n\r\nFor many of us, the sound is a huge standout in this series. Some of the best voice acting I've ever witnessed originates from this show. Yui and Ritsu's voice actresses do a particularly good job. And the music. I've been listening to K-On!'s soundtrack for the past 3 weeks now and I'm still not sick of it. I've learned quite a few of these on guitar and piano already just for fun, there are just so many absolute bangers. The 4 EDs all stood out; Mio's singing and the heavier rock tone made the songs less cutesy and gave the sound more edge. I also like the songs Yui voices, especially Fuwa Fuwa Time as well as the two 'tearjerker' numbers: U&I and Tenshi ni fureta yo. Honestly, just some of the best sound you can ask for from an anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAll the characters are simple and lovable, I mean that's the essence of moe right? My fav is Yui because she's like my spirit animal - if only the real world wouldn't condemn those who act in the way she does... But yes, I love how the girls are all so friendly, nice and transparent, the world needs more people like them.\\n\\n\r\nIssues\\n\\n\r\nI have almost no issues with the show whatsoever, there are two I would like to point out though. Firstly, I wish they would play us whole songs or at least the typical 1:30 length for concerts and performances. It feels like we miss out when we don't get the whole concert experience. I much prefer the Your Lie in April approach here where they perform complete works. Secondly, the first season for me was too rushed. They rushed through two years of events four times faster than that of the second season. I get that senior year in high school is the most important and that maybe there wasn't enough source material but it made the experience feel a little incomplete.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is one show that is sure to keep you smiling - provided you aren't a nihilist and that you're open to cute stuff (categories which I thought I fell under so you never know xD ). Finally, a show I enjoy that doesn't include bloodshed and drama!! \\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\\n\r\nBig shout out to my mate Daniel for inspiring me to watch this with his beautiful karaoke rendition of Don't say 'lazy'. \\n\\n",

It's not about crime or anything, but it takes its brand of slice-of-life very seriously and never compromises its vision with anything other than providing a snapshot of these characters' reality. Additionally, artificial weight isn't added to important moments through melodrama, the show is just good enough that the stuff that's supposed to leave an impact does so on its own. I've seen no other anime like it and few other pieces ofmedia like it, period.",

            "content": "Note: the finale is episode 24. Episodes 25 and 26 are \u2018extras\u2019, set during the timeline before episodes 23 and 24. I wanted to point this out to future viewers as I didn\u2019t enjoy the realisation that the show was reaching a conclusion as I was watching and earlier than I expected!\r\nEps 25 and 26 can be viewed chronologically with the rest of the series (after ep 21, before ep 23) but they work well thematically, as a kind of, second ending. \r\nK-On! season 1 covers two years in 13 episodes. Season 2 covers senior year (for Yui, Rin, Mio and Mugi) in 26 episodes.The show uses the increased time to expand its cast and explore its characters, primary and secondary \u2013 this is done with some characters better than others but is mostly successful.\\n\\n\r\nWith the first season, the focus was on the development of the club and goals of the group as a band and as musicians. In the second season the club is still central but the focus shifts slightly to school life. Each episode has a strong focus and consistently delivers humour and the infectious, enthusiastic K-On tone. Only occasionally dragging, the episodes perhaps vary in quality/enjoyment based on activity or character focus. \\n\\n\r\nThe second half of this season takes us through the steps of senior year. The intimidating future of life after high school - separation, growing up - has a gently looming presence over the group of friends, which builds to an affecting conclusion. \\n\\n\r\nK-On detractors may claim the show isn\u2019t really about music. But the reality is that practice is boring and song-writing frustrating, depictions of both are used sparingly. The unpretentious and fierce passion for music felt by the characters and creators is clear and evident through the excellent songs within the show and performed in the opening and closing titles. \\n\\n\r\nSeason 2 builds on the enthusiasm and sweetness of season 1 to deliver more of the same and then some.\\n",

Season 1 was great and Season 2 was also great and episode difference? 13:26\r\nStory:- 8/10.  K-on! Starts from where the girls began their high school life until their graduation, K-on bu or as in Light Music Club was on a brink of disbanation but Rin manages to recruit all 4 main characters and Sawa-Sensei. Azunyan was introduced later on when they are in second year. The story was based on more on their slice of life rather than music though it isall about music but it mainly focuses on Slice of life like having tea breaks instead of practicing, having a training camp at Mugi's vacation house but instead of that, they were having fun, no practice at all yet their performance are outstanding. \\n\\n\r\nArt:- 9/10. What could I say about Kyoto Animation? Their art always been the infamous one, such as Melachony of Haruhi Suzumiya and Lucky Star. Kyoto Animation Art = Best Art design. I wonder how they made such an awesome show.\\n\\n\r\nSound:- Cagayake Girls, Utauyo Mircale! Those two OPs are rocking awesome. I've been listening to it repeatedly. OST such as background musics are quite smoothing and enjoyful.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:- 9/10 From My girls position: 1. Yui Hirasawa 1. Mio Akiyama 2. Azusa Nakano 3. Mugi 4. Rin  Why Yui and Mio? Yui is an air headed girl, I love her, she is a fast learner too like she never learn guitar before when she joined the group, Mio? She hates scary things and I loveee her face reactions! Azusa? She is almost the same level as Mio. Rin and Mugi? Rin is cool and love to tease people while Mugi enjoys making tea to them. Ahh tea \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:- 10/10. KYAA! KAWAII! I embrace my plushie thinking as Yui Hirasawa while watching K-on! It's good to watch if you feel bored. So if you like Moe stuffs, watch this. If you don't want, don't bother coming back. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:- 9/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nWelcome to Light Music Club! ~Nyaa?",

            "content": "It's super cliche, but where do I begin with this show? I'll preface this with this statement, K-On!! is my personal favorite anime ever. I've heard this being called a generic moeblob show, cute girls doing cute things with 0 substance. I'll be honest, I thought this as well, how could this compare to the all time great anime like some people said it did. In this review, I hope to convince you that this is 100% up their with all time great anime.\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nK-On!! is more of an episodic series, this is true. There is only one real \"arc\" in the whole show. Itis really just the girls doing daily stuff. The thing is though, it's not like the episodes are filler, or forgotten, as there is an overarching story with tons of development and growth. I would go into more detail, but I'd be spoiling the fun for you, the story you really have to experience for yourself. It's a ride of emotions the whole way through.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nI feel like people brush off the art/animation of this show as just being cute and write it off as bad. This could not be further from the fact. Yes, K-On!! is  extremely cute looking, but it doesn't use its cuteness as a way to be lazy with its art and animation. There is still plenty of detail and visual gags. My favorite thing to bring up when I talk about the animation is how it is musically accurate. This meaning that when the band is playing their song the animation isn't random strumming, drumming and keyboard playing, the animation matches up with how you'd play it in real life on real instruments. KyoAni did an amazing job here. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nIt's a music anime, what'd you expect? The songs and sound are amazing. First I'll start with the OST. The OST is a perfect mood setter and captures perfectly the scenes it is used in, it is always used at the perfect time which just strengthens how great this show is. Now the songs, simply put they are phenomenal. Fuwa Fuwa Time is catchy and gets stuck in my head all the time, Pure Pure Heart is legitimately such a good song, Fude Pen was a nice change of style, etc. There are also a lot more songs not in the anime that you can listen to (like songs sung by Ritsu, Azusa, Mugi, even Nodoka and more) if you like what you hear. Also as for the OP's and ED's, Go Go Maniac! and Listen are insanely catchy and Utauyo!! Miracle and No Thank You are great songs and have amazing animations. As for the voice acting, it's downright the best voice acting I've ever heard in anything ever. They all sound distinct and unique. The VA's play their roles so well its crazy, they are such a perfect cast. Mio and Yui's VA's also have to sing in character, which is super impressive.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10:\\n\r\nK-On!! has the greatest characters of all time. Yes, I am going there. I have never seen a more likable cast of characters in my entire life. Even the weaker characters in my opinion like mugi are phenomenal. In this section, I'll briefly go over why every major character is so great. Mugi is super sweet and kind. Mio is always looking out for the group's back, and has great development to boot. Ui is the type of sibling everyone would want. Nodoka has really clever utilization and fits the role of Yui's childhood friend perfectly. Ritsu is insanely funny and has amazing interactions with Mio. Sawa-chan can get a bit grating with the dress-up scenes, but she really does care about the girls (she's funny as well). Azusa also looks out for the band well, while also being the precious little junior for the seniors. Yui is honestly my favorite character, she is so likable and charming. She's stupid at first it seems, but then you realize that she is actually a genius, just at a couple of things. Her clutzy nature is just so amazing, I find myself laughing at every joke she makes or funny thing she does.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nEverything I've gone over so far is what makes this anime so enjoyable, but there is one thing I didn't mention. Someone who cant personally connect to the characters and settings around them may not enjoy it as much as someone who did. But if you can get emotionally connected like me and a ton of others did, you'll see how enjoyable this show is.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nAmazing story, characters, art, music and more just culminate and make this masterpiece of a show. Connect to this show and you WILL feel something. This connection and bond you see in the characters will show you how great this anime is. As long as you get emotionally invested in what's going on, prepare for an amazing emotional rollercoaster, one that you will never want to end.\\n\\n",

There were parts in this season that actually had a bit of an emotional impact on me.\r\n- Writing is also drastically improved in comparison to the previous season.  Incredibly charming and quite humorous once in a while.\r\n- While not too much different from season 1, the colors are more vibrant and well suited to the series.\r\nCons:\r\n- Not much I can really think of.  Anything I can think of would mostly be nitpicks or things related to differing preferences in anime.\r\nOverall:\r\nWhile I wouldn't skip it entirely (namelyfor certain context clues and the immortal line \"fun things are fun\") you could almost skip the entire first season and go on straight to this one.  In some cases I would actually recommend it.  I now finally understand why this anime is so beloved.  It's not deep or anything, its just simple, charming, adorable fun.  If that's what you're looking for, this is where I would direct you towards.",

            "content": "Before anything else, I already forgot my original thoughts for this review because I was supposed to write it over a year ago. \r\nSo.. Uhh...\r\nWhat was this series about again? Oh right.. Tea parties.. oh wait no.. \r\nSlice of Life! That must be it right? It must be slice of life.. What? Wrong again?\r\nWell.. it doesn't really matter anyway.. \r\nFor the people who just finished the first season and wonder if they should continue to this next one but hesitate because of the episode count being doubled from the first season, well... Yes... there is a point to this sequel. But yes, I'm going tobe honest and give a slight spoiler here. \\n\\n\r\nThe shenanigans will continue.. \\n\\n\r\nK-On!! is still a slice-of-life, comedy anime.. Yes.. the moe does not stop!!\\n\r\nSo.. is that good? Uhhh.. not really... but it is for some people.. But to be honest, it ain't really that bad.. it's just.. something.... something you should never tell anyone. No one will appreciate it if you just suddenly yell out: \" I enjoy moe!!!\" So.. yes.. that's the truth. \\n\\n\r\nSo regarding questions about comparison with its prequel, yes... I can say there was improvement because the first season wasn't really that great, I admit. So can we now all agree to finally say that K-On!! is a good anime? Well... I can't really say anything about that. But maybe it's fine now to recommend to your friends. But I doubt that will happen because I've never really seen others recommend this show. Not the common viewers to be precise. But me, yes I was recommended to see this but not for the moe, but as a musician. And.. honestly, we don't view this show as something really great. In fact, we make fun of it and use it as meme material. \\n\\n\r\nBut, that does not mean we berate this show awfully. Sure there are times when the plot gets really boring but that does not stop you from fully enjoying the aesthetics of this show. As a musician, I enjoyed the soundtrack and I also appreciate the detail of the \"Music\" genre of this series. Not many anime show real-life depictions of instruments and brands accurately. Kyoto Animation still did its purpose as displaying the cute style of anime but I'm glad that they did not overdo it for both seasons. \\n\\n\r\nWell.. K-On!!, may not be a masterpiece but it is one of the top music anime for me regardless of the moe. Houkago Tea Time is a really excellent band and the songs are catchy enough for you to remember for a long time. Of all the things that happened in the series, one thing it speaks out is that make sure you enjoy the things and people that you have with you now. Everything has an end and there's only a limited time you can cherish those moments.",

            "content": "When you call an anime \"Moe\", you think of cute girls doing cute things. Boiled down, K-On! is indeed about cute girls doing cute everyday things, which, to some, may seem mundane and boring. It lacks deep, complex plotlines. It doesn't flip the script on past shows of it's kind. The plot is mediocre and unlayered. But watching these girls live through school life, eat cake, drink tea and sometimes play music just fills you with a certain warmth that you cannot explain to judgemental friends that call you a lolicon.  K-On! has a lovable, quirky cast that keep you from getting bored dueto the lack of plot. The mishaps, minute conflicts and yuru moments make for a great show to kick back and relax to.\\n\\n\r\nIt has great visuals, smooth transitions and great OPs and EDs. The EDs especially give HTT a new, interesting aesthetic. The scenes where they actually perform also deserve a mention due to the great quality of animation. Some of the gigs actually had me head-banging and foot-tapping against my will. \\n\\n\r\nK-On manages to induce feels despite it's situations being quite the opposite if tense, as watching a kawaii girl-band achieve their dreams and build friendships hits a lot closer to home than going on grand adventures that decide the fate of the world. I really enjoyed K-On, it managed to make my lonely, weeb self smile and feel warm on the inside.",

But I cannot bypass comparison between K-On! (first season) and K-On!! (second one). And yes, minor spoilers can be ahead, but due to anime plot, they will not matter. \r\nSo our old friends Yui, Mio, Mugi, Ritsu and Azusa as always drink tea in every possible oc\u0441asion... uh, I mean, they play together in the light music club. And just as in the first season, mostly there are no important problems, and all comedy stands on somefunny little moments, where our girls will be looking so moe and fantastic, that you will forget about everything. Something does not changes (and it good for me), but something changes (and it kind of double-edged sword). But it still 10/10 with no doubt. \\n\\n\r\n==Story==\\n\r\nMostly absent, but, unlike in the first season, there is one general direction of the story, especially at the second half of season. The graduation is near, for four girls from K-On! it is the last year at school. So here goes new important questions about future, about friendship and about the club. Such things create somewhat serious flavor. Absolute carelessness of the first season become just simple carelessness in second. Some series near the end of the show are more serious, but with Yui, it just can't be so for long.\\n\\n\r\nStill, as in the first season, the story is built around a comedy of some single moments. Girls beat it without some real troubles, we had small laugh, and here goes another one.... And so on.\\n\\n\r\n==Characters==\\n\r\nNothing changes in this chapter. Yui still careless and sometimes stupid. Ritsu still acts boyish and joke around Mio, Mugi still had her fetishes and act strange, Mio fear everything, and Asuza is cute and trying to really play some music. They are still ideal girls in the ideal world. \\n\\n\r\nBut in this season more time get secondary characters: Ui, Jun, Nodoka and Sawako-sensei. This characters appears often near main characters and create some life around. Other secondary characters appear too, classmates quit being faceless. \\n\\n\r\nIn some moments I even notice some characters progress in Yui case. She studied more, play guitar more and other stuff. But maybe it was an accident.\\n\\n\r\n==Music and Art==\\n\r\nOk, Kyoto Animation create decent animation, characters is cute and moe, what you need more?\\n\\n\r\nAnd music, well, it good. It really good, old songs are present with new one. And you can now notice, that it is anime about music club. ED (both of them) - are one of the best that I hear. OP, as for me are not so good as in the first season, but still decent.\\n\\n\r\n==Enjoyment==\\n\r\nAlmost same as in the first season, but some new emotions appears. Sadness about ending of school life of girls and of anime, it nice, but now I can't suggest this anime as absolutely perfect anti-depression one.\\n\\n\r\n10/10 - I love it really much.",

            "content": "(This will be a review for the whole K-on series, so I will discuss some aspects from season1 and the movie. But I`ll generally stick to season2)\r\n K-on was the animation that led me into the world of anime watching, so It means a lot to me as you can see it on my nickname. I actually saw the series in summer 2015, and a bit later, I graduated myself so I kind of identified with the story too. I can truly say that this is the anime of my life.\r\n Well, I admit it. The story is a bit loose when it comes toseason2. This happened because KyoAni never planned of making season2. They planned it to be a one season Anime, so they crammed year1 and year2 into just 12 episodes. The story flow is actually too fast in season 1; Azusa joins-She gets disappointed-They all go on a so-called 'special training'-Mio and Ritsu fights-Concert. All this happens in just 5 episodes. The result? They have to squeeze out 24episodes for just year3. They story flow would have been perfect if they had placed 12episodes for each year. As a fan, the 24epsiodes of season2 was just fabulous, but it could have been quite boring to some. However, that is a flaw for all slice-of-life genre animes so it isn't a problem limited to K-on.\\n\r\n The other minor downside is that it's hardly related to music; just Houkago Tea Time could have also made a great name.\\n\r\n Despite that, the story is very touching when it comes to the end. The scene in s02e20 where everybody cries after the last concert is just heartbreaking. What about the scene in s02e24 and the movie where the rest of HTT sings 'I met an angel' to Azusa, THAT's what we call touching. Also, Kyoani caught every small detail from the story. For instance, the doll Yui brought home from the big cleaning day appears several times again in the anime in Yui's house. These small details make the story enjoyable.\\n\r\nThe artwork can't be said 'outstanding' these days, but think of 2009 and 2010. It was quality artwork compared to the animes that came out then, and there isn't a big struggle even if we watch in today. \\n\r\n One of the biggest advantages K-on has is its songs. Starting from it's  famous 'fuwafuwa time' there are many other great songs; the OPs and EDs like GO GO maniac, don't say lazy, singing!, No thank you, Utauyo! Miracle, and many others such as Honey sweet tea time, Samidare 20 love, Ichigo parfait ga Tomaranai and much more. It has a lot of songs compared to other animes, and I think this is one of the reason K-on! is still remembered in 2017.\\n\r\n K-on also has quite diverse characters. The five main characters Yui, Tsumugi, Ritsu, Mio and Azusa are all a bit different from each other but they're great when mixed together. This makes the story much more interesting. Not only the main characters, other characters like Sawako, Zun and Ui also each have their own 'thing'. Every character has his/her(mostly her) have a distinguishing point. The supporting roles, such as Ichigo, all have an official behind-story. The characters are the part of K-on that I like the most.\\n\r\n This is it for the review, and I want to end it with a line mentioned in the series.\\n\r\n\"Azusa, Houkago Tea Time will Always be Houkago Tea Time\" -Hirasawa Yui-",

            "content": "So, K-ON! This musical band centred anime, which is not a *musical* comedy, has now finished its second round. What can I tell you about it, huh?\r\nFirst of all, K-ON!! is still not about music. It drifted even more away from that direction, and I found that hardly surprising. This show is character-driven, therefore the setting doesn\u2019t play first fiddle here. But that is a little disappointing, because I expected more insert songs, since the second season received twice the length of the first one and it was an awaited project. However, the featured music takes not by number, but by quality, with my favouritebeing Love and the second ending theme. Oh, and that background melody, which is reminiscent of Hot Butter\u2019s Popcorn, is a really catchy tune because of that resemblance.\\n\\n\r\nThe visual part of K-ON!! is done well: detailed backgrounds and fluid animation, as expected from KyoAni. These guys once again prove that they have one of the best drawing teams among the animation studios.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now to the plot. The girls are spending another year at school. Full stop. Seriously, series like Azumanga Dai\u014d, Minami-ke and K-ON! don\u2019t need such thing like plot. Whether they successful or not, depends solely on characters\u2019 appeal to the audience and situation humour, and K-ON!! definitely has attractive traits. Being just a moe blob anime in whole, it goes without any patsu shots or jiggling breasts, which differs it straight away from such series like Strike Witches, another famous show of the same type. In general, K-ON!! is pure and blithe plus it has more detailed character development than your average moe anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe role of the central character is shifted from Hirasawa Yui to Nakano. She becomes the first fiddle of K-ON!! (or the first guitar, so to say\u2026 no, wait, she is a rhythm guitarist, therefore\u2026 damn, forget it, I screwed up this metaphor) and develops most from the cast throughout the course of the story. The creators try to show up her feelings about all sempai graduating and her becoming the sole member of light music club, and I think that goes better than the first season\u2019s theme of Hirasawa Yui\u2019s growing as person. Also there are some episodes dedicated not to four original members of H\u014dkago Teatime to the \u201calternate trio\u201d, as I call them: Nakano, Hirasawa Ui and Whatshername from the jazz club. Looks like KyoAni was conducting experiments to figure out what to do next with K-ON! franchise, but that actually brought up some pleasant variety for the show.\\n\\n\r\nThus the second season has some positive changes with stronger characterization comparing it to the first one, and it has some negative changes with most of the show musical themes disappearing. They already were thin in the first season, but in K-ON!! we lost them almost completely. However, K-ON! nicely maintained its position of one of the best shows surfing the moe tsunami, so my overall score for it is 8 points. Now I\u2019m interested in what the film will bring to us.",

            "content": "It's the final year before Yui Hirasawa and company will  graduate, leaving behind a single kouhai to carry forward the Light Music Club. Tea & cakes included! We follow 5 normal highschool girls as they make music, study, worry about their futures, individually and as a whole, deepen their friendships and live their life.\r\n Kyoto Animation's K-On!, whose popularity took many people by surprise, has received a second season, distinguished by the extra exclamation mark. I'll be presenting an unbiased review of K-on!!, followed by a 'personal' view on the anime. This may contain slight spoilers!\r\nStory (7) - K-on!! is a slice-of-life anime abouthighschool girls who form a band. Which means that it is trying to depict what would happen in the normal, everyday lives of 5 random girls who decide to form a band. There is no grand scheme, no overarching plot, and no dramatic final\u00e9. Most people state the K-On!! has no plot development, which is both true and false depending on how you look at it. First of all, there is no major plot to be considered in the first place. Does your everyday life have a grand overarching plot? Mine doesn't. I get up from bed, work, eat, relax and go back to sleep again. So why on earth would you want a slice-of-life show to have a plot?\\n\r\nSecondly, for an anime that's supposed to be light-hearted, there are a few time during the final episodes where one might get very emotional. One such scene for me is the scene where all the girls are gathered in the music room after giving their last highschool performance together. The interactions between the characters and their individual breakdowns in this scene has been so meticulously animated and brought to life, that one 'feels' the characters emotions. It is probably the most important scene in the whole season, as it is the culmination of all their years in school, and the final days of their carefree highschool life. For what it promises, it delivers. It doesn't promise to be a drama-heavy, dialogue oriented anime, so I don't expect that. It promises to be a slice-of-life anime and that, it delivers perfectly.\\n\r\nIt is unusual for people to cry during an anime that's supposed to be relaxing and light-hearted, but K-On!! achieves just that. I think when an anime makes you feel deeply for the characters, feel 'involved' with them,  it truly is a fine piece of work.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9) - With the second season, Kyoto Animation (or KyoAni as fans like to say) seems to have pulled out all the stops in animation. The details are painfully crisp & neat, and the motions are fluid. Each of the side characters and supporting cast has a unique face and a unique character design. But the sheer detail can only be picked apart with a re-watch and a fine toothpick.The facial expressions are nicely done, but I think the part most people will agree on is the attention to detail paid on the instruments themselves and the finger actions of the girls. The fingers of the girls gliding over their frets and keys or thumping the drums are meticulously animated, and the instruments are as 'real-life' as they get, which makes it a delight to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7) - The OPs and EDs this time are a tad bit more mature than last season's. That only becomes apparent when you read the lyrics though. But being a music oriented anime, they've belted out an impressive collection of songs, with topics ranging from caramel sauce & strawberry parfaits to rebelling against yourself and showing your deepest feelings for someone you took for granted. And as usual, they are catchy, sometimes even head-banging material.\\n\r\nThe OST music is good, but sometimes, they fail to set the mood for the current scene, which is what OSTs are for. Individually, they are nice little pieces of music, but their implementation in the anime sometimes goes off the mark. Of-course, there are also time where the OST is bang on with the scene, which makes it even better.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (6) - There is no massive streak of ingenuity visible here. You have the quiet rich girl; the hyper tomboyish girl; the air-headed ditzy girl; the mature girl, and the cat-ears girl. All are pretty generic in the slice of life genre, but what KyoAni does is just add a subtle nuance to each of their traits in the this season which makes it certainly refreshing. The air-headed girl who supposedly should be at the receiving end of pity from the others gets a generous helping of raw talent, which garners her respect; the mature one gets a shy and scared personality, which is a shift from the supposed authority and aura a mature person projects; the tomboyish one shows signs throughout various scenes in this season of considering a more feminine side of her and one who is insecure about her friendships, whilst usually, this personality is depicted as somewhat insensitive; the quiet rich girl, who usually remains a wall-flower, shows us that she has inhibitions, doubts, fears, hopes and dreams like any of us, the nekomimi who usually does generic fanservice, matures into a dependable kouhai, who breaks down at the thought of her seniors leaving and managing the Club all by herself.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10) - It's a slice-of-life anime about highschool girls, their interactions, their school life and their band. It's about friendship, growing up, leaving behind and having fun while you can. Chances are, if you like any of those above, you're gonna enjoy K-On!!. It is not just a 'moe blob' or 'cute girls doing cute things' all of the time. You have to look just a little deeper to find out that there is much more than that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7) - I did the average of Story, Art, Sound, Character & Enjoyment, which came out to be 7.8, but for the critique in me, I've rounded it down to 7. In this culmination, K-On!! doesn't sweep the viewer of their feet, it gently takes your hand and shows you a little side to highschool friendships, memories and youth, and then gently puts you down to reminisce about it. It isn't a story about the music or the band, it's a story about the characters themselves. It's about seishun, as the japanese say, and about how the little things in life come together to make it that much sweeter.\\n\\n\r\nMy Personal Opinion - Alright, we're done. You've successfully read through my wall of text and hopefully it wasn't biased. And, I've hopefully haven't blatantly stated why everyone should love or hate this anime, but given you the tools to decide for yourself. After all, I don't believe in reviews unless I've seen the series myself. A review should provide you with more information than the synopsis, and the tools for helping you decide about watching this anime or not. It should not make the decision for you.\\n\r\nAs a personal score, I would give K-On!! 10/10. Maybe the fact that I am a highschooler could have influenced this fact too, but there have been very few animes which have affected and influenced me as deeply as K-On!! My first impression was of a feel-good, light hearted, slice-of-life show, which then gave me a big dose of waterworks at the end which was unexpected. There is a sea of emotions beneath the seemingly normal exterior. And normal doesn't always mean boring, does it? Most of us are normal. And our daily lives are sometimes boring too, right? But if you notice, the story in K-On!! could be possible anytime, anywhere. There could be a group of friends in their music room somewhere in this world right now, having tea and chit-chatting about the cultural festival or how tough the math paper was. It's so obvious and common, that many people can't wrap their minds around the simplicity, yet power of K-On!!.\\n\r\nK-On!! also scores points for realism. We don't have fighting robots, werewolves, kids with superpowers or a dialogue-heavy, dramatic and gripping plot in our daily life, do we? So why have things like these in an anime that's supposed to be a slice-of-life? It's meant to be taken with a light mind and soul, that ends up soothing out your mind and refreshing it, leaving you to reminisce, and maybe smile a little at your own highschool life.\\n\\n\r\n~Until next time....",

            "content": "Just Finished K-On!! (Both seasons and will most likely have this same review for the 2nd Season Review page, just because they're the same Anime.)\r\nMy expectations for it may have been high, But I will say, It didn't disappoint.\r\nIt was great all around, It had its Happy Moments, Its (somewhat) serious moments, but most of it was all fun.  The music was Great(and incredibly Addicting).  Especially their one song that you hear most of the time;\r\n\"Fuwa Fuwa Time\"\r\nAs for Story, the Story was kind of Hard to Follow, But in a Good Way.  Thats whats to fun about this one.  Ifyour Looking for Deep story in a Musical Anime, look for Tari Tari or something like that.  This one is Just for Fun, and Enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art was \"old-fashioned\" in a good way as well.  Compared to all the new anime, where its like, I cant quite explain it, but the Art in this one was Great for the type of anime it was.  Each type of thing symbolised what each character had.  With Kotobuki's Enormus Eyebrows symbolizing that she was the daughter of the guy that owned that music store, or that the Hair Style Between Ui and Yui symbolised who was more childish and who was the more serious one.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound in terms of the Music was FANTASTIC!  The songs were really catchy, and the names were really cheery and happy.  it made me smile every time their songs were playing, and it made me want to hear the whole thing(because they always seemed to cut off)\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters were...  Odd, but thats whats refreshing about this anime.  Its different from the rest, and I really liked that about this one.  With Yui's Child-like Attitude, or Meo's Seriousness, It made it fun whenever they were all talking about something, and then something would happen, and someone would do something funny then they'd all laugh.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment?  Heh.  HELLZ YEAH I ENJOYED IT!!!  It was Catchy, Fun, and Incredibly Addicting to sing Fuwa Fuwa Time everytime they would sing it.  When they would sing their songs during the Cultural Festivals, I would Clap with the song.  It was an anime that had me sucked in to the very end.(Season 2 as well)\\n\\n\r\nOverall, It was Great, and Different and I really Liked it.\\n\\n\r\nThe Name of the band was \"After-school Tea Time(H\u014dkago t\u012btaimu)\" or HTT for Short.\\n\r\nThe way they had the characters set up was, kinda weird, but I liked it. It was different from you usual Song Type anime.  It was always bringing something fun to each episode and I was looking forward to the next episode after I would finish the last.\\n\\n\r\nHighly Recommend it to Anyone looking to have a great time.",

The reason that I watched k-on is that its an awesome anime, it has a great story and one thing that really made me love k-on is thatthey play great music that speaks to the soul, even if it is in japanese, I still loved listening to it because even if you can't understand the lyrics of the song, its like you understand the meaning of the song, because music is UNIVERSAL. One more thing is that they play real branded instruments like Mio's 3-color Sunburst Fender Jazz Bass, Yui's Gibson Les Paul Standard, Asuza's Fender Mustang Electric Guitar, Mugi's piano (I don't know the brand, sorry.XD) and Ritsu's Yellow Rick Marotta  Signature Yamaha Hipgig Drumkit w/ Zildjian cymbals. I'm in a band myself and I'm happy that this anime is different from the other anime's that play their instruments while their chords are only their hands on the guitar and they just slide their hands while in k-on, they actually use real chords while jamming in the anime. I actually know how to play Fude pen boru pen, I learned to play it because its a great song. So if you know a guy who watches k-on, don't criticize them and call them gay because k-on is an anime for both gender, and if you know  a guy who's favorite tv show is barbie, that's a different story.XD.sorry if i offended some people because of my review. this review is just my point of view.:D",

            "content": "To be quite honest, I didn't particularly enjoy the first season. A 7 at best, for me. TLDR at bottom. \r\nBut the second season, I believe, it gave the greater character development that I enjoy. First things first, let's get the common things over with. Yes, it is a moe anime. Yes, the music hardly plays a role (it does in the second season though). Yes, there is no plot. \r\nHowever, I did not let this be unenjoyable. The characters were drawn well and I find that the lack of story was made up by the moe + characters. I found that most the characterswould grow and develop in some sense. I would like to see a continuation of the series, instead of ending at high school graduation though. Such as the trip! \\n\\n\\n\r\n----> TLDR <------\\n\\n\r\nStory: I realise it doesn't exist but somehow I kept pressing next episode button. So I give it 8. \\n\\n\r\nArt: I think the art is noticeably improved in this season and there is a lot more detail. It is beautiful, not perfect, but very nice to look at.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Um, even though I am preferring classical, I still liked the music. OP and ED was good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: As referenced before, the development of character is better over the course of the 2 season combined. They are not all static.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Cute\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10",

            "content": "*This is for both seasons and not including the movie*\r\nSlice of life is a genre that isn\u2019t for everyone. Not everybody can appreciate a story that mainly deals with a person\u2019s mundane everyday life and I get that. There is nothing wrong if you don\u2019t like slice of life- I hate to admit it but I can\u2019t seem to get into sports anime. But anyway that\u2019s not what I am here to talk about.\r\nK-On is an anime that is popular and beloved beyond belief, despite being mainly slice of life. However, it is also infamous for influencing this whole heated debate on moe. But,despite all that bullshit, how is K-On as a standalone series? Well, let\u2019s find out today.\\n\\n\r\nK-On starts of telling the story of five different girls starting of high school. They are part of the school\u2019s light music club where they constantly slack off and do nothing but drink fancy tea and eat delicious cake. That\u2019s it- that is basically the show in a nutshell . You can\u2019t get more slice of life than that, can you? \\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I didn\u2019t have high expectations for K-On- but at the same time I didn\u2019t think I was going to end up agreeing completely with the people who bash it just because it\u2019s cute girls doing cute things. However, I personally believe there is indeed more to K-on than people give it credit for. I have watched a lot of slice of life and I guarantee that K-On is some of the best slice of life I have ever watched. \\n\\n\r\nThere isn\u2019t anything unique or interesting about K-On\u2019s story because I can name a dozen anime from the top of my head that features high schoolers in a club. Half of them I am pretty sure are also done by KyoAni. K-On had a relatively weak start, and I just couldn\u2019t get into the story. But, after forcing myself for four episodes- I finally reached the part where the show became something I looked forward to watching. I think that was because it started off as basic as possible and so I ended up finding the earlier episodes bland.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, as the characters started to grow on me and also with the addition of great supporting characters is when- K-On started being quite refreshing. One thing that constantly kept me interested was the show\u2019s comedy. The comedy of the show despite being nothing gut busting like Gintama or School Rumble- still managed to keep me thoroughly entertained. You will notice that there are several running gags which works really well throughout the long run of the show. Which proves how GIFs and memes that this show generated. \\n\\n\r\nK-On has a great cast characters which is mainly female, and some characters do stand out from the others. And those that don\u2019t, still manage to be very pleasant. The main characters mainly consist of the incredibly dumb Yui Hirasawa, sweet and shy Mio Akiyama, tomboyish and mischievous Ritsu Tainaka, the wealthy and weird Tsumugi Kotobuki and finally the serious but still adorable Azusa Nakano- who happens to be their kouhai. \\n\\n\r\nDespite, all the characters having some sort of stereotype- I feel like they end up becoming more than just what I described them to be. These characters are frankly really charming, likable, and relatable and honestly there wasn\u2019t a single character that I disliked. I actually shared a lot of characteristics with a lot of these characters- making me love them more than I expected them to. '\\n\\n\r\nWe see these girls grow over the course of this this anime, little by little. They do somewhat still feel unchanged in terms of behavior and personality by the end, but I feel like that\u2019s alright. K-On is a pretty light hearted series where hardly anything dramatic happens- so to have them go through major character development is out of the question. It wouldn\u2019t work for this type of show and I am glad that wasn\u2019t the case. It was a bit unrealistic- how their high school lives seemed like so much fun- when in real life that is far from the truth. Well, from my experience I can guarantee that. \\n\\n\r\nK-On did attempt at some dramatic moments that I feel actually harmed the story rather than helping it. But, that only happened once during season 1 after which the show didn\u2019t have any which was good in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters however did change in the sense that they grow to care deeply for each other and of course for their small club. The friendships in this anime were highly engaging and memorable and it didn\u2019t feel forced or incredibly saccharin. These girls had great chemistry with each other, as just friends that is. Seeing their bonds becoming stronger throughout the series was one of the highlights of the series.  They also had a great relationship with their teacher Ms Namako, who is also a hilarious and epic character might I add. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of great relationships, Yui and her younger sister the sophisticated and mature Ui had one of the best sibling relationships in anime period. It isn\u2019t just adorable how much they love and cherish each other- but the moments they shared felt genuine too. When Yui wrote a song about how she appreciates Ui, I almost got teary eyed. \\n\\n\r\nAs for other cons of the series, the story dragged towards end making me feel as if it was three episodes too long. Yes, there were some emotional and heartfelt moments- but the show could have still concluded in a better way in my opinion. But, it still ended thank god for that. I didn\u2019t have to deal with the same BS presented to me by both Hyouka or the Haruhi franchise.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, out of all the characters, I would say that Tsumugi\u2019s personality kind of felt underwhelming compared to the others. But, with time she too becomes really likeable despite how plain she might be in comparison. That was mainly due to her curiosity and desire to break free from her life as a rich girl and do something normal like joining the light music club. Also, let\u2019s not forget her desperate need for some yakisoba. Oddly, enough she might not the most interesting but she is still one of my favourites. We also don\u2019t learn much about her and Asuza which I felt like was an injustice- because we got to know a lot about Mio, Ritsu, Yui. Given how they too are the main characters, I felt that was unfair- even a just a little would have been good. \\n\\n\r\nThe moe  on the other hand, wasn\u2019t bad in my opinion. I have seen shows in the past with unnecessary and cringy moe- but K-On doesn\u2019t fall in that category in my opinion. Yes, I did feel sometimes they overdid the cute Mio moments where she gets scared or nervous- but that even stopped being excessive as the show progressed. So, the moe wasn\u2019t a problem for me in this show. It didn\u2019t make me go \u2018aww\u2019 or anything- but I didn\u2019t mind it at all honestly. What was excessive however was the gag of how dumb Yui is- it was funny at first- but then I just got tired with it. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for K-On is pretty kickass, despite being songs with weird titles and often sung with cutesy moe voices . The main song the band plays Fuwa Fuwa Time is one of my favourites and I personally love both the versions. The first opening of K-on is something I wish I could include in my Top 50 Anime Openings List. If I do update that list in the future, then expect this one there. All the ending songs are excellent too, but the first one Don\u2019t Say Lazy is my absolute favourite and is probably in my Top 5 now when it comes to favourite anime ending themes. So, I was quite pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed K-On\u2019s music- because for this type of anime it not only suits, it but adds a lot of greatness too.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSince, it\u2019s KyoAni I don\u2019t need to go into detail how good it is. Granted not as stunning as its recent works- but still pretty good even compared to most airing anime nowadays- with them paying special importance to small details which I have always loved about KyoAni. \\n\\n\r\nI really also liked the character designs despite it being what you come to expect from KyoAni- but I felt that they made Azusa and Mio look too similar. Like I am okay with the Yui and Ui thing cause I find it funny- but the Mio and Asuza one bugged me. Not only that but there was this other background character that looked exactly like Mio with glasses. I swear KyoAni, be a bit more creative with your character designs- I doubt it\u2019s confusing only me.\\n\\n\r\nThe English dub is actually pretty good too, thanks to the very talented cast. My personal favourite was Stephanie Sheh who gave an excellent performance as our lord and savior Yui Hirasawa- making sure to bring out the cuteness and hilarious personality of the character. But, if you want the full moe effect then the sub is great too, but I watched it mainly in dub being the cringy weeboo I am.\\n\\n\r\nK-On is an anime that I feel got consistently got better, as you get more invested into these characters. If you like them, which isn\u2019t that hard of a thing to do then you will you feel as if you too have grown up and experienced all the fun times that the Houkago Tea Time club did for the course of three years. You see them grow and bond with one another- which can be really touching at times. \\n\\n\r\nThe show has a weak start and finish but everything in between is just oh so good and never failed to make me happy inside with a goofy smile on my face. So, I am going to award K-On with an 8 and that it is WORTH THE WATCH. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a series, that I didn\u2019t think I was going to enjoy and basically checked out because it was one those popular series I hardly touched. Little did I know, that I would end up loving the show and that I would end up cherishing all the characters. I should make it perfectly clear for once and for all this isn\u2019t an anime for everyone- especially if you can\u2019t appreciate the presence of these characters or enjoy slice of life in general.  In fact, you\u2019ll love this show as much as I did maybe even more if you saw these girls as the best friends you always wanted. So, if you need five waifus to ruin your life, then look no further than K-On.\\n",

The voice actors are well suited to their roles and the characters are simple with their own distinct characteristics. The art is unique and recognizable - I realized right away that the art crew for Tamako Market was the same as K-On! The story is a bit bland and theres no episode that stands out, but it suits the anime. Go to school, go to the light music club room and eat, maybe play a little bit? I also like this anime a lot more just because I pickedup the guitar and bass after the third time watching this anime (as ridiculous as it sounds, but probably the best decision of my life playing the guitar)\\n\\n\r\nA simple, sweet anime that serves as a good time killer/study break(it doesn't get addicting)!",
