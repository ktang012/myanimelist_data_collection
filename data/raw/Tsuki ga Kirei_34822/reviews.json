            "content": "It is true that school-life is one of the most common genres in Japanese animation. From specialty school (magic, cooking etc) to school-life with mysteries or supernatural. In short, it is a genre that has been widely exploited in all respects. As for Tsuki ga Kirei, it doesn't pretend to revolutionize the genre and doesn't propose an original plot at first.\r\nIn fact Tsuki ga Kirei is exceptional in its simplicity. The relationships between the different characters are particularly well developed. The series accurately combines the gestures, facial expressions of the characters without exaggerating the reactions, which in some scenes may seem surprising and unexpected. Theseries doesn't necessarily focus on the dialogues and emphasizes the subtlety of the reactions of the characters making the relationships very realistic.\\n\r\nThe other point is the meeting of our two protagonists: Akane and Kotarou. Initially they don't know each other. They notice briefly in the classroom and do not talk to each other. Their relationship is built slowly but surely. At first, they look at each other several times discreetly, meaning that they are interested in each other. Then, following certain trivial events, they meet several times. Of course, you may be a little irritated by their behavior because they are shy and because they do not dare look at each other to discuss. But gradually they learn to know each other.Also social networks play an important role in their relationship and in general we notice the omnipresence of LINE (very popular in Japan) among students.\\n\\n\r\nThis relationship will gradually evolve into a romantic relation. And with this type of relationship come all the difficulties that go hand in hand, namely the acceptance of the relationship by the entourage and the friends. Jealousy? Envy? Different feelings that lead some characters to interfere in the Akane-Kotarou couple and possibly create love triangles. Do not expect ridiculous infidelities that would be completely out of step with the personality of our protagonists. Of course there will be difficult times calling into doubt the feelings of another or his, wondering how their relationship is solid. And thank God! the series does not propose forced drama with characters who cry to each episode in order to move its audience.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore our characters live with their families. Surprisingly and relatively rare in a school-life, we see the parents of our two protagonists. This aspect contributes to the realism of the series allowing us to see the relationship of our protagonists with their family. Especially that of Kotarou with his mother who regularly opposes his son because the latter privileges his dream of becoming a writer to his studies. Akane's and her sister's relationship is also very interesting, as she often gives advice on Akane's love life. Besides our two protagonists also have their occupations: Akane participates in the athletic club and Kotarou at the festival of the city. The series devotes time to show their perseverance and motivation to achieve their goals. To return to what I was saying on LINE, I was surprised by the modernity of this series. Especially when a publisher recommends Kotarou to write light novels ((Kotarou doesn't seem to know it) or the big sister who laughs when she sees Akane knitting a scarf for Kota. (She also mentions that they are in 2017)\\n\\n\r\nConcerning the secondary characters, Chinatsu and Hira receive a screen time sufficient for their characterization and develop their interests and objectives. For the other characters I wouldn't say they are useless because regularly, in several scenes, some play a prominent role in the Akane-Kotarou relationship. I regret that the series doesn't spend more time for these characters. Although at the end of each episode we see small short films showing funny moments among the various couples formed of these supporting characters. Contrary to our two main protagonists, they have already developed relations. I thank the writer because he has not censored allusions about the nights that the couples spent together.\\n\\n\r\nOn the technical aspects, the artistic direction has the merit of being unique with simple chara-design without weird hair colorings (except Roman lol). The soundtrack plays an important role in creating a peaceful and relaxing atmosphere. But many scenes have no background music, preferring to highlight the sound effects. No use of artifices to reinforce dramatic moments, just discrete tracks. I don't forget the remarkable performances of Nao Touyama in the scenes where the characters don't speak allowing the viewer to rest while contemplating the cityscapes or the daily life of the characters. However I have spotted is the use of the CGI on the characters in the background which is frankly unpleasant and which I hope will be corrected in the blu-ray. (I sometimes feel they limp)\\n\\n\r\nI personally had a great time watching this series. I agree that the series doesn't have a deep or complex plot that allows it to stand out from other works but nevertheless I have no really honest criticism to make it except one or two above-mentioned. The guiding principle of the series has always been respected and has mantain a certain coherence from beginning to end. If you are looking for a school-life with genuine relationships, I can only recommend that you throw yourself on it. On the contrary, if you prefer school-life with redundant gags and more eccentric characters, the series is not for you. However, I think Tsuki ga Kirei is a unique experience that should be watched by anyone looking for novelty.",

            "content": "When attempting to define romance, a few notions come to mind: a feeling of excitement, a remoteness from the mundaneness of everyday life, or perhaps a quality of mystery. These are the qualities that litter the romance genre today. However, one cannot discount the impact that simpler techniques create; subtle changes in body language during an involving conversation, an alter in the pitch of a voice after an unexpected text, or the absence of any background music so that any impertinent buffer is removed at a crucial developmental moment. It is in these archaic ways that Tsuki ga Kirei manages to strike me as notjust a school romance, but as a relevant and relatable tale of finding acceptance in one\u2019s self. By adapting these aforementioned techniques, it is no wonder that Tsuki ga Kirei is seen as an excellently produced tale in the field of romance.\\n\\n\r\nBefore embarking on Tsuki ga Kirei\u2019s 'emotional roller-coaster', or often lack there of, there's a key symbolic concept that is readily used throughout the series\u2019s run-time and that involves the use of the moon. There is a saying that goes as such: \u201cThe moon teaches us that darkness can\u2019t hide the beauty of life if we know how to reflect beauty\u201d. It is with the use of this abstract idea, that the growth of the main characters in the story takes place and how they can break out of their apprehensive shells and eventually find affection for another person. An example which illustrates this is during the ending sequence in each episode where a moon appears on the top right-hand corner of the screen. Starting from a new moon and concluding with a full moon, this imagery hints that in the end the romance between Akane and Kotarou will have been fully realised and will come into fruition. This is further shown, as a full moon is often seen as a symbolism for height of power, the peak of clarity, fullness and obtainment of desire: which in this case is romantic tension. \\n\\n\r\nIn addition to this allegory, quotes from a famous Japanese author, named Osamu Dazai, are tastefully used in each episode. These quotes are directed from Kotarou\u2019s point of view and are applicable to the advancement of the story. In episode 1 the quote \u201cThe feeling of joy is perhaps like a speck of gold, glimmering faintly at the bottom of a river of grief\u201d is used, while in a later episode the recitation \u201cThis is what I want to believe implicitly: Man was born for love and revolution\u201d. These aren\u2019t utilised without any ulterior purpose simply to sound high-witted, but are imperative to give the viewer the ability to follow the state of the story, as well as to read the character\u2019s mind-sets at that point in time: starting from the initial moment when affection is first sparked, until the eventual full-fledged liaison.\\n\\n\r\nAs stated in the introduction, refining of simple techniques are used in Tsuki ga Kirei. These techniques are made use of because in essence, this is a simple story: two middle-schoolers meet by sheer chance and a romance blooms. The advantage of such a straight-forward setting is that the more vital features of a good story are highlighted, while simultaneously a large audience is able to enjoy said story, since there is not a lot of challenging information which needs to be digested first-hand. There are no deeply psychological traits here, nor are there any surreal plot-twists. In all honesty, that is precisely what made this anime so effective to me. All the viewer\u2019s focus is predominantly extended to the relationship between the characters, without much distraction from anything else. Tsuki ga Kirei, in this way, is a profoundly efficient tale as every scene exists simply to further and more strongly achieve a realistic narrative.\\n\\n\r\nCorrespondingly, the efficient nature of the story is accentuated by the barren use of any major drama or comedy segments (in the main story at least). While these attributes are certainly existent, similarly to the quotations of Dazai, they are applied elegantly and are spread enough apart from one another, so that no overwrought or soppy scenes would strive the viewer away from the show's principal backbone; which once again is the successful capturing of a realistic and believable cast of characters set in a logical and credible environment.\\n\\n\r\nThe only issue I personally experienced with Tsuki ga Kirei\u2019s story, ironically (as this is the event that sold most people into becoming infatuated with the show), is with the ending itself. Although beautifully executed, I feel as if it ventured away from what the production attempted to achieve and that is centrally a credible chain of events, but I digress as I was relatively pleased with the finale.\\n\\n\r\nMatching the astounding storytelling, what makes the characters so rational is that they all have their own respective backgrounds, quirks and set of values. This makes each persona their own, instead of relying on tired tropes which bargain on a gimmick to describe their personalities. Equally, one of the most notable achievements in Tsuki ga Kirei is the manner in which the characters enhance each other throughout the series, but more on this later on. Foremost I want to talk about the two protagonists:  Azumi Kotarou and Mizuno Akane, starting with Azumi Kotarou.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is told chiefly from the perspective of Kotarou as he gradually develops a meaningful connection with Akane, while exploring the changes that occurs in his adolescent mind. What makes him such a proper protagonist is that he acts, sounds and thinks like a child in his age. Combining a fascination for classical writing and love for shadow-boxing, he feels like a living, breathing person and in the same fashion as the story he is shown in a diffident, simplistic light, once again rejecting any unnecessary personality traits which would likely distract from his maturation as a teenager. He is an individual filled with a past of embarrassments and regrets; he has felt failure many a time yet he is determined to succeed in the end. The outstanding writing and characterisation allows for Kotarou to feel genuinely authentic as he is not shown to be without flaws, yet simultaneously he has enough motivation in himself so that he is an ever-changing and distinctive person, without the limits seen in typical male protagonists.\\n\\n\r\nAkane is the female leading character and, besides acting precisely how a middle-school girl would, has her own key traits which allows for her to have an ineluctable bond with Kotarou. She too has experienced sorrows such as constantly moving homes and failures such as losing sprinting races despite years of preparation that permits her to have this innate and almost platonic initial connection to Kotarou, as they both share similar experiences and so can converse about their problems together. However, unlike the way in which Kotarou is portrayed, Akane has experienced and tasted success; she achieves high grades in school and readily surpasses her previous record times in track and field. She also often plays with this potato plush toy, which underscores her anxious nature, increasing the amount of realism in her personality. This opposing nature in character, leads to our main male lead to almost yearn for and strive to be like Akane; this leaves the story space to work with and manipulate its run-time and thus leading to maximum evolution in their romantic relationship, which suggests why Tsuki ga Kirei is so efficacious as a romance.\\n\\n\r\nAs previously stated, a remarkable achievement of Tsuki ga Kirei is how different characters enhance each other during the run-time of the show. This enhancement is achieved by the surprising use of both sets of parents of the main characters. For both parties, parents provide much-needed support, be it in a direct way such as motivational talks, or in a laconic and unhurried way such as the making of a celebratory lunch box. Parents are underused in media in my opinion, as more often than not only one parent exists as the focal role for development. This is a waste of good influence, however, as parents are constantly around the characters we follow in stories, so the presence of both a mother and a father is more likely to lead to strengthening of the more relevant characters.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the side-characters do not have as much exposure as Kotarou and Akane, they do a great job of adding gravity and intensity to the relationship between them. They are all well crafted and balanced and often have their own battles and desires, which creates increased tension in the overall atmosphere of the series. Something, however, that I would have liked to have been done better is the reasoning behind the actions that some characters take later on the story. I can\u2019t help but feel as if these were slightly rushed so that the intrinsic romance is focused on instead. In a way this is forgivable, as teenagers often act irrationally and radically, particularly in situations such as love which they may not have as much experience in.\\n\\n\r\nThe art, although once again simple, contributes greatly to the relaxed atmosphere of the anime. Backgrounds are meticulous compared to that of the foreground and the designs of the characters. This, together with the use of blank space and white accenting is perhaps to further emphasise how simple humans, especially in their younger ages, truly are as well as the nostalgic feeling of first falling in love. The facial expressions characters make, although lacking detail, are accurate to the emotions felt at that point in time. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation, however, is more polarising. Despite the fact that many frames are drawn to highlight an accurate representation of a character\u2019s actions, the flow of these frames is commonly ruined by sloppy editing, leading to an almost jerky aesthetic. Furthermore, the use of CGI in the background for crowds of people makes casual movement robotic to say the least. These CGI models don\u2019t carry themselves as fluidly as the drawings do and often end up looking comedic. In retrospect, however, Tsuki ga Kirei\u2019s production team was struggling to release episodes on time, so this is less of an issue concerning talent and more of an issue on time management. \\n\\n\r\nOne of Tsuki ga Kirei's most surmounting achievements for me, were the extra phonetics the voice actors made during a lot of the dialogue segments. This produces an almost lifelike status when hearing characters converse, as their conversations mimicked that of an actual discussion. Not only this, but especially in the opening episodes the awkward disposition between Kotarou and Akane\u2019s relationship was further realised by this effortless technique. Besides this, the voice-acting itself was as well pleasant to listen to, especially knowing how both protagonists\u2019 actors were relative newcomers to the industry, accommodating for a more genuine-sounding series as the viewer relates that unfamiliar voice to the specific character being voiced.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack itself was comprised of some wonderful vocal insert songs and a pleasant array of classical instruments. These were used sparingly and so no particular soundtrack ever felt forced or hackneyed, which is quite rare for a show especially when you have marathon-ed it, like I did. Perhaps a hindrance I felt with the show\u2019s musical score, is that no singular song especially stood out to me. This may, of course, simply be a result of the abundance of different soundtracks used.\\n\\n\r\nFrom its hyper-realistic setting with stunningly crafted backgrounds, to its effortless communication of emotion at just the right times, Tsuki ga Kirei is an anime which promptly came to my surprise from the very first minute of the first episode. Euphoric yet wistful, joyful yet dismal, melancholy yet hopeful, the innate beauty which Tsuki ga Kirei permeates can dispense a wide array of emotions. For myself, this allure lead to tears being shed through almost every episode despite there being no logical reason to. But in shows like these, reason should be the last thought in your mind: \\n\\n\r\njust sit back and cherish the inevitable void you will feel once the 12th episode hits 24:26. \\n\\n\r\nStory - [Score: 8.5/10]\\n\r\nCharacters - [Score: 8.5/10]\\n\r\nAnimation/Art - [Score: 6.5/10]\\n\r\nSound - [Score: 8/10]\\n\r\nEnjoyment - [Score: 9/10]\\n\\n\r\n[Final Score:  8.2/10]\\n\\n\r\nFinal comment:  An absolute marvel of a school romance; there may never be another like it of its caliber for me.",

            "content": "Honestly in my opinion, this show is one of those original work gems that stand out for this season of Spring 2017!\r\nAn Original Work containing Romance, mixed along with Middle School themed characters, plus those awkward and moments we all had at some point in our lives. As what some others have said, I also agree that this show is something refreshing and nice to watch. \r\nThe story has good development overtime. It's not really rushed a lot with tons of scenes and action that was all done in one go. The story progressed at a reasonable good pace. Though, there's a notable amount oftime-lapsing to transition to each episode. I did like the development for the characters too, since it went at a pace that isn't too fast for viewers to try and understand, and not too slow where the viewers will be bored.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is good quality. There were a few scenes that were done well. However, I do have some issues with a few particular scenes that could be revised for the DVD/BD Release. But other than that, I don't think it would affect much for my rating. Art wise for the characters, I liked it, and found Akane cute too. \\n\\n\r\nThe sounds is something that I found pleasant. The casts all fit with the characters represented too. What stood out for me was the noises that Akane makes. \"Eh?\" \"Aah!\" Un!\" Like Kumiko noises. Kotarou on the other hand, \"Ah..\" \"ooh..\" \"Un.\" basically like Akane but a male version. (lol) Though, that did motivate me to work on a video dedicated to both of their noises that I could find from every episode. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters, I don't have much to say (As it also contains spoilers if I do say something about them and the others) but characters that will make you want to like, laugh at, or maybe be going, \"What? No! Don't you dare do that!\" It's a typical range of emotions and stereotypes that you find in Middle/High School. I do find that the staff and producers managed to make the characters feel more interesting instead of bland.\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment with the show was lovely. I did like it how in the ED, there's text conversations that is interesting to read. I do believe someone made a forum post dedicated to translations for the conversations. Anyways, the Shorts after the ending were entertaining too. Some in which are hilarious. When I get my Blu-Ray order in October, I will definitely re watch the show to see if they changed anything from how it was aired this season.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I loved Tsuki Ga Kirei. As I stated, it's one of those original work gems that is both good and refreshing to watch. I've started to support this show by ordering the Blu-Ray. You should too if you enjoyed it! My last thoughts is that it would be lovely to see an OVA or an adaptation (like light novel, manga) for Tsuki Ga Kirei. Who knows what Studio Feel. and the staff members might do for now. Hopefully, maybe something that is good as Tsuki Ga Kirei :)",

Tsuki ga Kirei will fulfill our expectations and more.\r\nEven if the story could be at the beginning simple, it will start advancing in a way that will keep us entertained until the end. The story has excellent pacing and covers the insecurity, the desires, the doubts, the dreams of a group of teenagers. \r\nWe follow the story of a couple from the start until the end (in some way), their names are Akane andKotaru. They are just typical teenagers, and their relation starts from the immaturity and the usual shyness, the fear and the anxiety that can be found in the real world every day. As the relationship progress, we can visualize how the casual insecurity, the distance, and the everyday life issues appear and how they try to surpass them.  From my perspective, that is one of the reasons to watch this anime because in some way we will feel related to that kind of relationship.    \\n\\n\r\nThe anime has a great narrative combined with great visual art, and perfect sound timing creates a masterpiece that you will enjoy. The characters are well developed, they transmit their feelings, emotions to the audience and not only the main ones, but the extra characters also add some atmosphere to the story. \\n\\n\r\nThe music and the songs are great. They used it in the perfect timing, and it doesn't destroy the narrative or the visual. The story is balanced in the perfect sense of the word. \\n\\n\r\nOne last advice, please read the line messages, there are some translations if you don't know Japanese, they are short stories about the relationship and will add more ideas about it. You could try to guess if they are related to them or not :P \\n\\n\r\nYou should try to watch it if you like romance stories and a slice of the life stories. If you are seeking fights, actions or anything different, you should skip this anime. \\n",

            "content": "Tsuki ga Kirei is a boring adolescent romance that masquerades as something more than it is. Subverting standard romance tropes is not something that by default makes a romance any more realistic or compelling if it's still lacking in anything substantive. \r\nThe main couple have a serious lack of chemistry that plagues the show from front to back. Their reservations and quaint interactions are cutely refreshing and much more in line with the actuality of young love than your typical anime portrayal. That said, I still don't understand why they liked each other in the first place or why that feeling only grew over time.They were awkward, but it wasn't just a cute awkward, they legitimately had nothing substantive to talk about, ever. It felt ironically shallow. Nothing particularly exciting happened either, which is fine, or actually it isn't, because I don't watch television or film to be bored out of my mind. I have more pressing things to do than conduct pointless meta-analysis on how a boring anime is actually good because it isn't generic. Uniqueness and quality are not mutually exclusive metrics.\\n\\n\r\nTsuki's side characters are also extremely undeveloped and not impactful. The show employed an interesting technique of having brief side character stories shown after the ED of each episode, but these were far too scattered and simplistic to provide any insight into the actual characters. 'Twas nothing more than some quick laughs arising out of character interactions from characters' faces you sadly may not even recognize or ever see again. Back to the main show, the two romantic foils, who had actual relevant screen-time, disappointingly ended up amounting to nothing more than stale obstacles. There was also no discernible difference between the two's roles in the series. Furthermore, there really wasn't a discernible difference between the two main characters themselves other than gender. The pseudo-plot is that they're very goal oriented and longing to fulfill their dreams. The actual plot is that they're regular kids who aren't interesting to watch and have no business falling in love. \\n\\n\r\nThe art style is a blatant ripoff of Kimi no na Wa. Which is good, in the sense that Kimi no na Wa has a great art style, but somewhat shameless nonetheless. The fonts, the lighting techniques, the environments,.. everything screamed budget Shinkai. I sure hope he gets royalties from this show for inadvertently providing the entire visual framework. There was also a very prevalent usage of CGI for background characters in Tsuki ga Kirei, which was wholly unnecessary and distracting. The CGI was awful and not befitting of modern animation standards. There was also no real need to have crowds of background characters populating every scene. The environments were perfectly fine on their own. The music was decent but nothing notable and the voice acting was very poor. I haven't heard so many audible groans, breaths, and bodily noises since I last watched Dragon Ball Z. Why write actual script when you can pencil in dumb, nonsensical noises?\\n\\n\r\nWatch Kimi ni Todoke or Ao Haru Ride if you want to see shy young people fall in love organically. Those shows are compelling, in part, because high school is an interesting romantic setting. Middle school is not. Please remind me of a middle school romance you remember that wasn't shallow and forced. Tsuki ga Kirei is the most forced romance I've ever watched, personally. That's not enjoyable.",

This show can bring back nostalgia about how dumbfounded we had been when we experienced love in the middle school.\r\nThe art style is very unique with the watercolor palette and will be very distinguishable at the first episode. It\u2019s fitting in the general feel of the show, which is like the reminiscent of our youth days. There\u2019s a lot of great sceneries which somewhat akin to what Makoto Shinkai\u2019s produced in his works.\r\nThe soundtracks help a lot in creating the atmosphere of thescene and are noteworthy. The OP is beautiful yet exciting, the same goes to the ED and insert songs (though both are calmer). All in all, the sounds are working in concert with the art to create a delightful duo for our senses.\\n\\n\r\nBoth of the main characters seem like dandere because of how shy they are except with the ones they\u2019re close to. This helps create heartwarming awkward moments between the two of them. Other supporting characters also show interesting premise for future episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe slow-paced nature of this show may turn away some people off, but actually it\u2019s the strong point. It also occasionally surprises us with the sudden increment of development in the story. This anime might be a hidden gem in this season or maybe this year because of how down-to-earth it is and it might refreshes our not-so-pure self with something as innocent as this.\\n",

Their feelings and circumstances are extremely believable and everything is treated in a very gentle manner. And up to now I have loved every single episode I have seen.\r\n---\r\nI wouldn't normally follow a story about middle-schoolers, however I am not sorry I started watching this. It delivers an overall sweet and considerate story, and is the only decentromance anime that this season has to offer us.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is very down to earth, boy meets girl, they gradually get closer. Although the pacing of the anime seems slow (in terms of how the scenes are constructed), I would say that (at least by shoujo standards) things are actually evolving pretty quickly. I like the story because it feels authentic and earnest and because the characters inner life plays a big role. In this age of lolis, anything human and real is to be appreciated.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation are of perfectly good quality by modern standards, nothing spectacular, but I feel that lots of attention to detail was invested.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters portray what you would expect from a (no frills) 14-year old. They are discovering the world, dealing with their emotions, interests, desires... they are also quite sweet and shy :)\\n\\n\r\nI personally am enjoying this series more and more, I find it sincere and refreshing and feel swept into the characters' emotions. If you like this genre of anime, I encourage people to give it a try, the first two or three episodes should convince you.",

            "content": "Tsuki ga Kirei is like an embarrassing flashback to those days in middle school where you wanted to grow up as fast as possible and do things all the cool adults did. Remember that first time you fell in love from looking at someone, but didn\u2019t know what to do or didn\u2019t have the guts to try it out? Yeah, Tsuki ga Kirei is just a reminder what should\u2019ve or could\u2019ve happened for all those with regrets from their younger days. Tsuki ga Kirei is everything I wanted Kuzu no Honkai to be, the characters are brimming withpersonality, the visual storytelling is off the charts, and there is more to it than just a love story. Each character has their own aspirations and there is substance to why they exist. I\u2019m glad the show takes its subject matter seriously, because there\u2019s not a lot of room for comedic relief and gags in a show trying to express how difficult young love is. Characters have insecurities and can\u2019t explain why they feel a certain way to specific people. Tsuki ga Kirei does a great job showing how young people can make relationships work without needing a reason.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, the story is basically what the synopsis is saying. However, that is just a hair of what Tsuki ga Kirei is trying to express. It goes without saying that we are going to see these characters mature, as they are in their adolescence stage. But just the cringy awkwardness of character interactions and difference in personalities depending on settings just show that the writers care a little bit more about portraying the life of adolescent teenagers taking the next step in life. Besides even showing the romance between our main characters, (which I think is its weakest link) the development each character gets leads to satisfying results. The show doesn\u2019t hold back in regards to losing out. No doubt by the end of this anime, we see characters mature and become their own person. The process of getting to that point makes Tsuki ga Kirei different from other anime in the romance drama/ coming of age anime.  \\n\\n\r\n\tThe characters are all full of life and are definitely the high point of this anime. The character interactions in this are what you\u2019d expect from middle schoolers ready to get into their na\u00efve \u201cwe will be together forever!\u201d stage. However, it\u2019s a joy seeing how characters think about other things other than this character or meaningless gossip. Of course, gossip plays a part in the story, but there isn\u2019t anything overly dramatic where it forces an interaction like for example the main guy saving the main girl from girls talking about her behind her back. What we get are characters listening to what peers say and coming to the realization that it\u2019s not a bad thing to fall in love with this certain someone. While it\u2019s really cheesy, the portrayal of these real-life scenarios is what really makes these characters shine. There ends up being a love triangle in this Tsuki ga Kirei, but instead of the really cringy \u201clet things flow\u201d that anime does, the characterization really shows through these scenes. Instead of letting it go, characters resolve themselves to see it through to the end and it just makes me feel so bad because it makes me regret seeing these young kids do what I couldn\u2019t (it also makes me feel great). Seeing every character go beyond their roles is what gave me the most enjoy watching Tsuki ga Kirei. \\n\\n\r\n\tThe visual presentation of Tsuki ga Kirei was really breathtaking sometimes. It\u2019s use of angles and scenes with no words but animation created powerful scenes. Accompanied with the music, it really brings out the mood and atmosphere of whatever scene we\u2019re watching. Of course, the animation itself isn\u2019t that great, there are instances of awful CG characters and some sloppy animating of the main characters, but all can be forgiven because the most powerful scenes were the best animated. Also, the music really brings out the charm in some of the romantic scenes. It\u2019s excellent how the animations and music mesh together and it\u2019s almost rare nowadays to see anime express themselves like this.   \\n\r\n\tI also really liked the skits at the end of the first 7-9 episodes, they were funny to watch and just that little bit of screen time makes me think of characters I would otherwise not even bat an eye to after they\u2019re off the screen. They were also just a slight, but effective addition to the overall narrative Tsuki ga Kirei is going for, so I\u2019ll accept them. \\n\\n\r\nSide Note: too bad Chinatsu was the weakest link in all this.\\n\\n\r\n\tAll in all, Tsuki ga Kirei impressed me. The setting and age of the characters leaves the anime vulnerable to pandering, but Tsuki ga Kirei went above that and elevated itself above most romance anime by taking its subject matter seriously and not making a joke of it. The empathy I got from watching these characters struggle is what lead me to believe that the writers didn\u2019t joke around when it comes to adolescent love. The satisfaction I got from watching characters talk out their problems and resolving themselves for hard decisions is what really made me like these characters. The plot also has decent substance without using that much exposition, as previously said. The directing was very good and projected the characters emotions very well. The overall package of Tsuki ga Kirei created a very enjoyable experience for me and proves to me that anime can still be expressive and creative in ways live action movies can\u2019t.\\n",

            "content": "Aah, I wish someone told me before I started watching this that it's SoL on ROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOIDS. \r\nNOTE: Before going any further, I just want to disclose that I'm not the biggest fan of SoL, especially when comedy is sparse. So just remember that this is from a perspective of someone who generally tends to avoid these types of shows. Also, I'll be diving into spoilers, as I don't think I'll be able to convey why I just couldn't stuff last 2 episodes otherwise. So, with that said, let's get this over with.\r\nStory: 1/10\r\nNow, I could write something generic here, like \"well, truly, there is nostory\" or something along the lines of \"whatever little story there is, it sucks\", but the problem with Tsuki ga Kirei runs much, much deeper when it comes to the general narrative. Not only is it pretty cliche in terms of where plot points begin, how they climax and where they end, but it is absolutely ruined by its snail-slow pace. Now, again, this is one of the reasons why I tend to dislike SoLs in the first place: lack of forthcoming narrative. I believe that all stories should have, well, a story. It doesn't have to be epic. It doesn't have to invoke thunder-like emotions. But, it has to have a story. Otherwise, it's just a string of sketches, and it has no point. And that's the problem with Tsuki ga Kirei: it has no point. \\n\\n\r\nFor an example, first 2 episodes (~40 minutes), have about 5 minutes of material in the terms of narrative. Which is why nearly every new scene has like 15 establishing shots for no reason. 5 minutes of narrative, with absolutely no comedy worth a dime, stretched to 40 minutes run time. I don't understand. What's the point? Is this supposed to convey some deeper meaning I'm missing? Is it about how life is truly mundane and how little to nothing happens in our daily lives? Perhaps. Maybe that was the intention. However, there are better ways to convey this, and stretching it to 40 minutes certainly isn't a way. Maybe there's even more to it, but I'm not seeing it. I just kept trying to fill in the blanks with my own imagination, but I don't feel like it was supposed to go that way. \\n\\n\r\nFrom episode 2 onward, this speeds up somewhat, but the whole narrative is so bare bones that nothing of true consequence happens. First and foremost, what's even the point of this story? It can't be coming of age story, as characters aren't old enough for that. It can't be relaxing romance because it's boring. It can't be comedy because it's not. It can't be melodrama because it has no drama. Is it really just 'daily lives of middle school kids who kinda like each other for some reason and decide to date'? If you ever took classes on storytelling, the very first thing you'll learn is to avoid cliches. Second is that your story generally needs to have a threefold structure: incisive beginning, cumulative climax and natural ending. Whether it's in the terms of the entire narrative or just short arcs within it, if you decide to stray from this formula, you better have dozens of years of experience when it comes to writing, or whatever you do will amount to nothing. Which is the case here.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of romance here, I don't get it. Ayame and Azuki have no chemistry. They are just awkward teens that kind of decide to date. And I mean really 'awkward' of the 'awkward' kind. They're both shy, indecisive, reclusive, silent. These couples are some of the worst to write about because they have nothing captivating about them. Who will ever say that Ayame or Azuki, as individuals, are great, or even memorable, characters? No one. This isn't the case of two terribles making something great, just enhancing their template terribleness even further. All the moments they share are stuffed to shit with silence and awkward glances. I get it. That's how teens are. However, it's not interesting. Whenever we reminiscence of teen days, we don't talk about awkward relationships where nothing of consequence happened because even we forgot about it. And that's another problem here: nothing is memorable. \\n\\n\r\nThey don't have a moment together where you go 'haaah I'll remember that for good while'. Even their 'kiss' scene is cluttered with 'artsy' foreground and background to the point that the focus of the entire scene is indiscernible. I get what the show was going for, I really do. It aimed to convey the awkward days, the innocence of youth, but there's a reason why every other show that does this adds more to it: it's because that concept can't stand on its own. Hell, even in movie form, it can't stand on its own, let alone for 12 episodes. As someone who generally hates 'drama for the sake of drama' in shows, I was PRAYING for something to happen, anything. But even when it did, the show played it so safe I wondered what the hell was the point. \\n\\n\r\nOkay, I feel like I rattled on about the story for a bit too long. I'll probably get back to it when I get to the characters, but, for the time being, let's move on.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nArt has two sides: good and bad. Whenever there are only a few characters on screen, it's pretty decent. The pointless white highlights on every character were unnecessary and distracting, but it was okay. The show does have some decent moments (my favorite scene is actually the opening scene as it pans over rather interesting architecture), and bolsters some pretty decent background work.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, it all falls apart whenever we see a group of people. CG people. It clashes with background far too much, it's amateurish, it's absolutely ugly, and even people casually watching it will notice. And, as the show loves to have 26 establishing shots for every scene, you can bet your sweet ass that those CG monstrosities will be showing up in every episode. I know it's expensive to animate such scenes, but at least put some effort into CG. If you can't handle it, don't try to go for the 'impressive' perspective to awe the viewer when details ruin the entire scene.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation, it's similar to art. It has some competent animation, especially when it comes to running/dancing, but outside of it it's pretty basic. There were several atrocious scenes when people were running outside of track, but animation is salvaged somewhat with the aforementioned background work, as I oftentimes just ignored the characters altogether and looked for details in the scenery around them. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nBy far the best part of the entire anime. Even if exclude those random 2 music videos that show up because, well, episodes gotta be 20 minutes and holy shit how else are we gonna make that happen, sound on the whole was good. Music accompanied the scenes properly and it set the mood the show was going for. To be honest, most scenes that should otherwise be completely terrible were oftentimes salvaged by the music alone. It may be just me, but I generally tend to like slow piano pieces, which this show has plenty of, so it sat with me well. Not much else to say, really.\\n\\n\r\nI'd love to comment on VA's, but I bet half their scripts read 'uh' 'ah' 'umm' 'eh', so why even bother? \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nAs is the norm with these half-assed attempts at making romance of generic teens appealing, the show focuses on the 2 least interesting characters of its entire cast. Why? Why do these shows do this? Why focus on literally the most boring aspect of your narrative? I don't know. Maybe, again, it's some metaphor that reflects our own lives, maybe it's just something I don't get because I can't relate to it, but I was far more intrigued with everything else except our leading duo. \\n\\n\r\nAzumi is defined like this: shy guy who writes.\\n\r\nAkame is defined like this: shy girl who runs. \\n\\n\r\nThere. That's the characterization. There's no depth to them and, whatever depth there appears to be, is just teen angst rearing its ugly face. They are defined by their hobbies and their base characteristic. Relationships between two shy people are AMAZING for two shy people, but they're some of the most boring relationships to look at as the third party, especially when you have to stretch it over 12 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nAgain, it may be me missing some deeper narrative, but I highly doubt it. I don't think it's me missing deeper narrative, but it's simply not a show meant for me. I get that. I'm not 14 anymore and, if I'm being frank, I hate my 14y old self. I'm pretty much full-fledged adult at this point, and these 'cutesy' 'coming of age' stories just don't do it for me anymore, especially if they're so lacking in comedy. I enjoy seeing relationships, not awkward attempts at them. I enjoy seeing characters that brim with 'character', not two stick-dolls who can barely hit 'audible' in terms of volume of their voices. I enjoy narrative with a point, not attempt at basic pandering. \\n\\n\r\nI don't understand why this show is rated so highly. I don't understand why its characters and narrative and 'message' are so praised. They're basic. Take every 'awkward couple' of every romance anime, and you have it. Honestly, I even found Kimi no Todoke less boring, and it's not like Kimi no Todoke is epitome of even passable narrative. The reason I found it less boring is because it had comedy. Its characters bounced off of each other to create the comedic narrative because it was lacking elsewhere. However, Tsuki ga Kirei doesn't have that. I think I chuckled maybe once during their interactions. Was that the point? Maybe. I'm generally not the type to say 'oh, it's fine as long as you enjoyed it', as that statement encourages more of the same. I want aggressive, challenging stories. I want characters with depth, and I want to see them tackle issues in accordance to their character. There's none of that here. \\n\\n\r\nEven though I've been shitting on our main couple, it's not like side characters are any better if I'm being honest. This mainly stems from the fact that we don't see them often enough. I don't get it, though. Pretty much every episode has at least 3-4 minutes of establishing shots, so why not just use it to give your side characters SOMETHING? Those post-credit bits aren't enough. It's like the creators realized that the story lacked that comedic narrative, and just slapped some randomly irrelevant comedic bits in the end and said 'great, let's do it like this'. \\n\\n\r\nWhen that Chizu whatever best friend asked our MG 'can I confess to your boyfriend', I was honestly looking forward to their fallout. Not because 'I choose my 1week BF over my BFF', but because that's just not something you do as BFF. But nope. Why have SOMETHING interesting happen, when we can have 83 establishing shots of pointless scenes instead? \\n\\n\r\nTsuki ga Kirei is jam packed with nothing. It's a string of mundane events that offer no depth. It's an attempt at 'ordinary coming of age story' that fails to understand that ordinary doesn't equal boring and uninteresting. I spent most of my summer vacation at home, and I had way more fun than any of these characters. And that's just fucking sad. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nI didn't enjoy the show, far from it, but I'd lie if I said there isn't any merit to it. Young people nowadays lack shows like this, and I appreciate that about the show. Doesn't mean I excuse all its shortcomings, but still, it's something. It's a show that tells young people that it's okay to be boring and ordinary. And, even if I disagree with that, I can see its point. At least it's better than your generic harem and echii crap, so if you're gonna watch something, at least watch this over that. \\n\\n\r\nI don't know how the show ends. I'll probably never find out. I've been skipping scenes since episode 4, and stuffing through 40 more minutes is just not something I can do (well, 50 more minutes, as I just quit halfway through ep. 10). Whether it ends in a happy, sad or bittersweet fashion, I don't care because I don't care for the main characters. Whether their dreams come true or not, I don't care. They're 14. What the fuck are they thinking is going to happen? I don't know. \\n\\n\r\nThat pretty much summarizes my 'thoughts about the show': I don't know. I don't know whether there's some deeper narrative that I'm missing because I'm not the target audience (both in terms of the genres and in terms of the characters). I don't know if there's deeper meaning to the show's lack of any form of narrative. I don't know whether CG people are supposed to represent how our society is robotic, or whether it's just cheaper to make it that way. I don't know whether I'm dead inside, or it's just the show. I just... don't know.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nWhichever it may be, I know this isn't a show I'd recommend to anyone. Perhaps, if I was 14, I might have enjoyed the show more. But, I doubt it. I was very much different when I was 14 than our main duo, or even any other side character present here. It may be just me, and the show is truly a masterpiece that I'll never get, but at least from the technical standpoint of the writing, the show is not good. It has terrible pace. It lacks proper narrative. It uses bare bone foreshadowing (ep. 3 oh, we might be moving to Chiba = it's gonna be a major plot point for the couple later on. Whoever missed this... eh, whatever), it's stuffed with nothing, it doesn't have decently written characters, and myriad of other things that I'm probably forgetting, because I'm already forgetting the show itself. I don't think it's as bad as, say, Your Lie in April, but it's definitely far more boring than it. \\n\\n\r\nThat's really all I wanted to say. Maybe I'm truly turning into an old man... I just... don't know.",

            "content": "Are you Interested in a change of pace? Want something out of the norm? Something that's different from previous romance titles but still leaves a large impact on the viewer. If so then I would highly suggest watching something else. I went into this anime hoping that it would progress in a manner I am not used to but it failed to impress let alone entertain me for the majority of the season. Typical intro where the main character meets a girl who he doesn't know and for whatever reason they're instantly drawn to each other. A clich\u00e9d intro like this had me feeling asif I was going to be watching another typical shoujo anime. And boy was I right. That's not to say that the anime is horrendous, the art style is interesting and the sound is fair. The characters however, did not leave much of an impact on me at all. I felt as though I was actually watching supporting characters rather than regular characters in a story(if that makes any sense). It feels as though the characters were there because they needed to be not necessarily because they were meant to or because they fit in well. This review comes from someone who watches romance anime more often than any other genre and the rating this anime has still continues to baffle me in comparison to some of my more favorable titles. I do have to give the creators some credit because they did manage to construct a pretty eventful story in only 12 episodes without it feeling rushed, the story itself however, could've used some polishing. Check it out though, you might disagree.",

            "content": "\"It's not being in love that makes me happy. It is the person that i am in love with that does\"\r\nStory of romance sometimes are pretty generic. We see a boy and a girl fallin in love with each other then they meet some obstacle in their relationship but somehow can manage it and happy end. But of course, the differences is how they would wrap that generic story and for me, Tsuki ga Kirei have take to a whole new level of it.\r\nBrought to you by the director of famous anime, Angel Beats. The story is pretty much generic but what makes Tsuki gaKirei interesting is how they deliver the story. When we see the first second of the anime, one things that would come to our mind is 'relatable' like have you ever fallin in love with someone without any reason? and doesnt have much courage to talk with them so u just can look at him/her in a distance? for some people, they can relate this kind of romance story when they were in Junior High School like you are shy to hold your partner's hand or doesnt have any courage to talk with your crush or partner in the school. For me, i can relate to all that stuff so i can feel what the main characters feels in each scenes.\\n\\n\r\nAlong with it, there is kind of a refreshment to see how the romance develop between each characters. Because your main characters (Azumi Kotarou) isnt some of playboy with outgoing personality but a timid-literature-nerd boy who just experiencing the first love of his life and the same case for the heroine (Mizuno Akane), she is an active girl but when it comes to love she becomes timid. How they will make their relationship become much better is one of things that makes this anime interesting to see more.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the story progress is quite slow and maybe it will bore some people but this kind of approach is suitable for romance series anime because we will see much detail about their story or background and it can increase the tense that happen in some scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this anime is perfectly suit with the pure romance themes. The watercolour pallete they use are deepening the mellow atmosphere and really suitable with story. The background also pleasing to see like it's kind of Makoto Shinkai works but instead using sharp colour they're using subtle and watercolour pallete. Though not many people get used with this kind of art.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, i found this anime is enjoyable to watch and so far is still interesting to see what happens next. This anime maybe would be a hidden gem in this season if they still continuing with kind of pace and have a kind of twist in the end.",

            "content": "[7.5/10]\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\nBehold first love. A first kiss. A tender touch. Without it, we would cease to grow. A metaphoric stomping on roots. Painted through cliche, breathing through understatements. Each veteran, wandering eye gazing down at innocence and wishing to relive moments missed. Missed through longing or melancholy. A bittersweet visage of young love remarked dismissively by jaded tongues. If only my own wasn't so jaded.\r\nThese moments, mandatory, yet romanticized. It's in the genre, after all. Yet that's so often the failure. Perfection is wanted, but only through shallow wishes. Wanting perfection in a relationship is like wanting world peace. An empty claim that flirts with ignorancemore so than profundity. It's hollow, and maybe that's the point. The more hollow something is, the easier we can attach and fill that shell with our own viscous desire for something which we unconsciously know will never be experienced. It's a fleeting world of returned passion and beleaguered, yet gleaming puppy love.\\n\\n\r\nThat's the world which Azumi and Mizuno inhabit. Two last-year middle schoolers swept up by one another's awkward glances and burning blushes. Where handholding is first base and meeting lips may as well warrant contraceptive. Where their world veers right where many anime tend to drive forward is in the presentation of the setting. Where romance anime often pulls back on verisimilitude to create melodrama, Tsuki Ga Kirei attempts to create a bond through experience. Walking along an empty street, something as innocuous as eating lunch with one another, yet painted with a thick enough brush to be seen as romance. \\n\\n\r\nThese scenes border on Iyashekei, as they hold no value to anyone who doesn't want to spend time with these characters. In those moments, the moments in which we look to a budding relationship, not through admittance or confession, but through the experience of human emotion, are the series at its peak. Its ability to let these characters and their stories breath in a short twelve-episode runtime shines brightest once the final credits roll. While not devoid of melodrama, as the all-consuming love-triangle looms heavy over this lovable romp, it is dealt with so relaxed, with such an incredibly small pool of tears, that it ceases to even feel as abrasive as it actually may be. \\n\\n\r\nIf action anime can often be conflated with B-movies, shlock entertainment, and pulp, then romance anime would fall under the equally divisive umbrella of soap opera and cable-access drama. Something that generally feels vapid and empty, banking more on the attractiveness of the leads than the narrative or characters. This approach may be assumptive and, to a certain extent, overly amalgamating an entire medium and genre into one pigeonholed view, it does, however, hold some truth to it. This may be based on the small pool I've consumed, but these elements within anime are so abundantly clear to anyone who's watched an expansive amount of any kind of entertainment, that I feel like it is difficult to argue against.\\n\\n\r\nWith that notion established, you are left to your own devices. They must be used to determine whether or not this kind of entertainment truly appeals to you. Do you revel in the shlock? The pulp? The medium which can easily become trite and redundant if you look just past the surface? Or will your critical lens prevent you from doing that?  Perhaps the answer is more complicated. Taste, after all, is multi-faceted and you can appreciate many different forms of entertainment, different genres and even subgenres presented in unique ways. I, like many others, have exactly that outlook on my own taste.\\n\\n\r\nFor example, action anime rarely does anything for me. I have a very specific outlook and belief in the way I understand and enjoy action sequences. Whether it be the nail-biting thrill of a bank-robbery to the fist-clapping bravado in an action spectacle like Pacific Rim or Fury Road. There's an exact understanding of what makes my dopamine rush and unfortunately, that \"something\" isn't prevalent in the action anime I consume. The over-the-top nature of so many series' that I watch quickly becomes a bore when I'm regularly forced to witness such below-average presentation.\\n\\n\r\nThe same can be said about romance. A genre which I'm most critical of simply by being something which I harbor little interest in. The outcomes fostered by generic romance writing are continuously so banal that the entire genre has fallen into a kind of malaise which I'm not even attempting to break free from. This malaise, of course, is my own mea culpa. Now that's not to say romance can't be done well. However, add anime's tendency to focus on abrasive melodrama and over-the-top cloying emotionality and my interest in the genre is borderline non-existent. \\n\\n\r\nThus Tsuki Ga Kerei decided to seemingly be the antithesis of what I've come to expect from romance anime. While the usual, outlined elements are there. Specifically, the too-good-to-be-true moments which romance enjoys basking in. There is a very distinct approach to go against the grain in a surprisingly effective way. The focus on experience over melodrama does so much to establish characters which would otherwise have little to no personality to actually connect with. It's so refreshing to see an anime where I can't pinpoint the otaku-driven character archetypes. \\n\\n\r\nParents, not only being present but being major players within a romance? An emphasis on legitimate, non-sexual awkwardness? It would seem as though this series traveled through the nether. From a dimension similar to ours but where romance anime actually gets a chance to explore non-market-demanded characters in situations that aren't simply made to pluck at whatever heartstrings aren't calloused over from the suffocating saccharine nature of this genre, and, to a certain extent, the medium.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, Tsuki Ga Kirei can't escape every cliche that one would associate with the medium. The series' biggest fault is its production. It doesn't look good. The shots are often flatter than intended and even some of the better framed moments that clearly had care put into them are unfortunately marred by low production values. There is no need to even mention the horrific CG crowds which seem to have become a common staple of rushed anime. I still have to give Studio Feel. credit for focusing on some genuinely impressive character animation, at times, that gave a lot of needed exposition about some hobbies our protagonists may have. For example, our lead Azumi is clearly a fan of boxing. We see that not only from his poster above his bed but also how he treats a hanging lamp-switch like a boxing bag. Yet this isn't ever mentioned through dialogue.\\n\\n\r\nThere is still a reliance on some cloying and cliche elements here and there, and it stands out all the more when the rest of the series is oriented around a more relaxed and realistic approach to the romance. Some moments tend to drag when the focus is on spurned love, particularly in the side characters which form the love rectangle which the middle-half of the series does well to not shine an obnoxious amount of light on. Even the frustrating monologuing which so much romance anime seems to heavily indulge in is included, yet not to an extreme and the pseudo-philosophical comments on love by a character who is in middle-school are well-explained by his fascination with reading. The majority of Azumi's monologued quotes come from the beautiful pen of Osamu Dazai. \\n\\n\r\nThe resolution feels right, without feeling wholly realistic. To return back to the initial thesis about romance anime, the prevailing feeling of \"fakeness\" is still present. The situations here, while given a more satisfyingly realistic platform to bounce off of, are still not \"real\" enough to be truly relatable to anyone who isn't living the perfect life of a kid. Perhaps that is something which I will never see eye-to-eye with in this genre. These kids, each one having problems, from a struggling passion for writing which unfortunately goes a bit unexplored, to a lingering attraction to the freedom of competitive field and track.  These problems are genuinely resolved painlessly, though. While there are thankfully realistically bittersweet moments within the series, they are often back-ended by a reassuring touch from the hands of the writer, nudging you to believe that everything is still perfect.\\n\\n\r\nBehold first love, as eyes meet from across a barren dancefloor. A first kiss, in the girl's bathroom, followed by a timid apology. A tender touch, which leads to immediate recoil and guilt. Without it, I would've ceased to grow. A metaphoric stomping on my own roots. Painted through reality, breathing through experience. Each veteran, wandering eye gazing down at the loss of innocence and wishing to relive moments missed. Missed through longing or melancholy. A bittersweet visage of young love remarked dismissively by jaded tongues. Maybe that's just me, though. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Romance is a genre that has been done to death in anime. Some try to liven things up by going for a romance-comedy approach that often falls short of balancing between the two. Some try to go for moody serious drama that sometimes take itself too seriously by sprinkling dark elements into the mix resulting into a mess. Whatever various scenarios these shows present, what they all have in common is that they have always strive to show something interesting to its viewers beyond the romance, which can result to negligence of the potential development from it. \r\nIt has always bothered me, as a personwho has encountered a lot of romance fiction, that stories revolving between two pairings are often beaten around the bush up until the very end. Not that it's automatically considered a bad thing since I wouldn\u2019t mind it if there was a sense of progression in terms of character development, but the potential of a love in bloom is often ignored and then the story tries to come back to it with a very rushed resolution that can leave an unsatisfying taste. Of course, I\u2019m talking about shows that don\u2019t have romance as the only thing going for it since one that is purely about romance is a rarity. But what if there comes a show that puts all of its strengths on romance alone? This is where Tsuki ga Kirei shines through as a simple yet memorable tale of young love.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that makes this show stand out is that the romantic relationship is established midway and the rest of the episodes detail their life as a couple. Even though we had shows like Lovely Complex and Ore Monogatari in the past, Tsuki ga Kirei beats them in terms of subtleness and intimacy. It wants to be mature despite the dullness it can accumulate from stripping away so many elements that make up a typical modern school romance. It wants to show the naivety and stubbornness that first love brings and how it basically screams the laid-back yet youthful lifestyle that most of the older viewers can relate to. \\n\\n\r\nAside from the various skits presented at the end of most episodes, there is no actual comedy to be found in the show. It still maintains to be lighthearted despite that, as it never fails to leave a warm fuzzy feeling within. The chemistry between Azumi and Akane is beautiful, they are two socially awkward teenagers and it\u2019s such a delight to see the two of them dealing with their feelings. Whenever they interact, their speech is limited but their facial expressions and body language brings up the message even clearer. There might be the occasional clich\u00e9 moment here and there, but their generated reactions to such cases feel sincere enough to be not seemingly forced.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the show brings its romance to the forefront, it still manages to provide glimpses of things outside of it. Azumi is an aspiring writer and Akane is a track-and-field member and the story details their struggles of compensating between priorities. If only the show was extended for another cour, it would be nice to see the story expound on this. It is a shortcoming that I admit prevents me from giving this show a greater score, but I still think it still sufficiently manages to explore that aspect of the story well enough.\\n\\n\r\nOn the more technical side of things, the animation is quite average. It can be mediocre at times, especially when crowds of CGI people are often used in the background. However, it gives more emphasis on individual movement towards relevant characters in the scene. One certain scene that stuck out the most is the one where Azumi is doing the festival dance with such eccentric animation but weirdly hypnotizing with its frequent thrusts and fluid maneuvers. The character design is quite good, nothing flashy but it\u2019s pretty simple. The soundtrack is amazing and it helps set the mood and elevate emotional buildup at certain scenes. I can\u2019t imagine the show without its piano-driven OST to be honest, as the show would\u2019ve been too dull for my liking without it. \\n\\n\r\nFor a show that is about love, it might\u2019ve been too optimistic. There were attempts to complicate the romance with a third party, but it got resolved swiftly. School matters were also used as a deciding factor for the couple\u2019s relationship, but they still remained victorious in the end. It has its highs and lows and the story went ahead for a positive fulfilling conclusion. It might be too plain and basic for other people, but it feels very genuine enough to work as a compelling school romance. It might\u2019ve been paced too slowly for anything interesting to happen every minute, but it\u2019s that careful approach towards romance that creates a feeling of emotional tension.  Maybe a straightforward story about love and its dealings like Tsuki ga Kirei can possibly save and revitalize the romance genre, that keeping things simple can be effective as long as it has a sense of direction leading to a realization that brings a profound emotional impact. Who knows, but I have still hope that romances like this will continue to exist in the future.\\n",

            "content": "In an era where people continously gush about Serial Experiments Lain for being one of the most mind-boggling shows to ever come out of Japan, in an era where people all over the world jump from excitement when they see a new fight in Boku No Hero Academia, in era where people consider Rem from Re:Zero to be their ideal waifu, there's something that I always felt was left underappreciated. That thing was simplicity.\r\nSome look at simple shows and say that they're not making their minds busy, some say that they're not worth their time when so many excellent, fantastical adventures await, but for onceI want to give credit to a wonderful, amazing piece of animation that just followed every single step of how to create a great anime, and it did so to with the understanding of each of those elements and with the passion for a project that isn't as exciting as some would like.\\n\r\nTsuki Ga Kirei is a show that could only be created through anime, as it is absolutely boring on paper and wouldn't sell anywhere else. With that in mind, it almost seems as if the people who created it wanted to prove to themselves and to the audience that simplicity can be an advantage. With pretty much every possible part of this series being handled with care and ingenuity, it shines much brighter than most anime with an original or a fantastical plot.\\n\\n\r\n*A few spoilers included*\\n\\n\r\nTsuki Ga Kirei doesn't only tell a story, it SHOWS you a story. This is something that can usually be swept under the rug, but here the visuals are much more important the the written word. With a simple premise of \"boy meets girl, he likes to write, she likes to run\" creating melodrama and simple arcs wouldn't be enough. So the director decided that he will just tell you everything, and I mean every single thing, through visuals alone. As an original work, this was possible more than with most other series that are just adaptations of writtern word. Now, don't get me wrong, people speak, there are dialogues, monologues, everything of the sorts, it's just that most of the exposition for the world and the characters is done either through quick, short versions of those things, or entirely through the visuals and music.\\n\r\nThe perfect example for this would be one of the little quirks of the main character Azumi. In his room, there's a a light on his ceiling with a little cord to turn it on and off. Azumi tends to punch it, but does so differently depending on his emotional state. He either does almost proffesional-like hooks when he's full of determination, playful jabs when he's in a happy mood, or throws in punches full of power whenever he's angry. This is only one of many examples of character presentation through the visuals, others include things like portrayals of happiness through uncontrollable random movement, lots of facial gestures during conversations, different body movement while being with different people, more energetic when with friends and more reserved when being with your loved ones, slowly devloping those into more expressive ones as the relationship goes on.\\n\\n\r\nThat's not the only thing however. Another one that I want to point towards is the quick shots that express a lot about characters, without the viewer even realizing it. As such, in one of the episodes, when Azumi enters his home we see his father polishing a gun, a hunting gun to be more precise. This immediately adds personality to a character that overall has very little screen time. You know he acts like a living being, by that I mean he has interests and does things on his own free time. In the same scene, in the background we see Azumi's mother washing dishes, we actually see her cleaning in different ways and caring for the home a lot. This allows us to safely assume that it's her daily work, that this is what she does for most of her time. So we can already create a pretty clear imagine of a daily life of that family, through those two or three shots alone.\\n\r\nThis also happens often with the designs, like the interior designs for example. Remember when I mentioned Azumi punching a cord? Well, it still could be weird seeing him doing this one thing out of nowhere, but if you look closely, you can se a Muhammad Ali poster next to his bed. Turns out, he's into boxing, his quirk relates to something else other than just being random.\\n\r\nThere's also minor things like the differences between his and his girlfriend's - Akane's - houses and rooms. Akane sleeps in the same room as her sister, but even then her side is extremely clean, even while studying, there are shelves full of cute things and bright colors all around. Azumi's room is more messy, but it's also darker. You can get a lot of information based on ones room they say, and here it's definitely true. You can come to many conclusions about both characters based on their rooms alone, such as \"Akane likes girly things\", \"Akane has to have everything in the right place\", \"Azumi is messy\" or \"Azumi prefers to be left alone\". All of those are true. Akane has her little pink squishy toy that helps her relieve stress, but she gets really confused whenever she loses it. Azumi's hair earned him a nickname \"Curly-kun\" for how messy they are, and when he studies his notes are all over the place, he also is in a little conflict with his mother because they disagree on what path he should take in the future, thus he prefers to be left alone in his house. It all clicks, doesn't it?\\n\\n\r\nAnd don't even get me started on the wonderul directing. Seiji Kishi, you clever bastard! I have an entire list of all the scenes that I've found to be incredible, but I'm only going to bring up a few to prove my point.\\n\\n\r\n1. First one comes from episode 7, where Azumi was searching for Akane in an amusement park. This consists of a few shots, the trick is, we see Azumi moving, but every time the background changes, he is in the same place on the screen. It symbolizes how despite him searching, he's pretty much in the same place, and while the director could've shown multiple angles, the transitions feel magical and special when he does them this way, not to mention that they are less tiring to look at and don't require to draw more with an already limited budget.\\n\\n\r\n2. Second comes from two episodes, episode 6 and 9. In those episodes, we see two of the last track meetings for the school club that Akane goes to. In episode 6, there's a lot of conflicting feelings inside her, mostly because she has to choose her boyfriend between Azumi and her track club leader Kira. This uncertainty is reflected mostly through three things: facial expressions, character positioning and lighting. Of course it is obvious that she looks troubled, but she does moreso when she realizes that her close friend Chinatsu also has a crush on Azumi. When they both walk into the arena, Chinatsu stops in the part where she's lit up by the sun, and stops Akane to tell her this when she's in the dark. The next shot we see them both, Chinatsu is practicing her running start while Akane is doing practically nothing, once again, in the shadows. Next thing we see is them preparing to start on their respective blocks, Akane breaths in and the voices of the crowd start to become quiet. The race starts and the last thing we see is Chinatsu passing Akane. As we learn later, she lost. Sulking in her defeat she sits on the stairs, once again, in the shadow as her track team leader approaches her from the right side (which is lit up of course) with an angry expression. During their conversation we slowly see how Akane's face changes into extreme despair and how Kira becomes more troubled when he notices. In episode 9 we get to see the club's last track meeting, but this time it's after Azumi and Akane confessed and have been going out for some time, leaving both Chinatsu and Kira filled with regret. This time around, Akane is in the sun for most of the shots, while Chinatsu is the one that's in the shadow. This already indicates that it's going to be a good run for Akane, and it is, in fact it's her record time! Through little subtleties this show creates an atmosphere and allows the viewer's subconsciousness to provide him with expectations. Remember, you may not notice it, but your brain always does.\\n\\n\r\n3. And as the last one I want to bring up Chinatsu's point of view after she gets rejected (well, technically doesn't confess, but she sees Azumi announce their relationship for the first time). Two scenes especially come to my mind when I think about it. One of those is when Akane drives home on a train and gets a message from Chinatsu saying \"I couldn't confess\", and the already sad and melancholic music becomes slower and more distorted, the last thin we hear is a warning sound for a closing gate... I don't have to explain that, do I? Another one happens in episode 9, as we see Azumi leaving the track meeting, Chinatsu notices him as he's exiting, but through the whole time she sees him through the bars on the gate or behind a bush, this of course symbolizes how he's too far from her reach.\\n\\n\r\nI hope that at this point you can get a good grasp on what this shows' directing visual-wise. There are many, many other shots like this, countless directing tricks that I didn't bring up here that you can find on your own. Perhaps this is what made this series so fun and exciting for me despite it being a rather slow burn. Characterization and exploration through such technical stuff is something that I'll probably never get enough of.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, it's important to bring up that there are things make the presentation overall seem less impressive. Obviously, the time limits and such led to quite a few CGI crowd models. What's even worse is that they do end up dropping the frames in several scenes. Don't let that discourage you though! This show is much better visually than just that.\\n\\n\r\nTsuki Ga Kirei knows not only how to show using visuals, but also how to tell using music. I can't quite describe how well the tracks complement the scenes, as I think this is for each person to judge separately in this case, but I want to bring attention to the moments where the show pretty much turns into a music video. There are places where everything goes silent and the only thing you hear, is a song. It's used so that showcasing even more mundane things than usual doesn't feel as mundane, instead it feels magical, captivating, it's almost as if the characters do those things with some sort of grace that none of us see on a daily basis, despite doing the same things. This is another reason why I think this series wants to put simplicity on a pedestal of glory for everyone to witness. It almost glorifies normality.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot itself does suffer a tad bit from being so normal though. Despite the excitement that spotting small details brings, watching this show just for the plot can leave the viewer a bit bored, with all the exposition shots and longer scenes included. There's this aura of awkwardness everywhere the two characters go, it fits the social ineptitude quite well but can prove to be tiring.\\n\r\nAkane and Azumi are both introverts, despite having friends and laughing with them, they aren't as expressive and don't have the same presence as someone like Roman or Chinatsu have in their respective friend circles and both prefer to keep their private life to themselves. As such, the show relies heavily on their own awkwardness, cute scenes that happen when they interact, their small quirks and speech patterns. As they start to date, all of that changes into normality and finally into boundless love. It's a very natural progression that sells the image of the series as a show about adolescence and romantic feelings during that time. It asks questions like \"should you truly commit to your first love\" and \"how much should you trust your partner\". Most of the time, it ends on a positive note, because Akane and Azumi fit each other very well, they're able to overcome their hardships through each other's advice and simple, often short talks. Knowing that there's someone always waiting to listen to them, caring for their achievements and their losses and simply someone who loves them. Their relationship also allows them to notice what other people mean for them, Akane start to distance herself from her friends a bit when she notices that some almost treat her like just another gossip material, Azumi notices that his mother really cares for him despite his shortcomings, even if she treats him like a child at times. Their relationship keeps blossoming, and even with bumps along the way they keep getting stronger with it, no matter what others say. Each event does impact both of them in a way, they're just getting more comfortable with themselves and the people they're around. Simply put: They're growing up, leaving people who keep playing children with their silly relationships behind. Their love is pure, meaningful and precious and they both believe in it.\\n\\n\r\nAnother very interesting take that this show has, is it's view on romance in modern society. Akane and Azumi at first communicate mostly though LINE, which is pretty much their version of Facebook Messenger. They smile when they see new messages, get all excited because nobody can see them, send each other cute and funny stickers. It's not only charming, but shows how that the internet can be a place, where people who typically aren't communicative speak freely and do whatever they want in the meantime, keep being awkward while also socializing. Not only that, but at no point does it feel like it's trying too hard to appeal to the teen audience with it, it really seems like people who worked on this show write like this on an everyday basis. It never boils down to just pandering to a certain audience. I find this approach very charming. It's something that hasn't been explored too much, which, when I think about it, is pretty weird with all the anime about teenagers coming out each season. Well, at the same time, not many of those have characters as socially awkward as those two dorks.\\n\\n\r\nThat's really all there needs to be said about Tsuki Ga Kirei. It's an easy to understand show, but one that's very hard to comprehend the beauty of. It is simple, it embraces being simple, but it knows how to compensate for that on so many levels. It's like a reflection of the moon on a small pond, but if you lift your head you may be able to see the true image of it on the night's sky, start noticing the stars around it that compliment it and make it even more amazing than it already is. So As the Moon, So Beautiful lights up the dark anime sky with it's imagination, I am finally able to see how wonderful can it truly be when you just put the effort into making something. I won't be forgetting this image for a long while.\\n\\n\r\nAs always, this is purely my opinion. I highly encourage you to develop your own.",

It's not an anime that has amazing episodes, actually they can even get a bit boring at some point (specially if you're not used to \"paused\" animes) but what makes this anime so good is the whole of it, it's actually quite realistic about how current teenagers have relationships(with the typical japanes touch, of course) and the art is good, even though sometimes the CGI was horrible, the musicfits perfectly and most importantly the MC is not the typical pu**y, he's in fact normal not a badass nor a pu**y.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is not for everyone but if you like to cry and feel feelings(xd) when you watch anime this is your show",

            "content": "[Middle-School Romance]\r\nAnime shows entailing romance, adolescence, and school-life are nothing new; many follow common themes, employ cliche characters, and have hackney narratives.  And, while, this show may share similar themes, its characters and narrative go beyond simple cliches.  They add hints of realism and truth, recreating events people could relate and reminisce about.  Tsuki ga Kirei may not subvert the romance genre, but its stellar technical production, realistic narrative and charming characters are both refreshing and remarkable.\r\nSTORY:\r\nThe show features a simple storyline summarized as: boy meet girl, boy falls in love with girl, boy dates girl, boy and girl stay together foreverand live happily ever after.  Its themes are also simple, revolving around youth and innocences, first love, the trials of love, and overcoming challenges.  While, its themes and storyline aren\u2019t original, its execution, and how it handles familiar themes and plot points, such as love triangles, confessions, dates, and arguments, are outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nThe setting is middle school, where our main characters are anxious, immature, and still developing.  Scenes of social awkwardness, insecurity, and fidgeting are common occurrences and, yet, scenes of confidences, determination, and acceptance occur just as often.  All of these moments add to the realism.  Speaking of realism, don\u2019t expect outrageous situations, forced drama, or random twists to interfere with the narrative.  What you can expect is a down-to-earth story with its main conflicts rooted in everyday life like dealing with first love, how and when to confess your love, how to handle awkward silence, and many more.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the pacing for this show may appear slow, however it isn\u2019t.  On the contrary, the pacing is consistent and even, each episode allows enough room for both character and plot development without any additional fillers or distractions.  Furthermore, there are no expositions; only meaningful character interactions, visual cues, and dramatic silence moments.  And, at the end, of certain episodes, are short scenes, focusing on other characters\u2019 relationships.  These scenes are cute, funny, and relatable.  Overall, the narrative is amazing and realistic.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION:\\n\\n\r\nUsing watercolor palette is an unusual art style, but one that is appropriate for this anime.  Warm light colors, like blue, pink, red, and yellow, fill the screen, cueing viewers that the tone is lighthearted and the ambience pleasant.  The lighting, while slightly bright in certain scenes, also play an important role in maintaining the tone and ambience.  The background animation features many fine details, from moving, talking crowds to tiny water droplets, that enrich the world the characters live in.  The character models are well designed, sensible, and distinctive, bringing to life the personalities and appearances of young children in their youth.  And finally, the consistent animation, accompanied with great camera angles, allow significant moments between characters to be played out.  All of these points aid in highlghting the narrative\u2019s themes and the characters\u2019 personalities.  Overall, I love the show's style of art.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, there are two minors issues, first, CGI background characters are low-detail and lousy, and second, a few animations appear choppy.  Other than those two issues, everything else concerning art and animation is perfect.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\\n\r\nLike its art and animation, the sound design, itself, is important in maintaining a certain mood and atmosphere.  For example, the opening song has fast tempos, conveying excitement and happiness, while the ending song has slow tempos, conveying serenity.  Still, both these songs are your standard J-Pop, and not as noteworthy as the voice acting, insert songs, and background sounds.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is notable for its faithful depiction of a shy middle-schooler.  You will hear sighs, mumbles and grunts, and whispers and, while this may annoy and distract some viewers, it adds to the dialogue some realism.  More importantly is how the voice actors are able to convey many emotions without being overly dramatic.  The insert songs include varies piano or orchestral pieces, which are calm and relaxing.  The background sounds, like its background art, possesses many tiny details, such as the chatter of people, the sound of falling rain, birds chirping, etc, make the show feel alive.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\\n\r\nOur main characters, Akane and Kotarou, are both charming and compelling, and are the crux of this show.  The remaining cast are there either to influence them, or 'to be influenced\u2019.  Now, there\u2019s no denying that our main leads have more screen time, thus having the most character development, while our remaining cast appear infrequently, thus having the least character development.  Still, their appearances provide some insight into their personalities, many human exchanges and reactions, and the occasional plot advancement.  They are, for the most part, an excellent supporting cast.\\n\\n\r\nAkane and Kotarou possess complex and distinctive personalities with pragmatic ambitions.  Akane is in the track and field club, and hopes to continue her passion for running in college.  She is easygoing, studious, and prone to \u2018anxiety\u2019, sneezing her potato sack to relax herself, and yet has a sociable demeanor.  Kotarou is in the literature club, and hopes to becomes a novelist.  He is carefree, composed, and likes to spout serious poetic line, yet acts silly when using LINE or when he\u2019s pretending to box his lamp cord.  \\n\\n\r\nThe character development for Akane and Kotarou is very noticeable.  In the beginning, Kotarou was very reserved and shy, only speaking to his male friends.  However, once Akane entered his life, he became more outgoing and confident.  Some scenes that demonstrate his confidence include his confession, his attempts to hold Akane\u2019s hand and asking her out on a date, and much more.  The same could seen in Akane, such as when she asked for Kotarou\u2019s number, or brought a birthday present for him.  Overall, the main characters are great, and posses a surprising amount of personality and development.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: \\n\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed this anime from its interesting characters to its realistic narrative.  It managed to make me smile, tug at my heart, and overall, turned my bad days into good ones.  I recommend everyone to watch this show.",

            "content": "Life changing is how \u201cin-love\u201d feels in adolescence because it is a far more moving and compelling relationship than the young people have known before. The experience is all consuming and each is always on the other\u2019s mind. It is a merged relationship and each one feels part of the other, not quite whole when they are not together, especially when it comes to your first experience being in love. Tsuki ga Kirei (The Moon is Beautiful) is a touching romance tale that explores the many facets of love and strives to exemplify the beauty in simplicity while conveying both adolescence and realism. What makesthis show refreshing in this saturated genre is that it encapsulates a different kind of \u2018love\u2019 rarely seen, while awkwardly presented, it\u2019s taken the subject seriously\u2014the love that is kind and patient, that does not envy or boast, that bears all things, believes all things and endures all things. Warning, spoilers ahead!\\n\\n\r\nThe story follows our main protagonists, a young boy named Kotarou Azumi who is an inspiring writer and a young girl in Akane Mizuno, who is athletically gifted in Track events (running). The two find themselves worrying about their last year of middle school since the future remains unknown. When they find each other, however, they discover a whole new world that changes their lives for the better. Tsuki ga Kirei has a great finesse of visual storytelling\u2014it prioritizes displaying emotion over actually explaining it. This approach focuses more on the small precious moments, something as a simple as a smile, small gestures and thoughtful exchanges rather than big emotional melodramatic scenes, it\u2019s a realistic depiction of a first love relationship. Moments like Kotarou had to search the internet on what people do when they\u2019re dating, Akane making Kotarou a hand-knitted scarf, finding ways to spend more time alone together, or thinking about how to continue their relationship after middle-school\u2014it feels genuine, it feels real and progresses naturally throughout the story between the lovers since it more or less provides a powerful romance story from beginning to end.\\n\\n\r\nKotarou and Akane are two sides of the same coin. Kotarou lacks the self-esteem he needs to be more socially confident. Akane squeezes her plushie to calm her nerves whenever she's in a tense situation. Both keep to themselves and are generally quiet and polite people in their day-to-day activities. Most impressive to me is the phone messages sent between Kotarou and Akane. While struggling to talk to each other face-to-face at times, their interactions on their social media app (LINE) were completely different. These conversations were generally filled with confidence and energy. It didn't mean their shyness disappeared completely, it was blatantly obvious by their facial expressions and actions that the messages were often hard to send and waiting for a reply seemed agonising. Both of them would always be happy and excited whenever they got a response. Its such a joy to see their conversations online appeared to be very authentic and relatable. This is where Tsuki ga Kirei pulls an unexpected victory through its writing that moves the characters forward through realistic yet limited conversational dialogue. The show really knows how to make use of silence and stillness yet still captures the natural dialogue and emotion of teenagers amid family and friends. \\n\\n\r\nTsuki ga Kirei puts the young couple on a path for purposeful growth over the course of this touching romance tale. Part of their growth comes from a maturing of the adolescence they experience, failing within their respective goals and lastly, the influence and support from family and friends. Not only does this growth persists throughout the duration of the show but is also very significant since it adds towards the tones of realism. Akane and Kotarou are two teens who have reached a period in their lives where they are transitioning from young kids to young adults, and the director in Seijei Kishi understands that there isn\u2019t a need for anything complex or crazy for them to develop as characters, but rather these simple catalysts and each other. Their mutual love gives each other the motivation they need to succeed\u2014a classic example comes from their interactions together. Generally, they say very little out in public but they are so much more open when they are together in private and are able to hold much longer conversations with each other. When they show they're willing to fully express themselves to each other, it signals the positive essence of their love and relationship. As they slowly start to venture outside of their comfort zones, they're able to express their love more physically through holding hands, hugging and eventually kissing. \\n\\n\r\nAltogether, Kotarou and Akane\u2019s actions prove to be rewarding\u2014sincere love changes people for the better. Despite the trials and tribulations along the way, they overcome their self-esteem and anxiety issues because they walked through it together. Not only have they personally grown as individuals but their relationship has had an effective impact affecting them in a positive manner. One memorable challenge the couple had to face was having friends falling for them, in Takumi Hira and Nishio Chinatsu respectively. It makes sense as to why Takumi, (on the track team) naturally begins to admire Akane after years on the team, while Nishio\u2019s (also on the track team) consistent interactions with Kotarou and his bedhead change her thoughts on him completely. The eventual heartbreak for Takumi and Nishio is very tough and can hit home for a lot of viewers, but how it was handled was great. Most anime generally has the character who lost out feel unauthentic but Tsuki ga Kirei handles it proficiently well, and showing the repercussions as the anime went on was a nice touch, and only refers back to how realism is woven into every fabric of the story. Although they aren\u2019t developed much, they clearly belong to this universe.\\n\\n\r\nReally interesting to see that this is studio Feel\u2019s first original anime, and coming up with original titles, especially when it comes to romance, is really risky. Was it successful? It sure is! But when it comes to the art and animation, while great for the most part, there are a few hiccups here and there. Firstly, studio Feel goes for a more standard (but done well) designs for their characters, more in the same way that Mushishi does to give it more of an element of realism with only a few characters having distinctive anime troupe designs. Visually pretty with its well-detailed backgrounds and a more of a light and warm colour palette to give off a more, gentle appearance and serene atmosphere. The way that facial expressions and interpersonal actions are animated is done superbly. Great use of lighting and shot composition. In general, it has its moments of fluidity and maintains standard quality but there are also times where the production values take a hit. The cinematography suffers from the use of CG on civilians in the background, easily the biggest flaw in the entire show like you cannot un-see it. \\n\\n\r\nThe score is beautiful! It becomes one with all of the themes and the aesthetics of Tsuki ga Kirei. There\u2019s a great understanding of the use of the piano by perfectly balancing the harmonics with both bright and mellow tones which gives the anime added colour with a wide variety of harmonics to compliment the many emotions throughout the series. Other classical instruments, like acoustic guitar, violins and the harp playing not only set a happy and vibrant mood but introduces a high-level of elegance to some of the music for that magical and alluring effect in its delivery\u2014fitting the chemistry between Kotarou and Akane. There are a few insert songs but they are used appropriately in the given segments they are played in. The Opening \"Imakoko\" by Nao Touyama is full of energy and the Ending \"Tsuki ga Kirei\", also by Nao Touyama, take the emotional approach with its gentle and delicate use of vocals and classical instruments. Although a different subject I also really liked the extra side stories at the end of each episode after the Ending. The comedic vibes and the different pairing of characters were really fun, further showing us more of the side characters that don\u2019t get the shine time needed.\\n\\n\r\nTsuki ga Kirei is definitely a gem, a love letter to the romance genre, it simply accomplishes what many romance series fail to achieve and that\u2019s making all the simplicities in adolescence and falling in love accurately portrayed. It paints a more realistic and relatable love tale on our canvas without turning it into an out-of-control melodrama. The way the story ends is one of the best I have seen out of the genre, and it happens twice! We get an emotional scene that tugs on the heartstrings where Kotarou gives Akane a beautiful send-off and when the credits roll, we get to see panels of a happily-ever-after ending for the couple. It made the slow-pace journey worth it and more, proving a love story doesn\u2019t have to be complicated to be great. It's always the simple that produces the marvellous.\\n",

            "content": "We see a bunch of romantic anime every season, some with absurd history's, totally out of the reality. We just need a romantic genre more realistic, an anime we see ourselves there, our life, our love, our own history.\r\nI had a lot of hopes with Tsuki ga Kirei, fortunately, all of them was completed. The synopsis was very catchy for me, and me as romantic anime fan, I couldn't lose this. \r\nI think I can describe it like \"simple\". This is the magic with TgK, a history we can see every day, a history that we lived in the past, or that we're living now.Those moments that we became shy with with the person that we like, the online messages, a more simply and pure love... all of this make this a great anime.\\n\\n\r\nSo, my notes:\\n\\n\r\nStory: This is the point! A simple history, just great. (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nArt: It's a point this anime unfortunately went down. The background CG's didn't disturb me, but I think it's a point that can improve, also, the design of the characters with that \"withe detail\", could improve too. (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nSound: No doubts, they did a great work here. The OSTs are very beautiful and the opening and ending... I don't have words... just listen. (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Well, they are great, but sometimes they did things... WOW? NO MAN, DO IT, DON'T STAY THERE, GO! I think it can improve some of his actions. (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This story reflected a part of my life, and appeared in a very propitious moment. (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall: If you're not too critic with the art, and appreciate a \"simple\" romantic history, go watch Tsuki ga Kirei!",

            "content": "'Tsuki ga kirei' ... \"The moon is beautiful\" This is a well known Japanese saying that also serves as a confession of 'I love you'. It is a representation of how true love between two people transcends simple words. This anime tells a heartwarming tale of a love that didn't need a white knight or an overly charismatic gigolo. In a sense, it was love in its purest form. The anime captures the essence of romance simply through the expressions of the characters, their posture, and their fidgeting. Watching the two inexperienced lovers, you can't help but cheer for them.\r\nWe don't all live in thefantasy dream-like romantic school life that a lot of romance anime seems to always use, but that doesn't mean that there isn't love to be found in everyday life. Whether it be a fleeting glance or a comedic emoji sticker sent via a messaging app, there is meaning in these seemingly insignificant events, just like how the simple phrase 'the moon is beautiful' can be a confession of love.\\n\\n\r\nThe music and art are simple, fitting right with the theme of the show. Tsuki ga Kirei is not about the ostentatious and the extraordinary aspects of romance. It's about the charm of even the simplest aspects, and the music and art is there to share that, not hot the spotlight.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps one might find this too idealistic and nobody could blame them. For us in the real world, our mistakes, inexperience, and life circumstances may prevent us from ever experiencing the ideal fairytale. However, Tsuki ga Kirei provided a heartwarming tale with flying colors, and I'm glad to have gone through its journey.",

            "content": "It is true that school-life is one of the most common genres in Japanese animation. From specialty school (magic, cooking etc) to school-life with mysteries or supernatural. In short, it is a genre that has been widely exploited in all respects. As for Tsuki ga Kirei, it doesn't pretend to revolutionize the genre and doesn't propose an original plot at first.\r\nIn fact Tsuki ga Kirei is exceptional in its simplicity. The relationships between the different characters are particularly well developed. The series accurately combines the gestures, facial expressions of the characters without exaggerating the reactions, which in some scenes may seem surprising and unexpected. Theseries doesn't necessarily focus on the dialogues and emphasizes the subtlety of the reactions of the characters making the relationships very realistic.\\n\r\nThe other point is the meeting of our two protagonists: Akane and Kotarou. Initially they don't know each other. They notice briefly in the classroom and do not talk to each other. Their relationship is built slowly but surely. At first, they look at each other several times discreetly, meaning that they are interested in each other. Then, following certain trivial events, they meet several times. Of course, you may be a little irritated by their behavior because they are shy and because they do not dare look at each other to discuss. But gradually they learn to know each other.Also social networks play an important role in their relationship and in general we notice the omnipresence of LINE (very popular in Japan) among students.\\n\\n\r\nThis relationship will gradually evolve into a romantic relation. And with this type of relationship come all the difficulties that go hand in hand, namely the acceptance of the relationship by the entourage and the friends. Jealousy? Envy? Different feelings that lead some characters to interfere in the Akane-Kotarou couple and possibly create love triangles. Do not expect ridiculous infidelities that would be completely out of step with the personality of our protagonists. Of course there will be difficult times calling into doubt the feelings of another or his, wondering how their relationship is solid. And thank God! the series does not propose forced drama with characters who cry to each episode in order to move its audience.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore our characters live with their families. Surprisingly and relatively rare in a school-life, we see the parents of our two protagonists. This aspect contributes to the realism of the series allowing us to see the relationship of our protagonists with their family. Especially that of Kotarou with his mother who regularly opposes his son because the latter privileges his dream of becoming a writer to his studies. Akane's and her sister's relationship is also very interesting, as she often gives advice on Akane's love life. Besides our two protagonists also have their occupations: Akane participates in the athletic club and Kotarou at the festival of the city. The series devotes time to show their perseverance and motivation to achieve their goals. To return to what I was saying on LINE, I was surprised by the modernity of this series. Especially when a publisher recommends Kotarou to write light novels ((Kotarou doesn't seem to know it) or the big sister who laughs when she sees Akane knitting a scarf for Kota. (She also mentions that they are in 2017)\\n\\n\r\nConcerning the secondary characters, Chinatsu and Hira receive a screen time sufficient for their characterization and develop their interests and objectives. For the other characters I wouldn't say they are useless because regularly, in several scenes, some play a prominent role in the Akane-Kotarou relationship. I regret that the series doesn't spend more time for these characters. Although at the end of each episode we see small short films showing funny moments among the various couples formed of these supporting characters. Contrary to our two main protagonists, they have already developed relations. I thank the writer because he has not censored allusions about the nights that the couples spent together.\\n\\n\r\nOn the technical aspects, the artistic direction has the merit of being unique with simple chara-design without weird hair colorings (except Roman lol). The soundtrack plays an important role in creating a peaceful and relaxing atmosphere. But many scenes have no background music, preferring to highlight the sound effects. No use of artifices to reinforce dramatic moments, just discrete tracks. I don't forget the remarkable performances of Nao Touyama in the scenes where the characters don't speak allowing the viewer to rest while contemplating the cityscapes or the daily life of the characters. However I have spotted is the use of the CGI on the characters in the background which is frankly unpleasant and which I hope will be corrected in the blu-ray. (I sometimes feel they limp)\\n\\n\r\nI personally had a great time watching this series. I agree that the series doesn't have a deep or complex plot that allows it to stand out from other works but nevertheless I have no really honest criticism to make it except one or two above-mentioned. The guiding principle of the series has always been respected and has mantain a certain coherence from beginning to end. If you are looking for a school-life with genuine relationships, I can only recommend that you throw yourself on it. On the contrary, if you prefer school-life with redundant gags and more eccentric characters, the series is not for you. However, I think Tsuki ga Kirei is a unique experience that should be watched by anyone looking for novelty.",

            "content": "When attempting to define romance, a few notions come to mind: a feeling of excitement, a remoteness from the mundaneness of everyday life, or perhaps a quality of mystery. These are the qualities that litter the romance genre today. However, one cannot discount the impact that simpler techniques create; subtle changes in body language during an involving conversation, an alter in the pitch of a voice after an unexpected text, or the absence of any background music so that any impertinent buffer is removed at a crucial developmental moment. It is in these archaic ways that Tsuki ga Kirei manages to strike me as notjust a school romance, but as a relevant and relatable tale of finding acceptance in one\u2019s self. By adapting these aforementioned techniques, it is no wonder that Tsuki ga Kirei is seen as an excellently produced tale in the field of romance.\\n\\n\r\nBefore embarking on Tsuki ga Kirei\u2019s 'emotional roller-coaster', or often lack there of, there's a key symbolic concept that is readily used throughout the series\u2019s run-time and that involves the use of the moon. There is a saying that goes as such: \u201cThe moon teaches us that darkness can\u2019t hide the beauty of life if we know how to reflect beauty\u201d. It is with the use of this abstract idea, that the growth of the main characters in the story takes place and how they can break out of their apprehensive shells and eventually find affection for another person. An example which illustrates this is during the ending sequence in each episode where a moon appears on the top right-hand corner of the screen. Starting from a new moon and concluding with a full moon, this imagery hints that in the end the romance between Akane and Kotarou will have been fully realised and will come into fruition. This is further shown, as a full moon is often seen as a symbolism for height of power, the peak of clarity, fullness and obtainment of desire: which in this case is romantic tension. \\n\\n\r\nIn addition to this allegory, quotes from a famous Japanese author, named Osamu Dazai, are tastefully used in each episode. These quotes are directed from Kotarou\u2019s point of view and are applicable to the advancement of the story. In episode 1 the quote \u201cThe feeling of joy is perhaps like a speck of gold, glimmering faintly at the bottom of a river of grief\u201d is used, while in a later episode the recitation \u201cThis is what I want to believe implicitly: Man was born for love and revolution\u201d. These aren\u2019t utilised without any ulterior purpose simply to sound high-witted, but are imperative to give the viewer the ability to follow the state of the story, as well as to read the character\u2019s mind-sets at that point in time: starting from the initial moment when affection is first sparked, until the eventual full-fledged liaison.\\n\\n\r\nAs stated in the introduction, refining of simple techniques are used in Tsuki ga Kirei. These techniques are made use of because in essence, this is a simple story: two middle-schoolers meet by sheer chance and a romance blooms. The advantage of such a straight-forward setting is that the more vital features of a good story are highlighted, while simultaneously a large audience is able to enjoy said story, since there is not a lot of challenging information which needs to be digested first-hand. There are no deeply psychological traits here, nor are there any surreal plot-twists. In all honesty, that is precisely what made this anime so effective to me. All the viewer\u2019s focus is predominantly extended to the relationship between the characters, without much distraction from anything else. Tsuki ga Kirei, in this way, is a profoundly efficient tale as every scene exists simply to further and more strongly achieve a realistic narrative.\\n\\n\r\nCorrespondingly, the efficient nature of the story is accentuated by the barren use of any major drama or comedy segments (in the main story at least). While these attributes are certainly existent, similarly to the quotations of Dazai, they are applied elegantly and are spread enough apart from one another, so that no overwrought or soppy scenes would strive the viewer away from the show's principal backbone; which once again is the successful capturing of a realistic and believable cast of characters set in a logical and credible environment.\\n\\n\r\nThe only issue I personally experienced with Tsuki ga Kirei\u2019s story, ironically (as this is the event that sold most people into becoming infatuated with the show), is with the ending itself. Although beautifully executed, I feel as if it ventured away from what the production attempted to achieve and that is centrally a credible chain of events, but I digress as I was relatively pleased with the finale.\\n\\n\r\nMatching the astounding storytelling, what makes the characters so rational is that they all have their own respective backgrounds, quirks and set of values. This makes each persona their own, instead of relying on tired tropes which bargain on a gimmick to describe their personalities. Equally, one of the most notable achievements in Tsuki ga Kirei is the manner in which the characters enhance each other throughout the series, but more on this later on. Foremost I want to talk about the two protagonists:  Azumi Kotarou and Mizuno Akane, starting with Azumi Kotarou.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is told chiefly from the perspective of Kotarou as he gradually develops a meaningful connection with Akane, while exploring the changes that occurs in his adolescent mind. What makes him such a proper protagonist is that he acts, sounds and thinks like a child in his age. Combining a fascination for classical writing and love for shadow-boxing, he feels like a living, breathing person and in the same fashion as the story he is shown in a diffident, simplistic light, once again rejecting any unnecessary personality traits which would likely distract from his maturation as a teenager. He is an individual filled with a past of embarrassments and regrets; he has felt failure many a time yet he is determined to succeed in the end. The outstanding writing and characterisation allows for Kotarou to feel genuinely authentic as he is not shown to be without flaws, yet simultaneously he has enough motivation in himself so that he is an ever-changing and distinctive person, without the limits seen in typical male protagonists.\\n\\n\r\nAkane is the female leading character and, besides acting precisely how a middle-school girl would, has her own key traits which allows for her to have an ineluctable bond with Kotarou. She too has experienced sorrows such as constantly moving homes and failures such as losing sprinting races despite years of preparation that permits her to have this innate and almost platonic initial connection to Kotarou, as they both share similar experiences and so can converse about their problems together. However, unlike the way in which Kotarou is portrayed, Akane has experienced and tasted success; she achieves high grades in school and readily surpasses her previous record times in track and field. She also often plays with this potato plush toy, which underscores her anxious nature, increasing the amount of realism in her personality. This opposing nature in character, leads to our main male lead to almost yearn for and strive to be like Akane; this leaves the story space to work with and manipulate its run-time and thus leading to maximum evolution in their romantic relationship, which suggests why Tsuki ga Kirei is so efficacious as a romance.\\n\\n\r\nAs previously stated, a remarkable achievement of Tsuki ga Kirei is how different characters enhance each other during the run-time of the show. This enhancement is achieved by the surprising use of both sets of parents of the main characters. For both parties, parents provide much-needed support, be it in a direct way such as motivational talks, or in a laconic and unhurried way such as the making of a celebratory lunch box. Parents are underused in media in my opinion, as more often than not only one parent exists as the focal role for development. This is a waste of good influence, however, as parents are constantly around the characters we follow in stories, so the presence of both a mother and a father is more likely to lead to strengthening of the more relevant characters.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the side-characters do not have as much exposure as Kotarou and Akane, they do a great job of adding gravity and intensity to the relationship between them. They are all well crafted and balanced and often have their own battles and desires, which creates increased tension in the overall atmosphere of the series. Something, however, that I would have liked to have been done better is the reasoning behind the actions that some characters take later on the story. I can\u2019t help but feel as if these were slightly rushed so that the intrinsic romance is focused on instead. In a way this is forgivable, as teenagers often act irrationally and radically, particularly in situations such as love which they may not have as much experience in.\\n\\n\r\nThe art, although once again simple, contributes greatly to the relaxed atmosphere of the anime. Backgrounds are meticulous compared to that of the foreground and the designs of the characters. This, together with the use of blank space and white accenting is perhaps to further emphasise how simple humans, especially in their younger ages, truly are as well as the nostalgic feeling of first falling in love. The facial expressions characters make, although lacking detail, are accurate to the emotions felt at that point in time. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation, however, is more polarising. Despite the fact that many frames are drawn to highlight an accurate representation of a character\u2019s actions, the flow of these frames is commonly ruined by sloppy editing, leading to an almost jerky aesthetic. Furthermore, the use of CGI in the background for crowds of people makes casual movement robotic to say the least. These CGI models don\u2019t carry themselves as fluidly as the drawings do and often end up looking comedic. In retrospect, however, Tsuki ga Kirei\u2019s production team was struggling to release episodes on time, so this is less of an issue concerning talent and more of an issue on time management. \\n\\n\r\nOne of Tsuki ga Kirei's most surmounting achievements for me, were the extra phonetics the voice actors made during a lot of the dialogue segments. This produces an almost lifelike status when hearing characters converse, as their conversations mimicked that of an actual discussion. Not only this, but especially in the opening episodes the awkward disposition between Kotarou and Akane\u2019s relationship was further realised by this effortless technique. Besides this, the voice-acting itself was as well pleasant to listen to, especially knowing how both protagonists\u2019 actors were relative newcomers to the industry, accommodating for a more genuine-sounding series as the viewer relates that unfamiliar voice to the specific character being voiced.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack itself was comprised of some wonderful vocal insert songs and a pleasant array of classical instruments. These were used sparingly and so no particular soundtrack ever felt forced or hackneyed, which is quite rare for a show especially when you have marathon-ed it, like I did. Perhaps a hindrance I felt with the show\u2019s musical score, is that no singular song especially stood out to me. This may, of course, simply be a result of the abundance of different soundtracks used.\\n\\n\r\nFrom its hyper-realistic setting with stunningly crafted backgrounds, to its effortless communication of emotion at just the right times, Tsuki ga Kirei is an anime which promptly came to my surprise from the very first minute of the first episode. Euphoric yet wistful, joyful yet dismal, melancholy yet hopeful, the innate beauty which Tsuki ga Kirei permeates can dispense a wide array of emotions. For myself, this allure lead to tears being shed through almost every episode despite there being no logical reason to. But in shows like these, reason should be the last thought in your mind: \\n\\n\r\njust sit back and cherish the inevitable void you will feel once the 12th episode hits 24:26. \\n\\n\r\nStory - [Score: 8.5/10]\\n\r\nCharacters - [Score: 8.5/10]\\n\r\nAnimation/Art - [Score: 6.5/10]\\n\r\nSound - [Score: 8/10]\\n\r\nEnjoyment - [Score: 9/10]\\n\\n\r\n[Final Score:  8.2/10]\\n\\n\r\nFinal comment:  An absolute marvel of a school romance; there may never be another like it of its caliber for me.",

As what some others have said, I also agree that this show is something refreshing and nice to watch. \r\nThe story has good development overtime. It's not really rushed a lot with tons of scenes and action that was all done in one go. The story progressed at a reasonable good pace. Though, there's a notable amount oftime-lapsing to transition to each episode. I did like the development for the characters too, since it went at a pace that isn't too fast for viewers to try and understand, and not too slow where the viewers will be bored.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is good quality. There were a few scenes that were done well. However, I do have some issues with a few particular scenes that could be revised for the DVD/BD Release. But other than that, I don't think it would affect much for my rating. Art wise for the characters, I liked it, and found Akane cute too. \\n\\n\r\nThe sounds is something that I found pleasant. The casts all fit with the characters represented too. What stood out for me was the noises that Akane makes. \"Eh?\" \"Aah!\" Un!\" Like Kumiko noises. Kotarou on the other hand, \"Ah..\" \"ooh..\" \"Un.\" basically like Akane but a male version. (lol) Though, that did motivate me to work on a video dedicated to both of their noises that I could find from every episode. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters, I don't have much to say (As it also contains spoilers if I do say something about them and the others) but characters that will make you want to like, laugh at, or maybe be going, \"What? No! Don't you dare do that!\" It's a typical range of emotions and stereotypes that you find in Middle/High School. I do find that the staff and producers managed to make the characters feel more interesting instead of bland.\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment with the show was lovely. I did like it how in the ED, there's text conversations that is interesting to read. I do believe someone made a forum post dedicated to translations for the conversations. Anyways, the Shorts after the ending were entertaining too. Some in which are hilarious. When I get my Blu-Ray order in October, I will definitely re watch the show to see if they changed anything from how it was aired this season.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I loved Tsuki Ga Kirei. As I stated, it's one of those original work gems that is both good and refreshing to watch. I've started to support this show by ordering the Blu-Ray. You should too if you enjoyed it! My last thoughts is that it would be lovely to see an OVA or an adaptation (like light novel, manga) for Tsuki Ga Kirei. Who knows what Studio Feel. and the staff members might do for now. Hopefully, maybe something that is good as Tsuki Ga Kirei :)",

            "content": "Every season we can watch average animes, good animes but few times we have the privilege of watching an amazing anime that will be part of us for a long time. Tsuki ga Kirei will fulfill our expectations and more.\r\nEven if the story could be at the beginning simple, it will start advancing in a way that will keep us entertained until the end. The story has excellent pacing and covers the insecurity, the desires, the doubts, the dreams of a group of teenagers. \r\nWe follow the story of a couple from the start until the end (in some way), their names are Akane andKotaru. They are just typical teenagers, and their relation starts from the immaturity and the usual shyness, the fear and the anxiety that can be found in the real world every day. As the relationship progress, we can visualize how the casual insecurity, the distance, and the everyday life issues appear and how they try to surpass them.  From my perspective, that is one of the reasons to watch this anime because in some way we will feel related to that kind of relationship.    \\n\\n\r\nThe anime has a great narrative combined with great visual art, and perfect sound timing creates a masterpiece that you will enjoy. The characters are well developed, they transmit their feelings, emotions to the audience and not only the main ones, but the extra characters also add some atmosphere to the story. \\n\\n\r\nThe music and the songs are great. They used it in the perfect timing, and it doesn't destroy the narrative or the visual. The story is balanced in the perfect sense of the word. \\n\\n\r\nOne last advice, please read the line messages, there are some translations if you don't know Japanese, they are short stories about the relationship and will add more ideas about it. You could try to guess if they are related to them or not :P \\n\\n\r\nYou should try to watch it if you like romance stories and a slice of the life stories. If you are seeking fights, actions or anything different, you should skip this anime. \\n",

            "content": "Tsuki ga Kirei is a boring adolescent romance that masquerades as something more than it is. Subverting standard romance tropes is not something that by default makes a romance any more realistic or compelling if it's still lacking in anything substantive. \r\nThe main couple have a serious lack of chemistry that plagues the show from front to back. Their reservations and quaint interactions are cutely refreshing and much more in line with the actuality of young love than your typical anime portrayal. That said, I still don't understand why they liked each other in the first place or why that feeling only grew over time.They were awkward, but it wasn't just a cute awkward, they legitimately had nothing substantive to talk about, ever. It felt ironically shallow. Nothing particularly exciting happened either, which is fine, or actually it isn't, because I don't watch television or film to be bored out of my mind. I have more pressing things to do than conduct pointless meta-analysis on how a boring anime is actually good because it isn't generic. Uniqueness and quality are not mutually exclusive metrics.\\n\\n\r\nTsuki's side characters are also extremely undeveloped and not impactful. The show employed an interesting technique of having brief side character stories shown after the ED of each episode, but these were far too scattered and simplistic to provide any insight into the actual characters. 'Twas nothing more than some quick laughs arising out of character interactions from characters' faces you sadly may not even recognize or ever see again. Back to the main show, the two romantic foils, who had actual relevant screen-time, disappointingly ended up amounting to nothing more than stale obstacles. There was also no discernible difference between the two's roles in the series. Furthermore, there really wasn't a discernible difference between the two main characters themselves other than gender. The pseudo-plot is that they're very goal oriented and longing to fulfill their dreams. The actual plot is that they're regular kids who aren't interesting to watch and have no business falling in love. \\n\\n\r\nThe art style is a blatant ripoff of Kimi no na Wa. Which is good, in the sense that Kimi no na Wa has a great art style, but somewhat shameless nonetheless. The fonts, the lighting techniques, the environments,.. everything screamed budget Shinkai. I sure hope he gets royalties from this show for inadvertently providing the entire visual framework. There was also a very prevalent usage of CGI for background characters in Tsuki ga Kirei, which was wholly unnecessary and distracting. The CGI was awful and not befitting of modern animation standards. There was also no real need to have crowds of background characters populating every scene. The environments were perfectly fine on their own. The music was decent but nothing notable and the voice acting was very poor. I haven't heard so many audible groans, breaths, and bodily noises since I last watched Dragon Ball Z. Why write actual script when you can pencil in dumb, nonsensical noises?\\n\\n\r\nWatch Kimi ni Todoke or Ao Haru Ride if you want to see shy young people fall in love organically. Those shows are compelling, in part, because high school is an interesting romantic setting. Middle school is not. Please remind me of a middle school romance you remember that wasn't shallow and forced. Tsuki ga Kirei is the most forced romance I've ever watched, personally. That's not enjoyable.",

This show can bring back nostalgia about how dumbfounded we had been when we experienced love in the middle school.\r\nThe art style is very unique with the watercolor palette and will be very distinguishable at the first episode. It\u2019s fitting in the general feel of the show, which is like the reminiscent of our youth days. There\u2019s a lot of great sceneries which somewhat akin to what Makoto Shinkai\u2019s produced in his works.\r\nThe soundtracks help a lot in creating the atmosphere of thescene and are noteworthy. The OP is beautiful yet exciting, the same goes to the ED and insert songs (though both are calmer). All in all, the sounds are working in concert with the art to create a delightful duo for our senses.\\n\\n\r\nBoth of the main characters seem like dandere because of how shy they are except with the ones they\u2019re close to. This helps create heartwarming awkward moments between the two of them. Other supporting characters also show interesting premise for future episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe slow-paced nature of this show may turn away some people off, but actually it\u2019s the strong point. It also occasionally surprises us with the sudden increment of development in the story. This anime might be a hidden gem in this season or maybe this year because of how down-to-earth it is and it might refreshes our not-so-pure self with something as innocent as this.\\n",

Their feelings and circumstances are extremely believable and everything is treated in a very gentle manner. And up to now I have loved every single episode I have seen.\r\n---\r\nI wouldn't normally follow a story about middle-schoolers, however I am not sorry I started watching this. It delivers an overall sweet and considerate story, and is the only decentromance anime that this season has to offer us.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is very down to earth, boy meets girl, they gradually get closer. Although the pacing of the anime seems slow (in terms of how the scenes are constructed), I would say that (at least by shoujo standards) things are actually evolving pretty quickly. I like the story because it feels authentic and earnest and because the characters inner life plays a big role. In this age of lolis, anything human and real is to be appreciated.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation are of perfectly good quality by modern standards, nothing spectacular, but I feel that lots of attention to detail was invested.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters portray what you would expect from a (no frills) 14-year old. They are discovering the world, dealing with their emotions, interests, desires... they are also quite sweet and shy :)\\n\\n\r\nI personally am enjoying this series more and more, I find it sincere and refreshing and feel swept into the characters' emotions. If you like this genre of anime, I encourage people to give it a try, the first two or three episodes should convince you.",

            "content": "Tsuki ga Kirei is like an embarrassing flashback to those days in middle school where you wanted to grow up as fast as possible and do things all the cool adults did. Remember that first time you fell in love from looking at someone, but didn\u2019t know what to do or didn\u2019t have the guts to try it out? Yeah, Tsuki ga Kirei is just a reminder what should\u2019ve or could\u2019ve happened for all those with regrets from their younger days. Tsuki ga Kirei is everything I wanted Kuzu no Honkai to be, the characters are brimming withpersonality, the visual storytelling is off the charts, and there is more to it than just a love story. Each character has their own aspirations and there is substance to why they exist. I\u2019m glad the show takes its subject matter seriously, because there\u2019s not a lot of room for comedic relief and gags in a show trying to express how difficult young love is. Characters have insecurities and can\u2019t explain why they feel a certain way to specific people. Tsuki ga Kirei does a great job showing how young people can make relationships work without needing a reason.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, the story is basically what the synopsis is saying. However, that is just a hair of what Tsuki ga Kirei is trying to express. It goes without saying that we are going to see these characters mature, as they are in their adolescence stage. But just the cringy awkwardness of character interactions and difference in personalities depending on settings just show that the writers care a little bit more about portraying the life of adolescent teenagers taking the next step in life. Besides even showing the romance between our main characters, (which I think is its weakest link) the development each character gets leads to satisfying results. The show doesn\u2019t hold back in regards to losing out. No doubt by the end of this anime, we see characters mature and become their own person. The process of getting to that point makes Tsuki ga Kirei different from other anime in the romance drama/ coming of age anime.  \\n\\n\r\n\tThe characters are all full of life and are definitely the high point of this anime. The character interactions in this are what you\u2019d expect from middle schoolers ready to get into their na\u00efve \u201cwe will be together forever!\u201d stage. However, it\u2019s a joy seeing how characters think about other things other than this character or meaningless gossip. Of course, gossip plays a part in the story, but there isn\u2019t anything overly dramatic where it forces an interaction like for example the main guy saving the main girl from girls talking about her behind her back. What we get are characters listening to what peers say and coming to the realization that it\u2019s not a bad thing to fall in love with this certain someone. While it\u2019s really cheesy, the portrayal of these real-life scenarios is what really makes these characters shine. There ends up being a love triangle in this Tsuki ga Kirei, but instead of the really cringy \u201clet things flow\u201d that anime does, the characterization really shows through these scenes. Instead of letting it go, characters resolve themselves to see it through to the end and it just makes me feel so bad because it makes me regret seeing these young kids do what I couldn\u2019t (it also makes me feel great). Seeing every character go beyond their roles is what gave me the most enjoy watching Tsuki ga Kirei. \\n\\n\r\n\tThe visual presentation of Tsuki ga Kirei was really breathtaking sometimes. It\u2019s use of angles and scenes with no words but animation created powerful scenes. Accompanied with the music, it really brings out the mood and atmosphere of whatever scene we\u2019re watching. Of course, the animation itself isn\u2019t that great, there are instances of awful CG characters and some sloppy animating of the main characters, but all can be forgiven because the most powerful scenes were the best animated. Also, the music really brings out the charm in some of the romantic scenes. It\u2019s excellent how the animations and music mesh together and it\u2019s almost rare nowadays to see anime express themselves like this.   \\n\r\n\tI also really liked the skits at the end of the first 7-9 episodes, they were funny to watch and just that little bit of screen time makes me think of characters I would otherwise not even bat an eye to after they\u2019re off the screen. They were also just a slight, but effective addition to the overall narrative Tsuki ga Kirei is going for, so I\u2019ll accept them. \\n\\n\r\nSide Note: too bad Chinatsu was the weakest link in all this.\\n\\n\r\n\tAll in all, Tsuki ga Kirei impressed me. The setting and age of the characters leaves the anime vulnerable to pandering, but Tsuki ga Kirei went above that and elevated itself above most romance anime by taking its subject matter seriously and not making a joke of it. The empathy I got from watching these characters struggle is what lead me to believe that the writers didn\u2019t joke around when it comes to adolescent love. The satisfaction I got from watching characters talk out their problems and resolving themselves for hard decisions is what really made me like these characters. The plot also has decent substance without using that much exposition, as previously said. The directing was very good and projected the characters emotions very well. The overall package of Tsuki ga Kirei created a very enjoyable experience for me and proves to me that anime can still be expressive and creative in ways live action movies can\u2019t.\\n",

Not only is it pretty cliche in terms of where plot points begin, how they climax and where they end, but it is absolutely ruined by its snail-slow pace. Now, again, this is one of the reasons why I tend to dislike SoLs in the first place: lack of forthcoming narrative. I believe that all stories should have, well, a story. It doesn't have to be epic. It doesn't have to invoke thunder-like emotions. But, it has to have a story. Otherwise, it's just a string of sketches, and it has no point. And that's the problem with Tsuki ga Kirei: it has no point. \\n\\n\r\nFor an example, first 2 episodes (~40 minutes), have about 5 minutes of material in the terms of narrative. Which is why nearly every new scene has like 15 establishing shots for no reason. 5 minutes of narrative, with absolutely no comedy worth a dime, stretched to 40 minutes run time. I don't understand. What's the point? Is this supposed to convey some deeper meaning I'm missing? Is it about how life is truly mundane and how little to nothing happens in our daily lives? Perhaps. Maybe that was the intention. However, there are better ways to convey this, and stretching it to 40 minutes certainly isn't a way. Maybe there's even more to it, but I'm not seeing it. I just kept trying to fill in the blanks with my own imagination, but I don't feel like it was supposed to go that way. \\n\\n\r\nFrom episode 2 onward, this speeds up somewhat, but the whole narrative is so bare bones that nothing of true consequence happens. First and foremost, what's even the point of this story? It can't be coming of age story, as characters aren't old enough for that. It can't be relaxing romance because it's boring. It can't be comedy because it's not. It can't be melodrama because it has no drama. Is it really just 'daily lives of middle school kids who kinda like each other for some reason and decide to date'? If you ever took classes on storytelling, the very first thing you'll learn is to avoid cliches. Second is that your story generally needs to have a threefold structure: incisive beginning, cumulative climax and natural ending. Whether it's in the terms of the entire narrative or just short arcs within it, if you decide to stray from this formula, you better have dozens of years of experience when it comes to writing, or whatever you do will amount to nothing. Which is the case here.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of romance here, I don't get it. Ayame and Azuki have no chemistry. They are just awkward teens that kind of decide to date. And I mean really 'awkward' of the 'awkward' kind. They're both shy, indecisive, reclusive, silent. These couples are some of the worst to write about because they have nothing captivating about them. Who will ever say that Ayame or Azuki, as individuals, are great, or even memorable, characters? No one. This isn't the case of two terribles making something great, just enhancing their template terribleness even further. All the moments they share are stuffed to shit with silence and awkward glances. I get it. That's how teens are. However, it's not interesting. Whenever we reminiscence of teen days, we don't talk about awkward relationships where nothing of consequence happened because even we forgot about it. And that's another problem here: nothing is memorable. \\n\\n\r\nThey don't have a moment together where you go 'haaah I'll remember that for good while'. Even their 'kiss' scene is cluttered with 'artsy' foreground and background to the point that the focus of the entire scene is indiscernible. I get what the show was going for, I really do. It aimed to convey the awkward days, the innocence of youth, but there's a reason why every other show that does this adds more to it: it's because that concept can't stand on its own. Hell, even in movie form, it can't stand on its own, let alone for 12 episodes. As someone who generally hates 'drama for the sake of drama' in shows, I was PRAYING for something to happen, anything. But even when it did, the show played it so safe I wondered what the hell was the point. \\n\\n\r\nOkay, I feel like I rattled on about the story for a bit too long. I'll probably get back to it when I get to the characters, but, for the time being, let's move on.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nArt has two sides: good and bad. Whenever there are only a few characters on screen, it's pretty decent. The pointless white highlights on every character were unnecessary and distracting, but it was okay. The show does have some decent moments (my favorite scene is actually the opening scene as it pans over rather interesting architecture), and bolsters some pretty decent background work.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, it all falls apart whenever we see a group of people. CG people. It clashes with background far too much, it's amateurish, it's absolutely ugly, and even people casually watching it will notice. And, as the show loves to have 26 establishing shots for every scene, you can bet your sweet ass that those CG monstrosities will be showing up in every episode. I know it's expensive to animate such scenes, but at least put some effort into CG. If you can't handle it, don't try to go for the 'impressive' perspective to awe the viewer when details ruin the entire scene.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation, it's similar to art. It has some competent animation, especially when it comes to running/dancing, but outside of it it's pretty basic. There were several atrocious scenes when people were running outside of track, but animation is salvaged somewhat with the aforementioned background work, as I oftentimes just ignored the characters altogether and looked for details in the scenery around them. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nBy far the best part of the entire anime. Even if exclude those random 2 music videos that show up because, well, episodes gotta be 20 minutes and holy shit how else are we gonna make that happen, sound on the whole was good. Music accompanied the scenes properly and it set the mood the show was going for. To be honest, most scenes that should otherwise be completely terrible were oftentimes salvaged by the music alone. It may be just me, but I generally tend to like slow piano pieces, which this show has plenty of, so it sat with me well. Not much else to say, really.\\n\\n\r\nI'd love to comment on VA's, but I bet half their scripts read 'uh' 'ah' 'umm' 'eh', so why even bother? \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nAs is the norm with these half-assed attempts at making romance of generic teens appealing, the show focuses on the 2 least interesting characters of its entire cast. Why? Why do these shows do this? Why focus on literally the most boring aspect of your narrative? I don't know. Maybe, again, it's some metaphor that reflects our own lives, maybe it's just something I don't get because I can't relate to it, but I was far more intrigued with everything else except our leading duo. \\n\\n\r\nAzumi is defined like this: shy guy who writes.\\n\r\nAkame is defined like this: shy girl who runs. \\n\\n\r\nThere. That's the characterization. There's no depth to them and, whatever depth there appears to be, is just teen angst rearing its ugly face. They are defined by their hobbies and their base characteristic. Relationships between two shy people are AMAZING for two shy people, but they're some of the most boring relationships to look at as the third party, especially when you have to stretch it over 12 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nAgain, it may be me missing some deeper narrative, but I highly doubt it. I don't think it's me missing deeper narrative, but it's simply not a show meant for me. I get that. I'm not 14 anymore and, if I'm being frank, I hate my 14y old self. I'm pretty much full-fledged adult at this point, and these 'cutesy' 'coming of age' stories just don't do it for me anymore, especially if they're so lacking in comedy. I enjoy seeing relationships, not awkward attempts at them. I enjoy seeing characters that brim with 'character', not two stick-dolls who can barely hit 'audible' in terms of volume of their voices. I enjoy narrative with a point, not attempt at basic pandering. \\n\\n\r\nI don't understand why this show is rated so highly. I don't understand why its characters and narrative and 'message' are so praised. They're basic. Take every 'awkward couple' of every romance anime, and you have it. Honestly, I even found Kimi no Todoke less boring, and it's not like Kimi no Todoke is epitome of even passable narrative. The reason I found it less boring is because it had comedy. Its characters bounced off of each other to create the comedic narrative because it was lacking elsewhere. However, Tsuki ga Kirei doesn't have that. I think I chuckled maybe once during their interactions. Was that the point? Maybe. I'm generally not the type to say 'oh, it's fine as long as you enjoyed it', as that statement encourages more of the same. I want aggressive, challenging stories. I want characters with depth, and I want to see them tackle issues in accordance to their character. There's none of that here. \\n\\n\r\nEven though I've been shitting on our main couple, it's not like side characters are any better if I'm being honest. This mainly stems from the fact that we don't see them often enough. I don't get it, though. Pretty much every episode has at least 3-4 minutes of establishing shots, so why not just use it to give your side characters SOMETHING? Those post-credit bits aren't enough. It's like the creators realized that the story lacked that comedic narrative, and just slapped some randomly irrelevant comedic bits in the end and said 'great, let's do it like this'. \\n\\n\r\nWhen that Chizu whatever best friend asked our MG 'can I confess to your boyfriend', I was honestly looking forward to their fallout. Not because 'I choose my 1week BF over my BFF', but because that's just not something you do as BFF. But nope. Why have SOMETHING interesting happen, when we can have 83 establishing shots of pointless scenes instead? \\n\\n\r\nTsuki ga Kirei is jam packed with nothing. It's a string of mundane events that offer no depth. It's an attempt at 'ordinary coming of age story' that fails to understand that ordinary doesn't equal boring and uninteresting. I spent most of my summer vacation at home, and I had way more fun than any of these characters. And that's just fucking sad. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nI didn't enjoy the show, far from it, but I'd lie if I said there isn't any merit to it. Young people nowadays lack shows like this, and I appreciate that about the show. Doesn't mean I excuse all its shortcomings, but still, it's something. It's a show that tells young people that it's okay to be boring and ordinary. And, even if I disagree with that, I can see its point. At least it's better than your generic harem and echii crap, so if you're gonna watch something, at least watch this over that. \\n\\n\r\nI don't know how the show ends. I'll probably never find out. I've been skipping scenes since episode 4, and stuffing through 40 more minutes is just not something I can do (well, 50 more minutes, as I just quit halfway through ep. 10). Whether it ends in a happy, sad or bittersweet fashion, I don't care because I don't care for the main characters. Whether their dreams come true or not, I don't care. They're 14. What the fuck are they thinking is going to happen? I don't know. \\n\\n\r\nThat pretty much summarizes my 'thoughts about the show': I don't know. I don't know whether there's some deeper narrative that I'm missing because I'm not the target audience (both in terms of the genres and in terms of the characters). I don't know if there's deeper meaning to the show's lack of any form of narrative. I don't know whether CG people are supposed to represent how our society is robotic, or whether it's just cheaper to make it that way. I don't know whether I'm dead inside, or it's just the show. I just... don't know.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nWhichever it may be, I know this isn't a show I'd recommend to anyone. Perhaps, if I was 14, I might have enjoyed the show more. But, I doubt it. I was very much different when I was 14 than our main duo, or even any other side character present here. It may be just me, and the show is truly a masterpiece that I'll never get, but at least from the technical standpoint of the writing, the show is not good. It has terrible pace. It lacks proper narrative. It uses bare bone foreshadowing (ep. 3 oh, we might be moving to Chiba = it's gonna be a major plot point for the couple later on. Whoever missed this... eh, whatever), it's stuffed with nothing, it doesn't have decently written characters, and myriad of other things that I'm probably forgetting, because I'm already forgetting the show itself. I don't think it's as bad as, say, Your Lie in April, but it's definitely far more boring than it. \\n\\n\r\nThat's really all I wanted to say. Maybe I'm truly turning into an old man... I just... don't know.",

If so then I would highly suggest watching something else. I went into this anime hoping that it would progress in a manner I am not used to but it failed to impress let alone entertain me for the majority of the season. Typical intro where the main character meets a girl who he doesn't know and for whatever reason they're instantly drawn to each other. A clich\u00e9d intro like this had me feeling asif I was going to be watching another typical shoujo anime. And boy was I right. That's not to say that the anime is horrendous, the art style is interesting and the sound is fair. The characters however, did not leave much of an impact on me at all. I felt as though I was actually watching supporting characters rather than regular characters in a story(if that makes any sense). It feels as though the characters were there because they needed to be not necessarily because they were meant to or because they fit in well. This review comes from someone who watches romance anime more often than any other genre and the rating this anime has still continues to baffle me in comparison to some of my more favorable titles. I do have to give the creators some credit because they did manage to construct a pretty eventful story in only 12 episodes without it feeling rushed, the story itself however, could've used some polishing. Check it out though, you might disagree.",

            "content": "\"It's not being in love that makes me happy. It is the person that i am in love with that does\"\r\nStory of romance sometimes are pretty generic. We see a boy and a girl fallin in love with each other then they meet some obstacle in their relationship but somehow can manage it and happy end. But of course, the differences is how they would wrap that generic story and for me, Tsuki ga Kirei have take to a whole new level of it.\r\nBrought to you by the director of famous anime, Angel Beats. The story is pretty much generic but what makes Tsuki gaKirei interesting is how they deliver the story. When we see the first second of the anime, one things that would come to our mind is 'relatable' like have you ever fallin in love with someone without any reason? and doesnt have much courage to talk with them so u just can look at him/her in a distance? for some people, they can relate this kind of romance story when they were in Junior High School like you are shy to hold your partner's hand or doesnt have any courage to talk with your crush or partner in the school. For me, i can relate to all that stuff so i can feel what the main characters feels in each scenes.\\n\\n\r\nAlong with it, there is kind of a refreshment to see how the romance develop between each characters. Because your main characters (Azumi Kotarou) isnt some of playboy with outgoing personality but a timid-literature-nerd boy who just experiencing the first love of his life and the same case for the heroine (Mizuno Akane), she is an active girl but when it comes to love she becomes timid. How they will make their relationship become much better is one of things that makes this anime interesting to see more.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the story progress is quite slow and maybe it will bore some people but this kind of approach is suitable for romance series anime because we will see much detail about their story or background and it can increase the tense that happen in some scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this anime is perfectly suit with the pure romance themes. The watercolour pallete they use are deepening the mellow atmosphere and really suitable with story. The background also pleasing to see like it's kind of Makoto Shinkai works but instead using sharp colour they're using subtle and watercolour pallete. Though not many people get used with this kind of art.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, i found this anime is enjoyable to watch and so far is still interesting to see what happens next. This anime maybe would be a hidden gem in this season if they still continuing with kind of pace and have a kind of twist in the end.",

            "content": "[7.5/10]\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\nBehold first love. A first kiss. A tender touch. Without it, we would cease to grow. A metaphoric stomping on roots. Painted through cliche, breathing through understatements. Each veteran, wandering eye gazing down at innocence and wishing to relive moments missed. Missed through longing or melancholy. A bittersweet visage of young love remarked dismissively by jaded tongues. If only my own wasn't so jaded.\r\nThese moments, mandatory, yet romanticized. It's in the genre, after all. Yet that's so often the failure. Perfection is wanted, but only through shallow wishes. Wanting perfection in a relationship is like wanting world peace. An empty claim that flirts with ignorancemore so than profundity. It's hollow, and maybe that's the point. The more hollow something is, the easier we can attach and fill that shell with our own viscous desire for something which we unconsciously know will never be experienced. It's a fleeting world of returned passion and beleaguered, yet gleaming puppy love.\\n\\n\r\nThat's the world which Azumi and Mizuno inhabit. Two last-year middle schoolers swept up by one another's awkward glances and burning blushes. Where handholding is first base and meeting lips may as well warrant contraceptive. Where their world veers right where many anime tend to drive forward is in the presentation of the setting. Where romance anime often pulls back on verisimilitude to create melodrama, Tsuki Ga Kirei attempts to create a bond through experience. Walking along an empty street, something as innocuous as eating lunch with one another, yet painted with a thick enough brush to be seen as romance. \\n\\n\r\nThese scenes border on Iyashekei, as they hold no value to anyone who doesn't want to spend time with these characters. In those moments, the moments in which we look to a budding relationship, not through admittance or confession, but through the experience of human emotion, are the series at its peak. Its ability to let these characters and their stories breath in a short twelve-episode runtime shines brightest once the final credits roll. While not devoid of melodrama, as the all-consuming love-triangle looms heavy over this lovable romp, it is dealt with so relaxed, with such an incredibly small pool of tears, that it ceases to even feel as abrasive as it actually may be. \\n\\n\r\nIf action anime can often be conflated with B-movies, shlock entertainment, and pulp, then romance anime would fall under the equally divisive umbrella of soap opera and cable-access drama. Something that generally feels vapid and empty, banking more on the attractiveness of the leads than the narrative or characters. This approach may be assumptive and, to a certain extent, overly amalgamating an entire medium and genre into one pigeonholed view, it does, however, hold some truth to it. This may be based on the small pool I've consumed, but these elements within anime are so abundantly clear to anyone who's watched an expansive amount of any kind of entertainment, that I feel like it is difficult to argue against.\\n\\n\r\nWith that notion established, you are left to your own devices. They must be used to determine whether or not this kind of entertainment truly appeals to you. Do you revel in the shlock? The pulp? The medium which can easily become trite and redundant if you look just past the surface? Or will your critical lens prevent you from doing that?  Perhaps the answer is more complicated. Taste, after all, is multi-faceted and you can appreciate many different forms of entertainment, different genres and even subgenres presented in unique ways. I, like many others, have exactly that outlook on my own taste.\\n\\n\r\nFor example, action anime rarely does anything for me. I have a very specific outlook and belief in the way I understand and enjoy action sequences. Whether it be the nail-biting thrill of a bank-robbery to the fist-clapping bravado in an action spectacle like Pacific Rim or Fury Road. There's an exact understanding of what makes my dopamine rush and unfortunately, that \"something\" isn't prevalent in the action anime I consume. The over-the-top nature of so many series' that I watch quickly becomes a bore when I'm regularly forced to witness such below-average presentation.\\n\\n\r\nThe same can be said about romance. A genre which I'm most critical of simply by being something which I harbor little interest in. The outcomes fostered by generic romance writing are continuously so banal that the entire genre has fallen into a kind of malaise which I'm not even attempting to break free from. This malaise, of course, is my own mea culpa. Now that's not to say romance can't be done well. However, add anime's tendency to focus on abrasive melodrama and over-the-top cloying emotionality and my interest in the genre is borderline non-existent. \\n\\n\r\nThus Tsuki Ga Kerei decided to seemingly be the antithesis of what I've come to expect from romance anime. While the usual, outlined elements are there. Specifically, the too-good-to-be-true moments which romance enjoys basking in. There is a very distinct approach to go against the grain in a surprisingly effective way. The focus on experience over melodrama does so much to establish characters which would otherwise have little to no personality to actually connect with. It's so refreshing to see an anime where I can't pinpoint the otaku-driven character archetypes. \\n\\n\r\nParents, not only being present but being major players within a romance? An emphasis on legitimate, non-sexual awkwardness? It would seem as though this series traveled through the nether. From a dimension similar to ours but where romance anime actually gets a chance to explore non-market-demanded characters in situations that aren't simply made to pluck at whatever heartstrings aren't calloused over from the suffocating saccharine nature of this genre, and, to a certain extent, the medium.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, Tsuki Ga Kirei can't escape every cliche that one would associate with the medium. The series' biggest fault is its production. It doesn't look good. The shots are often flatter than intended and even some of the better framed moments that clearly had care put into them are unfortunately marred by low production values. There is no need to even mention the horrific CG crowds which seem to have become a common staple of rushed anime. I still have to give Studio Feel. credit for focusing on some genuinely impressive character animation, at times, that gave a lot of needed exposition about some hobbies our protagonists may have. For example, our lead Azumi is clearly a fan of boxing. We see that not only from his poster above his bed but also how he treats a hanging lamp-switch like a boxing bag. Yet this isn't ever mentioned through dialogue.\\n\\n\r\nThere is still a reliance on some cloying and cliche elements here and there, and it stands out all the more when the rest of the series is oriented around a more relaxed and realistic approach to the romance. Some moments tend to drag when the focus is on spurned love, particularly in the side characters which form the love rectangle which the middle-half of the series does well to not shine an obnoxious amount of light on. Even the frustrating monologuing which so much romance anime seems to heavily indulge in is included, yet not to an extreme and the pseudo-philosophical comments on love by a character who is in middle-school are well-explained by his fascination with reading. The majority of Azumi's monologued quotes come from the beautiful pen of Osamu Dazai. \\n\\n\r\nThe resolution feels right, without feeling wholly realistic. To return back to the initial thesis about romance anime, the prevailing feeling of \"fakeness\" is still present. The situations here, while given a more satisfyingly realistic platform to bounce off of, are still not \"real\" enough to be truly relatable to anyone who isn't living the perfect life of a kid. Perhaps that is something which I will never see eye-to-eye with in this genre. These kids, each one having problems, from a struggling passion for writing which unfortunately goes a bit unexplored, to a lingering attraction to the freedom of competitive field and track.  These problems are genuinely resolved painlessly, though. While there are thankfully realistically bittersweet moments within the series, they are often back-ended by a reassuring touch from the hands of the writer, nudging you to believe that everything is still perfect.\\n\\n\r\nBehold first love, as eyes meet from across a barren dancefloor. A first kiss, in the girl's bathroom, followed by a timid apology. A tender touch, which leads to immediate recoil and guilt. Without it, I would've ceased to grow. A metaphoric stomping on my own roots. Painted through reality, breathing through experience. Each veteran, wandering eye gazing down at the loss of innocence and wishing to relive moments missed. Missed through longing or melancholy. A bittersweet visage of young love remarked dismissively by jaded tongues. Maybe that's just me, though. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Romance is a genre that has been done to death in anime. Some try to liven things up by going for a romance-comedy approach that often falls short of balancing between the two. Some try to go for moody serious drama that sometimes take itself too seriously by sprinkling dark elements into the mix resulting into a mess. Whatever various scenarios these shows present, what they all have in common is that they have always strive to show something interesting to its viewers beyond the romance, which can result to negligence of the potential development from it. \r\nIt has always bothered me, as a personwho has encountered a lot of romance fiction, that stories revolving between two pairings are often beaten around the bush up until the very end. Not that it's automatically considered a bad thing since I wouldn\u2019t mind it if there was a sense of progression in terms of character development, but the potential of a love in bloom is often ignored and then the story tries to come back to it with a very rushed resolution that can leave an unsatisfying taste. Of course, I\u2019m talking about shows that don\u2019t have romance as the only thing going for it since one that is purely about romance is a rarity. But what if there comes a show that puts all of its strengths on romance alone? This is where Tsuki ga Kirei shines through as a simple yet memorable tale of young love.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that makes this show stand out is that the romantic relationship is established midway and the rest of the episodes detail their life as a couple. Even though we had shows like Lovely Complex and Ore Monogatari in the past, Tsuki ga Kirei beats them in terms of subtleness and intimacy. It wants to be mature despite the dullness it can accumulate from stripping away so many elements that make up a typical modern school romance. It wants to show the naivety and stubbornness that first love brings and how it basically screams the laid-back yet youthful lifestyle that most of the older viewers can relate to. \\n\\n\r\nAside from the various skits presented at the end of most episodes, there is no actual comedy to be found in the show. It still maintains to be lighthearted despite that, as it never fails to leave a warm fuzzy feeling within. The chemistry between Azumi and Akane is beautiful, they are two socially awkward teenagers and it\u2019s such a delight to see the two of them dealing with their feelings. Whenever they interact, their speech is limited but their facial expressions and body language brings up the message even clearer. There might be the occasional clich\u00e9 moment here and there, but their generated reactions to such cases feel sincere enough to be not seemingly forced.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the show brings its romance to the forefront, it still manages to provide glimpses of things outside of it. Azumi is an aspiring writer and Akane is a track-and-field member and the story details their struggles of compensating between priorities. If only the show was extended for another cour, it would be nice to see the story expound on this. It is a shortcoming that I admit prevents me from giving this show a greater score, but I still think it still sufficiently manages to explore that aspect of the story well enough.\\n\\n\r\nOn the more technical side of things, the animation is quite average. It can be mediocre at times, especially when crowds of CGI people are often used in the background. However, it gives more emphasis on individual movement towards relevant characters in the scene. One certain scene that stuck out the most is the one where Azumi is doing the festival dance with such eccentric animation but weirdly hypnotizing with its frequent thrusts and fluid maneuvers. The character design is quite good, nothing flashy but it\u2019s pretty simple. The soundtrack is amazing and it helps set the mood and elevate emotional buildup at certain scenes. I can\u2019t imagine the show without its piano-driven OST to be honest, as the show would\u2019ve been too dull for my liking without it. \\n\\n\r\nFor a show that is about love, it might\u2019ve been too optimistic. There were attempts to complicate the romance with a third party, but it got resolved swiftly. School matters were also used as a deciding factor for the couple\u2019s relationship, but they still remained victorious in the end. It has its highs and lows and the story went ahead for a positive fulfilling conclusion. It might be too plain and basic for other people, but it feels very genuine enough to work as a compelling school romance. It might\u2019ve been paced too slowly for anything interesting to happen every minute, but it\u2019s that careful approach towards romance that creates a feeling of emotional tension.  Maybe a straightforward story about love and its dealings like Tsuki ga Kirei can possibly save and revitalize the romance genre, that keeping things simple can be effective as long as it has a sense of direction leading to a realization that brings a profound emotional impact. Who knows, but I have still hope that romances like this will continue to exist in the future.\\n",

            "content": "In an era where people continously gush about Serial Experiments Lain for being one of the most mind-boggling shows to ever come out of Japan, in an era where people all over the world jump from excitement when they see a new fight in Boku No Hero Academia, in era where people consider Rem from Re:Zero to be their ideal waifu, there's something that I always felt was left underappreciated. That thing was simplicity.\r\nSome look at simple shows and say that they're not making their minds busy, some say that they're not worth their time when so many excellent, fantastical adventures await, but for onceI want to give credit to a wonderful, amazing piece of animation that just followed every single step of how to create a great anime, and it did so to with the understanding of each of those elements and with the passion for a project that isn't as exciting as some would like.\\n\r\nTsuki Ga Kirei is a show that could only be created through anime, as it is absolutely boring on paper and wouldn't sell anywhere else. With that in mind, it almost seems as if the people who created it wanted to prove to themselves and to the audience that simplicity can be an advantage. With pretty much every possible part of this series being handled with care and ingenuity, it shines much brighter than most anime with an original or a fantastical plot.\\n\\n\r\n*A few spoilers included*\\n\\n\r\nTsuki Ga Kirei doesn't only tell a story, it SHOWS you a story. This is something that can usually be swept under the rug, but here the visuals are much more important the the written word. With a simple premise of \"boy meets girl, he likes to write, she likes to run\" creating melodrama and simple arcs wouldn't be enough. So the director decided that he will just tell you everything, and I mean every single thing, through visuals alone. As an original work, this was possible more than with most other series that are just adaptations of writtern word. Now, don't get me wrong, people speak, there are dialogues, monologues, everything of the sorts, it's just that most of the exposition for the world and the characters is done either through quick, short versions of those things, or entirely through the visuals and music.\\n\r\nThe perfect example for this would be one of the little quirks of the main character Azumi. In his room, there's a a light on his ceiling with a little cord to turn it on and off. Azumi tends to punch it, but does so differently depending on his emotional state. He either does almost proffesional-like hooks when he's full of determination, playful jabs when he's in a happy mood, or throws in punches full of power whenever he's angry. This is only one of many examples of character presentation through the visuals, others include things like portrayals of happiness through uncontrollable random movement, lots of facial gestures during conversations, different body movement while being with different people, more energetic when with friends and more reserved when being with your loved ones, slowly devloping those into more expressive ones as the relationship goes on.\\n\\n\r\nThat's not the only thing however. Another one that I want to point towards is the quick shots that express a lot about characters, without the viewer even realizing it. As such, in one of the episodes, when Azumi enters his home we see his father polishing a gun, a hunting gun to be more precise. This immediately adds personality to a character that overall has very little screen time. You know he acts like a living being, by that I mean he has interests and does things on his own free time. In the same scene, in the background we see Azumi's mother washing dishes, we actually see her cleaning in different ways and caring for the home a lot. This allows us to safely assume that it's her daily work, that this is what she does for most of her time. So we can already create a pretty clear imagine of a daily life of that family, through those two or three shots alone.\\n\r\nThis also happens often with the designs, like the interior designs for example. Remember when I mentioned Azumi punching a cord? Well, it still could be weird seeing him doing this one thing out of nowhere, but if you look closely, you can se a Muhammad Ali poster next to his bed. Turns out, he's into boxing, his quirk relates to something else other than just being random.\\n\r\nThere's also minor things like the differences between his and his girlfriend's - Akane's - houses and rooms. Akane sleeps in the same room as her sister, but even then her side is extremely clean, even while studying, there are shelves full of cute things and bright colors all around. Azumi's room is more messy, but it's also darker. You can get a lot of information based on ones room they say, and here it's definitely true. You can come to many conclusions about both characters based on their rooms alone, such as \"Akane likes girly things\", \"Akane has to have everything in the right place\", \"Azumi is messy\" or \"Azumi prefers to be left alone\". All of those are true. Akane has her little pink squishy toy that helps her relieve stress, but she gets really confused whenever she loses it. Azumi's hair earned him a nickname \"Curly-kun\" for how messy they are, and when he studies his notes are all over the place, he also is in a little conflict with his mother because they disagree on what path he should take in the future, thus he prefers to be left alone in his house. It all clicks, doesn't it?\\n\\n\r\nAnd don't even get me started on the wonderul directing. Seiji Kishi, you clever bastard! I have an entire list of all the scenes that I've found to be incredible, but I'm only going to bring up a few to prove my point.\\n\\n\r\n1. First one comes from episode 7, where Azumi was searching for Akane in an amusement park. This consists of a few shots, the trick is, we see Azumi moving, but every time the background changes, he is in the same place on the screen. It symbolizes how despite him searching, he's pretty much in the same place, and while the director could've shown multiple angles, the transitions feel magical and special when he does them this way, not to mention that they are less tiring to look at and don't require to draw more with an already limited budget.\\n\\n\r\n2. Second comes from two episodes, episode 6 and 9. In those episodes, we see two of the last track meetings for the school club that Akane goes to. In episode 6, there's a lot of conflicting feelings inside her, mostly because she has to choose her boyfriend between Azumi and her track club leader Kira. This uncertainty is reflected mostly through three things: facial expressions, character positioning and lighting. Of course it is obvious that she looks troubled, but she does moreso when she realizes that her close friend Chinatsu also has a crush on Azumi. When they both walk into the arena, Chinatsu stops in the part where she's lit up by the sun, and stops Akane to tell her this when she's in the dark. The next shot we see them both, Chinatsu is practicing her running start while Akane is doing practically nothing, once again, in the shadows. Next thing we see is them preparing to start on their respective blocks, Akane breaths in and the voices of the crowd start to become quiet. The race starts and the last thing we see is Chinatsu passing Akane. As we learn later, she lost. Sulking in her defeat she sits on the stairs, once again, in the shadow as her track team leader approaches her from the right side (which is lit up of course) with an angry expression. During their conversation we slowly see how Akane's face changes into extreme despair and how Kira becomes more troubled when he notices. In episode 9 we get to see the club's last track meeting, but this time it's after Azumi and Akane confessed and have been going out for some time, leaving both Chinatsu and Kira filled with regret. This time around, Akane is in the sun for most of the shots, while Chinatsu is the one that's in the shadow. This already indicates that it's going to be a good run for Akane, and it is, in fact it's her record time! Through little subtleties this show creates an atmosphere and allows the viewer's subconsciousness to provide him with expectations. Remember, you may not notice it, but your brain always does.\\n\\n\r\n3. And as the last one I want to bring up Chinatsu's point of view after she gets rejected (well, technically doesn't confess, but she sees Azumi announce their relationship for the first time). Two scenes especially come to my mind when I think about it. One of those is when Akane drives home on a train and gets a message from Chinatsu saying \"I couldn't confess\", and the already sad and melancholic music becomes slower and more distorted, the last thin we hear is a warning sound for a closing gate... I don't have to explain that, do I? Another one happens in episode 9, as we see Azumi leaving the track meeting, Chinatsu notices him as he's exiting, but through the whole time she sees him through the bars on the gate or behind a bush, this of course symbolizes how he's too far from her reach.\\n\\n\r\nI hope that at this point you can get a good grasp on what this shows' directing visual-wise. There are many, many other shots like this, countless directing tricks that I didn't bring up here that you can find on your own. Perhaps this is what made this series so fun and exciting for me despite it being a rather slow burn. Characterization and exploration through such technical stuff is something that I'll probably never get enough of.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, it's important to bring up that there are things make the presentation overall seem less impressive. Obviously, the time limits and such led to quite a few CGI crowd models. What's even worse is that they do end up dropping the frames in several scenes. Don't let that discourage you though! This show is much better visually than just that.\\n\\n\r\nTsuki Ga Kirei knows not only how to show using visuals, but also how to tell using music. I can't quite describe how well the tracks complement the scenes, as I think this is for each person to judge separately in this case, but I want to bring attention to the moments where the show pretty much turns into a music video. There are places where everything goes silent and the only thing you hear, is a song. It's used so that showcasing even more mundane things than usual doesn't feel as mundane, instead it feels magical, captivating, it's almost as if the characters do those things with some sort of grace that none of us see on a daily basis, despite doing the same things. This is another reason why I think this series wants to put simplicity on a pedestal of glory for everyone to witness. It almost glorifies normality.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot itself does suffer a tad bit from being so normal though. Despite the excitement that spotting small details brings, watching this show just for the plot can leave the viewer a bit bored, with all the exposition shots and longer scenes included. There's this aura of awkwardness everywhere the two characters go, it fits the social ineptitude quite well but can prove to be tiring.\\n\r\nAkane and Azumi are both introverts, despite having friends and laughing with them, they aren't as expressive and don't have the same presence as someone like Roman or Chinatsu have in their respective friend circles and both prefer to keep their private life to themselves. As such, the show relies heavily on their own awkwardness, cute scenes that happen when they interact, their small quirks and speech patterns. As they start to date, all of that changes into normality and finally into boundless love. It's a very natural progression that sells the image of the series as a show about adolescence and romantic feelings during that time. It asks questions like \"should you truly commit to your first love\" and \"how much should you trust your partner\". Most of the time, it ends on a positive note, because Akane and Azumi fit each other very well, they're able to overcome their hardships through each other's advice and simple, often short talks. Knowing that there's someone always waiting to listen to them, caring for their achievements and their losses and simply someone who loves them. Their relationship also allows them to notice what other people mean for them, Akane start to distance herself from her friends a bit when she notices that some almost treat her like just another gossip material, Azumi notices that his mother really cares for him despite his shortcomings, even if she treats him like a child at times. Their relationship keeps blossoming, and even with bumps along the way they keep getting stronger with it, no matter what others say. Each event does impact both of them in a way, they're just getting more comfortable with themselves and the people they're around. Simply put: They're growing up, leaving people who keep playing children with their silly relationships behind. Their love is pure, meaningful and precious and they both believe in it.\\n\\n\r\nAnother very interesting take that this show has, is it's view on romance in modern society. Akane and Azumi at first communicate mostly though LINE, which is pretty much their version of Facebook Messenger. They smile when they see new messages, get all excited because nobody can see them, send each other cute and funny stickers. It's not only charming, but shows how that the internet can be a place, where people who typically aren't communicative speak freely and do whatever they want in the meantime, keep being awkward while also socializing. Not only that, but at no point does it feel like it's trying too hard to appeal to the teen audience with it, it really seems like people who worked on this show write like this on an everyday basis. It never boils down to just pandering to a certain audience. I find this approach very charming. It's something that hasn't been explored too much, which, when I think about it, is pretty weird with all the anime about teenagers coming out each season. Well, at the same time, not many of those have characters as socially awkward as those two dorks.\\n\\n\r\nThat's really all there needs to be said about Tsuki Ga Kirei. It's an easy to understand show, but one that's very hard to comprehend the beauty of. It is simple, it embraces being simple, but it knows how to compensate for that on so many levels. It's like a reflection of the moon on a small pond, but if you lift your head you may be able to see the true image of it on the night's sky, start noticing the stars around it that compliment it and make it even more amazing than it already is. So As the Moon, So Beautiful lights up the dark anime sky with it's imagination, I am finally able to see how wonderful can it truly be when you just put the effort into making something. I won't be forgetting this image for a long while.\\n\\n\r\nAs always, this is purely my opinion. I highly encourage you to develop your own.",

            "content": "[Middle-School Romance]\r\nAnime shows entailing romance, adolescence, and school-life are nothing new; many follow common themes, employ cliche characters, and have hackney narratives.  And, while, this show may share similar themes, its characters and narrative go beyond simple cliches.  They add hints of realism and truth, recreating events people could relate and reminisce about.  Tsuki ga Kirei may not subvert the romance genre, but its stellar technical production, realistic narrative and charming characters are both refreshing and remarkable.\r\nSTORY:\r\nThe show features a simple storyline summarized as: boy meet girl, boy falls in love with girl, boy dates girl, boy and girl stay together foreverand live happily ever after.  Its themes are also simple, revolving around youth and innocences, first love, the trials of love, and overcoming challenges.  While, its themes and storyline aren\u2019t original, its execution, and how it handles familiar themes and plot points, such as love triangles, confessions, dates, and arguments, are outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nThe setting is middle school, where our main characters are anxious, immature, and still developing.  Scenes of social awkwardness, insecurity, and fidgeting are common occurrences and, yet, scenes of confidences, determination, and acceptance occur just as often.  All of these moments add to the realism.  Speaking of realism, don\u2019t expect outrageous situations, forced drama, or random twists to interfere with the narrative.  What you can expect is a down-to-earth story with its main conflicts rooted in everyday life like dealing with first love, how and when to confess your love, how to handle awkward silence, and many more.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the pacing for this show may appear slow, however it isn\u2019t.  On the contrary, the pacing is consistent and even, each episode allows enough room for both character and plot development without any additional fillers or distractions.  Furthermore, there are no expositions; only meaningful character interactions, visual cues, and dramatic silence moments.  And, at the end, of certain episodes, are short scenes, focusing on other characters\u2019 relationships.  These scenes are cute, funny, and relatable.  Overall, the narrative is amazing and realistic.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION:\\n\\n\r\nUsing watercolor palette is an unusual art style, but one that is appropriate for this anime.  Warm light colors, like blue, pink, red, and yellow, fill the screen, cueing viewers that the tone is lighthearted and the ambience pleasant.  The lighting, while slightly bright in certain scenes, also play an important role in maintaining the tone and ambience.  The background animation features many fine details, from moving, talking crowds to tiny water droplets, that enrich the world the characters live in.  The character models are well designed, sensible, and distinctive, bringing to life the personalities and appearances of young children in their youth.  And finally, the consistent animation, accompanied with great camera angles, allow significant moments between characters to be played out.  All of these points aid in highlghting the narrative\u2019s themes and the characters\u2019 personalities.  Overall, I love the show's style of art.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, there are two minors issues, first, CGI background characters are low-detail and lousy, and second, a few animations appear choppy.  Other than those two issues, everything else concerning art and animation is perfect.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\\n\r\nLike its art and animation, the sound design, itself, is important in maintaining a certain mood and atmosphere.  For example, the opening song has fast tempos, conveying excitement and happiness, while the ending song has slow tempos, conveying serenity.  Still, both these songs are your standard J-Pop, and not as noteworthy as the voice acting, insert songs, and background sounds.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is notable for its faithful depiction of a shy middle-schooler.  You will hear sighs, mumbles and grunts, and whispers and, while this may annoy and distract some viewers, it adds to the dialogue some realism.  More importantly is how the voice actors are able to convey many emotions without being overly dramatic.  The insert songs include varies piano or orchestral pieces, which are calm and relaxing.  The background sounds, like its background art, possesses many tiny details, such as the chatter of people, the sound of falling rain, birds chirping, etc, make the show feel alive.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\\n\r\nOur main characters, Akane and Kotarou, are both charming and compelling, and are the crux of this show.  The remaining cast are there either to influence them, or 'to be influenced\u2019.  Now, there\u2019s no denying that our main leads have more screen time, thus having the most character development, while our remaining cast appear infrequently, thus having the least character development.  Still, their appearances provide some insight into their personalities, many human exchanges and reactions, and the occasional plot advancement.  They are, for the most part, an excellent supporting cast.\\n\\n\r\nAkane and Kotarou possess complex and distinctive personalities with pragmatic ambitions.  Akane is in the track and field club, and hopes to continue her passion for running in college.  She is easygoing, studious, and prone to \u2018anxiety\u2019, sneezing her potato sack to relax herself, and yet has a sociable demeanor.  Kotarou is in the literature club, and hopes to becomes a novelist.  He is carefree, composed, and likes to spout serious poetic line, yet acts silly when using LINE or when he\u2019s pretending to box his lamp cord.  \\n\\n\r\nThe character development for Akane and Kotarou is very noticeable.  In the beginning, Kotarou was very reserved and shy, only speaking to his male friends.  However, once Akane entered his life, he became more outgoing and confident.  Some scenes that demonstrate his confidence include his confession, his attempts to hold Akane\u2019s hand and asking her out on a date, and much more.  The same could seen in Akane, such as when she asked for Kotarou\u2019s number, or brought a birthday present for him.  Overall, the main characters are great, and posses a surprising amount of personality and development.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: \\n\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed this anime from its interesting characters to its realistic narrative.  It managed to make me smile, tug at my heart, and overall, turned my bad days into good ones.  I recommend everyone to watch this show.",

            "content": "Life changing is how \u201cin-love\u201d feels in adolescence because it is a far more moving and compelling relationship than the young people have known before. The experience is all consuming and each is always on the other\u2019s mind. It is a merged relationship and each one feels part of the other, not quite whole when they are not together, especially when it comes to your first experience being in love. Tsuki ga Kirei (The Moon is Beautiful) is a touching romance tale that explores the many facets of love and strives to exemplify the beauty in simplicity while conveying both adolescence and realism. What makesthis show refreshing in this saturated genre is that it encapsulates a different kind of \u2018love\u2019 rarely seen, while awkwardly presented, it\u2019s taken the subject seriously\u2014the love that is kind and patient, that does not envy or boast, that bears all things, believes all things and endures all things. Warning, spoilers ahead!\\n\\n\r\nThe story follows our main protagonists, a young boy named Kotarou Azumi who is an inspiring writer and a young girl in Akane Mizuno, who is athletically gifted in Track events (running). The two find themselves worrying about their last year of middle school since the future remains unknown. When they find each other, however, they discover a whole new world that changes their lives for the better. Tsuki ga Kirei has a great finesse of visual storytelling\u2014it prioritizes displaying emotion over actually explaining it. This approach focuses more on the small precious moments, something as a simple as a smile, small gestures and thoughtful exchanges rather than big emotional melodramatic scenes, it\u2019s a realistic depiction of a first love relationship. Moments like Kotarou had to search the internet on what people do when they\u2019re dating, Akane making Kotarou a hand-knitted scarf, finding ways to spend more time alone together, or thinking about how to continue their relationship after middle-school\u2014it feels genuine, it feels real and progresses naturally throughout the story between the lovers since it more or less provides a powerful romance story from beginning to end.\\n\\n\r\nKotarou and Akane are two sides of the same coin. Kotarou lacks the self-esteem he needs to be more socially confident. Akane squeezes her plushie to calm her nerves whenever she's in a tense situation. Both keep to themselves and are generally quiet and polite people in their day-to-day activities. Most impressive to me is the phone messages sent between Kotarou and Akane. While struggling to talk to each other face-to-face at times, their interactions on their social media app (LINE) were completely different. These conversations were generally filled with confidence and energy. It didn't mean their shyness disappeared completely, it was blatantly obvious by their facial expressions and actions that the messages were often hard to send and waiting for a reply seemed agonising. Both of them would always be happy and excited whenever they got a response. Its such a joy to see their conversations online appeared to be very authentic and relatable. This is where Tsuki ga Kirei pulls an unexpected victory through its writing that moves the characters forward through realistic yet limited conversational dialogue. The show really knows how to make use of silence and stillness yet still captures the natural dialogue and emotion of teenagers amid family and friends. \\n\\n\r\nTsuki ga Kirei puts the young couple on a path for purposeful growth over the course of this touching romance tale. Part of their growth comes from a maturing of the adolescence they experience, failing within their respective goals and lastly, the influence and support from family and friends. Not only does this growth persists throughout the duration of the show but is also very significant since it adds towards the tones of realism. Akane and Kotarou are two teens who have reached a period in their lives where they are transitioning from young kids to young adults, and the director in Seijei Kishi understands that there isn\u2019t a need for anything complex or crazy for them to develop as characters, but rather these simple catalysts and each other. Their mutual love gives each other the motivation they need to succeed\u2014a classic example comes from their interactions together. Generally, they say very little out in public but they are so much more open when they are together in private and are able to hold much longer conversations with each other. When they show they're willing to fully express themselves to each other, it signals the positive essence of their love and relationship. As they slowly start to venture outside of their comfort zones, they're able to express their love more physically through holding hands, hugging and eventually kissing. \\n\\n\r\nAltogether, Kotarou and Akane\u2019s actions prove to be rewarding\u2014sincere love changes people for the better. Despite the trials and tribulations along the way, they overcome their self-esteem and anxiety issues because they walked through it together. Not only have they personally grown as individuals but their relationship has had an effective impact affecting them in a positive manner. One memorable challenge the couple had to face was having friends falling for them, in Takumi Hira and Nishio Chinatsu respectively. It makes sense as to why Takumi, (on the track team) naturally begins to admire Akane after years on the team, while Nishio\u2019s (also on the track team) consistent interactions with Kotarou and his bedhead change her thoughts on him completely. The eventual heartbreak for Takumi and Nishio is very tough and can hit home for a lot of viewers, but how it was handled was great. Most anime generally has the character who lost out feel unauthentic but Tsuki ga Kirei handles it proficiently well, and showing the repercussions as the anime went on was a nice touch, and only refers back to how realism is woven into every fabric of the story. Although they aren\u2019t developed much, they clearly belong to this universe.\\n\\n\r\nReally interesting to see that this is studio Feel\u2019s first original anime, and coming up with original titles, especially when it comes to romance, is really risky. Was it successful? It sure is! But when it comes to the art and animation, while great for the most part, there are a few hiccups here and there. Firstly, studio Feel goes for a more standard (but done well) designs for their characters, more in the same way that Mushishi does to give it more of an element of realism with only a few characters having distinctive anime troupe designs. Visually pretty with its well-detailed backgrounds and a more of a light and warm colour palette to give off a more, gentle appearance and serene atmosphere. The way that facial expressions and interpersonal actions are animated is done superbly. Great use of lighting and shot composition. In general, it has its moments of fluidity and maintains standard quality but there are also times where the production values take a hit. The cinematography suffers from the use of CG on civilians in the background, easily the biggest flaw in the entire show like you cannot un-see it. \\n\\n\r\nThe score is beautiful! It becomes one with all of the themes and the aesthetics of Tsuki ga Kirei. There\u2019s a great understanding of the use of the piano by perfectly balancing the harmonics with both bright and mellow tones which gives the anime added colour with a wide variety of harmonics to compliment the many emotions throughout the series. Other classical instruments, like acoustic guitar, violins and the harp playing not only set a happy and vibrant mood but introduces a high-level of elegance to some of the music for that magical and alluring effect in its delivery\u2014fitting the chemistry between Kotarou and Akane. There are a few insert songs but they are used appropriately in the given segments they are played in. The Opening \"Imakoko\" by Nao Touyama is full of energy and the Ending \"Tsuki ga Kirei\", also by Nao Touyama, take the emotional approach with its gentle and delicate use of vocals and classical instruments. Although a different subject I also really liked the extra side stories at the end of each episode after the Ending. The comedic vibes and the different pairing of characters were really fun, further showing us more of the side characters that don\u2019t get the shine time needed.\\n\\n\r\nTsuki ga Kirei is definitely a gem, a love letter to the romance genre, it simply accomplishes what many romance series fail to achieve and that\u2019s making all the simplicities in adolescence and falling in love accurately portrayed. It paints a more realistic and relatable love tale on our canvas without turning it into an out-of-control melodrama. The way the story ends is one of the best I have seen out of the genre, and it happens twice! We get an emotional scene that tugs on the heartstrings where Kotarou gives Akane a beautiful send-off and when the credits roll, we get to see panels of a happily-ever-after ending for the couple. It made the slow-pace journey worth it and more, proving a love story doesn\u2019t have to be complicated to be great. It's always the simple that produces the marvellous.\\n",

            "content": "We see a bunch of romantic anime every season, some with absurd history's, totally out of the reality. We just need a romantic genre more realistic, an anime we see ourselves there, our life, our love, our own history.\r\nI had a lot of hopes with Tsuki ga Kirei, fortunately, all of them was completed. The synopsis was very catchy for me, and me as romantic anime fan, I couldn't lose this. \r\nI think I can describe it like \"simple\". This is the magic with TgK, a history we can see every day, a history that we lived in the past, or that we're living now.Those moments that we became shy with with the person that we like, the online messages, a more simply and pure love... all of this make this a great anime.\\n\\n\r\nSo, my notes:\\n\\n\r\nStory: This is the point! A simple history, just great. (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nArt: It's a point this anime unfortunately went down. The background CG's didn't disturb me, but I think it's a point that can improve, also, the design of the characters with that \"withe detail\", could improve too. (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nSound: No doubts, they did a great work here. The OSTs are very beautiful and the opening and ending... I don't have words... just listen. (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Well, they are great, but sometimes they did things... WOW? NO MAN, DO IT, DON'T STAY THERE, GO! I think it can improve some of his actions. (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This story reflected a part of my life, and appeared in a very propitious moment. (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall: If you're not too critic with the art, and appreciate a \"simple\" romantic history, go watch Tsuki ga Kirei!",

            "content": "'Tsuki ga kirei' ... \"The moon is beautiful\" This is a well known Japanese saying that also serves as a confession of 'I love you'. It is a representation of how true love between two people transcends simple words. This anime tells a heartwarming tale of a love that didn't need a white knight or an overly charismatic gigolo. In a sense, it was love in its purest form. The anime captures the essence of romance simply through the expressions of the characters, their posture, and their fidgeting. Watching the two inexperienced lovers, you can't help but cheer for them.\r\nWe don't all live in thefantasy dream-like romantic school life that a lot of romance anime seems to always use, but that doesn't mean that there isn't love to be found in everyday life. Whether it be a fleeting glance or a comedic emoji sticker sent via a messaging app, there is meaning in these seemingly insignificant events, just like how the simple phrase 'the moon is beautiful' can be a confession of love.\\n\\n\r\nThe music and art are simple, fitting right with the theme of the show. Tsuki ga Kirei is not about the ostentatious and the extraordinary aspects of romance. It's about the charm of even the simplest aspects, and the music and art is there to share that, not hot the spotlight.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps one might find this too idealistic and nobody could blame them. For us in the real world, our mistakes, inexperience, and life circumstances may prevent us from ever experiencing the ideal fairytale. However, Tsuki ga Kirei provided a heartwarming tale with flying colors, and I'm glad to have gone through its journey.",

Well, from the date of my review and if you include other genres, of course, we would have wotakoi, Tada-kun wa Koi wo Shinai, Net-juu no Susume, Just Because!, and of course not missing out SukaSuka. Among all these, in my honest opinion, Tsuki ga Kirei is on its own caliber at the top of the list.\\n\\n\r\nThe last time few pure romance anime I enjoyed were in 2016 (when I finished Kimi ni Todoke), 2014 (referring to Ao Haru Ride and Golden Time). 2013 (and Sukitte Ii na yo.). While these are good anime, however, none of these are on par with Tsuki ga Kirei. The true romance that could equally match with Tsuki ga Kirei are finite and could be counted with fingers (of my own awareness).\\n\\n\r\n>>Content<<\\n\r\nHow did the beauty of this piece of work entice upon its audience? We have to look through the progression of the characters and the beauty of the work. Tsuki ga Kirei expresses the unique features, personality, and emotions of each character carefully and showcase their forte. The story is rather simple without much complication but it has delivered a perfectly simple story that was encased with a somewhat bittersweet peculiar romance touch.\\n\\n\r\nEvery episode was essential in building up its development to its destination at a perfect pace. Each circumstance and situations that have been experienced illustrate the meaning of their life. You could perceive that every moment is a requisite and it helps the audience to feel the involvement of the characters. There are times you could think how the male protagonist is so cool while sometimes how the female protagonist did the right choice. It could be concluded that every fragment are equally prominent and after placed in the right spot would result in this perfect piece of work.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, like most others, it has its own twists and, in this case, you might have to rely on their faith and beliefs including their own interpersonal skills to move on to the best resulting pairings that you may desire.\\n\\n\r\nAnd not forgeting the music, soundtracks and songs coupled with appropriate scenes created by the Feel Studio to produce sufficient feels (pun intended).\\n\\n\r\n>>Conclusion<<\\n\r\nI'm aware that we have different reactions to different perspective. As such, this review is wholely personalized and is only of my own opinion. Please take this as a two cents view. However, if you haven't watch it yet, I would strongly recommend this show for your own benefits.",

            "content": "In Spring 2017, I've discovered my favorite romance anime to date.\r\n I have legitimately never ever seen a romance anime presented with such a grounded yet extremely gripping atmosphere throughout its entire runtime.\r\nThis is a \"first love\" story - the most simple of concepts, yet apparently so hard to pull in this medium.\r\n Tsuki ga Kirei shines in highlighting the little things that light up the torch of love in teen years: from the most basic act of making constant eye contact with that cute person in our class, to get the guts to finally say anything to them, fighting the daily struggle ofnot stopping thinking about their smile, punishing ourselves emotionally for not having the initiative to ask them out, finally getting around to do it, realizing how their presence and attention alone can bring inspiration to do what we love the most with the best efficiency possible since we don't want to let them down in any way... All these things have been seen in romance anime before in one way or another, but Tsuki ga Kirei is the only one I've witnessed pulling them (and more) in such a focused manner, without ever being overdramatic and constantly grounded to reality. \\n\\n\r\n This sense of identity the characters have bring about how real they feel, and thus, how their emotions feel all that more relatable, and, if not that, at least very believable.\\n\\n\r\n There are things that make this stand out from the crowd in an even more distinct way, in case the aforementioned points didn't convince you.\\n\r\nSomething as simple as exchanging messages with our loved one may bring us the biggest smile in our life; it may give us a burst of energy to start working and harder than ever before; and situations as pure and relatable as writing in a message our true feelings about a bad situation only to then delete the whole thing and instead say something as \"alright, sleep well\" really hit home and show the characters' feelings in an effortless, natural way.\\n\\n\r\n As a last note, I can say that every single episode had at least one extremely thrilling moment (for better or for worse to my heart) that kept me at the edge of my seat and honestly cheering for a relationship like I'd never done before. Something bad that I can point out about Tsuki ga Kirei? Only one: the background / crowd characters' CGI was terribly distracting in the first half of the show, but it was at least toned down in the second half.\\n\\n\r\n Things that feel like basic romance development elements are nowadays ignored and either replaced by a COMEDY, HAREM or ECCHI tag, but Tsuki ga Kirei grabs all of those seemingly lost / forgotten elements and not only executes them all at once, but does so in such a perfect, realistic, heartfelt and satisfying way.\\n\\n\r\n A first love is something that might change us permanently, and all the seemingly little memories that we make with it will carry on with us to the rest of our lives, regardless of its outcome, as the moon, so beautiful.\\n",

            "content": "I wanted to love it but I ended up hating it. Where does one begin when they want to talk about something that fills them with a complete contradiction? The answer is I don't really know.\r\nSo, as a means to start this review I'll get the informal non-explanatory part out of the way:\r\nI am extremely pissed off. Never have I been so god damn irritated at a show in almost its entirety.\r\nAnd, as someone who is a bit of a sucker for a good romance, why am I so aggrieved at something which many consider a masterpiece in the genre? The simplest answer I cangive is that from my perspective, the strengths of this show also happen to be its downfall.\\n\\n\r\nFirst ask yourself the question - what is the main strength of this show? For those who haven't seen it and don't know the answer, it's realism. It makes an attempt at portraying an extremely real-life scenario: no fan service, no dumb scenes spoiled for comedic effect, no obvious archetypes. Just a bunch of awkward teenagers being awkward teenagers and struggling to deal with lovey-dovey feelings.\\n\\n\r\nI don't know about you but I would consider this a plus, and to be fair most of the cast are brilliantly done in this regard. My issue however lies with the two main characters of the show - Kotarou and Akane.\\n\\n\r\nI'll be frank: never do these two display any sort of chemistry and it never feels like they're in a relationship until it's far too late to matter. Both characters display elements of realism that make sense but let's be real here: Kotarou asks Akane out on a whim despite not knowing very much about her because he fancies her and she says yes because she clearly fancies him as well. But they spend the entire time being awkward - they don't tell anyone, they hardly speak in each other's physical presence and no one really realises because the way they act they might as well not even be in a relationship. If half the characters in the show can't tell, how am I supposed to believe that they're really together?\\n\\n\r\nI'd probably describe it as realism gone too far. The reason most shows are not portrayed in complete realism is because if they were they would be boring - no one wants to watch the monotony of everyday people. This is essentially how I feel - the majority of their interactions together are dull and I struggle to root for their romance when it never feels like they belong together. I guess the 8.40 average rating at the time of writing is testament against this but it's a mostly true statement (about why shows aren't portrayed with ultra realism) and I'm simply writing how I feel. There are certainly those who think otherwise.\\n\\n\r\nI mean you know, I want them to be awkward but romantically awkward. I want them to spend all their time together and actually acknowledge each other around other human beings, not blatantly ignore each other until they're completely alone. Just personal idealism I suppose, but nonetheless representative of why it annoyed me. I want romance from my romance, not awkward nonsense with forced tearjerker moments to try and make me feel like they're being romantic.\\n\\n\r\nIt also meant that the tearjerkers towards the end didn't pack the punch they should've done. I really, really wanted to get into them but I couldn't because of the aforementioned reasons. Sitting through it I felt as if I was wasting my time.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I don't particularly feel like the show is bad. I've given it a 5 after all not a 1. I just came out of it highly unsatisfied and wishing what could have been, thinking about how I would have loved those tearjerkers had I gotten into the characters.\\n\\n\r\nFair play to everyone who enjoyed it though. Everyone has their own opinions after all and I don't want to take issue with them. Just because I didn't love it doesn't mean others won't. \\n\\n\r\nTry not to feel put off by anything I've said - if you're interested, give it a go. At the end of the day, it stands about above a lot of the crap considered \"romance anime\". I'm just here to offer a slightly different perspective from the majority for anyone who might be interested. Feel free to disagree and/or discuss anything I've written about with me.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for taking the time to read this and have a nice day.",

Don't give up even if you fail. Family, Friends, and yourself is hope. Sometimes influences your life.\r\nWhat's the answer? Haha. I don't have a say. It is no matter if we have not the thing. Once Again. It depends on you.\r\nI said bossy a lot so far though, my school life was irrelevant to love. I'm a introvert at that time, and I always head in the clouds. I hated myself.\r\nPeople who changed such myself were...undeniablymy family. They wrapped shy human like me gently. Ah, about kindness is the thing. I realized clearly.\\n\r\nI'm glad if there is person same with me. The reason is that I can sympathize him or her. Sympathy is very important. From there we become kind to someone.\\n\r\nMeeting and parting is coming up quickly. School Time, The flow of the times. Time is passing. It don't start life again. It's honest.\\n\r\nThen, I'll bring down long preface, I talk about this show. Tsuki ga Kirei. This show is amazing.\\n\\n\r\nMain Protagonist, Kotarou Azumi is very ordinary junior high school student. He is a literature club captain, and he aim at novelist like certain celebrity.\\n\r\nAkane Mizuno is Main Heroine. She is a track and field club member, and she have been achieved excellent grades.\\n\r\nOne day, Kotarou meets Akane in a certain event, and they are aware of each other. This matter is involved in story.\\n\r\nAlthough I has affirmed, It's not just Love Romance. Purity and awkward, I don't know why but it can grin. Just like pure love.\\n\r\nIf generic romance shows, repeating slapstick and muddy by love triangle are obvious though, this show's case is different.\\n\r\nKotarou and Akane's love pattern are depicting in earnest, direct front, serious. There are also pointing out about too realistic, but that's true for sure.\\n\r\nThat's why you made me feel like cheer Kotarou and Akane. It is happiness for me to doing it.\\n\r\nThey have many friends. Everyone never say fulfilling though, they have been tried for the future without insatiable.\\n\r\nAhead of dazzling sun, group of birds got together, and flap blue sky. Please imagine such a spectacle.\\n\r\nFriendship is noble, but love is more sour-sweet. Maybe It is better than valuables.\\n\r\nI think that people who actually experienced it understand though, it can't be dealt with easily. As I said this.\\n\r\nYou've been see that person's happy faces and sad faces. Sharing with each other also important. If more love sprout, I would feel the same way even more.\\n\\n\r\nIt's tend to attention Kotarou and Akane's relationship though, you should focus other characters dialogue. Unexpected development also await.\\n\r\nKotarou often adduce celebrity quotes during a show. When I have to talk this show, this point also important part.\\n\r\nAkane actives in track and field with twists and turns, and she struggles in her way. Except club, she works through various troubles, but it is same with Kotarou.\\n\r\nBecause of internal surface depicting politely, this show characters are quite likable. I'm type who have empathy for male protagonist. Kotarou is my favorite character.\\n\r\nShort part insert after original story. This short also interesting. Soften atmosphere who feel comfortable from the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation has transparency. In other words, this is very beautiful. Sometimes quality is falling, but I don't care about it.\\n\r\nPopular illustrator \"loundraw\" character design and visual colorize this show's world-view, too.\\n\r\nThis person is doing unmatched activity in various field. If you interested in this person, you can check it out.\\n\\n\r\nI like this show's music. Especially Nao Touyama's OP and ED songs, insert songs are very good.\\n\r\nThis show made me I became fan of Nao. Her voice is truly attractive. Whenever I listen to her songs, I'm depurate. Like goddess of song have descended.\\n\r\nIt seems that this show is her debut single. She've been sing character songs in the past. The ability is unfathomable.\\n\\n\r\nThe only flaw is meaninglessness of title. This show's title definitely one of theme. But it isn't emphasize.\\n\\n\r\nUnrequited love to mutual feeling's expansion likely with puberty. Not technique likely it, and This show is expressed delicately by unique technique about anime.\\n\r\nThis show is awesomely great. High perfection with almost everything. Impenetrable scenes aren't exist at all. I'm so satisfied.\\n\r\nI watched anime who I've never seen even once in my life. Last episode is touching.\\n\r\nAs myself, I regret the thing that didn't have an interest against love until now. This show is thought-provoking.\\n\r\nI bought this show's Complete Series after a few months. I love this show so much. I want to keep close to this show.",

            "content": "Tsuki ga Kirei, labeled as another school romance anime, didn't appear to be the standout of the season. Based on original work and plagued with production issues, it was considered to be the wild card of the season as no one knew what would happen. That said, this was easily the standout of the season for me and the anime that I would always look forward to most throughout the week. While nothing particularly special happens, it is within the simplicity of the show that shines.\r\nThe story: While not being elaborate or different, amazed me with how realistic and relatable the situations were. The twomain characters with different things going on in their lives develop feelings for each other. Such a premise is so simple but this anime captures everything a middle-school student would feel. In middle school, you are still adjusting and learning to become more mature and adult-like. The awkwardness and nervousness they feel when they encounter new experiences such as love and relationships are displayed in a way that is relatable but not uncomfortable. The pacing is well done but plays out slowly, much like most other school romance anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe art: What looks nice is subjective to you. Instead I can only tell you what I thought of it. The 2.5D art style looked well done to me. The best and most easy comparison is to Makoto Shinkai's works, although not to that quality. Nonetheless, I found it nice to look at. There were some parts where I heard discussion about poor animation and the use of cgi, but I didn't catch it so I can't verify any weak points in the art or animation.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound: I found that all the voices fit well. All the emotions that needed to be captured through dialogue were conveyed and their feelings. Between the opening and ending, they fit with the overall tone. The real strength in sound were the insert tracks. Always timed well, fitting the tone and not being overbearing. Basically everything you'd want from your soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters: Because of the simplistic story, a lot of pressure is put on the characters to feel and make the story work. Luckily, they all followed the story perfectly. The two main characters, as I've highlighted before, struggle with balancing new experiences in their daily life and it is clearly shown through actions, thoughts, dialogue and texts how they feel and the nervousness of new experiences. Chinatsu and Hira, the love obstacles of sorts, are both dealt with well. Without going into too much drama, their feelings are displayed and their actions match with what kids their age would do. Even though they are put in to disrupt the two's relationship, I sympathized with them while being happy that they failed to break apart Kotarou and Akane. The side characters are also worth a mention. Due to the immaturity and inexperience of Kotarou and Akane, the adults and older figures in their lives (more in Kotarou's life) play the role of mentor, giving advice and guiding the younger, less knowledgeable kids through new challenges. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: If it wasn't abundantly clear, I love this anime. The experiences were relatable and it is the runaway best anime of the season for me. \\n\r\nenjoyment factors (some may be repeated from above) could be:\\n\r\n+ cuteness, I found myself squealing whenever they did something couple or relationship-like\\n\r\n+ realism and relatability\\n\r\n+ uses good symbolism\\n\r\n+ likeable characters\\n\r\n+ good pacing\\n\r\n+ relationship that progresses throughout the story\\n\r\n+ soundtrack\\n\r\n+ art\\n\r\n+ drama progresses story, no pointless drama\\n\r\n - some episodes delayed due to production issues (you don't have to worry about that now!)\\n\r\n - If you don't like school romance anime\\n\r\n - If you didn't like any of the positives listed\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I have said multiple times I think this is anime of the season, maybe anime of the year depending on what else we get in 2017. Even if you don't think it's as good as I say, I think that this anime is at least worth a try.",

To be blunt  I saw the first episode and I thought is was going to be a disaster seeing how much they. Instead , they showed a beautiful yet very realistic story about a couple , their first love and their progress.I liked the fact that cliches were avoided. Indeed reflecting on it  I will say it's a good watch and worth your time. People who found it while looking for \"Big obstacle\" inpath of love or princesses/princes coming to peek you up  would be very disappointed . But if you are here looking for a good story or if you have experienced a childhood first love then this is the right anime for you\\n\\n\r\nWithout any doubt it has its fair share of flaws.The animation was simply bad . While the art in each scene was done very well the overall joining of the pieces was not very good. But in light of such a great story and wonderfully pacing it can easily go unnoticed",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS. I don't think I could express how much I feel about this if I don't...\r\nHey all. This is my first time writing a review for an anime. Usually I would just watch from the shadows, but this show really made me want to share how I feel about it. Simple enough, I loved it. \r\nI feel like there are so many great anime out there that simply don't have enough episodes to make a satisfying story that can really touch viewers. That gives Tsuki ga Kirei an advantage, since it was an original anime. It had the freedom to go atits own pace, and I think that really makes this show shine. I've watched too many romance where there's very little progression in the relationship, but this anime was different. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nThe show had solid romance in my opinion, and even with hindrances to the relationship, the story progressed and helped develop the characters. The story is also definitely not cliche at all, which is a plus considering how many romance anime I've watched in my lifetime.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nWhile the show was incredible, the art was definitely not top-notch. That's not saying that there weren't some incredibly beautiful scenes in it. The first episode showed me how great the visuals of the anime looked with cherry blossom leaves falling on a Japanese setting. But, the CG. Oh my lord the CG looked horrible to me. Personally, 3D anime is not something I like at all, even if it has good execution, so that's a me-thing that really turned me off about the anime. Even though it's prevalent in like every episode, it wasn't a deterrent for the important parts of the episode (thankfully in 2D), so I was still able to love the show. (If you're a 3D fan sorry!)\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nRight after I finished the show, I found myself humming one of the main BGM, which just shows how melodic the music was for me. The music is nice, though I wouldn't say it's the most memorable since I quickly forgot them thereafter. But, there were some clarinet BGM, and as a clarinet player myself, that's a plus!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nProbably the best part of the show. Lots of other anime have the trap of not being able to relate with their viewers. This show did not have that problem. The character interactions felt so realistic, and I could see myself rooting for Akane and Kotarou while feeling empathetic towards Chinatsu and Takami (since I have unrequited love too lol). I loved the characters, and even some of the side characters stuck out to me because of the really funny short clips that followed some of the episodes (and even got its own OVA!)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: 10 (SPOILER)\\n\r\nEven though the show had some flaws (the CG...), it was still an incredible watch for me. Few anime have been able to make me feel emotional, and a scene where Kotarou's mom stayed up late making Kotarou's dinner to support her son even though she disagreed with him really hit me hard since it reminded me of my own mother. Simple scenes like that completely changed my experience from being good to great. Akane and Kotarou's relationship also made me smile so much because of how innocent it was. The growth of their relationship and differences as characters really elevated my overall enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nDefinitely suggest this if you're looking for a great romance anime. It made it to my top 10 anime too, which could show how much I liked this show.",

            "content": "I have to say; looking at this anime and reading the synopsis for the first time, I didn't really expect anything out of it; another cluttered anime filled with repetitive cliches and a bad storyline was what I thought at the time.\r\n       After watching just a few episodes, I felt like it was everything I've ever looked for in a romance anime; a depiction of young love that feels real, the awkwardness and tension you can cut with a knife; it was definitely worth every second. This was definitely my AoTS, and is probably one of the best animes,if not THE best romance anime I've watched storywise.\\n\r\n    Looking at the anime itself, I definitely enjoyed the story to the point where I felt like I was indulging myself too much. The realism this anime brings to the table as opposed to other anime in the same genre was fairly mindblowing in my opinion; it seemed like this type of story could actually be plausible in real life. Their young romance seemed refreshing; and the incorporation of side-characters (their parents, friends, etc.), as well as other irrelevant-seeming factors (the use of LINE) gave it an even more realistic feeling for me.\\n\r\n      The art was probably what turned me off a little bit from the anime. Don't get me wrong; the scenery and relevant characters looked good for the most part, but what really turned me off were the CGI characters that looked like walking zombies just weaving in and out of the background. Other than that, I really don't have any complaints about the art.\\n\r\n     The sound, or maybe I should call it the lack of sound, is also one of Tsuki ga Kirei's redeeming qualities. The already prevalent tension and awkwardness in the story you could easily cut with a knife is strengthened by the intentionally placed moments of silence for extended periods of time. What's more, is that they also add in a plethora of realistic humanlike sounds like grunts, moans, sighs, etc. in order to emphasize the use of silence throughout this anime.\\n\r\n   Both of the characters, Kotarou and Akane, were what I felt like to be prime examples of young love in anime. Their awkwardness when they first meet, the developing and blossoming of their relationship and the embarrassing moments they share throughout the anime make it all the more enjoyable to watch. Being able to cringe (in a good way) and share the characters feelings as the story goes on is a very important part for me in a romance anime, and if you share the same feelings as I do this will definitely be worthwhile to watch.\\n\r\n      Overall, I think this anime was one of the more hidden, underrated romance animes of 2017. Not expecting anything out of it, but getting everything in return was one of the most pleasant surprises I received while watching it back then. I gave this an overall 10/10; if you enjoy romance and slice of life anime as much as I do, then the story, the plot, the characters, and just the realism of it will blow you away.\\n",

            "content": "I originally began watching Tsuki ga Kirei because of the unique art style which really piqued my interest.  But as time went on what had started as a simple school romance series quickly evolved into much more.  I found myself deeply immersed in the story and the hopes of the main characters.  While on the surface the series may seem simple the true beauty is expressed in the subtleties.  \r\nThe pleasant art style matches the story being told perfectly.  The story had enough new elements that it never felt cliche or predictable.  No conflict felt forced or out ofplace.  However, the main highlight for me were the characters.  The fantastic voice-acting brings the characters seemingly to life and makes conversations seem warm and inviting.  Little mannerisms are shown with each character such as facial expressions or nervous fidgeting which helps to make the characters feel like real people experiencing emotions we've all had.  Each character's personality and priorities developed over time and helped the viewer understand who they truly are.\\n\\n\r\nAbove all, I'd say Tsuki ga Kirei was a masterpiece for my taste.  Everything about it had me coming back for more and while the ending was complete, I was still slightly upset that the series had to end.  This series is an easy 10 and i'd recommend it to anyone that's interested in the genre.",

Whenever you are ready for a calming anime that takes on the school romance genre, then Tsuki ga Kirei is there ready to take you in for a wonderful story about the innocent side of love.\r\nTwo young teenagers, both strangers, noticed each other in their classroom. A bit of a push there and a pull here, and their romantic journey set off in the breeze. The story took on a realistic yet simple take to develop the relationship between thesetwo students. As they are still young people, the awkwardness of being in the presence of one another and the uncertainty of how to handle from here on out was refreshing to say the least. In short, there were no forced progression. The character development to learn their blossoming love had a good pacing that's not too fast nor too slow, all the way up to a satisfying ending. Other aspects were also present in the story such as the use of a messaging app (LINE) which reinforces the modern and realistic narrative, and then there were the family and ambition subplot in the mix too. These helped in telling a different perspective on their love life, not only because they shifted the focus to other things that we all experienced in our personal life, they also added drama into the story. Thankfully, no heavy drama were present as it was simply not needed to engage the audience with emotions. A mere natural human feeling can be enough to do the trick and this anime executed it well when the characters expressed their own feelings in handling some of the obstacles they faced. Though there were some characters that were not needed, it wasn't enough to take away from the focus on the main relationship.\\n\\n\r\nArt style nailed in giving the modern look of a Japanese suburb. It wasn't fancy, but the peacefulness gave the story a more pleasant experience. While some scenes did look clumsy animation-wise, particularly in the CGI and running/walking sections, overall, the movements suited the atmosphere the anime had going on. Strong white highlights in the hair conveyed an innocent, almost child-like, desire for a yearning love. It established the learning attitude of young people and this time, it's in the curiosity of a romantic relationship and how one should go about it. The audio part didn't really stand out compared to the story except for the fact that they were soothing. But in the last few episodes, the use of insert songs really did bring out the emotions within me. Basically, they complemented well with the scenes at the end of each episode. I also wanted to bring out that I found the 'Huh's and 'Ah's and 'Uh's of the main couple to be purely adorable to hear, even though it was a recurring thing. They were cute during their interactions with one another, making me smile everytime I see these scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSimpleness might not be a thing for everyone, but a consistent and heartwarming romantic story like Tsuki ga Kirei is enjoyable to watch, even if it's on a one episode every two or so days basis. It's an honest narrative about a developing love between two young teens, a straightforwardly beautiful experience.",

            "content": "Wow! Just wow! Amazing! I actually cried at the very end of this series. It's so BEAUTIFUL! This is a masterpiece! No doubt one of the best anime slice of life i have ever seen! Okay here we go with the review!\r\nStory: Holy Smokes! Wow! Kodus to the author or creator of this anime, we are very humbled to see such beautiful work!\r\nThe story starts with our 2 very awkward protagonists, whom, for the  very 1st time got into the same class on the last year of their junior high, and as time goes by their love grows slowly along with trials and tempations,1st was only eye contact 2nd bumping to each and slowly talking to each other getting closer bit by bit and so on. The story is very well put, its slow but its not that slow thay you'll get bored of redundancy or cliche scenes, every scene is unpredictable. Wow. This deserves a live action already i definitely wanna watch it. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: hohoho! Its very unique and quite beautiful actually, i love how cute they made the character designs, it is flawless! The animation on the other hand is also good! Some cgi's though are not very smooth but naah... who cares! Backgrounds looks awesome!\\n\r\nI love how the art depicts real life movements and emotions, i can clearly see it, some scenes made me cry \ud83d\ude2d 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: Sound wow, it adds to the hype! At first it didn't get through me but on the last part were they showed the after shots, gives it a more emotional ride, you know when you feel something weird inside your heart and a good music plays along makes you feel all mixed up inside... That's how good it is.. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: ohohoho. Love it love it love it! Love all of them! All of them have their moments! From the main characters to the side characters they all have their own spotlights. There is nothing about them that you should hate all of them are cool and very very relatable! Good to see a male protagonist who is not a self centered jerk or a selfless wanna be, the kid is just a plain old normal boy who's going through his adolescent life. Female protagonist is also really good! She's shy yes but not the tsundere type or a yandere type or whatever shes the most closest thing ever to a real live woman! 10/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Did i or did i not enjoy this? Ofcourse i enjoyed it, this is gonna be listed as one of my top 10 must rewatch anime, it's cool, it's fresh, it's relatable and the ending makes you wanna cry with ahemmmm.... You must find out for yourself! \ud83d\ude02 Everything in it is very good! Btw i binged the whole thing, and i don't usually do that if the anime sucks! But this one is really good! 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: uhhh, the whole thing is a masterpiece, at first i had my doubts about this. I thought its gonna be borring but i was wrong, taken me a whole year to watch this btw, and i kinda regret why i didn't watch it sooner.. but still i manage to watch the whole thing in just one night, and its definitely worth it! very very highly recommendable for those who like slice of life with a spice of romance out there! You don't wanna miss this one! 10/10. Thank you anime Jesus for guiding us to this beautiful anime! Hope you guide us to another one! Thanks!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Dazai once said: [What uneasiness lies in being loved.]\r\nTsuki ga Kirei is a romance show that airied in Spring 2017, and after finishing it, I can only say one thing with absolute certainty: This show is by far one of the greatest romance shows I have ever watched. \r\nDuring the time this was airing, waiting to watch this show has made me feel unreasonable amounts of anxiety; never have I felt like this with any other show.\r\n==Story\r\nTsuki ga Kirei is a show that revolves around our awkward duo, Akane and Kotarou and how they handle their lives during middle school all the way up tograduation. It's a simple tale with no quirks. These are simply normal people living their normal lives.\\n\\n\r\nThat's all I can say since anything beyond this is spoiler territory. Anyway, the storyline of TgK all the way up to the end has consistently remained realistic and grounded. It is a modest middleschool romance story that explores the school and romantic lives of our couple. \\n\\n\r\nSome characters act like idiots and they fight over the most puzzling of things, but the show takes time for you to remember that these are middleschoolers that doesn't have alot of experience with that sort of thing.\\n\\n\r\n==Art\\n\r\nTgK has this wonderful coloring that reminds me of Grimgar's watercolour-style. The way the characters look are a bit quirky and rough at times but it's nothing really serious.\\n\\n\r\nThe only downside of this are the poor CGI models of unimportant characters (crowds). They look extremely out of place, but it's something you can ignore as you truck through the show.\\n\\n\r\n==Sounds\\n\r\nNot much to say here, since the OST didn't really catch my ear = It's average. The OP and ED however are absolutely fantastic. \\n\\n\r\n==Characters\\n\r\nWatching these characters reminds me alot of my middleschool days and it frightens me of how accurate these people are. They don't feel like characters in a show, they feel like actual people with how they talk and move. \\n\\n\r\nAs for our main couple, they developed into better people as they go on, from awkward teenagers into awkward teenagers with a heart. The way they interact with their rivals could be described as nothing short of really frustrating, but you need to remember that these are awkward teens, which in turn makes them characters I legitimately care about.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, watching Akane and Kotarou grow and mature felt about as heartwaming as watching my friends succeed in life (and about as depressing knowing I would never achieve the same.)\\n\\n\r\n==Enjoyment\\n\r\nEvery awaiting episode filled me with nothing but worry and anxiety. I could never predict properly what was going on since this show literally throws tropes out of the window. This show is literally Middleschool Romance: The Anime.\\n\\n\r\nSo watching them handle their school and romantic problems in ways I would never anticipate (thanks, tropes) always left me with a warm heart, but the way they concluded each problem was never so complete that you would feel completely free.\\n\\n\r\nThat is, until the last episode. Definitely ranks high into one of the most satisfying endings in romance anime.\\n\\n\r\n==Overall\\n\r\nWatch it. If you're a huge fan of the romance genre, watch it. But if you don't like slow moving anime, I would ask you to get second opinions.",

Although at first, the main character, male and female, were not out standing (and I thought of not memorable types), plus the not-so-nice artwork, the development of the characters are sweet. The young love was depicted as pure and, somewhat, dumb, but for no reason, it was real. Itdoes remind me so much to the time when I first know what love is, with the bitter-sweet taste and some regrets.\\n\r\nThe music for this anime is great, I love all the songs, as they fitted well with the scene. they messed well and become a booster for emotion when the two character interact.

Pass.\" But then I watched it when a friend recommended it to me. The story is simple enough to understand and the pacing is impressive, I am astounded at the fact that it isn't rushed. I'll give it a 10/10.\r\nArt - The art style is unique but I totally love it. I don't find the character designs odd or anything, for me,it's beautiful along with the realistic effects. This is not the type of anime where if someone cries, tears just fall down. No. This is the type of anime that is created with emotion and effort. This is created to make you feel like you're the character. 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound - Wow. This is the only anime I've watched that has background music executed perfectly depending on the scene. The music is like an angel singing gracefully next to your ear. It's perfect. 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - Do you want a character that makes the right decisions no matter what happens? Watch Tsuki ga Kirei. Their decisions are so good that I actually wanted them to make a mistake and see what would happen. Every character in the anime is likable. The chemistry is so good. These are the types of characters that you will never ever forget. 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - Hell, I enjoyed it. I was sad when this ended. I always get thrilled and excited every time an episode ends. My heart constantly begs for more. Every episode, the anime's likability rises tremendously. 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10/10. I won't forget this anime. Makes me smile every time.",

Features very relatable characters added the fact that I've personally experienced most of these thing growing up helped in connecting to these character on an emotional level.\r\nThe anime focuses on the budding love story between two young and inexperienced middle school students, Azumi and Akane, that stand out to me because the execution and build up of these two characters over the course ofthe 10 current episodes felt so genuine and I deeply felt like i NEEDED to root for them and see that they stay together till the end. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, one of my favorite anime of this season and truly an underrated standout, I fully recommend it to anyone with a soft spot for a realistic portrayal of romance and life in general",

I would recommend this anime if you\u2019re looking a romance anime this season. It\u2019s definitely worth the watch and I believe most people interested in the romance genre will find something in this anime.\r\nThe animation is nothing special and the CG students can get distracting, but it looks great where it matters. The characters are frustratingly relatable as most of us can remember how awkward we were at their age. How the main characters interact is so modern andcute, they are quite embarrassed in person, but feel completely comfortable via text message. Some may say it\u2019s a slow plot, and although a lot is happening, it feels grounded by their personal conflict to get past their awkwardness. I find this to be a strength, but I can understand if others find it slow.\\n\\n\r\nThe journey of young love is one we can all remember and wondering where it\u2019ll end up for the leads is what will keep you hooked. Solid anime.\\n",

            "content": "I think this is a 13 episode anime if I am not mistaken, so I think I can write a review.\r\nStory (9) - I really like this story. In Tsuki ga Kirei, an older way to say I love you in Japanese, is quite the romance. It is a kind of pure and simple romance, and for me at least, it reminds me of my younger days. Back then, I'd fall in love with people without knowing too much about them. I would say that I was a young fool, but in doing so, my life was so simplistic. Azumi is trying to please thegirl he likes, and he finds courage to work hard to please her. This is anime is soo perfect on describing middle school life nowadays! With the cellphone hiding from others, the activity on the trip, mean best friends peeking into your line chat, and the stay allnighters deceiving the teachers on trips at hotels. \\n\\n\r\nArt (10) - Not much to say here. I love how simplistic the animation is, for me, the more realistic the animation is, the more I like it. Oregairu, White Album 2, Kuzu no Honkai, and the like are other such anime whose art I rate extremely high. \\n\\n\r\nSound (10) - Imakoko is my new favorite song this season! I think that the opening highlights what this anime is about, a rather quiet opening part, followed by an exponential increase in volume, just like the peak years of middle school. It ends on a rather positive vibe, so I assume that the anime may end that way as well (I could be wrong, I have been many times). I do not really have an opinion about the ending.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10) - Simplicity is sometimes the best. Being young and less knowledgeable, that is exactly what Akane and Azumi are. Quick, assuming, shy, and extremely nervous around the other gender. Both of them are a match made in heaven, if ever I saw one. Azumi looks as though he wishes to be a writer, and he is motivated by even a single text by Akane. It is rather saddening, however, due to his shyness, he lacks the courage to progress (at least so far) with a friendship with Akane. Akane is also kind of the same, she knows she has feelings for him (episode 4 when the girls are together on their phones in the dark), but yet she lacks the courage to confront her friends to let her go on her own to meet him. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10) - I really enjoy this. No matter that lame 7.48 rating, and yet SAO has a 9.whatever, I think that this should be rated much higher. I enjoy simple (and sometimes complex) romances, as romance comes in all shapes forms and sizes. Sometimes it is simple, unrequited, comedic, etc. Tsuki ga Kirei is rather simple; but yet, that is the one I prefer the most. True, episode 4 foreshadowed some possible future difficulties with their relationship, but like I say, you can't reach the rose if you don't go through the thorns. Even though a lot of these episodes end on cliffhangers, I enjoy it nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (10) - Everybody can ding me for rating an anime a 10, I really am not that judgmental. A lot of anime here have much higher ratings due to being mainstream, and yet the people who didn't understand what Kuzu no Honkai was about kept dinging it with 7s because they don't understand romance. I would recommend this anime to everybody, really, you can't get a more accurate depiction of young romance.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Introduction\r\nI've just finished watching Tsuki no Kirei and I have to say, this is one of the best shows I have watched, in my opinion, it rivals even Clannad/Clannad After Story with its romance/school crossover, the emotions that it unleashes through your body makes you want to keep watching it, within about two minutes I was on google searching if there was a second season, though, I found that it was only aired in April so it's not surprising that there isn't a season two yet but I can only say, I pray for the announcement.\r\nThe school genre overall is used quite a lot andfor the reason that a few of them aren't very good because nothing really happens to get your blood pumping or you can just read through everything, sometimes, a story comes out that really drags you into the show. Tsuki ga Kirei does just that. Every time I told myself something would happen, the authors turned around and corrected me. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned above, the story was simply beautiful. It seemed quite realistic and had both it's happy, and sad moments, which were structured so amazingly that it rivals some of the other shows which are much more well-known. I can really tell the writers thought out every aspect of the story and executed it brilliantly. Not only was there Romance and School but there were also other pieces like the characters struggling through their relationship in their everyday life and a lot of studying to try and catch up. I feel as if a lot of Romance/School shows miss out on these aspects and just try to skip through a relationship with happy colors, it makes it so much more realistic.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe voices were executed well, I thought they really fit the characters and their personalities, there was also quite a few sound effects that really spiced up the show as it progressed and I have to say, I loved both the Intro and Outro.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI was thinking about negating one point from Art because of some parts where the animation seemed to really struggle (like when the camera gets to a street view and all the people in the background are quite poorly animated) but to be honest, I didn't think it was bad enough to take away how amazing this show was. A lot of different shows try to catch you and reel you in mostly based off of how much cleavage the girls show, I don't mind it when there's a bit of cleavage but when every character has boobs the size of her head, it feels really redundant. But I feel the artists put the effort into other aspects of the scene instead.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI have to say, I loved EVERY character, even characters like Daichi who were there with one of the main characters to support them through it. Each character had their own purposes and their own personality, whereas, in other anime, it seems like there are about 50 girls falling for one guy. The character's personalities were all different, they all had their likes and dislikes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis show was really enjoyable, I had so much fun watching this and will most likely watch it many more times, I feel as anyone would enjoy this show even if they're not someone that watches the Romance & School genre often. Whether you're laughing or on the verge of tears, at the end of the day, it's an amazing watch.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI'm pretty sure I've summed everything up, every aspect of Tsuki ga Kirei fit together perfectly and I feel like all of the different departments worked together to create one big masterpiece. All I can ask for is another season with the same characters hopefully. I'd love it!",

Body language, voice, long sigh, all tell their feeling.\r\nThe only flaw I think can be improved are support characters. They should make them more diverse. Them all are nice people, being mindful and empathy which is not true in reality.As someone does ask, why our main couple would bother being in relationship. The reason is they feel comfortable around each other, they feel at ease and can enjoy spending their time quietly. They are stressed out from others selfishness, envy or disrespectful. But as the way support characters are in this anime, there is no stress and this feeling is just a curiosity to the opposite sex, making their love seems unworthy.\\n\\n\r\nSo in conclusion, is this anime perfect? No.\\n\r\nBut it deserves my respect as understanding how to illustrate feeling, as complex as simple it is. The studio holds up to their name, feel.",

            "content": "TLDR; A romance realistically grounded and (sometimes painfully) true to life, Tsuki Ga Kirei stands out in a medium full of the extreme and the bombastic. This quality of realism is truly its selling point, and permeates through every facet of this anime be it the story, cast, design (maybe besides Ramon's hair), or dialogue. What you get in the end is an adorable but at times heart-wrenching tale of 2 middle schoolers falling in love that is dramatic and powerful yet you could believe actually happening in real life. Studio \"feel\" have pulled of an incredible achievement, props to them for this stellar originalcreation.\\n\\n\r\nTsuki Ga Kirei features Azumi Kotarou and Mizuno Akane, 2 teenagers in their last year of middle school. The boy is a writer, the girl is a runner, and they are both shy, soft-spoken, and introverted. They fall in love, and eventually end up going through all the various trials and tribulations of middle school dating. As you can see, what we are given for premise and plot are extremely simple, yet the execution of it is A+++. There is no filler, no padding, the pace might be slow at first, but it is to the point, and every scene serves to establish something.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough TGK features a lot of idealism and innocence as befitting the teenage cast, and how things will turn out eventually is pretty much a foregone conclusion, the journey there is tough. TGK absolutely puts our leads through the grinder, but at the same time, it never gets into overly edgy or cynical territory. The ending to this tale, without spoiling anything, is MAGNIFICENT. The creators held nothing back, no twist, no sequel bait, no vague bullshit non-resolution, none of that crap. It is presented to you plain, unambiguous and definitive, which I feel is so incredibly rare these days. MAKE DAMN SURE you watch the credits.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters in TGK have actual distinct personalities and aren't reduced to a single trait. They act like realistic 14/15 year olds, who may be quirky (pinching a doll to calm down, boxing with your light switch when excited, you know the stuff), awkward and sometimes even selfish, irrational, or immature, but never completely childish or stupid. The thing I appreciated most is the fact that characters actually try to talk things out, and never lets issues go out of control for long stretches of multiple episodes, where misunderstandings and angst pile up endlessly till you just stop caring. \\n\\n\r\nThere was no character that I outright disliked, even the \"rivals\" were really reasonable for the most part, and if you tried looking at things from their perspective you'd genuinely pity them. All of the character acted as someone at their age level should, and your suspension of disbelief never gets stretched too far. I loved the fact that older characters would often try to put the brakes on the younger ones with really realistic advice. And yet, they are never unreasonable. Their concerns are always valid. It's almost like they are the audience surrogate. When you have that nagging thought in your head you can be sure a mother, father, or elder sister will bring it up.  This is almost impossible to explain without spoiling important plot events so I can't do it unfortunately. \\n\\n\r\nI'm not an expert on art, but I can tell this is the anime's weak point. Besides the aesthetics and style being either serviceable or downright jarring depending on who you asked, the use of CG is also pretty painful at times. It never got to me, but I know some couldn't stand it. Sound on the other hand is out of this world, the OSTs are marvelous like most anime these days, and there is use of proper fitting music at key moments, but where TGK really excels at is in the dialogue and voice acting. \\n\\n\r\nThis might seem ironic, but TGK's clever use of non-verbal dialogue, or even a complete lack of dialogue, is what makes the dialogue so great. Our leads and their interactions with each other are especially memorable. Because of their personalities, they are prone to grunting, shrugging, and gasping A LOT instead of just speaking up. Sometimes there are even long stretches where characters face each other and don't utter a single thing, just silence. While some found this annoying, I really find it genius, every one of these moments lets them get the point of the situation across while not breaking character. You know exactly how the characters feel, you can feel the tension of the situation, and they can be really powerful. These seiyuu are incredible, voices not only fit, but have \"chemistry\" between each other. it's just simply perfect.\\n\\n\r\nI spent every single episode of this anime crying at some point. I tried to hold it in but it just didn't work, this has never happened to me before (to this extent) in years of experiencing material across different mediums of entertainment. Maybe I just haven't experienced enough, maybe at the point of this review i'm just going through a hard point in life thus am more emotional, but I truly feel what i've seen here is special. It's so ironic that such an ordinary an honest romance is the one that got to me the most. This anime moved me so much that I had to create an MAL account to write a proper glowing review for it and bump the score up closer to what I feel it deserves. \\n\\n\r\nThat said, TGK relies a lot on nostalgia (in a good way), and I feel the watcher needs to already have been through school life to fully appreciate it. The more imperfections that phase of your life had, and the more regrets you have now, the more this anime will probably impact and resonate with you.",

This behavior is uncommon in most anime tho TBH this might be as close they can get to the reality.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime doesn't have a really strong story or a lot elements which might spice things up. Chinatsu and Takumi had crush on both the main characters.. Tho there really wasn't a strong feeling of jealousy and you might not even realize that for most of the anime. However that really is not a big issue here as it doesn't hold back the anime from being what its is now.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is somewhat of a big issue here. The anime uses CGI for  a lot of scenes like the backgrounds and crowd characters which unfortunately is not done really good. The studio got lazy with character design and recycled the same face multiple times with just the hairstyle changed. The Music is fine with nothing to praise or complain about.\\n\\n\r\nIN the end, its a simple, cute, and innocent tale of young love between two students. The anime is simple , but not bland or boring and shows the romance ,we've seen so far in other anime, in a different and fresh way. I would easily recommend this show to every fan of romance shows for its a fresh tale that is not really seen much nowadays.",

            "content": "*Tiny bit of spoilers*\r\nStory: 10\r\nReally cute, sweet, pure and innocent love story between two shy middle school students who know nothing about dating. This anime takes on another form of romance which you don't see often and most of the viewers will be able to relate to the story pretty well. Nothing too cringe or out of the ordinary. Definitely brings back nostalgic memories of your first experiences of love in school. As well as having a family that aren't too laid-back and seriously worry about their child's future.\r\nArt: 10\r\nSimple yet unique and great in quality. Sceneries are beautiful too. \r\nCharacter: 9.5\r\nThey did a goodjob in showing how the characters slowly develop their feelings of love, how they deal with jealousy and them finding out and understanding more about each other as the anime progresses. They also did a good job in showing a bit of love story for the side characters as well for a few episodes after the ending song, which is cute and funny too.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, so far I feel like they're ignoring two of the side characters that show up quite often. I don't really know how to phrase it but like what are those two going to do after being rejected by the one that they love. Not much character development for the side characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI'm the type to not watch romance animes as most of them give off the \"prince and princess fantasy vibe\" which I don't like nowadays. However, I really enjoyed this anime and have been recommending to friends who want to enjoy a romance anime that you can relate to in real life. It's coming to an end soon and I hope the last episode won't disappoint me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nDefinitely should give it a go, really worth it ^^ Finding myself not wanting this to end. \\n\\n\r\nEdit:\\n\r\nEnding: 9.5\\n\r\nThe ending was really touching. I didn't tear but it was very sweet and loved how the way it ended, I was smiling like an idiot. However, when they were fast forwarding their relationship with each other, I really wanted to see a bit of what happened to some of the side characters. Like, whatever happened to Roman and the Sensei that he likes? Therefore, a 9.5/10.",

            "content": "I am a romance fan. So, when I saw this anime with the \"romance\" tag, it automatically went into my Plan to Watch list. What surprised me that instead of a typical everyday school life romcom, what I got was a fresh blend of innocence and slowly yet steadily developed love between the two \"late bloomers\".\r\nStory: (8)\r\nThe story starts off with soft, pleasant music coupled along with a tour around Kawagoe, the place the story revolves around. As the students of school look excitedly for their classes, both the main characters - Azumi and Akane are given a slight appearance. Luckily, they end up inthe same class, and the heartwarming story begins. While they might have yet to notice, signals of love have already started to bloom between the two. \\n\r\nThis story is nothing like the average school life romcom.\\n\r\nTsuki ga Kirei fully utilizes the innocence of middle-schoolers who have yet to yearn for love, and delivers the story by showcasing bit by bit on showcasing how the main characters develop their blooming relationship. \\n\\n\r\nArt: (8)\\n\r\n\"feel.\" this time takes a different approach to how the art is handled in Tsuki ga Kirei. Unlike their previous hits like Oregairu S2 or Outbreak Company, all the characters have rather flushed out looks. While they may look bland to someone, I personally think that this further enhances the simplicity and the theme Tsuki ga Kirei has to bring out.\\n\r\nHow the specially designed characters blend in with the background is also one of Tsuki ga Kirei's features. Usually, the backgrounds are not anything flashy, since Kawagoe isn't a big city. Many buildings and such have a \"old\" touch to it. Therefore, more flashier and livelier art present in Oregairu S2 or Outbreak Company wouldn't have fit the deal. If feel decided to use that art style in Tsuki ga Kirei, it certainly would not deliver the same effect.\\n\\n\r\nSound: (9)\\n\r\nEvery single song, no matter openings, endings or insert songs are all sang by Touyama Nao. Already a big plus there. But, that's not it. Along with the really-good songs also goes with really-good background music. In Tsuki ga Kirei, every scene has its respective BGM. The whole effects feels grand, but you'd have to experience it yourself first hand to understand how well the sound is handled in this anime.\\n\r\nAlso, when they insert songs covered by Touyama Nao, it always manages to take the spotlight. Not only does it fit the scene all the time, but how you can feel the feeling overflowing from both the anime and the singer just shows how well the sound is handled. Again, you'd have to watch the anime to understand how well it's handled.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: (8) ******(There are minor spoilers here)****** \\n\r\nAzumi Kotarou is one of the main characters in Tsuki ga Kirei. He's rather fascinated with literature, and every episode he quotes a quote from (usually Dazai Osamu, but there's a time where he also quotes Natsume Souseki), which just reinforces the fact  that he loves literature so much. Until he met Akane, he wasn't really interested in love. \\n\r\nMizuno Akane is the other main character in Tsuki ga Kirei. She gets nervous really easy, and really fast - shown by her multiple interactions with her mini-plushie (I'm not sure what to call this). She's also a fast runner, but without her mini-plushie, she usually performs badly. She wasn't that interested in love either, until she *SPOILER HERE* got asked out by Azumi.\\n\r\nTo be honest, those are the only characters that you should pay attention to. But, there are also Chinatsu and Hira, who serves as people adoring for their one-sided love to become true. Others are not well developed but do not have to be, since the show is basically entirely focused on Azumi and Akane.\\n\\n\r\nThat's all for the stuff. Here's my opinion about the anime below.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (10)\\n\r\nTsuki ga Kirei is a romance that I've been looking forward to, ever since I've heard that  it was the same director that was responsible for Angel Beats. At first, I had doubts about the art when I saw the PV. It seemed to me that, everything seemed so bland, and that nothing would stand out. I checked out feel's other works, and I believe they've never used such a form of art style in any of their anime. \\n\\n\r\nWell, I'm glad that I decided to stay, 'cause what the show gave me was a pleasant surprise. This slow-paced romance that showcases the budding relationship between the innocent middle-schoolers are one of the reasons that attracted me. It gave me flashbacks on my school life as well. Unlike the many romances that usually has interference one way or the other, Tsuki ga Kirei just goes straight in, focuses and develops their relationship. Slowly, bit by bit, I get more and more attached to this anime. For as long as I've been watching romance anime, i have yet to see one that promotes such a theme. And it surely did it right. It's how they each take their own time to steadily develop their relationship that truly shook me. Step by step, their bond becomes stronger. \\n\\n\r\nI believe that this show would be one of the hiddem gems of the season. This is an anime about how pure and innocent love can be at a young age.\\n\r\nIf you were annoyed by the slow pacing of this anime, then I do suggest you to give it another try; how slow-paced it is truly showcases how their relationship develops.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: (10)\\n",

It is this that results in it being the best romance anime series I have ever seen.\r\nIn a time where genres seem to be adding more and more elements to their series in hope of bringing something new and exciting, Studio Feel does the opposite, and produces a simple, powerful and beautiful anime as a result.\r\nTsuki ga Kirei has found a perfect balance that both strips back all unnecessary convoluting plot elements and characters, and yet leaves in manyof the quiet and niche moments that make this anime so powerful. \\n\\n\r\nWhether it be the awkward silence as the boy musters up the courage to tell the girl how he feels, or the joyful, imaginary boxing of Kotarou as he recieves a message from Akane late at night, it is these little moments that are so relatable and allow us to develop an intimate relationship with these characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall success of Tsuki ga Kirei is its powerful representation of a teenage romance through quiet realism, not drama and excitement. \\n\\n\r\nMy interpretation of the meaning of series:\\n\\n\r\nLove does not need to be understood. Neither characters seem to have any idea what to do with their emotions towards each other, and each step of the way seems awkward and fragile. \\n\r\nThere are moments of sheer confusion, misunderstanding and hopelessness. However there is something underlying this, a momentum that drives them both on to overcome all of these imperfections. \\n\r\nSomething pure, incomprehensible and completely beyond their control. And only in the last scene of the last episode do they realise what it is.",

            "content": "Tsuki ga Kirei is easily the most subliminal, emotionally intense, romantic masterpiece existing in the world of anime today. However, the absolute perfection of this masterpiece is very easily missable. Outwardly, it looks bland and boring. \"Basic plot, boring characters, emotionless romance, no depth...\" I've heard it all before. TGK has been hated on for being emotionally dull, having a shallow plot, being too damn slow, and for \"doing something thats been done a million times before.\" Yes, TGK does have a pretty high ranking here on mal, but hardly anyone I talk to can understand the true depth and emotion that drives this anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\r\nTwo middle schoolers discovering love for the first time doesn't sound like the most interesting and unique plot, but heres where TGK surprised me. It's the realistic, awkward portrayal of these emotions, the way it handles the steady development from tension into trusting eachother, and how consistently realistic and emotionally driven the story and characters are that makes the story such a masterpiece. The progression of plot doesn't rely on words, but rather expression. We don't need to see inside the characters' heads, because we can already understand their thoughts by their nervous gestures, their eye contact, their movement.. everything you would expect to see in getting close to someone in a real relationship. TGK is an extremely simple love story between two young, but mature kids. Because its simple, the raw emotions key to a successful romance are extremely present. The fluttering beat of their hearts, their innocent, longing gazes, the pure desire to be close to eachother... TGK just keeps them so real and in their natural element. The way their hands awkwardly find eachothers... each of their romantic scenes are so simple, but so extremely well executed they just awaken my desire for romantic interaction every single time. Tsuki ga Kirei is beautifully crafted with pure simplicity. The minimal dialogue use and reliance on expression throughout the story is what I believe to be one of the most unique elements of TGK. People taking issue with this saying it makes it \"dull and boring\" are really just MISSING what this anime truly strives to be. The slow pacing of this anime doesn't make it boring. In fact, its what brings it to life! Scenes where the two characters are just staring at eachother are full of emotion, nervous tension, and in fact are very realistic. This anime touches on themes such as the anxiety, fear, vulnerability, and heartache love brings along with it. However, despite the quiet, awkward characters, they are both quite straightforward. This anime doesn't waste time to get to the point - romance! They start off as shy, barely talking to eachother, yet there is an instant \"spark\" between both of them that draws each of them to the other, as they struggle to overcome their own issues so that they can experience romance with eachother. \\n\r\nOne of the other interesting aspects of the story is how the mains communicate using LINE, online texting, and how their important their messages to eachother are. I would definitely recommend pausing the anime to read these, as they are quite important in the development of their relationship. This is the first anime I have seen to use online communication in such a way, and it was a rather interesting contribution to the story.\\n\r\n[a bit of spoiler] The feels started to hit me from the very beginning, only strengthening each episode until climaxed by the end. It captured in detail the raw emotions of the two mains falling in love together for the first time... looking over to someone who loves you as every bit as much as you care for them... nothing captures these emotions and experiences I long for myself as much as Tsuki ga Kirei does. It makes my heart pound because their emotions match mine. When Akane breaks down about not wanting to loose Kotarou to another girl and over her fears that his interest in her will fade with the distance, I felt that deep inside. Seeing her break down after holding it in for so long, not wanting Kotarou to think she distrusts him, was literally a direct blow to my heart. Or how Kotarou summoned bravery, being the first break the tension that hung between them, boldly confessing to the girl he likes **without having ANY idea whatsoever that she likes him back.** And us as the audience, don't know how she will even reply to this, as we only can read her emotions - not see her thoughts. The fact that shy, quiet, and nervous Kotarou took his feelings so seriously enough to step out into the unknown like that and speak so openly about his feelings to a girl he barely knows was awe-inspiring to me. Truly proved in that moment that his feelings towards Akane were greater than his fear of being rejected, which by his actions during the scene, we could all tell he was struggling with.[end bit of spoiler]\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThe art isn't masterpiece perfection, but it is still very beautiful. Smooth animation, enjoyable, simple character designs. The \"watercolor\" palate is also pretty unique. The scenery and characters are both well done and quite pretty to look at. Some of the CGI's could use a bit of work, but regardless, it was still enjoyable. \\n\r\nThe art itself emphasizes the real to life emotions and expressions. It was so clear to me, made me sad how a lot of people missed it. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nNow like the anime, the OST and OPs to Tsuki ga Kirei are pretty simple and minimal. However, they are beautiful tracks and really fit the animes whole theme. Can listen to any of them on repeat for hours on end, bringing back emotional memories. The music plays right along to the emotional ride your heart is on... wouldn't have changed a thing.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\r\nAs I mentioned while writing about the story, the characters are truly what makes TGK special. Kotarou Azumi is a soft spoken aspiring writer, who loves the author, Osamu Dazai, repeatedly taking advice from his writings and quoting him beautifully throughout the anime. It's Dazai that inspires Kotarou in both his career path and his love with Akane. Akane Mizuno is the equally quiet star of the track team. The two wind up being in the same class for their last year of middle school, where sparks of innocent love and desire begin to slowly flood their hearts. \\n\r\nAnother thing I enjoyed about this anime, was that while love triangles existed, they didn't consume the plot. Now this can be looked at both as positively and negatively. The side characters almost seem to only be present to create this said love triangle. They are hardly developed, and exist primarily for the soul purpose of the love triangle. However, considering this anime only has 12 episodes, its forgivable... yet I still mark this as TGK's only flaw. \\n\r\nChinatsu Nishio is a bright, energetic friend of Akane who loves to tease Kotarou, eventually developing a crush on him. Her feelings towards Kotarou actually has a little more depth, as she did seriously pursue him romantically, and had development with her feelings towards him. As a side character in a 12 episode anime, its actually pretty decent development, although something I'd say could have still used a bit more.\\n\r\nTakumi Hira is also a member of the track and field club, and is a friend of Akane, with a romantic interest in her. Unlike Chinatsu, he does get hardly any development as a character, especially one involved with the main characters' love triangle. His character needed the most work, but I forgave the fact simply for it being a 12 episode anime. \\n\r\nThe two main's have very different dreams and goals in life, yet their hands still find their way to eachother. It's this that makes it such an interesting love to watch unfold. What was it that made them notice eachother? The story never really tells us flat out, but I believe the two characters were attracted to each other because they both think alike. Their energy levels mesh together perfectly, and while writing isn't Akane's passion, she enjoys listening Kotarou talk about it and read his writings; likewise Kotarou sucks at running, but gets a thrill out of watching Akane do it. They weren't drawn to each other for any specific reason, rather then just liking the person. While they might be labeled \"dull and boring\" its really only a matter of perspective. However, TGK focuses on being true-to-life, not overly dramatic, and not exaggerative in its emotions (blushing, stammering, interruptions with comedy, etc). The awkwardness of their adolescence is handled very delicately and in extreme perfection.  For what it aims to be, TGK hits 10/10!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nFrom start to finish, I completely and utterly enjoyed TGK. The romance made my heart pound, my eyes water, and my imagination soar. The ending especially really tore my heart apart with feels. The extra bit after the credits is really the perfect conclusion to such an anime. Take your time watching it.. that scene in particular really hit me with feels. Tsuki ga Kirei consumed me emotionally. Not because it was tragedy like Clannad, oh no. It consumed me because it completely nails a realistic love story I would have given anything to make my reality. Actually, TGK is the only anime to make me cry more and to drop into a deeper depression then after Clannad. I would love to rewatch this anime someday, but a bit worried about all those feels coming to consume me again... it truly is a romantic masterpiece. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nI'd give Tsuki ga Kirei an 11/10 if I could. This passion-filled anime romance is truly my unsurpassed favorite. It's a rare romantic masterpiece that progresses naturally instead of resorting to the typical anime tropes. Unfortunately, this type of anime is so rare that many people can't understand the beautiful, complex simplicity that is love. I am so overwhelmed with emotion and overcome by romantic fuzzies every time I even think about this anime or hear its soundtrack. I can't stand how adorable the romance is between Akane and Kotarou, makes my heart flutter even still. TGK had way too many moments when I had to take a breather and calm down.. really made me go on an emotional high. Expect some major PAMDS and tears in the end.. I can't even write this review without getting a shaking hand and romantic desires in my heart... and its been months since I first saw it! Thats why I'm so incredibly passionate about my love towards TGK... it truly is unrivaled. \\n\r\nThe anime itself was also way more enjoyable than a lot of other (good) romances I've seen, because it wasn't focused on getting the main couple together in the end, but rather spent each episode making progress towards a greater and deeper love. \\n\r\nI'd recommend Tsuki ga Kirei to slice of life/romance fanatics who have enough brain to understand the true beauty of a simple and subtle romance story. The key thing to remember is that TGK doesn't tell a story, but rather shows us one. Be prepared for an emotional and heartfelt ride with lots of feels, tears, and warm fuzzies.",

            "content": "Studio Feel has given us an anime about two average, shy, middle school kids. Akane and Kotarou. A show which initially might strike one as mundane and boring, yet it does the studio\u2019s name justice. It makes me feel.\r\nAt the point of writing we are only 4 episodes in, but it has already struck a cord and has made me love it. Why, and how did it accomplish this so fast? Let me tell you by talking about two things which show why I love it:\r\n1.Relatability\r\n2.Love\r\n1). Relatability.\r\nTsuki ga Kirei is a show which brings you back to your middle school self accompanied with the doseof awkwardness and embarrassment you might have experienced. This is a strong point of the show, it makes you relate to the main characters and feel like you are a part of their growing relationship. \\n\r\nThe ability to make you relate to the show is important as it gets you invested into the show and characters themselves which the show does brilliantly.\\n\\n\r\nSomething which a lot of people have experienced is the feeling of joy after receiving a text or whatsapp by someone you're interested in. This joy is perfectly encapsulated into the show in just a few seconds but makes you immediatly relate to what is happening. \\n\\n\r\nBut something which the show does as good as making it relatable is by portraying love.\\n\\n\r\n2). Love\\n\\n\r\nwhat do we define love as? Having romantic and sexual feelings towards a person? Perhaps. But what is most important is how does love start? It is by taking interest in someone and undertaking actions to get to know that person better. It is this point that is expressed within the show. \\n\\n\r\nSomething which the show does well in regard to this is that it emphasizes the importance of undertaking action as love does not just come falling out of the tree right into your lap. As such the growing relationship is built up strongly as both parties undertake action to get to know each other despite being shy and nervous in general. \\n\\n\r\nThis is an important part as it illustrates love as being equal. It is not about one party chasing another. The show fully embraces the notion of undertaking action for love and it coming from both sides which makes it feel so real and genuine.\\n\\n\r\nOne last point is that the show avoids the typical clich\u00e9 drama plots you often see in romance anime which not only makes the show, relatable and lovable but also refreshing. \\n\\n\r\nThe art enhances the feeling of real and genuinity apart from the occassionaly jarring CGI background characters. \\n\\n\r\nNonetheless Tsuki ga Kirei is a show which is worth watching for anyone, even if it is not to someone's liking it is worth checking it out. You might just end up relating to something what is happening on screen.\\n\\n\r\n*This review has been adjusted from my blog post, if you want to get an even more personal view on the show i suggest checking it out.\\n\\n\r\nhttps://antagoniz3r.com/2017/05/04/spring-2017-tsuki-ga-kirei-why-i-love-it/\\n",

It is very refreshing in its own considering the genre and story is very ordinary.\r\nI love the Art, not the best but it is great. It add some feels and aura to the show.\r\nSound is Great, of course OP and ED will be because it's Nao Toyama we are talking about here.\r\nfor Character, it is your usual class type character set. Famous guy, boring guy, group offriends, sporty guy, etc. But you could really fit into it because I experience this myself, yes being a student that is.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoy this show, slow paced, so cliche yet so good.

            "content": "This review contains minor spoilers.\r\nTsuki ga Kirei is the most realistic anime series I've ever seen.  On the surface level, when you're just reading out a synopsis or checking off boxes, it sounds like a very ordinary slice of life/romance series.  Boy goes to middle school, boy meets girl, boy and girl start dating.\r\nBut the devil's in the details.  Tsuki ga Kirei is not your typical school life series, and it goes about this by an extraordinary commitment to depicting reality in an understated and believable way.  The first episode had my jaw on the floor with how much it mirroredcertain emotions and experiences of my middle school years--most of all, the sheer awkwardness of that time of my life.\\n\\n\r\nMiddle school is the time when you really start figuring out how to become a grown-up; for many people, it's the first time really becoming aware of the opposite sex in a romantic way.  As a middle schooler, just making eye contact can be incredibly difficult, if you're a shy or introverted type, as both of the main characters here are.\\n\\n\r\nTsuki ga Kirei captures this feeling better than I've ever seen it done before.\\n\\n\r\nWhat you won't find here is over-the-top slapstick violence; characters defying the laws of physics or all semblance of reality.  You won't find cheap forced jokes or tawdry overstated drama.  You won't find characters wailing at the moon when they're upset--when they cry, they cry like real people cry.\\n\\n\r\nAnother aspect of the series which is strikingly realistic is its sense of location.  Set in a smaller city northwest of Tokyo (Kawagoe), you can tell that the production staff really went all-out in studying the locations and customs of the area.  Everything is depicted in gorgeous detail.  And one strength of the animation style, which I will discuss later, is that the places in the show feel so populated compared to most animated series; large crowds of extras are not something you often see in an anime, but they bring the locations to life, and present a compelling argument for using 3D animation in the context of a series like this one.\\n\\n\r\nThe realism of the show is both a strength and a weakness.  Except for some hilarious post-credits short episodes, Tsuki ga Kirei takes itself seriously--maybe a little too seriously.  And because it's so engaged with the mundane, confused mess that is real life, it doesn't offer characters with huge earth-shattering traumas to recover from or razor-sharp, pointed thematic lessons.\\n\\n\r\nThat isn't to say the characters aren't well-realized.  They are.  Both Azumi and Mizuno feel like real kids, with distinctive goals, desires, and hobbies.  And unlike in many anime shows, their families are allowed to be very important facets of their lives, but without seeming like abusive jerks or hopeless losers.\\n\\n\r\nThe storyline is the one part of the series which allows itself to be a little bit romanticized--in both senses of the word.  It centers on relationship drama between the two protagonists.  But here too some conventions are broken; while many series spend almost their entire run building up to a big confession scene, here it happens quietly and realistically early on.  The show is about their relationship as a couple of kids learning what it means to be in a relationship--it's not about trying to find a relationship in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nAnd yes, there is some love triangle drama.  But the way it plays out feels authentic, and not forced.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some scenes which inspire emotion, but they never feel manipulative or exploitative.  They're emotional because the situations themselves are tough things which many people have to deal with.\\n\\n\r\nThe epilogue, told via still images during the credits, feels a little bit tacked on--more the realm of fanfiction than a part of the main story--but you know, I never mind these things.  Their presence makes me happy, because don't we all leave with questions about what happened to the characters we care about?\\n\\n\r\nThe one last thing I have to talk about is a pretty big one, and that's the presentation.  There's no way around it, this series is heavily 3D-animated.  It's very obvious in some shots, and not so obvious in others.  Some of the wider shots did bug me quite a bit, mainly because the characters moved a little too stiffly and robotically.  But as I watched, I grew more accustomed to the visuals, and in the end I can understand the choice to go the route they did.  Because again, the approach they used allowed them to enhance the realism in certain key ways.  Classrooms and hallways never seem half-empty here; busy streets never come across as ghost towns.  This is something traditional animation does struggle with, and it's maybe not a big deal in a less realistic series, but in an anime where the mandate is clearly authenticity, it's easy to see why you'd want to use every tool at your disposal to make that happen.\\n\\n\r\nSo while it's not the most artistically satisfying anime I've seen, I think it accomplishes its purpose well.\\n\\n\r\nNow, this may sound like a glowing review, and I don't have many unambiguous negatives to apply to this series.  But here's the thing.  With authenticity comes, maybe, a little less interest; a little less entertainment.  A little less emotional power.  Because when you're so committed to reality, you can't amp those things up the way most anime series do.  So although I got emotional at times watching Tsuki ga Kirei, I never teared up, or laughed until my sides hurt.  It doesn't have those peaks, even though it avoids some of the lowest valleys.  So I don't know if I'm going to find myself thinking about this series weeks, months, years later; I don't know if I'll ever rewatch it.\\n\\n\r\nStill, I'm glad I did.  It's a fine little show, self-contained and with many pleasing elements, and which accomplishes its purpose well.\\n\\n\r\nEight out of ten.",

And sad to say, but this was better than Your Name, not because of the colors or the story no. It was the messages and the relation to \r\ncharacters that I, we grew with in this series's 12 episodes.\r\n~-Story-~\r\nThe story of Tsuki Ga Kirei is just beautiful, never have I seen an anime that pulls off romance so well.All of you other people might be saying -\r\n         \"Hey! YouWeeabo stop making inexperienced and immature statements and stop praising it so unrealistically!' \\n\r\nNow let me say this, Don't Lie. At some point in our lives we all want this, Your Name and every other anime did well but, have we ever truly wanted to be in an anime where, none of it can happen. Welcome to Tsuki Ga Kirei, that's right our lives itself is the exact same as this anime.Sure there might be some anime close to real life but, this.We all know the feeling, Love. Especially our First Loves.Now I might be going very deep into this but, if you watched the entire thing, You will understand. Just Beautiful..\\n\\n\r\n~-Art-~\\n\r\nThe art is just amazing, no explanation needed.(Granted there will be one) \\n\r\nThe art is just calming, as if it were a dream. It is like our dreams, bright colored, happy and just in itself our dreams and hopes. This perfectly illustrates it. It has that anime feeling but it also has the feeling as if it were just a dream, on the verge into coming into our own world of existence. That is what I call well executed (For the genre of course :Romance)\\n\\n\r\n~-Sound-~\\n\r\nAgain? No explanation needed, Feels Studios did an amazing job. Last audio that i heard that was this good was Your Name. Again, none needed.\\n\\n\r\n~-Character-~\\n\r\nJust perfect. These characters built up such a personality that we can all relate to. We all have been shy around our first crushes and this just brought it up excellently. To tell the truth I'm the exact same age as these characters.Im about to go into the 3rd year of Middle School. I'm also going to join Track and Literate Fine Arts in AJHD of California. And these characters we all know or not yet know. just well done. The main character is actually very decent copared to other school romances that we know of. And the fact that I did the exact same actions alone that were shown in the anime is a huge Leap! Just life-like. \\n\\n\r\n         ------~Overall~------\\n\\n\r\nWell Done, 10/10 material, just beautiful. Now excuse me while Imma try doing all of these things IRL in my middle school \\n\r\n(Heh I'm such a web I know, but that's how I like it. And so will you too)\\n\\n\\n",

And that's good. \r\nI've braced myself to have an emotional trip. Surely, it was a pleasant one. \r\nWell, there's a boy who likes a certain girl. She likes him in return. Can you guess what happens next? (on a condition it's not a hentai :) ) \r\nIt's nervous to both of them. The show makes a good job of revealing their inner feelings and thoughts. I mean, they're so real. I could easily sympathy with both of them, remembering myown feelings... Their feelings are so poor, they make me envious. We'll have to watch the beginning of their relationships and further development. Besides them, there are another characters but they play little significance, but still they play their roles. Family, friends. \\n\r\nAlso, be sure to not skips the anime after ending. It has some hilarious mini-scenes after that. \\n\\n\r\nArt's style has got warm vibes coming from it. I've became so much fond of it. It makes a perfect match to the story. As well as the sound. Just nothing here to be complaining about. I like it. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters are greatly executed. They are... how do I put it, very Japanese. It remained me of Flying Witch. They are shy, they are polite, they keep distance from each other and respect personal space. \\n\r\nEven though, most of them are middle-schoolers. Every character here has its own \"depth\". This anime manages to show their way of living and thinking. It's interesting to observe them. \\n\r\nAlso, it's one of the several anime which uses texting as a part of everyday life. In a good way, moreover. Haven't you remembered yourself while watching how they fill up with a joy from a single message? :) \\n\\n\r\nI did enjoy it. It's sincere and heart-warming. \\n\r\nI'd recommend it to anyone who seeks for a relaxing romance story.",

It focuses on these 2 adolescents about how they meet(of course), how they spend their time together, how they grew up with each other. \r\nThe art is breathtaking. Enjoying the art throughout the episode is just satisfying. The art designers nailed it. For example, the cover art. It truly features their worldof how peaceful it is.

The anime does a phenomenal job in showing the struggles people in love go through as well as the obstacles they must overcome to achieve their dreams. The anime also shows some realistic problems that canarise in relationships and illustrates how these problems can affect people's lives and those around them. \\n\\n\r\nThe artwork and background also add a nice and unique charm to the anime and makes it more memorable to viewers. The music in the anime also does a very good job in emphasizing certain scenes in the anime and make it seem either more romantic, depressing, and more. This show will keep you on edge waiting to see more and more about the development of the main characters and does an amazing job wrapping up the conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nI would highly recommend this anime to anyone seeking an anime that focuses on maturity, the importance of striving for what you are passionate about, and overcoming challenges that life throws at you. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "First Love \r\nWhat does first love mean to you?  Is it the first person you were in a relationship with?  Or is it the more clich\u00e9 answer of the first person you were truly in love with?\r\nWho would you consider your first love assuming you have been in a relationship before?  \r\nWas it the first partner you had?  Was it a later partner you had?  \r\nHave you even had someone you truly loved?  \r\nIf you have not been in a relationship\u2026 would you want your first love to be true love?\r\nTsuki ga Kirei is an attempt to pull offa realistic view and story of first loves as well as unrequited love.  \\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nTsuki ga Kirei explores the concept of first loves and crushes that happen during the time that many people develop their first relationships, middle school.  Although this may sound like a young age to many people, it is usually the time that these students develop feelings for each other and are often confused on what to do with these feelings.  Tsuki ga Kirei executes this confusing and awkwardness well, showing characters that make awkward conversation/silences as well as having characters\u2019 stammer upon speaking with their crush.  This was a highlight of this show to me, with it being very relatable and realistic.  \\n\\n\r\nThe story itself follows the young romance of Kotarou and Akane.  Both are experiencing their first love together and all the new problems and emotions that come with it.  Their journey throughout this series has highs and lows much like any relationship has, adding to the realism. The only problem with the story is how they handled some of these problems.  Responses to some of these problems felt out of place when compared to a middle school student.  Although the responses were not mature, it\u2019s something that felt out of place and slightly detracted from the realism the anime was trying to present.\\n\\n\r\nThe flow of the series was excellent.  A bit on the slower side, which is ideal when trying to portray a first romance between young teenagers.  Since it is their first romance and the personality of the two, Kotarou and Akane tend be cautious about their decisions and try to take things slowly.  To further progress the story, seasons change, and time passes between each episode.  We get to see the higher and low parts of their relationship rather than seeing the middle parts\u2026 which is deemed the more interesting parts story-wise.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nThis style of art wasn\u2019t outstanding but was still enjoyable.  The art had a focus on using pastel-ish color palate rather than extremely vivid or dark colors.  The colors used essentially lacked depth and tone resulting in a more pastel-esque appearance.  These types of colors add to a more calming feel which helps tell the story.  A slow and awkward relationship should not use vivid colors but instead calming colors.  \\n\\n\r\nThe only problem with the series, which does usually get fixed in blu-ray releases, would be the CGI.  The CGI was mainly used to animate background characters but they moved unnaturally.  Animation of main and side characters were fine and no problems there but the animation of background characters leave much to be desired.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe opening theme, Imakoko by Nao Touyama, was a theme that represented one half of the relationship between Kotarou and Akane.  The best way to describe the song was a slow start rushed into happiness which turns into even more happiness.  The song has a wholesome and cheerful mood to it which helps portray the happiness and joy they both experience during their relationship.  Starting off slow, both got more enjoyment and happiness from each other.  The opening theme was a standout part of the series and was very enjoyable to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending theme, Tsuki ga Kirei by Nao Touyama, represented the latter half of their relationship.  The song is a slower paced song accompanied by an excellent instrumental track.  The song was a somber yet happy song, which shows the lows of their relationship and how they still want to be together.  Not as much of a standout song compared to the opening but it is still a great song.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST was very nice, supporting the mood of the series.  The background music used throughout the series wasn\u2019t striking or very inspiring but did its job to carry the flow and feeling of scenes.  The only noticeable background song was a melancholic song called Promise, it\u2019s the piano song that is used in most of the wholesome scenes.  The song is probably the most enjoyable of all the OST.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\nThe characters throughout the series are probably the best characters this season.  They show personal growth throughout the series which was something this show needed because of how the characters are first portrayed.  Both Kotarou and Akane have shy personalities, keeping a lot of their feelings and emotions to themselves.  These personalities do change throughout the series, which is to be expected from being in a relationship.  Dynamic characters is one of the most enjoyable things to see throughout a story.\\n\\n\r\nSide characters have unique personalities, some clich\u00e9 others a new trope.  Classmates besides two do not impact the story well although they get little shorts at the end of some episodes.  Family members and friends that are not classmates do have impacts in their life and are used as a story telling device to create problems for our main couple.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10+\\n\r\nThis series, for being so mundane, somewhat slow, and wholesome, was such a surprising series to watch.  The series does a great job at getting its viewers emotionally invested in the story, in the character, in the drama.  It presents such relatable settings, characters and stories that a majority of the viewers can/will relate to.  Watching the relationship change from two people who have never experienced no love change into two characters who deeply care for each other is something that has been done before in anime, especially with the more recent seasons.  Tsuki ga Kirei adds a different sense to the mix, by adding realism, angst and shyness giving the change in character and relationship more meaning.  \\n\\n\r\nAs I have said, this show does a great job at making itself relatable to its viewers, and I will say that I was a victim of this anime.  Although I didn\u2019t have the exact story or a similar one in that matter to this story\u2026 I have drawn parallels to the story with my own life.  Rather than trying to force the story to compare to your life, it\u2019s forcing the feelings of the characters onto the feelings that happened to you.  Although the stories may be different, it will try to pull those times you felt similar emotions in you back to light.  It\u2019s a story of first loves, getting over your first crush, getting over problems that the relationship has caused, balancing your new life with your old activities.  You may not be able to relate to these, but you can relate to the feeling of happiness, the feelings of success, the feelings of sorrow, the feelings of frustration.  This anime doesn\u2019t invoke old memories, it brings back feelings you may have forgotten or don\u2019t want to remember.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nWith everything this anime presented, it was the most enjoyable anime this season as well the most enjoyable so far, this year.  Watching the start of their relationship and the progression of the relationship was such an enjoyable part.  The series grabs your attention with the first few episodes, has you screaming at the decisions the characters made\u2026 some of these screams are cheering for things to happen, other screams are you yelling at the character to do something.  In the end, you realize that you are emotional invested into this series and it\u2019s something that you couldn\u2019t care less for, because the series is so enjoyable.  \\n",

IT IS THE BEST ROMANCE ANIME EVER, hell it's probably the best anime of whole genre that I ever watched. \r\nTsuki ga Kirei is a story between a middle school boy and girl who got attracted with each other on their first sight. Both of them are shy and that what's make them so cute. As the story goes on, they are dating in the mid episodes (which is really RARE in nowadays romance anime). \r\nAll the characters have anormal personality. There's not a single hypocrite tsundere, kuudere, etc. Some are forceful, but in a good way. And there's no forced drama at all, every single conflicts got solved immediately in one episode. \\n\\n\r\nAs the story goes on, Kotarou and Akane has a great relationship, there's a conflict along the way with tears, but they make up quite fast. \\n\\n\r\nThe songs are amazing, since it was sang by the legendary Nao Touyama. The art seems so weird to me at first, but it's unique. It has a completely different art compare to other anime. Every single episode brings me enjoyment. \\n\\n\r\nMost anime, i wish for the episode to be done quickly. But I want Tsuki ga Kirei to last like 2 hours for one episode. So when the anime got delayed even it's only for a few hours, it kills me man.\\n\\n\r\n Overall this anime is a masterpiece. I don't understand with people that gave this anime only for like 7 and below. people who dropped this anime are going to regretted they dropped this, they need to watch it again. I will never see a beautiful romance anime like this ever again. I hope the other author who want to make a romance anime can learn from this anime :)",

Instead of most animes where they bug you by giving a slow SoL episode each week, this anime gave you off a confession at episode 4 and focuses more on how many problems they both face, which in my opinion is extremely realistic, instead of just showing 'oh they are alive good'.\r\nPlot: 10/10\r\nPlot hole less, anime logicless (atleast at one view, the plot of the anime IS realistic), cliche less (totally, or probably I haven't seen much, but I find it cliche less), and a in a flow. Also, it was based on an original story so for the studio itself, this was a risk. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8.5/10\\n\r\nWell, the art at certain episodes seemed to clay-ish and was too bright, but as the episodes passed, the art seemed to considerably improve and the brightness and lighting was lowered, and at certain times, I could say that no art would fit this anime other than this.\\n\\n\r\nMusic/Sound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe music or sound, was as the anime title suggest, 'as beautiful, like moon'. I know, considering music or sound as beautiful, is weird, but listen to it yourself. It's like, it's built for the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nThe characters were built well, though I would not go in detail about this, because I want to keep it spoiler-free, but the way they have shown support from others and the practical 'love rivals', wonderful.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nSorry people, but I'm a person who finds good 'feels' and a beautiful-romantic story, I personally enjoy it. I enjoyed the anime, from the start till the end. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: By totalling it's around 9/10, but I would give it a 10/10\\n\r\nYes. This anime, from my side, deserves a 10/10. The anime was too good and one of the shining gems of Spring 2017. Comparing to what all I saw this season, this was one of the greatest.",

What stuck out to me the most about the story was that nothing ever felt too overly exaggerated as compared to other anime within the genre, which is a nice contrast to get from time to time. Also a lot of things that happen during the story took me back and reminded me of experiences I had when I was younger.\r\nThe art and animation wasn't anything spectacular(not like it neededto be considering the type of story this is) but was good enough to get the job done. I felt like the OST for the anime fit very well with the tone and setting of the story. The way the characters were portrayed, perfectly encapsulated the awkwardness in romance of those early teen years.\\n\r\nIf you are a fan of romance then I'm sure that Tsuki ga Kirei will be a show that you'll get a lot of enjoyment from!",

            "content": "Writing from Episode 4 so far.. SPOILERS AHEAD\r\nI never read into this series and just started watching it off of a limb and I'm actually enjoying it so far.. It's this sweet and innocent story so far and at some times it makes me feel uncomfortable.. But for the most part it's a pretty normal story about two awkward people coming together. The art for the series is alright but sometimes there's this white line on their faces that really throws me off about it.. Also when they're walking in looks kind of janky? Look they got a twig up their you know where! Soundis pretty normal and I can hear a few decent melodies and song here and there which sound good. Character wise they're both anti-social kind of people and you can tell by that. Each character has his own strong points and weak points and sometimes it can be really awkward. I'm enjoying the series so far and will update this as I go.\\n\\n\r\nSo at this point it's pretty much your typical middle school relationship.. Texting all the time and when you are together you guys don't talk at all and if you do it's short sentences. It's making it a little uncomfortable.. Ok further on and now it's getting bareable! There are actually some romantic scenes in these where it will even make me go \"awww! that's so cute!\" The other love interests are making it really interesting so far and it's looking to make a good story! I love that the other people are trying to confess their feelings and stuff but it's just not gunna happen! (from ep 7 right now) Going further into the series aswell, I'm starting to notice a little bit of comedy at some points and it's actually tickling my funny bone!\\n\\n\r\nWell I've finally finished and what an amazing story it was! I'm glad that they didn't end up going to the same school in the end.. It made it so much more enjoyable and realistic to watch it go down that way. Every character had a part in every situation and I really enjoyed most of them! The series as a whole was amazing and I'd highly recommend it to anyone whose looking for a good romance series with an innocent vibe to it!",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nDazai once said, \u201cThe weak fear happiness itself.\u201d\r\nThat\u2019s a pretty powerful statement, for it dares the reader to contemplate thrice. \u201cAm I weak?\u201d \u201cAm I fearful?\u201d \u201cAm I happy?\u201d To answer those introspections, I like to believe that most people strive for strength and confidence \u2013 which inevitably leads to that pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.\r\nFor Tsuki ga Kirei, the characters ask themselves those same questions. And although there may not be either gold or rainbows, it instead replaces that wealth and those colors with something as equally rewarding and beautiful.\r\nSTORY\r\nTsukiga Kirei follows a young boy named Kotarou and a young girl named Akane. He\u2019s a writer, she\u2019s a runner, and the two find themselves worried about their last year of middle school since the future remains unknown. When they find each other, however, they discover a whole new world that changes their lives for the better.\\n\\n\r\nThis world takes to heart what the heart does best: romance. Not the \u201cdance around the subject\u201d kind but instead the \u201choly moly they have an actual relationship\u201d stuff. The audience gets the crushing. The confessing. The waiting. The committing. The handholding. The dating. The kissing. While somewhat simple, it\u2019s almost impossible to complain about the progression presented between these two lovebirds since it more or less provides a full, worthwhile romantic tale from start to finish.\\n\\n\r\nIndeed, such simplicity builds the anime\u2019s foundation. Certain small moments may not mean much in the long term but have noticeable romantic implications in the short term. Kotarou punches his hanging light switch in victory. Akane makes him a hand-knitted scarf that he wears whenever he can. The two hang out together in private inside their school\u2019s library. The events are neither loud nor mundane, striking a delicate balance between both sides that equates to something not only real but also relatable.\\n\\n\r\nNot to say Tsuki ga Kirei doesn\u2019t have simple events that affect the plot in major ways. Kotarou\u2019s friends indirectly have his phone taken away, ultimately persuading Akane to respond with a \u201cyes.\u201d And she fails to invite him into the committee chat group back in episode one, giving them their first true interaction. No matter the approach, simple is effective, and simple is important.\\n\\n\r\nMost importantly, the show uses its simplicity to capture the adolescence of their love. They are two characters who don\u2019t know anything about anything; they\u2019re just kids after all. As such, they stumble and experience and learn while this love wraps them up like a warm blanket. Their awkwardness when bumping into each other and their families while at a local diner. Worrying about that next text to send and staying up half the night waiting for a reply. Trepidation (with blushes) in how best to express their feelings through actions. This love is their very first \u2013 and it definitely shows.\\n\\n\r\nWith adolescence in mind, Kotarou and Akane share specific moments that define their relationship. He helps to place a Band-Aid on her sore toe during a shrine visit. She closes her eyes and tilts her head upwards in an expectant manner after a fun-filled date. They encourage the other in their respective endeavors. If simple is the key and adolescence is the lock, what lays beyond the open door are these personable scenes that elevate their love ever higher.\\n\\n\r\nLove cannot always be hunky-dory, though. Akane and Kotarou fight with tougher feelings such as jealousy and sadness. Feelings caused not only by the concurrent love triangle (unclosed square really) but also the threat of separation from Akane\u2019s move to a faraway city and the implications behind that distance.\\n\\n\r\nGoing through a range of emotions as they do is part of what life is about. Moreover, it is a realistic approach \u2013 which just so happens to be another of the anime\u2019s definitive strengths.\\n\\n\r\nUsing simplicity once again, the anime includes a ton of narrative details that aim for realism and thus keep the show grounded in its portrayal. For instance, the plot doesn\u2019t go anywhere unfair. Characters actually confront one another about what has transpired, and events like Kotarou not passing the exam despite his immense effort create natural outcomes.\\n\\n\r\nThen there\u2019s his cultural dance that he practices all throughout the season. It acts as a metaphor for the wild yet meticulous feelings he experiences.\\n\\n\r\nMany minutiae also bolster Tsuki ga Kirei. A wonderful example occurs in episode one where Akane and her friends laugh at the silly \u201cWorkers \u2018souper\u2019 wanted\u201d advertisement. Or how, in episode eight, she spritzes herself with perfume before sitting down with Kotarou for lunch to mask any unwanted smells after her practice.\\n\\n\r\nWhen looking at everything together \u2013 the romance, the adolescence, the realism \u2013 the anime clearly champions (coincidentally enough) a simple yet profound idea: There is beauty in simplicity. Love doesn\u2019t have to be romanticized. Emotions do not need to be complex. Life isn\u2019t required to be fantastical. Rather it\u2019s the simple smiles, the simple gestures, and the simple exchanges that form the beauty in people and the relationships they create.\\n\\n\r\nNowhere better does the audience see that sentiment in action than in Tsuki ga Kirei\u2019s finale. Nothing short of fantastic, their simple set of actions contain incredible weight. Kotarou writes to Akane his feelings in earnest. She holds onto her favorite (and now matching) potato squeezie. And the two express their thoughts on what this love has meant for them. All of which leads to a happily-ever-after reel that perfectly caps off this story.\\n\\n\r\nArguably speaking, such a finale is almost too saccharine. After all, how many couples that begin in middle school actually stay together through both high school and college to the point that they have a child together over ten years later while juggling (for a time) the long-distance aspect to their relationship? The answer is \u201chardly any.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nEven so, after watching this story about two kids growing up, living life, and sharing a young, heartfelt love, they more than deserve such a wonderful ending. The story here is sincere. Thoughtful. And, well, simply beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nART & ANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nMuch of the art within Tsuki ga Kirei remains visually pleasing throughout its run.\\n\\n\r\nMost of that pleasantry comes from the intentional softness that complements the even softer content therein. White outlines surround parts of the characters\u2019 designs to give them a gentle appearance. Multiple background shots of the local town invite relaxation through familiarity. Lighting leans towards a happy mood, befitting the anime\u2019s stance.\\n\\n\r\nThese traits also tie back to the anime\u2019s more fundamental ideas. Akane, Kotarou, and the rest of the cast (save for maybe Roman\u2019s pink highlights) maintain simple designs that, while perhaps too plain, follow the tone and lighthearted nature of the show. The backgrounds are quite pretty, but, most importantly, they do not shy away from realism, going so far as to look like digital pictures plopped behind the moving characters. As for the lighting, an emphasis on sunsets evokes that welcomed romance.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking strictly of animation, it never necessarily wows. Kotarou\u2019s cultural-and-festival dance is very fluid but only because it gets reused multiple times throughout the season. Otherwise, what\u2019s shown is more or less passable \u2013 and that\u2019s fine. The show doesn\u2019t go for incredible choreography or deft technical ability. Instead, it toils over changing expressions and interpersonal actions to present the anime as caring rather than overbearing.\\n\\n\r\nCinematography, while nothing grand, can flourish when it so chooses, like when a scene in episode five cuts from Akane to Kotarou as they sigh in mirrored directions. For everything else, the only major gripe (and it is major) is the CG use. To put it bluntly, it\u2019s very weak, arguably the weakest aspect of the entire show. The civilians that populate the area seem more like animatronics than people (relative to the artistry), coming off as entirely too out-of-place and way too jarring to ignore outright.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nMuch like the story, Akane and Kotarou\u2019s development does not constitute anything complex. However, the gradual, noticeable shift in their thoughts and feelings presents a strong change in their characters nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nThese two middle schoolers have more in common than they originally realize. Akane plays with her pink potato squeezie to calm her nerves whenever a situation becomes even remotely tense. Kotarou lacks the self-esteem he needs to put himself out there. And the two are both reserved and quiet in their day-to-day activities. To put it differently, Tsuki ga Kirei primes them both for purposeful growth over the course of this tale.\\n\\n\r\nPart of their growth comes from a maturing of the adolescence they experience. Kotarou, a boy going through puberty, peers at a magazine with attractive women on the cover and picks up a book to learn a little bit more about the opposite sex in general. Akane, a girl who will be leaving her friends behind quite soon, has an emotional aside with them as they cry and console each other for the fun they have had these past few years.\\n\\n\r\nPart of their growth comes from failing within their respective hobbies. Kotarou finally catches a break when it comes to his writing ventures, but the people on the other end want him to stick with a less-than-ideal format. Akane runs like the best of them, but even she becomes distracted, performing poorly at a crucial meet that hurts her prospects.\\n\\n\r\nPart of their growth comes from the influencing by people nearby. Kotarou\u2019s father supports his choices, and, while his mother initially seems to dissuade her son, she simply wants what is best for him like any other mother would. Akane\u2019s big sister is someone that she can confide in, and her parents likewise love their daughter from afar.\\n\\n\r\nThis growth through maturity, failure, and influence not only persists across the entire season but also means a lot since it ties back to that sense of realism. Akane and Kotarou are two teens in a tough transitional period in their lives, so they do not need anything crazy to improve as characters. They only need these fundamental catalysts \u2013 and each other.\\n\\n\r\nFor, more than anything else in Tsuki ga Kirei, their mutual love gives them the motivation they need to succeed. A prominent example comes from their interactions alone. Compared to how they normally say very little out in public, they are so much more open when they are together in private. Longer conversations, mutual understanding. It doesn\u2019t seem like much, but their willingness to simply express themselves to a larger degree indicates the positive nature of their love.\\n\\n\r\nAs they slowly inch out of their shells with those common yet all-important romantic milestones, they begin to take chances when they otherwise wouldn\u2019t. Kotarou declares Akane as his girlfriend at the amusement park to Hira to prevent him from misunderstanding their relationship. He also works extremely hard to get into the same high school as her so that they won\u2019t be apart. Similarly, Akane goes from being unsure as to what she likes about Kotarou to finding comfort in the care and safety his presence provides. She also goes out of her way to give meaningful gifts like a matching squeezie for his missed birthday to demonstrate her commitment to their relationship.\\n\\n\r\nAltogether, Kotarou and Akane\u2019s actions prove a rewarding sentiment: kind love changes people for the better. Despite the odds against them. Despite the obstacles around them. They overcome their self-esteem problems and anxiety issues because they were there for one another. Alongside their personal growth, their journey here has positively impacted them forevermore.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC & SOUND\\n\\n\r\nOne of the best parts of Tsuki ga Kirei is its ending track. Taking the same title as the anime itself, \u201cTsuki ga Kirei\u201d is every bit as wonderful as the events that precede it. Simplicity and softness carry the piece along, providing the listener with gentle vocals, delicate piano keys, and strummed acoustic guitar strings. A moderate tempo and an emotional atmosphere invite even further appeal. If nothing else, when an ED manages to stick in the brain many months later (humming and whistling included), that must be a sign that it did at least something right.\\n\\n\r\nThe original soundtrack does not reach the same heights as the ED, but it follows a similar trend. Lots of piano and acoustic guitar playing set the mood with happiness and romance in mind. Other instruments, like violins and a harp, introduce an elegance to some of the music that makes it almost magical in its delivery, fitting the \u201cmagic\u201d between Akane and Kotarou. Moreover, a couple of insert songs also appear now and again to add some flair to the proceedings when and where appropriate.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting does not have nearly as much flair, providing no noteworthy performances due mostly to the fact that a large quantity of said acting consists of little more than nervous responses. \u201cHmm\u2026,\u201d \u201cAhh\u2026,\u201d and the like. However, Shouya Chiba as Kotarou and Konomi Kohara as Akane still deserve some props if only because these roles are among their first main ones, translating their inexperience in the field to inexperience in love quite well.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the opening track, titled \u201cImakoko,\u201d it goes for a slightly different approach, aiming for charged feelings instead. A faster pace. An electric guitar. A space-like background effect. Those familiar keys and strings remain, but these newer additions get at grander optimism that the audience is somewhat used to with this anime. Unfortunately, the second half of the piece is a bit cluttered in its sound, leaving it as the weakest part of the music overall.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nRomance is the best genre around (to me anyway), and we can add this anime to the list of examples that proves why.\\n\\n\r\nAkane and Kotarou barely raise their voices above a whisper, but the heartwarming emotions they convey both on their own and for each other get me so giddy and so smiley. A lot of my jubilation comes from their \u201cequal\u201d situations. They are the same in terms of personality, feelings, and drive, so a definitive wavelength arises from the lovely bond that they share. And it persists throughout the entire season; the romance angle never goes away.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that ending. Man oh man that ending. Everything within the finale sequence made me so emotional that I actually started crying. First from sadness, then from bittersweetness, and finally from utmost happiness. It\u2019s no doubt one of the best endings in anime that I have seen in a long while.\\n\\n\r\nI also really liked the extra side stories at the end of each episode. Their jokey nature, the looks of disgust, the different pairings. They technically were unnecessary for the show, but I always got excited when I saw that the current episode still had a bit of running time left once the ending track concluded.\\n\\n\r\nEven the anime\u2019s title\u2019s English translation suits my fancy: As the Moon, So Beautiful. Its poetic structure and metaphorical basis fit so well that no other phrase could take its place. The fact that it also describes the show in a meta sense makes it all that much more beloved.\\n\\n\r\nTsuki ga Kirei may seem unassuming at a glance, but its core offers a meaningful experience whose sincerity never falters. Thoughtful artistry and graceful music support the story\u2019s themes and the characters\u2019 progression while emotions erupt. As Dazai once said, \u201cThis I want to believe implicitly: Man was born for love and revolution.\u201d The anime did not revolutionize this medium by any means, but it certainly demonstrated that love cannot be denied.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Great, a touching romance tale that exemplifies the beauty in simplicity while channeling both adolescence and realism\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: Good, a soft style, pretty background art, smaller animated moments, and some noticeable techniques alleviate the shortcomings that the CG usage generates\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Great, maturity, failure, and influence allow Akane and Kotarou to grow as people, and the kind love they share likewise changes them for the better\\n\\n\r\nMusic & Sound: Good, a stellar ED, a romantic OST, and rookie VA work pull ahead of the charged OP\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Great, love is life, a fantastic ending, hilarious extras, and a two-thumbs-up title\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 9/10",

            "content": "Tsuki ga Kirei: A romance turned into a work of art\r\nWhen I saw the synopsis of Tsuki ga Kirei I did not expect anything interesting; However, this series has taken me on a sublime journey through a great love story.\r\nThis anime from the beginning showed that it would not be one more of the bunch. The first thing was the setting, here we do not see a typical Japanese high school as a stage; instead, we have an institute of secondary education. And although it is the last year, even this starting point is not one of the most common today in this kind ofstories.\\n\\n\r\nLet's not forget that Tsuki ga Kirei is a pure romance; obviously has touches of Slice of Life, but not enough to be considered a genre in this work. Here the center and focus of everything is the romance between Kotarou and Akane; and it is here where this anime begins to draw its brushstrokes. By the way, spoilers are coming from here.\\n\\n\r\nIt has always been said that the unsafe behavior of the protagonists of the shounen series is due to a culture theme, because in real life the Japanese are insecure on the subject of love. And that is very true. However, here Yuuko Kakohara has given us a work where this insecurity is presented, but faced in a very different way.\\n\\n\r\nInstead of having a protagonist screaming because of a touch, panicking by an approach; or worse, having an infarct due to an indirect kiss, we have a boy who little by little begins to discover his feelings, but naturally.\\n\\n\r\nAnd for this he is not afraid to follow what his emotions dictate, even if he is wrong; is that at the end of the day, it is preferable to err on the side of trying to fail for doing nothing. Perhaps everything he has read has made him more mature than usual; not for nothing, the boy always found the appropriate quote for the moment he lived.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's how in just episode 3 we already have that elusive confession that often takes eons to happen (if it happens); I have to admit that at this point I almost jumped out of my seat of surprise. I could not believe that a middle school kid had more courage than the high school kids that are seen not only in Shounen series of pure romance, but in Shounen series of other genres (including romance).\\n\\n\r\nThe best thing was that until then everything was showing with such a strong realism that it was difficult not to identify; and deep down, considering the circumstances, confessing in that moment was the most natural. After all, the phrase \"Tsuki ga Kirei desu ne\" (The moon is beautiful, right?) Was translated as \"I love you\" by the novelist Natsume Souseki, because he considered that two people who loved each other did not need direct words to convey their feelings. And do not forget that during that sequence both were in the light of the moon and came to contemplate.\\n\\n\r\nMany will say that with such an early confession the story loses interest; nevertheless, this anime more than demonstrates its error. It is precisely from the confession where you live the development of these children in all their splendor. Why? Because now they have to learn to deal with the problems of a couple, which are never easy.\\n\\n\r\nI have always thought that those stories that end with the confession and the kiss, and perhaps a wedding and children in the epilogue, end up leaving the story halfway. The real adventure starts right after that. In fact, just in the next episode of Tsuki ga Kirei (after the confession) we see that the problems appear in the form of misunderstanding, jealousy and insecurity.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, there are the fears that classmates and friends will find out, what will happen if families discover it; Not to mention that love rivals arise to complicate things even more. But again, the series wastes expertise in the handling of situations.\\n\\n\r\nInstead of going down the clich\u00e9 path of putting these problems to a halt, the protagonists do not say things, do not want to listen to the other or prefer to listen to others; Tsuki ga Kirei again appeals to realism and in that learning, little by little the boys realize that the best thing is to talk things in front and without intermediaries.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, in the midst of insecurity, both draw strength to fight for what they want. I think I'll never forget that moment when Kotarou confronts Takumi to make it clear that Akane is his girlfriend and that he no longer can go for her. How do you miss that courage in the protagonists of other series!\\n\\n\r\nBy the way, the confession of the protagonists was not the only one in the series; the love rivals also played their cards to achieve their goals. Nevertheless, Kotarou and Akane demonstrated an enormous maturity when facing and solving those moments. It is not easy for anyone to confront a confession when you have a partner, so both he and she had to show what they were made to be able to respond adequately to the challenge.\\n\\n\r\nAnd when it was thought that everything would flow well, the strongest conflict of all came. It was certainly predictable and considering the realistic approach of the series was to expect things to happen as they did. Of course, it was great to see the efforts of both to protect their relationship.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the ending. It was one of the most beautiful I've seen in the anime and by that I mean the concept. That idea of \u200b\u200bputting fear into our bodies and keeping us in suspense throughout the final episode was cruel, but interesting. Above all, because it made the conclusion more enjoyable. Not to mention the detail of using the story written and published online by the boy; and the comments section for the crucial messages to arrive was brilliantly poetic.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the technical section, the soundtrack has interesting themes (especially the opening); and the animation without being first level is competent enough for the type of series. Additionally, the character design is great. This last section I must highlight because it is one of the strong points of the series along with a formidable management.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, the management of lighting and backgrounds was exquisite. In a series where it was obvious that the animation budget was not high; It was brilliant that they showed us the feelings through backgrounds, colors, lighting, sounds, silences and music. There are scenes where this combination was really powerful, which shows that what the staff was doing was not a simple series, it was a work of art.\\n\\n\r\nAnd there is another point that I thought was great. This series was made with love and that was noticed in all the scenes. Today, in a world where even the anime has fallen into the evils of mass production; seeing a series made with that care and that affection was gratifying. Especially when it is made by a studio that does not have much experience creating series by itself. I mean feel studios. Usually they collaborate with other studios. And there can not be art without feelings!\\n\\n\r\nBy the way, I can not stop talking about the shorts. At the end of almost all the episodes we could see shorts of the characters with a more relaxed tone. These animated 4-koma were so good that they deserved to have a spinoff. It was interesting to move from the tension of the series to the relaxation of the shorts without one thing harming the other.\\n\\n\r\nSome complaints for the balance\\n\\n\\n\r\nBut since nothing is perfect, I will say that my only complaint with the ending was that after having almost all the final chapter in suspense, the retribution was very short. Show us what happened next along with the credits fell into one of the clich\u00e9s that I like the least of the anime. Those hurried epilogues where they want to tell us years in seconds. It would have been better to leave episode 12 as a preparation and create an episode 13 for the ending and the epilogue. Or at least they could make that final photo a scene in conditions.\\n\\n\r\nFor the record, at least the way in which they placed the epilogue was also original. Whereas cellphones (and LINE) were fundamental during the development of the plot; it was totally logical that the epilogue was counting through the screens of both phones (along with images to illustrate). Each line felt like an Easter Egg. See how the name of the contact was evolving from my love, to my treasure, to Benippo, to boyfriend/girlfriend and finally to a husband/wife was magical.\\n\\n\r\nAnd well, to continue balancing this review a bit I will say that some characters generated by CG to place them in the background in some scenes could be much better; nevertheless, I understand it considering that it is not a very big studio and that surely they had the limited budget. If well known studios have made disasters for lack of money, I will not crucify feel studios for this minutia.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, a series that is one of the best of last years; and that in my opinion, it shows one of the best love stories shown in the anime. I already want to watch it again because only once is not enough.\\n\\n\r\nTotally recommended. 9/10.",

            "content": "[ OUTDATED ]\r\nOver the past few years, Romance has felt like a lost and weakening genre in anime and in film in general. Tsuki ga Kirei, however, provides a fresh glimpse of what the genre is truly capable of, and that is connecting with the viewer on an emotional level with feelings that have been sought, but never found. It demonstrates its subject matter with pure realism, strengthened with beautiful setting and true-to-life characters, making for a compelling ride along an anxious path filled with innocence, fear, hope, and most notably, love.\r\n- Story: 7.5 -\r\nThe story of Tsuki ga Kirei is often pointed out asgeneric, which is partially true. Its concept is nothing knew, and it's a more conventional way of looking at the Romance genre: two shy middle-schoolers who can't help themselves but catch a glimpse of each other's eyes. They coincidentally run into each other, and the longer they converse, the more the urge for that overwhelming question (props if you got the reference) arises.\\n\\n\r\nTsuki ga Kirei, however, adds to this concept with unmistakable realism. The growing bond between them steadily grows at a consistent pace, and the troubles that face them constantly threaten the loose thread that hold them together. This rise in tension produces a convincing narrative that almost completely compels the viewer into immersion. What starts off as serene and innocent attachment grows into constant turmoil with themselves and those around them. But eventually, all things come to and end, and this story certainly went off with a bang - a beautiful and satisfying conclusion that stays true to its predefined realism.\\n\\n\r\nThe main issue that I personally have with the story is its slight predictability. As I stated before, this concept is nothing knew, but Tsuki ga Kirei has executed it extremely well. However some instances, especially in the first and second quarters, felt more contrived than natural. This somewhat lessened the experience for me in the first half of the series in addition to its slow pace in the first quarter, but fortunately, I was dealt with a very strong second half with increased suspense, provoking my interest even further. I also managed to somehow guess how the story would conclude all the way from around Episode 4. Still, however, I\u2019d be lying if I said that I wasn't captivated the ending's abundant beauty and sincerity.\\n\\n\r\n- Art/Animation: 7 -\\n\\n\r\nStrengthening the realism of the narrative is the realism of the setting. The background art is truly stunning at times, adding to numerous scenes with definitive depth, detail, and beauty. Although it isn't the best that I have seen, it certainly puts a smile on my face whenever it shines.\\n\\n\r\nWhat lacks, however, is the general animation quality. For scenes involving only a few characters such as the main cast, there is an incredible amount in detail involving slight changes in movement and emotion, perfectly showcasing the \"show-don't-tell\" notion. Many scenes, especially in the first half, are silent, letting the characters' body language speak for themselves, effectively translating those emotions to the viewer as timidity, awkwardness, or comfort.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the more characters there are, the worse the animation gets. A lot of times, background characters seem slow, robotic, and unnatural, resulting with sloppy wide shots that take away from the general realism. I had hoped to see the animation quality match the art quality, but unfortunately the comparison was one-sided.\\n\\n\r\n- Sound: 8 -\\n\\n\r\nTsuki ga Kirei showcases a great soundtrack, and although there are only one or two memorable tracks, many songs are fairly well-implemented into most scenes. A prime highlight, however, is when there is no music at all. Not to say that the music is bad - not at all, but its addition would have taken away from the respective scene.\\n\\n\r\nAs I stated earlier, there are many scenes in the first half that remain silent. The lack of music assists to build upon its current atmosphere, allowing for the emotions felt by the characters to be felt by the viewer as well. In addition, the excellent voice acting by the whole cast and a well-written script allow for convincing dialogue. Voices often crack when met with a surprise or a sudden emotion, adding even more detail to each and every scene. There were only very few instances where the voice acting felt overdone or unnatural, but for the majority, it added on to the show's sincerity.\\n\\n\r\n- Character: 9 -\\n\\n\r\nThe story revolves around our two main characters: Akane Mizuno and Kotorou Azumi, as these two characters are what give strength to the overall narrative. Both of these characters have their share of similarities and differences, but what makes them special is their undeniable realism.\\n\\n\r\nAkane, a middle-school aged girl, demonstrates the depth in her personality through her interactions with Kotorou and her various track meets. During the first few episodes, we catch various glimpses of her overwhelming inner anxiety as she plays with her little potato plushie, doing so to relieve her stress. Her personal struggles with her family constantly moving around Japan, not having a definite place to stay constantly troubles her. Eventually, this leads to her inevitable bond with Kotorou. Whenever they are together, Akane is noticeably more comfortable, still however, flinching during sudden interactions and unsettling silences. Other than the interactions between them, their inner desires are steadily revealed throughout the story. As teenagers, their somewhat irrational behaviour, especially Kotorou, reveals their desires that propel their actions in a convincing way.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Kotorou, he resembles his similarities to Akane through his timidness and genuine awkwardness around each other's presence. Throughout the first quarter of the series, he generally allows Akane to take control of their interactions, revealing his weak conversational skills - even more so than Akane. As a prospective writer, Kotorou is often praised and encouraged by Akane, but whenever she does so, he never fails to blush and make the interaction even more awkward than it was. When Kotorou does the same to Akane, she is noticeably more confident than him, also revealing a possible desire to be like her.\\n\\n\r\nThese two characters' interactions is part of what makes this series feel so genuine and endearing. A sudden statement between the two causes them so flinch as respond in a realistic manner considering their age as \"kids-but-not-quite-adults\" phase (I made that up). It constantly reminded me of the awkwardness of being in junior high and the constant changes in my tastes, behaviour, appearance, and everything else in between. The burning curiosity of what it's like to be an adult and the ultimate reality of what stems from it is all effectively translated to the viewer, along with the joys and innocence of childhood, the confusion and instability associated with growing up, and the yearned for although awkward sensation of discovering a personal attachment with another.\\n\\n\r\nThere are two other characters that affect the story and its main cast as well: Chinatsu Nishio and Takumi Hira. These two provide some well-executed tension within the story for reasons that I will not mention for spoilers, but you can probably guess what it is. Well I would have preferred a little more screen time for these characters, especially Hira, I was pleased to see how the troubles that stem from these two characters truly rock the main characters' bond and relationship throughout the story, proving to test each other's faith and trust between them through well-developed tension.\\n\\n\r\n- Enjoyment: 8 -\\n\\n\r\nThe first quarter of the series was relatively slow compared to the rest of the story. This left me ambiguous with my opinions on the show at first, but as soon as things picked up, I couldn't put it down.\\n\\n\r\nFor the first half of the show, I found it entertaining, but not to a great extent. It was enjoyable to see the birth of their relationship, but I was anxious to see more unfold. Thus I was met with the second half, and I was not disappointed. The tension associated with the second half was almost masterful, the strengthened bond between the main cast was powerful, and the pure realism associated with its inevitable conclusion fortified my love for the show.\\n\\n\r\n- Overall: 7.9/10 -\\n\\n\r\nWith a narrative having its primary focus on realism, along with its convincing and in-depth characters, backed by stunning background and detailed animation, Tsuki ga Kirei proves that the Romance genre isn't gone, still having the potential to create something great. It proves that an extremely complex plot driven by morally ambiguous characters isn't needed to provide compelling and emotional experience.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'm very glad that I managed to find an anime like Tsuki ga Kirei. While it may not be perfect, it connects to the viewer with ease, and leaving them captivated with a familiar sensation assists in reaching its status as an excellent series under the Romance genre.\\n\\n\r\nIt happened to become one of my personal favourite anime, and if you give it a shot, I reckon it may be the same with you.",

When I first started watching this, all I could think about was how awkward the two characters, Kotarou and Akane, were but how cute they also were together. I, for one, am a huge sucker for adorable anime couples so I can safely say that Tsuki ga Kirei definitely was up my lane in terms of what I would normally watch. I, personally, enjoyed watching it and was pleased with the closure of the anime and the overall storyline. \r\nTsuki ga Kirei was definitely more realistic than some other anime of the same genre or with thesame idea. I binged all 12 episodes in one day during a blizzard and it very much kept me occupied and invested in the two's relationship. Tsuki ga Kirei really demonstrates all the rocky parts that couples go through in relationships, whether they're as young as Kotarou and Akane or older. While not everyone may love this anime, I can say that I, at least, very strongly liked it and left me wanting a bit more.",

They like each other but neither have been in a relationship which causes a lot of awkwardness. This anime decides to forgo all internal monologue for the characters and instead relies on expressions for telling the audience how the characters are feeling. It works beautifully and because of it, I was able to relate much more to the characters.\r\nThis is more of a wholesome anime rather than an action-packed one.That being said, it shows how beautiful a simple premise, good story-telling, and great art and sound can be. I highly recommend it if you're a fan of the SoL genre.",

No ugly/awkward pose, great animation especially the dance scene. 9/10\r\nSound: Love the OP, for some reason the OST fits so perfectly like 200% which gives you a 'true feel' of what you're supposed to feel in certain scenes. 9/10\r\nCharacters: No bullshit, no shitty clich\u00e9 or crap assmisunderstandings and very directive characters. Felt slightly relatable to the characters a bit. Oh, and a well-executed love-triangle too. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Never felt bored on every single episode, they did a great job keeping me entertain. Its like I've absorbed so much into the story line which makes me keep questioning what's gonna happen next. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Cool story, probably one of the best art+animation I've seen awhile, OST gives the extra feeling you need, directive characters, every episode is unique and a satisfied ending. 10/10\\n",

            "content": "When watching a romance genre anime you would expect to find a lot of feelings. But many romance anime fail to deliver this kind of experience. The reason for this could be due to the fast or slow development in the story. Tsuki ga Kirei is a show that requires its audience to be patient.\r\nThe show has a slow start. You will need to wait until episode 3 or 4 in order to start enjoying the anime. The story takes place in a middle school where Akane, a 3rd year student and Kotarou who is also a 3rd year student get to know each otherfor the first time. Due to the shyness of Akane and Kotarou, the relationship development between the two is slow. Therefore, if you are not willing to wait until the completion of the relationship, I don't advice you to start watching this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThis slow development in the story simulates reality in a really good way! The kind of events that happen in the show and the way the relationship is developed give the audience a typical slice of life feeling. In addition, using quotes that were taken from a famous Japanese author, named Osamu Dazai in many episodes makes the anime more attracting. \\n\\n\r\nThe art in this show is not bad. I didn't like it at first but then I got used to it. Don't get me wrong, the art is not horrible, it's just not good enough,\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtracks and the music in this anime were really good! They fitted the anime environment and they were suitable for the show.\\n\\n\r\nTo summarize, the show gives its audience a nice experience and a taste of a slice of life genre. So, if you are a fan of romance and you are patient, then this anime is for you. \\n\\n\r\nOverall rate: 8/10",

            "content": "Going straight to the point, now that everything is fresh in my head:\r\nI'm going to start by saying that I was watching two animes at the same time: Kuzu no honkai and Tsuki ga kirei.\r\nTsuki ga kirei is a warm comforting blanket that wraps you in a cold rainy night. It's a romance with not much drama, slow pace and adorable moments. I didn't feel like the pace was annoying because the whole story is structured in a way that you just acknowledge from the beginning this isn't some raging passion between two steamy teenagers but a pure, innocent, and very much real love slowlygrowing between two very nice kids.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nit makes sense, it has coherence, it has realism, and is refreshing to see this slice of life put into animation. I didn't feel bored even with the slow pace. And I even felt some gut-wrenching moments in one or two episodes.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5\\n\r\nThis was the only thing I need to point out that... it was VERY bad. I understand the simplicity but the digital animations were horrible and the characters were too flat! The light/shadow ratio was absolutely terrible. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 6 \\n\r\nMeh. Nothing I'll remember.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7 \\n\r\nI like the characters because of their simplicity. There were times where you'll probably wish to see a bit more into other character's lives but I'd say I'm pretty satisfied with the overall thing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nIf you are a hardcore masochist who is into NTR and can't stand to see a happy end and no painful twists that shatter your soul *cough* (kuzu no honkai) *cough*, this will not satisfy you :D But if you want to watch something beautiful (not the animation, the story, THE STORY) and pure-hearted, definitely watch this! Watch it while drinking a cup of warm chocolate and you'll feel that the universe and this world are kind, are good, and that Mondays aren't so bad after all.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Watch it. It's lovely.\\n",

            "content": "Athletic Akane Mizuno from the track and fields team had long fallen for the aspiring novelist \"curly hair\" Kotarou Azumi ever since she saw him but never found the courage to approach him. As their third year of junior high begins, Akane just happens to be put in the same class as him and her hesitant actions ends up catching Kotarou's eyes too. The two keep their distance as strangers until one evening their families both happened to be dining at the same restaurant. When Akane's sister sees her shy reaction next to Kotarou, she decides to stir things up and the families introduce oneanother. Shortly after, Akane and Kotarou ends up in the same festival duties group and so, are given a chance to slowly close their distance but they soon learn the ups and downs of having a relationship - not to mention one under wraps.\\n\\n\r\n\"Tsuki (moon)\". What better a time to ask \"tsukiatte (go out with me)\" than a moon lit night?\\n\\n\r\nThis is an original show from Feel, not based on any Manga like most Anime are. Right from the very first episode, you're greeted with the beautiful sights of cherry blossoms as the new school year begins. And if you've ever visited Kawagoe AKA \"Little Edo\" in Japan due to the buildings keeping their appearance from the 17 - 19th century Edo era, you'll recognise the signature black buildings right away along with the bell tower sign - I actually watched this because I visited the place. It's a very relaxed romance show with equally pleasant art to match. Interactions are cute as we watch Akane and Kotarou explore their first love relationship. Characters are likeable with their own little signature habit such as Akane with her little stress relief toy and Kotarou using his room's light cord as a boxing target.\\n\\n\r\nInterestingly enough, some of the staff behind the Anime adaptation for Assassination Classroom was involved in this show namely director Seiji Kishi and story editor Yuuko Kakihara. Kakihara also happened to be the writer for Orange too although I don't quite notice any similarities apart from the cheery, happiness the show is mostly filled with. A bit too cheery even with everyone getting along perfectly but with this show, it's toned down a little more.\\n\\n\r\nAs with most romance shows, coincidences play a big part in getting the couple together - and becoming hurdles. It doesn't get away from your usual cliche drama coming from misunderstandings and missed encounters. It doesn't help when the shy couple are trying to keep it all a secret so that others think they're available. While the cliche situations do drag out a bit similarly in some way, the show does also resolve them quickly rather than spread out the heartache over multiple episodes. Maybe because this is a short series or Kakihara just wanted to highlight how important it is to communicate and be decisive.\\n\\n\r\nSo if you're expecting something as harsh as 5cm then... There might be a tint of similarity but it definitely isn't as bitter as the little couple puts in a fair amount of effort mutually to maintain their relationship which was great to see. There's also the odd jokes and fun shorts featuring the supporting characters after the ending credits which lightens up the mood even more so there really isn't a lot of bitter drama.\\n\\n\r\nAs with most Anime shows that use 3D, the animation can be an eye-sore when they switch to using it but otherwise the show looks good for the most part. As I mentioned earlier, the show is pleasant to watch. There's plenty of colour but not overly saturated and backgrounds are good but again, not heavily detailed so that everything's balanced out and you aren't too distracted from the characters. The Hayashi dance particularly shows off what the Feel can do and was quite mesmerising to watch. If they got rid of the 3D I think the show would have been a lot more aesthetically pleasing. While the OP song doesn't change for this short series, the animation used does half way through the show.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a cute sweet romance show (complete with plenty of blushing) without the dragged out cliche moments from the genre. If you enjoyed Orange for its romance and friendship, you will probably like this too.",

            "content": "This may seem like a cliche romance story. Well, it actually is, especially given how it is produced in this period when romance ideas have more or less been tried and tested and are getting increasingly banal. Nevertheless, the production value behind this Anime is what makes it stand out.\r\nThe story is simple: Two Middle-School students fall in love with each other and experiences the ups-and-downs of first love. You can read more in the synopsis provided. As for the Art, it is commonly seen in other Animes as well, a close resemblance would be Girlish Numbers. I just wished they would pay more attentionto portraying characters on the side or far away though, as they tend to get slightly 'distorted' in terms of facial features. But, that does not discredit the entire series in any ways, just a personal preference. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I love most about this series is its reference to Japanese Literature, one of my favorite aspects of Japanese culture. In fact, the title itself, is a giveaway: Tsuki Ga Kirei roughly means \"The Moon is Beautiful\", and is a translation made by Natsume Soseki, the father of Modern Japanese Literature and my favourite Jap Lit. author (I can write an entire essay on Soseki but one thing I can confess to liking his works so much is because they hold a personal touch to me and he is a masterful writer who can handle any perspective and literary setting. But that's for another day.) Soseki felt that translating \"I Love you\" to the common \"Aishiteru\" does not represent truly the Japanese romantic sentiment. In fact, it would prove to be too Westernised and forward, which does not represent at all the Japanese sense of reticence, encapsulated in their ideas of honne and tatemae. As such, Tsuki Ga Kirei is a series bound for numerous reference to Jap Lit. (Spoiler: Even the MC is a fan of Osamu Dazai, another Meiji period writer, who is unfortunately morbid and died at a young age.) So, it's nice how they choose to explore love using Jap lit. \\n\\n\r\nSome may find the pacing extremely slow, especially the first four or five episodes, but to me, it just does exact the kind of vibe it wanted to show i.e the atmosphere of reticence and the virginal experience of first love. The music does well to heighten the close couple moments as well. All in all, it is a very heartwarming series and does well to showcase the Japanese sense of romanticism (This might sound quite exaggerated but the MC really resembles many Jap Lit especially Meiji period-Those \"I-novel\"-protagonists; He is terribly shy and incapable of expressing himself well. He keeps to himself most of the time.",

            "content": "The first thing I want to note is that there is often budgets when it comes to development, but there are few notable instances when it's distractingly bad. Tsuki ga Kirei sticks out for this. The stiff animation and often inconsistent model dynamics makes it distracting from the overall story, reminding you that you're watching a fictional show that an world immersing romance. \r\nAfter that, the goal is to reflect upon the modern relationships of kids (Or at least that was my impression). Perhaps gone are the days of Toradora where people didn't depend on cellphones to talk and instead did it in person -where the human connection is supposed to be. Perhaps it's mean to show how introverts are connected by technology now. In the end, I found the idea interesting, but the point wasn't very endearing, nor did it really show how their relationship was a by product of it, or otherwise something contingent from that fact. The story overall moves in a muted if not somewhat awkwardly numbed pace - lacking true highs and lows, lacking in depth exploration of the psyche of introverts, which from my experience is fairly vibrant in terms of self doubt and shyness, which again is a muted prospect.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, its not bad, but I disagree with the MAL ratings, it's certainly not an 8. It's good and it carries a premise that is somewhat original. The story is coherent and mostly believable, but its not something I'd openly recommend unless there was little else to watch. It lacks far to much that could have been it, and packs it with mundane chatter and white space.",

            "content": "One of the toughest things to achieve a studio in the anime industry is to incarnate true romance in their works. It is even harder to do so in a school anime, considering that school romance in Japan is not a common phenomenon. But studio feel. succeed this mission with \u201cTsuki ga Kirei\u201d, an anime that made it stand out from other anime series of that category and deliver us a good package of pure middle school romance.\r\nPlot: 8/10\r\nDon\u2019t expect anything crazy about this element of the anime, we are talking about a real looking story, but that must not keep you away from thisshow because it is actually pretty good. Our main characters are two third years\u2019 students in middle school, both of them seem to have an interest in each other but at first, they don\u2019t express their feelings. That\u2019s until they get each other\u2019s LINE in order to be in contact about the school\u2019s sports event which they both have chores to complete. During the event, the male MC, Kotarou, finds the lost plush potato of the female MC, Akane, and delivers it to her. That\u2019s how they start building their relationship and also start texting each other more often. The events that come after that are way more interesting but I don\u2019t want to spoil anything.\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\r\nAkane is a runner who really loves running but she\u2019s a shy person. She\u2019s really anxious when she\u2019s surrounded by many people, that\u2019s why she is using a little plush potato as a stress ball.\\n\r\nKotarou is a guy who loves reading and writing as well, he wants to become an author.\\n\r\nExpect the MCs there are two friends Kotarou, two friends of Akane and her sister, also Kotarou and Akane\u2019s parents as well, something that makes this series even more realistic as they play a huge part on the flow of the plot and they are not left on the margin.\\n\r\nTheir friends play a huge role in their relationship because they pretty much helped it to start off.\\n\r\nArtwork & Animation: 7/10\\n\r\nWell, this is what this anime does right and wrong at the same time.\\n\r\nCharacter design is awesome; all of the characters are pretty cute even though their design isn\u2019t so detailed. I think it fits well with the whole romantic atmosphere. A downside about this is that the characters are way too bright sometimes.\\n\r\nThe backgrounds are okay. Cool coloring and all in all a really nice environment for the development of this story.\\n\r\nBut as I said the studio did some mistakes as well. One of them is that they used bad CG for the background characters or for scenes when the characters of the story are mixed in a crowd.  It just doesn\u2019t fit in the whole series, it would be better if they didn\u2019t use CG at all.\\n\r\nMusic: 8/10\\n\r\nI am not a specialist on this topic so I will only speak about the opening and the ending songs.\\n\r\nThe opening song is just amazing. The singer, Nao Touyama, is a really talented person; her performance on this song was so good. Also, there is no doubt that the composer of this song is a true professional. \\n\r\nAs for the ending song, the singer is once again Nao Touyama, so I think that I don\u2019t need to say anything more. Now the melody of this song is something different and it really does its job well, to relax you after a good episode.\\n\r\nVoice Acting: 7/10\\n\r\nAkane\u2019s voice actress is Konomi Kohara a really talented seiyuu who hadn\u2019t got a lot of jobs in the industry when she got Akane\u2019s role. Today (March 2019) she has voiced Mina from Karakai Jouzo no Takagi-san, Koyomi from Yagate Kimi ni Naru, Miu from Domestic Girlfriend, Erena from Hanebado! and Fujiwara Chika from Kaguya-sama: Love is War. So yeah, her voice fits Akane\u2019s character -a cute shy girl- very well.\\n\r\nOn the other hand, Shoya Chiba\u2019s voice isn\u2019t that good for Kotarou, at least in my opinion, but generally, it\u2019s okay.\\n\r\nFor the other characters voices are just okay nothing special to mention.\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nAll in all, this series may seem like the typical school romance, but it isn\u2019t actually that clich\u00e9. It is the kind of series that makes you say: \u201cI would like so much to live a similar story in my life\u201d. I think that this is the pure romance anime that you were searching for (if you were). Give it a try, it will not disappoint you.\\n",

The MC is a butt-hurt little boy who was pissed by the fact that his girlfriend rejected a guy who tried to steal her away from him. Shows no gratitude for the fact that she did not dump him for another one. Furthermore, in other scenarios, he is not very direct with his responses, almost to the point of incompetence. There are much better anime out there like Clannad and Tsurezure Children.",

            "content": "A rare gem which stood out due to it's pure simplicity.\r\n**This review will contain minor spoilers**\r\nAt a glance, Tsuki ga Kirei is a romance anime which presents a simplistic yet fruitful romance where a pair of teenagers fall in love with each other and eventually \"live happily ever after\". Most of you might feel bewildered as to how such a \"cliche\" relationship managed to stand out among the romance genre. To which the explanation boils down to one simple element- execution. If it weren't for it's superb execution, Tsuki Ga Kirei wound't have left such an impact compared to it's siblings.\r\nThe romance\r\nTsuki ga Kirei followsa love story between two senior middle school students experiencing love for the first time of their lives. This setting, unlike the usual \"high school setting\" highlights the confusing yet heartfelt nature of their first love while simultaneously reminding us of the fact that graduation, subsequently, separation is coming close to our main protagonists; provides a source of tension. \\n\\n\r\nYet a brilliant setting is not all that contributes to a well executed romance, to which some may ask, how would you define a fictional romantic relationship as solid? To me, it exists not just  because the writers say so on paper, but from the experiences being shared and choices being made by the couple that result it. Although some may find Tsuki ga Kirei to be slowly paced, the plot never paused at any point. Instead there was always a sense of progression throughout the 12 episode journey due to the aforementioned qualities that the romance in Tsuki Ga Kirei possesses.\\n\\n\r\nThe abundance of romantic exchanges between our main leads was also a surprising welcome; kisses and hand-holding isn't uncommon throughout the mature stages of their romance despite their young age and never failed to pull my heartstrings. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe sound & art design\\n\\n\r\nTsuki ga Kirei makes good use of sound design to convey the emotions of our characters and set up an atmosphere with weight and tension. Take our male lead Kotaru as an example, he's a reserved and shy young boy. Instead of bombarding us with his internal speeches, we are met with grunts and sighs when he's faced with situations of confusion or stress, showing us his genuine feelings without excessive dialogue. And because of that, it makes the moments in which he speaks stand out more to the audience and carry more weight as he finally opens up emotionally. Not to mention the spectacular usage of silence to grab our attention during crucial moments, certainly adds more weight and tension to scenes. The sound design illustrates a point, that Tsuki ga Kirei wouldn't work as a light novel or manga, but only as an anime could it really impress it's audience.\\n\\n\r\nThe art, despite some complaints of it being bland and sub-par, was decent enough for me to feel invested to the show.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment\\n\\n\r\nOne of the things done right in Tsuki ga Kirei is the fact that side characters play a role in the story with their own little romance tales that never feel out of place nor hog the spotlight from our main protagonists.\\n\\n\r\nAnother interesting aspect of Tsuki ga Kirei comes from the usage of LINE messages among characters of the show, which is something that I, as an Asian who uses messaging apps frequently can relate to. The translated LINE messages at the end of episodes serve as windows to the lives of the cast, adding more enjoyment along the way.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe ending\\n\\n\r\nProbably a majority of the audience who ended up liking this show will tell you that the ending was what was worthy of it's praise. As I have mentioned earlier, Tsuki ga Kirei concludes itself with a cliche \"happily ever after\" ending. While most romance anime nowadays tend to purposefully restrict romantic exchanges and satisfying endings due to various reasons such as the \"light novel/ manga paywall\" or the creators just wanted to spread a message, which mostly results in screen-punching or internal otaku suicides from sheer disappointment. Regardless, I would say that the ending we got was well deserved, for the audience and for the characters. As it would be fitting to use such a simplistic ending for an already simplistic romance. The way the execution was done speaks volumes on how brilliantly unique and rare Tsuki Ga Kirei is at the current state of romance anime.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

But since i saw it has good ratings i decided to give it a try.\r\nIt started off really bad. 2 MCs who were still in the middle school, timid, emotionally unstable, and hardly even talk to each other. The development was then very slow up until more than half the series where it went a bit better, but still with boring MC characters with the addition of a bit conflicts and dramas. The ending is still sweet though the timeline jump was rather massive. \r\nOverall it's still a boring romanceanime with a flat character development. 4/10 from me.\\n",

It's title sequence of falling cherry blossoms and strong score in it's opening song are embedded in my head, weeks on from finishing the fleeting 12 episodes.\r\nThe story is fuelled by the first love built between two school students, the shy and aspiring writer Kotaro and the equally shy and running enthusiast Akane. The show isn't just about love though, it highlights the daily grind of schoolers in Japan and the dedication of fitting in hobbies or clubs whilst keeping up with friendships.\r\nThe main communiction betweenthe two near the start is by using LINE a popular messaging service in Japan. At the very beginning, the two seem to be complete strangers, but in fact they already have an unanswered interest in one another. It comes down to club work needs to keep in touch by a group chat to provide them with a way start talking one on one by LINE.\\n\\n\r\nFurther on in the series, the two do start dating officially and the awkwardness between them remains to be endearing, you can't help but route for them to build their confidence and grow as a couple.\\n\\n\r\nOne of my favourite moments were the simplest, such as the late birthday gift of an identical 'potato squishy bean anxiety releaver' (yes thats right) which she gives to him with what little money she has, and causing a blister whilst walking in traditional kimono for the festival in the process.\\n\\n\r\nLater on, confessions of 'I like you, choose me instead' come from different friends in their close circle, and whilst this fuels anxiety about the strength of their relationship, they still get over their fears of having one another stolen away and become even closer. Friendships also stay in tact, even if we do see some heart wrenching scenes for affections not reciprocated.\\n\\n\r\nI'll keep the ending itself spoiler free because it does drop like a bomb. You really need to stay with the anime to have the built up feels smack you down to only offer a hand and pull you up again. Tears will be inevitable if you let yourself connect to the characters developing their awkward romance and their determination to stay together forever.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the anime is pretty flawless, despite some bad CG in the background (and I really mean bad, watch out for souless students haunting the place), the story and characters are memorable and makes the 12 episode series worth a watch if you like a slice of life romance. Awkward couples and all, with plenty of LINE stickers. Give this show a go!\\n\\n\r\n9/10 from me, point lost by bad CG soulless background people!\\n\\n\r\nOpening tune is called Imakoko.\\n\\n\r\nYou can watch the anime on Crunchyroll subbed right now!\\n\\n\r\n@RayeRayeChan",

The ending had some beautiful art, which cannot be said about the opening, which was mostly stock footage from the episodes.\r\nAnimation was very distinct, possibly the best I've seen this whole year.\r\nThe main characters were often too bland in design and personality. I ended up liking the side charas much more. Luckily theirpersonalities do improve a great deal in the second half, but too little and too late.\\n\\n\r\nMy biggest problem with the show is the amount of out-of-place dull motionless CG crowds. Some times they are hidden well with blur effects, but other times they take much more screen space than all the properly animated characters, making them painfully obvious.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend watching this either as a feel-good anime or when you're tired of all the cliched romances, since this one offers a much more honest view.",

            "content": "*First time writing a review*\r\nSo here I was, 2am on a Sunday, day before school. I had around 5 hours left before I had to get up and get ready.\r\nI was thinking to myself that maybe I should sleep, however, I didn't want to. I was really in the mood to watch an amazing romance anime, one that would connect with me on an emotional level and then leave me happy the day after.\r\nI was looking through different anime's and then I found Tsuki ga Kirei. What seemed like the perfect anime. I'll tell you right now, I was right.\r\nStory - 10/10\r\nWhat made Tsuki gaKirei so amazing was that it wasn't the same as your everyday romance anime. There was no pointless drama and harem's. This was clear cut and right to the chase. It focussed on two people, and only those two people. \\n\\n\r\nNow of course there was some drama, however it wasn't pointless. It was used to build up the characters and progress through their relationship.\\n\\n\r\nThe story beginning to end was magnificent. There really was no gaps, and just watching Tsuki ga Kirei felt magical. You suddenly become carefree and you can leave all your worries aside for 5 hours.\\n\\n\r\nMost anime's have a great build up but then the ending leaves us hanging and wanting more closure. However, the ending for Tsuki ga Kirei was well thought out and satisfied the viewers. Unlike most anime's, it didn't leave a hole in my chest.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI first watched the trailer for Tsuki ga Kirei before watching the anime. From the trailer I thought the art style was a bit weird. It was nothing like your typical anime. This left me intrigued, I wanted to watch it even more, especially after reading the synopsis.\\n\\n\r\nI would have to say the art style was quite unique when it comes to anime and it really did it's job in the long run.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound of the anime was great. All the sound effects were clear, and there was nothing wrong with the voice acting.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending songs were pretty enjoyable as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 9/10\\n\r\nThe main characters of the anime were great. They were consistently developing throughout the anime. By the end of the last episode you can tell the journey they have been through required a lot of work and effort.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the side characters, I think some of them could have developed slightly more, especially the one's closest to the main characters. However, some people enjoy focussing only on the main characters throughout the story, which can be enjoyable as well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nNot much to say here except that it was amazing. It is one of the anime's that I have enjoyed the most. It really connects to your emotions and has you always wanting to watch more.\\n\r\nThe ending was well developed as well. So, as I said before, you won't be left with a hole in your chest.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nTaking everything into account, I think that when it comes to romance anime, Tsuki ga Kirei was a masterpiece. It is high up there with every other romance anime. It might not reach Kimi no na wa's detail and development when it comes to the Art and Sound, however it was still amazing. \\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for actual romance, not harem's and tons of drama, then Tsuki ga Kirei might be for you.",

Everything is executed in a simple way but it is able to produce astounding effect.\r\nStory - 10/10\r\nThe story connects well with no plot holes (from what I've seen). Simple storyline yet smooth execution.\r\nArt- 8/10\r\nThe character design fits well with the anime. At first, the art looks \"out of place\". However, as I proceed with the story, I am convinced that this art synergize well with the anime.\r\nSound - 10/10\r\nThe OP, ED and Insert song is great. They conveythe feeling of melodrama, romance and teenage-life vibe (perseverance, struggle, conflict, factors we faced during teenage-life, maybe still facing in the future).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 7/10\\n\r\nThe characterization is lacking for the supporting characters. Although with the help of end scene, it's still not sufficient to fully potrays a character. Instead, some leaves more question mark in my head.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the main cast have deep and well-rounded characterization. Well, it should be  since the story revolves around them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment & Overall - 10/10\\n\r\nYou might be wondering why the overall is 10/10 when I rate 8 for art and 7 for character. I'm still reemphasizing on my point where \"Simplicity\" is the best word to describe this anime. The simplicity of the art, character and  story compliments each other perfectly. As a result, I rate the anime in overall as 10 due to the complete synergy of different factors.",

            "content": "TLDR/Summary: Boring, milquetoast in every respect, and completely derivative, Tsuki ga Kirei manages to do nothing but tell the most basic story with bland characters. It fails to have any depth in any facet as well as lacking any shallow, surface-level appeal, making this show uninteresting and unable to set itself apart. The glacial pace of scenes and bad character design only exacerbates theses problems. At its best, this show is plain white bread. At its worst, its a stale loaf without having any drinking water. \r\nThe problem with this anime isn't necessarily that there are problems (which there certainly are), but more that itlacks any strengths. In wracking my brain for positives, I could only come up with two things that I would actually call good: the characters typically acted realistically and the kiss scenes were done pretty well. That's it. You could maybe also argue the music, but I ultimately found it mediocre. \\n\\n\r\nNow that I've gone over all of the positives, its time to delve into where this show really fails. Many of these failures could possibly be overlooked if the show was charming in other ways, but it failed to do anything spectacularly well to look past these shortcomings. \\n\\n\r\nFirstly, none of the side characters had any personality. They were all very bland and had no input on any of the outcomes in the story (with the possible exception of Koutaro borrowing the phone or him getting jealous). None of their actions really mattered and none of them developed or even showed character traits. The whole point of realism as a genre is the characters and if you fail here in any form of media aiming for a realist portrayal your work will be boring. To be fair, this would be fine if your main couple can pull the personality of the show by themselves, but they definitely can't. \\n\\n\r\nSecond, the plot was predictable, shallow, and uninteresting. If you are going to do a plot that has been done a trillion times before, the only way to make it worthwhile is to deviate somewhere, whether that is concept, character interactions, or even quality. Tsuki ga Kirei doesn't. To call it milquetoast would be putting it lightly. It didn't innovate with its plot points, characters, interaction, setting, or even directing/portrayal. It was a cookie cutter plot, cookie cutter characters, etc. These can be fine each on their own, but if there is no unique aspects anywhere it creates a feeling that the story is not one worth telling.  For the same reason I would not tell a story about how I went to the store and came back with a carton of milk, Tsuki ga Kirei is a bad story where very little exceptional, interesting, or unpredictable things happen. \\n\\n\r\nThird, the pacing was horrible. I watched the majority of the show in 2x speed, and it still felt like characters were talking slowly and scenes were dragging on. I actually enjoyed the show more like a 4.5 than a 3, but the fact that it felt only normal in 2x speed was certainly a knock. Additionally, the show took 3 full episodes to stop being complete garbage which is too many when you only have 12 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nFourth, the character designs (specifically the main). Most of the faces were the exact same. Ultimately, this isn't actually that big of an issue, but it was exacerbated by making the two main characters look almost exactly alike. This admittedly may not be a problem for everyone, but it is a huge issue to me when we are supposed to see these characters as unique. \\n\\n\r\nFifth, a lack of development or depth to the main characters. This also extends to the side characters, but is clearly of more importance with the main cast. They never change in any way or show any moments of human complexity. To be fair, change isn't absolutely necessary if you make a point of resistance to change or create a change in viewer perception of a character, but none of this happens. Even if a character never changes, if their complexity as characters is displayed that is often enough to be engaging, but they were utterly bland and simple characters. To be fair, you could argue the characters different displays of emotions (predominately jealousy, embarassment, or fear of rejection) were these complexities and in a way you would be right. The only problem is they were just standard reactions, with no more complexity or depth than if an author simply wrote \"He felt jealous.\" It was the equivalent to the tsundere heroine meme that is \"It's not like I care about you or anything, baka.\" Its just basic and uninteresting unless there is more going on or some context, which there isn't. \\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, I had some pet peeves that weren't drastic errors, but should be noted. The credit ending was sweet and endearing, but didn't fit the tone of the show imo, Akane's actions to me are too diabolical to be realistic unless they painted her as an evil character, the story he wrote at the end being discovered is a little too convenient, and the fact that they never brought up his interest in boxing and the Ali poster was a huge missed opportunity to actually add something to the character. \\n\\n\r\nI don't understand how anyone can give this show a 7. That might sound arrogant, but it is undeniable that it wasn't innovative, it was purely basic. If you like basic thats fine, but calling anything purely basic more than just good seems intellectually dishonest. As I said in the TLDR, at its best this show is plain white bread. I can understand how someone can like plain white bread, but rating it 8 or high baffles me. At its worst, its stale, tasteless, and drags on forever.",

            "content": "Oh Studio Feel, how my love for you has increased. It\u2019s weird too, Studio Feel has been a studio of flexibility. From stuff like Kiss x Sis, and Yosuga no Sora, to something like this. What we have here is a beautiful romance anime recommended for those who seek steady pacing, realistic situations, and amazing characters.\r\n\tTsuki ga Kirei is an anime that takes place before highschool, basically middle school. As you know, love that blooms in middle school takes time, and requires a lot of patience and dedication. Our main characters are Azumi and Akane, two middle school students who are still a bit immature.However, immaturity is not necessarily a terrible thing. It just means it\u2019ll take more effort to make this love connection work.\\n\\n\r\n\tOur 2 characters do seem to have some sort of feeling for each other, it takes some time for them to show for one another. But that\u2019s the beauty of it. When 2 people slowly come to terms with their feelings, and confessing their love for each other. \\n\\n\r\nSeeing series like this, is very refreshing. Mostly in romance anime\u2019s I watch it involves a lot of drama that doesn't get fixed till a couple more episodes finish. Funny how the drama in this anime is fixed almost immediately, taken on by a mature approach. Now, I love drama, drama is part of what makes a romance anime for me. But to see this kind of drama and coming to a resolution for it in the same episode, now that\u2019s something I don't see everyday on anime. \\n\\n\r\n\tOne of the obvious portrayals of emotion these 2 show is shyness, if you can call that an emotion, idk. When these 2 are shy around each other, thinking what they want to do in their mind, it creates a soft atmosphere with a great amount of cuteness. Seeing how they can\u2019t communicate well in real life at the beginning, but can talk perfectly on LINE reminds me of my Middle School moments. I just wished I spent my youth more wisely.\\n\\n\r\n\tBack to Azumi and Akane, they don't show feelings for each other at first, but as time goes on, it gets more apparent. To see how these feelings and love unfold, well, you\u2019re going to have to watch the anime.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe art style, in particular, is very unique to my eyes. I haven't really seen anything like that yet, and I feel like it fits the anime very well. The art really gives the characters their shine and makes them stand out. The art looks like what it would be if a middle-school based anime was made. Which is another reason why I love this anime so much.\\n\\n\r\n\tOne of the most outstanding qualities of Tsuki ga Kirei stands within Nao Touyama and the soundtrack. Every single insert song, OP, and ED shouts out Tsuki ga Kirei. It sounds like music where you can\u2019t find anywhere else except this anime. The music has that soft feeling that makes you fall in love with it more. The timing and the proper execution of the OST really makes the scenes in this anime a lot more impactful. Which makes this one of the best romance anime\u2019s this season has to give us.\\n\\n\r\n\tSo why watch Tsuki ga Kirei? \\n\r\n- The characters are what you would expect from middle-schoolers (shy, indecisive, etc.)\\n\r\nThe pacing is steady and makes it a realistic love story. \\n\r\nThe soundtrack fits and gives the scenarios more meaning, the art is smooth, soft, and colourful, giving the characters more outstanding physical qualities\\n\r\nThe voice acting is appropriate for each character\\n\r\nThe drama that occurs get solved within the episode or the next episode\\n\r\nKiss Scenes xd\\n\r\nCharacters aren't the usual and not filled with your usual tropes\\n\r\nAnimation is great\\n\r\nThe process of the characters becoming more in love with each other makes is a beautiful thing to watch\\n\r\nNao Touyama :)\\n\\n\r\nI really hope we get more content, but for now, this is my favourite anime of this season (Speaking Non-sequel wise)\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, for me, it\u2019s a 10 out of 10. My standards for anime isn't very high. A 10 for me means that I enjoyed it to the fullest and it relates to my personal life. Which it succeeded in both. I encourage those of you who are deciding to watch give it a couple of episodes. If you like a steady pace anime with characters coming to terms with their love, and a beautiful soundtrack, this is for you. A couple episodes shouldn't hurt :)",

It all started like any casual school anime (high- & middle- school), but you see how a shy and unexperienced couple develops their relationship from scratch. I honestly didnt expect any good from this. But its seriously good.\r\nThe plot had something that really hit me. Every single development would have been different if you changed one event. I already said this love is one of a kind. The anime made me feel likeif 1 thing was changed, the whole development would be different because all main characters are just really shy and unpredictable...\\n\\n\r\nThis anime was so focused on feelings, and that was actually visible in the artstyle. The art was not focused on the characters appearence but more on their expressions. Also the environment and ambiance created by it were more important.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the music. Its beautiful and perfectly fits the moments. Its a combination of the art, music and dialogues that create this heartwarming feeling. The dialogues on LINE are realistic and fit the personalities of the main characters. There is also a lot of progressions visible in the the dialogues they have.\\n\\n\r\nFor me, the most important thing about a good anime is the impact. There are a lot of beautiful lovestories, but if it isnt brought right and if it does not have any impact on you, its just a shame that someone else didnt work it out. I thought this was going to be childish, but I enjoyed it even if it seemed a bit childish sometimes. The way a story is brought to the watcher is just really important.\\n\\n\r\nI give this anime a well-earned 10/10. This is without doubt a masterpiece.\\n\r\nEven though its pretty unrealistic to some people. For example, the way love triangles worked out so well. In my opinion this is just a story that has a smaller chance to happen (not unrealistically small) and its nice to see. In the end this is just some cute story that I enjoyed.",

            "content": "Looking for an actual, complete, and satisfying romance anime? Well, do I have the thing for you! Seriously, though, this anime is so touching and real. I think it'd be a good anime to watch for anyone looking for something in this genre. \r\nThe few bad things I have to say about this anime all pretty much revolve around the art style. I'm not that big a fan of the CGI type character designs, although this anime isn't as CGI-esque as shows like God Eater. Also, all the objects and characters in this anime had a stark, white highlight around the edges of them, soI wasn't that big a fan of it to begin with. Obviously, I got used to it, but it was ever so slightly off-putting in the beginning. There were some beautiful scenic shots, though.\\n\\n\r\nThat's enough of the bad. The best thing about this anime is how true to real life it is. It represents first relationships perfectly, so I'm sure this anime will either be relatable or nostalgic for people, depending on their age range. Everything you see is so, so accurate. From worrying over little fights to freaking out over vague text messages to stressing about your own insecurities in the relationship; it's all there. I think it's a really good representation of young love and how it plays out for two people that are very dedicated to each other. \\n\\n\r\nI also appreciate that this is a romance anime that focuses on the relationship as it's happening rather than spending most of the episodes setting groundwork for the pair to get together in the final scene. Like I said, it's nice to see how an early relationship progresses. Also, although this anime is about middle school kids, it doesn't at all make them feel immature. I think it's an important choice that was made to have the characters know what they wanted out of their relationship despite not having all the answers. Watching ignorant kids say nonsensical things about love would've been quite annoying to watch, so I'm glad that trap was avoided.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for something that'll make you feel good, smile a lot, and get the warm fuzzies, definitely watch this anime. It brought back so many memories for me that I could look bad on fondly through this anime, so I'd invite all of you to do the same.",

            "content": "TL;DR: You like romances? Watch it. Development as a couple, many romantic scenes & dialogue, hugs, holding hands, kisses.\r\n_____________________\r\nHonestly, I hardly can't get over how perfect this anime was in my eyes. One of my favorite romances so far. \r\nStory -\r\nThe story is about Akane and Kotarou, both being in the same class at middle school. She is a track runner and he the president of the literature club and aspiring novelist. The show starts off at the very beginning, when they didn't even know eachother. Both are extremely shy, which made the first episodes an accumulation of awkward situations, but you see a lotof character growth throughout the show. They become a couple rather early on, and both start to leave their shells and experience what it means to be in a relationship. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I found to be pleasant compared to other romances:\\n\r\n- Quite some time passes throughout the show, allowing them to become a couple rather early and develop their relationship at a decent pacing.\\n\r\n- No drama built around love-rivalry \\n\r\n- The main characters both were very likeable, simply because they are so... normal. Not like in other romances, where one of them is a genius, the most popular person in school, a total weirdo or anything like it. It made the whole romance so much more relatable and reminded me of my own youth at some points.\\n\\n\r\nArt / Sound -\\n\r\nArt as well as sound.. truly beautiful. The detailed art and the quality of the animation was absolutely perfect, you can't wish for more.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter -\\n\r\nThe show doesn't really focus on anybody else than the two main characters. \\n\r\nThe main characters both are very average people, in terms of looks, intelligence, popularity etc. Their development as a couple and how they open up to eachother was awesome.\\n\\n\r\nThe few sidecharacters were nice & fun too. Even though (as it is for most romances) there are other people with feelings towards the main character, nobody is trying to break them up and they actually value the happiness of their friends.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment -\\n\r\nIf you measure your enjoyment in how many laughs you had, that would make the short clips after the outro the best part. Some of them were really hilarous.",

            "content": "(No spoilers! Written for my blog, thought I'd post here on MAL too!)\r\n\u201cShe was my first love. I knew nothing. I was so nervous.\u201d\r\nThe Spring 2017 anime season has delivered again, this time with Tsuki ga Kirei, otherwise known as As the Moon, So Beautiful, a true gem among the romance genre. Tsuki ga Kirei tells the story of the shy and poetic Azumi Kotarou and the popular track star Mizuno Akane, two third year middle school students, and their experience with first love.\r\nTruly, the only downfall to this anime that I consider large enough to be worth mentioning would be the opening. The musicdoesn\u2019t leave a lasting impression and even if I were to hear it now, only a day after finishing the title, I probably wouldn\u2019t be able to say which anime the song belonged to. However, the use of sound and music (or rather the lack thereof) throughout the rest of the show did wonders to bring out the emotions and atmospheres that were created by the characters themselves.\\n\\n\r\nAs for atmosphere, I think the best way to describe this anime would be awkward. But truly, isn\u2019t that what first love is all about? Going back to the music, the lack of ambiance serves to further the tension between our two protagonists even more than Azumi\u2019s stuttering or Mizuno\u2019s silence could achieve on their own.\\n\\n\r\nTsuki ga Kirei was able to portray a realistic middle school love story, a considerable feat when you take into account that most people equate realism in anime with being dull or boring. Instead of keeping the viewer interested with the typical over the top anime theatrics, this show kept its audience by keeping them as close to the main characters\u2019 emotions as possible. You feel Azumi\u2019s embarrassment when he is left out of a club activity, Mizuno\u2019s anxiety about improving herself through track, and the giddiness of both of them as they experience several of their firsts together.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime portrayed a beautiful love story in an unconventional way, and is sure to remind its audience of their own first loves. If it weren\u2019t for the opening, this would receive a full 10/10 from me, but just because it\u2019s resting at 9/10 doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t be one of my favorite titles to come from this season.",

What a waste of my time\u2026.\r\nThe story was very standard, but if executed well, it would be enjoyable. It was not though, so, unfortunately, I was bored throughout the whole story.\r\nI watched this with a friend and we made a comedy out of it; it was just that ridiculously bad for a romance story. \r\nIt was supposed to have some really bad struggles and shit, but this was just weak and pathetic and not really that much of astruggle. It was a pain to watch how the characters made problems out of things they shouldn\u2019t have made a problem out.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was like 2.5D or something. I did not really like it, but I don\u2019t judge too much on art. It did look stupid at some moments, but yeah. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were the worst of this show. The main characters who fall in love with each other are plain; I did not care for them one bit. If one had died it would have taken me a while to notice. \\n\r\nShe was sometimes so stupid in misunderstanding things and make a problem out of it which was completely unnecessary.  \\n\r\nHe, unfortunately, did the same. It\u2019s like they copy pasted their charactersXD\\n\r\nThen you have the potential rivals\u2026. They were so forced. It\u2019s like they just felt the need to add rivals to the story when it wasn\u2019t really needed. At least make them interesting if you add them. I don\u2019t even know what their personalities were like because they had none. \\n\r\nAlso, the obsession the main character had with her toy was so weird. I thought it was weird from the beginning, like why? \\n\r\nAnd then she bought one for him tooXD\\n\\n\r\nSo, this story was a wasted potential and please don\u2019t watch it if you\u2019re looking for some good romance story. This is not it!!!\\n\r\nYou can watch this with a friend for some comic relief thoughXD\\n",

            "content": "If you're a romance lover and there's always been something unsatisfying about any anime you watched, I can guarantee you're not gonna find it in this one. As you could see in the genres, there are only \"romance\" and \"school\" so if you actually think you need hilarious comedy or extreme action to enjoy an Anime, you might want to pass this one. \r\nThe plot\r\nSomething I've always found annoying is the plot development over time. In RomCom, Action Harem Anime, there's just a guy who gets all the power and all the girls of the world in the first episode. In Shoujo Anime, you gottawait the whole series to see a confession and maybe if you're lucky, a kiss. The development in this one is very realistic and I'm sure that's what romantic souls out there have been searching for. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation\\n\r\nIf you check out some screenshots and teasers, you surely will find the animation quite unique. I would compare it to a movie animation. Actually, the whole setting, the plot and quality of this Anime is very similar to a movie one. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack\\n\r\nI'm not much into soundtracks, I'm of the trash who skips openings and endings but in this anime, all the music was beautiful and very fitting into the scenes.\\n\\n\r\nAspects of originality\\n\r\nAs I said, it is very special Romance Anime, that's original itself. But there's more, something that is just so amazing and would make anyone who watches it go \"LOL, that's so cool\" - it is the fact it's just all so real. The anime is an original work which means there's just a little gap from the initial creation and the release. And especially in this anime, the creators just didn't want to pretend that the characters live in an alternative universe, no, they literally live in 2016. Imagine all the things that were popular and happened in 2016 - you're gonna find them there. This may be a little spoiler but I think it's worth knowing for someone who would consider watching this show. Another very original thing I liked about this one is the little side stories after the ending. \\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nHeartbreaking show that was wonderful and perfect to the very last second. You just have to watch that and remember your childhood romances. \\n\\n",

            "content": "I couldn't bring myself to watch Tsuki ga Kirei at first as the idea of a romance story between two 'middle schoolers' didn't really appeal to me at all. More often or not, I find a good story is more enjoyable when you are able to self-insert, so knowing these characters were somewhere between 13 and 15 years old didn't excite me at all - especially seeing the former age is now a decade past.\r\nFortunately, I was bored enough to give it a go, and as it turned out, Tsuki ga Kirei was nothing like I expected. \r\nRather than a story of self-insertingto find enjoyment and relatability to the characters and their actions, Tsuki ga Kirei is a story that had me reminiscing my school years to heights I've never experienced before. This show managed to captivate me, filling me with nostalgia of my own high school romances, thanks to the brilliantly realistic portrayal of two 15-year old's falling in love.\\n\\n\r\nAkane and Kotarou are two very shy 15-year-olds that appear to pick up an interest for one another the first moment they saw each other. Their shyness truly needs to be emphasised, these two teenagers may never have spoken to one another their whole final year in middle-school had it not been for a series of coincidences and situations leading to them exchanging social media details to help prepare for a upcoming school sports festival.\\n\\n\r\nBoth characters capture exactly what it's like to be a shy teenager falling in love. I don't think I've seen a better representation of shyness in adolescence before in any story I have seen. So often do I see characters that are written to be permanently shy, but that's now how it works in real life. Shyness can come and go in sudden waves, from one moment finding it difficult to say a word, to having a heated and enjoyable conversation the next, only for the shyness to return when you've had enough time to think. Shy people can force themselves when needed to be vocal, even if only temporary, and Tsuki ga Kirei captures that reality of shyness perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nMost impressive to me is the phone messages sent between Akane and Kotarou. While finding difficulty to talk to each other in person at times, their interactions on their social media app were completely different. These conversations were generally filled with confidence and energy. That didn't mean their shyness was gone completely, it was blatantly obvious by their facial expressions and actions those messages were often hard to send and waiting for a reply seemed agonising. Finally, the other party would always be filled with happiness and excitement whenever they got a reply. \\n\\n\r\nAppropriately, their conversations online also appeared to be very, very real. So real, I could swear I've had so many of these conversations myself playing out so similarly in years past. \\n\\n\r\nThe scenes Akane and Kotarou shared were so insanely sweet, more often than not while watching I had a grin from ear to ear. I was so grateful to finally see another anime romance where the relationships begin early, not at the end. It was also enjoyable to see them slowly grow more accustomed to each other as the story went on, finally reaching a point where they could share emotions they wouldn't have dared shown earlier in their relationship.\\n\\n\r\nAs well as the romance, both Akane and Kotarou have their own goals and motivations. Kotarou wants to be a novelist, while Akane is very good at running. These desires for the both of them were often overshadowed by their relationship, however their perceptions of their hobbies do grow as the show goes on.\\n\\n\r\nMoving away from the plot and characters, the story also features some excellent shorts after the credits of most episodes. They typically range anywhere between 10 and 30 seconds each and give an opportunity to flesh out some of the other characters a bit that I often wished had a little more screen time. I think I would really appreciate some OVA's, even if only filled with these shorts.\\n\\n\r\nAround episode seven the animation drops off a bit. It doesn't stay poor permanently, but a few scenes do feel a little incomplete. I can only imagine they will be touched up in a Blu-ray copy later down the line. Given it wasn't for an extended period, and the series is slice of life, not action, I'm compelled to let it slide but it's not something I would have been happy to put up with had it spanned half or more of the show.\\n\\n\r\n It's also worth noting Tsuki ga Kirei is an original project by studio feel. most recently known for their adaptation for the second season of Yahari ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru. The Director, Seiji Kishi, is most notable for his work directing Angel Beats, while script writer Yuuko Kakihara has done scripts for various anime including the recent anime Orange and Sakamichi no Apollon.\\n\\n\r\nAt the very least, I recommend giving it a try, perhaps you'll also be fortunate to get far more than you bargained for as I did.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a conclusive romance that has an actual conclusion that feels almost unrivalled outside of Shoujo and Josei demographics, Tsuki ga Kirei is for you.",

            "content": "OVERALL 10/10:\r\nThis is hands down one of the best romance anime that's out there. For me, it deserves a 10 not only because of an amazing story but because it focuses on a person's first (middle- school ish) relationship. The way they portray it is ridiculously accurate, from embarrassing cringe moments to beautiful innocent ones. I love that this anime focuses on a more wholesome relationship rather than ones that take place in a high school or a fantasy setting.  \r\nART and ANIMATION 6/10:\r\nThe weakest part of this anime is definitely the animation (they were definitely on a budget). There's quite a bit ofartifacts in some scenes, and the CGI they use on \"extras\" or background people is glaringly obvious. I liked the art style itself because it was very unique, but I think many people think it's too jarring. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND/ MUSIC 10/10:\\n\r\nThis is probably where a decent amount of their budget probably went (and I'm glad they did it). They used at least 5 songs from Nao Toyama (singer) at various parts during the story, and they were amazing. The instrumental soundtracks were solid as well, but having a good songs with lyrics that matched the plot/ genre really made a huge impact. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS 9/10:\\n\r\nThe 2 main characters were written beautifully. Some people might say they were a little generic or don't have enough \"uniqueness\" but I think the story focuses more on their relationship and how they build off one another, rather than just developing who they are individually. The side characters are very supportive or are sources of conflict, and their main purpose was to enhance the development of the 2 main characters. However, there are cute little scenes at the end of most episodes that gives development to the side characters. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT 10/10:\\n\r\nI love this anime. It's so wholesome and just makes you feel so fuzzy and warm inside. Conflicts are resolved reasonably quick (no dragging out) and the romance flows very well. If you're on the fence about watching it, please do it. \\n\\n",

The scenes that demand some sort of partnering music have them. In addition, the opening and endings are well done. No complaints in this department.\\n\\n\r\nMaturity and growth is extremely prevalent in this anime. The development of all characters are seen in this story, not just the main characters.

            "content": "Was on a long hiatus from anime and pick this up from a friend's advice, best decision ever! Although I'm late for giving this anime a review but I had to do it. The post effect of this anime is too strong! I'll try to give my best on reviewing this with no spoilers! \r\nNow, let's get into this hidden gem. First off, story. The story pacing is acceptable, some do find it a bit slow but it was just right. Sure, there might be a bit of beating around the bush at the beginning but it was alright. It's has a good introduction butthe flow of the story goes great after that. Every episode feels refreshing and of course, SWEET. The roller-coaster ride for every episode is never dull! I can get diabetes from this anime, seriously. \\n\\n\r\nOnto art style, I like the main characters' design. Though at some scene the art might be a bit out of place but at the very least at some important scenes, they are polished. So there might be some inconsistent there. However, the art is still enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nThe VA and songs are good. The main characters VA seems very well describing the character. For eg. Kotarou is a quiet and shy guy so the soft sound of his when talking suits him. I can't really judge much on art and sound as I'm not really an expert in judging them but none the less, I enjoyed them.\\n\\n\r\nNow the best part, character's development. Perfect. Instead of putting the audience straight into the characters knowing one another and flashing back and forth to the past and present to tell us about their background. The anime starts off with both main characters did not know each other at all but they tend to get curious towards one another.  I felt like this kind of development suits my taste, start from blank slate and move on from there.\\n\\n\r\nAs the anime goes on, they did not rush the development but instead here's where opinion splits, you either feel the pacing is too slow and redundant OR you feel the progression is at its normal satisfactory speed. I'm the later and I truly enjoy such pacing. However, I definitely did not feel anything is rushed inside, but maybe its just me. \\n\\n\r\nNow, I'm just talking about two main characters development. Here comes a rather bad point which is, there's almost no development with OTHER characters. (Maybe there is a little bit but its almost to none) Its always about both of them so you have to be prepared for this if you are not a fan of such development! For one I feel this is not a bad point, the main point of the anime is about the romance of this couple, but don't get me wrong , they do interact with their friends and there are obstacles but they are not as memorable as this couple that constantly supplying free sugar.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, did I enjoy this journey? I sure am! It was hard to say good bye to this anime once I finished it (and I'm not gonna comment how I really feel about the ending, but its almost similar to the majority in the episode discussion, I try not to give out too much too), but it was a fun ride. Thanks for the great time, Tsuki ga Kirei!\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: If you like romance, drama OR slice of life, pick this up immediately and don't put it down until you finish. And once you are done, get your sugar level check. Definitely fun to watch, recommended! 10/10",

            "content": "This anime is super cute. It's a realistic little story about a middle school romance, and although the plot is nothing revolutionary, it's very innocent and adorable and I really liked it. \r\nLike I said, the story is nothing revolutionary. It has basic development and conflict points as many other romance stories, but the way this one handles them is different. It stays true to the middle school setting and resolves problems the way that young and well-meaning children/pre-teens would, making it refreshing to watch. No typical drama here, folks! In addition to the main point of the story (the romance), this anime does agood job showing and integrating various aspects of middle school life and the interests of such a demographic, as well as the common problems this demographic shares. I missed my youth while watching this!\\n\\n\r\nThe characters also well reflect their age, in terms of their behaviour, speech, and interests. Not only this, but the characters are pretty well developed. Character development wasn't a huge part of the story, so they didn't dive deep into this aspect, but they did flesh them out quite well. One of the ways they did this was by showing the behaviours and scenes around them. For example (and this isn't a spoiler), the main character Azumi likes boxing. We're very obviously introduced to his love of literature, but boxing is an interest that comes more subtly. It is introduced to us from how his friends act around him (tackling him, for example), from how he mock-boxes with this thing on his lamp (you'll see if you watch the anime), and from the Muhammad Ali poster in his room. I found this method of introducing character to be super cool. \\n\\n\r\nThe only thing is, I wasn't a huge fan of was the art. The cut scenes were by-far the worst, with poor 3D animation done, but if you skip those parts it isn't that bad\u2014just not my cup of tea. \\n\\n\r\nSo, in conclusion, it's a pretty sweet show. If you're craving something innocent and cute, this is definitely something you should check out. \\n\\n\r\nPS\u2014I LOVED THE ENDING. Very well executed.",

It has a lot of individual pieces that makes it an amazing \"whole\", with one of the best character developments I have seen in this spring season it captivates the viewer to see how all of the characters grow before their eyes.\r\nEven though it does not have the best character art, \"the scenery art\" is truly mesmerizing and amazing, the use of the colors to drive the mood of the audience is outstanding and so is the music.\r\nThe story is not the typical \"lead male character has every girl in the school fall forhim, but he only wants the awkward one\" clich\u00e9, instead Kotarou (the male lead) could easily be a secondary character, and he doesn't need much to get to the viewer as he makes it worth with every action he takes.\\n\\n\r\nAmazing story, only 12 episodes to make it perfect, not rushed, just amazing!

            "content": "Story (8/10):\r\nA love story that was a simple, heartwarming, and  a little cute at times. The progress of the romance was well paced and simplified. It was not over dramatic and didn't use any drastic methods, more realistic and down to earth in my opinion. The emphasis on the chat program (LINE) was a nice idea (Last credit scene with the changing of the contact names was kind of sweet)\r\nleaving the comedic stuff and other relationships out of the show and putting them out as little sketches after credit scenes was a smart choice too it let the viewer focus on the actual story.Those scenes were fun to watch though.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10):\\n\r\nThe progress for the main characters was well done. Two middle schoolers noticing each other and starting off nervous and awkward and then getting more and more accustomed to being around each other and finding solace in confiding in one another and giving moral support and then falling in love. Like i said it was really simple and the good kind of simple.\\n\r\nThe show didn't really focus that much on the side characters but they were will done and did the job properly, supporting the progress of the story and the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation (8/10):\\n\r\nThe backgrounds and environments were beautiful and really well drawn, colorful and warm and really suited the show vibe and helped with setting the mood, and he characters looked nice as well.\\n\r\nAnimations ranged from robotic CG stuff in crowded areas to sharp and detailed when it comes to more focused scenes.\\n\\n\r\nMusic & VA (8/10):\\n\r\nThe show was heavy on the sweet and fuzzy sound tracks making sure that you know what kind of show it is :D the songs were nice and with the combination with the warm art the mood was set nicely for the show\\n\r\nVoice acting was nice although there was not that much talking in the show in general but still there was not annoying sounding characters which is good.\\n\\n\r\nEffectiveness (8/10):\\n\r\nIt was a sweet ride and had a good amount of heartwarming feels. The simplified story and progress was a good point in my book and made the show more enjoyable and the comedic sketches were a nice touch \\n\r\nIt was  good show  all around that i would totally recommend to anyone looking for a good romance anime that is not over dramatic and more down to earth.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10)",

            "content": "What set's Tsuki ga Kirei apart from most of the typical middle school, slice-of-life romance shows is the sheer realism of the story.  None of the characters, neither the main or the supporting, are stereotypical tropes or even have one single, blaring personality trait that makes them different than someone else.\r\nThe beauty of this story is that these are two characters who have a chance encounter in the first episode and awkwardly go from crush to a relationship.  They have no idea what they are really doing and both at times feel awkward around one another as they figure out how they conducttheir relationship.  Their ease at talking over a text message as opposed to in real life is something familiar to a lot of kids their age.  And the series demonstrates this communication effectively and realistically.  The use of the stickers and even the animation of Akane's phone shaking because she hits the screen pretty hard are all great at building a world that we can relate to.  \\n\\n\r\nThere is no huge stakes in this series, unlike comparable shows like Your Lie In April, but that doesn't mean there isn't drama and once again it is so real it feels fresh.  The conflicts arise in determining if they are a couple, what their feelings are, how/if they tell their friends about their relationship and how they interact in front of them.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style while nothing special, is not distracting.  The music is also a little forgettable but it does still set the mood.  If there is one criticism I could make of the show it is the side stories at the end that explore the tertiary characters.  Very few of the characters, besides Kotaro and Akane, get much development and while some show some promise at being interesting, they get almost no screen time.  Considering the series is only twelve episodes, because the show is so focused on it's two leads, it may have benefits from a few extra minutes to perhaps give us more of them.  But that's a really minor quibble.\\n\\n\r\nThis is definitely one of the better slice of life shows and if you want are really looking for a story driven show with intimate character portrayals, this is one to watch.",

            "content": "Tsuki ga Kirei, as of the date of its finishing episode, seems very much to be a sleeper hit. \r\nNow, I don't watch a lot of romance shows but I decided at the start of the season 'hey this looks cute, I'm sure this'll be a good way to pass time' and then, lo and behold, it became what will probably be my favourite show of the year, possible even my favourite show ever. \r\nThe story has a simple premise, first love high school romance but it's all in the execution. The story is focused on the characters, as a romance should, and talking abouta character driven tale without actually mentioning the characters, sound or animation would be nigh impossible. The story, as stated, is simple but relatable and the way it presents itself seems very refreshing especially with the two main characters hooking up before the end of the series which isn't all too common in romance series. \\n\\n\r\nThe art/animation is probably the worst part of the series but it's in no way bad. The backgrounds are very detailed and the animation is at its best when there are two characters, typically the main ones, talking. It has a look to it that makes it seem like it was made with the thought of it looking like a movie which did, at least to me, wonders in ways of production. The worst part of the animation would be the CG background characters in many scenes. They don't look outlandishly bad and there's never any focus on them so don't worry about this too much. The general animation, with the exception of the above mentioned, is what you should expect from a TV anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are very simple yet they remain distinct from each other. They're very realistic and they don't break the immersion of the story. The characters, as per usual, change clothes as the seasons continue and they all go together well. There's also the occasional hairstyle change. \\n\\n\r\nThere's a decent amount of characters in general but the main focuses here will be Azumi and Akane, our protagonists. Let's start with Azumi. Azumi comes across, especially at the beginning, as a very awkward kid among his peers who's often very passive at the way people act towards him and gets embarrassed easily. Among his friend group though, he is a bit more open and often yells (softly) at them when they tease him and give him grief over something. He also has his fair share of quirks, interests and friends outside of Akane. Firstly, he has two friends both of whom he is seen interacting with and talking to at various points throughout the series, both with distinct personalities and designs that make the world feel that much more real. A quirk that's often made a point of showing up his when he shadow boxes with the chord to his bedroom lights, which joins with the roughhousing of his friends. He has a deep interest in literature and seems to love the works of Dazai Osamu, a famous Japanese author, often quoting him  during separate parts of the series. His family is also present throughout the show, giving him grief over his studies and future alongside encouraging him at several points in the show. \\n\r\nAkane, our other protagonist, is very much similar at the start of the series as she is shown to be rather awkward, although a bit more loudly spoken than Azumi, and she's easily embarrassed. Among her peers she's shown to be very open with her emotions, especially more so as the series progresses, and she seems to have a bigger friend group than Azumi. Her friend group consists mainly of girls, with one male who serves as a minor block in the road for her and Azumi's relationship alongside one female within her friend group that serves the same purpose. At school she's shown to have above average grades and she's the ace of the track team. One of her quirks includes using a beanbag creature to relieve her stress. Her family life consists of her parents and a sister, all of whom serve as a driving force and give another layer to her character as she interacts differently with her parents compared to her sister compared to her friends and so on. \\n\r\nI mentioned a male and female road in the block that are within Akane's friend group and I think that they deserve notable mention for the purpose they serve. Despite largely seeming to exist for a specific purpose they're given enough personality and interactions outside of the specific purpose to make them seem more integrated into the world and more as if they could actually exist. A lot of people don't seem to like them for how they end up going about things but I think otherwise and I think it's important to note that they're just kids that do what they do to give themselves peace of mind and are great characters in their own right.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is one of the things that makes the series. It's not that the soundtrack is particularly amazing or memorable, though it is very nice, but it's in the use of sound. There are many times in which there is no sound, just visuals with the main purpose to make you stressed or to make you worried. There are moments when the music is playing then stops or the opposite happens and it's all used very effectively to play with how you feel at that moment. \\n\\n\r\nTsuki ga Kirei, at its core, is a heart warming (and sometimes heartbreaking) coming of age romance story with realism highly valued and characters used fully to the advantage of the plot.",

            "content": "Tsuki ga Kirei is an anime that does nothing special. This may sound like a damning indictment, but then why have you given it a ten? For the simple reason that by not trying to overextend itself this anime manages to do nearly everything it tries with perfection. This is a love story that could be told to anyone anywhere and they would be able to relate in some way, almost like a modern day fairytale.\r\nStory: 10\r\nThe story for Tsuki ga Kirei takes the generic tale of two students in Japan but fills it with characters that the show will make you love and hate.The progression is not the blistering pace of some anime but is also not the snail's crawl of others, it has a perfect pacing. The main obstacles are very clearly set out and each character's motivation is always well conveyed and relatable.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nThe art for this show has one major detraction, the characters in the background are often CGI'd in and it is VERY obvious. Unfortunately, this can ruin some of the background art which is always very picturesque. The characters who are not CGI abominations are very stylised but this works really well with the aesthetic the show is trying to go for.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nThe sound for this show is very good, my main praise has to be for the sound effects which all seem to mesh with the art style to create a stylised world. The line sound effect will make you check your phone at least once. All the characters fit their voice actors and the music is very good at setting the mood that they want.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nThe characters of Tsuki ga Kirei is where it stands out. These characters feel very real and it is the little details in what they do that helps to flesh this out. Whenever the main boy is excited he will start boxing with the light cord dangling from his ceiling. It is small details like this that raise your immersion into this world and this anime has it in droves.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nTsuki ga Kirei is not the most action packed anime, it does not get you pumped up or excited. Instead, it keeps up enjoyment by giving you a believable couple that you want to root for. It gives you an MC who is not incompetent in everything they do who you want to succeed. It gives you a leading girl who is not just waiting for MC to do everything for her but is her own character with a motivation of her own. At the end of each episode you can't help but want to know more, you can't help but want to know what happens to these two.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nIn media it is very easy to take the emotions of someone and force them to be something. Kill the main character and that is sad. The main character gets what they want and you play uplifting music and that is happy. Tsuki ga Kirei instead tells its story and lets you decide how to feel about that, you can put yourself in the shoes of most none background characters in this show and understand how they feel. If you don't like romance anime then you won't like this one but if you do like it then this is a must watch.",

The show pulled at my heartstrings with its main and extremely cute yet awkward couple who get closer thanks to messaging app known as line. The show moves at a slow pace and this works really well here as it shows you just how slow the relationship progresses between the main couple, and how it speeds up towards the end.\r\nThere are no major problems in the show and I don't want to be one to nitpick. The 3D did bug me a little inthe beginning but it never got overbearing as the background characters in large scenes were usually the only ones in 3D and only for a very short period of time.\\n\\n\r\nTsukigaKirei is incredibly cute, innocent, and lovely.

            "content": "I don't think I've ever seen an anime as realistic in its portrayal of first love than Tsuki ga Kirei. It absolutely nails it on the head in all the right ways, ranging from the awkward texting, even more awkward \"post-confession\" day, and steady growth of trust and comfort between the two parties. The way it handles character interaction and character growth are pretty much unrivaled when it comes to anime similar to it. How does it do these things so well? Well, it starts by knowing what it is and sticking exactly to that the entire time. It doesn't try to be anything morethan a simple love story between two tyros who've never been with someone who loved them back. This makes it truly effective at relaying exactly what it wants to say and how it wants to say it.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, it's not flawless. While deliberately and precisely executed in its narrative, the art and supporting cast suffer in that they are both underdeveloped. In the art department, it's very clear to anyone who's seen quality animation that many corners were cut to save on cost; for example, extensive use of CG character models for background characters (and sometimes even foreground characters, believe it or not) is absolutely rampant throughout this anime and almost no measures were taken to make it look more convincing than what it is. Also, the scenery, while stylized, is clearly not hand-drawn or in high resolution. It comes out blotchy and blurry at times, particularly when it needed to be layered in order for characters to pass through the middle ground. The supporting cast is there at times for the protagonists to lean on but don't develop much as individuals at all. The character designs themselves aren't particularly interesting either, but this isn't a negative as this was clearly the intention to add to the already substantial realism. \\n\\n\r\nTsuki ga Kirei excels at exactly what it wants to, and that's crafting a simple yet beautiful and innocent love story that's presented and develops in a believable and highly realistic way. It does this through minimal spoken dialogue and scarce use of background music, particularly during normal conversation scenes. It gives the anime a sense of visceral unpredictability which runs parallel with reality. It does what it sets out to do and that's exactly why it succeeds so well, because it doesn't focus on making the story bigger or more interesting by throwing curveballs to keep the audience's attention. While it may seem mundane and boring to some, Tsuki ga Kirei is undeniably realistic and relatable in every sense in its portrayals of developing feelings and first time romance.",

I mourn over the possibility that there might never be a romance anime this good, ever again.\r\nHeads up: this is my first review, and I am heavily biased towards this show.\r\nWell, let's begin.\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nI had about 10 heart attacks, might've had more while unconscious. The ending makes it all worthwhile, though. It's like eating the food of the gods after walking through the Sahara for years...\r\nOkay, seriously. The story was great; very realistic. No bs anime stereotypes. In fact, you are hit with many surprises each time because of its tendency to throw you offwith its utmost, realistic, down-to-earth simplicity. No boobs flopping around everywhere.\\n\r\nWarning: it does give you high stress/anxiety levels in the middle. Beginning and end are great though.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThe art was simple. But one sentence in particular comes to mind when I think about Tsuki ga Kirei's art: \"A picture can express a thousand words.\"\\n\r\nThe characters don't spew unnecessary shit. Their facial expressions tell it all.\\n\r\nMaybe a bit too plain though, so it gets a 9; nonetheless, one of the best art I've ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nWow. Just wow.\\n\r\nLet me say one thing: every time I listen to the opening and ending of this anime, I almost cry.\\n\r\nVery, very, soothing, melancholy, whatever fits the mood...\\n\\n\r\n... Ok I'm trying not to have a panic attack from reminiscing about this\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nMizuno, always so sweet, how can you be sweeter than candy~ ah!\\n\r\nKotarou, wow! Showcases the true emotions of a teenager in love~ ah!\\n\r\nHira fuck off\\n\r\nChinatsu, I'm sorry this is not a hentai and you cannot have a threesome with the MCs. I am truly sorry. I want to see her happy.\\n\\n\r\nBest side ship: Roman x Ryouko-sensei, please have them marry in (an impossible) 2nd season\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI broke in the last episode. I cried. It was great. My heart and ass felt liberated. What else can I say?\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n10/10. This replaced my #1 romance anime, Kaichou wa Maid-sama. Takumi Usui is still my standard for all boys tho (I'm a straight male) hmph.\\n\\n\r\nFor real though, I cannot express in fitting words my gratitude towards everyone who worked on Tsuki ga Kirei. Thank you for one of the most enjoyable experiences in my entire life. Thank you once more. Have I said thank you yet?\\n\\n\r\nI want more though. I can wait as long as it takes.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading.",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS\r\n-Story\r\nWhen talking about anime, the genre of school life may be too common. Nevertheless, despite the theme of school life which many other anime have already used, Tsuki ga Kirei is able to bring this genre very well made, even the simple story becomes the main charm of this anime. If another anime tries to bring a complex plot with many characters, this anime uses only two main characters and tells about two people who are in love, Kotarou and Akane. Each character has a good story development and no plot holes are happening. The expression and personality of each character isalso not excessive, from behavior to gesture and facial expressions that are natural so it looks realistic, no characters are behaving like common anime personality, such as tsundere, kuudere, or other dere-dere.\\n\\n\r\nStories are also brought with no rush, instead slowly but surely that makes the development of the story more detailed. The first time Kotarou and Akane accidentally met at the restaurant with their families for example, how they still don\u2019t know each other and only seeing each other at school. From that meeting the two began to show their interest and their relationship began to grow. At first they were still embarrassed to greet each other and just look from a distance. This is where the role of social media plays an important role in their story. Throughout the story, LINE became a place where the two showed expression and then brought their relationship closer, until they finally decided to meet. What's interesting is when they meet it turns out they are both still embarrassed to look at each other and also not dare to talk, making both end up just mutually silent and awkward. Perhaps some people are irritated when they see it, but if you look at the reality now, young people are more open when chatting through social media than when chatting directly, making the expression of Kotarou and Akane can be practically natural and realistic.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes it different again from other anime is there are family relationship in this anime. Generally, in other anime school life the premise is the main character living alone in his apartment or left by their family to work abroad. It can also have a family, but not put into the story. In this anime it is shown how the families of the two characters interact with each other like the family used to be in reality. As in the Kotarou family for example. His mother didn\u2019t want him to be a writer because it\u2019s an uncertain career, but his father was understanding with him and allowed him to freely choose his future even though sometimes his mother scolded his father because of it. Or when Kotarou was determined to try to enroll in the same school as Akane, but didn\u2019t get approval from his mother because the school had high academic standards, whereas he didn\u2019t have good academic grades, making him start quarrel with his mother. The family relationship also shown with the Akane family, especially her sister who often jokes with her and giving advice about her love life, as well as when her family decides to move away because of her father\u2019s work, and also to get closer to Akane's new school, thus forcing Kotarou and Akane to start long distance relationship.\\n\\n\r\nThe role of a side character is also delivered properly, not forced in the story making it out of place. Their role also gives influence in the character development of Kotarou and Akane, making them become an important role in this Anime. For example, friends of the Akane\u2019s track and field team, Chinatsu and Takumi. Chinatsu who is interested in Kotarou, and Takumi who has been liked Akane for long, raises a love triangle among them. This is where Kotarou and Akane characters develop, how they experience jealousy and heartbreak, as when Akane sees Chinatsu approaching Kotarou, or when Kotarou sees Takumi close to Akane, causing mutual suspicion between the two and being unsure of their relationship. Nevertheless, the conflicts are also match to the personality of Kotarou and Akane, how those two prefer to bury their feelings and not dare to directly interfere and eventually quarrel in the LINE. Nevertheless, the drama given in this anime is not excessive and delivered with a natural pace. There is no forced expression and dialogue.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, the side activities of the two characters also became important for their future, such as Akane who joined the track and field team at school and got a recommendation at a high school who has good track and field activity, making Kotarou intend to take the entrance test at same school as Akane. Or Kotarou who participated in the festival activities in his city and intend to be a writer with a guide from Daisuke, a friend of his festivals activities. What's interesting about this anime is when the epilogue is told in a timeline about the journey of Kotarou and Akane relationship after graduating from middle school and having long distance relationship until they finally get married and have a children, making the story fully complete and give a sense of satisfaction because the audience saw how both of them eventually became a family and ended happily.\\n\\n\r\n-Visual\\n\r\nArt and visual provided by this Anime has a natural touch in the design of his character, how in each character have nothing misplaced or strange design, like a natural hair color, no colorful hair (except Roman), then as well as the physical posture of each character adjusted to their age, such as Kotarou and Akane who have postures and faces like a middle school student in general, there are no characters who have strange and excessive look, no loli and trap (thank god). Then the background art is also described with simple and natural and in accordance with the character design, so it can strengthen the atmosphere in the story.\\n\\n\r\n-Music\\n\r\nThe soundtrack in this anime is successful in making this anime comfortable to follow. How the music in this anime can create an peace and relax atmosphere, and played in precisely with the scenes in the story so that the audience who watch it feel comfortable and carried away with the atmosphere in the anime. Then there are also some scenes that have no background music to focus on sound effects, which of course can cause a feeling like inside the anime. The soundtrack is also nice, like one of the songs from Kiroro in a particular scene for example.\\n\\n\r\n-Conclusion\\n\r\nThis anime is more focused on the simple story rather than complex story. Although simple, it become a story that different from other anime. I\u2019m really enjoyed in watching this anime, and also sometimes remembering my old times because of stories that can be said like stories on everyday life, stories about the natural relationship in school, and that I have not found in the anime else, so this anime is suitable for you who seek in terms of novelty.",

            "content": "Plot: \r\nThe plot does an excellent job of depicting a middle school relationship. It was actually so accurate, that I found myself drawing many comparisons from my own middle school relationships. However, I think that the plot itself was just too bland and basic. The beginning is very slow, as it takes a long time for the relationship to progress. When the relationship finally does get rolling, nothing interesting really ever happens. It all seems to go so swimmingly. There are a few moments where conflict introduced for the sake of switching the tone, and it never felt quite earned. The conflicts that occur arealso resolved pretty much out of the blue with no effort from either main character. The plot also seems to completely prioritize the main characters. This is fine on its own, but it feels very forced when every side character is only introduced for the purpose of directing the plot in one way or another. No other side character introduced is given any additional context or anything except when it's related to the main characters, making them feel entirely unauthentic. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\\n\r\nThe main characters are incredibly boring, and each show very little personality at all besides being quiet, awkward, and passionate about their respective club. Is this realistic and are their plenty of middle school students like this? Absolutely. Is it entertaining to watch. Not really. There's some development between their interactions with each other, but their personalities don't really change or branch out. The side characters are all far more lively than them, but none of them are given enough screen time to show anything memorable, or if they are given screen time its only for the purposes of the plot, and not developing them at all. Overall, I'd have to say Tsuki ga Kirei has some of the most two-dimensional, bland, and unentertaining characters I've ever watched in anime. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\\n\r\nThe art for the show is decent. It has a vibe that everything is very positive and organized. It looks good, but sometimes it doesn't depict whats actually happening. For instance, there will be points in which characters will make a comment about someones appearance, but it doesn't look like that at all on the character model. The art style is also inconsistent because sometimes they will use CG and realistic models, which often looks awkward and out of place. However, most of the time, it look of very high quality. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound/Music:\\n\\n\r\nThe music and sound are probably the best thing out of the show. Tsuki ga Kirei does a great job of not using music all the time to convey emotion, and instead simply using silence. This a very welcome change and makes the show feel far more realistic because its not having some magic love song play every time the characters are alone. There's also a good variety of tracks. I never felt like I was hearing the same song repeatedly. The sound effects were also well done. There was a point where a train quietly rolled by and I legitimately thought that it was right behind me. Overall, I was very impressed with the sound. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nWhile I found this anime to be grounded and an incredibly accurate depiction of these types of relationships at this point in an individuals life, I couldn't help be feel that it was too bland. I just never felt anything for this show because I didn't feel anything unique or interesting coming from it, other than the realism. \\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nRegardless of my feelings about how bland most of the show feels, I can't deny that there are some people who will enjoy this. There aren't too many romance anime this well grounded in reality. If a very by the book middle school romance sounds like your thing, then you should probably check out this anime. \\n\\n",

            "content": "I actually didn\u2019t intend on watching this initially, nor was I even aware of it when it aired. But after watching Just Because! and really enjoying the type of story it told, I went to the recommendations tab for shows that were similar, and Tsuki Ga Kirei was not only what users thought was the most similar, but was also a show that aired in Spring 2017, so I decided to pick it up and watched on a flight back to the UK. \r\nLets just say, it was the best flight I\u2019ve ever had in my life at that point.\r\nThe show follows two protagonists, aboy named Kotarou and a girl named Akane. The show is mainly about the relationship of these two protagonists who and their time during their final year in middle school. In it, we see their meetings, interactions, and growth with their fellow classmates. It\u2019s a show about that time in middle school where you begin to find yourself, your purpose, and others to care about. They go through different stages of growth and learn different lessons as they change, dealing with relationships with themselves as well as others in one of the most wonderful romantic coming of age stories I\u2019ve ever seen. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\\n\r\nIn the new Japanese semester that begins in Spring, the cherry blossoms bloom a beautiful pink hue. In the location of Daisan Middle School, where the feeling of a new start and a new stressful school year can be felt all around. In this time, a boy named Kotarou and a girl named Akane are introduced, and are both pitted into the class of Class 3-1. We quickly learn that they are introverted by nature, but also have a number of friends and family members that support them. After school, they run into each other at a restaurant and meet face to face due to a number of coincidences. After their initial awkward introduction, they are initially a bit trepid from talking to one another. However, due to curiosity and certain feelings they may have, they eventually get to properly get acquainted with each other, and become new friends that often message each other on LINE.\\n\\n\r\nThe show then follows these two characters as our protagonists, and their final year of high school together. After their fated meeting, they then develop their relationship, bit by bit, learning more about themselves and each other while gradually building their bond step by step. They are easily the main driving point of the story, as this show mainly focuses on the relationship of these two protagonists, and their time during their final year in middle school. In it, we see their meetings, interactions, and growth with their fellow classmates. The show is a slice of life romance and coming of age show about maturing and change, as this is because it\u2019s time where most teens have to break out of their shells and begin to find themselves as well as start planning their life.\\n\\n\r\nSomething I want to bring up about the show\u2019s tone, is that it\u2019s heavily grounded in realism. What do I mean by that? It\u2019s simply that the show is extremely realistic, where no characters feel overly fictional or the plot doesn\u2019t have extra drama or exaggeration. It\u2019s grounded in a realistic scenario with views that reflect such. The interactions between characters and the multiple events that are really similar to that of real life, and due to this, the things that happen are really tangible. The plot in general, as well as another factor, makes this show very easy to both understand and emphasise with. \\n\\n\r\nThe reactions and plot points in it feel like an ideal, yet real story about the relationship between a boy and a girl. It may feel a bit romanticised in a way, maybe with the main pair acting too innocent for the culture of modern age. But I see this show as being able to be a bit idealistic with this take, yet at the same time, able to capture the feeling of natural teenage love and romance, through taking that ideal golden pathway to happiness. Regardless, I argue that the show overall still remains grounded to earth despite this, and feels genuinely real throughout. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe art is unique for an anime, upon first seeing it, you might think that it\u2019s a more simpler style without too much to talk about, and in some areas, that holds true. The characters are mostly simple, with mostly average, simple designs without a lot of facial detail that don\u2019t make them stand out from one another. The characters themselves take a minimalistic design approach, with simple colors and designs that do not stand out from the crowd. In fact, with the exception of Roman, don\u2019t expect a lot of wacky anime hair colors that most other anime may have, because this show does not do that very often. Even our own two protagonists look just as bland as the rest of the cast, and would blend in perfectly in a group picture without standing out. However, this simpler and normalised take on the character designs, helps them feel even more realistic overall as they feel like normal humans. This makes the immersion more convincingly real in the end, which is something I appreciate Feel doing.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, upon closer inspection, you\u2019ll find that the art does have considerable detail when it wants to, specifically in the backgrounds. The art overall is reminiscent of a watercolor drawing, not always the most consistent, but it\u2019s pastel colorscheme and it\u2019s shading allows things to feel pretty despite this. It\u2019s a style that takes a bit to get used to, but you can really learn to appreciate it over time. Animation itself for the most part is simple or minimalistic, as this is not a show that really requires any insane movements or such. It\u2019s just a simple story above love and finding yourself, and thus it stays normal enough to accomodate that tone. However, some may find this a bit off-putting, as the characters and background have different art style philosophies, some may find that the styles clash a bit with one another. I certainly did upon watching the first episode, and I\u2019m sure others could find gripe with it as well. \\n\\n\r\nThere are two aspects of the art style that I could consider a negative, one which I think is mostly objective and brings down the art a mark. First of all, is the shading. You\u2019ll quickly notice that the shading style of the characters also take a minimalistic approach, and instead of having lots of hues and colorations to make something look more realistic, the show sticks with it\u2019s minimalistic art style, and only has two or three shades for a certain area. You\u2019ll find large blotches of one color in an area, especially for the characters, which is what gives the show it\u2019s minimalistic art style impression. Feel also decided to put areas of white on the characters in the show, which is done to replicate the reflection of the sun or light while remaining with the minimalistic art. Needless to say, that white sometimes breaks the illusion of the character models, and could look really off to some people, I personally got used to it pretty quick, but it is something to take note of.\\n\\n\r\nThe actual problem with the art though is the sparing use of CGI animation they used in certain scenes for people walking, mostly background characters or extras. I get it, budget is a thing and they needed to save it, and animating tens to hundreds of characters is difficult with 2D animation. But frankly, the 3D animation in this is no Land of the Lustrous. It looks absolutely awful and sticks out like a sore thumb on the 2D backgrounds. There\u2019s no defending it, it looks bad and feels extremely off-putting. Even the animation itself is robotic and stiff, it\u2019s like they didn\u2019t even try to animate those parts and just made them all follow a pre-done walk cycle. It sucks, and I doubt most people can ignore it. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe sound of the show is quite normal itself. The sound effects aren\u2019t super stylised or need to be brought attention to, they\u2019re simple and do the job, nothing big here. What does need to be brought up are the OSTs and tracks. The OST captures a feeling of elegance and beauty, especially with it\u2019s piano or woodwind tracks. Some tracks convey an air of mystery, while others cary an air of peacefulness and satisfaction. None of the songs here are blood boiling or exciting, like the show, it\u2019s just a peaceful everyday tune, as grounded as the characters and life is. \\n\\n\r\nThe OST does an effective job of setting their scenes, and the use of piano is especially effective in touching scenes (as it\u2019s always). The opening for the show is my favorite track here, Nao Toyama gives a great performance that reflects the feeling of discourse and energy of being happy and enjoying your life with someone you love during the free teenage years. With that, the ending contrasts that with a slow, sweet melody, that feels heartfelt yet feels like it\u2019s full of passion and true emotion, like love, and I\u2019m sure that if you like this, you\u2019ll be crying to this song by the end of the series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\\n\r\nThis segment played a huge part in the show due to the nature of it, and I\u2019m happy to say that Feel managed to deliver on this part. First off, as I\u2019ve said before, the show is very realistic, and that especially shows in this part. First off, lets get the most important ones out of the way, our main characters Kotarou and Akane are absolutely fantastic, near perfect I\u2019d argue. First off, they\u2019re immediately extremely relatable to us from their introverted nature. They are characters that deal with their own lives and relationships in it, and worry about issues like embarrassment, peer pressure, and awkwardness around others. Their personalities, choices, and actions in the show aren\u2019t exaggerated, and thus makes them feel like real  human beings that are easy to understand and emphasise with. \\n\\n\r\nObviously at first, our protagonists are not immediately friends. They ran into each other by coincidence, and while they clearly showed mild interest or attraction to one another, they didn\u2019t act on it instantly and avoided each other for a bit in fear of awkwardness or leaving bad impressions. However, they eventually meet again and slowly become acquainted with one another before becoming proper friends, and it wasn\u2019t dragged out at all. Their growth from strangers to friends in the first two episodes alone felt perfectly done, without moments that were exaggerated, shortened, or prolonged. It felt like a realistic situation of two people meeting each other and becoming friends, and that\u2019s the beauty of it. Their growth is extremely realistic without anything changed, making it easy to understand and feel their relationship develop genuinely.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the show, they keep growing together, eventually becoming an awkward couple, and strengthening that bond every episode. They grow together, and seeing their relationship with one another is adorable. Their relationship felt realistic, like if true love truly exists in this world, then their story would be a perfect telling of it. This makes it extremely easy to get attached to them, as their relationship was simply a lovely one. We as the viewers got to see it bud, bloom, and grow ever larger as the show goes on, and it all felt genuine. I seriously got attached to them as a couple, and related to it. The show managed to make me smile and root for them when I\u2019d see their adorable interactions day by day, and it lead for some really cute and heartwarming moments. \\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s not all the show has to offer though, as the side characters are quite prevalent for a show that focuses mostly on it\u2019s main characters. There are a lot of major, supporting, and extra, side characters and they all play their uses well. One great thing about them is that each of them have distinct, unique, and believable personalities. Both the friends of each of the protagonists, their families, and especially major supporting characters all are convincing with how they react and handle situations just like the main duo. They do sometimes exaggerate certain interactions in the minor supporting cast for comedic value, especially in the many shorts that the show has, but overall everyone just feels human, and that holds especially for the major supporting characters. Characters like Chinatsu, Tachibana, and even the parents to Kotarou are fleshed out, real, and have a solid semblance of likeable characteristics despite the focus not being on them most of the time. This is a really good thing, and it makes these extra characters feel even more likeable. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nI have always been a fan of romance shows, but what I enjoy about it isn\u2019t any drama, craziness or coincidences like a lot of romcoms like to do. No, the reason I love romance is to emphasise and care for the characters and their story of falling in love. A romance show that I enjoy simply needs to tell a tale of convincing love, one that feels natural, maybe fated to the point that it feels ideal. Regardless, watching certain characters fall in love with one another simply by being with each other over time is cute and heartwarming, especially seeing what they do once they become a couple.\\n\\n\r\nTsuki Ga Kirei delivered on that so goddamn well. The fact that the characters and story was written in a way that felt not only realistic but also unexaggerated was two big positives that kept me interested and feeling comfortable throughout the show. Watching the characters grow and develop through their final high school year through each other and other people was very pleasant to watch, and seeing the characters grow stronger and become more open with one another felt sweet. \\n\\n\r\nThe real seller for me was that the romance in the show felt very genuine, it started off as mere attraction, but as the pair grew more accustomed and used to one another, they begin to open up more, show care for each other more, and grow into a strong, loving couple that feels like it could last forever. It\u2019s these types of romances that I gravitate to as they feel realistic yet are so perfect in a way that it almost feels hard to obtain in the real world. But unlike many romances in anime, it doesn\u2019t feel impossible or too farfetched. It\u2019s idealised, but it still feels like many people can obtain that ideal happiness, which is really pleasant to think about. The couple led for a plethora or heartwarming and touching scenes that made me feel happy and relaxed inside, and that\u2019s why I love this show so much. It delivers exactly what I look for in a romance, without adding anything that it doesn\u2019t need to, and that is why I feel like it resonates with me so well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\nTsuki Ga Kirei is a beautiful show from beginning to end, at the very least I found it to be so. From the beginning, the show gently lets you get yourselves used to the characters enough to understand them and their life at the current point. Soon after you get used to them, you see the characters get used to their new lives and the new people that enter them. You\u2019ll see Kotarou and Akane meet for the first time, and begin their relationship that develops immensely as the show goes on. They\u2019ll meet and interact with friends from each other\u2019s parties, and soon you\u2019ll become acquainted with them as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe show\u2019s main bread and butter is of course it\u2019s main protagonists Kotarou and Azumi. As this is a romance show, the show focuses on their relationship together as they grow together throughout the series. The characters develop in the show, yet it doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s outwardly development that happened due to supernatural circumstances, but instead just the growth of two teens finding their place in life and getting used to the people around them, while dealing with change. The couple in this show are both convincing and easy to emphasise with, and that truly lead to some really heartwarming and even tearjerking moments. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not just heartwarming due to the romance alone however, the relationships our protagonists have with other characters like their family and friends also have their strong moments. Yet it all still feels realistic, tangible and relatable, and everything just allows for a very heartwarming, realistic come of age story. It\u2019s so realistic that they constantly put in product placement for LINE! There\u2019s even short, comedic little sidestories that happen by the end of every 2 episodes that adds some bonus entertainment should you be curious about some of the quirky interactions between the side characters. \\n\\n\r\nOverall as a fan of romances that feel tangible and are easy to emphasise with, this is one of my favorites in the genre. I came into this show expecting thinking I\u2019d like it about as much as Just Because!, as the recommendations on MAL were what got me interested enough to watch it in the first place. But I ended up loving this show so much more than what I expected. It captured the feeling of true love, the confusing nature of finding yourself at that age, and maintaining positive relationships with your friends. It captured the beauty of an ideal teen life for me, and that's a reason I emphasised with it so much. It got me to cry, and that\u2019s a sign alone that I had an unforgettable experience with this. I highly urge any person to watch this, especially those who wants a relaxing warm romance. This is top of the trophy case, it was fantastic and gave me the best flight I\u2019ve ever had.",

            "content": "\u201cWhat I couldn\u2019t believe, is that someone I had loved, actually loved me back\u201d\r\nGrowing older we all look back at our past relationships and especially growing up in the west it just isn\u2019t as romantic as we imagined it to be. Sure some of us stay with childhood sweethearts however the term chivalry is dead seems to apply more often than not, in this respect Tsuki ga kirei would be the romance that most of us wish we had. A truly beautiful love story coated with a very re-playable lullaby type soundtrack that almost seems too incredible to be real, and yet realism is ingrainedfrom beginning to end. \\n\\n\r\nThough this won\u2019t be for everyone and I for one appreciate and respect how our tastes all vary, however if you\u2019re willing to sit through the awkward silences and artistic visual breaks in the main story my belief is that most viewers will come to appreciate this touching story of adolescent love. When I say realism is ingrained within the story I don\u2019t use the phrase lightly, remembering that these are 2 very young adolescent teens (Kotar\u014d Azumi and Akane Mizuno) both in the midst of junior high school and converging onto their main high schools; the awkward silences between them, the words stuck in their throats, blushing from holding hands or with a small kiss, as well as the jealousy from seeing each other with members of the opposite sex are all very real situations used to brilliant effect. \\n\\n\r\nIf your familiar with the romantic genre than don\u2019t expect to not see all the usual clich\u00e9 moments such as fireworks at a festival, an open bath/spa spring day out, an amusement park, a graduation and a lot of booze (although with the adults not the kids in question of course). However keep in mind these are the social situations which Japanese children find themselves during their school days (useless anime reference unintended,) and therefore it\u2019s not about blaming the writers for unoriginality, rather we can analyse the method and relative success to which these situations unfold/conclude and Tsuki ga kirei tackles them all with aplomb. Setting aside the random transitions into people being some sort of weird cylindrical beings during initial crowd shots, the excitement seen in the face of Akane as she watches Kotaro perform or even the embarrassment our main characters display after a young girl teases them for kissing, are all important character developmentary scenes which enable us to emotionally connect to the characters on a deeper level. In my view an important aspect for any anime from this genre, especially when our characters undergo various hardships as without this emotional attachment to the characters, we viewers really won\u2019t care what happens to them in the end.\\n\\n\r\nNow Tsuki ga kirei is not a rom-com and therefore comedy Is kept to a minimum, instead substituted for subtle touches of modernity such as googling (or guugling if you will) how to act in a junior high relationship, a young female complaining about weight gain on scales (so true eh!), or even the male athletes making indecent references to the female runners behinds, all situations which we could see occurring at this very moment in time and therefore enhance our ability to relate and connect more with the characters. \\n\\n\r\nFinally in my own humble opinion, the most important part of any anime (in particular romantic animes) is the ending; when an ending is written well the viewers are provided with a sense of closure, and whether that be happiness (such as with Nisekoi) or sadness (Sakurasou) what we all want is for the characters trials and tribulations to be rewarded with something befitting. Now I\u2019m not saying that both of those referenced animes ended well, in fact Sakurasou in my opinion has one of the worst endings of any anime and is in fact a perfect example of what viewers don\u2019t want to see, a character being written off or just sent into the background completely undeservedly for no foreseeable reason other than ending the story (you all know who I mean). Tsuki ga kirei provides us with that closure, with this only being a 12 episode anime the whole prologue from when our main characters finish junior high is shown only as a manga for a few short scenes, however the build up to this is written so well that we can believe and even imagine ourselves as viewers how all these events unfolded and therefore once that \u201cfin\u201d sign appears, we can sit back and reflect on that beautiful journey which dreams are made of.\\n",

The story was sweet and almost nostalgic for me as a young adult watching these middle schoolers in love. I found some of the plot to move slowly, and some montages to be too long. Some of the animation style was very robotic and animated differently than the prominent characters which made them distanced from the people in the background in a weird way. That being said, the careful animation around the festivals and performances were well done. I enjoyed thatthe protags participated in unlikely clubs and that I was able to see/experience a part of their culture I did not know about.  In general, this was a good anime to pass some time and not feel too invested in all while casually cheering on Azumi and Mizuno. Nonetheless I am glad I watched it-young love is always refreshing and Tsuki ga Kirei did it very well.",

It was fun to watch even most of the scene is kind of resemble the real relationship, atleast for me.\r\nThe Story has the same topic as other anime I've watch but with a twist. I even thought they were introverts but as I watch, that opinion was changed. The Story is about two complete strangers, I mean, two students who don't even know each other that start to become close as each episode progress. They are both shy to each other when sorrounded by alot ofpeople, mostly by their friends even they are only the two of them. They are only talkative at the app they call LINE which act as a Messenger app. Even so, as episode progress, they become open to each other and start becoming talkative when they are alone.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art was good. But the white outlines on each character is kind of annoying and become weird because people in the background doesn't. Even so, I gave it a score of 10, why? The white outlines was only annoying and weird in the first and third episode but as you watch, those outlines kind of blend and doesn't bother me anymore. The animation was good aswell. Everything wasn't out of place thanks to putting some animation for the background characters, other anime show kind of make them as some sort of statues not doing anything but make a noise.\\n\\n\r\nThe Music/Sound for this one is good. The music is calm and wasn't plain, its like it makes you feel more when the music sets in mostly on the drama scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters have great personalities and relatable. None of them is out of place. What I mean of out place, were the ones that I don't even seen before like those people with their so called \"Grade 8 syndrome\" , I've seen some on elementary but not on highschool. The Main Characters were unique, well, most shows have MC that the male one is sociable and popular or brave or vise versa, the MC on this show is just like normal people, with different hobbies and life not like those anime with the same formula but it doesn't bother me if the story is good aswell the characters that are relatble and resemble real personalities.\\n\\n\r\nThe Enjoyment, what i can say? It was really fun to watch! Its not like the others that gives you alot of question in the end, this one doesn't make you feel empty after watching it. It doesn't give you the feeling that you want to watch more because it gives you alot of question.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, a score of 10! I recommend it to eveyone! Its have the same topic as other school romance anime but this one gives you a wonderful story. The ending was really unforgettable, but I can't tell because I don't want your experience to be ruined! Go watch it!",

Never before, however, have I fallen in love when watching an anime. Tsuki ga kirei changed that.\r\nThe story behind the show doesn't thrill you like the stories of most highly rated shows. The beauty of Tsuki ga kirei lies in its sheer realisticness. The story revolves around two teens falling in love, and due to the fact the show seems so real, it allows for you to fall in love together with them. The pacing is fairly slow, as expected of a slice of lifeshow, but it was not bothersome when watching the anime nonetheless. \\n\\n\r\nWith Loundraw in the credits, I wasn't suprised when I was met with a some nice eyecandy while watching every episode. \\n\r\nThe opening was a nice bonus, and though the OST isn't very impactful in the show, its simplicity and great placement contributed to making most scenes more heartwarming and compelling. \\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned before, what I like the most about this show is how real it seems. Studio Feel has created some fairly realistic shows in the past, amongst which Oregairu Zoku, I have never seen them do such a great job at presenting a show as if it could have happened in real life. \\n\\n\r\nPutting my own bias aside to rate this show a 10/10, I decided to give it a final vote of 9/10, taking multiple aspects into consideration.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: Watch this anime if you like slice of life or realistic anime, or wish to experience falling in love for the very first time once more. It might not be a show to binge watch, but it is a beautiful anime nonetheless.",

            "content": "These days, the number of anime(s) which focus on relationships among the young, especially teenagers, has been increasing. Behind this phenomenon there is strong effect of \"Tamako Love Story,\" which was once pointed out by the producer of \"Tsuki ga kirei.\"\r\nAnyway, this work is also about love between high-school students. Amazingly, it succeeded to describe teenagers' complicated and delicate emotions.\r\nI had been interested in this anime since it had been revailed, for the director was Seiji Kishi. He is famous for \"Seto no hanayome,\" \"Yuki Yuna wa yusya de aru,\" and so on. In Japan he is recognized as one of the great directors inthis age. Therefore, it is natural that not only I but many anime-funs payed attention to this work.\\n\r\nHowever, while I was really looking forward to it, I could not deny that there was a little anxiety. It is said that it is difficult to depict a school-life as if it really exists in our world, especially a love-romance between a boy and a girl. Also, the director, Kishi, had not created such TV animes yet. So, having worry, I started to watch this series.\\n\\n\r\nFortunately, my worry gradually disappeared as the story went on. Kishi and writers carefully describe many characters with precise background arts, detailed animation (not anime, I mean, the arts of animation,) and some songs.\\n\r\nThe protagonist, Kotaro, had a difficult time: the things wouldn't go on as he wished. He couldn't achieve anything no matter how much effort he made. He sometimes got frastrated, as YOU once experienced.\\n\r\nIn this story, such frustration was delicately depicted with many Japanese novels; maybe the most difficult part to understand for those who aren't familiar with other Japanese cultures. As Kotaro likes to read Japanese literature, he often cites its phrases, especially those of Osamu Dazai. The Japanese understands easily that also the title \"Tsuki ga kirei\" is influenced by Japanese literature. As the title implies, Kotaro's adolescence is decorated with such novels which are now thought as masterpieces. The writers succeeded to describe Kotaro's life as novelists in the Meiji or the Taisho era might write.\\n\r\nSuch atmosphere is strengthened by background arts. Many articles which includes interviews state that the stuff over and over visited Kawagoe, where the story takes on, and made effort to imitate antiquity of its landscape. Thanks to such detailed backgrounds, the story is enveloped by smells of Japanese traditional cultures.\\n\r\nThe stuff, mainly composed of Feel. (an anime studio), also work hard to animate characters. I was surprised by its precise animation. Kotaro smiles slightly, runs hardly, and dances seriously. Of course other characters \"LIVE\" vividly in the world of \"Tsuki ga kirei.\" It is a kind of shock in the industry of TV anime at the time, really.\\n\r\nIt is worth pointing out that some tunes of Nao Toyama also enforces staging of this title. Her warm voice certainly watches over characters' growing-up.\\n\r\nYes, characters grow up through the series. As I mentioned, this title focuses on relationships between boys and girls. They are confronted by many difficulties. The success of \"Tsuki ga kirei\" is that it does not depicts only love affairs but through love it describes many aspects of adolescence: suffering, sadness, agony, and, joy. Going through hard experience, they step by step become adult. You may remind of your younger days and feel sympathy.\\n\\n\r\nIt is difficult to trace the way the young in Japan loves, cries, and lives. However, the stuff of \"Tsuki ga kirei\" made it.\\n\r\nThere are no magic spells in this story, but for certain there is a magic Kishi and Feel. stuff make. It is one of milestones in the 50-year history of Japanese TV anime.",

            "content": "Tsuki ga Kirei is a mess, but it is such in a pleasant and adorable way akin to a puppy that raided the pantry or toddler who colored on the walls.\r\nThe show didn't catch my interest at first glance, and it was not until I heard some excited chatter about it that I decided to give it a chance. Initially I found myself hesitant to buy-in, but after a trial-by-three-episodes I found myself greatly surprised by the quick pacing (compared to most romance shows). There were some episodes in the middle of the series where in I found myself bored and considered dropping the show,but I am glad I did not. While my feelings for the rest of the series are mixed, I am happy to say that the final episode is fantastic.\\n\\n\r\nTsuki ga Kirei gives a look into the relationship of two shy middle-school students and manages to deliver the story in a way that feels much more realistic than most anime concerning romance. Watching the relationships of the series unfold is equal parts enjoyable and cringe-inducing. The awkwardness comes with the territory, I suppose. \\n\\n\r\nThe realism of the show feels nice and consistent. The characters are middle school students, the challenges they face are believable things for middle school students to struggle with, and the drama that builds is of both believable context and intensity for middle school students to experience. \\n\\n\r\nThis is not a plot with high stakes for anyone outside of the focus characters, and I like that about it. These focus characters can generally be identified as 4 or maybe 5 or the cast, but the shows seems keen to fill itself with side characters who are always taking screen timing but never seem to be serving much of a purpose. It may have helped the show a bit to have whittled down this number as having 1-3 characters that contribute some small amount would seem more reasonable than having 10 or so side characters whose contributions are mostly negligible.\\n\\n\r\nPart of me wonders, however, if this same story were delivered in a different medium (other than anime) would there still be comparable excitement about it? As this is an original piece (not based on a manga, light novel, game, etc.) it didn't air with a prior established fan base. Had this been a written or live action piece, I'm not sure the story would have stood out much. As an anime it feels unique in a mundane yet delightful sort of way when put next to the fantastical and hyper-exaggerated, but if the story were critiqued outside of the context of anime I am not sure there is anything overly special about it.\\n\\n\r\nAs an anime, the show struggles in the visual department. The art is passable most of the time, but there are moments of severe quality drop. The show's visual style is nothing special, but there is also an underlying sloppiness that was likely the product of rushing to meet a deadline, too low or a poorly planned budget, or the artists trying to do too much and it backfiring.\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend watching Tsuki ga Kirei for those who are fans of genre, but there is no wow factor to hold the attention of those who are not. It is an enjoyable ride even if there are some technical bumps in the road and moments of cringe. Having watched the show after overhearing some hype, I would discourage anyone from buying into it. This is a simple and enjoyable story with a rough execution at times.",

            "content": "Love is not as simple as you think, at least in the real world. Sometimes when watching anime, at least for me, you get tired of all the cliches in romance anime. You know, nosebleeds or crude jokes or some kind of love triangle that may not improve the story. For me, I was waiting to watch a romance anime that didn't go to that extreme and was a \"slice of life\" type romance anime. Tsuki ga Kirei is exactly that, a 12 episode romance anime that is more realistic than most. The awkwardness and silence make for a very realistic anime.\r\nStory- I can't spoilit, huh? I wouldn't want to either, and you'll get a grasp of the story in the first episode!! A brief review of the 12 episodes would go like this. Two 3rd years in middle school are now in the same class. They both spot each other. Their shyness gets in the way of them being able to hold a conversation. One day, after a event the boy and the girl notice each other through different moments. Over the course of the anime, their shyness at talking to each other reduces bit by bit. Of course Feel. uses LINE to allow the characters to communicate between each other. By the end of the story, both characters are sure about their future between each other. Does the challenges of preparing to go to High School get in between them or does it strengthen their relationship, You gotta watch to see!! The story is smooth and nothing feels pushed, nothing too overdramatic. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nArt- Come on, it's 2017 and anime is getting better and better each year. Kirei takes animation to another level IMO. Not only are the movements of the characters good but the detail in each shot, it is as if you are in Kawagoe, you can even check out the similarities in shots between the real city and the representation in the anime. I would even go to the extreme to say that almost every shot in the anime is not boring. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound- Well, it's hard to say how great the music is as it is not used that often. Kirei uses music rarely compared to other romance anime. You may be thinking that, \"oh the scenes aren't going to be full of substance\". You would be right in other anime series but in Kirei it is the opposite, the lack of music adds to the intensity in scenes and allows you focus and put your feelings into the scene. Your feeling are not dictated by the music but by the actions in the scene. With that out of the way, the opening theme and the ending theme are magnificent!! I listen to both on a anime playlist!! 10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- There are two main characters and two \"in the way\" characters. The two main are Kotaro Azumi and Akane Mizuno. The anime does a great job at giving each hobbies and things to do in their lives such as preparing for sports, Mizuno, and preparing for a festival, Azumi. The characters talk just enough and sometimes not enough, which adds to the scenes. They aren't over the top or loud, they are quite shy. The shyness allows you as the watcher to connect to their feelings as if they were your own. The two \"in the way\" characters are also very well designed in their attitudes. They don't feel like the characters that always get in the way, they add to the story and give the building relationship between Azumi and Mizuno a challenge. Overall each character is beautifully designed and each have very good, well thought out personalities. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- I wouldn't be writing this review if I didn't absolutely love this anime!! For 12 episodes, it felt like I spent my time wisely watching this anime. I love the opening theme, I love the shyness and awkwardness between the two characters and I love how realistic the relationship is for 3rd year students in middle school. I love the scenes not only between the main characters but the detail in those and other scenes. You could spend dozens of minutes on one episode looking at all the detail, a masterpiece made by Feel. 10/10 \\n\\n\r\nOverall- Every aspect of this anime is great. Of course, you, the viewer, have to want to what a realistic school romance anime. If you are looking for that, then the 12 episodes of Tsuki ga Kirei will grant you that wish. Not to mention that at the end of many episodes there are funny shorts about characters around the two main ones. You feel satisfied after watching both the episode and a minute or two of shorts. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading this, I really appreciate it as it took me a while to think of how to write my true feelings about the show down. I hope you enjoy this anime if you do watch it and if you don't watch it, I hope you find other anime that fills your heart with joy!! Have a great day!! \\n",

            "content": "SUMMARY\r\nThis is a wonderful show.  It's wholesome, sweet, romantic, realistic, and overall a kind of surprising show coming from the anime industry today.  There's no fanservice, no characters that are little more than tropes or cliches, and no formulaic plot.  It avoids all of those pitfalls of anime and manages to combine great elements of drama, romance, and slice-of-life and packages them into a very rewarding 12 episode length show.\r\nDETAILS\r\nStory - 10\r\nThis is the selling point of this show.  It's a romance about two middle school students in Japan.  It's their first relationship for the both of them.  Theyare young and inexperienced; they are maybe a bit naive and embarrassed with the whole situation, but they also learn to really care about each other and are willing to work through the difficulties of being in a relationship.  I found it to be surprisingly relatable despite the characters' very young age.  It's a show you can probably learn something from.  And I like that it's a good-natured, wholesome show, and that it's not cynical.  It succeeds in its realism.  If you think about the fact that the characters are basically plain and realistic people and that the setting is as mundane as possible, then you can really appreciate how the writing and directing for this show are so phenomenal.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8\\n\\n\r\nThis show won't wow you with its art or animation, but it doesn't need to and it's not trying to.  It looks slightly low-budget for anime in 2017.  There's nothing unappealing about the art, and I think the characters do look cute.  Actually, I think the show hits a sweet-spot and uses its resources well.  The somewhat plain presentation is appropriate for the nature of the show.  It complements the characters and the setting well.  This is why I score this category as high as 8.  But you also can't really give a 9 or 10 to a show that looks like this, no matter how appropriate the visuals might be.  Don't let the art or animation stop you from watching this show.  It does exactly what it needs to do to present the story.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8\\n\\n\r\nBasically the same level of quality as the art and animation.  The character voice acting is good and, again, exactly what it needs to be for this show.  It's not going to wow you or anything, so it's not like it can earn a 9 or 10.  But it's probably the perfect level of performance for this show.  I thought that the acting for the female lead was particularly good in the last few episodes during the more dramatic moments.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10\\n\\n\r\nSame as the story category.  The characters are so great because of the writing and directing.  Each of the male and female leads are likable and you want their relationship to succeed.  Other side characters involved in love-triangles are also well realized.  The heartbreak some of the characters eventually feel has weight due to the character development and the depiction of the relationships.  The things the characters try in order to either win someone over or to protect their relationship all feel like things kids might do or try.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9\\n\\n\r\nObviously, kind of subjective.  The reason I don't give it a 10 is because the first episode was kind of slow, and I honestly thought about dropping the show at first.  But I decided to give a few more episodes a shot, and I'm glad I did.  Once the ball gets rolling and the relationship between the lead starts, the show really settles in.  So overall the show is a slow-starter, but becomes engaging and earns your attention later on.  The show will take you on a roller coaster of emotions, along the ups and downs with the characters.  If that's not what you're looking for out of drama and romance, then I don't know what to tell you.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10\\n\\n\r\nEverything about this show from the writing, characters, art, animation, sound, etc., seems to come together perfectly in the presentation of the story.  In that sense, it's harmonious, and in that sense I can't find very many faults with the show.  It did exactly what it needed to do in order to be a wholesome, good-natured, and realistic romance between very young people.  If that's the kind of show you're hoping to find, then what are you waiting for?  Watch this show.",

            "content": "To be honest,  I picked this up due the attractive artwork caught my attention and the title itself, tsuki ga kirei. I was not disappointed.\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nAs a fan of slice of life shows like non non biyori, natsume yuujinchou, Flying witch, K-on, Is your order a rabbit? , yama no susume, Anohana, Your life in april and many others, this show started slow and relaxing like any other slice of life anime, not giving away any eye catching moments like other genres. I basically like how it started off. The story slowly develops, and I have to say, is the most natural, most realisticand the most beautiful romance story out of all I have watched thus far. \\n\\n\r\nIt is a story about how a group of high school students go through their days, those who fell in love, those with unrequited love. But, the important thing is that all these happened naturally, not with alot of drama even for scenes unrequited love which we often encounter in anime with the girls boldly trying to snatch the guy despite the obvious love the guy shows for one of the particular girls e.g. Nisekoi. This anime beautifully captures the meaning of tsuki ga kirei (I love you) and emphasises on the quiet first-times the girl and the boy share with each other. The pace was pretty fine as well, I don't find the ending rushed and I'm more than happy that the ending song at the last episode shows a brief after story and a proper consistent ending the anime deserves. I'm also glad that they know when to stop instead of making it crazy long to milk the series and bore us.\\n\\n\r\nThe only complaint I have is the amount of screen time for \"Lime\" or Line chatting app. I have no idea if Line takes part in all the slice of life gems or something but I usually find that app in these gems in my case. Others include relife. While I found it used too often is this series but is not a bad thing as it does contribute to the relationship development between the introvert couple... although I would have preferred a bit more face to face times for them. That aside, I have no qualms about the story.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\r\nThe characters are pretty likable. You don't find a single character you would want to suddenly call a \"bitch\" in the middle of the anime, neither do you find any irritating characters around the MCs.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 8/10\\n\r\nI'd say, it is relaxing, I can't say it got one of the best OSTs out there but it matches the story just fine. I pretty much like how relaxing it is just like the story.\\n\\n\r\nArt:10/10\\n\r\nThe important thing I look for in an anime is consistent art (wouldn't want wobbling art like naruto shippuden in the pain arc), and I have no problems with it here. The art used here is one of a kind and it really very pretty. This utilization  is very appealing to me in this slice of life romance.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the story as one of the best slice of life romance out there. The story is depicted realistically and naturally, about a quiet romance that might be occurring in corners of the world that we may never know. At least that is the feeling I get with this series, thus giving it 10/10",

            "content": "Tsuki ga Kirei is an anime that is constantly trying desperately to be more than the sum of its parts. It coasts through every school romance cliche with a melancholy mood that could be an absolute masterpiece if I could muster up a shred of care for the main couple. \r\nThe two main characters are, to put it mildly, dull. Their interests are explored only at a shallow level and their conversations constantly feel like small talk. They lack any sort of chemistry and I'm constantly left feeling like they're in love with being in love rather than actually in love with each other. Atthe end of each episode, several shorts about the rest of the cast play, and I find myself wishing I could spend more time with them and less with the protagonists. \\n\\n\r\nThe result is an anime that I can't understand the hype over. To me, Tsuki ga Kirei feels like it's constantly coasting by on as little effort to the writing as possible, borrowing elements from other series that are more enjoyable than it. It feels less like a full-fledged series and more like a template for a potential one.",

It lacks any real substance . A major part of the series is pretty everyday like which is boring and also one of the reasons the show is compelling . The 2 main characters are given everything to work with . The supporting cast don't do much but they have a strong purpose and set up the philosophical aspectsof the show nicely . The animation is pretty nice and the best thing about the show is probably the use of music . Every music used is a good fit for the running scene . The storytelling is so simple and yet so subtle . The quote references are very relatable and answer certain questions for you . The use of psychology was also something to behold .Adolescence was portrayed fairly well as well . The script was quite good and skipped the unnecessary generic lines which worked to sell the characters . However the direction in this series is where it deserves its main praise . Doing everything it can to sell the main characters and their awkward feelings . The supporting characters don't do much . But in reality their script plays a valuable role in telling us how middle schoolers have started to think and how their change in mentality affects one another . Tsuki ga kirei doesn't offer much when it comes to the thrills . Its rather about the artistic way everything was brought up . It can potentially change you as a person due to the subtle philosophical outlook that was presented in the show .\\n\r\nWait wait wait I said it lacks substance . So why is this good ? I believe the message told here is the reality . Life doesn't have the substance we expect it to have . During Adolescence we have this strong desire to grow up fast . Not everything we do makes sense and thats how it is . But our feelings are something we can't change at will . Sometimes our curiosity leads us to experiment with our life and most of the time it hurts . But you do that because you look for something new , something strong enough to change you as a person . The answer to that in the show is 'love' . They use it to showcase the characters and their changes . The show tests the characters with different teenage obstacles and gives us a solution / better picture of a lot of things . The emotional side is strong and does its job although that is debatable . This is no fairy tale . Things are as close as it is in real life . The ending can be interpreted as a moral lesson as well . (no spoilers ) \\n\r\nIn short the series not only manages to capture the casual audience with a touching story , its philosophical representation and reality based writing is good enough to change your view / have a better concept on certain things . Then again art is so subjective and a writers way of presentation may not impress everyone . But when a show can do all those mentioned above you know it manages to do its job .",

            "content": "Romance stories usually deal with the love between two people. Even when more than two people are involved in love triangles and such, most of the time the story is about which pairing will end up being the pairing. Aside from this kind of love, however, we sometimes lose sight of the other people who love us in life. Family, friends. Of course, when we get into this area, we have crossed genres entirely.\r\nTsukigakirei is about the love between two people. And in a sense, these two people will be the main focus of the story throughout. However, the usual way this focus is appliedin many romance anime, nowadays, seems to be to focus just on these people who are involved in the actual romance, and maybe one or two support characters who only get to be there because they will have a direct effect on the romance. Any tension or drama that is generated will arise from misunderstandings (which over repeated usage at best make the characters seem a bunch of idiots, and at worst leads the audience to start questioning the skills of the writer), love rivalry, or just poor luck or bad situations.\\n\\n\r\nThere is more to our lives than our boy/girlfriends, however. Even as a middle school student, you have a social circle, your own hobbies, ambitions, obligations (and as a side note, activities could fit into several of these categories), and of course, your family, who try to keep your best interests at heart, but that sometimes means they push you into making a particular choice, and sometimes means they will disagree with your (in hindsight, perhaps a bad) decision. Maybe this kind of drama is not as exciting, but in Tsukigakirei, it resonates.\\n\\n\r\nWhile watching this, I enjoyed watching two people play the game of romance. It is for this purpose that we enjoy romance stories, after all. But equally, I enjoyed watching two people try to get through middle school life, with all its various obligations, at the same time. I will note that I say \"people\" here, not \"characters\", because at some point, I became heavily invested in these two, for a variety of reasons, though I believe the largest of which is that I got to see their circle of friends, and their supporting families. These are the people who we also love, though perhaps in a different way, and I could see that they were as important to each other as the people I care about in my own life.\\n\\n\r\nOne final thing. Tsukigakirei has, as far as I can recall, no internal monologue. We never know what any of the people are thinking other than what we see displayed on their faces, or what they say out loud. Because complex misunderstandings leading to fights between couples is not what this story is about. And because the writer and the animators are skilled enough that they can show us information about what these people are going through, without having the character explicitly spell it out for us.\\n\\n\r\nThe moon is beautiful, isn't it?",

            "content": "I should preface this by saying that Tsuki ga Kirei is far from a perfect anime. While the background art is gorgeous, the characters themselves are often very inconsistently drawn and the background characters are almost always CG'd very badly and distractingly. And while the characters are lovable and relatable, the grunting noises that the main boy Kotarou makes when he's frustrated (in the Japanese dub at least) are really annoying to me. But despite these things and a few other small details, I still consider Tsuki ga Kirei to be a masterpiece in storytelling and likely my personal favorite anime of the 400+ I'veseen.\\n\\n\r\nIn its 12 episodes, this show focuses on one main thing: the relationship between protagonists Kotarou Azumi and Akane Mizuno. Any other drama that occurs in the show itself is somehow tangentially related to their relationship, and anything else is left to the cute shorts after the ED. By focusing exclusively on one thing, it gives the relationship the time it needs to flesh out before the viewer. And it definitely takes its time at some parts. Some parts of the show are almost agonizingly awkward with Kotarou and Akane just sitting, unsure of what to do next and not wanting to make a wrong move. But as awkward as these scenes are, I think they very appropriately capture an important part of their relationship, and reflect the two characters' personalities as well.\\n\\n\r\nOther small details in the show like Akane's potato sack that she plays with the ease her anxiety and Kotarou's boxing with his lamp pull-string add depth to the characters and give us a bit of insight into the quirky middle schoolers that they are. And these details are very welcome in a show where a decent amount of the characters' interactions happen over text message (LINE specifically), with no accompanying dialogue. I've heard people complain about the obnoxious LINE product placement, but I think the show is just being realistic. That's what Japanese kids use these days! Their social interactions occur over LINE, and in conversation that talk about it as such.\\n\\n\r\nWhen the characters are being quiet, though, the backing music is fantastic. It's usually quiet and unassuming, much like the characters themselves, and it perfectly captures the moods in the show. The OP and ED are equally fantastic, with the ED in particular giving me butterflies after every episode because of how cute it sounds after something good happening in the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Tsuki ga Kirei is a beautiful show. The characters feel real and relatable, and they both have lives outside of the relationship, with Kotarou being an aspiring writer and participant in a local festival's parade, and with Akane being a track star. They don't need each other, and if not for them just being put in the same class, they may never have started dating. But the series shows the viewers how they happened to come together and why they're attracted to each other. Watching them grow as a couple and as individuals is a pleasure to watch, and I would recommend it to anyone that likes a good romance show.",

            "content": "Warning possible Spoilers\r\nI may have finally found the gem of the spring 2017 anime's because despite having a very simple story that is all it needed really and it had great characters to back it up.\r\nThe story is about Kotarou Azumi an aspiring writer and Akane Mizuno a track team member who end up in the same class, they start out as complete strangers until after a few occurrences where they slowly develop feelings for each other until Azumi ask's one question that would change their lives.\r\nNow what I really like about the story is how simple it is it doesn't use complex story elementsto get to the next point and instead it just use's the characters interactions and the situations they encounter to keep the plot moving and it does this in a really good way, it also does what usually my favourite romances do is have the main characters ending up together before the series has finished so you get to see how Kotarou's and Akane's relationship develops and the development of their relationship is the best thing about the show as it starts out it very little interaction and most of the time they communicate by texting though as time goes by they become more comfortable with each other and start talking more than they do texting, their relationship does go through a few bumps and turns too since there are other people who have affection for these characters, but luckily these situations were handled very well and in a surprisingly mature way in fact this whole show was actually very mature compared to many other anime's that do romance.\\n\r\nWhat I also liked about this show is that at the end of most episodes there were these short episodes that give you short snippets of the other characters in the show and how their relationships went as the main characters weren't the only ones in a relationship.\\n\\n\r\nThere isn't really much to say about the characters other than the main two because the show pretty much focuses on them, but the supporting characters do have their moments.\\n\r\nKotarou and Akane are the main characters of the anime and they are very similar characters who do different things, their personalities are mostly the same as they both act shy and awkward around people they aren't familiar with, but are much more open once they get to know each other and their friends, they both care about their friends too often helping them out to the best of their abilities and they are also very mature too which was a bit of a surprise as the situations they got caught up in they actually handled them very well.\\n\r\nNishio Chinatsu and Takumi Hira are the two characters who have crushes on the main characters, Nishio is Akane's best friend and develops a crush on Kotarou as he got on very well with her, she is actually a kind and thoughtful girl as she even supports Akane's relationship even though she has a crush on Kotarou and Takumi is the track team leader who has a crush on Akane, he is a reliable and attentive person who takes good care of his team, both of these characters do accept the fact that Kotarou and Akane are in a relationship the only time they interrupt the relationship is so they can tell the characters how they feel so they can get it off their chest instead of continuing to pursue them which nicely made the love triangles short lived.\\n\r\nKotarou and Akane both have their group of friends who pretty much act like any normal junior high schooler as they are always a source of comedy for the show and often tease the man characters, but they can be a bit nosy in their business as they find Akane and Kotarou's relationship interesting since all of their relationships are a pain to deal with in some way.\\n\r\nYou also have the main characters family to deal with too who are mainly concerned about their education especially Kotarou's family who are much more strict than Akane's, though not a major part of the story until near the end they do show that being a parent isn't an easy job.\\n\\n\r\nNow the artstyle is different compared to other anime's that I've seen and one thing that sticks out is the white shine on the side of people's face's that did seem oddly distracting sometime's luckily I did get used to it, there is also quite an abundance of CGI here especially with people walking in the background which did ruin some of the scenery, however there are scene's like the festival's that Akane and Kotarou went to that looked really amazing.\\n\r\nI thought the soundtrack was pretty good too it really helped out with the sentimental scene's that Akane and Kotarou had which made the scene's have a little more emotional impact.\\n\\n\r\nNow the Romance was very well done as you really see the development between Akane and Kotarou who start out as awkwardly stuttering people to very well communicative and caring couple and seeing their journey was brilliant, they had great chemistry and were friggin adorable especially during the sentimental scene's and when their relationship encountered a problem they dealt with it in a very mature fashion and faced the problem straight away instead of leaving it to make things worse which nicely got rid of some cliche's I have seen in other romance's.\\n\r\nThere was also the Love triangle's too which seemed like the only thing appropriate as a situation in this romance, but it was handled properly and the characters who liked the MC's weren't dislikeable either and gave up once they knew the Akane and Kotarou were together well aside from them confessing, but that was more for closure really.\\n\\n\r\nEven though it doesn't say it in the genre tags there is some comedy in this anime mainly from the short episodes at the end which mainly showed the other characters relationship's and they were really funny to see even if it was for only a few seconds and pretty much showed that relationships are never easy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this was a very good and simple romance that is definitely going to be a memorable one from this year so if you're looking for a sweet and simple romance then this is definitely a good choice.",

            "content": "Tsuki ga Kirei is an anime I watched on a friends recommendation. In my opinion, it is best described as a coming of age story about finding oneself, young love, and the stresses of transitioning from a child to a teen and gaining responsibilities. \r\nThe story focuses around 2 MCs, both in their 3rd year of middle school. The boy is a passionate writer, while the girl an aspiring track athlete. Both characters express desires to improve their craft, but also to be accepted by their peers. When the two children finally become aware of each other is where the story truly begins. They slowlybuild a bond throughout the show, and once they begin dating you learn of all the struggles of maintaining contact, growing together, and dealing with the judgment of those around them. \\n\\n\r\nIn order to stray away from spoilers, I will simply give a rundown of my interpretation of the show:\\n\\n\r\nThe shows greatest strength is its characters, each character feels like an actual  middle schooler. they fit real tropes, from social statuses to hobbies, and all have their own unique mannerisms. They have a genuine feel such as \"the young awkward phase\" or the \"submissive child\" which allows you to really get engrossed in their lives. Though the show is slow, you feel as though your watching real life events. The kids do what kids do, they hang out, they go to school, its as you'd expect of children their age. \\n\\n\r\nMy largest qualm with the show is the use of CG to reduce time spend designing irrelevant people for the background which at times was stiff or distracting, and the pacing at times was almost too slow, these both are clearly personal dissatisfaction. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I feel this show sits at around a 7.8 on my scale, in the good-very good stage. The show may have been slow, but you felt connected. You wanted to see what would happen, and the cast is truly precious, if not memorable. Each character model was  quite nice and The plot (while slow moving) was delivered cleanly, with little to no physical hiccups to the characters or the stories progression. This show was a gentle, sweet experience. \\n\\n\r\nMy recommendation is if you like romance, cute kids, and relatable authentic characters this may be for you. in the end you're left with a nice bittersweet feeling, and thats something I've always felt was a sign of a well made show. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading, best of luck in your Anime endevors!",

            "content": "The art is... interesting. I'm not exactly a fan of it, but I'll give it a few points for being different, at least. I didn't really notice the sound, which means that it did its job. If I remember the music, it's either because it was outstanding or horrid.\r\nThe story is the relationship between a boy and a girl. There's nothing really special about the story, which is to be expected of a slice-of-life-ish middle school romance anime. It takes a long time for the pace to pick up as well. The plot is fairly predictable, but what happens is pretty heartfelt and sweet, soI feel that it was pulled off well. If you're going to go cliche, then do it well at least.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are decent, at best. They have their own quirks, but there weren't really any stand-out personalities. Note to authors: giving each character one or two funny or unique quirks or traits doesn't make them good characters. Like... \"Oh, she squeezes her dolly thingy when she's nervous! What a unique character!\" Haha. No. Other characters, who seem like they might play a pivotal role in the story, are just inserted to cause a bit of trivial drama and then fade into the background again. If you're expecting some big drama or plot twists or whatever... let's just say that it's as likely to happen as it does in real life (which could be seen as a good thing if you like realism).\\n\\n\r\nYeah, although the anime is fairly average, I'm a sucker for romance and PogChamp whenever I see something cute or lovey-dovey. That's where my enjoyment scoring of 9 comes in. For every predictable eye-roll moment that happens, there's a sweet romantic eye-roll inducing moment that put a stupid smile on my face. I felt embarrassed for the characters, I felt sad for them, and I felt happy for them. I'm not sure if Tsuki ga Kirei leaves us viewers with a particularly wise message, but I guess it could happen.\\n\\n\r\nA run-of-the-mill romantic anime that caters to my love of adorableness and the raw adolescent \"love will find a way\" mentality leaves Tsuki ga Kirei with a score of 8.\\n\\n",

            "content": "(Minor Spoilers Ahead)\r\nTsuki Ga Kirei is a heartwarming tale of how far a pure first love romance can go. Starting it in middle school with protagonists that are so young and pure it\u2019s hard not to smile with childlike glee when you see them do things for the first time. In fact it\u2019s ironic that these 2 middle schoolers manage to do more than an entire decade of To Love Ru has accomplished.\r\nPlot/Character Development 9/10\r\nNone, and I mean none of this what was that I can\u2019t hear you nonsense with a confession, no endless circles or beating around the bush, it\u2019s straight and to thepoint and I like that. Nowadays romance animes seem to try and milk as much screentime as possible out of the show, (mainly due to the majority of them being Light Novel adaptations after all), it\u2019s refreshing to see the pace of how this show was planned out. The main events happen early on to kick start the relationship off yet it manages to not feel forced or rushed at all. It actually seems genuinely believable how this relationship started. You see how they start it off as being awkward to each other and nervous to even talk to another since it\u2019s their first time to becoming more and more accustomed to one another as time goes on in a natural progression that you can actually see happening in a real life situation. Sufficient character development is made with the main characters and they even manage to fit side character development in the span of 12 episodes as well. You can see the tension and anxiety they experience from making choices that could potentially be irreversible and destroy friendships with ones they hold dear with.\\n\\n\r\nMusic 10/10\\n\r\nExcellent and I mean damn excellent. The Opening and Ending themes deserve standing ovations on their own but the music in between episodes is absolutely outstanding as well. The music picks are absolutely perfect and actually add a layer of depth to the scene being watched unlike many shows nowadays who add music to a scene to fill the awkward silence or to hide the awkwardness of how some of the lines sound.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation 7/10\\n\r\nThis is where it gets a bit murky, and you can tell they were definitely trying to cut costs with this one. The art on the main characters and side characters themselves are great, the style itself reminds me of a beautiful rendition of a water coloring drawing and is fantastic on the eyes, at least in my opinion. But dear God the usage of CGI was apparent and often, I\u2019d say on the level of Berserk 2016 bad. You\u2019ll notice within the first 2 minutes of watching the show these stick figures walking they attempted to mold into a human being right next to actual animated characters and that contrast completely breaks immersion while watching the show. If the usage wasn\u2019t that often, I wouldn\u2019t have minded or docked off that much but it is painfully apparent the scope of what they were trying to portray would not fit into the budget they wanted and tried to make due with CGI which was a bad decision in my opinion. The background characters made by CGI look like Kokeshi dolls and I\u2019m not pulling your leg. \\n\\n\r\nWrap Up\\n\r\nTsuki Ga Kirei is an excellent short foray into the romance genre that gets where it needs to be in the span of 12 episodes. There are no loose ends, and you feel fulfilled by the end when you\u2019ve finished it (at least I did binging the thing till 6 AM). Character development is done well despite the episode limits you have unlike certain other romance shows *cough cough Nisekoi*. The Music is an award winner in my book and the art can hold it\u2019s own for the most part if you don\u2019t count the awful large usage of CGI. Is it worth a watch? Yes, every minute of your time spent watching this won\u2019t feel wasted and you\u2019ll end coming out of it feeling truly content with everything wrapped up nicely with a bow tie.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score 9/10\\n\\n",

I'm a bit of a sucker for romance but i feel this show is great for those whom haven't watched a great deal of romance anime. The story for me was relatable which brought it closer to home so to say and i feel itwill be for many others.\\n\\n\r\nThe art for the show is not the cleanest that I have seen but is still pleasing to watch. The backgrounds are however some of the best i have seen. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is good in both dub and sub, I watched the show in dub as I find myself reading the subtitles more then watching the show. I did watch one episode in sub and the sound was fine. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are amazing. I found myself wishing that one of the main characters was real as i found him very relatable. If you're looking for an anime that has interesting character this is one for you. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I thoroughly enjoyed this show and would strongly recommend you watch it.  The ending is one of the best ways i have ever seen an anime end and that alone is a great reason to watch the show.",

            "content": "I believe anime achieves greatness by being true to itself. Tsuki ga Kirei does that with flying colors by taking the School Life Romance genre template and creating a real story out of that. To avoid any major spoilers, I'll compare it to the movie \"Get Out\" by Jordan Peele. I know what you're thinking: \"whoa, that's a horror movie and this is a school life romance. what could they have in common?\" I'll tell you. It is characters who are WOKE. Jordan Peele talks a lot in his interviews about how he wanted to make a MC that you could relate to and wouldn'tdo the dumb horror tropes like walking towards dangerous sounds or being a victim. In the same way, the characters of Tsuki ga Kirei are not oblivious. In many lesser anime of the genre, they will build up character development only to negate it all with something stupid and then put you right back at square one. Tsuki ga Kirei doesn't beat around the bush and provides a realistic and meaningful story of to shy kids trying to find their way.",

            "content": "Tsuki ga Kirei emerges as a soft and refreshing return from recent anime\u2019s of its category. Like new camera models incorporating older designs, Tsuki ga Kirei goes back to basics, focusing on the innocent, nostalgic, and far less melodramatic relationships of old that we recall in our own lives. Free of the hum drum of mainstream anime and its recent ubiquity, the story unfolds honestly, consistently, and with light and subtle flourishes. The combination of these features and the absence of ridiculous progressions (or hindering) in the story and characters allows for an experience that is far more satisfying, in-depth, and true to nature thanthe quick hit, quick elation, anime\u2019s of the same genre.\\n\\n\r\nLooking at it from a much more critical perspective of its work, the art and music flow well with the storyline that the anime endeavours to pedal. A softer approach to art and its muted colour palette, produces a visual aspect that is consistent (something lacking to anime as of late) to the story yet pleasing to the viewer. In regards to the soundtrack (which have always been of heavy interest to me), Tsuki ga Kirei plays the melody of the march it weaves particularly well. It does well in matching elations in sound and in story or contributing curiousity, the spirit of youth, and sheer beauty of life in the peals of its piano strikes, its long and short draws of string, its ambient sound, and/or its use of deafening silence (see wind chime tunnel scene, 14m13s, in Episode 8).\\n\\n\r\nTsuki ga Kirei is a welcome departure from the status quo but at the same time, its stripped-down view of a pure relationship and the simple and even, nostalgic, story and storytelling warrants a warm and hearty: okaerinasai.",

What do you do when you are, or the one you love is, being crushed on by someone else? How do you overcome shyness, barriers and confusion to form a definite and unbreakable love? How do you succeed in your passions, while also succeeding in a relationship with your lover?\r\nTsuki ga Kirei answers it all.\r\nHonestly, this was probably the most beautiful, heartwarming, feels-inducing anime series I've seen so far. I love the two main characters - Akane and Azumi are both so lovable and realistic!Their shyness, introverted natures and preference to chat over LINE rather than face-to-face is so relatable and lifelike. The storyline and how it is portrayed is amazing and gripping, too. I genuinely felt so tense at parts, and so overjoyed at parts, that I actually screamed out loud. There were times when I was literally cheering out loud, encouraging the charcters, shouting \"NO!\", and squealing in delight. (My mum must think I'm crazy, lol) ^ O ^\\n\r\nThe art was beautiful; the sakura, the festival lights, even the everyday images of the school was absolutely stunning. I love how the characters look like real people - no huge eyes, overexaggerated faces, crazy hair, unrealistically skinny bodies or sexualised characters. Everyone looked HUMAN, and that makes me so happy!! I'm also suuuuper glad there were no scenes that would be inappropriate for children, except the odd cuss word and one of the animated shorts containing a sexualised image of a woman in a magazine. I feel uncomfortable watching gory or sexual scenes, so I'm glad there was none of that at all! The music made me want to cry at times, and the voice acting was perfect! The intro and outro made me want to sing along with all my heart. And reading the cute line messages was really interesting... they all make sense in the end...\\n\r\nAlso, the animated shorts at the end of most episodes made me giggle like a  child > o < \\n\r\nOverall, I think this is truly a gem of an anime which everyone should watch. I finished it in 3 days, which is a record for me - I COULDN'T STOP WATCHING IT! If you're into slice-of-life, school, romance, or even sports, you will probably enjoy it!\\n\r\n^ w ^",

            "content": "TSUKI GA KIREI\r\nTsuki ga kirei is an innocent romantic anime, it doesn't quite hit the mark at times but doesn't fail at any particular things either\r\nPROS\r\nTsuki ga kirei has some very engaging episodes. Unlike many other engaging anime's, it doesn't draw you in with over the top drama but with its own innocent charm. The first few episodes are the best in my opinion, I couldn't stop watching. The art style was something that grew on me. At the start I didn't quite know what to think, however it really did grow on me as it's quite refreshing to see a different art style fromthe usual anime's.\\n\\n\r\nCONS\\n\r\nIf you are looking for a seriously romantic and dramatic anime like 'Golden Time', then this wont really satisfy what you're looking for. It's character development is lack-luster, even within the main characters. It doesn't have a real punch to any of its intense moments and I feel it under-uses the effects music can have on a scene.\\n\\n\r\nShould you watch?\\n\r\nHonestly, Tsuki ga kireri is a hard one because its bang smack in the middle of an intense romantic anime and a light bubbly one. I think it's something quite enjoyable if you aren't looking to laugh or cry, you are looking for something that'll excite your childhood, I'll be it a little bland though. I've learn't from Tsuki, that just because somethings is bland doesn't mean it's bad.",

            "content": "(COMPLETELY AMATEUR BUT SPOILER FREE REVIEW) \r\n   Okay, here goes. This will be my first review of an anime. This anime is an outstanding art that i've probably wanted to watch since i was still a first grade anime watcher. The romance of this anime isn't that overflowing as the other animes i've watched it's just... right. I'm known as someone that's really not that good at transversing words, but trust me on this one, it's as \"right\" as you think. The development of this anime is perfectly made even though i got a little bit surprised because of it's kind of quickdecisions, but whatever it is the anime's story will still live up to the expectations of the viewers.\\n\\n\r\n   I don't really have anything to say to the artstyle to this anime, it's as my uncreative mode would say \"great\" i guess, i don't have any experience to comment to the artstyle because i'm still pretty new to the anime community, but i can't really say any anime's artstyle as bad because i enjoyed all of them, yes ALL of them (even kanon's 2002 version's artsyle). The music of this anime is perfect, i can say, as it embodies the correct moment in the right time. And i loved both the opening and ending.\\n\\n\r\n   As full, i'll definitely hear the opening over and over again for the next 1 month and i'll definitely will not forget the ending. i enjoyed this anime and i know you'll too :) and that's my short review thanks for reading and i hope i'll get better at this reviewing thing. \\n\\n\r\n9/10 will definitely recommend\\n\\n\r\n(i don't really talk english in my everyday life, so sorry if there's any wrong grammar in this review)",

            "content": "Light spoilers below. Studio Feel will make you feel.\r\nDespite that Tsuki ga Kirei originally seemed destined for obscurity, its rating's recent ascension to an 8.3+ speaks volumes about Studio Feel's ability to enthrall viewers in a fairly simple story about young love.  Put simply, Tsuki ga Kirei is one of those hidden gems whose first few episodes belie its true potential and excellence.  I hope you will decide to give it a chance.\r\nDespite its slow start, Tsuki ga Kirei flourishes alongside our two main protagonists, Akane and Koutarou, as they progress through the familiar struggles of junior high school: exams, clubs, friendships, anddifficult new experiences. Although they are not the most expressive pair, we learn about them through their decisions and conversations as they discover each other.  \\n\\n\r\nDue to their distinct hobbies, personalities, and friend groups, both Akane and Koutarou exist beyond their mutual relationship- allowing the audience to grow closer to each individual while simultaneously investing in them as a couple.  The characters, in general, are actually one of the show's strongest points because they are realistic and believable.  The common romance tropes are left behind completely; there are no accidental boob grabs or simple misunderstandings which balloon to nuclear heights. The characters have problems and they talk to one another. This unique aspect propelled this show from good to great in my eyes because it made the drama more than just believable, it made the drama relatable.  We root for the characters because we see ourselves in them and recognize their mistakes and struggles as our own. We empathize with them even as we bang our heads against the wall because we know that it is truly impossible to have your shit together at the age of 15.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the plot is realistic and developed. To my surprise, I found that little was left unaddressed or wanting by the end. Perhaps my greatest regret is that the show ended so conclusively that hopes for a second season or continuation are inconceivable.  \\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nAlthough I do not believe that the art was the apex of Tsuki ga Kirei's excellence, I found the character designs to be appealing and distinguishable.  Be warned, there is occasionally some unfortunate use of cgi to accentuate the backgrounds, but what I once considered an annoyance and an eye-sore quickly was overshadowed by crisp, colorful, and beautiful backgrounds and environments.  As the show progressed, my opinion of the art dramatically increased from just okay to often impressive.  \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for this anime was on point. Both the OP and ED matched the tone and theme of the show and encapsulated the intimate feel that the story espouses. The OST was also rather extraordinary and consisted of several songs which accurately conveyed the scene's emotions and impact.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nOut of all this last season's anime, I looked forward to the release of Tsuki ga Kirei more than any other. I highly enjoyed its ability to bring me back to my freshman year of high school and the challenges of puberty and first loves.  I would definitely recommend it.  \\n\\n\r\nAs stated before, one of this anime's greatest achievements is that it was able to avoid the downfall of so many other romances- contrived drama.  The characters, even when they are wrong, act realistically.  Their relationships are authentic and have weight.  Mix in some solid artwork, a fantastic ost, and enjoyable characters, and you get Tsuki ga Kirei- a 9/10 anime that is a gift to those who enjoy anime romances. \\n\\n\r\nI would also HIGHLY recommend sticking around through the entire ED because many episodes include some shorts.  I would gladly watch an entire show of shorts like these. They are 10/10.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Episode terakhir banyak adegan yang tak disangka namun tetap realistis. Terlebih lagi bagian terakhir yang luar biasa dengan menampilkan pesan chat LINE  dan gambaran kehidupan masing-masing sampai akhirnya menikah membuat saya terdiam sampai akhir. Hal tersebutlah yang membuat saya memberi apresiasi tinggi dan membuat review pertama sama diMyAnimeList. Terima Kasih.,",

            "content": "I will make this simple.  If you enjoy emotional anime then watch this.  If you've already watched it, watch it again.  This anime is amazing in every way.  \r\nStory:\r\nIt's a simple premise.  Middle school students go about their normal everyday life.  Two relatively shy students start dating and we follow their story.  The simplicity is what makes it amazing.  I honestly still don't know why I love this .anime so much but I do and I want to share it with as many people as I can.\r\nArt:\r\nSmooth water colour palate draws more attention to the story andcharacters which are the true star of this.  The ONLY thing that bugged me was the sort of janky 3D models of background characters.  Sadly I am a bit hypervigilant and stuff like this doesn't get passed me.  But I can get passed it.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nVoice acting and music is key to any good anime and this one hits every note perfectly.  From the awkward mumbles to the shy \"sure\" responses everything is done amazingly well.  Also, one of the best opening themes in awhile.  I have it on loop constantly. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nFrom the main roles to the side characters, each is memorable for their role.  Though I personally came to dislike a couple of them but they play key roles to the story.  No character seems out of place.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nAgain,  I still don't know why I love this as much as I do.  I just fell in love with the story and I guess I love going through the wide range of emotions watching it.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI was hooked on the first episode and loved every step (except maybe the re-cap special).  Plus it has possibly the best ending for this genre of anime.  Without giving anything too much away just watch to the very end of episode 12...  I'm seriously fighting off tears writing this and remembering everything.  \\n\\n\r\nWill definitely be binging this completely in the near future.",

This anime reminded me of my first love but it achieved the ending I always longed for but never managed accomplished (that whore dumped because she wanted to date an Asian >_>) These middle school sweethearts made their long distance work out and ended up getting married even though all the odds of succeeding were against them. His writing got through to her, he convinced her that she wasn't a burden on himeven though she thought other wise, she was actually the glue that held him together. The text format they used to show their relationship worked out was a brand new type of approach and it worked splendidly to articulate the rest of the story without having to have a new season or added OVA's. This love story is the best anime I've experienced and I hope to love someone someday the way they love each other.  This story is a testament that long distance can work if the couple loves each other enough to get though it knowing that they will be close one day in the future.",

This is one of those passionate things. Now I don't cry when an anime finishes. Most of the time when I watch one, its to pass the time; and maybe one day I'll hit the jackpot and find that one series that really hits me. Tsukigakirei is one of those. \r\nStory - 10) Granted its not the most original of plotlines, Ive seen plenty other shows with the same premise. HOWEVER, tsukigakirei pulled it off. FUCKING FINALLY,someone did it right. The correct blend of the right characters and plot really goes a long way and this hit a fucking home run in that department. I cannot begin to tell you how long Ive been looking for a series were you have a clear decisive happy ending that shouts \"FUCK YOU\" to all the haters and harem enthusiasts.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 7) Ok so I cant say an incredible amount about the art, its fairly standard, and- *RING RING*, \"2002 called, they want their CGI back.\" But personally I like to think of the art as perfectly imperfect, and the story makes up for it.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9) Yass, its good, music was excellent, fitted well, voicing and actors were well chosen gg wp and all that, sound reviews are boring.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10) Solid 10 for this, because simliar to the story, the characters arent all that original, butt, they were actually done right this time, character attitudes didn't fluctuate to fit the story, and kota was all too relatable to middle school me. The main characters all had some play in the story line and it all intertwined well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10)\\n\r\nIve basically summed up why I love this anime so much, but I think it mainly comes back to how much I could relate to it from when I was young, basically the same thing happened to me, except when my girlfreind had to move away we broke up, but I shit you not 4 years later and we're back together. I think thats why it hits home for me, because I always belived in shitty hopeful romance that never worked out until you met that one person, which is where this series works with that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10) Overall, no word of a lie, a true masterpiece of 2017.\\n\\n\r\n3 cheers for the new owner of KZOs favourite anime crown! *fucking punches angel beats of the podium* HIP HIP HURRAY! But yeah seriously if youre umming and ahhing about whether to watch this anime, stop being a stupid shitebag and fucking watch it. I guarantee itll be worth your time. xx",

            "content": "Tsuki ga Kirei debuted last spring season and proved to be a beautiful anime series. In 12 episodes a love story is told in its simplest, most pure and honest form.\r\nHowever, this new anime series stands out from the other series of the genre because, unlike what is customary in Japanese animations, the focus is not on secondary school students. In Tsuki ga Kirei, the characters are attending elementary school. This difference completely alters the whole narrative. Since the characters are in a younger age group, all the questions that revolve around them will inevitably be different.\r\nTsuki ga Kirei tells the story of Kotaro andAkane, two youngsters in senior year of elementary school. During this last year, the couple will experience a significant experience in the life of any young person: the first love. The anime world is filled with series and films that explore the concept of Tsuki ga Kirei. Some do it with great mastery. Others are a little below expectations. This series depends more on the first option\\n\r\nTsuki ga kirei has a slow start and as the episodes pass, it becomes a real shocking and interesting work, the way to connect akane and kotro make the spectator do not stop accompanying this work\\n\r\nThe focus of the narrative of Tsuki ga Kirei focuses on the experience of the first love of two young people. It all begins when Kotaro and Akane realize each other's existence. There are many exchanges and deviations of looks, much shyness, much shame. They want to talk to each other, but they do not know the typical anime of the genre. And then, the opportunity arises for the first conversation. Gaining a little courage, there they can share the numbers of mobile phones. This is the first phase of history. The period in which the characters develop a mutual interest for each other and manage to approach in a beautiful way and in some ways not clich\u00e9.\\n\r\nAfter the initial approach, the great moment of confession arrives. Unlike other anime, here the confession arrived quite early. For those who accompany anime series of the same genre, know that this is something rare. Most of these series focus the whole drama on the couple's time to express their feelings. However, Tsuki ga Kirei realizes that there is also much drama and conflict in the day-to-day life of a couple. Especially when giving time and space to the characters to have a life, a routine, personal activities that do not involve the boyfriend. So, after a couple of episodes, we have the long-awaited confession.\\n\\n\r\nAccompanying this romantic journey of Kotaro and Akane is, on the one hand, very funny. Because surely anyone who sees the episodes of the series ends up by reviewing the situations experienced by the characters, creating a certain empathy for them. And that makes this journey also quite nostalgic. Because it reminds us of our own experiences. All this is only possible because the series is highly faithful to reality.\\n\r\nAfter the protagonists express their feelings, they officially start dating. The embarrassment that we saw initially remains, but also shows that the characters are getting more comfortable with each other. And little by little, other adversities and complications appear in the relationship of Kotaro and Akane. For example, try to understand what you are supposed to do as a couple. Or the famous jealousy, the first discussion. Anyway, all that is natural to happen, especially in these ages where the young are still maturing.\\n\r\nThe drama of the series focuses heavily on these moments, which are essential in a relationship. But it does not become melodramatic or exaggerated. Each of these situations has a purpose. They allow the relationship of Kotaro and Akane to evolve, as does the story itself. But not only. As well as the protagonists growing together, they also do it individually. This is something very important that must be referred to. Another relevant aspect is that the development of each is influenced by the other. It reminds us a little bit what happens to the couple from the movie Mimi wo sumaseba, from Studio ghibli\\n\r\n.\\n\r\nstrong point : The portrait true to the reality of both the characters and the experience of first love.\\n\r\nComplaint: The CGI animation. In a beautiful animation that reminds us of Makoto Shinkai's works, it's a shame that the CGI animated parts (eg, crowd animation) are so poorly made. They completely discard the rest\\n",

We all know those characters that are one: annoying two: they are just stupid to understand three: they don't know how to handle things or they just actall the same. In this anime the main characters are really shy and nice, they care about each other (no fights) and they all have there own personality. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime is realistic and fun to watch!\\n\\n\r\nSo I hope I will not spoil to much so I'm gonna warn you guys.\\n\\n\r\nSo the story is about 2 shy people who fall in love with each other. Time by time they get closer and really form a relationship. With there own goals in mind and things that they like, they are ready for there last year before highschool. The girl loves running and the boy loves writing. But by the time they grow apart and the main protagonist really fights for his love. and want's to stay with here <3.\\n\\n\r\nLike the other anime this one has some love rivals but they are not so annoying as the others.

            "content": "Previously on LA's Kuzu no Honkai anime review...\r\n\"LA doesn't care if the characters are horrible and hormonal because they can be very relatable thus LA can't really fault these characters because seriously, hormonal teenagers makes dumb mistakes all the time especially from something as complicated and depressing as love let alone unrequited.\"\r\nOk...Tsuki ga Kirei is a good puppy love exception it seems.\r\nLA looking at Tsuki ga Kirei quite early on, LA being the extremely cynical type to romance in the media, LA wrote Tsuki ga Kirei off as a cliched puppy love romance story with \"expected results\", however LA surprisingly quickly over time, LA startedto enjoy this puppy love romance.\\n\\n\r\nIf there is something Tsuki ga Kirei does right is how \"realistic\" the main romance as well as a few of the beta couples do interact with and sure our main romantic couple of Kotarou Azumi voiced by Shouya Chiba, a struggling introverted amateur author and Akane Mizuno voiced by Konomi Kohara, a typical shy yet sociable highschool girl who's in the track team is best summed up as \"sickly sweethearts\", even their relationship goes through a few trials and tribulations of it's own, from them trying to keep their relationship a secret to their friends, family issues changing their relationship in a big way to jealousy and other love interests to the both of them affecting their relationship. See Tsuki ga Kirei's main romantic plotline has it's cake but has restraint from eating TOO much of it, thus LA can see this as realistic albeit towards sickly sweethearts. Other supporting characters do help move their relationship along be it good or bad, such as the aforementioned love interests (ESPECIALLY towards Chinatsu Nishio voiced by Rie Murakawa, Akane's friend to Azumi was tearjerking to say the least but even then, Chinatsu and Azumi never went on hating each other and by the end of it Chinatsu was one of LA's favourite characters in the anime!), family issues that typically involves school and getting into college was a big factor and once in which oddly enough Junko Azumi voiced by Kikuko Inoue, Azumi's mother was a great benefactor in helping Azumi achieve his goals in many ways (for his future AND his relationship with Akane). Character-wise as much as this isn't relatable to LA, LA KNOWS that the main romance was realistic enough with character depths LA even wasn't expecting from certain characters.\\n\\n\r\nTsuki ga Kirei also seemed to touch themes on how modern day romance is now played out due to LINE (a real life communication app...no seriously) as well as how millennial's deal with romances as well as achieving your goals, sure that last one sounded cheesy there but even Akane and Azumi has other things to do other than their romance, with Akane's track and Azumi's writing (and even an uncontextualized jab at light novels) it gives them a bit more depth as a characters instead of being stereotypically in love and that's ALL they think about. \\n\\n\r\nStill from this as much as a focused main romance Tsuki ga Kirei has, it does like to make playful fun scenarios at times and those goes to skits after the after credits, looking at some of the beta couples or minor characters having a bit more of a focus to some skits based around them and they do touch on \"how millennial's deal with romances\" with a comedic edge to them. LA's favourite skits would be ANYTHING focusing on Ryouka Sonoda voiced by Nao Touyama.\\n\\n\r\nLA has to say that for an original anime done by Studio feel, this was one hell of a surprise from them as LA at the start was indifferent to Studio feel. but over time with Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru. Zoku, Oshiete! Galko-chan and Kono Bijutsubu ni wa Mondai ga Aru!, they seemed to have honed in, in what they are good at, that being realistic with a funny edge animes (genre varies) and has become a more reliable anime company to say the least as LA writes this and Tsuki ga Kirei is another great example for Studio feel.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation by Studio feel, LA really liked the characters designs and although it suffered from a bit of same face syndrome, some of the characters were recognizable just for their actions alone and NOT their appearance. The backgrounding was gorgeous to be expected although there is only one gripe with the animation and that goes to the awful CGI used within the backgrounds. LA has a rule about CGI and that is if it's used on humans, IT NEEDS TO BE DONE IN GREAT DETAIL or make the entire thing CGI otherwise there will be an uncanny effect making them like lifeless dolls and that soured the backgrounds ALL the time. But nonetheless, the animation was used well for the most part and gave some gorgeous scenery.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of voice acting, well having newbie seiyuu's like Shouya Chiba and Konomi Kohara was pretty good in this anime and although there a veterans and mainstay seiyuu's in this anime voice cast like Nao Touyama, Kikuko Inoue, Chiwa Saito and Haruka Chigusa, this voice cast was stellar giving major props to both Shouya Chiba and Konomi Kohara in this regard. Now LA usually doesn't talk soundtrack and music but this NEEDS to be said and the entire soundtrack, Opening and Ending themes are covered by Nao Touyama and her calming vocals. LA just loved this soundtrack including the Opening as well and LA want to see more from Nao Touyama in this area AS well as more from her in terms of character roles in the future (Nao Touyama fanboy speaking here if that's not obvious).\\n\\n\r\nTsuki ga Kirei is one of the hidden gems of Spring 2017 for LA and for someone like LA, a cynical person in viewing romance in the media let alone puppy love romances bloom like this in a reasonable and realistic way and even having LA's approval in the ways it's executed with it's strengths of it's many characters and themes it vehemently upholds along with a tearjerking finale is some feat for Tsuki ga Kirei. Sure it will turn some people away looking for darker romances instead of this schmaltzy played out romance, but Tsuki ga Kirei does it's job well in portraying a sickly sweethearts puppy love romance with it's trials and tribulations it entails.\\n\\n\r\nHey, LA might be a cynical bastard when looking at romance in the media, if the romance however schmaltzy has heart and a good story, it can warm the most cynical of romanticists....hopefully.",

            "content": "\"If there is such a thing as god of fate, he must be quite a troll\" \r\nquote of the year! \r\nTsuki ga Kirei is a love story too pure for the 21st century. It's like the anime that will make you want to get back with the ex girlfriend that you never had. It's a very sweet, innocent tale of two innocent kids from two very different worlds who cross paths and fall in love. The anime depicts their relationship when it's at a very premature stage, They don't know what to do or expect and it makes you curious in what direction they willgo. It focuses on their trails and tribulations of trying to overcoming peer pressure, family pressure and focusing on one's ambition.\\n\\n\r\nThis is an anime original so i didn't know what to expect when I started this and it was quite underrated during the start of spring but I'm glad it became a little more popular, it gained quite a momentum towards the end and I hope it continues to be more successful.\\n\\n\r\nThe two main characters are really great, they are very relatable, even if you have never been in a relationship (I know i haven't been in one) they really resonate with you. They are portrayed as realistic as possible and they have moments where, you know, being the main character of the show didn't help them, which was quite refreshing honestly. This whole anime is a beautiful struggle and it's great to watch them grow and develop from being shy introverted characters to making some bold decisions. It just makes you wanna root for them.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was pretty good, the art was simple but effective, it set a tone that fit well with the location and the atmosphere of the anime. It feels very nostalgic. The music is the real deal though, the songs are so good and the soundtrack compliments the romantic vibe so well you might even skip a beat. Oh! and I would be stupid to leave out the after credit monologues in every episodes, that alone makes this show worth watching!\\n\\n\r\nBut I can see some people who might find this anime to be boring, it's quite slow and the cellphone LINE conversations that they often have throughout the show might have people rolling their eyes. I didn't really have a big problem with it but I can see people calling this out, if you're not a fan of romance in general and find it to be a corny genre, I can't guarantee that this will change your mind. The problem I had with this show are the side characters, some of their behavior is just clich\u00e9 and annoying. None of them are explored and they lack screen time, personally to me they come off as very one dimensional.\\n\\n\r\nBut yeah, Overall it was a very good anime and I really enjoyed it. It has a lot of elements that make it truly worthwhile. If you're a fan of the romance genre, this is an anime that you cannot miss.\\n\\n\r\nMy rating:- 7.5/10",

So at first i thought this anime was LN/novel adaptation, because really, it gives the same excitement as when u watch LN adaptation Anime. actually 2016 was really the gate of revolutionary original work of anime. It began with \"SEIREN\" series that really got a neat story withomnibus setting. and now we got \"TSUKI GA KIREI\" as the bridge to the revolutionary original work (lol i said it twice sry). I really thought the OP should be as good as its ED, well, the others are fine for me. So yeah, WATCH IT! ( >,<)/",

Simple, clean, and nice. They actually start dating pretty early on which is always a plus. After that it\u2019s basically just the simple relationship drama with another girl liking the boy another guy liking the girl. But it\u2019s not a drama heavy series with what drama it does have not really making you scared that they are going to break up or anything like that. \\n\\n\r\nArt-7\\n\r\nThe art is lackluster at best, there\u2019s no real moments when you just look at it and think to yourself \u201cwow that is some good art\u201d there\u2019s a few and I mean a few moments when the animation is perfection but like most anime they are rare and short. \\n\\n\r\nSound-6\\n\r\nI got to be honest I\u2019ve never been that picky with sound unless it was like an old anime with bad sound but this has just the same old same old anime sounds. The voice acting is pretty good in my opinion, the VAs really give the characters their well...... character by being quiet, shy, and not all that outgoing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-9\\n\r\nOh boy how I loved these characters, Kotar\u014d Azumi is a pretty likable guy. He\u2019s pretty quiet and not the most outgoing guy but he\u2019s interesting. He\u2019s attracted to Akane Mizuno pretty early on and actually becomes texting buddies with her fairly quickly. Which in turn let\u2019s you see one of the best character traits I\u2019ve seen in awhile. When he texts with Akane and he gets super happy or asks a big question he\u2019ll jump up from his bed and start \u201cboxing\u201d his light switch that\u2019s  hanging down and I always love that, I find it to be very funny and pretty relatiable to be honest.there is some other characters in there that are kinda interesting like the other love interests but they are not part of my review I am only talking about the 2 main characters.\\n\\n\r\n*Spoiler heavy section*\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-10\\n\r\nLike I said above I got bored with this series early on and when I came back I still had some boring spots to watch, but where my overall enjoyment of this series comes from, why I\u2019ve given it an outstanding 10/10 on Mal and why I\u2019m even writing a review about it in the first place is the ENDING. And holy crap is it the BEST ending I\u2019ve ever seen in an anime EVER.IF YOU DONT LIKE SPOILERS STOP READING NOW!!! So this anime\u2019s ending isn\u2019t actually what I\u2019m talking about though I\u2019m talking about the ending CREDITS yah that\u2019s right the end credits. The ending itself is pretty good with the girl going away and the boy chasing after the train a yelling out to her while she reads his text explaining how he loves her so so so much. Which in itself is really good but then the creators of this anime go a step further and during the credits(god save you if you missed em) it shows pictures and the texts they send each other throughout their LIVES!!! Yah their whole lives with them having long distance that actually works(SAY WHAT) and then them getting jobs and moving in together and living together and getting MARRIED and having a KID!!!! It\u2019s honestly adorable and the cutest thing ever. And is totally worth watching all of it just for that. It made me happy cry, I cried so hard watching it but of just pure happiness because they truly love each other soooo much and you see that in the end credits. It\u2019s not only the best ending I\u2019ve ever seen but also the most satisfying ending I\u2019ve ever seen you see what happens to these characters you\u2019ve watched for 12 episodes. And you just feel such happiness for them. \\n\\n\r\n*End spoiler section*\\n\\n\r\nOverall-10 \\n\r\nlike I said before my most enjoyment came from the end credits. That is why I gave this anime a 10/10 and why im even writing a review about it in the first place. I highly recommend this anime to anyone who\u2019s a fan of romance or SoL. You won\u2019t find a more satisfying or happy anime anywhere else and if you\u2019ve already seen it which I\u2019m guessing most of you have. TELL YOUR FRIENDS!!! You may not have the patience to watch a whole anime just for the ending but its definitely worth it and there\u2019s still plenty of good moments in between that really let you get to love the characters. \\n\\n\r\nPhew wow that was my first full length review on an anime and I think I did pretty good(I hope I did at least) I hope I got some people to watch it and I definitely hope I might\u2019ve changed some people\u2019s minds on what they think about it.\\n",

            "content": "This is my first review. These are my feelings of the anime in regards to how I liked it, not necessarily how I think most people would like it.\r\nThis is a spoiler-free review.\r\nThe story isn't phenomenal, but it's realistic and consistent. It's exactly what it says it is and does exactly what it sets out to do - to tell a story of a bunch of middle-schoolers in Japan. Though I tend to enjoy slice-of-life, I was mildly disappointed at its simplicity. 5/10\r\nI really like the art style used in this anime - it's probably my favorite of all anime I've seen thus far. Theonly other anime of feel.'s that I've seen is Oregairu, so I didn't know what the studio's style was really going to be like, but I was quite impressed even just after the first episode. The only complaint I have is that the crowds look like absolute garbage to the point that I thought they were incomplete for some odd reason. 9/10, still.\\n\\n\r\nI personally don't care much for vocal music outside of OPs and EDs, and this anime had enough instances of its use to annoy me just a little. The background music the rest of the time isn't anything phenomenal, but it's by no means poor. 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were well-crafted, though that's easy enough to do considering the genre and the amount of characters that the anime cared to delve into (I'd argue only two and maybe three characters get flushed out to the point of satisfaction). Interactions are natural and the studio does a very good job of imitating middle-school life, which turns out to be both a positive and a negative for this anime in my opinion. Again, nothing and nobody amazing or genre-defining by any means, but a pretty decent cast all the same. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThough I enjoy slice-of-life, I realise it probably has the most potential of any genre to be incredibly boring. While that 's part of what makes up my overall lack of enjoyment, the kicker is how close to reality it is, as I mentioned in the previous paragraph. I'm not too far out of middle school myself, and the anime pretty successfully reminded me of several instances of awkwardness and cringe that only the environment of a middle-school can so masterfully produce. I personally watch slice-of-life anime to enjoy what a realistic yet fortunate life can turn out to be; it gives one a sense of hope and contentment. This anime has the inverse effect. Now, if your middle-school experience wasn't so bad as to periodically give you flashbacks that make you want to die, or you're old enough to have the memories be much fuzzier, then you'll probably have a decent chance at enjoying this anime. However, given my age and circumstance, I did not.\\n\r\nStill, some moments were enjoyable. The romance wasn't so bad, though a little slow. The parts I looked forward to the most were the ends of the episodes, where we get to see what the other characters were up to. Those were fun. 3/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, 6/10. I could probably rate even lower, but the title's too good for a five.",

The pause in the music when he said \"I love you\" was my favorite scene because it shows he is taking action. Love is all about who has the courage to make a change and a single sentence can change the fate of who you will be with and be happy with for the rest of your life. If you don't say anything then that person will be swept away by someone else's love that rivaled yours. The final scene with theirbaby was truly beautiful.

            "content": "Tsuki Ga Kirei is a story about first love, young love and making love work through hardships.\r\nStory & Characters: The Story centers around Akane and Kotaru, two junior high students who through a series of coincidences fall in love. They have different hobbies, friends and situations. You follow their lives as they go through their last year before highschool, with love triangles, jealousy, nervousness and other feelings being major themes. The story is beautifully written, but has e few small bumps in it's road. One of these bumps is the lack of backstory for many of the characters. The characters themselves all have their ownpersonality and avoid falling into the usual tropes, but has little backstory. This is not a major problem as they are young and therefore wouldn't usually have a long story, but some more backstory would not have hurt. The story tackles many issues in a relatively realistic way and thereby gets easier to insert yourself into.\\n\r\nArt & Sound: The art is probably the big let down in this anime, with not the best drawn characters (though the background are well done) adn a large use of bad CGI animations for characters moving in the background, making it somewhat awkward to watch. The sound is solid, but not exactly  enough to send me to heaven, just good.\\n\r\nOverall: I enjoyed the show a lot and watched everything in just two sessions. I can recommend this show for fans of slice of life or romance stories, and I ask not to judge the art to harshly.\\n\r\nEnjoy!",

            "content": "Definitely one of the best school-life, romance animes ever. I had never watched a school romance anime until coming across this masterpiece. I have a list of my personal top list of romance anime and Tsuki ga Kirei is definitely one of the few on the top of my list. \r\nOne of the best things about this story is how original the plot is, how it gets straight to the point. At the start we are introduced with our 2 main protagonists, who will eventually fall in love and become a couple. They are just 2 students in their last year of junior high, aboutto move on in life and go to high school. Their relation starts with the usual awkwardness, shyness and anxiety between 2 teenagers of the opposite sex. As the story progresses, we are able to see how they are able to try and surpass these issues. I definitely feel that this anime is so enjoyable because many of us can relate to them, and how they feel. Another thing I really enjoyed and was grateful for was that even though there were love triangles, the plot doesn't expand much on that and mainly focuses on the main relation between the 2 teenagers, Akane and Koutarou. There were no typical anime 'cliches' and was just a simple romance story about 2 normal teenagers. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime had decent visual artwork, and the music and songs were great too, with many of the soundtracks coming in at the right moment in the story to produce a masterpiece for many of us to enjoy. The characters were well developed and even the extra, secondary characters added some atmosphere to the story. \\n\\n\r\nThe only thing that I really felt disappointed about was that I felt the ending was a bit rushed. I would have enjoyed a second season or even an OVA to let the audience understand what happened to them later on in life and let us truly say goodbye to the 2. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I felt that this was a truly outstanding anime and definitely deserves a 9/10. However, if you aren't looking for any romance stories and looking for action or anything different, I wouldn't suggest this anime for you.  \\n\\n",

Completed this treasure yesterday and still have lingering feelings from when I watched the ending. I personally hate even the most vague of spoilers. So I will also do my best to avoid such situations even though I know it is difficult to do.\r\nThe story journeys the lives of 2 middle school students that were just classmates until a recent series of meetings/events entwined their fates. It is a very cute , innocent , and pure anime that really draws youin emotionally because you can totally relate to most of the things that happen within the anime. We all have our first loves , first girlfriends and first kisses that we all treasure . We cherish the feeling of comfort and pleasure these emotions give and it really incites you to think back on your past.\\n\\n\r\nTsuki ga Kirei confronts the common challenges faced in every relationship (e.g uncertainty and many more ,please watch to find out ) and shows a beautiful way of how these young teenagers face each challenge. \\n\\n\r\nIt is an anime that makes you reflect on your past (if you can relate) and give you a sense of comfort and ease.\\n\\n\r\nIt does a good job of combining drama with romance and it even manages to include some wholesome comedic relief. \\n\\n\r\nI love the Art Style , its not the usual pen and marker 3D animation , but sadly i don't know how to describe the art. I would say it looks like paint but not really? Anyways, it is really refreshing and it totally fits the mood and vibe the content gives. \\n\\n\r\nVoice acting was amazingly done by Kohara Konomi and Chiba Shoya, their voices by itself are soothing and lively but it was elevated to greater heights their passion and emotion . I absolutely love how Konomi (Akane) sounds in this anime , it just sounds so natural and bright . OST's are one of the most important things to make an anime shine and they do it perfectly in this series. ED is good but OP is even better. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall , Tsuki ga Kirei is a must watch for anyone that enjoys Romance, Slice of life. I personally rate it 11/10 and it's good enough for me to crown it my Favourite romance anime immediately after I finished it . I think this is also a good choice or anyone who would like to venture out of Action or Shounen as well. \\n\\n\r\nLast but not least , another reason Tsuki ga Kirei is remarkably wholesome and satisfactory because it doesn't leave you hanging like every other anime there is ;)\\n",

            "content": "Short and sweet review. Do you know what to expect from romance anime and are tired of people pointing out the \"genre stereotypes\" and then judging the anime only around that? Just want to know the important stuff and if you should watch it? I've got you covered.\r\nThis show is my new standard for good romance anime. I literally can not heap enough praise onto this show, and that is a major surprise because it is set in middle school.\r\nTsuki ga Kirei is one of those rare romance animes that hit all the right spots and stick the landing every time. Not only is thepacing epic, especially for a 13 episode show, but the characters are realistic and enticing, the story-line is dramatic without being unrealistic, and the main character's romance actually progresses in a natural way thanks to them being humans instead of weird Japanese romance trope robots who do nothing but blush. I will address each of these things in order below.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing of this show is great. There is no boring episodes, or filler story, or superfluous exposition. Every episode has a complete beginning, middle, and ending arc but is part of the overall 13 episode story. Every time the credits hit, you will be scrambling to start the next episode. The entire pacing of the show hinges on the romance and not some other stupid school-related story or side character or random plot point like so many other romances NEED in order to fill out a season.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are what make this show how great it is. They are middle-school aged, so the first episode they can barely look at each other. Sounds familiar right? Except they will surprise you at EVERY turn. Not because their reactions or interactions are crazy or outlandish, but because they ARE NOT. Their reactions are so human. And their reactions to what others say and do are believable and well thought out. They will also change right before your eyes in the best ways possible. The male lead CONSTANTLY grows a pair at the best moments, \"manning up\" in situations where characters in other anime would wimp out, run away, or take another half-season to even consider doing something. The female lead does the same thing, not wimping out or failing to speak their mind at key moments, not running away, etc. It was SO refreshing to see a romance take shape so quickly, yet still so naturally. The side characters are all well thought out and have their role to play, but don't become the center of attention at any point nor do they have any unnecessary development that isn't required for their part. They are there as a foil and as soon as they play their part they are not important anymore and have less scenes.\\n\\n\r\nRather than avoiding the normal romance anime pitfalls, Tsuki ga Kirei just plows right through them. Awkward moments? One of the characters mans up. Side-character confesses? Barely even 1 episode total spent dealing with it. Missed opportunity for a kiss/hug/etc? Happens anyway moments later or the next episode. Every time this show will surprise you with where it goes, because we've all been so conditioned by anime like Kimi ni Todoke or Toradora to think that romance developments can only happen if they are painfully slow paced, and only when the main characters have been oblivious/shy/stupid when it comes to the romance for at least 50% of the show.\\n\\n\r\nAnd oh my god the feels in this show. I found myself pausing several times to just take a breath, and for once it wasn't because I was frustrated. Usually it was because I was generally happy or I was sad about something that had just happened. Your heartstrings will be yanked on dozens of times throughout this show and only in the best ways. There were more genuinely HAPPY moments in this show than most other anime I have watched, along with several moments that made me jump out of my seat and cheer out loud.\\n\\n\r\nWatch this show. If you love romance anime, watch it. If you hate romance anime, watch it. If you used to love romance anime, definitely watch it. You will not be disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nTHIS IS A PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT FOR ANYONE WHO LIKES HAPPY ENDINGS IN THEIR ROMANCE ANIME (VERY MILD SPOILER WARNING AHEAD):\\n\\n\r\nTHIS SHOW HAS A HAPPY ENDING! However, you won't know that it does unless you watch the credits of the last episode. The way the episode ends before the credits you may think it either ended badly or in the traditional \"That PROBABLY happened but we won't know because it's the end!\" kinda way. But that's not the case! Be sure to be ready to PAUSE playback, as the ending is mostly a slideshow of moments in the future that occur after the story in the last episode ends. You'll be reading LINE messages between characters from future events for the most part, so be sure to watch and read everything. The final shot before the end of the credits will give you all the closure you need :) Great ending, despite my desire for more.\\n\\n\r\nHIGHLIGHTS: The male character has a set of balls, the female character isn't stupid, the characters actually EVOLVE within the beginning of the show as well as the end, the music is great, the animation is unique (even though it's been done similarly before), your heartstrings will be tugged in legitimate ways, and the ending is HAPPY!\\n\\n\r\nDISAPPOINTMENTS: It wasn't longer, \"epilogue\" is just still images/chat messages from milestones in their lives after middle-school, there is no sequel at all (not even an OVA)\\n\\n\r\nNote: I re-wrote this review to match the quality of my more recent ones on 9/13/2018.

            "content": "Now, a High School Romance is the first thing that comes to my mind when asked about Anime Romance. My Experiences with High School Romance anime have been mostly on the comedic side, some are done brilliantly, whilst others... Not so much.\r\nHowever, watching this anime was quite a hollow moment for me.\r\nWhy?\r\nWell... When I watch a good anime, I get a tingly feeling, what I would describe as a \"fizz\". That 'fizz' raises the bar for the next anime I watch.\r\nAgain, how does it feel hollow?\r\nWelp.\r\nIt's because I will now, live with the fact that I will never quite find another anime that would giveme a bigger \"fizz\" then when I was watching Tsuki ga Kirei for years and years to come. \\n\\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nI have always had a love/hate relationship with Original animes, as compared to the animes based on a novel. Why?\\n\\n\r\nIt's because in an Original anime if the story ends... that's it. There is no Manga to carry on the story, you just have to sit there, waiting, praying that it will carry on.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, when I think about it, Tsuki ga Kirei made me sad yet happy, I would rather have it end that way, then to suddenly lift the spirit up. This is why we don't have a second Plastic Memories.\\n\\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest this review (if you can call it that) is just to get my personal rambling out of the way.\\n",

When I first started seeing Tsuki Ga Kirei, I imagined a series alongside younger characters. I have no words to describe what I was looking for.\r\nHistory: 8,0\r\nThe title is presented, presented a world of characters with enough force, in an age range that is used in anime. The first episodes are from this series and are to presentus the protagonists, with the passage of the episodes of success, exploring the characters and the relationship of the protagonists, with leaves of humor, and a perfect end to a work that was built very well. Worth the \"post-credits\" scene, which in addition to thrill me even more my satisfaction.\\n\\n\r\nProduction: 6.5\\n\r\nAs it is an anime from a slice of life, it is not required the animation of a great amount of movement to make and feel, knowing this, although it could do much more, it was made an animation for this type of anime. The soundtracks are well fitted and do not bother. Character design is a weakness and a strong point. Weak point for being very simple, with the exception of the Roman. And a high point to increase the truth-resemblance of the anime, after all, is not all the same as characters with green and red hair in an ordinary school, is not it?\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8,0\\n\r\nProbably the biggest chord in the piece is how they work with their characters. Their personalities, actions, reactions, are in agreement with the adolescents, after all they are the adolescents, immature, beginning to know their feelings and to know the world in which they live. Besides, of course, they are very charismatic.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Review: 9.0\\n\r\nTsuki Ga Kirei had a lot of fun, thrilled me, arrested me, and most of all: I left happy. It's an anime that will be forever on my kokoro and on my favorite list & lt",

No need to worry about a season 2 that we all know that even if it did come up, it'd be too late and half the people that watched the original wouldn't be back for the next chapter. The characters are veryhuman, almost comparable to all of us before we became shut ins and watched Japanese cartoons without social interaction.",

I love this Anime not just because the romance.

            "content": "I have to say that this anime is genuinely breathtaking and if you're looking for a romance that isn't cliche and delivers a really powerful message with a great story you've came to the right place.\r\nI'll conclude my review within the five sections. (Story, Art, Sound, Character, Enjoyment & Overall) I will try to keep this as spoiler-free as possible, but their may be a few occasional slip up's so be warned!\r\nStory (9/10): So when I started this anime I did kind of expect it to be cliche off the bat seeing as the two MC's are introduced to eachother in a cliche fashion, butthe anime seems to take a more direct turn than prolonging where the story is trying to go and I really condeme this anime for doing that. What most romance animes accomplish in the span of the entire series; this anime manages to do in the matter of a few episodes and that's something fairly unique about this show. The story gets to the point and it's something I want in a show. I gave the story a 9/10 instead of full 10 because there were some points within the story where the pacing was a bit slow and it got on my nerves, but perhaps that's just me being impatient. Anywhom that concludes this section of the review.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10): The art was beautiful & I am a sucker for colourful scenery which this anime is more than happy to use. It just makes the show much more satisfying to watch when you have vibrant colors & well drawn scenery  in every episode. The only issue I have with the art is the 3d art animation, the running etc, looked awkward as anything and out of place. This doesn't really ruin the immersion whatsoever but when they over-use the animation sometimes it's a little iffy in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10): The soundtrack is beautiful and well used in the scenes they try to convey certain emotions in. The music made me feel tense in the intense situations, sad in the sad situations & happy in the happy situations. When a soundtrack has the ability to do that you know it's good. 10/10 for me completely.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8/10): The characters for the most part are ACTUALLY relatable to? A lot of romances these days seem to set the boundaries so high that you unfortunatly can't relate to the MC because you feel like it's been set up so perfectly for them that it isn't a reality you could relate to. But this anime truly makes you relate to in many ways with how the MC feels and the situations hes put in. It feel's like the characters are so easy to relate to if you've ever had a crush on someone and just been anxious around that person you want to talk to. The best characters are the ones you can relate to & this show does a high amount of relating to.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10): For practically the majority of the anime I found myself clinging on the back of my chair when situations got tense, smiling like a idiot when happy/soppy moments occured and finding myself sad when there would be emotional scenes & it's been a long time since a romance anime as managed to captivate me and pull me in as much as this one. Of course there were a few issues I stated out within sections of the review, but they arent that noticeable and I'm sure I'm being picky, but they don't take away from how amazing this anime is.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10): To me this is a must watch if you're a romance fanatic. It's a romance you can easily relate to and mkaes you feel for each character and look at it from their perspective. The only reason this gets a 9 instead of a 10 is because I think there are few minor details that could be touched up on and I think my main point relies on pacing being a little tedious in some instances, but they're minor and aren't consistant throughout the entire anime so this gets a solid 9 for me. As I said, a must watch.",

            "content": "**May contain spoilers**\r\n''There's such a thing as love in this world. I'm sure of it.'' ~ Dazai\r\nI had never heard of Tsuki Ga Kirei before and I'm sure I would never have found it if a certain someone hadn't recommended it to me. I didn't know what to expect and I must say I was pleasantly suprised. Now if you don't like romance or high school stories, then Tsuki ga Kirei is not for you and I suggest you watch something else.\r\nStory - 9/10\r\nTsuki ga Kirei was an original, realistic and refreshing story about an high school romance. For a typical high school romance itreally stood out. The romance and dialogues were convincing and felt close to realistic. Even though towards the end it gets a bit clich\u00e9, I really enjoyed the story. Tsuki ga Kirei showed me that teenage years can be quite interesting and don't need dramatic events to keep me watching. That's why Tsuki ga Kirei is not comparable to Clannad/Angel Beats/Charlotte. I enjoyed the drama/romance in the 3 animes listed above, but they didn't feel realistic in my opinion. And that's where Tsuki ga Kirei shines as an original realistic take on high school romance. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 7/10\\n\r\nTsuki ga Kirei was close to perfect (to me), if it wasn't for the sloppy animation. I really liked the art-style and the facial expressions were done extremely well. Such a shame that crowds or walking animations were absolutely terrible. I don't know the exact reason for this, but it didn't really affect the story in general. Still it could've been done much better.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8/10\\n\r\nI don't quite remember anything of the soundtrack. Today I looked up some of the OST and I wasn't disappointed. Really emotional and moving soundtrack. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 9/10\\n\r\nAs a main character Azumi was a very interesting, but not an original character. He's a typical shy kid with a regular group of friends. Mizuno on the contrary is a more popular and athletic character (shy nonetheless). The way these two characters fall in love was very much like how normal kids would fall in love. It starts with eye contact and before you know it they start texting everyday. (Texting is actually a very important theme in this anime and the use of LINE is necessary for this love-story to happen). Their conversations in real-life start out as awkward and contain lots of silences. However, the more the better they get to know each other the more they begin to open-up to one another. This leads to them eventually dating each other. I mentioned friends before, but I haven't mentioned the use of friends in Tsuki ga Kirei. Friends are actually a key-factor in this story. Both the Azumi and Mizuno started out as really embarassed about their relation and this led to many misunderstandings. Hearts were broken and friendships were almost lost. Even the use of parents and family in this anime was really realistic compared to other anime like (uhum) almost every other high school romance. With the exception of the two main characters I actually didn't care for many other characters. There were some other characters I liked, but they weren't interesting enough for me to actually care for them like I do for the main characters. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9/10\\n\r\nIn general I really enjoyed this anime and I was quite disappointed it was only 12 episodes. Nonetheless I liked how the story went and how it ended, so there is no need for a second season or sequel. I definitely learned a lot myself and it got me thinking about my own life. I'm in my final year of high school and next year I'm going to university (hopefully). I could relate to a lot of this anime and it's definitely worth a watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9/10\\n\r\nDespite the horrible walking animations I would recommend Tsuki ga Kirei to anyone who enjoyes a good high school romance. If you're looking for an eventful and dramatic romance story, then Tsuki ga Kirei is not the anime for you and I would recommend Clannad or Charlotte. If you do enjoy a realistic high scool romance, then I definitely recommend this anime to you. Tsuki ga Kirei is a gem and deserves so much more attention, so I suggest you recommend this to your friends if you enjoyed it.",

It gives the person watching an intimate realization that these are actually two individuals trying to figure out their place in each other's world and the connection it provides is nothingless short of perfection.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this to anyone that likes anime. Dare I say anyone that likes to feel happy. This is that show. An epitome of a great and memorable story.",

You could tell after some episodes. The story has good development overtime. The pace is not too fast or tooslow. Perfect. A relatable story that happen to adults these days.

In dialog, action and interactions.\r\n(Semi Character Development Spoilers Below)\r\nThe growth in their relationship feels so natural. They are understanding, but still are kids whenit comes to their logic. I like how sometimes you can't tell what is going on in their heads or expressions.

In this modern era of anime where almost all romance anime being aired was either a harem/ecchi(nope not ecchi But Super Ecchi to the point where it can be labeled in the same category as hentai), i'm not saying that all ecchi/harem/romance anime are bad of course there are few out there that are worth watching but for the most part its a big disappointment. One day While searching for a goodromance anime to watch i accidentally saw Tsuki Ga kirei and immediately add it to my list and to be honest I'm really expecting a lot of great things about this anime because its an original work created by feel Studio. While watching the this anime i become really interested to the point that i'm starting grinning for whatever reason(of course you know the reason behind those grins) anyway what i wanted to point out is that tsuki ga kirei is one of those few romane anime who prioritize its main point and not some useless ecchi stuff and its really worth watching. I hope other studio who's planning to create some original romance anime got inspired of those few studio's like feel.\\n\r\nScores:\\n\r\nStory: 10/10 Its unique specially to this modern era of anime\\n\r\nArt: 10/10    The art was amazing \\n\r\nSound: 10/10 both opening and ending theme are great/enjoyable.\\n\r\nCharacter:10/10 one of the few anime where all characters are not annoying(well in my opinion only)\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10 i enjoy each episodes of this anime <3\\n\r\nOverall:10/10 This Anime was Masterpiece  <3",

If someone asked me to recommend them a romance show this would be my first choice. \r\nWhen i first started watching this show it was kind of slow paced and even boring at times (maybe because I just wasn't into it), but then after like a few episodes i really started to relate to this show like no other.

            "content": "Going into a romance show, I've had my experiences with white album 2 and toradora, where white album 2 was a love triangle done well, and toradora being 2 lovers that are blind. I was expecting a basic love triangle going into the show and came out with a smile on my face with emotions through the roof. Tsuki ga Kirei tells the story of 2 inexperienced lovers that are extremely shy, and have a respectable amount of privacy and room for\r\neach other. This tells a different \r\nStory 9/10\r\nTsuki ga Kirei tells the story of 2 inexperienced lovers that are extremely shy and have arespectable amount of privacy and room for each other. This tells a different tale, as there is a rare chance of encountering fan service and avoids any sort of sexualization of anything. Where I feel the story, shines are the general themes of reality set throughout the story, seeing how they play a big factor where plots turn around, and how it affects the plot development. This show incredibly captures high school relationships, as a main way of communication for the main characters are using texts, or LINE in the show. Although this would seem like a boring turnaround for the show and be a lame and lazy way of holding conversations with no atmosphere, I feel its applaudable in this situation due to the lovers being shy and having trouble holding conversations, as it is how they open to each other more and indulge in each others life. \\n\\n\r\nArt 5/10\\n\r\nMostly the reason why the art is so low is due to the CG in the show being extremely horrific. The creators being lazy put cg models for characters in crowds and in cutscenes, and it just ruined the mood. Having an emotional moment be ruined by everyone but the main characters being cg and looking super shit ruined it for me. \\n\r\nAlso, I didn't mind the character art and how they looked, it's somewhat basic but nothing too major.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\r\nThe music is nice, but it isn't anything special that'll blow you out of the park. Some nice piano instrumentals, opening and ending is pretty good, but nothing spectacular.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 8/10\\n\r\nPart of the reason I wasn't liking the show at first was because I saw a lack of character development and neither of them were trying to break out of their shyness. However, I soon noticed that they did include character development in there, they showed that they found out ways to work around it, and I loved it. Kotarou, being shy with talking likes to express his emotions through literature and uses it to express his true emotions on paper. Akane generally likes to demonstrate her emotions through LINE, building courage by squeezing her plush enough due to her anxiety, and finds enough courage to tell others about her relationship status. \\n\r\nAkane can work through her anxiety and tell Kotarou how she feels, and Kotarou also finds courage to stand up for himself and give himself a goal to work for. One thing that Kotarou lacks in life is reasoning. He lacks the drive to do homework, spend quality time with his parents, he only spends time at the library and dance practice because he feels comfortable there. As soon as he finds a reason to do school work and be more efficient in life, you see Kotarou shine with his true colours, as you do with Akane.\\n\r\nThe big reason I like the characters so much is how it can pass for a legitimate story, as the characters are realistic with how they work around their problems. It's not supposed to be all happy moments, as the tv show outcome is how it would happen in real life is super different, but this show shows a strong sense of reality in many of the outcomes in the show, won't say too much to spoil.\\n\r\nHowever, one thing the show lacks imo is a proper supporting cast. I understand having the center point be around Kotarou and Akane, but you can try and include Kotarou's line of friends into the story as well and play some sort of role. It seems that the show declares them as outcasts, and only puts them in moments to where they think is enough to classify them as supporting cast, but generally they had no effect on the story. Akane's did, but Kotarou's group of friends play no general meaning other than to stand there as blank silhouettes with the basic generalization of \"supporting cast\"\\n\\n\r\nDue to the character development being different and each character having their sort of escape from reality that works into the plot are reasons that I admire the two main characters.\\n\r\nHowever, due to the lack equality for the supporting cast on Kotarou's side mainly it will bring the score down slightly.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nI generally enjoyed watching a good romance. The best one I\u2019ve seen so far out of 4 different ones. Even though there are moments where I question the show, there are more moments where I am in awe at how well a show can capture the emotions of a quiet relationship and working around their limits. Although the Art isn't the best and ruins some parts, there is the story that makes up for it that gives it a twist on reality driven events, having the plot revolve around the sense of reality as well and what the true meaning of \"love\" is. Love is like the same question as \"what is the meaning of life\". There are different ways people can answer that based on their experiences living and going through everything they do. This show talks about Love as a reason. A reason to change, a goal to grasp, and something to work for as long as you live. It gives you life knowing that you have achieved \"love\" with someone people question in the show as \"why him\". The show generally doesn't answer that question, but it leaves you to answer it. Love is something that just happens. The second they laid eyes on each other they start blushing and becoming shy to one another, already sharing a emotional connection on a psychological plane. Love at first sight is what the show generally demonstrates, but loyalty coming along with it, having no doubts and achieving goals as a couple to make yourself the best people you can possibly be by maintaining a relationship with each other. \\n\\n\r\nLove gives Life a meaning.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Rating 8/10\\n\r\nLooking at what truly makes the show shine I\u2019d give this a 9 or even a 10/10 for being an awesome and enjoyable romance. However, due to key details being left out and the art and sound not being too good my overall rating is\\n\r\n8/10\\n\r\nthanks for reading\\n",

Un anime que si les soy sincera, me encant\u00f3 al principio, aburri\u00f3, y finalmente termin\u00f3 por atraparme nuevamente.\r\nEs un anime que claramente no es el mejor, pero yo en este caso voy a hacer la review en un sentido diferente, yo voy a decir mi experiencia, lo que me provoc\u00f3 este anime y lo que sent\u00ed al verlo, no voy a meterme por caminos en los cuales me voy a perder como la animaci\u00f3n y detalles as\u00ed.\r\nComo les dije, viendo este anime estuve frentea tres fases que las voy a denominar as\u00ed: 1- La fase del descubrimiento. 2- La fase del aburrimiento. 3- La fase de la emoci\u00f3n.\\n\\n\r\n1- Esto me sucedi\u00f3 cuando comenc\u00e9 a ver el anime. Me result\u00f3 muy bonita su historia y como avanzaban los hechos, y adem\u00e1s, debido a que tengo la misma edad que los protagonistas, me sent\u00eda identificada con los sucesos que iban pasando.\\n\\n\r\nLa historia en el principio se centr\u00f3 m\u00e1s en mostrarnos como dos personas que casi no hablaban pueden volverse personas muy cercanas, y de como la tecnolog\u00eda est\u00e1 haciendo cambios en la sociedad, como les pasa a nuestros protagonistas, que hablan mucho por LINE, pero en la vida real no soy tan en\u00e9rgicos y c\u00f3micos como en LINE.\\n\\n\r\nA la primer fase la denomin\u00e9 descubrimiento, \u00bfPor qu\u00e9?\\n\r\nPorque en los primeros cap\u00edtulos el anime nos mostr\u00f3 como se iba a desarrollar esta historia. A mi me gust\u00f3, pero algo pas\u00f3 en la segunda fase que me hizo flaquear.\\n\\n\r\n2- Esta fase no sucedi\u00f3 porque quisiera, claramente. Fue algo que sucedi\u00f3 porque la trama se fue por un lado que medio me aburre, y tambi\u00e9n yo comet\u00ed algunos errores.\\n\\n\r\nA mi siempre me pasa, que antes de ver un cap\u00edtulo de anime, no puedo evitar ver los comentarios. Gran error. Nunca lo hagan. Primero, pod\u00e9s toparte con alg\u00fan spoiler, cosa que es bastante horrible. Adem\u00e1s, al fin y al cabo es tu culpa, puesto que si te aparece alg\u00fan spoiler de ese cap\u00edtulo en especial, esa persona no tiene la culpa, los comentarios est\u00e1n hechos para comentar sobre el cap\u00edtulo, t\u00fa fuiste el idiota que decidi\u00f3 verlos antes.\\n\r\nY lo segundo, que es lo que me pasa a m\u00ed, es que al ver de qu\u00e9 se trata el cap\u00edtulo, no me gustaba y terminaba dej\u00e1ndolo para otro momento, alargando y alargando el tiempo de espera.\\n\\n\r\nCon respecto a la trama, lo que no me gust\u00f3 es que se meti\u00f3 medio que en el mundo del clich\u00e9 rom\u00e1ntico. Una chica gusta del prota, y un chico de la prota, gran clich\u00e9 que sinceramente me tiene un poquito harta, porque ya sabemos c\u00f3mo termina. Por cierto, otro punto, serie un poquito mucho predecible.\\n\\n\r\n3- Finalmente, nos vamos a la etapa que m\u00e1s me hizo disfrutar del anime. Esta etapa, que contiene maso menos los \u00faltimos cap\u00edtulos, es claramente lo mejor. Disfrut\u00e9 como nunca. Me gust\u00f3 much\u00edsimo c\u00f3mo se fue desarrollando la historia, los protas parec\u00edan madurar conforme la historia pasaba, los sucesos de verdad eran emocionantes, se mostraron caras de los personajes que no hab\u00edamos visto, haci\u00e9ndolos m\u00e1s reales, y tambi\u00e9n, hab\u00edan muchas partes en las que lo hicieron lo m\u00e1s realista posible, haci\u00e9ndonos mas cercanos a los protas y su entorno. Sin duda alguna, esta etapa est\u00e1 llena de sorpresas.\\n\\n\r\nY para terminar, quiero dar un muy buen punto a favor: el final.\\n\r\nDespu\u00e9s de que termin\u00f3 el anime, mostraron los cr\u00e9ditos. Algo que me llam\u00f3 la atenci\u00f3n, es que hab\u00edan textos de LINE al final, como signo de que esto no terminaba ahi. Segu\u00ed vi\u00e9ndolo por mera curiosidad, y me encontr\u00e9 con que nos segu\u00edan mostrando como fue avanzando la historia de los personajes luego del final. Me gust\u00f3 mucho ese detalle del final, nada m\u00e1s que eso.\\n\\n\r\nRespecto a la banda sonora, me pareci\u00f3 bastante buena. Yo algo que tengo es que cuando una banda sonora de verdad me gusta, mis o\u00eddos en vez de escuchar las voces, pasan a la m\u00fasica, por eso me doy cuenta de que bandas sonoras valen la pena. En este caso, no escuch\u00e9 mucho, pero un par de veces pude o\u00edr melod\u00edas para chuparse los dedos.\\n\\n\r\nEso es todo, y aunque me tiren piedras, yo considero a Tsuki ga Kirei junto con Ballroom e Youkoso, mis animes favoritos del 2017.\\n",

            "content": "the story in this anime reminds me of my two friends whose story is almost the same as in Tsuki ga Kirei, maybe the difference is that my friend was already high school.\r\nI immediately contacted them, but unfortunately they did not have any relationship anymore. * lol\r\nback to the anime review of Tsuki ga Kirei, this anime has a simple story, simple character, simple storyline can be said quite often happen in anime and real life.\r\nbut in the anime we can share the early moments of falling in love very clearly.\r\nthe story begins nicely to bring together the two main characters with an unintentional element,as if following the fate of their relationship.\\n\r\ncontinuing with episodes in the middle of the story raises a problem that I do not think is too complicated to solve, or rather less harmful to the relationship between the two characters.\\n\r\nand the story ends with, hmm ... I do not really like the end of the story because I do not know the process with the story directly, just accelerated and toward the end of the story.\\n\r\nthe final process of the story just jumps. should proceed to season 2, because those with an LDR might invite interesting issues to solve.\\n\\n\r\nand also this parade scene is japanese culture? . I do not really understand the culture.\\n\r\nbut I think the parade scene is good, because the cultural activities are not displayed once, but told regularly from the process of training to the actual parade.",

            "content": "This anime is a great watch, for me it brought up a lot of feels from first love and how it affects your life to preparation for exams and graduation. \r\nArt is great and tends to improve towards the last episodes. Character design is also great and characters act naturally when faced with different life choices .\r\nHowever where the story lacks, is the time frame chosen for it. Had it been chosen at the end of hischool with graduation and university admission, it would have been more believable. Also it's a story of first love however it should have stopped before the end credits scene.The end credits scene should not have been added there, it makes the story less believable. Apart from this, it would have been a 10 in my book, factoring the above it's a 9. \\n\\n\r\nDefinitely recommended to watch for the feels depicted, you will definitely find a piece of yourself in this anime.",

            "content": "The very first anime in my entire list so far that managed to score a perfect 10 on all subject.\r\nThis anime starts in a very common setting. A school. The story revolves around two particular students which become the center of attraction for the story. The art is perfect for the set. The insert song, background music, OP, ED are a fitting match for the anime. I can go on and on about it but I'll cut it short\r\nSo, Tsuki ga Kirei. The perfect romance anime to ever exist. The story is heartwarming and sometimes viewer can relate to the MC. It's not overexaggerated oroverdramatic. There's no cliche character here. Everyone is like a new set of tropes detached from the rest of the tropes. It managed to pick the most overused setting in anime and turn that setting into a perfect love story. There's a mix of comedy and drama here and there to relax.\\n\\n\r\nLet me warn you beforehand!\\n\r\nDo not watch this if you're a pretty emotional person with a particular background depicted in the show. You'll break yourself in the process. Still, I recommend this if you like a true romance drama with a good story minus cliffhanger",

But what a surprise when I saw the innocence of Akane Mizuno's face upon seeing Kotarou Azumi. From there I got interested to continue on to the next episode.\r\nStarting from the story line, the song and especially the character of both of them are very plain and timid. Until now I am still watching this anime without boredom, even occasionally I wish I was Kotarou Mizuno figure who want to feel the direct love storyof both of them to have their own family.\\n\\n\r\nA great work of art.",
