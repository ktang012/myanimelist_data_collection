            "content": "When asked, a lot of people don't like idol anime or anything similar, or in other words, anime based on music and stuff. I'm one of these people. I don't usually watch idol anime, but I wanted to try this out because of the outstanding art that this anime offers.\r\nAt first I was really hesitant, even to the point where I removed it off my PTW list because I would feel embarrassed having watched something like this. Sure this anime might be targeted towards children rather than teens/adults, but it doesn't mean that teens/adults wouldn't enjoy this. This anime taught to me that hard workactually does pay off, that if you try your hardest, you will eventually arrive to your destination point. \\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of things I liked about this anime, but the thing I liked most was probably the art. Yes, I'm a very picky person when it comes to art, and this anime reached my expectations when it came to the art. All the characters were nicely designed and all of the 9 girls are cute. In other words, the art was what some people call it, flawless.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing I disliked about this anime was the fact that they were taking too long to prepare for the live shows and stuff like that. The producers should have shown the girls in action more (I don't literally mean in action, I meant that they should probably have shown more of their songs).\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of characters, all of them are easily likable, none of them are really that bland. There are 3 main characters in this anime, Honoka, who is seriously hyper and energetic, Umi who is very shy and was reluctant to become a school idol at first, and Kotori who is a very calm, and a little shy. \\n\\n\r\nWe have these 3 main characters make an school idol group in order to save the school from closing (because they aren't reaching the applicant quota). They name this school idol group 'Muse' (sorry I don't want to look all over the internet just for a greek character). Eventually they reach 9 members by around episode 6-9, forgot. That's basically it for the story since I don't want to spoil a lot.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is the second thing I enjoyed a lot in this anime. The opening was just straight up amazing, I almost watched it every episode. I don't usually watch endings because they're usually dull and boring, but I really loved the ending song this time, I ended up watching it every episode. The insert songs were amazing too, I ended up downloading that 'Dash' song too (it was that good :>).\\n\\n\r\nI could probably say that I felt embarrassed inside while watching the first few episodes due to this being my first idol anime, but eventually I got used to the feeling and I opened myself up to this anime. All in all I could say that I enjoyed this anime a lot for my first idol anime, and I would suggest this to anyone who is looking for an idol anime.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading :>\\n\r\n- Peten00b",

            "content": "Trashy Pandas \t\tLove Live! School Idol Project Review\t\t\tMay 22, 2014\r\n*THIS ONLY CONTAINS THE FIRST SEASON I WILL EVENTUALLY GET AROUND TO WRITING THE REVIEW FOR THE ENTIRE SERIES BUT SCHOOL IS TAKING UP ALL OF MY TIME*\r\n\u201cDatte kanosei kanjitanda. Sou da susume. Kokai shitaku nai me no mae ni bokura no michi ga aru.\u201d\r\n\u201cI feel we have a chance. Yes let's push forward. I don't want to regret it later. Our future lies right ahead.\u201d from the song Susume by Muse. \r\n\tHope. Desires. Goals. Perseverance. Friendship. Love. Music. The girls of the school idol group Muse share all of these wonderful things as they giveit their all to be a part of the most popular event for high school idol groups: Love Live. The nine girls strive to save their school from closing by trying to attract perspective students through the formation of a school idol group that, they hope, will one day be a part of Love Live. Honoka Kousaka leads her group of eight other cute, talented high school friends towards Love Live. The anime Love Live! School Idol Project has become my #1 favorite anime because of the wonderful, loveable, and memorable characters, the outstanding animation style, and, most importantly, the best, most addictive, and energetic soundtrack, which all culminate into one amazing story of friendship, love, hope, and music. \\n\\n\r\nI Plot\\n\r\n\tThe plot for Love Live! Is very straight forward, easy to follow, and enjoyable. The story goes as anyone would expect after watching the first episode: the main character and her friends work to save their school from closing by trying to attract new students by gaining popularity through the formation of a school idol group which becomes known as \u201cMuse\u201d. This formula is followed for most of the story, however there are several complications that are not expected and some twists. I'm not going to spoil it, even though this is a review. While being not very complex, the plot forms a solid foundation for the anime, is consistently present, and keeps the story progressing. There is not much else to say without spoiling the twists and turns. The plot fits well and proves fairly interesting. \\n\\n\r\nII Romance?\\n\r\n\tThere are no \u201cofficial\u201d romances in Love Live!, however, there are subtle and clear hints at possible relationships that could be. My favorite of the possible romances is Honoka x Maki. Honoka is the energetic, lively leader of Muse while Maki is very level-headed and reserved. I love the contrast that would make their relationship work like a charm. Other than this, there are no relationships to expand on, you just get enjoyment from shipping the girls together. \\n\\n\r\nIII Theme\\n\r\n\tThe main theme of Love Live! Is never give up despite how impossible the road ahead may seem and always remember that your friends are there with you every step of the way. Friends are there to stick with you through thick and thin, good and bad weather, shit storms and double rainbows. Also, be aware of your friends and their feelings. Another key part of the theme is to never give up on your dreams. No matter how many setbacks and roadblocks are in the way, the prize at the end of the road is worth the experiences that are encompassed by the journey. The theme is not much more complex than this. \\n\\n\r\nIV Animation and Art Style\\n\r\n\tThe animation for Love Live! Is mind-blowingly amazing. For the most part, the animation and art is in 2D, but when the girls put on their performances, the animation switches over to 3D character models for exciting, energetic dance routines. Starting with the 2D aspect, the girls have extremely cute, distinguishing physical appearances. I love the designs for the girls' eyes; the eyes are realistically proportioned and detailed. The girls' bodies are realistic and resemble what actual high school girls would look like, i.e. they don't have obnoxiously large breasts and overly exaggerated sexual features except Nozomi, who has large breasts but not to the point that it's the only thing the viewer cares about or notices. I love that the girls aren't sexualized like in a lot of anime such as Sekirei or High School DxD; I feel the anime would have been totally different if that were the case. As for the surroundings and environment, it's pretty standard. NOW, for the 3D animation. Wow, wow, this hits it out of the ballpark: 3D song and dance routines that will make you sit in awe while watching these amazingly cute girls have the time of their lives. I wish that there were a lot more of these, but I highly doubt the animation budget could have incorporated them. Still, I digress, the 3D animation makes a massive impact on the viewers and is just spectacular. \\n\\n\r\nV Characters\\n\r\n\tThe characters in Love Live! Are some of  my favorite characters of all time because of how unique, well designed, and beautiful they are. Honoka Kousaka, the protagonist, is an extremely lively, spontaneous, and strong willed girl who will do anything to achieve her dreams. Honoka forms Muse with her friends, Umi and Kotori before reaching out to get more girls to help with reaching their goal. Honoka is so lovable; she is so determined to do everything she can to keep her school from being closed down. There isn't anything bad to say about her.  Umi Sonoda, one of Honoka's best friends from childhood, is a very calm, sensible, and serious girl who does archery at the high school while being a part of Muse. Umi is very talented with poetry and has superb writing skills; she writes mostly all of the lyrics for Muse's songs. Umi is just as determined as Honoka, but a lot more forceful when it comes to accomplishing things. She is a very lovable and is attractive in as a strong female character. Kotori Minami, who is my favorite character and my #1 waifu, is probably  THE most  adorable character I've ever seen. I love her hairstyle; it's a champagne blonde color, sort of more ash colored (I don't know how to adequately describe the various shades of hair color). The way she wears it is straight down in the back with a shoulder length pony tail that is combined into a folding thing. I don't know how to describe it, but it's absolutely adorable (look it up on google images). Kotori is a very shy girl who loves her friends, and the members of Muse, more than anything. The other members of Muse are Eri Ayase, Nico Yazawa, Nozomi Tojo, Maki Nishikino, Hanayo Koizumi, and Rin Hoshizora. Eri is the leader of the high school's student council; she was apposed to the idea of Muse, but ended up joining and loving the experience. Eri is very kind, hardworking, earnest, and the best dancer in Muse. Nico Yazawa was the head of the School Idol Research Club at the school, who had previously been a part of the school's former  idol group. She is extremely passionate about the group's success and wants more than anything for Muse to be a part of Love Live. She is a very tsundere-esque character but has a very sweet side that makes up for the annoying side. Nozomi Tojo is the manipulative student council vice president who indirectly helps Honoka form Muse. Nozomi also gives Muse it's name. Nozomi is very rational and the most caring member of the group; she sees deep into the other characters' feelings and does whatever she can to help them out. But she loves boobs, a lot... she grabs the other characters' breasts all the time.  Maki, is the beautiful girl with dark red hair whose musical talent exceeds anything that I could ever hope to do. She is an amazing composer and does most of the work to set Umi's lyrics to a dynamic, lively tune. Similar to Umi, she is very reserved and has a lot of trouble being open with the other girls of Muse. Maki is a genius whose family wants her to become a medical doctor and inherit the family's hospital. Hanayo Koizumi is one of the three first years who is Muse's biggest fan before she joins the group. She is the most shy girl of them all who share's Nico's obsession with school idols and Love Live. Hanayo has a very kind heart, but I don't think she has a whole lot of depth from what I remember. Rin Hoshizora is the last first year and Hanayo's best friend from their childhood. Rin has the same liveliness as Honoka and has that cat-like cuteness that some anime characters have: the cute cat smile, high pitched and playful voice. Again she doesn't have a ton of depth but I still love her character as much as all of the others'. \\n\\n\r\nVI Music\\n\r\n\tThe soundtrack for Love Live! Is just... I... I don't have a large enough, or refined enough vocabulary to do the music justice. Spirited, lively, energetic, peppy, bubbly, and beautiful is the best way for me to explain the music. I'm not a musical expert, I play bass guitar a little bit, and I love the music. The girls have the most gorgeous, beautiful, resonant voices that I've ever heard and I can't get enough of hearing all nine of these adorable girls sing. Each song is so full of energy that I want to start dancing with them, even though I'm a guy. On another note, I mainly listen to heavy metal, thrash metal, metalcore, hard rock, and classic rock but I love Muse's songs just as much as I love AC/DC, Metallica, Iron Maiden, Megadeth, Avenged Sevenfold, and Disturbed. If that doesn't say something about how amazing these girls are, then I don't know what does. The lyrics aren't as shallow as I thought they would be. The lyrics aren't very deep at the same time, but it's not easy to have deep lyrics for a peppy school idol group and keep the songs and performance entertaining and lively, now is it. I regret my lack of musical expertise and knowledge of musical jargon; I can't give Muse's musical talent the justice it deserves, so please go and check out the songs available on YouTube or watch the anime yourself so you can experience this amazing work of art. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\n\tI give Love Live! School Idol Project an 11/10 for its beyond outstanding ability to spread cheerfulness, the amazing and lovable characters, the jaw dropping animation sequences and the spectacular music. Love Live! Receives the Pandas Seal of Approval, a gold medal, and the #1 spot on my top ten favorite anime list. I would highly recommend this to anyone, of any age, because of how open it is to everyone. The second season is currently airing and episode 8 is scheduled to be released within the upcoming week.",

            "content": "\"Love Live! School Idol Project\", I have never fully watched any idol series before, so this one was my first, and I ended up enjoying it a lot. I've tried to watch IdolM@ster when it first aired, but I just couldn't get into it. I watched Love Live after it was finished airing. I honestly don't know why I decided to watch Love Live, but I'm so glad I did.\r\nStory\r\nThere was a clear story, which was good. School is gonna get shut down if they don't get enough students, Honoka (main character) decides to become school idols to stop the school from closing. The storywas simple, and I didn't have any problems with the pacing. Throughout the show, they include showing what the characters need to endure to become idols which include stamina, vocal, and dance training. I thought that this was a nice toutch to include and helped with character development quite well\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation\\n\r\nI liked the overall art style, which fit the mood of this series, it was bright and colorful. But the one thing that I didn't like was the CG's. Luckily, they were only used during the insert songs and in the opening. They didn't use CG's for the whole song either, it switched between several times, sometimes, the CG wasn't too noticeable, which is why I didn't mind it too much. The animation looked smooth and was very well executed. No complaints about animation. I loved the choreography during the songs, sometimes, I had to rewatch one of the performances twice. Once to focus on the song, and another to look at the choreography.\\n\\n\r\nSound/Music\\n\r\nBeing an idol anime, I guess I kinda expected good music. I am glad to say that I was not disappointed. All of the songs were catchy, memorable and fit the situation very well. Even the background music stood out to me (in a good way). It always fit with the events that happened and set the tone of whats gonna happen. The opening song was amazing, I never skipped it, not a single time. The ending song was the same, never wanted to skip it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nEach character had a very different personality and were all likeable in their own way. There weren't any characters that I hated. I found that I could summarize the personalities of the characters in just a few words, which isn't necessarily bad. The characters had a very human like mindset in my opinion, which enhanced the drama scenes in the show.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\nI really liked this anime and am glad that I gave it a go. I have never fully watched an idol anime before this one. When I was watching, I was completely immersed in the show. I never felt bored or wanted to skip over a scene during the show. The music was amazing, I cannot stress that enough. If you haven't watched this, I highly recommend that you give it a shot.",

            "content": "So, you want to become a superstar? \r\nIt's not easy. In fact, it takes more than just skill. It takes the will, determination, support, technique, integrity, and a little bit of luck to reach success. In fact, reaching that point of success is especially hard when there's competition. Among other things, being an idol also means to shine and make yourself a name in the industry. You have to embrace what you do and no matter what, always aim for success. \r\nAt least, that's what the girls at Otonokizaka High School wishes to do...\r\nAlright, this series known as Love Live! School Idol Project is actuallyan anime project co-produced with the music company Lantis Co., Ltd and studio Sunrise being involved. Not many people may know of the franchise but it already has achieved success in other fields of music CDS. Well, success doesn't come easy like I mentioned before and in this series, it definitely is something that's hard to achieve. \\n\\n\r\nAt first I was skeptical whether to check out this series or not. I mean, there are so many idol themed series already in the anime industry. Hell, even this Winter season of 2013, there is not one (Akb4OO8 Next Stage) but two (Akitasu) ongoing series involving music and idols. In fact, I sometimes get bored of watching this stuff because initially, I thought the show would just be about cute girls doing cute things. I wasn't too wrong either especially with our main female protagonist, Honoka Kosaka. \\n\\n\r\nJust look at her, she's a cute little button with a cute little bang on the side of her head along with that bubbly personality.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, beyond that outer image is a girl who is determined to prevent the shutdown of her beloved school. How? Form an idol group of course! But that's a lot easier said than done in reality. The series takes this idea and transform it into a more of a slice-of-life story in the beginning. At first, there's Honoka. Then later comes the rest of the characters, or rather girls who all becomes associated with the group. Oh and the group is called Muse represented by the \"\u03bc's\" symbol. Obviously, it's a reflection of what the group stands for \u2013 a music ensemble of girls who wishes to show the world who they are and make a name for themselves while at the same time to prevent the destruction of their beloved school.\\n\\n\r\nThus, their journey begins...\\n\\n\r\nThe initial episodes (first half of the series) makes prominent highlights of some of the other girls in the series. Among these girls, they all have different personalities. There's the timid girl with the stage freight (Umi Sonoda), the cool chick (Nozomi), the tomboy (Rin Hoshizora), the cold heart (Eli), the gentle girl (Kotori Minami), and the childish (Niko Yazawa). Of course, I'm not naming all the characters here but you get the idea. From the initial premise of becoming superstars, these girls come together. However, I find the first of the episodes in this series to be dull and not done right. In fact, I find most of the girls' backgrounds to be stale and lacks any real characterization besides who they are. Perhaps the lack of a general background with the girls is the weakness here but regardless, the first half of the series is a bit mediocre in my book. Well, thanks to Niko, I did have some fun and enjoyed part of her performance. NIKO-NIKO smile~\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the series becomes more lively later on especially with Honoka. I will say right now that her mood brightens this series quite a bit and can easily bring a smile to a viewer's eyes. If you're having a bad day, just watch her and that cloud of grayness will brighten. That's probably a weak analogy but her enthusiasm is what unites the group she works so hard to create. In fact, as the unanimous leader of the group, it is up to Honoka to save the school and make a name for themselves with the face of music. Perhaps, I feel she tries too hard though. I mean, in one episode, she particularly puts her own life at risk. It's how hard she tries to bring their ranks together especially when going up against competition. That' s the thing too because when you become a superstar, expect media attention and rivals heading your way. It's a tough, tough world Honoka-chan.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of the series remains weak but simple. It's about a group of girls coming together united as a music group to bring media attention. By becoming idols/superstars, they can spread their names and hopefully with what they can achieve will save their school. As simple as it is though, it is VERY easy to guess who will join Muse. It's not even foreshadowing but rather given directly with the opening song and poster. The series also doesn't avoid the typical \"beach episode\" that seemingly becomes one of those relaxing break. Furthermore, the seemingly focus on the idols themselves rather than what they hope to achieve becomes a backstabber in my opinion to the initial premise. Also, it seems that the competition isn't as intense as it originally looked. \\n\\n\r\nDespite this though, I find the series to be a fun and entertaining watch with a cherry atmosphere. It's nice to see the girls tries so hard on a profession that is extremely difficult to make a name for. But what they're doing it for is not only for themselves but to save their beloved school. Now that my friends is what I call good-hearted. The performance themselves are also quite real and done well. In fact, some of the songs played in many of the episodes has that idol-like feeling. With those cute outfits, personalities, and outfits, these girls really do have what it takes. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of visuals, Sunrise does them. And hey, who knew, they actually pulled a nice one out of their hats this time. From the outfits, character designs, and the way the girls dances, the visuals almost feel like they are coming to life at many occasions. I find this to be quite pleasing and interactive to watch as opposed to some CGI movements or forced movements. No, it's natural and the girls are putting on a live show. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack, music, and voice acting is perhaps the most prominent feature of this series. After all, music is the main feature and premise of Love Live! The sound director, Yukio Nagasaki puts effort through and it's easy to hear and visualize what it's there. Of course, the performance that I mentioned before are also done beautifully. It looks natural, realistic, and the girls have fun doing it. At some occasions, viewers may wish they were right there with them on the stage. Then opening song, \"Bokura wa Ima no Naka de\" by \u03bc's is performed by the idol group themselves and shows to the audience that they're serious about what they do. The many ED songs brings together a collage of various fun tunes featuring different mood settings. It's beautiful~\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this underrated series is worth some time to invest into. In my opinion, this show is charming and so is Muse. Although its initial episodes were like a chore to watch, it later makes it up with the enthusiasm of the group along with the all cheerful Honoka-chan. It's also fun to watch the girls perform and hope that they succeed especially when they see some results on what they worked so hard for. Yup, they are aiming for success but at the same time having fun while doing it. Well, I hope you have fun while you relax, sit back, and enjoy what Muse do their best:\\n\\n\r\nEntertain you.",

            "content": "Unless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, you\u2019ve probably taken note of the rising popularity and plethora of idol related anime in the last few years. Any time I dare venture out to any anime convention that just so happens to be taking place within my proximity, I\u2019m bound to be met with an onslaught of idol related merchandise from body pillows, those strange mouse pads that also have a pair of breasts on them, figures, CDs and even several cosplayers too \u2013 it\u2019s inescapable!

They feature an ensemble of cute girls, of various body types, whether that be the small loli (remember to tell the FBI that she is just a drawing when they come knocking down your door!) all the way to the plump and voluptuous, all the while having distinct personality types to appeal to every demographic of anime fan imaginable. Combine that with the fact that the girls are often made to wear skimpy and risqu\u00e9 outfits with incredibly small miniskirts, and sing generic, catchy pop-songs with their cute mannerisms, makes for a cultural phenomenon! Out of all the various idol anime out there, easily the most prolific and popular is Love Live; a franchise so popular over in Japan that in 2016 it was the highest grossing media franchise of that year, passing One Piece! (Damn, that\u2019s a lot of scantily clad body pillows sold!) Over the last few days, me and a couple of other reviewer friendos decided to watch the entire series (for the most part anyway) all together, and while it was a very enjoyable experience to do so, even if we spent most of the time making fun of the show, I seem to have been left with rather severe PTSD, so much so, that every time I go to close my eyes to sleep at night, visions of each of the girls as they smile and dance appear in front of me. At first, it\u2019s tranquil; calm, but as time moves along the girls become fierce and terrifying, laughing manically as I am trapped in this existential horrific nightmare in which even my own screams of pain and anguish cannot awaken me from the horrors that lay before me. I desperately want to run, to run from the visions, but I\u2019m stuck; frozen in place as the idols slowly consume me and every fibre of my being\u2026\\n\\n\r\nAnywho, with that all said and done, and instead of contacting my closest therapist immediately, let\u2019s form our own idol group, dress up in some revealing clothes whilst dancing and singing on stage, and dive into the world of Love Live!\\n\\n\r\nOtonokizaku High School is on the verge of closing, due a lack of students wanting to partake in studies there, and is set to shut down after the current first year students graduate. As such, our main protagonist, Honoka, in an attempt to prevent the school closing down at all costs, decides to create an idol group, as a way to attract new students into attending said school, thus preventing it from its inevitable closure. The rest of the series sees Honoka recruit new members, as they all practice harder and harder to become great idols, intermixed with a touch of drama here and there. At the very least, Love Live\u2019s set-up allows for some semblance of narrative stakes as the failure of the newly formed idol group, by the name of Muse, will bring an end to the school (even though we know as an audience from the get-go that the characters will succeed since there is nothing presented in the narrative that would suggest otherwise) and it also provides some kind of motivation and drive for the characters in the story. My main criticism of Love Live\u2019s narrative is just how incredibly predictable and safe the entire journey is. It\u2019s the most standard narrative structure one could possibly expect to see, and has been done so many times in so many other shows, that I can guarantee you that you would be able to identify each story beat and event that transpires in the show just by simply reading the plot synopsis presented on MAL. It genuinely feels like that whoever was writing the show, was simply ticking boxes off of things to include within the show. A hyper and energetic girl with good intentions who ropes everyone in and inspires them to try their hardest? TICK. An obligatory beach episode which is used for the purpose of training and seeing each of the girls in skimpy bathing suits? TICK. Drama that is introduced late into the narrative and is used more so to try and make the show seem more emotional than it is, whilst trying to manipulate the audience into feeling something for the characters, which will be ultimately resolved by the final episode leaving in a happy conclusion? TICK. As such, the narrative of Love Live feels tiering; a chore to sit through, as in my head I could easily map out the series and each one of the events that would transpire. It feels less like a journey you embark on with these girls as they try to save their school, and more so like a lecture in which you already know all the content the lecturer is going to go over, and you\u2019re just listing them off in your head, waiting for them to get to the next point.\\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned before, the show does have its share of drama, which I imagine was implemented into the narrative as a way to spice things up; to try and make things interesting, but it just comes across more so forced and trite than anything else, and the juxtaposition between the light-hearted hijinks an episode before, and scenes where everyone is yelling and fighting comes across as so damn jarring! Again, just like the complaints I talked about above about the narrative\u2019s predictability, the drama in the show is foreshadowed in such a way that ignores the very notion of subtlety. After both Umi, Honoka\u2019s friend, and Honoka\u2019s little sister warn her not to overwork herself as she may fall ill, she then decides to go running in the pouring rain like an idiot, develops a fever, and ends up ruining everybody\u2019s hard work as a result. The show expects me to feel sorry for Honoka, since the very reason as to why she developed this fever was because she was working so hard to prevent the school from closing down, but I simply can\u2019t, as the character itself isn\u2019t strong enough to illicit such emotions in me, especially since it\u2019s so typical of these types of shows to go down this route that it leaves no impact on me! There\u2019s even a scene in the show where the drama reaches a point in which Honoka gets bitch-slapped into the Shadow Realm after proclaiming her leaving of the group, whereupon I promptly laughed my ass off for a good ten minutes because I\u2019m an immature dumbass. But, this disconnect from what the show expects me to feel, that is, emotional and probably shock from seeing one of the girls resort to physical violence towards her friend, against what I felt, that is, laughter at a moment where it obviously wasn\u2019t warranted is the reason why I feel nothing for any of the drama they try and throw in the show, and a lot of that has to do with the fact that the characters are simply not strong enough to carry it. There\u2019s just nothing really to sink your teeth into in this show in regards to the story, and, despite what some people may tell you, such as the entire show being inside one of the character\u2019s heads (which would actually be kind of interesting as an idea now that I think about it) there\u2019s nothing really of any substantial merit here (then again, the person who told me that has Eli as his favourite girl, so therefore his claim lacks any weight automatically).\\n\\n\r\nNow, I\u2019ve complained a fair bit about the narrative and why it feels so tiresome and dull, but this mode of storytelling is not necessarily a game breaker for me. I can forgive an anime in regards to its lack of overall narrative, as long as the characters, and the interactions between them are good; it\u2019s the main reason why I liked Azumanga Diaoh after all. In that show, the narrative is simply about a bunch of high school girls whom progress through three years of high school, with them eventually graduating at the end, but the characters are all very likeable, to the point in which we grow attached to them as actual people, and the comedy in the show is strong enough to carry the entire experience. For me, the most important thing in most cases are the characters, since they hold the key to whether or not I care about anything the show prevents me with, and I think if the characters in Love Live were stronger, I could be more forgiving of the narrative and the whole show at large.\\n\\n\r\nMuch like in regards to the story, it felt like the writer constructed the characters in the most safe and predictable way possible, with two exceptions however. I\u2019ve already somewhat alluded to Honoka\u2019s character earlier in the review; she is the girl whom has the most energy, and acts as the driving force for pushing the story forward with her optimistic outlook to any situation and is the one that gathers everyone together, acting as the inspiration for the group through her hardworking attitude. She is not necessarily a bad character, just one that is not that interesting as a whole. As previously mentioned, she does run into some drama near the end of the series, but the small amount of development she embarks on, and character arc in general is still nothing remarkable as a whole. Umi, along with Kotori are best friends with Honoka and we see little snips of their past as children, which gives their characters a little more depth, although, and, again, is nothing to remarkable. They more so play the voice of rationality to Honoka in the series, with Umi being the shy and reserved type, but ultimately firm when the time calls, and Kotori\u2026just being an airhead I guess. Whilst in the latter part of the series, she has to make a decision regarding her future, that being whether to move to America to study costume design, or to stay being a worthless school idol, which then cultivates in some more of that lovely, forced D R A M A that I adore, it feels inconsequential in the long run, since it\u2019s pretty obvious that she will decide to stay with her friends since shows like this have practically programmed me to think as such. \\n\\n\r\nHanoyo and Rin add very little to the overall show and to be perfectly honest, I kind of forgot they were even there half the time. Rin joins the idol group just because Hanoyo does, and while Hanoyo\u2019s reasoning for joining, that being because she wants to grow in confidence is a fine motivation to have, it\u2019s barely developed or explored. Maki serves somewhat more to the overall story, as she can actually play the piano and sing rather well, which is then used for writing music for the group, and her Tsundere-esque personality can actually be kind of cute sometimes. Eli has somewhat more of a backstory than the rest of the girls, being that she was actually a ballet dancer in the past, which is then used to help the rest of the group and Noizoimi is one of the better characters, being as she has the most voluptuous body, and sexually harasses the other girls by grabbing their tits (if that\u2019s not a well crafted character, then I don\u2019t know what is). Nozomi takes on more of a mother role in the series, often dishing out random nuggets of wisdom to the girls whenever they\u2019re in need of some, and that\u2019s it as a whole. The characters in Love Live, for the most part, are extremely weak and cookie-cutter, so much so, that I\u2019m struggling to even find anything to say about them. The only fun character in the entire show is Nico, and, yes, I understand at this point she is one giant meme, but she is the only character who has some semblance of a personality. She is an aspiring wannabe ideal, constantly switching between her idol persona, that being the adorably sweet Nico, with the catchphrase \u201cNICO NICO NII!!\u201d which me and everyone repeated so much during our watch that my PTSD is triggered every time I hear it. She\u2019s like an antagonist in a way; the various things she does to try and prove that she is better than everyone else at various idol related things always blows up in her face, leading to some of the more entertaining aspects of the show (I also like to imagine to myself that Nico is a trap; a thought that brings me nothing but happiness).\\n\\n\r\nThe characters and their interactions are just fine as a whole. There are times when the chemistry between them does work, most strongest being during the beach episode I made fun of earlier since the girls are just messing around with each other (and Nico gets hit right in the goddam face with a beach ball so that\u2019s always a plus), leading into some genuinely charming and funny scenes, particularly thanks to Nico as I just mentioned before, but the show really needed a stronger cast of characters to really pull itself together. That\u2019s not to say that the entire show is without merit however. There were some scenes that I felt were kinda alright, such as in episode three, when, after the girls put all their efforts into practising for their first idol performance, and when the curtains go up to perform, they are greeted with only a few people rather than the full room like they were expecting, but despite that, they perform on anyway. Some of the facial expressions can also be pretty funny and charming too, such as when we\u2019re first introduced to Maki after she finishes playing her song, she looks over at the door to see Honoka clapping profusely, all the while being cross-eyed; it\u2019s a shot that never fails to make me laugh just because of how stupid it looks. As a whole, Love Live is just really bland and nothing of that much interest really happens as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation, it\u2019s overall pretty solid, with each girl appearing to be pretty damn cute with rather thicc thighs. I only mention the latter part due to the fact that the show has a tendency to have low camera angles, perfectly emphasising their thighs and butts (hey, I\u2019m not a pervert for noticing this stuff, it\u2019s the SHOWS fault for storyboarding it as such!) It does utilise CGI however during the performances scenes, which, to be perfectly fair, actually looks pretty good for CGI standards, but my main criticism is that they cut constantly between the CGI models and close-ups of with the traditional animation, and as a result, it ends up coming across as jarring; breaking the flow of both the dancing and my immersion. The music, as expected of a show all about music does the job, although I wouldn\u2019t call it anything great as a whole. It\u2019s generic, catchy pop that will forget about by the time the next generic, catchy pop songs comes on. Probably the only track that I really liked was Start; dash, mainly because some twat kept singing it during the Discord chat \u2013 what a strange guy that was\u2026\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion Love Live is just an incredibly bland show, and, despite a few moments here and there, is mostly devoid of anything of any substantial merit. I admit that I did enjoy myself whilst watching the show, but much of that enjoyment was indicative of watching it with everyone else. I\u2019m sure if I watched this by myself, as I did with the last three episodes, I would be bored to tears! And this is coming from someone who typically enjoys cute girls doing cute things types of shows, but Love Live\u2019s characters are just simply not strong enough, nor are their character interactions fun enough to hold the entire show together and becomes more so a chore to watch than anything else. I think now would be a good time to clarify that I do not begrudge anyone for enjoying this show, as the tone of this review may suggest otherwise, and, if anything, I\u2019m envious. Envious of the fact that you could find so much enjoyment in something I found to be bland at best; envious that you can genuinely get excited whenever the girls begin any of their performances. As it stands, Love Live\u2019s popularity confuses me, and I understand that I am critiquing an entire franchise with this statement consisting of a second season (which I\u2019ve been told is much better than this) a movie, as well a spin-off series that also has its own sequel, but as an opening to the entire franchise, it\u2019s incredibly weak, and doesn\u2019t inspire much desire to go off and watch the rest of the series. At best Love Live is incredibly mediocre; at worst it gave me aids. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "\u201cYou can\u2019t fool television viewers with dancing girls and flashing lights\u201d - Bob Barker\r\nIf there\u2019s any pop culture entity that can dispute Mr. Barker\u2019s claim, it is the idol genre. Prizing style over substance, flair over functionality, and pizazz over practicality, titles within the idol genre have discovered success time after time by appealing to its fanbase more than anything else. Unfulfilled character arcs, glacial pacing, stale voice acting, and even gaping plot holes can all be negated by the lavish concerts and energetic score from your standard idol anime. That\u2019s not to mention the miracles that a moe pop idol can conjure; there arefew tactics with greater financial success than inserting as many cute anime chicks into your show as possible. The idol genre has proven again and again that you really can fool viewers with dancing girls and flashing lights.\\n\\n\r\nIt is in this genre that Love Live has established a name for itself. Produced by Sunrise (Cowboy Bebop, Code Geass), Love Live (or \u201cLL\u201d for short) has developed into the biggest and brightest star of the idol genre, its massive fan base and overwhelming merchandise serving as major influences for its fame. Love Live is widely considered to be the greatest anime of its particular category, if not necessarily a critical darling. However, Love Live\u2019s lofty status raises a few interesting conundrums: if titles within the idol genre are, by and large, bereft of depth and meaning, then how is one supposed to properly determine which is the greatest? Why should Love Love be considered the ideal representative of the idol genre? Do Love Live\u2019s characters display more elaborate dances than that of Aikatsu? Does LL possess a greater sense of humor than The Idolmaster? I figured that actually watching Love Live would answer my questions so that\u2019s what I did. To be perfectly honest, I harbored a few misgivings about Love Live, mainly that it's nothing more than meme fodder. However, the optimist in me believed that Love Live would be far more than that. With its charming story, LL would not only soothe my heart but inspire me to espouse its virtues as well.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Love Live didn\u2019t exactly confirm my worst fears, it is hardly a series that I\u2019d recommend. My opposition to LL doesn\u2019t stem from hatred or disappointment; rather, it is generated from the show\u2019s lackluster execution of its most basic requirements. I\u2019m more than willing to condone a mishap or two in the visual department but a grocery list of logical fallacies, one after the other, is something else entirely. For example, your show might have a problem when your story struggles to formulate a raison d'etre. Love Live is focused on three friends (Honoka, Umi, and Kotori) that desire to prevent their school from closing down but, beyond their adoration for it, they never clarify why they want to save it. If our protagonists are unaware of their cause for concern, why should I be invested in what they\u2019re doing? Anywho, the trio agree that forming a school idol group is the best course of action (because why should you start donations and petitions when you can sing for a great cause?) but first they have to be approved by Eli Ayase, the Student Council President that\u2019s overly harsh towards our aspiring heroines.\\n\\n\r\nWill our main trio find a concrete purpose for saving their school?\\n\r\nWill Ayase change her dastardly ways?\\n\r\nWill Love Live start caring about itself?\\n\\n\r\nThese questions will be answered right after Love Live exposes you to the umpteenth shot of Honoka\u2019s butt.\\n\\n\r\nAt its core, Love Live is a show that panders like no show has ever pandered before. Not only is there an obligatory beach/swimsuit episode but there\u2019s also the rampant fanservice (especially early on), as well as an unbearable \u201cchest grab\u201d gag (it has to be seen to be believed). Couple that with Love Live\u2019s excessive moe aesthetic (the sparkly eyes, the constant blushing, and the unnatural wiggling/squirming) and top it all off with the bizarre scene in episode 11 where a friend of Honoka\u2019s rubs her head and scratches her chin like Honoka is some sort of dog. What you\u2019ll get is one phenomenal crowd-pleaser of a show, a show that prefers to satisfy fetishes rather than concern itself with storytelling. The flimsily constructed plot accomplishes little beyond serving as an elaborate excuse to showcase the cuteness of Love Live\u2019s characters; the cast is nothing but a hodgepodge of stereotypes. Outside of Honoka, Umi, Kotori, and Ayase, there\u2019s the athletic one (Rin and her \u201cnya\u201ds), the intense rival (Nico and her ridiculous poses), the shy one (Hanayo and her idol obsession), the tsundere (Maki)..... and Nozomi, the Student Council Vice President that perpetrates the aforementioned \u201cchest grab\u201d gag (I\u2019ve never seen a VP constantly undermine the President quite like Nozomi does in LL).\\n\\n\r\nIt will be of little surprise to you when I say that most of Love Live\u2019s characters are inessential. Ayase and Kotori, however, are crucial to a certain extent but it\u2019s Honoka and Umi that are the true outliers. Honoka is Love Live\u2019s protagonist, a spontaneous do-gooder cut from the cloth of the spunky girl trope. What truly defines Honoka as a character are her over-the-top speeches (those bits of dialogue are downright painful in the amount of vapid positivity they exude) and her overwhelming ego (we\u2019ll get to that later). Umi, on the other hand, is Honoka\u2019s foil; she\u2019s literally the only LL character with common sense, a realistic approach, and a complex personality. As Honoka\u2019s best friend, Umi desires to aid her friend in achieving her dream but is, at first, adamantly against Honoka\u2019s idea of an idol group because Umi rightfully doubts the effort that Honoka applied to it. Over time, Umi softens her stance on Honoka\u2019s idea and of idol groups on general, even to the point where she valiantly defends the existence of idols in a climatic scene. On a surface level, Umi appears to be the stereotypical \u201cquiet one\u201d, that and nothing more, but she quickly endears herself as she wages war against her anxiety, her timidity, and the mob mentality that is an all-encompassing presence in Love Live.\\n\\n\r\nHonoka lords over Love Live with an iron fist; there isn\u2019t a single character in any medium, animated or not, that wields as much creative control as Honoka. If there\u2019s one thing that you simply must know about Love Live, it\u2019s that this show is gravitated entirely towards what Honoka desires and anyone that deviates from it is severely punished. Honoka advertises her viewpoints as essential for success and for the betterment of others but it\u2019s obvious that she's only massaging her ego. For example, Umi wants to perform in concerts with a knee-length skirt (for several logical reasons) and, while any true friend would respect Umi\u2019s wishes, Honoka, with Kotori\u2019s help, secretly created skirts of shorter length. When Umi discovers this act of treachery, she's understandably upset but Love Live more or less remains loyal to Honoka\u2019s scheme. It\u2019s all very sickening; Honoka is this lionized ringleader of debauchery and deceit with the overarching narrative and Kotori as her partners in crime (Kotori is the ideal yes-man for Honoka; she possesses very, very few individual thoughts or opinions, existing only to blindly support Honoka). The in-universe benefits that Honoka receives from LL are simply absurd; she\u2019s hailed as the idol group\u2019s leader despite not proving herself as one, she\u2019s praised for her unreasonable badgering of potential members, and her excessive pettiness is rarely admonished. The moments where Honoka is called out on her BS, like Ayase pointing out her arrogance or Nico questioning Honoka\u2019s leadership, are so, so refreshing but they are few and far between. Is it too much to expect LL to treat its characters with fairness and rationality?\\n\\n\r\nBuried deep within Love Live\u2019s framework, beneath Honoka\u2019s ego trip, beneath the gratuitous pandering, beneath the shallow characterization, is a redeemable project. It\u2019s LL\u2019s soundtrack that possesses most of this show's promise; soothing and refined, the OST is stunning in its versatility. Not only does Love Live\u2019s score contain acoustic guitar songs and piano solos but there are also big band pieces as well. Although LL tends to utilize the same five or six songs over and over, the music is still a joy to listen to. However, when you\u2019re not enchanted by Love Live\u2019s score, you're left in awe by the artificiality of it all. Like a bouquet of silk flowers, there is very little authenticity in Love Live; its worldview is far too picturesque, too quixotic, for its own good. In the world of Love Live, conflicts are resolved entirely through dogged persistence, flashbacks galore, BS logic, and the power of friendship. Any chemistry issue within the idol group is negated by the characters constantly complimenting one another. \u201cYou\u2019re the best!\u201d \u201cNo. I\u2019m not that special. YOU\u2019RE the best.\u201d NO; YOU\u2019RE THE BEST!\u201d I\u2019m almost positive that roughly 70 percent of Love Live\u2019s script is composed of exchanges like that.\\n\\n\r\nWhen Honoka\u2019s idol group wish to compete in the School Idol Tournament, the school director allows them to do so, no questions asked. She doesn't explain to them the financial costs of this decision to them nor does she schedule a meeting with their parents and teachers to determine whether or not this course of action is wise. If you thought that was an egregious example of a show bypassing logic for the sake of moving the plot forward, then, boy, do I have news for you. Love Live managed to land the jackpot in logical fallacies twice during the same episode. The first was the aforementioned example with the school director. The second? Well, allow me to explain. The director has permitted Honoka\u2019s group to participate in the School Idol Tournament only if everyone within the group lands a passing grade on an upcoming test. Because of this, everyone is diligently preparing for the big day, with Umi, Kotori, Maki, Hanayo, and Nozomi tutoring the academically challenged members of the group, specifically Honoka (she possesses the intellect of a second grader despite being in high school because of anime logic). After everyone finishes their test, the idol group members convene to share their scores with one another. They quickly discover that every member passed; however, Honoka hasn\u2019t shared her score with anyone. As the group begs her to reveal her grade, a few members express regret that their efforts will be worthless if Honoka failed. It is right then and there that Honoka dramatically unveils the graded test that was concealed behind her back. With the inspiring orchestral strings blaring in the background and a larger-than-life grin plastered on Honoka\u2019s face, her graded test is revealed\u2026. to have a score of 53.\\n\\n\r\nI would like to note that, in Japan, a 53 is a failing grade, just like it is in the rest of the world.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as acts of stupidity are concerned, this was simply breathtaking. That Love Live treated Honoka\u2019s score like some sort of grandiose achievement is not only absolutely hilarious but it\u2019s quite perplexing as well.\\n\\n\r\nWhat was the criteria for passing? To answer correctly more than half of the questions?\\n\r\nDid the teachers accept Honoka\u2019s test as a passing grade because he/she pitied Honoka?\\n\r\nWas the teacher bribed by Honoka\u2019s parents to pass her?\\n\\n\r\nNow that I\u2019m thinking about it, I know exactly why Honoka passed: because Honoka is Love Live\u2019s protagonist and presenting her with a challenging obstacle is far beyond LL\u2019s capabilities.\\n\\n\r\nDuring Love Live\u2019s final three episodes, the narrative attempted something new, gravitating towards poorly handled melodrama like a moth being drawn towards a burning candle. The result was the nadir of a thoroughly average title; Love Live\u2019s emo phase flopped because it was overbearing (especially with the histrionic soap opera that was episode 12), because it was extremely jarring (completely antithetical to a series that, up to this point, was directed towards maid cafes and pillow fights), and because it disappeared the instant that Nico ordered Honoka to stop being angsty. Amidst all of the melodrama, Love Live\u2019s finale introduced us to the highlight of the entire series, a truly beautiful scene with Honoka and Umi reminiscing on the stage of their first concert. It reminded me of what the underrated western Justified used to excel at, simply placing two characters in a given setting and allowing its masterful script to take it from there. With the aforementioned scene in Love Live, there was no overpowering song in the background, no special effects, and no unnecessary camera angles. It was just Honoka and Umi shooting the breeze. As I was watching all of this unfold, I thought to myself, \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t Love Live bother to do something like this before?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nIf Love Live really is the best that the idol genre has to offer, then I certainly won't expose myself to more of its ilk. Yes, Love Live possesses an excellent soundtrack, a lovable character in Umi, and a spark of untapped potential or two. However, that is hardly enough to deliver it from my wrath. Not only does this show have a repulsive love affair with its protagonist but it treats every other character with the utmost contempt. Not only does this show appeal to the lowest common denominator but it also insults your intelligence. Not only does this show enrage with its wasted potential but it also shoots itself in the foot with its constant tonal shifts. Vapid yet infuriating, erratic yet meandering, bewildering yet unenticing, Love Live is a jack of many trades and a master of wasting your time. Dancing girls and flashing lights cannot redeem this scrap heap of mediocrity.",

            "content": "Love Live! Is a School Idol Project, hence the name of course. I tried to get into Idolmaster, but something just wasn't blowing my skirt up.\r\nHowever, Love Live! Jumps into things a little bit faster and it's funny and such a guilty pleasure. It's not bad but it's not excellent either. It's something to watch to make you smile and hum along when they sing and to laugh at the characters. It's not here to blow your mind, it's an Idol anime after all.\r\nStory - 7\r\nThe story is about this all girl's school (at least I don't remember every seeing any boys), Otonokizaka High School,and it's going to be closed down in a few years because it's not attracting any new students. So, three students decide to start an Idol club because school idols are really popular at the time. Now with determination they are working to recruit more members and become one of the best school idol groups.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not a bad story, but it's not that big of one either. It's just a simple little thing to get the anime going. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 8\\n\\n\r\nThe art is not bad in anyway. The dances are laid out very well and the characters look nice. Everything is appealing to look at and nothing makes you cringe about how poorly drawing things are. The characters are cute and all is well.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is VERY good. The singing matches the voices, by that I mean it sounds like the singing voice matches the characters voice. I'm not sure how this works (pardon my fail research skills) but it doesn't sound like different singers for the characters, which is great. The sounds are catchy and sound really nice. The OST isn't bad either.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 8.5\\n\\n\r\nI feel like the characters are lacking a bit. We know who is who and how their basic personalities are, but you don't really know much about history - SO FAR. I'm caught up with the current episode and I'll update this later, but we know very little of some of the characters. Some of them we know a little more about, however it isn't much. Each character seems to have a distinct personality though, and we already have seen a tiny bit of character development.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9\\n\\n\r\nI have been really enjoying this anime. I love girly things like this, it makes me feel so young again and I love singing and music. Enjoyment is hard to write about because it's how the viewer feels. I personally like watching all of the characters and their different ways, however some may feel differently.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7.5 ( 8 )\\n\\n\r\nI give this anime a 7.5 rating, but since you can't do that on here, it's an 8. The story is simple and kicks off the anime giving it a good start. The art isn't bad, but its not amazing either, and the characters are cute and hilarious. The sound is very nice, OST and the idol's singing and dancing. My enjoyment of this is high and the overall is decent. I say give this a shot, if you don't like it, oh well. To each his own.",

What was once at least a sugary sweet piece of candy loses its charm. The class mate boob grab gag get's overused, one character is literally a cat, and most saddening of all, the music is kinda meh when compared to other tracks I have heard come out the Love Live project.

            "content": "What does it mean to sell out? For many, this term is often used in a negative light, to suggest giving up artistic integrity for the sake of appealing to the fans and getting all the profits. The sad fact is that in this day and age, more auteur products that try to tell different stories from the norm don\u2019t sell well, and that the mainstream is cluttered with copies banking on past trends for the sake of appeal. This applies to movies, TV, and even anime. Sure, there are exceptions to this, as there always are, but more often than not, I feel likethose are the products that get extremely popular, regardless of what substance lies behind them.\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings me to Love Live. If you\u2019re familiar with Japan\u2019s anime culture post 2013, you\u2019ve likely seen this franchise EVERYWHERE. It\u2019s a continuous fad really, cute girls in costumes singing pop songs. In America, you\u2019ve probably seen Love Live lines up at anime conventions all over, with tons and tons of merchandise (even incredibly creepy head masks of the girls). The franchise collectively took up THREE spots in the Top 9 of Japan\u2019s most recent Top 100 anime poll, and even the spinoff series was voted higher than Cowboy freakin Bebop! Hell, one person I know in my personal anime club doesn\u2019t even like the anime but plays the phone game to upgrade her idols like crazy!\\n\\n\r\nAs for me, I\u2019ve always been hesitant about Love Live. While sometimes I am proven wrong with stuff like Konosuba or Madoka Magica, most anime tend to be exactly what\u2019s on their cover, and the cover for Love Live looked overly bright, and relying on excess cute girl appeal with the name \u201cProject\u201d attached to the show basically saying \u201cyup, we\u2019re making this specifically to merchandise\u201d, much like K Project which I have similar feelings on. LL just didn\u2019t interest me, but I did like K-On, so when I finally went to check it out alongside many other anime reviewers, hoping it wouldn\u2019t be a sellout series, I was....not entirely let down, but still given exactly what I expected. A show trying to push current trends, having writing on the level of your average Disney sitcom, and all and all just being incredibly basic in every department. While I could enjoy different parts of Love Live, and the production behind it is generally great, the show itself never rose above follower entertainment.\\n\\n\r\nSome spoilers below:\\n\\n\r\nIt begins a young teenage girl named Honoka, finding out that GASP! Her school is going to close down! One day, when going to see her sister\u2019s school, she sees a famous idol group, and dramatically DROPS EVERYTHING to want to be an idol just like them. She then pushes her two friends, and then overtime slowly convinces new members to follow the idol path, because maybe being idols will be enough to save their school, to the chagrin of the student council President. That\u2019s the general synopsis, and if you\u2019re familiar with this type of \u201csave the school\u201d storyline, you\u2019re probably aware of exactly what to expect and go in knowing. Inevitably, idols will be preached, naysayers will be disproven, and the school will be saved, with everyone in the OP becoming an idol by the end. However, being predictable isn\u2019t immediately a crime, as even great shows can be predictable, and sometimes unpredictable shows can have haphazard plot structure or nonsensical plot twists in hindsight.\\n\\n\r\nSo what does Love Live add to it beyond exactly what you\u2019d expect to add some depth to the image? Mixed results.\\n\r\nThere are some moments to this stock premise that feel like things actually add to the story. While Honoka\u2019s motivation is as simplistic as it gets, a few of the other girls have pretty solid backdrops to want or not want to be idols in how it affects their character arcs. The name \u201cMuse\u201d they chose for their group was a clever choice in hindsight, including after a little revelation of how it was there. Another plus is the fact that the idols have to practice being idols, and some of the ideas behind this were kind of fun to see, like the whole \u201csmile while you push up\u201d thing, or the idea of holding poses for long amounts of time. They make it clear there is definitely some struggle and people who will crack at them.\\n\r\nDespite this though, almost all of it feels montaged through. While the effort is definitely there, perhaps seeing more of it actually happening rather than saying it happened would\u2019ve worked better for the overall narrative, instead of saving it all for the showcases where they seem to do it perfectly in their robotic CGI sometimes bodies. This even hurts some of the comedy. One episode revolves around the infamous NicoNico trying to prove how hard certain tasks of singing, dancing and personal appeal are to the other girls, but they just feel like they do it with no problem at all to Nico\u2019s chagrin. And we don\u2019t see any of it. It makes it feel like the show saying that Nico\u2019s persistence led to her whole group getting disbanded harder to believe.\\n\\n\r\nAside from that, most of what you get from Love Live is extremely vanilla and safe. After all, that\u2019s what people have approved in the past, why change that image if you\u2019ll make profits from it? Of course everyone sees the errors of their ways if they don\u2019t want to be idols. Of course there\u2019s a beach episode. Of course the girls dress up in cafe maid costumes, there\u2019s merch to be sold of that! Of course some of the girls have surprisingly low IQ for high schoolers, not knowing what 5 squared is and randomly forgetting basically grammatical structure in one scene only for it to never come up prior or after, we need tests!\\n\r\nAnd of course, having your boobs squeezed as punishment, which was probably a low point for me in regards to running gags that weren\u2019t funny the first time.\\n\\n\r\nIn contrast, the drama actually feels like the opposite. It\u2019s not something spread out throughout the show, but rather, mostly transplanted entirely in the final episodes for the sake of it. \\n\\n\r\nFirst off, it is only in the episode 11, the day of their festival, that it is stated where certain clubs are positioned is due to lottery. Such a thing was never stated before and feels inserted for the sake of cheap drama and about two minutes of crying. And then, immediately after, Honoka, in practicing, decides to do so alone, on a cold, dark, rainy night, gets a fever and collapses midway through the show because of it. Again, it makes it hard to care for the show\u2019s drama when it feels so forced. Then, following that, more drama pours salt into the wound, and rather than thinking about a sub member, like many actual bands, Honoka decides to QUIT IDOLS FOREVER?! Jezz lousie....Thankfully the slap that follows felt incredibly satisfying in consequence, but everything at the end felt needlessly heavy in contrast to so much to bring something apart only to bring it together at the very end. The ending is admittedly nice and sweet, if a bit predictable, but the ride there was...to put it simply milquetoast up the hill and bumpy down the uptake partly both at its best and worst when it focused on character interactions.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, in general, contribute to the vanilla feeling of the show by feeling like they were designed specifically to be merchandised, but there were some bright spots to ultimately make a passable bunch.\\n\\n\r\nStarting with the lead, Honoka, she\u2019s basically the self-proclaimed Red Ranger of the group, the one who brings the passion, cuteness, pushiness, and forced drama at the end. She could have a few likable moments as the lead character, though I feel like she needed to do more in terms of actual contribution. There\u2019s an episode dedicated to who should lead the group, and Honoka, who WAS the leader, wins out because of how much she cared. Hooray. Also, to put it simply she\u2019s....not very bright. Somehow not knowing what 5 squared is in 10th grade, and getting a 53 on her final exam WITH excessive studying. You could argue that justifies some of her decisions, but it did not make her incredible tendency to push everyone along for things that much less irritating, nor the fact that she\u2019s rewarded in the end for being selfish.\\n\r\nShe\u2019s cute and marketable though, so I guess Sunrise succeeded somewhere.\\n\\n\r\nUmi, her closest friend, is probably one of the best characters for being generally level headed and being the Only Sane Girl in a lot of cases, and her moment near the end in calling out Honoka was a highlight, but aside from a miniskirt line that reminded me of Fullmetal Alchemist, not much about her really stood out with me.\\n\\n\r\nKotori is mostly passable. She has two separate dramas, both of which are pulled out of nowhere and resolved quite cleanly. Not much of an issue the first time, very much so the second. Seeing her pursue her own passion and not be led back by Honoka\u2019s selfish one would\u2019ve been a more interesting setup for a possible season 2, but her character is generally fine.\\n\\n\r\nRin and Hanayo are basically pretty decoration (also merchandise). They get one episode of their own, which wasn\u2019t bad, but then disappear completely. Rin also has the shy girl thing Kotori already covered. Moving on.....\\n\\n\r\nTo cover both Maki and Eli at the same time, both of them were against the whole idea of idol performances at first, and had me worrying that they would be seen as Strawmen. For those who don\u2019t know, a Strawman is someone so steadfast in being wrong that they can easily be defeated by our protagonists. But in actuality, they actually had some of the best character growth of the bunch. Maki especially, the ending of Episode 10 was another highlight for the series thanks to her revelation. Eli annoyed me a lot at first in how much she seemed to be against them, and while her reason for developing felt a bit too convenient yet separate from idol-ing, her being a more big sister coach near the end was a bright spot and she was tied up well.\\n\\n\r\nNico, despite being infamous for her annoying meme catchphrase, was probably one of the better characters overall. She had a strong personality, and her point on memorable personas was pretty solid, even if it (and hiding in public) never amounted to anything of consequence. Props to Erica Mendez in the dub for giving her a lot of expression.\\n\\n\r\nEnding off with my least favorite, Nozomi. She was by far the hardest to like. Not for being a stealth mentor, that\u2019s something I can buy, but for basically being a gag machine. One gag. Specifically. That being, squeezing boobs of the girls as punishment. It became her only character thing for a while and the One Squeeze gag was not funny the first time yet was consistently repeated to my annoyance. Gotta have that fanservice right?\\n\\n\r\nEveryone else was basically there to preach idolism, whenever it called for it. It was a solid effort to try and develop so many main characters, but I don\u2019t think it paid off, as with some exceptions most show as pretty faces on toys more than anything else.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, speaking of pretty, gosh darn it this show can look great in the best of times. Mecha oriented Studio Sunrise took the reins for an idol series, and when it wants to, the show really shines. Lots of bright colors, polished character designs, a large variety of different outfits, some gorgeous view shots and even the CGI used for the dancing is relatively high quality. Only real catch with the visuals, basic character designs being a minor thing, is the constant switch between 2D to 3D during the idol performances. I didn\u2019t like when Luck & Logic did the switches for no reason and I\u2019m not a fan of it here either. It\u2019s jarring, and plays a weird eye trick on me when they change back and forth. Still though, great animation and pretty colors, adds to the image.\\n\\n\r\nWhat\u2019s more disappointing is the soundtrack. I get that I\u2019m not really an idol fan, but aside from the OP, no particular showcase track really stood out at all. Maybe I\u2019d have to relisten to them, but even Kyoukai no Kanata\u2019s 1 idol song was more memorable than any of these. They weren\u2019t bad, they did their job, just didn\u2019t leave a strong impression which is disappointing for a music anime. The ED is perfectly fine and listenable, same for the background music. As for the dub, we have some solid performances from Erica Lindbeck as Eli, who brings an air of maturity to the role, Caitlin Glass as Maki, and even though I could be annoyed with Honoka\u2019s character at times, relative newbie Marieve Herington captures just enough energy to make her cute in the best of times. Again, special mention to Erica Mendez for capturing the personality in Nico\u2019s character. Everyone else did fine, nothing exceptional but nothing outright bad.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\\n\r\nSo, after all of this, would I consider Love Live a sellout? In some ways yes. The plot is incredibly shallow and sometimes forced, it relies a lot on pushing current trends to be a follower and the characters aren\u2019t too much to show for, but I can\u2019t deny that, once in a while, the show had an honest to god sweet moment, a moment where I excepted depth comes into play, or a charming scene. Despite how simplistic everything was, my enjoyment was decently high for a while. Then when the end drama sprouted its way into the final three episodes, I became annoyed more than anything else. Annoyed with what I saw unfold, creating substantial pathos before quickly having it brushed aside. It became a lot harder to emphasize with Honoka, and it didn\u2019t end well for me despite the ending being sweet. Love Live has earnest effort, at times I can see that, but with exception to some moments and characters, feels misguided, perfectly in the norm, and hard to distinguish otherwise. It\u2019s a show that failed to have me engaged and sadly fell too close to the disinterest that kept me away from it for so long.\\n",

            "content": "Bad, boring and bland. While the times where these terms are applicable are many, they rarely are as universally applicable and descriptive as they are with Love Live. Everything, barring a single ray of hope in the entire show, can be described as such. Everything, ranging from plot, to characters, to the J-Pop music, everything in this show, all of it is bad, boring and bland.\r\nFair warning: This review contains spoilers!\r\nOn paper, the concept sounds simple: a series about cute school idols singing and dancing their way to stardom. While the concept itself admittedly didn\u2019t excite me all that much in the first place, theflimsy plot and its boring structure still managed to disappoint. The initial conflict, the school of the protagonists closing down and merging with another school, is uninteresting. At a point where the cast isn\u2019t even properly introduced yet, there isn\u2019t any actual investment present. Consequently, I couldn\u2019t have cared less about the school \u201cclosing down\u201d, and honestly I still wonder why the characters did, anyway. Now, building on this\u2026 questionable initial problem, Honoka decides that forming a school idol group will make the school more popular. This is supposed to save the school from closing down. A very simple problem-solution relationship, in the mind of Honoka, at least. \\n\\n\r\nAn empty auditorium. No audience at all. This is the picture painted by the first performance of their newly-founded idol group, Muse. This empty auditorium as such symbolizes the start line, the start for a story of this group ascending from rags, unpopular amateurs, to riches, universally beloved and popular school idols. This display of passion by Muse is recorded by an anonymous spectator, later revealed to be Eri (who actually is shown peeking into the auditorium and then leaving, but I digress). Slowly but steadily, the group grows into a group of nine girls of fluctuating distinctiveness. \\n\\n\r\nSeemingly out of nowhere and with little fanfare, the eponymous competition Love Live is introduced. Measured by an arbitrary level of popularity which is never properly explained, the 20 top school idol groups compete for the title of \u201cthe best idol group\u201d. The plot gradually loses track, loses focus and during loosely related events only introduced to serve as a platform for short concerts, Muse grows increasingly popular. Little to no feeling of progression is actually present through the whole ordeal. Instead of showing other idol groups, how they are different in style and skill level, the show presents meaningless numbers that mean little and tell nothing. Due to the pacing and the poor handling of the supposed new main attraction Love Live, it  becomes obvious that there isn\u2019t enough time left to actually have the competition take place. The show has to make do with another kind of finale, while still leaving the potential goal of winning Love Live open for another installment.\\n\\n\r\nThe introduction of another conflict was foreseeable. But, somehow, the show still manages to introduce something way out of left field. Kotori gets an invitation to follow her dream of fashion designing. Honoka is so eager to practice on the last night before her final concert that she decides to do it outside, in the middle of the night under pouring rain. She catches a cold and collapses right after their first song. Muse (like expected) withdraws from Love Live and Honoka throws a fit, the situation escalates until Honoka gets slapped in the face. This supposed \u201cclimax\u201d left nothing but confusion and frustration. The whole conflict did, really. Kotori\u2019s interest in fashion design and her possibly leaving the country in the future gets introduced too late to feel like a genuine \u201cthreat\u201d, like something that could actually happen. It is obvious from the get-go that she won\u2019t leave the country and will stay with the group, because it\u2019s obvious this \"threat\" is only introduced for it the be resolved as the series\u2019 finale. It is obvious that this show will follow the most formulaic storytelling possible. The whole conflict feels like it doesn\u2019t belong in the show at all. It all ends in a very cliche scene in which Honoka stops Kotori at the last possible minute and they make up. They make up because Honoka is selfish and puts her desire to have a group of nine with Kotori in it (rather than just continuing as a group of eight or recruit a new member) over Kotori\u2019s dream. Because Kotori didn\u2019t actually want to leave, apparently. Love Live manages to be both predictable in its overall structure and unpredictable in its sheer stupidity. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot does follow established formulas all the way through. However this doesn\u2019t only apply to the overall structure, but to about anything else as well. It comes off as no surprise that the character cast of Love Live consists of flat and tropey characters. In an attempt to include as many different girls which appeal to as many different (otaku) people possible, the show neglects nearly all of them completely. The most prominent example is Rin. Initially interested in track, she urges her friend Hanayo to join Muse, then decides to join too while she\u2019s at it. For the rest of the show her being athletic will never be brought up again and her only character traits are that she likes Hanayo and the usage of \u201cnyan\u201d while making a cat mouth. Hanayo herself is at first a shy and quiet girl that loves school idols, then devolves into a character whose only trait is liking idols right after joining the group. However the saving grace of this show, Nico, is also mainly defined by loving school idols however, compared to Hanayo she excels at it.  Therein lies the next big problem of the show: There is a lot of overlap between the character casts\u2019 traits, to the point were they are hardly distinguishable at times. Apart from Nico and Honoka, the cast feels too same-y, like interchangeable trope characters. The few attempts at constructing interesting (albeit also cliched) character relations such as the relationship between Eri and Nozomi, get wholly destroyed through the show\u2019s numerous reiterations of that very relationship. While it is clear for any onlooker that Nozomi is very close to Eri, for some reason the show needs the characters to outright state that this relationship exists through the characters pointing it out several times. \u201cShow, don\u2019t tell\u201d is one of the most popular writing advices and for good reason. These moments are oleaginous and make the character relationships feel artificial.\\n\\n\r\nLove Live isn\u2019t all bad however, and while the visuals don't stand out as much as a whole, the backgrounds are consistently pretty and pleasing to look at with a lot of detail. The character designs however have the same problems as the characters themselves: They all are colorcoded to fit their respective archetypes and their body figures cover the most ground possible to appeal to the largest number of (otaku) people possible. If not for the aforementioned colorcoding I would have trouble remembering the characters; all of them, again apart from Nico and Eri, are bland to a fault. Character movement is for the most part well-animated, although admittedly only Nico stands out from the crowd with the by far most energetic movement and most expressive faces (again).\\n\\n\r\nThe performances themselves were okay. While the constant changing between 2D and 3D animation is pretty jarring (mostly because the CG isn\u2019t all that pretty), all of the performances were energetically animated. Overall they were more fun to look at than to listen to though. The songs themselves never go farther than average to mediocre J-Pop with the only song remotely resembling a standout track being \u201cSTART:DASH!!\u201d. It\u2019s also a shame that the supposed standouts, Maki as a singer and Eri as a dancer, never actually have standout moments during the show.\\n\\n\r\nLove Live is a show that is mediocre all the way through: Boring archetype characters, poor plot with forced melodrama that doesn\u2019t fit the overall tone of the show and bland J-Pop songs merge and create an overall bad experience. The few moments of genuine fun, mostly in the form of Nico\u2019s fun shenanigans, shine through here and there but they aren\u2019t enough to save this show from feeling like a oleaginous corporate product.\\n",

            "content": "This show is a sad guilty pleasure of mine. I shouldn't like this, but I did. \r\nIt shows what hard work can really achieve. Especially with so much competition out there. It can really motivates you to be successful. With all that aside  the show is very shallow and simple.\r\nCute girls dancing and singing to save their beloved school.\r\nStory: Based around nine girls working to become idols and save their school. The initial story is okay, but nothing ever goes past that. The plot is weak and suffers from this, but what can you expect from a 13 episode series. The story can onlybe comparable when you take a slice-of-life. Each episode itself has it's own story. Don't expect much from it. I simply watched it for fun, nothing more or less. \\n\\n\r\nPut aside potential flaws it gave a calming and easygoing atmosphere. This made the show feel comfortable. Like laying in your bed at night, nothing really changes, but it doesn't ever feel uncertain. \\n\r\nSorry fans of this show but I'm going to give the story a 6.\\n\\n\r\nArt: It wasn't bad at all. I didn't even know sunrise could make this high of quality. All aspects of the girls stage, and clothing were unique and changed often. This kept me waiting to see the next outfit. \\n\r\nWatching in HD i could tell some of the drawings during performances almost looked 3d. This wasn't necessarily a bad thing. At times it got weird to watch and i almost wished it would just stay 2d. It was more likely done because of budget.  Much better than other shows *cough cough* .\\n\r\nArt is an 8.  \\n\\n\r\nSound: I can't say much since i watched it in subbed and not many emotions were expressed through the characters. Other than that as far I could tell they fit the characters, nothing oddball my ears could hear. \\n\r\nWho could forget about the music. Most of the songs picked were very catchy and often found myself bobbing my head.\\n\r\nThis deserves an 8. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: This is where the show failed to deliver on. For the first couple of episodes I didn't even know Kitori's mom was the principle. By this time almost the whole group had been already established. \\n\r\nwhen looking back at it most of the group was very 2 dimensional. Backgrounds never spoken, wondering even if some of the girls said a word after wanting to join Muse. \\n\r\nAlthough the ones that were shown some light had different personalities. All these differences make them very lovable. You could basically read all these characters, like the back of your hand. \\n\r\nThis was very traumatizing to characters, and made it almost boring. \\n\r\nWhat could be more wrong? The fact that not once did they develop really in much of a way. \\n\r\n-The over dramatic sad scene at the end didn't prove anything.\\n\r\nCharacter, gets a 5.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Like i said i really enjoyed this. Probably much more than I should have. Just the cuteness of everything kept me going. What does that say about me? I am a sucker for cute girls dancing in cute costumes. Hell Yeah! \\n\r\nA 7 for enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Don't set goals high, at best don't set any. With that type of thinking you might like it. \\n\r\nTheir are many shows of this variety, that said the originality is near zero. I don't recommend this if you look for deep plot inducing anime. I am forewarning you that their is not one guy in this. The rest is your choice at this point, is it worth watching or not? I would respond with yes. My hormones kept me going. I conclude my official first review with a 7.",

            "content": "Now, people are gonna think I'm biased, and yes, all reviews are biased, so... I'll try to be fair as possible, but I'll start off with a quite possibly outlandish statement - this is my favourite anime. If you check my list, you may be surprised this is my favourite - but then again, there are a few I'm watching and a few on-hold... I'll get back to them, ANYWAYS..\r\nSTORY - Not the best, not the worst. *MINOR SPOILERS* The story revolves mainly around three girls, 2nd years in high school, who want to save there school from closing, as people just aren't applying. Hakone,the main protagonist, loves idols, and sees idols are attracting students to other schools. So she, along with her cute friends, the energetic Kotori and shy Umi, after a bit of convincing on Umi's side, make an idol group. They find out from the school council that there is all ready an idol club, and so convince the only remaining member of the club, Yazawa, to let them join. It's safe to say all goes well, but that's the general gist, I'll leave the non-viewers to experience.\\n\r\nART - I love the art. It's clean and sharp, and very bright and colourful. Some people don't like CGI, but you can't argue with the picture it creates. It's all very beautiful.\\n\r\nSOUND - The sound is outstanding. I mean, it's a musical anime anyway, with it being about idol's and everything, but just listen to the intro theme. That is literally on my phone for the sole reason of being my alarm! And the ending theme! And all the songs in between!\\n\r\nCHARACTER - The characters in this are very personal to me. They are introduced at a reasonable pace, with the 3 main characters being the only 3 of the club for about half the anime, so you get used to them, and the others being recruited for various reasons (previous acting, infuated by idols looks etc). But the 3 main characters remind me, a male, of me and my 3 childhood friends. Sure, that makes 4, but it's still very, very personal, and anyone who is in the same boat as me will understand!\\n\r\nOVERALL/ENJOYMENT - As I stated at the beggining, this is totally my favourite anime, and it comes down to two things: The personal characters and the awesome music. I won't go on any long, but will end with my score, I can't give it anything more than a 10/10.",

The plot, The character everything was perfect, the song, the soundtrack, the characterof each of the idol. This anime change my whole perspective towards idol based anime.

What got me to like this anime was the music, its cute and catchy, and i love music like that.

            "content": "When this show was airing I decided not to watch Love Live, because its  ain't my style however I ended up watching it because of the rhythm game app I found in a commercial.\r\nThis show is really enjoyable. The art, and music were really great and I found myself somehow excited to watch the next episode (hasn't happened in a while.) Now I know I said its enjoyable, but only if you don't really think about it. (I watched while I waited for my LP to refill) \r\nThe plot is a group of girls become idols to save their school. Original really, however Ifound it extremely unrealistic because everything seemed to go the main girls way, and they all knew how to sing. Its odd seeing nine people extremely talented at singing to the point they don't need to practice. It also was really predictable, I could for see every character who joined, (you can say its because of the opening, but no. Its just predictable.) And it was all shounen anime where every enemy suddenly become friends with the main. Character. Do people even like their school that much? Why does she love that school so much? Is it because her mom went their? Why?!\\n\\n\r\nArt was good since it went between 2D animation and MMD's I think their called. (Though I've seen better quality ones on YouTube.) The songs manage to make me smile and all were fully translated which was nice since I'm big on lyrics.\\n\\n\r\nDespite this being a more anime it wasn't really moe which is odd. K-on which is a similar show I manage to love at least 2 of their characters (Mio and Azunyan) but with I didn't really like any besides Niko and that's just because I managed to relate to her ( my friends blow me off a lot.) Also the main girl everything went her way, it was seriously annoying. \\n\\n\r\n[Spoiler] \\n\r\nAt the end one of the girls was about to leave and the main chick goes into the airport right as she was about to board the plane (how did she get in?) And talked her into staying. (What happened to the plane ticket? You can't just stop stuf like that. Also she is seriously selfish. I've been told I'm selfish, but I'm selfish in a sense that I do my own thing. I don't mess anyone else's life up. She does something she drags everyone down with her.\\n\r\n[Spoiler]\\n\\n\r\nOverall I think this show needs more moe. The only reason I can see someone watching this is so they can play the rhythm game. (It isn't needed but it makes it easier to choose favorites.) The show wasn't funny, moe, or even inspirational. I don't think being a idol would be tough if you can control the weather, and have amazing talent like that, and get everything else you want. Like she screamed at the rain to stop and it did! I'm not even joking. Screw being a idol, be a weather girl. If I had the chance to go back in time and stop myself from watching this I probably would. Yeah watching it is enjoyable but once you get down and think about it you go into this living hell!",

            "content": "Disclaimers: Spoilers, this review covers the Love Live! School Idol Project anime series, which means season 1, 2, and the movie, and this review will be a bit more personal than your typical review. This review is also long as fuck, and there will be a spoiler free TL;DR at the end. \r\nLove Live sucks major balls.\r\nUpon viewing my profile, one would probably witness a few Love Live memes here and there, a shit ton of Love Live characters in my favorites list, and possibly a Love Live profile picture, although I constantly change it so it depends. Seems like a typical Love Live fagto most people. However, believe it or not, I think Love Live is pretty god damn bad. Or at least, I thought. If anything, the only things that I actively like about it are the characters, usually because they are extremely entertaining, endearing, and lovable (with the exception of one character, which I will get to later.) The story of Love Live is mediocre at best, and one could argue that the story is completely garbage. With cliche and cringey moments, overly sappy melodrama, and with uneven character development to boot, one shouldn\u2019t watch Love Live for a quality story. I can\u2019t really say anything about the music of Love Live, since music is like the most subjective thing in the world, but I don\u2019t like most idol music. There are only a few songs that I can listen to multiple times, but most of the time, I can barely sit through the songs even once. The art and animation are subpar as well, especially when the camera zooms out and the characters become barely recognizable sketches. So why do I still like Love Live so much, despite all the shit that it has?\\n\\n\r\nAfter a VERY lackluster first season, I sat down and reflected on the past 4 hours that I wasted on this show and thought to myself: holy shit, I had a good time. Why is it that such a flawed story is able to leave me in such a satisfied state? No way is it because \u201cit\u2019s so bad that it\u2019s good,\u201d nor is it because \u201cyou\u2019re a dirty memer Yuni, and Love Live is full of dirty memes.\u201d I came to the conclusion that it\u2019s because of how memorable Love Live as a franchise is. Despite my cringey experience watching the first season, I found myself thinking about Love Live constantly afterwards, and not about how bad the drama was handled or how gimmicky and cliche the characters were, but of how catchy that one song I actually liked was or how\u2026 gimmicky and cliche the characters were, but in a good way! I would then get flashbacks to a random scene, such as Kotori acting like a foreigner, Nozomi fondling little boobs, or Honk Honk doing the seal clap in episode one. Little scenes like that, although usually just comedic skits or filler, gave me such great satisfaction that I felt like it was worth sitting through Honoka dying on stage for no reason. Even so, I still wasn\u2019t ready to say that I liked Love Live at the time. I simply liked a few of the scenes, a few of the characters, and a few of the songs. Everything else was still meh.\\n\\n\r\nThen Season 2 reared it\u2019s ugly head and that\u2019s when my heart felt all the doki dokis. When it comes to \u201csequels that drastically improve the franchise\u2019s quality,\u201d people always think of Clannad After Story, or maybe Little Busters Refrain. I\u2019d like to add Love Live 2nd Season to that list, for I never knew a sequel could change my opinion of a franchise so quickly. Not only was the drama much more tolerable, but it made me fall in love with the cast so hard, that even the ones I borderline hated during season 1 were perfect angels in my eyes. In fact, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever loved a cast this much since Aria. And I fucking adore Aria. Then there was the movie, which not only depicted Manhattan pretty goddamn well (I\u2019m a New Yorker), but it also sent off \u03bc's the same way they were introduced to us: with a long drawn out bang. \\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nLove Live seems like your typical \u201cAH! Dire situations and sparks of inspiration cause me to drag my friends into something out of the ordinary, something that causes us to start out as underdogs as well slowly rise to the top through the power of friendship!\u201d kind of story, and that\u2019s basically what it is at the surface level. However, by the end of the story, the viewer doesn\u2019t give a fuck about whether or not \u03bc's is gonna succeed in their next concert, instead, they are desperately holding on to their doki doki-ing hearts in anticipation and preparing themselves for the inevitable: Honk Honk, here comes the feels train! This is what causes Love Live to be labeled as a completely clone of K-On, a show where a group of girls are in a similar situation: they want to do something out of the ordinary and strive to improve, however the story really isn\u2019t about that life. It\u2019s all about the passage of time, and Love Live makes it extremely apparent in its narrative that time is not only limited, but running out FAST! This is what separates Love Live from the other passage of time anime, as while K-On and Aria are taking their time sipping tea and rowing gondolas, Love Live is dancing along at a breakneck speed. The thing about passage of time anime is that it\u2019s really only effective if you love the characters. Both K-On and Aria start out with their characters in a very friendly environment, with all of the characters being lovable from the start and the only conflict resulting from the natural clashes between their personalities, such as Azu-nyan being put off by Yui\u2019s laziness, or Alice being mad at Akari\u2019s lack of IQ. Also keep in mind that passage of time anime usually have a manageable cast of main characters, with K On having 5 and Aria having 3 (4 if you count Alicia, and 6 if you count the other fairies). \\n\\n\r\nHowever, Love Live has a massive 9 main characters, some of which were outright hostile cockblockers during their introduction. You would think it would be impossible for a story to take 9 characters, some of which are shown to be bitches, and somehow make them lovable by the end. That\u2019s what I thought too at the end of season 1, where I was only fond of a select few characters. This is a big reason why season 1 was a fairly lackluster season, it failed to properly show that appeal of some of the characters. This isn\u2019t solely due to the fact that some characters were prioritized over others, it also has to do with how poorly the drama was handled. The words that come to mind are: overly exaggerated, sappy, bullshit. The realism in Love Live is non existent, but that is to be expected. Anyone who expects realism in a show like Love Live needs to get a reality check. That doesn\u2019t change how unnecessarily over the top some of the drama during the first season was, as well as how unbelievable some of the drama was resolved. Even if realism is limited, it still has to be believable, or at least, not bullshit.\\n\\n\r\nWhat the 1st season does correctly is a few instances of character drama surrounding a few particular characters, those being Honk, Kotori, Nico, and Eli. For Honk, her extremely typical main character attitude actually works against her in scenarios that other anime would write as beneficial. For example, her focus on competing in Love Live actually ends up damaging her relationship with her friends instead of strengthening them, and while some events surrounding this drama and the resolution are iffy, it still gets the job done. Kotori also breaks the mold when she goes against what her character trope would normally do: hurt her best friend. Usually depicted as the typical friendly deredere, Kotori was revealed to actually be a very conflicted character whose problems end up hurting those she loves, which is contradictory to her normal character. Both Nico and Eli are also fleshed out as characters who chased their dreams and failed, which shapes them into the hostile characters that they were introduced as, and while Nico's hostility was shown to just be natural, Eli's hostility was much deeper, albeit the resolution was stupid. Love Live's major problem in season 1 is that the drama is there, and for the most part it isn't exactly bad drama, but it has absolutely no idea how to either execute or resolve it in a believable way.\\n\\n\r\nHmm, it would appear that Honoka is very ill and not exactly in a good state to sing and dance. What do? The overly protective Kotori and the wiser Umi would stop Honoka from over exerting herself, causing the performance to be cancelled, the fans to be disappointed, and Honoka would learn her lesson and taste what disappointing her fans would be like. That would be some nice development for her character! But wait, that\u2019s not what actually happens. \\n\r\nWhat actually happens is that Honoka insists on performing, so she does. Honk has run out of PP for her dance moves! Honk used Struggle! Honk hurt herself in recoil. Honk fainted. And that leads to Honk being a depressed crybaby, \u03bc's dropping out of Love Live, Honk nearly quitting the school idol thing, only to get bitch slapped by Umi, which leads to Honk not being a crybaby, which leads to literally no one learning anything and Honk continues to do stupid shit cause why not.\\n\\n\r\nSo Season 1 ends with \u03bc's saving the school, and \u03bc's miss their chance to compete in Love Live. Oh well, beggers can\u2019t be choosers right? At least they completed their initial goal! As a result of her efforts, Season 2 starts with Honk being chosen to be the student council president. While this seemed like an unnecessary thing to do, this was the beginning of Love Live\u2019s redemption! It\u2019s all (mostly) positivity from here on out! Remember when I said that Love Live is a passage of time show? The moment Honk becomes student council president marks the beginning of this theme. While subtle, it did expand on the running out of time problem, as being the student council prez resulted in a lot of schedule conflicts between idol practice and council work. But wait, idol practice? What are they practicing for? A 2nd Love Live has been announced! With saving the school out of the way, \u03bc's can finally focus on their real goal.\\n\\n\r\nIt is here, pretty early on in season 2, that it is made clear that time is running out. This pressure of time, first mentioned when it is made clear that the 3rd years are graduating soon, is constantly brought up, both within the show itself and within the viewer\u2019s minds. At first it\u2019s through subtle things, such as the previously mentioned schedule conflicts of being the student council prez, resulting in usually humorous but still important bickerings between Honk and Umi. A sense of responsibility is placed on Honok\u2019s shoulders, as a leader of the school and of \u03bc's. \\n\\n\r\nSeason 2 also makes it clear that time is passing by through the use of specific events, such as Halloween, Christmas, New Years, etc. Many episodes in Season 2 are based around these timed events, and result in a not-so subtle flow of time. By the way, the Halloween episode is one of my favorites, as it has some of my favorite skits in the entire series. Season 2 also uses this time to flesh out characters that didn\u2019t have much spotlight in season 1, and while these moments of character development were touching, it was all the characters and their interactions with each other that made me adore every single member. Time didn\u2019t just flow, it helped the girls grow to love each other. Episode after episode, you could tell that their friendship was subtly growing, and it\u2019s all about the little things. Maki agreeing with Honk sometimes, Eli and Nozomi showing their more innocent and sensitive sides to their kouhais, even the most humorous of skits showed that the teamwork and bond between the girls of \u03bc's were ever growing.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the urgency of time running out is at first caused by \u03bc's trying to do something before a deadline, eventually it became much deeper than that. While the story kept its style of \u03bc's trying to get something done before a specific time, it became clear that both the characters and the viewers were actually bracing for the real deadline: the time when the 3rd years would graduate, and \u03bc's would be split apart. This is what the entire series was building up towards. As the cliche line goes, all good things must come to an end. Even the mightiest of rivers empty out into the calm endless sea. Even a floating leaf in the wind will land someday. Whatever sappy phrase you want to use, this theme is so especially present in Love Live that it\u2019s undeniably powerful. In fact, \u03bc's spent so much of their time bracing themselves for this inevitable end that they didn\u2019t even realize that they were missing an important answer: what do they want their end to be?\\n\\n\r\nThis is the entire theme of the finale, the movie. The movie is the perfect mix of cute grills doing cute things, cute grills dancing in cute ways, and borderline psychological drama. It even has hints of supernatural elements, which were used in very effective albeit confusing ways. After becoming much more famous than she could ever imagine, with expectations placed on every part of her being, Honk\u2019s internal conflicts were at an all time high. To a normal viewer, the right answer isn\u2019t clear at all. In fact, many people could have different answers when placed in Honk\u2019s situation. There really is no right or wrong answer, and the decision that \u03bc's came to at the end wasn\u2019t right or wrong either. It was simply what they wanted. And that\u2019s how the passage of time works. A very straight forward story, with a not so straightforward and possibly even thought provoking end. Even so, despite the melancholic passing of time and the internal conflicts, the ending was ultimately a positive one, and I can\u2019t help but feel the ultimate satisfaction.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nEasily my favorite part of the franchise, as well as probably the make or break for anyone watching Love Live. To some, they are simply gimmicks and memes who are mildly entertaining once in awhile, and to others, they are precious waifus that we must protect from any sort of harm. What do I think? I think they are precious gimmicky memes that are mildly entertaining once in awhile, and must be protected from any sort of harm. So of course I will be going through all of them.\\n\\n\r\nHanayo: Despite the fact that she's at the bottom of my list, Hanayo is probably the most well written character in LL in terms of characterization. The point of school idols is that any normal girl can be one, and that's the whole theme surrounding Hanayo. She doesn't stand out at all, in terms of personality nor appearance. As a result, she views school idols as an unreachable goal and worships them from afar. The fact that Hanayo joined Muse in the first place is a groundbreaking development for the group and idol shows as a whole, for it highlighted the whole point of school idols. Also, her rice obsession is one of the most relatable parts of the show. As a Chinese person, rice is my entire being.\\n\\n\r\nRin: My appreciation for this character is always exponentially increasing. Rin is insecurities personified into a tomboy cat character. Unlike Hanayo, Rin has had experiences of standing out too much, having being teased for her femininity despite her short hair and boyish attitude. This caused Rin to embrace this boyish attitude and energy in order to separate herself from her insecurities. Rin was very hesitant in joining Muse since being school idols is hella girly and she feel like her lack of femininity will cause her to bring the group down. However, her joining the group ends up helping her come to terms with her insecurities, and her episode was one of the most heartfelt episodes in the series.\\n\\n\r\nMaki: Maki's tsundere personality comes off less as a mental illness and more of a result of her upbringing. Due to being a sheltered rich girl, Maki isn't a tsundere cause she's mean, but because she's socially retarded lol. However, joining Muse helped her shed her awkward self contained self, and Maki is one of the few tsunderes who returns the favor to those who helped her break out of her shell. After being coaxed out by her senpais, Maki thanks them by helping Nozomi come out of her shell as well, and she made Nico out of all people cry. Her personality is also very similar to mine, as a withdrawn socially awkward yet passive aggressive sasser who isn't afraid to look down on you if you piss her off. I also share some frustrations she has when it comes to songwriting, for I am a songwriter myself, and I also say \"what the fuck was that\" a lot. \\n\\n\r\nHonk: Honk is one of the more well written genki lead characters, due to the fact that her genkiness isn't one dimensional nor predictable. Her genkiness isn't always positive, as some of the time it's actually her own selfishness, and her overly determined nature actually ends up damaging her relationship with her friends. Honk isn't the perfect happy go lucky person she appears to be, as she is almost constantly internally conflicted and ends up coming off as an asshole more often than not due to her selfishness. Of course, Honk isn't the most consistent character, as her IQ switches between 1 and 100 constantly, but she's definitely deeper than what people give her credit. What makes her relatable in this regard is that she means well, and most of the time doesn't even know she's selfish. This also creates GREAT conflict drama between her, Kotori, and Umi, as Honk's characterization isn't just due to her own characteristics, but also her two closest friends.\\n\\n\r\nKotori: Kotori comes off as your typical airhead deredere, except she does what no other deredere is capable of doing: absolutely destroying her best friend's feelings. Her tendency to spoil Honoka is seen as cliche by many, for many think it's cause she's too nice of a character, but it's actually her own selfishness that is causing her to be so nice. Her refusal to hurt her friend's feelings isn't just cause she wants the best for her, but because she is too conflicted and unwilling to break bad news. Due to her selfish refusal of doing the right thing, her niceness actually ends up hurting Honoka even more than she could ever have imagined. Kotori is seen depressed more than people think, and her habit of putting on a deredere demeanor isn't because she cares, but because of her own flaws and conflicts.\\n\\n\r\nUmi: Umi on the other hand is the opposite of Kotori. She calls Honk out on her bullshit constantly, and her tough love is a turn off to many. People view her as a sociopath due to her constant bullying of Honoka, but due to being brought up by Asian parents, I see the true intent behind Umi's savage nature. Umi's anger and unstable emotions show me that Umi probably loves her friends more than anyone else. She isn't afraid to completely fuck someone up if it's for their own good. Of course, since Umi is a hardcore dandere, she can have her fair share of selfish moments, but in the end, no one gives more shits than Umi does, even if it looks like she's gives no shits about your feelings.\\n\\n\r\nEli: A phenomenally multi dimensional character, a lot of flaws surrounding Eli are actually the story's fault. Eli is the ultimate cockblock in the beginning, and boy did I hate her. This made her redemption as a character all the more heartfelt, as I ended up loving Eli by the end. While the story portrayed her as a stern white knight, who's reasons for despising Muse is due to her lack of confidence in them when it comes to saving the school, it eventually became clear that Eli's distaste actually stems from her stubbornness and pride. As an ex-professional dancer, she views Muse's activities as mere games and looks down upon them constantly. The flaw behind her eventual opening up is that the members of Muse were way too lenient with her. This bitch thinks y'all are trash and you're gonna forgive her just like that? Yeah. Again, this isn't due to Eli's character, this is due to Season One's atrocious writing.\\n\\n\r\nNozomi: Nozomi takes the spotlight as one of the easiest characters to like, both from a characteristic and development stand point. She's the smug mastermind. Her Washi washi may turn off a lot of people, but hey, the author is a Yuri author. Cut her some slack. What made Nozomi even more likeable was when her past was revealed. Nozomi used to be extremely shy, contrary to her extremely calculative nature we see now. Her friendship with Eli and their close bond is what caused Nozomi to transform into what she is now, and that's just a testament to the canon ship that is NozoEli. Seeing Nozomi open up to the rest of Muse and allowing her true shy nature to slip in once in a while humanizes her exponentially.\\n\\n\r\nNico: Nico is the most controversial character. Very rarely do you see someone who thinks Nico is \"alright.\" Nico will usually find herself on the very bottom or the very top of people's rankings. I'm one of the latter, Nico is one of my best girls, but my reasons for liking this monstrosity is different from most people. My reason doesn't just boil down to \"she's funny\" or \"she's a meme.\" First of all, let's be honest: Nico is a fucking piece of shit human being. She's the type of person you'd block on all social media outlets. A real life Nico would have no friends, and I learned that the hard way. You see, Nico is a character that chased her dreams with everything she had, and failed. She didn't fail because \"the world is unfair.\" No, Nico deserved to fail. Nico failed because she failed to see how selfish she was, pushing people beyond their limits without them wanting to. She failed because being a school idol is a team effort and she only thought of herself. The reason she failed is nobody's fault but her own. As someone who's been chasing their dreams for ages, experiencing failure after failure and blaming it on the world, only to slowly realize that I'm the one who's failing myself, seeing this part of Nico made me cry. Not gonna lie, this side of Nico destroyed me. It didn't help that when I was younger, I was also very foul mouthed and hot tempered. I'm one of those real life Nicos. Nico's shitty personality persisted throughout the series, such as lying to her siblings to make her look good and disrespecting the rest of Muse. That's because leaving behind your selfish self is hard. Extremely hard. Nico's flaws lasted all the way till the end of the series, and hell, she was still an annoying shitter at the end, but that's cause this is realism. People don't change at the drop of the hat, and some people don't change at all, but Nico still accepted it and tried to change till the very end. Nico's determination is honestly inspiring, and that drew me to her character as well.\\n\\n\r\nNico is one badass motherfucker.\\n\\n\r\nA cast full of characters that naturally clash with each other, yet even so, they grow with each other to the point where every single character is irreplaceable. The characters bicker with each other constantly, yet their contrasting personalities somehow work with each other. In fact, the characters themselves realize that their drastically different personalities are what make them stand out from other idol groups, and it is because of how irreplaceable every single member of \u03bc's is that causes them to disband their group at the end of the series.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation:\\n\\n\r\nCG is distracting, and while Love Live\u2019s CG is much better than your typical anime, it\u2019s still, well, distracting. This is especially so during some concert scenes when it rapidly switches between 2d and 3d animation. However, I\u2019ve witnessed some horrible CG in my life, so I grew to appreciate Love Live\u2019s relatively tolerable CG. The 2d animation and art during the actual show isn\u2019t very impressive either. While the character designs by themselves are goofy in their own way and eventually grew on me, the animation and art quality is very inconsistent, ranging from pretty good to downright despicable at times. This is especially apparent during scenes where the camera zooms out, and the characters become barely recognizable sketches, with weirdly scaled facial features and bodies. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing that Love Live excels at however are the facial expressions. These goddamn facial expressions are golden, and are used to support both comedic and serious situations. There is a lot of emotion behind these facial expressions, and you can tell what a character is thinking just by looking at their face. You can tell when Eli is done with someone\u2019s bullshit just by looking at her unamused stare. Even the characters are able to react to situations based on another character\u2019s facial expression, such as Kotori constantly wrecking Umi in cards due to Umi\u2019s lack of a poker face, or Nico knowing that her boobies are in for a rough time due to Nozomi\u2019s rape face. The majority of Honk\u2019s silly nature is expressed through her facial expressions, such as her seal clapping and her amazing expression after getting flicked in the forehead by Nico. You can also see the build up before someone starts breaking down into tears, first by their obvious attempts at holding back the tears, until finally you are greeted with the ugliest crying face ever.\\n\\n\r\nMusic:\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes the music in Love Live unique is that only people who watched the show will probably listen to the music. Idol music is very niche and before watching Love Live, I wasn\u2019t into idol music whatsoever. I thought it was too simple and too cringey. While I still think that way about most idol music, there are a few songs that I actually listen to a decent amount nowadays, and not because they are different from the usual idol music in the show, but because of the context behind the pieces.\\n\\n\r\nSongs like Snow Halation and START DASH!! didn\u2019t appeal to me by themselves, but once I witnessed the context behind those two pieces in the show, I started to like them. Also, Love Live uses its idol music in ways that if you like the show and the story, you will like the music. Stuff such as using the OP theme of the first season as the encore for \u03bc's\u2019s \u201cfinal\u201d concert, and using Aishiteru Banzai, a song we heard in the first episode and a personal fave of mine, as the graduation music in the final episode of Season 2. Love Live puts a lot of emotional connection to a lot of would-be average songs, and that\u2019s what makes Love Live\u2019s music memorable in the end. \\n\\n\r\nReflection:\\n\\n\r\nLove Live is bad and you should feel bad, but feeling bad has never felt so good. Easily one of the most satisfying series I\u2019ve ever watched, Love Live fulfills a lot of simple wishes, such as seeing a group of friends start from humble beginnings and becoming international stars, seeing even the coldest of bitches open their hearts to become lovable characters, stuff like that. Stuff that has been done over and over again, but for some reason you especially want it to happen to these 9 girls. And then after an emotional scene, they bring it full circle with the first song you ever hear. Stuff like that makes the first time watching it unforgettable, and makes the first time rewatching it that much more spectacular. \\n\\n\r\nAt least, that\u2019s what happened to me. Not everyone will experience the same things I did, in fact, most of you probably won\u2019t. However, Love Live is definitely one of those shows that has the possibility of changing your life. When you ask for better or worse, I\u2019d probably have to lean towards the latter, for some people then fall into the idol hell known as School Idol Festival, and I hear that there is no escaping that place. And even if you don\u2019t get your life changed, at least you indulged in some top quality memes.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR:\\n\\n\r\nStory: Love Live sucks balls, way too sappy and melodramatic. However, it eventually drops this and becomes a passage of time anime to the likes of K-On, and the drama becomes more natural with positive outcomes. \\n\r\nCharacters: Waifus? Memes? Why not both? A cast of characters that constantly clash with each other, yet eventually become a team where every member feels irreplaceable.\\n\r\nArt: CG. And shitty artwork when the camera zooms. Other than that, it\u2019s ok, and the facial expressions make everything daijoubu. \\n\r\nMusic: Will either make you cringe or cry a river of tears, especially once you know the context behind some of the songs.\\n\\n\r\nIndividual Ratings:\\n\r\nLove Live! School Idol Project: 4/10\\n\r\nLove Live! School Idol Project 2nd Season: 7/10\\n\r\nLove Live! The School Idol Movie 7/10\\n\\n\r\nMy favorite part of the show: Characters.\\n\r\nMy least favorite part of the show: How they handled the drama in season 1.\\n\r\nAnd of course, order of grills (Keep in mind that I like all of them):\\n\r\nUmi > Honk > Nico > Kotori > Eli > Maki > Rin > Nozomi > Hanayo.\\n\\n\r\nFun fact! The Love Live franchise as a whole, including Sunshine, has like zero consistency in terms of clothing. Characters randomly change outfits mid scene.\\n",

            "content": "Full of mirth and passion! Love Live! made me grin from root to seed and had me anticipated about something   other than food.  Yes, I swear by my marmalade that that is true.\r\nSound- 9 out of 10\r\nSince this is an idol anime, the music and the sound are one of its crucial parts.  Well, how should I put it- the music gave me happy vibes.  I was compelled to jump up and dance around my room every time one of the songs came up, and they are idol songs, which is a little bit strange.  First off, I feelthat a lot of idol songs are \"meh\"; uninteresting, shallow, are so passionate and remarkable that they are out of my league, even if the singers are only a few years older than me.  How would you know what a great future feels like, when you are a newbie and most of your happiness is superficial? That was the thing.  The songs in this anime weren't superficial. They were wonderful and realistic, and made me feel like I could relate to them.  Secondly, the voice acting was vewy vewy cute, and the way the characters sang the songs made it convincing that they were the ones singing the song.  The BGM was punctual, and the OST was very satisfying.  So, this anime already fulfills the sound category.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation: 9 out of 10\\n\r\nThe art is fantastic!  It is nothing close to moe- not all of the characters are flat-chested, but there is no ecchi-type fanservice either.  For the concerts, the outfits were very fashionable and stylish.  The companies also gave the characters day to day outfits, besides their school uniform.  Colorful and energetic gym outfits, simple yet sophisticated night clothes- sometimes their hairdos changed!  The animation was varied and very steady.  However, there is one complaint that I had.  Was there 3-d animation in the dance sequences?  It certainly looked like there was.  Now, you're probably wondering, \"What was wrong with the 3-d?\" Hehe, nothing; I'm just kind of sentimental toward them.  The 3-d had perfect timing with the regular animation, and there was nothing inconsistent about them; I just feel awkward about CGs unless it's Disney Pixar.  I'm sorry!\\n\\n\r\nStory- 9 out of 10\\n\r\n\"Otonokizaka High School has recently had a status quo of lesser high school students willing to enroll in it.  Due to this, it is going to close once all the current students have graduated.  A group of girls are against this, and so they all want to do something to prevent it from closing.  What do they decide to do? Become school idols to attract popularity to it!\"  As you can see right now, this plot is nothing out of the box and typical for a slice-of-life and music anime.  On the other hand, that is not all it is.  The characters face actual and realistic problems obstructing the path of their goal, and at times they don't get what they expected.  While watching this anime, I never felt that their successes were patronized, and that their hopeless incidents were not dire enough.  I was always anxious about what would happen next, and felt that the resolution was wrapped up nicely after I finished watching it.  Oh, and how I was sad about finishing it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9 out of 10\\n\r\nThis was probably the most enjoyable aspect of Love Live! for me.  Honoka was a really passionate, energetic girl who reminded me once again that hard work pays off.  Umi-chan acted like the elderly sister for Honoka and Kotori when they first started becoming school idols, setting a work schedule for them and checking if they were still following their diet.  Honoka tackles every problem that comes in her way with a fiery spirit, yet she still has her flaws like everybody else.  The characters developed throughout the series, and they were all especially likeable, even if Nico did annoy me sometimes.  The characters upheld the spirit and passion in this anime, and each episode never failed to bring a smile to my face.  They shall forever remain in my girly heart, Amen.\\n\\n\r\nI'll tell you right now: if you didn't enjoy this show in any aspect, then you can never become a fairy, even if you do save your virginity until age 40.  Who wouldn't smile once during this show?  After I finished Love Live!, I cried out with the same devotion that Joan of Arc had bellowed for Jesus before she was finally reduced to ashes.  I cannot tell anyone how spritely I felt during this endearing viewing session, and if I will ever have the same feeling again for any other idol anime I watch.  FINALE  \\n",

            "content": "Many teenagers dream of their high school life as being the best years of their life. There they meet friends who's friendships they keep dear, discover what they honestly want to do with their lives, and to chase their dreams.\r\nBut what if all of this was taken away from you?\r\nThis is exactly what happens to our main protagonist Kousaka Honoka as she fights to keep her high school dream alive. \r\nThis is my review of the anime hit series: Love Live! School Idol Project\r\n - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Story] - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThis story starts off with the decision that Otonokizaka High School will be closed due to lack of new student applications. Honoka, upon hearing this gets depressed as she wont be able to fully live her high school dream to its full potential as there will be never be any new students/friends to enter the school again. Honoka does not want this to happen and decides that she; with the help of her 2 friends Umi and Kotori will be the ones that save the school from closing. To fulfill this task, she must find a way to attract the attention and influence teens to join her school. How will she do that? Well, what attracts students more then new school pop idols?! Thus, the school idol group 'Muse' was born.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, I felt hesitant when I first approached this anime. I was never really interested in idol genre because generally the music played in them I felt were all generic and too cliche. If I were not to stumble over a Reddit post showing how 'Long Live! School Idol Project' sold a tremendous amount of copies its first week, I might have never came across this anime..  but i'm really glad I did.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough this genre generally has a bad name in terms of plot, this anime executes it quite nicely. This story was interesting because it felt relatable as it touches on many themes that we face in our everyday life such as hard work, perseverance, and the dreams we hold dear. As a student that is still in high school currently, I feel that I have dealt with these themes myself at least once in my high school life, which makes the story even more reassuring as I can relate to it and its characters as a student/viewer. Even though these themes aren't elaborated as much as I wish they did, it was still great to see that this anime contained an interesting plot, and how we can learn from this story as opposed to the usual cute girls doing cute things because well... you know... they're cute. Not that i'm opposed to that, as sometimes those can be a good watch when your in the mood. (Please don't kill me moe army.)\\n\\n\r\n[Art] - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe overall art style of this anime is above average. For a show created in 2013, I've seen some of our current year anime's with lower quality art then this.That is definitely reassuring as there's no drop in quality and is quite balanced in terms of quality distribution throughout the anime. During the live shows, the dance scenes are super cute, and ultimately provide for a nice viewing experience that never ceased to stop me from watching these scenes with a slight smile. It also impressed me on how they change the art style when the live shows happen. They turn all of the idols into 3 dimensional characters instead of the usual 2D throughout the anime. I felt that this was a very cool change and implemented a stronger impact during the live scenes as it always got me excited whenever they decided to perform.\\n\\n\r\n[Sound] - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nFor an anime that prides itself on being in the idle genre, I expected there to be tons of new and exciting songs that would keep me interested throughout the story. I wasn't disappointed. The music they sang were lively and spirited. It really got me pumped up when they started singing, and the live performances never ceased to stop me from humming along with the tune. The idol's voices were beautiful and strong as well, that managed to leave an impact on me with the resonant songs they sang.  I felt the songs that they sang were always full of fun, and you could tell that they were originally made too as it didn't seem too professional but also not too amateurish as well. An example of this would be this series opening \"Bokura wa Ima no Naka de\" by non other then 'Muse'. I really enjoyed the impact of the opening of this song. The tune is extremely catchy and I often found myself humming along with the opening as each episode began. Overall I was quite impressed with the music in this anime, as it was something that made this anime stand out and shine. (Something people can't really say about all Idle anime today, as some of them don't really focus on the music part as much anymore)\\n\\n\r\n[Character] - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAll the Idol's found within this anime are all lovable in their own way. They each portray a different quality that makes them somewhat unique. Even though they might be put into a generic archetype, that doesn't mean that it is all there is to them. The thing i'm impressed with, is the amount of character development that our Idols go through. During the beginning of the story, we can definitely tell that these 3 girls did not really look like they were idol material and it certainly didn't feel like they wanted to be one. With hard work and perseverance, they were able to take on this incredible difficult task by setting aside their differences on the topic at hand. The dramatic moments in the story also have a greater impact because we can relate to these characters and situations as we've most likely gone through the same hardships numerous times before. High school life. I feel that many of us have felt the emotions that have come with it far too many times. This helps us feel stronger emotions toward these characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing I felt was problematic, was how the situation played out too perfectly. It seemed that the idea of becoming idols was just a random idea thrown out of the blue from Honoka. Yet, these 3 students who've never even sang on stage, trained professionally as a singer/dancer, and only practiced with no help whatsoever can do it perfectly just like that? Is that all there is to an idol? Probably not. It could be that they just don't want us to think about it too much as it is probably not that big of a deal, but it just kind of left me wondering.\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment/Overall] 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed watching this anime alot. Sure, I did feel kind of embarrassed as this was the first idle anime that I've ever watched, but i'm really glad I did. Now, I'll be less hesitant to try anime like these because some of them are definitely worth watching like this. For all of the people that enjoy idol anime, I would definitely recommend this and to the people who are curious/worried about this anime because of its genre, i'd say give it a shot. I know you can't hate something that you haven't watched, but that goes the same way with anime that you like.",

It bring more classic humor which i loved and from time to time a character will speak in English in different situation. (out of humor of course). no real annoying characters. \r\nFor more information ofwhat I think about this series, look at my blog.\\n\r\n(warning spoilers!)\\n",

            "content": "My first review, yes. With spoilers. Please keep in mind that this review may NOT be organized, or properly done, or came from a weird perspective.\r\nLove Live! School Idol Project is obviously about school idols and stuff. This is the first anime I've watched in the school idol genre. And I can say I liked it. eh.\r\nSo let's start. :o\r\nStory: 8\r\nThe story is quite normal and simple: \"Plz prevent school shut down\". And the students are getting worked up on finding possible 'solutions' to prevent it from happening. Kousaka Honoka sees an idol group and decides to make one.\r\nAs the story progresses, the focus onsome characters are being lost. *spoilers* *spoilers* At first it was only the trio. I loved it since that part. Actually could've been better if they remained as 3. (which means more character exposure).\\n\r\nAlso timeskips exist. \"Last week's episode: 123123 months away from Event X. Today's episode: 2 days away from Event X\". Well, yes I'm exaggerated it, but I believe you get my point. (?)\\n\r\nAlso, some of these problems arise (A-RISE) when half of the season is over (e.g. Kotori leaving the country)\\n\r\nSome events happen unexpectedly (dropping out, Kotori leaving, Eri Ayase), and some are seen coming (getting sick, not gonna be shut down). Some episodes end abruptly. (beach episode)\\n\r\nThe ending is the typical happy ending, where everything is going bad then Superman comes and saves the day.\\n\r\nAs I expected. Everything I've seen about this anime before I watched it gave me the feeling that \"this anime won't end sad, there's no way\". Well except Madoka though, it gave me a false impression. \\n\r\nI also like how they provide little to no fanservice at all. \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR : Story\\n\r\nJust like life. Ups and downs occur everywhere.\\n\r\nIt's good as it is simple. I still enjoyed the story, given some 'flaws' I found.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\\n\r\nEh. While all of the characters have unique characteristics to them, things come up just abruptly.\\n\r\nWe can see that some characters have some 'things' about/of them that count as information for the character\\n\r\nSome characters don't have those 'things'. Oh yeah, we know that they are X's friend/Student Council VP/Pro-archer, but anything else, naaah. Also, are the members of the group born-talented or something? Some characters aren't shown singing or have an interest in dancing but shows good performance otherwise.I guess the motivation the group provides is quite great that everyone learns in a few days. Whatever. My POV anyway.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR : Characters\\n\r\nEveryone is unique, yet some lack background.\\n\\n\r\nSound : 10\\n\\n\r\nOh yes. u's' music is what made me watch this anime. I've been hearing u's' music in the game \"osu!\" and I can say that I liked their songs. Their songs are happy (usually more than 180BPM i think), and are really catchy. The one I found I liked the most was \"Bokura no LIVE Kimi to no LIFE\". That song is the shiet. o/. Their music is good, great or even splendid.\\n\r\nThe voice actors/seiyuu did a good job (for me). I liked Nozomi and Maki's voice for an unknown reason. All other characters' voices are fine. Though I find that (very little) Kotori's and Rin's voices quite annoying. Dunno. \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR : Sound\\n\r\nI love their music. And the actors' voices.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\\n\r\nAnother reason why I watched this anime. The art. I liked how they do the faces,  though given that they are not very unique. The color schemes are okay. Another big factor was the animation used for the PVs. Though running at somewhere at 15-20FPS, it was eyecandy. I never took my eyes of the screen when they're performing. I also like how they do the faces when the characters are frustrated or getting, uh. done by Nozomi. Yes. :3.\\n\\n\r\nThe surroundings are nothing special. Could be the typical.\\n\r\nSo yeah. Art is great.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR : Art\\n\r\nAwsum animation. Especially the PVs. Beautiful art style. Aaaa I love it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime from the part where Honoka acted like 'aaa just a dream nothing to worry about'.\\n\r\nIf I find things like an anime that is interesting, I will watch it. This has piqued my interest long ago.\\n\r\nThe part I enjoyed the most were the PVs, and the 'sad' parts. They make you want to find out what's going to happen after this event and etc. Overall, I enjoyed it. It's K-ON but only with school idols, no instruments, and more members (and the situation that you dropped out from a contest and your school is going to be shut down soon)\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: Enjoyment\\n\r\nEnjoyed it. :o Very.\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah. First noob review conducted. Looking forward to season 2.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\n46/50 = 92%\\n\r\nI'm used to giving high scores. Eh. GG.\\n",

            "content": "When asked, a lot of people don't like idol anime or anything similar, or in other words, anime based on music and stuff. I'm one of these people. I don't usually watch idol anime, but I wanted to try this out because of the outstanding art that this anime offers.\r\nAt first I was really hesitant, even to the point where I removed it off my PTW list because I would feel embarrassed having watched something like this. Sure this anime might be targeted towards children rather than teens/adults, but it doesn't mean that teens/adults wouldn't enjoy this. This anime taught to me that hard workactually does pay off, that if you try your hardest, you will eventually arrive to your destination point. \\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of things I liked about this anime, but the thing I liked most was probably the art. Yes, I'm a very picky person when it comes to art, and this anime reached my expectations when it came to the art. All the characters were nicely designed and all of the 9 girls are cute. In other words, the art was what some people call it, flawless.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing I disliked about this anime was the fact that they were taking too long to prepare for the live shows and stuff like that. The producers should have shown the girls in action more (I don't literally mean in action, I meant that they should probably have shown more of their songs).\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of characters, all of them are easily likable, none of them are really that bland. There are 3 main characters in this anime, Honoka, who is seriously hyper and energetic, Umi who is very shy and was reluctant to become a school idol at first, and Kotori who is a very calm, and a little shy. \\n\\n\r\nWe have these 3 main characters make an school idol group in order to save the school from closing (because they aren't reaching the applicant quota). They name this school idol group 'Muse' (sorry I don't want to look all over the internet just for a greek character). Eventually they reach 9 members by around episode 6-9, forgot. That's basically it for the story since I don't want to spoil a lot.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is the second thing I enjoyed a lot in this anime. The opening was just straight up amazing, I almost watched it every episode. I don't usually watch endings because they're usually dull and boring, but I really loved the ending song this time, I ended up watching it every episode. The insert songs were amazing too, I ended up downloading that 'Dash' song too (it was that good :>).\\n\\n\r\nI could probably say that I felt embarrassed inside while watching the first few episodes due to this being my first idol anime, but eventually I got used to the feeling and I opened myself up to this anime. All in all I could say that I enjoyed this anime a lot for my first idol anime, and I would suggest this to anyone who is looking for an idol anime.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading :>\\n\r\n- Peten00b",

            "content": "Trashy Pandas \t\tLove Live! School Idol Project Review\t\t\tMay 22, 2014\r\n*THIS ONLY CONTAINS THE FIRST SEASON I WILL EVENTUALLY GET AROUND TO WRITING THE REVIEW FOR THE ENTIRE SERIES BUT SCHOOL IS TAKING UP ALL OF MY TIME*\r\n\u201cDatte kanosei kanjitanda. Sou da susume. Kokai shitaku nai me no mae ni bokura no michi ga aru.\u201d\r\n\u201cI feel we have a chance. Yes let's push forward. I don't want to regret it later. Our future lies right ahead.\u201d from the song Susume by Muse. \r\n\tHope. Desires. Goals. Perseverance. Friendship. Love. Music. The girls of the school idol group Muse share all of these wonderful things as they giveit their all to be a part of the most popular event for high school idol groups: Love Live. The nine girls strive to save their school from closing by trying to attract perspective students through the formation of a school idol group that, they hope, will one day be a part of Love Live. Honoka Kousaka leads her group of eight other cute, talented high school friends towards Love Live. The anime Love Live! School Idol Project has become my #1 favorite anime because of the wonderful, loveable, and memorable characters, the outstanding animation style, and, most importantly, the best, most addictive, and energetic soundtrack, which all culminate into one amazing story of friendship, love, hope, and music. \\n\\n\r\nI Plot\\n\r\n\tThe plot for Love Live! Is very straight forward, easy to follow, and enjoyable. The story goes as anyone would expect after watching the first episode: the main character and her friends work to save their school from closing by trying to attract new students by gaining popularity through the formation of a school idol group which becomes known as \u201cMuse\u201d. This formula is followed for most of the story, however there are several complications that are not expected and some twists. I'm not going to spoil it, even though this is a review. While being not very complex, the plot forms a solid foundation for the anime, is consistently present, and keeps the story progressing. There is not much else to say without spoiling the twists and turns. The plot fits well and proves fairly interesting. \\n\\n\r\nII Romance?\\n\r\n\tThere are no \u201cofficial\u201d romances in Love Live!, however, there are subtle and clear hints at possible relationships that could be. My favorite of the possible romances is Honoka x Maki. Honoka is the energetic, lively leader of Muse while Maki is very level-headed and reserved. I love the contrast that would make their relationship work like a charm. Other than this, there are no relationships to expand on, you just get enjoyment from shipping the girls together. \\n\\n\r\nIII Theme\\n\r\n\tThe main theme of Love Live! Is never give up despite how impossible the road ahead may seem and always remember that your friends are there with you every step of the way. Friends are there to stick with you through thick and thin, good and bad weather, shit storms and double rainbows. Also, be aware of your friends and their feelings. Another key part of the theme is to never give up on your dreams. No matter how many setbacks and roadblocks are in the way, the prize at the end of the road is worth the experiences that are encompassed by the journey. The theme is not much more complex than this. \\n\\n\r\nIV Animation and Art Style\\n\r\n\tThe animation for Love Live! Is mind-blowingly amazing. For the most part, the animation and art is in 2D, but when the girls put on their performances, the animation switches over to 3D character models for exciting, energetic dance routines. Starting with the 2D aspect, the girls have extremely cute, distinguishing physical appearances. I love the designs for the girls' eyes; the eyes are realistically proportioned and detailed. The girls' bodies are realistic and resemble what actual high school girls would look like, i.e. they don't have obnoxiously large breasts and overly exaggerated sexual features except Nozomi, who has large breasts but not to the point that it's the only thing the viewer cares about or notices. I love that the girls aren't sexualized like in a lot of anime such as Sekirei or High School DxD; I feel the anime would have been totally different if that were the case. As for the surroundings and environment, it's pretty standard. NOW, for the 3D animation. Wow, wow, this hits it out of the ballpark: 3D song and dance routines that will make you sit in awe while watching these amazingly cute girls have the time of their lives. I wish that there were a lot more of these, but I highly doubt the animation budget could have incorporated them. Still, I digress, the 3D animation makes a massive impact on the viewers and is just spectacular. \\n\\n\r\nV Characters\\n\r\n\tThe characters in Love Live! Are some of  my favorite characters of all time because of how unique, well designed, and beautiful they are. Honoka Kousaka, the protagonist, is an extremely lively, spontaneous, and strong willed girl who will do anything to achieve her dreams. Honoka forms Muse with her friends, Umi and Kotori before reaching out to get more girls to help with reaching their goal. Honoka is so lovable; she is so determined to do everything she can to keep her school from being closed down. There isn't anything bad to say about her.  Umi Sonoda, one of Honoka's best friends from childhood, is a very calm, sensible, and serious girl who does archery at the high school while being a part of Muse. Umi is very talented with poetry and has superb writing skills; she writes mostly all of the lyrics for Muse's songs. Umi is just as determined as Honoka, but a lot more forceful when it comes to accomplishing things. She is a very lovable and is attractive in as a strong female character. Kotori Minami, who is my favorite character and my #1 waifu, is probably  THE most  adorable character I've ever seen. I love her hairstyle; it's a champagne blonde color, sort of more ash colored (I don't know how to adequately describe the various shades of hair color). The way she wears it is straight down in the back with a shoulder length pony tail that is combined into a folding thing. I don't know how to describe it, but it's absolutely adorable (look it up on google images). Kotori is a very shy girl who loves her friends, and the members of Muse, more than anything. The other members of Muse are Eri Ayase, Nico Yazawa, Nozomi Tojo, Maki Nishikino, Hanayo Koizumi, and Rin Hoshizora. Eri is the leader of the high school's student council; she was apposed to the idea of Muse, but ended up joining and loving the experience. Eri is very kind, hardworking, earnest, and the best dancer in Muse. Nico Yazawa was the head of the School Idol Research Club at the school, who had previously been a part of the school's former  idol group. She is extremely passionate about the group's success and wants more than anything for Muse to be a part of Love Live. She is a very tsundere-esque character but has a very sweet side that makes up for the annoying side. Nozomi Tojo is the manipulative student council vice president who indirectly helps Honoka form Muse. Nozomi also gives Muse it's name. Nozomi is very rational and the most caring member of the group; she sees deep into the other characters' feelings and does whatever she can to help them out. But she loves boobs, a lot... she grabs the other characters' breasts all the time.  Maki, is the beautiful girl with dark red hair whose musical talent exceeds anything that I could ever hope to do. She is an amazing composer and does most of the work to set Umi's lyrics to a dynamic, lively tune. Similar to Umi, she is very reserved and has a lot of trouble being open with the other girls of Muse. Maki is a genius whose family wants her to become a medical doctor and inherit the family's hospital. Hanayo Koizumi is one of the three first years who is Muse's biggest fan before she joins the group. She is the most shy girl of them all who share's Nico's obsession with school idols and Love Live. Hanayo has a very kind heart, but I don't think she has a whole lot of depth from what I remember. Rin Hoshizora is the last first year and Hanayo's best friend from their childhood. Rin has the same liveliness as Honoka and has that cat-like cuteness that some anime characters have: the cute cat smile, high pitched and playful voice. Again she doesn't have a ton of depth but I still love her character as much as all of the others'. \\n\\n\r\nVI Music\\n\r\n\tThe soundtrack for Love Live! Is just... I... I don't have a large enough, or refined enough vocabulary to do the music justice. Spirited, lively, energetic, peppy, bubbly, and beautiful is the best way for me to explain the music. I'm not a musical expert, I play bass guitar a little bit, and I love the music. The girls have the most gorgeous, beautiful, resonant voices that I've ever heard and I can't get enough of hearing all nine of these adorable girls sing. Each song is so full of energy that I want to start dancing with them, even though I'm a guy. On another note, I mainly listen to heavy metal, thrash metal, metalcore, hard rock, and classic rock but I love Muse's songs just as much as I love AC/DC, Metallica, Iron Maiden, Megadeth, Avenged Sevenfold, and Disturbed. If that doesn't say something about how amazing these girls are, then I don't know what does. The lyrics aren't as shallow as I thought they would be. The lyrics aren't very deep at the same time, but it's not easy to have deep lyrics for a peppy school idol group and keep the songs and performance entertaining and lively, now is it. I regret my lack of musical expertise and knowledge of musical jargon; I can't give Muse's musical talent the justice it deserves, so please go and check out the songs available on YouTube or watch the anime yourself so you can experience this amazing work of art. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\n\tI give Love Live! School Idol Project an 11/10 for its beyond outstanding ability to spread cheerfulness, the amazing and lovable characters, the jaw dropping animation sequences and the spectacular music. Love Live! Receives the Pandas Seal of Approval, a gold medal, and the #1 spot on my top ten favorite anime list. I would highly recommend this to anyone, of any age, because of how open it is to everyone. The second season is currently airing and episode 8 is scheduled to be released within the upcoming week.",

            "content": "\"Love Live! School Idol Project\", I have never fully watched any idol series before, so this one was my first, and I ended up enjoying it a lot. I've tried to watch IdolM@ster when it first aired, but I just couldn't get into it. I watched Love Live after it was finished airing. I honestly don't know why I decided to watch Love Live, but I'm so glad I did.\r\nStory\r\nThere was a clear story, which was good. School is gonna get shut down if they don't get enough students, Honoka (main character) decides to become school idols to stop the school from closing. The storywas simple, and I didn't have any problems with the pacing. Throughout the show, they include showing what the characters need to endure to become idols which include stamina, vocal, and dance training. I thought that this was a nice toutch to include and helped with character development quite well\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation\\n\r\nI liked the overall art style, which fit the mood of this series, it was bright and colorful. But the one thing that I didn't like was the CG's. Luckily, they were only used during the insert songs and in the opening. They didn't use CG's for the whole song either, it switched between several times, sometimes, the CG wasn't too noticeable, which is why I didn't mind it too much. The animation looked smooth and was very well executed. No complaints about animation. I loved the choreography during the songs, sometimes, I had to rewatch one of the performances twice. Once to focus on the song, and another to look at the choreography.\\n\\n\r\nSound/Music\\n\r\nBeing an idol anime, I guess I kinda expected good music. I am glad to say that I was not disappointed. All of the songs were catchy, memorable and fit the situation very well. Even the background music stood out to me (in a good way). It always fit with the events that happened and set the tone of whats gonna happen. The opening song was amazing, I never skipped it, not a single time. The ending song was the same, never wanted to skip it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nEach character had a very different personality and were all likeable in their own way. There weren't any characters that I hated. I found that I could summarize the personalities of the characters in just a few words, which isn't necessarily bad. The characters had a very human like mindset in my opinion, which enhanced the drama scenes in the show.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\nI really liked this anime and am glad that I gave it a go. I have never fully watched an idol anime before this one. When I was watching, I was completely immersed in the show. I never felt bored or wanted to skip over a scene during the show. The music was amazing, I cannot stress that enough. If you haven't watched this, I highly recommend that you give it a shot.",

            "content": "So, you want to become a superstar? \r\nIt's not easy. In fact, it takes more than just skill. It takes the will, determination, support, technique, integrity, and a little bit of luck to reach success. In fact, reaching that point of success is especially hard when there's competition. Among other things, being an idol also means to shine and make yourself a name in the industry. You have to embrace what you do and no matter what, always aim for success. \r\nAt least, that's what the girls at Otonokizaka High School wishes to do...\r\nAlright, this series known as Love Live! School Idol Project is actuallyan anime project co-produced with the music company Lantis Co., Ltd and studio Sunrise being involved. Not many people may know of the franchise but it already has achieved success in other fields of music CDS. Well, success doesn't come easy like I mentioned before and in this series, it definitely is something that's hard to achieve. \\n\\n\r\nAt first I was skeptical whether to check out this series or not. I mean, there are so many idol themed series already in the anime industry. Hell, even this Winter season of 2013, there is not one (Akb4OO8 Next Stage) but two (Akitasu) ongoing series involving music and idols. In fact, I sometimes get bored of watching this stuff because initially, I thought the show would just be about cute girls doing cute things. I wasn't too wrong either especially with our main female protagonist, Honoka Kosaka. \\n\\n\r\nJust look at her, she's a cute little button with a cute little bang on the side of her head along with that bubbly personality.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, beyond that outer image is a girl who is determined to prevent the shutdown of her beloved school. How? Form an idol group of course! But that's a lot easier said than done in reality. The series takes this idea and transform it into a more of a slice-of-life story in the beginning. At first, there's Honoka. Then later comes the rest of the characters, or rather girls who all becomes associated with the group. Oh and the group is called Muse represented by the \"\u03bc's\" symbol. Obviously, it's a reflection of what the group stands for \u2013 a music ensemble of girls who wishes to show the world who they are and make a name for themselves while at the same time to prevent the destruction of their beloved school.\\n\\n\r\nThus, their journey begins...\\n\\n\r\nThe initial episodes (first half of the series) makes prominent highlights of some of the other girls in the series. Among these girls, they all have different personalities. There's the timid girl with the stage freight (Umi Sonoda), the cool chick (Nozomi), the tomboy (Rin Hoshizora), the cold heart (Eli), the gentle girl (Kotori Minami), and the childish (Niko Yazawa). Of course, I'm not naming all the characters here but you get the idea. From the initial premise of becoming superstars, these girls come together. However, I find the first of the episodes in this series to be dull and not done right. In fact, I find most of the girls' backgrounds to be stale and lacks any real characterization besides who they are. Perhaps the lack of a general background with the girls is the weakness here but regardless, the first half of the series is a bit mediocre in my book. Well, thanks to Niko, I did have some fun and enjoyed part of her performance. NIKO-NIKO smile~\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the series becomes more lively later on especially with Honoka. I will say right now that her mood brightens this series quite a bit and can easily bring a smile to a viewer's eyes. If you're having a bad day, just watch her and that cloud of grayness will brighten. That's probably a weak analogy but her enthusiasm is what unites the group she works so hard to create. In fact, as the unanimous leader of the group, it is up to Honoka to save the school and make a name for themselves with the face of music. Perhaps, I feel she tries too hard though. I mean, in one episode, she particularly puts her own life at risk. It's how hard she tries to bring their ranks together especially when going up against competition. That' s the thing too because when you become a superstar, expect media attention and rivals heading your way. It's a tough, tough world Honoka-chan.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of the series remains weak but simple. It's about a group of girls coming together united as a music group to bring media attention. By becoming idols/superstars, they can spread their names and hopefully with what they can achieve will save their school. As simple as it is though, it is VERY easy to guess who will join Muse. It's not even foreshadowing but rather given directly with the opening song and poster. The series also doesn't avoid the typical \"beach episode\" that seemingly becomes one of those relaxing break. Furthermore, the seemingly focus on the idols themselves rather than what they hope to achieve becomes a backstabber in my opinion to the initial premise. Also, it seems that the competition isn't as intense as it originally looked. \\n\\n\r\nDespite this though, I find the series to be a fun and entertaining watch with a cherry atmosphere. It's nice to see the girls tries so hard on a profession that is extremely difficult to make a name for. But what they're doing it for is not only for themselves but to save their beloved school. Now that my friends is what I call good-hearted. The performance themselves are also quite real and done well. In fact, some of the songs played in many of the episodes has that idol-like feeling. With those cute outfits, personalities, and outfits, these girls really do have what it takes. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of visuals, Sunrise does them. And hey, who knew, they actually pulled a nice one out of their hats this time. From the outfits, character designs, and the way the girls dances, the visuals almost feel like they are coming to life at many occasions. I find this to be quite pleasing and interactive to watch as opposed to some CGI movements or forced movements. No, it's natural and the girls are putting on a live show. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack, music, and voice acting is perhaps the most prominent feature of this series. After all, music is the main feature and premise of Love Live! The sound director, Yukio Nagasaki puts effort through and it's easy to hear and visualize what it's there. Of course, the performance that I mentioned before are also done beautifully. It looks natural, realistic, and the girls have fun doing it. At some occasions, viewers may wish they were right there with them on the stage. Then opening song, \"Bokura wa Ima no Naka de\" by \u03bc's is performed by the idol group themselves and shows to the audience that they're serious about what they do. The many ED songs brings together a collage of various fun tunes featuring different mood settings. It's beautiful~\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this underrated series is worth some time to invest into. In my opinion, this show is charming and so is Muse. Although its initial episodes were like a chore to watch, it later makes it up with the enthusiasm of the group along with the all cheerful Honoka-chan. It's also fun to watch the girls perform and hope that they succeed especially when they see some results on what they worked so hard for. Yup, they are aiming for success but at the same time having fun while doing it. Well, I hope you have fun while you relax, sit back, and enjoy what Muse do their best:\\n\\n\r\nEntertain you.",

            "content": "Unless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, you\u2019ve probably taken note of the rising popularity and plethora of idol related anime in the last few years. Any time I dare venture out to any anime convention that just so happens to be taking place within my proximity, I\u2019m bound to be met with an onslaught of idol related merchandise from body pillows, those strange mouse pads that also have a pair of breasts on them, figures, CDs and even several cosplayers too \u2013 it\u2019s inescapable! However, it\u2019s not necessarily hard to understand why such shows garner such popularity, as they seem to be almost designedto be as marketable as possible. They feature an ensemble of cute girls, of various body types, whether that be the small loli (remember to tell the FBI that she is just a drawing when they come knocking down your door!) all the way to the plump and voluptuous, all the while having distinct personality types to appeal to every demographic of anime fan imaginable. Combine that with the fact that the girls are often made to wear skimpy and risqu\u00e9 outfits with incredibly small miniskirts, and sing generic, catchy pop-songs with their cute mannerisms, makes for a cultural phenomenon! Out of all the various idol anime out there, easily the most prolific and popular is Love Live; a franchise so popular over in Japan that in 2016 it was the highest grossing media franchise of that year, passing One Piece! (Damn, that\u2019s a lot of scantily clad body pillows sold!) Over the last few days, me and a couple of other reviewer friendos decided to watch the entire series (for the most part anyway) all together, and while it was a very enjoyable experience to do so, even if we spent most of the time making fun of the show, I seem to have been left with rather severe PTSD, so much so, that every time I go to close my eyes to sleep at night, visions of each of the girls as they smile and dance appear in front of me. At first, it\u2019s tranquil; calm, but as time moves along the girls become fierce and terrifying, laughing manically as I am trapped in this existential horrific nightmare in which even my own screams of pain and anguish cannot awaken me from the horrors that lay before me. I desperately want to run, to run from the visions, but I\u2019m stuck; frozen in place as the idols slowly consume me and every fibre of my being\u2026\\n\\n\r\nAnywho, with that all said and done, and instead of contacting my closest therapist immediately, let\u2019s form our own idol group, dress up in some revealing clothes whilst dancing and singing on stage, and dive into the world of Love Live!\\n\\n\r\nOtonokizaku High School is on the verge of closing, due a lack of students wanting to partake in studies there, and is set to shut down after the current first year students graduate. As such, our main protagonist, Honoka, in an attempt to prevent the school closing down at all costs, decides to create an idol group, as a way to attract new students into attending said school, thus preventing it from its inevitable closure. The rest of the series sees Honoka recruit new members, as they all practice harder and harder to become great idols, intermixed with a touch of drama here and there. At the very least, Love Live\u2019s set-up allows for some semblance of narrative stakes as the failure of the newly formed idol group, by the name of Muse, will bring an end to the school (even though we know as an audience from the get-go that the characters will succeed since there is nothing presented in the narrative that would suggest otherwise) and it also provides some kind of motivation and drive for the characters in the story. My main criticism of Love Live\u2019s narrative is just how incredibly predictable and safe the entire journey is. It\u2019s the most standard narrative structure one could possibly expect to see, and has been done so many times in so many other shows, that I can guarantee you that you would be able to identify each story beat and event that transpires in the show just by simply reading the plot synopsis presented on MAL. It genuinely feels like that whoever was writing the show, was simply ticking boxes off of things to include within the show. A hyper and energetic girl with good intentions who ropes everyone in and inspires them to try their hardest? TICK. An obligatory beach episode which is used for the purpose of training and seeing each of the girls in skimpy bathing suits? TICK. Drama that is introduced late into the narrative and is used more so to try and make the show seem more emotional than it is, whilst trying to manipulate the audience into feeling something for the characters, which will be ultimately resolved by the final episode leaving in a happy conclusion? TICK. As such, the narrative of Love Live feels tiering; a chore to sit through, as in my head I could easily map out the series and each one of the events that would transpire. It feels less like a journey you embark on with these girls as they try to save their school, and more so like a lecture in which you already know all the content the lecturer is going to go over, and you\u2019re just listing them off in your head, waiting for them to get to the next point.\\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned before, the show does have its share of drama, which I imagine was implemented into the narrative as a way to spice things up; to try and make things interesting, but it just comes across more so forced and trite than anything else, and the juxtaposition between the light-hearted hijinks an episode before, and scenes where everyone is yelling and fighting comes across as so damn jarring! Again, just like the complaints I talked about above about the narrative\u2019s predictability, the drama in the show is foreshadowed in such a way that ignores the very notion of subtlety. After both Umi, Honoka\u2019s friend, and Honoka\u2019s little sister warn her not to overwork herself as she may fall ill, she then decides to go running in the pouring rain like an idiot, develops a fever, and ends up ruining everybody\u2019s hard work as a result. The show expects me to feel sorry for Honoka, since the very reason as to why she developed this fever was because she was working so hard to prevent the school from closing down, but I simply can\u2019t, as the character itself isn\u2019t strong enough to illicit such emotions in me, especially since it\u2019s so typical of these types of shows to go down this route that it leaves no impact on me! There\u2019s even a scene in the show where the drama reaches a point in which Honoka gets bitch-slapped into the Shadow Realm after proclaiming her leaving of the group, whereupon I promptly laughed my ass off for a good ten minutes because I\u2019m an immature dumbass. But, this disconnect from what the show expects me to feel, that is, emotional and probably shock from seeing one of the girls resort to physical violence towards her friend, against what I felt, that is, laughter at a moment where it obviously wasn\u2019t warranted is the reason why I feel nothing for any of the drama they try and throw in the show, and a lot of that has to do with the fact that the characters are simply not strong enough to carry it. There\u2019s just nothing really to sink your teeth into in this show in regards to the story, and, despite what some people may tell you, such as the entire show being inside one of the character\u2019s heads (which would actually be kind of interesting as an idea now that I think about it) there\u2019s nothing really of any substantial merit here (then again, the person who told me that has Eli as his favourite girl, so therefore his claim lacks any weight automatically).\\n\\n\r\nNow, I\u2019ve complained a fair bit about the narrative and why it feels so tiresome and dull, but this mode of storytelling is not necessarily a game breaker for me. I can forgive an anime in regards to its lack of overall narrative, as long as the characters, and the interactions between them are good; it\u2019s the main reason why I liked Azumanga Diaoh after all. In that show, the narrative is simply about a bunch of high school girls whom progress through three years of high school, with them eventually graduating at the end, but the characters are all very likeable, to the point in which we grow attached to them as actual people, and the comedy in the show is strong enough to carry the entire experience. For me, the most important thing in most cases are the characters, since they hold the key to whether or not I care about anything the show prevents me with, and I think if the characters in Love Live were stronger, I could be more forgiving of the narrative and the whole show at large.\\n\\n\r\nMuch like in regards to the story, it felt like the writer constructed the characters in the most safe and predictable way possible, with two exceptions however. I\u2019ve already somewhat alluded to Honoka\u2019s character earlier in the review; she is the girl whom has the most energy, and acts as the driving force for pushing the story forward with her optimistic outlook to any situation and is the one that gathers everyone together, acting as the inspiration for the group through her hardworking attitude. She is not necessarily a bad character, just one that is not that interesting as a whole. As previously mentioned, she does run into some drama near the end of the series, but the small amount of development she embarks on, and character arc in general is still nothing remarkable as a whole. Umi, along with Kotori are best friends with Honoka and we see little snips of their past as children, which gives their characters a little more depth, although, and, again, is nothing to remarkable. They more so play the voice of rationality to Honoka in the series, with Umi being the shy and reserved type, but ultimately firm when the time calls, and Kotori\u2026just being an airhead I guess. Whilst in the latter part of the series, she has to make a decision regarding her future, that being whether to move to America to study costume design, or to stay being a worthless school idol, which then cultivates in some more of that lovely, forced D R A M A that I adore, it feels inconsequential in the long run, since it\u2019s pretty obvious that she will decide to stay with her friends since shows like this have practically programmed me to think as such. \\n\\n\r\nHanoyo and Rin add very little to the overall show and to be perfectly honest, I kind of forgot they were even there half the time. Rin joins the idol group just because Hanoyo does, and while Hanoyo\u2019s reasoning for joining, that being because she wants to grow in confidence is a fine motivation to have, it\u2019s barely developed or explored. Maki serves somewhat more to the overall story, as she can actually play the piano and sing rather well, which is then used for writing music for the group, and her Tsundere-esque personality can actually be kind of cute sometimes. Eli has somewhat more of a backstory than the rest of the girls, being that she was actually a ballet dancer in the past, which is then used to help the rest of the group and Noizoimi is one of the better characters, being as she has the most voluptuous body, and sexually harasses the other girls by grabbing their tits (if that\u2019s not a well crafted character, then I don\u2019t know what is). Nozomi takes on more of a mother role in the series, often dishing out random nuggets of wisdom to the girls whenever they\u2019re in need of some, and that\u2019s it as a whole. The characters in Love Live, for the most part, are extremely weak and cookie-cutter, so much so, that I\u2019m struggling to even find anything to say about them. The only fun character in the entire show is Nico, and, yes, I understand at this point she is one giant meme, but she is the only character who has some semblance of a personality. She is an aspiring wannabe ideal, constantly switching between her idol persona, that being the adorably sweet Nico, with the catchphrase \u201cNICO NICO NII!!\u201d which me and everyone repeated so much during our watch that my PTSD is triggered every time I hear it. She\u2019s like an antagonist in a way; the various things she does to try and prove that she is better than everyone else at various idol related things always blows up in her face, leading to some of the more entertaining aspects of the show (I also like to imagine to myself that Nico is a trap; a thought that brings me nothing but happiness).\\n\\n\r\nThe characters and their interactions are just fine as a whole. There are times when the chemistry between them does work, most strongest being during the beach episode I made fun of earlier since the girls are just messing around with each other (and Nico gets hit right in the goddam face with a beach ball so that\u2019s always a plus), leading into some genuinely charming and funny scenes, particularly thanks to Nico as I just mentioned before, but the show really needed a stronger cast of characters to really pull itself together. That\u2019s not to say that the entire show is without merit however. There were some scenes that I felt were kinda alright, such as in episode three, when, after the girls put all their efforts into practising for their first idol performance, and when the curtains go up to perform, they are greeted with only a few people rather than the full room like they were expecting, but despite that, they perform on anyway. Some of the facial expressions can also be pretty funny and charming too, such as when we\u2019re first introduced to Maki after she finishes playing her song, she looks over at the door to see Honoka clapping profusely, all the while being cross-eyed; it\u2019s a shot that never fails to make me laugh just because of how stupid it looks. As a whole, Love Live is just really bland and nothing of that much interest really happens as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation, it\u2019s overall pretty solid, with each girl appearing to be pretty damn cute with rather thicc thighs. I only mention the latter part due to the fact that the show has a tendency to have low camera angles, perfectly emphasising their thighs and butts (hey, I\u2019m not a pervert for noticing this stuff, it\u2019s the SHOWS fault for storyboarding it as such!) It does utilise CGI however during the performances scenes, which, to be perfectly fair, actually looks pretty good for CGI standards, but my main criticism is that they cut constantly between the CGI models and close-ups of with the traditional animation, and as a result, it ends up coming across as jarring; breaking the flow of both the dancing and my immersion. The music, as expected of a show all about music does the job, although I wouldn\u2019t call it anything great as a whole. It\u2019s generic, catchy pop that will forget about by the time the next generic, catchy pop songs comes on. Probably the only track that I really liked was Start; dash, mainly because some twat kept singing it during the Discord chat \u2013 what a strange guy that was\u2026\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion Love Live is just an incredibly bland show, and, despite a few moments here and there, is mostly devoid of anything of any substantial merit. I admit that I did enjoy myself whilst watching the show, but much of that enjoyment was indicative of watching it with everyone else. I\u2019m sure if I watched this by myself, as I did with the last three episodes, I would be bored to tears! And this is coming from someone who typically enjoys cute girls doing cute things types of shows, but Love Live\u2019s characters are just simply not strong enough, nor are their character interactions fun enough to hold the entire show together and becomes more so a chore to watch than anything else. I think now would be a good time to clarify that I do not begrudge anyone for enjoying this show, as the tone of this review may suggest otherwise, and, if anything, I\u2019m envious. Envious of the fact that you could find so much enjoyment in something I found to be bland at best; envious that you can genuinely get excited whenever the girls begin any of their performances. As it stands, Love Live\u2019s popularity confuses me, and I understand that I am critiquing an entire franchise with this statement consisting of a second season (which I\u2019ve been told is much better than this) a movie, as well a spin-off series that also has its own sequel, but as an opening to the entire franchise, it\u2019s incredibly weak, and doesn\u2019t inspire much desire to go off and watch the rest of the series. At best Love Live is incredibly mediocre; at worst it gave me aids. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "\u201cYou can\u2019t fool television viewers with dancing girls and flashing lights\u201d - Bob Barker\r\nIf there\u2019s any pop culture entity that can dispute Mr. Barker\u2019s claim, it is the idol genre. Prizing style over substance, flair over functionality, and pizazz over practicality, titles within the idol genre have discovered success time after time by appealing to its fanbase more than anything else. Unfulfilled character arcs, glacial pacing, stale voice acting, and even gaping plot holes can all be negated by the lavish concerts and energetic score from your standard idol anime. That\u2019s not to mention the miracles that a moe pop idol can conjure; there arefew tactics with greater financial success than inserting as many cute anime chicks into your show as possible. The idol genre has proven again and again that you really can fool viewers with dancing girls and flashing lights.\\n\\n\r\nIt is in this genre that Love Live has established a name for itself. Produced by Sunrise (Cowboy Bebop, Code Geass), Love Live (or \u201cLL\u201d for short) has developed into the biggest and brightest star of the idol genre, its massive fan base and overwhelming merchandise serving as major influences for its fame. Love Live is widely considered to be the greatest anime of its particular category, if not necessarily a critical darling. However, Love Live\u2019s lofty status raises a few interesting conundrums: if titles within the idol genre are, by and large, bereft of depth and meaning, then how is one supposed to properly determine which is the greatest? Why should Love Love be considered the ideal representative of the idol genre? Do Love Live\u2019s characters display more elaborate dances than that of Aikatsu? Does LL possess a greater sense of humor than The Idolmaster? I figured that actually watching Love Live would answer my questions so that\u2019s what I did. To be perfectly honest, I harbored a few misgivings about Love Live, mainly that it's nothing more than meme fodder. However, the optimist in me believed that Love Live would be far more than that. With its charming story, LL would not only soothe my heart but inspire me to espouse its virtues as well.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Love Live didn\u2019t exactly confirm my worst fears, it is hardly a series that I\u2019d recommend. My opposition to LL doesn\u2019t stem from hatred or disappointment; rather, it is generated from the show\u2019s lackluster execution of its most basic requirements. I\u2019m more than willing to condone a mishap or two in the visual department but a grocery list of logical fallacies, one after the other, is something else entirely. For example, your show might have a problem when your story struggles to formulate a raison d'etre. Love Live is focused on three friends (Honoka, Umi, and Kotori) that desire to prevent their school from closing down but, beyond their adoration for it, they never clarify why they want to save it. If our protagonists are unaware of their cause for concern, why should I be invested in what they\u2019re doing? Anywho, the trio agree that forming a school idol group is the best course of action (because why should you start donations and petitions when you can sing for a great cause?) but first they have to be approved by Eli Ayase, the Student Council President that\u2019s overly harsh towards our aspiring heroines.\\n\\n\r\nWill our main trio find a concrete purpose for saving their school?\\n\r\nWill Ayase change her dastardly ways?\\n\r\nWill Love Live start caring about itself?\\n\\n\r\nThese questions will be answered right after Love Live exposes you to the umpteenth shot of Honoka\u2019s butt.\\n\\n\r\nAt its core, Love Live is a show that panders like no show has ever pandered before. Not only is there an obligatory beach/swimsuit episode but there\u2019s also the rampant fanservice (especially early on), as well as an unbearable \u201cchest grab\u201d gag (it has to be seen to be believed). Couple that with Love Live\u2019s excessive moe aesthetic (the sparkly eyes, the constant blushing, and the unnatural wiggling/squirming) and top it all off with the bizarre scene in episode 11 where a friend of Honoka\u2019s rubs her head and scratches her chin like Honoka is some sort of dog. What you\u2019ll get is one phenomenal crowd-pleaser of a show, a show that prefers to satisfy fetishes rather than concern itself with storytelling. The flimsily constructed plot accomplishes little beyond serving as an elaborate excuse to showcase the cuteness of Love Live\u2019s characters; the cast is nothing but a hodgepodge of stereotypes. Outside of Honoka, Umi, Kotori, and Ayase, there\u2019s the athletic one (Rin and her \u201cnya\u201ds), the intense rival (Nico and her ridiculous poses), the shy one (Hanayo and her idol obsession), the tsundere (Maki)..... and Nozomi, the Student Council Vice President that perpetrates the aforementioned \u201cchest grab\u201d gag (I\u2019ve never seen a VP constantly undermine the President quite like Nozomi does in LL).\\n\\n\r\nIt will be of little surprise to you when I say that most of Love Live\u2019s characters are inessential. Ayase and Kotori, however, are crucial to a certain extent but it\u2019s Honoka and Umi that are the true outliers. Honoka is Love Live\u2019s protagonist, a spontaneous do-gooder cut from the cloth of the spunky girl trope. What truly defines Honoka as a character are her over-the-top speeches (those bits of dialogue are downright painful in the amount of vapid positivity they exude) and her overwhelming ego (we\u2019ll get to that later). Umi, on the other hand, is Honoka\u2019s foil; she\u2019s literally the only LL character with common sense, a realistic approach, and a complex personality. As Honoka\u2019s best friend, Umi desires to aid her friend in achieving her dream but is, at first, adamantly against Honoka\u2019s idea of an idol group because Umi rightfully doubts the effort that Honoka applied to it. Over time, Umi softens her stance on Honoka\u2019s idea and of idol groups on general, even to the point where she valiantly defends the existence of idols in a climatic scene. On a surface level, Umi appears to be the stereotypical \u201cquiet one\u201d, that and nothing more, but she quickly endears herself as she wages war against her anxiety, her timidity, and the mob mentality that is an all-encompassing presence in Love Live.\\n\\n\r\nHonoka lords over Love Live with an iron fist; there isn\u2019t a single character in any medium, animated or not, that wields as much creative control as Honoka. If there\u2019s one thing that you simply must know about Love Live, it\u2019s that this show is gravitated entirely towards what Honoka desires and anyone that deviates from it is severely punished. Honoka advertises her viewpoints as essential for success and for the betterment of others but it\u2019s obvious that she's only massaging her ego. For example, Umi wants to perform in concerts with a knee-length skirt (for several logical reasons) and, while any true friend would respect Umi\u2019s wishes, Honoka, with Kotori\u2019s help, secretly created skirts of shorter length. When Umi discovers this act of treachery, she's understandably upset but Love Live more or less remains loyal to Honoka\u2019s scheme. It\u2019s all very sickening; Honoka is this lionized ringleader of debauchery and deceit with the overarching narrative and Kotori as her partners in crime (Kotori is the ideal yes-man for Honoka; she possesses very, very few individual thoughts or opinions, existing only to blindly support Honoka). The in-universe benefits that Honoka receives from LL are simply absurd; she\u2019s hailed as the idol group\u2019s leader despite not proving herself as one, she\u2019s praised for her unreasonable badgering of potential members, and her excessive pettiness is rarely admonished. The moments where Honoka is called out on her BS, like Ayase pointing out her arrogance or Nico questioning Honoka\u2019s leadership, are so, so refreshing but they are few and far between. Is it too much to expect LL to treat its characters with fairness and rationality?\\n\\n\r\nBuried deep within Love Live\u2019s framework, beneath Honoka\u2019s ego trip, beneath the gratuitous pandering, beneath the shallow characterization, is a redeemable project. It\u2019s LL\u2019s soundtrack that possesses most of this show's promise; soothing and refined, the OST is stunning in its versatility. Not only does Love Live\u2019s score contain acoustic guitar songs and piano solos but there are also big band pieces as well. Although LL tends to utilize the same five or six songs over and over, the music is still a joy to listen to. However, when you\u2019re not enchanted by Love Live\u2019s score, you're left in awe by the artificiality of it all. Like a bouquet of silk flowers, there is very little authenticity in Love Live; its worldview is far too picturesque, too quixotic, for its own good. In the world of Love Live, conflicts are resolved entirely through dogged persistence, flashbacks galore, BS logic, and the power of friendship. Any chemistry issue within the idol group is negated by the characters constantly complimenting one another. \u201cYou\u2019re the best!\u201d \u201cNo. I\u2019m not that special. YOU\u2019RE the best.\u201d NO; YOU\u2019RE THE BEST!\u201d I\u2019m almost positive that roughly 70 percent of Love Live\u2019s script is composed of exchanges like that.\\n\\n\r\nWhen Honoka\u2019s idol group wish to compete in the School Idol Tournament, the school director allows them to do so, no questions asked. She doesn't explain to them the financial costs of this decision to them nor does she schedule a meeting with their parents and teachers to determine whether or not this course of action is wise. If you thought that was an egregious example of a show bypassing logic for the sake of moving the plot forward, then, boy, do I have news for you. Love Live managed to land the jackpot in logical fallacies twice during the same episode. The first was the aforementioned example with the school director. The second? Well, allow me to explain. The director has permitted Honoka\u2019s group to participate in the School Idol Tournament only if everyone within the group lands a passing grade on an upcoming test. Because of this, everyone is diligently preparing for the big day, with Umi, Kotori, Maki, Hanayo, and Nozomi tutoring the academically challenged members of the group, specifically Honoka (she possesses the intellect of a second grader despite being in high school because of anime logic). After everyone finishes their test, the idol group members convene to share their scores with one another. They quickly discover that every member passed; however, Honoka hasn\u2019t shared her score with anyone. As the group begs her to reveal her grade, a few members express regret that their efforts will be worthless if Honoka failed. It is right then and there that Honoka dramatically unveils the graded test that was concealed behind her back. With the inspiring orchestral strings blaring in the background and a larger-than-life grin plastered on Honoka\u2019s face, her graded test is revealed\u2026. to have a score of 53.\\n\\n\r\nI would like to note that, in Japan, a 53 is a failing grade, just like it is in the rest of the world.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as acts of stupidity are concerned, this was simply breathtaking. That Love Live treated Honoka\u2019s score like some sort of grandiose achievement is not only absolutely hilarious but it\u2019s quite perplexing as well.\\n\\n\r\nWhat was the criteria for passing? To answer correctly more than half of the questions?\\n\r\nDid the teachers accept Honoka\u2019s test as a passing grade because he/she pitied Honoka?\\n\r\nWas the teacher bribed by Honoka\u2019s parents to pass her?\\n\\n\r\nNow that I\u2019m thinking about it, I know exactly why Honoka passed: because Honoka is Love Live\u2019s protagonist and presenting her with a challenging obstacle is far beyond LL\u2019s capabilities.\\n\\n\r\nDuring Love Live\u2019s final three episodes, the narrative attempted something new, gravitating towards poorly handled melodrama like a moth being drawn towards a burning candle. The result was the nadir of a thoroughly average title; Love Live\u2019s emo phase flopped because it was overbearing (especially with the histrionic soap opera that was episode 12), because it was extremely jarring (completely antithetical to a series that, up to this point, was directed towards maid cafes and pillow fights), and because it disappeared the instant that Nico ordered Honoka to stop being angsty. Amidst all of the melodrama, Love Live\u2019s finale introduced us to the highlight of the entire series, a truly beautiful scene with Honoka and Umi reminiscing on the stage of their first concert. It reminded me of what the underrated western Justified used to excel at, simply placing two characters in a given setting and allowing its masterful script to take it from there. With the aforementioned scene in Love Live, there was no overpowering song in the background, no special effects, and no unnecessary camera angles. It was just Honoka and Umi shooting the breeze. As I was watching all of this unfold, I thought to myself, \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t Love Live bother to do something like this before?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nIf Love Live really is the best that the idol genre has to offer, then I certainly won't expose myself to more of its ilk. Yes, Love Live possesses an excellent soundtrack, a lovable character in Umi, and a spark of untapped potential or two. However, that is hardly enough to deliver it from my wrath. Not only does this show have a repulsive love affair with its protagonist but it treats every other character with the utmost contempt. Not only does this show appeal to the lowest common denominator but it also insults your intelligence. Not only does this show enrage with its wasted potential but it also shoots itself in the foot with its constant tonal shifts. Vapid yet infuriating, erratic yet meandering, bewildering yet unenticing, Love Live is a jack of many trades and a master of wasting your time. Dancing girls and flashing lights cannot redeem this scrap heap of mediocrity.",

Jumps into things a little bit faster and it's funny and such a guilty pleasure. It's not bad but it's not excellent either. It's something to watch to make you smile and hum along when they sing and to laugh at the characters. It's not here to blow your mind, it's an Idol anime after all.\r\nStory - 7\r\nThe story is about this all girl's school (at least I don't remember every seeing any boys), Otonokizaka High School,and it's going to be closed down in a few years because it's not attracting any new students. So, three students decide to start an Idol club because school idols are really popular at the time. Now with determination they are working to recruit more members and become one of the best school idol groups.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not a bad story, but it's not that big of one either. It's just a simple little thing to get the anime going. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 8\\n\\n\r\nThe art is not bad in anyway. The dances are laid out very well and the characters look nice. Everything is appealing to look at and nothing makes you cringe about how poorly drawing things are. The characters are cute and all is well.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is VERY good. The singing matches the voices, by that I mean it sounds like the singing voice matches the characters voice. I'm not sure how this works (pardon my fail research skills) but it doesn't sound like different singers for the characters, which is great. The sounds are catchy and sound really nice. The OST isn't bad either.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 8.5\\n\\n\r\nI feel like the characters are lacking a bit. We know who is who and how their basic personalities are, but you don't really know much about history - SO FAR. I'm caught up with the current episode and I'll update this later, but we know very little of some of the characters. Some of them we know a little more about, however it isn't much. Each character seems to have a distinct personality though, and we already have seen a tiny bit of character development.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9\\n\\n\r\nI have been really enjoying this anime. I love girly things like this, it makes me feel so young again and I love singing and music. Enjoyment is hard to write about because it's how the viewer feels. I personally like watching all of the characters and their different ways, however some may feel differently.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7.5 ( 8 )\\n\\n\r\nI give this anime a 7.5 rating, but since you can't do that on here, it's an 8. The story is simple and kicks off the anime giving it a good start. The art isn't bad, but its not amazing either, and the characters are cute and hilarious. The sound is very nice, OST and the idol's singing and dancing. My enjoyment of this is high and the overall is decent. I say give this a shot, if you don't like it, oh well. To each his own.",

            "content": "What does it mean to sell out? For many, this term is often used in a negative light, to suggest giving up artistic integrity for the sake of appealing to the fans and getting all the profits. The sad fact is that in this day and age, more auteur products that try to tell different stories from the norm don\u2019t sell well, and that the mainstream is cluttered with copies banking on past trends for the sake of appeal. This applies to movies, TV, and even anime. Sure, there are exceptions to this, as there always are, but more often than not, I feel likethose are the products that get extremely popular, regardless of what substance lies behind them.\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings me to Love Live. If you\u2019re familiar with Japan\u2019s anime culture post 2013, you\u2019ve likely seen this franchise EVERYWHERE. It\u2019s a continuous fad really, cute girls in costumes singing pop songs. In America, you\u2019ve probably seen Love Live lines up at anime conventions all over, with tons and tons of merchandise (even incredibly creepy head masks of the girls). The franchise collectively took up THREE spots in the Top 9 of Japan\u2019s most recent Top 100 anime poll, and even the spinoff series was voted higher than Cowboy freakin Bebop! Hell, one person I know in my personal anime club doesn\u2019t even like the anime but plays the phone game to upgrade her idols like crazy!\\n\\n\r\nAs for me, I\u2019ve always been hesitant about Love Live. While sometimes I am proven wrong with stuff like Konosuba or Madoka Magica, most anime tend to be exactly what\u2019s on their cover, and the cover for Love Live looked overly bright, and relying on excess cute girl appeal with the name \u201cProject\u201d attached to the show basically saying \u201cyup, we\u2019re making this specifically to merchandise\u201d, much like K Project which I have similar feelings on. LL just didn\u2019t interest me, but I did like K-On, so when I finally went to check it out alongside many other anime reviewers, hoping it wouldn\u2019t be a sellout series, I was....not entirely let down, but still given exactly what I expected. A show trying to push current trends, having writing on the level of your average Disney sitcom, and all and all just being incredibly basic in every department. While I could enjoy different parts of Love Live, and the production behind it is generally great, the show itself never rose above follower entertainment.\\n\\n\r\nSome spoilers below:\\n\\n\r\nIt begins a young teenage girl named Honoka, finding out that GASP! Her school is going to close down! One day, when going to see her sister\u2019s school, she sees a famous idol group, and dramatically DROPS EVERYTHING to want to be an idol just like them. She then pushes her two friends, and then overtime slowly convinces new members to follow the idol path, because maybe being idols will be enough to save their school, to the chagrin of the student council President. That\u2019s the general synopsis, and if you\u2019re familiar with this type of \u201csave the school\u201d storyline, you\u2019re probably aware of exactly what to expect and go in knowing. Inevitably, idols will be preached, naysayers will be disproven, and the school will be saved, with everyone in the OP becoming an idol by the end. However, being predictable isn\u2019t immediately a crime, as even great shows can be predictable, and sometimes unpredictable shows can have haphazard plot structure or nonsensical plot twists in hindsight.\\n\\n\r\nSo what does Love Live add to it beyond exactly what you\u2019d expect to add some depth to the image? Mixed results.\\n\r\nThere are some moments to this stock premise that feel like things actually add to the story. While Honoka\u2019s motivation is as simplistic as it gets, a few of the other girls have pretty solid backdrops to want or not want to be idols in how it affects their character arcs. The name \u201cMuse\u201d they chose for their group was a clever choice in hindsight, including after a little revelation of how it was there. Another plus is the fact that the idols have to practice being idols, and some of the ideas behind this were kind of fun to see, like the whole \u201csmile while you push up\u201d thing, or the idea of holding poses for long amounts of time. They make it clear there is definitely some struggle and people who will crack at them.\\n\r\nDespite this though, almost all of it feels montaged through. While the effort is definitely there, perhaps seeing more of it actually happening rather than saying it happened would\u2019ve worked better for the overall narrative, instead of saving it all for the showcases where they seem to do it perfectly in their robotic CGI sometimes bodies. This even hurts some of the comedy. One episode revolves around the infamous NicoNico trying to prove how hard certain tasks of singing, dancing and personal appeal are to the other girls, but they just feel like they do it with no problem at all to Nico\u2019s chagrin. And we don\u2019t see any of it. It makes it feel like the show saying that Nico\u2019s persistence led to her whole group getting disbanded harder to believe.\\n\\n\r\nAside from that, most of what you get from Love Live is extremely vanilla and safe. After all, that\u2019s what people have approved in the past, why change that image if you\u2019ll make profits from it? Of course everyone sees the errors of their ways if they don\u2019t want to be idols. Of course there\u2019s a beach episode. Of course the girls dress up in cafe maid costumes, there\u2019s merch to be sold of that! Of course some of the girls have surprisingly low IQ for high schoolers, not knowing what 5 squared is and randomly forgetting basically grammatical structure in one scene only for it to never come up prior or after, we need tests!\\n\r\nAnd of course, having your boobs squeezed as punishment, which was probably a low point for me in regards to running gags that weren\u2019t funny the first time.\\n\\n\r\nIn contrast, the drama actually feels like the opposite. It\u2019s not something spread out throughout the show, but rather, mostly transplanted entirely in the final episodes for the sake of it. \\n\\n\r\nFirst off, it is only in the episode 11, the day of their festival, that it is stated where certain clubs are positioned is due to lottery. Such a thing was never stated before and feels inserted for the sake of cheap drama and about two minutes of crying. And then, immediately after, Honoka, in practicing, decides to do so alone, on a cold, dark, rainy night, gets a fever and collapses midway through the show because of it. Again, it makes it hard to care for the show\u2019s drama when it feels so forced. Then, following that, more drama pours salt into the wound, and rather than thinking about a sub member, like many actual bands, Honoka decides to QUIT IDOLS FOREVER?! Jezz lousie....Thankfully the slap that follows felt incredibly satisfying in consequence, but everything at the end felt needlessly heavy in contrast to so much to bring something apart only to bring it together at the very end. The ending is admittedly nice and sweet, if a bit predictable, but the ride there was...to put it simply milquetoast up the hill and bumpy down the uptake partly both at its best and worst when it focused on character interactions.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, in general, contribute to the vanilla feeling of the show by feeling like they were designed specifically to be merchandised, but there were some bright spots to ultimately make a passable bunch.\\n\\n\r\nStarting with the lead, Honoka, she\u2019s basically the self-proclaimed Red Ranger of the group, the one who brings the passion, cuteness, pushiness, and forced drama at the end. She could have a few likable moments as the lead character, though I feel like she needed to do more in terms of actual contribution. There\u2019s an episode dedicated to who should lead the group, and Honoka, who WAS the leader, wins out because of how much she cared. Hooray. Also, to put it simply she\u2019s....not very bright. Somehow not knowing what 5 squared is in 10th grade, and getting a 53 on her final exam WITH excessive studying. You could argue that justifies some of her decisions, but it did not make her incredible tendency to push everyone along for things that much less irritating, nor the fact that she\u2019s rewarded in the end for being selfish.\\n\r\nShe\u2019s cute and marketable though, so I guess Sunrise succeeded somewhere.\\n\\n\r\nUmi, her closest friend, is probably one of the best characters for being generally level headed and being the Only Sane Girl in a lot of cases, and her moment near the end in calling out Honoka was a highlight, but aside from a miniskirt line that reminded me of Fullmetal Alchemist, not much about her really stood out with me.\\n\\n\r\nKotori is mostly passable. She has two separate dramas, both of which are pulled out of nowhere and resolved quite cleanly. Not much of an issue the first time, very much so the second. Seeing her pursue her own passion and not be led back by Honoka\u2019s selfish one would\u2019ve been a more interesting setup for a possible season 2, but her character is generally fine.\\n\\n\r\nRin and Hanayo are basically pretty decoration (also merchandise). They get one episode of their own, which wasn\u2019t bad, but then disappear completely. Rin also has the shy girl thing Kotori already covered. Moving on.....\\n\\n\r\nTo cover both Maki and Eli at the same time, both of them were against the whole idea of idol performances at first, and had me worrying that they would be seen as Strawmen. For those who don\u2019t know, a Strawman is someone so steadfast in being wrong that they can easily be defeated by our protagonists. But in actuality, they actually had some of the best character growth of the bunch. Maki especially, the ending of Episode 10 was another highlight for the series thanks to her revelation. Eli annoyed me a lot at first in how much she seemed to be against them, and while her reason for developing felt a bit too convenient yet separate from idol-ing, her being a more big sister coach near the end was a bright spot and she was tied up well.\\n\\n\r\nNico, despite being infamous for her annoying meme catchphrase, was probably one of the better characters overall. She had a strong personality, and her point on memorable personas was pretty solid, even if it (and hiding in public) never amounted to anything of consequence. Props to Erica Mendez in the dub for giving her a lot of expression.\\n\\n\r\nEnding off with my least favorite, Nozomi. She was by far the hardest to like. Not for being a stealth mentor, that\u2019s something I can buy, but for basically being a gag machine. One gag. Specifically. That being, squeezing boobs of the girls as punishment. It became her only character thing for a while and the One Squeeze gag was not funny the first time yet was consistently repeated to my annoyance. Gotta have that fanservice right?\\n\\n\r\nEveryone else was basically there to preach idolism, whenever it called for it. It was a solid effort to try and develop so many main characters, but I don\u2019t think it paid off, as with some exceptions most show as pretty faces on toys more than anything else.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, speaking of pretty, gosh darn it this show can look great in the best of times. Mecha oriented Studio Sunrise took the reins for an idol series, and when it wants to, the show really shines. Lots of bright colors, polished character designs, a large variety of different outfits, some gorgeous view shots and even the CGI used for the dancing is relatively high quality. Only real catch with the visuals, basic character designs being a minor thing, is the constant switch between 2D to 3D during the idol performances. I didn\u2019t like when Luck & Logic did the switches for no reason and I\u2019m not a fan of it here either. It\u2019s jarring, and plays a weird eye trick on me when they change back and forth. Still though, great animation and pretty colors, adds to the image.\\n\\n\r\nWhat\u2019s more disappointing is the soundtrack. I get that I\u2019m not really an idol fan, but aside from the OP, no particular showcase track really stood out at all. Maybe I\u2019d have to relisten to them, but even Kyoukai no Kanata\u2019s 1 idol song was more memorable than any of these. They weren\u2019t bad, they did their job, just didn\u2019t leave a strong impression which is disappointing for a music anime. The ED is perfectly fine and listenable, same for the background music. As for the dub, we have some solid performances from Erica Lindbeck as Eli, who brings an air of maturity to the role, Caitlin Glass as Maki, and even though I could be annoyed with Honoka\u2019s character at times, relative newbie Marieve Herington captures just enough energy to make her cute in the best of times. Again, special mention to Erica Mendez for capturing the personality in Nico\u2019s character. Everyone else did fine, nothing exceptional but nothing outright bad.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\\n\r\nSo, after all of this, would I consider Love Live a sellout? In some ways yes. The plot is incredibly shallow and sometimes forced, it relies a lot on pushing current trends to be a follower and the characters aren\u2019t too much to show for, but I can\u2019t deny that, once in a while, the show had an honest to god sweet moment, a moment where I excepted depth comes into play, or a charming scene. Despite how simplistic everything was, my enjoyment was decently high for a while. Then when the end drama sprouted its way into the final three episodes, I became annoyed more than anything else. Annoyed with what I saw unfold, creating substantial pathos before quickly having it brushed aside. It became a lot harder to emphasize with Honoka, and it didn\u2019t end well for me despite the ending being sweet. Love Live has earnest effort, at times I can see that, but with exception to some moments and characters, feels misguided, perfectly in the norm, and hard to distinguish otherwise. It\u2019s a show that failed to have me engaged and sadly fell too close to the disinterest that kept me away from it for so long.\\n",

            "content": "Bad, boring and bland. While the times where these terms are applicable are many, they rarely are as universally applicable and descriptive as they are with Love Live. Everything, barring a single ray of hope in the entire show, can be described as such. Everything, ranging from plot, to characters, to the J-Pop music, everything in this show, all of it is bad, boring and bland.\r\nFair warning: This review contains spoilers!\r\nOn paper, the concept sounds simple: a series about cute school idols singing and dancing their way to stardom. While the concept itself admittedly didn\u2019t excite me all that much in the first place, theflimsy plot and its boring structure still managed to disappoint. The initial conflict, the school of the protagonists closing down and merging with another school, is uninteresting. At a point where the cast isn\u2019t even properly introduced yet, there isn\u2019t any actual investment present. Consequently, I couldn\u2019t have cared less about the school \u201cclosing down\u201d, and honestly I still wonder why the characters did, anyway. Now, building on this\u2026 questionable initial problem, Honoka decides that forming a school idol group will make the school more popular. This is supposed to save the school from closing down. A very simple problem-solution relationship, in the mind of Honoka, at least. \\n\\n\r\nAn empty auditorium. No audience at all. This is the picture painted by the first performance of their newly-founded idol group, Muse. This empty auditorium as such symbolizes the start line, the start for a story of this group ascending from rags, unpopular amateurs, to riches, universally beloved and popular school idols. This display of passion by Muse is recorded by an anonymous spectator, later revealed to be Eri (who actually is shown peeking into the auditorium and then leaving, but I digress). Slowly but steadily, the group grows into a group of nine girls of fluctuating distinctiveness. \\n\\n\r\nSeemingly out of nowhere and with little fanfare, the eponymous competition Love Live is introduced. Measured by an arbitrary level of popularity which is never properly explained, the 20 top school idol groups compete for the title of \u201cthe best idol group\u201d. The plot gradually loses track, loses focus and during loosely related events only introduced to serve as a platform for short concerts, Muse grows increasingly popular. Little to no feeling of progression is actually present through the whole ordeal. Instead of showing other idol groups, how they are different in style and skill level, the show presents meaningless numbers that mean little and tell nothing. Due to the pacing and the poor handling of the supposed new main attraction Love Live, it  becomes obvious that there isn\u2019t enough time left to actually have the competition take place. The show has to make do with another kind of finale, while still leaving the potential goal of winning Love Live open for another installment.\\n\\n\r\nThe introduction of another conflict was foreseeable. But, somehow, the show still manages to introduce something way out of left field. Kotori gets an invitation to follow her dream of fashion designing. Honoka is so eager to practice on the last night before her final concert that she decides to do it outside, in the middle of the night under pouring rain. She catches a cold and collapses right after their first song. Muse (like expected) withdraws from Love Live and Honoka throws a fit, the situation escalates until Honoka gets slapped in the face. This supposed \u201cclimax\u201d left nothing but confusion and frustration. The whole conflict did, really. Kotori\u2019s interest in fashion design and her possibly leaving the country in the future gets introduced too late to feel like a genuine \u201cthreat\u201d, like something that could actually happen. It is obvious from the get-go that she won\u2019t leave the country and will stay with the group, because it\u2019s obvious this \"threat\" is only introduced for it the be resolved as the series\u2019 finale. It is obvious that this show will follow the most formulaic storytelling possible. The whole conflict feels like it doesn\u2019t belong in the show at all. It all ends in a very cliche scene in which Honoka stops Kotori at the last possible minute and they make up. They make up because Honoka is selfish and puts her desire to have a group of nine with Kotori in it (rather than just continuing as a group of eight or recruit a new member) over Kotori\u2019s dream. Because Kotori didn\u2019t actually want to leave, apparently. Love Live manages to be both predictable in its overall structure and unpredictable in its sheer stupidity. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot does follow established formulas all the way through. However this doesn\u2019t only apply to the overall structure, but to about anything else as well. It comes off as no surprise that the character cast of Love Live consists of flat and tropey characters. In an attempt to include as many different girls which appeal to as many different (otaku) people possible, the show neglects nearly all of them completely. The most prominent example is Rin. Initially interested in track, she urges her friend Hanayo to join Muse, then decides to join too while she\u2019s at it. For the rest of the show her being athletic will never be brought up again and her only character traits are that she likes Hanayo and the usage of \u201cnyan\u201d while making a cat mouth. Hanayo herself is at first a shy and quiet girl that loves school idols, then devolves into a character whose only trait is liking idols right after joining the group. However the saving grace of this show, Nico, is also mainly defined by loving school idols however, compared to Hanayo she excels at it.  Therein lies the next big problem of the show: There is a lot of overlap between the character casts\u2019 traits, to the point were they are hardly distinguishable at times. Apart from Nico and Honoka, the cast feels too same-y, like interchangeable trope characters. The few attempts at constructing interesting (albeit also cliched) character relations such as the relationship between Eri and Nozomi, get wholly destroyed through the show\u2019s numerous reiterations of that very relationship. While it is clear for any onlooker that Nozomi is very close to Eri, for some reason the show needs the characters to outright state that this relationship exists through the characters pointing it out several times. \u201cShow, don\u2019t tell\u201d is one of the most popular writing advices and for good reason. These moments are oleaginous and make the character relationships feel artificial.\\n\\n\r\nLove Live isn\u2019t all bad however, and while the visuals don't stand out as much as a whole, the backgrounds are consistently pretty and pleasing to look at with a lot of detail. The character designs however have the same problems as the characters themselves: They all are colorcoded to fit their respective archetypes and their body figures cover the most ground possible to appeal to the largest number of (otaku) people possible. If not for the aforementioned colorcoding I would have trouble remembering the characters; all of them, again apart from Nico and Eri, are bland to a fault. Character movement is for the most part well-animated, although admittedly only Nico stands out from the crowd with the by far most energetic movement and most expressive faces (again).\\n\\n\r\nThe performances themselves were okay. While the constant changing between 2D and 3D animation is pretty jarring (mostly because the CG isn\u2019t all that pretty), all of the performances were energetically animated. Overall they were more fun to look at than to listen to though. The songs themselves never go farther than average to mediocre J-Pop with the only song remotely resembling a standout track being \u201cSTART:DASH!!\u201d. It\u2019s also a shame that the supposed standouts, Maki as a singer and Eri as a dancer, never actually have standout moments during the show.\\n\\n\r\nLove Live is a show that is mediocre all the way through: Boring archetype characters, poor plot with forced melodrama that doesn\u2019t fit the overall tone of the show and bland J-Pop songs merge and create an overall bad experience. The few moments of genuine fun, mostly in the form of Nico\u2019s fun shenanigans, shine through here and there but they aren\u2019t enough to save this show from feeling like a oleaginous corporate product.\\n",

            "content": "This show is a sad guilty pleasure of mine. I shouldn't like this, but I did. \r\nIt shows what hard work can really achieve. Especially with so much competition out there. It can really motivates you to be successful. With all that aside  the show is very shallow and simple.\r\nCute girls dancing and singing to save their beloved school.\r\nStory: Based around nine girls working to become idols and save their school. The initial story is okay, but nothing ever goes past that. The plot is weak and suffers from this, but what can you expect from a 13 episode series. The story can onlybe comparable when you take a slice-of-life. Each episode itself has it's own story. Don't expect much from it. I simply watched it for fun, nothing more or less. \\n\\n\r\nPut aside potential flaws it gave a calming and easygoing atmosphere. This made the show feel comfortable. Like laying in your bed at night, nothing really changes, but it doesn't ever feel uncertain. \\n\r\nSorry fans of this show but I'm going to give the story a 6.\\n\\n\r\nArt: It wasn't bad at all. I didn't even know sunrise could make this high of quality. All aspects of the girls stage, and clothing were unique and changed often. This kept me waiting to see the next outfit. \\n\r\nWatching in HD i could tell some of the drawings during performances almost looked 3d. This wasn't necessarily a bad thing. At times it got weird to watch and i almost wished it would just stay 2d. It was more likely done because of budget.  Much better than other shows *cough cough* .\\n\r\nArt is an 8.  \\n\\n\r\nSound: I can't say much since i watched it in subbed and not many emotions were expressed through the characters. Other than that as far I could tell they fit the characters, nothing oddball my ears could hear. \\n\r\nWho could forget about the music. Most of the songs picked were very catchy and often found myself bobbing my head.\\n\r\nThis deserves an 8. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: This is where the show failed to deliver on. For the first couple of episodes I didn't even know Kitori's mom was the principle. By this time almost the whole group had been already established. \\n\r\nwhen looking back at it most of the group was very 2 dimensional. Backgrounds never spoken, wondering even if some of the girls said a word after wanting to join Muse. \\n\r\nAlthough the ones that were shown some light had different personalities. All these differences make them very lovable. You could basically read all these characters, like the back of your hand. \\n\r\nThis was very traumatizing to characters, and made it almost boring. \\n\r\nWhat could be more wrong? The fact that not once did they develop really in much of a way. \\n\r\n-The over dramatic sad scene at the end didn't prove anything.\\n\r\nCharacter, gets a 5.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Like i said i really enjoyed this. Probably much more than I should have. Just the cuteness of everything kept me going. What does that say about me? I am a sucker for cute girls dancing in cute costumes. Hell Yeah! \\n\r\nA 7 for enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Don't set goals high, at best don't set any. With that type of thinking you might like it. \\n\r\nTheir are many shows of this variety, that said the originality is near zero. I don't recommend this if you look for deep plot inducing anime. I am forewarning you that their is not one guy in this. The rest is your choice at this point, is it worth watching or not? I would respond with yes. My hormones kept me going. I conclude my official first review with a 7.",

Hakone,the main protagonist, loves idols, and sees idols are attracting students to other schools. So she, along with her cute friends, the energetic Kotori and shy Umi, after a bit of convincing on Umi's side, make an idol group. They find out from the school council that there is all ready an idol club, and so convince the only remaining member of the club, Yazawa, to let them join. It's safe to say all goes well, but that's the general gist, I'll leave the non-viewers to experience.\\n\r\nART - I love the art. It's clean and sharp, and very bright and colourful. Some people don't like CGI, but you can't argue with the picture it creates. It's all very beautiful.\\n\r\nSOUND - The sound is outstanding. I mean, it's a musical anime anyway, with it being about idol's and everything, but just listen to the intro theme. That is literally on my phone for the sole reason of being my alarm! And the ending theme! And all the songs in between!\\n\r\nCHARACTER - The characters in this are very personal to me. They are introduced at a reasonable pace, with the 3 main characters being the only 3 of the club for about half the anime, so you get used to them, and the others being recruited for various reasons (previous acting, infuated by idols looks etc). But the 3 main characters remind me, a male, of me and my 3 childhood friends. Sure, that makes 4, but it's still very, very personal, and anyone who is in the same boat as me will understand!\\n\r\nOVERALL/ENJOYMENT - As I stated at the beggining, this is totally my favourite anime, and it comes down to two things: The personal characters and the awesome music. I won't go on any long, but will end with my score, I can't give it anything more than a 10/10.",

The plot, The character everything was perfect, the song, the soundtrack, the characterof each of the idol. This anime change my whole perspective towards idol based anime.

The characters are really cute girls that fit almost every aspect of anime girls.The main character, Honoka, is a hyper happy-go-lucky girl who seems like a really hard worker and thats why you love her. What got me to like this anime was the music, its cute and catchy, and i love music like that. If you watch don't expectany real drama and especially don't expect any romance cause there wasn't any boys.\\n\r\nThis is a good anime to watch when your bored and have a full day to yourself.",

            "content": "When this show was airing I decided not to watch Love Live, because its  ain't my style however I ended up watching it because of the rhythm game app I found in a commercial.\r\nThis show is really enjoyable. The art, and music were really great and I found myself somehow excited to watch the next episode (hasn't happened in a while.) Now I know I said its enjoyable, but only if you don't really think about it. (I watched while I waited for my LP to refill) \r\nThe plot is a group of girls become idols to save their school. Original really, however Ifound it extremely unrealistic because everything seemed to go the main girls way, and they all knew how to sing. Its odd seeing nine people extremely talented at singing to the point they don't need to practice. It also was really predictable, I could for see every character who joined, (you can say its because of the opening, but no. Its just predictable.) And it was all shounen anime where every enemy suddenly become friends with the main. Character. Do people even like their school that much? Why does she love that school so much? Is it because her mom went their? Why?!\\n\\n\r\nArt was good since it went between 2D animation and MMD's I think their called. (Though I've seen better quality ones on YouTube.) The songs manage to make me smile and all were fully translated which was nice since I'm big on lyrics.\\n\\n\r\nDespite this being a more anime it wasn't really moe which is odd. K-on which is a similar show I manage to love at least 2 of their characters (Mio and Azunyan) but with I didn't really like any besides Niko and that's just because I managed to relate to her ( my friends blow me off a lot.) Also the main girl everything went her way, it was seriously annoying. \\n\\n\r\n[Spoiler] \\n\r\nAt the end one of the girls was about to leave and the main chick goes into the airport right as she was about to board the plane (how did she get in?) And talked her into staying. (What happened to the plane ticket? You can't just stop stuf like that. Also she is seriously selfish. I've been told I'm selfish, but I'm selfish in a sense that I do my own thing. I don't mess anyone else's life up. She does something she drags everyone down with her.\\n\r\n[Spoiler]\\n\\n\r\nOverall I think this show needs more moe. The only reason I can see someone watching this is so they can play the rhythm game. (It isn't needed but it makes it easier to choose favorites.) The show wasn't funny, moe, or even inspirational. I don't think being a idol would be tough if you can control the weather, and have amazing talent like that, and get everything else you want. Like she screamed at the rain to stop and it did! I'm not even joking. Screw being a idol, be a weather girl. If I had the chance to go back in time and stop myself from watching this I probably would. Yeah watching it is enjoyable but once you get down and think about it you go into this living hell!",

            "content": "Disclaimers: Spoilers, this review covers the Love Live! School Idol Project anime series, which means season 1, 2, and the movie, and this review will be a bit more personal than your typical review. This review is also long as fuck, and there will be a spoiler free TL;DR at the end. \r\nLove Live sucks major balls.\r\nUpon viewing my profile, one would probably witness a few Love Live memes here and there, a shit ton of Love Live characters in my favorites list, and possibly a Love Live profile picture, although I constantly change it so it depends. Seems like a typical Love Live fagto most people. However, believe it or not, I think Love Live is pretty god damn bad. Or at least, I thought. If anything, the only things that I actively like about it are the characters, usually because they are extremely entertaining, endearing, and lovable (with the exception of one character, which I will get to later.) The story of Love Live is mediocre at best, and one could argue that the story is completely garbage. With cliche and cringey moments, overly sappy melodrama, and with uneven character development to boot, one shouldn\u2019t watch Love Live for a quality story. I can\u2019t really say anything about the music of Love Live, since music is like the most subjective thing in the world, but I don\u2019t like most idol music. There are only a few songs that I can listen to multiple times, but most of the time, I can barely sit through the songs even once. The art and animation are subpar as well, especially when the camera zooms out and the characters become barely recognizable sketches. So why do I still like Love Live so much, despite all the shit that it has?\\n\\n\r\nAfter a VERY lackluster first season, I sat down and reflected on the past 4 hours that I wasted on this show and thought to myself: holy shit, I had a good time. Why is it that such a flawed story is able to leave me in such a satisfied state? No way is it because \u201cit\u2019s so bad that it\u2019s good,\u201d nor is it because \u201cyou\u2019re a dirty memer Yuni, and Love Live is full of dirty memes.\u201d I came to the conclusion that it\u2019s because of how memorable Love Live as a franchise is. Despite my cringey experience watching the first season, I found myself thinking about Love Live constantly afterwards, and not about how bad the drama was handled or how gimmicky and cliche the characters were, but of how catchy that one song I actually liked was or how\u2026 gimmicky and cliche the characters were, but in a good way! I would then get flashbacks to a random scene, such as Kotori acting like a foreigner, Nozomi fondling little boobs, or Honk Honk doing the seal clap in episode one. Little scenes like that, although usually just comedic skits or filler, gave me such great satisfaction that I felt like it was worth sitting through Honoka dying on stage for no reason. Even so, I still wasn\u2019t ready to say that I liked Love Live at the time. I simply liked a few of the scenes, a few of the characters, and a few of the songs. Everything else was still meh.\\n\\n\r\nThen Season 2 reared it\u2019s ugly head and that\u2019s when my heart felt all the doki dokis. When it comes to \u201csequels that drastically improve the franchise\u2019s quality,\u201d people always think of Clannad After Story, or maybe Little Busters Refrain. I\u2019d like to add Love Live 2nd Season to that list, for I never knew a sequel could change my opinion of a franchise so quickly. Not only was the drama much more tolerable, but it made me fall in love with the cast so hard, that even the ones I borderline hated during season 1 were perfect angels in my eyes. In fact, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever loved a cast this much since Aria. And I fucking adore Aria. Then there was the movie, which not only depicted Manhattan pretty goddamn well (I\u2019m a New Yorker), but it also sent off \u03bc's the same way they were introduced to us: with a long drawn out bang. \\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nLove Live seems like your typical \u201cAH! Dire situations and sparks of inspiration cause me to drag my friends into something out of the ordinary, something that causes us to start out as underdogs as well slowly rise to the top through the power of friendship!\u201d kind of story, and that\u2019s basically what it is at the surface level. However, by the end of the story, the viewer doesn\u2019t give a fuck about whether or not \u03bc's is gonna succeed in their next concert, instead, they are desperately holding on to their doki doki-ing hearts in anticipation and preparing themselves for the inevitable: Honk Honk, here comes the feels train! This is what causes Love Live to be labeled as a completely clone of K-On, a show where a group of girls are in a similar situation: they want to do something out of the ordinary and strive to improve, however the story really isn\u2019t about that life. It\u2019s all about the passage of time, and Love Live makes it extremely apparent in its narrative that time is not only limited, but running out FAST! This is what separates Love Live from the other passage of time anime, as while K-On and Aria are taking their time sipping tea and rowing gondolas, Love Live is dancing along at a breakneck speed. The thing about passage of time anime is that it\u2019s really only effective if you love the characters. Both K-On and Aria start out with their characters in a very friendly environment, with all of the characters being lovable from the start and the only conflict resulting from the natural clashes between their personalities, such as Azu-nyan being put off by Yui\u2019s laziness, or Alice being mad at Akari\u2019s lack of IQ. Also keep in mind that passage of time anime usually have a manageable cast of main characters, with K On having 5 and Aria having 3 (4 if you count Alicia, and 6 if you count the other fairies). \\n\\n\r\nHowever, Love Live has a massive 9 main characters, some of which were outright hostile cockblockers during their introduction. You would think it would be impossible for a story to take 9 characters, some of which are shown to be bitches, and somehow make them lovable by the end. That\u2019s what I thought too at the end of season 1, where I was only fond of a select few characters. This is a big reason why season 1 was a fairly lackluster season, it failed to properly show that appeal of some of the characters. This isn\u2019t solely due to the fact that some characters were prioritized over others, it also has to do with how poorly the drama was handled. The words that come to mind are: overly exaggerated, sappy, bullshit. The realism in Love Live is non existent, but that is to be expected. Anyone who expects realism in a show like Love Live needs to get a reality check. That doesn\u2019t change how unnecessarily over the top some of the drama during the first season was, as well as how unbelievable some of the drama was resolved. Even if realism is limited, it still has to be believable, or at least, not bullshit.\\n\\n\r\nWhat the 1st season does correctly is a few instances of character drama surrounding a few particular characters, those being Honk, Kotori, Nico, and Eli. For Honk, her extremely typical main character attitude actually works against her in scenarios that other anime would write as beneficial. For example, her focus on competing in Love Live actually ends up damaging her relationship with her friends instead of strengthening them, and while some events surrounding this drama and the resolution are iffy, it still gets the job done. Kotori also breaks the mold when she goes against what her character trope would normally do: hurt her best friend. Usually depicted as the typical friendly deredere, Kotori was revealed to actually be a very conflicted character whose problems end up hurting those she loves, which is contradictory to her normal character. Both Nico and Eli are also fleshed out as characters who chased their dreams and failed, which shapes them into the hostile characters that they were introduced as, and while Nico's hostility was shown to just be natural, Eli's hostility was much deeper, albeit the resolution was stupid. Love Live's major problem in season 1 is that the drama is there, and for the most part it isn't exactly bad drama, but it has absolutely no idea how to either execute or resolve it in a believable way.\\n\\n\r\nHmm, it would appear that Honoka is very ill and not exactly in a good state to sing and dance. What do? The overly protective Kotori and the wiser Umi would stop Honoka from over exerting herself, causing the performance to be cancelled, the fans to be disappointed, and Honoka would learn her lesson and taste what disappointing her fans would be like. That would be some nice development for her character! But wait, that\u2019s not what actually happens. \\n\r\nWhat actually happens is that Honoka insists on performing, so she does. Honk has run out of PP for her dance moves! Honk used Struggle! Honk hurt herself in recoil. Honk fainted. And that leads to Honk being a depressed crybaby, \u03bc's dropping out of Love Live, Honk nearly quitting the school idol thing, only to get bitch slapped by Umi, which leads to Honk not being a crybaby, which leads to literally no one learning anything and Honk continues to do stupid shit cause why not.\\n\\n\r\nSo Season 1 ends with \u03bc's saving the school, and \u03bc's miss their chance to compete in Love Live. Oh well, beggers can\u2019t be choosers right? At least they completed their initial goal! As a result of her efforts, Season 2 starts with Honk being chosen to be the student council president. While this seemed like an unnecessary thing to do, this was the beginning of Love Live\u2019s redemption! It\u2019s all (mostly) positivity from here on out! Remember when I said that Love Live is a passage of time show? The moment Honk becomes student council president marks the beginning of this theme. While subtle, it did expand on the running out of time problem, as being the student council prez resulted in a lot of schedule conflicts between idol practice and council work. But wait, idol practice? What are they practicing for? A 2nd Love Live has been announced! With saving the school out of the way, \u03bc's can finally focus on their real goal.\\n\\n\r\nIt is here, pretty early on in season 2, that it is made clear that time is running out. This pressure of time, first mentioned when it is made clear that the 3rd years are graduating soon, is constantly brought up, both within the show itself and within the viewer\u2019s minds. At first it\u2019s through subtle things, such as the previously mentioned schedule conflicts of being the student council prez, resulting in usually humorous but still important bickerings between Honk and Umi. A sense of responsibility is placed on Honok\u2019s shoulders, as a leader of the school and of \u03bc's. \\n\\n\r\nSeason 2 also makes it clear that time is passing by through the use of specific events, such as Halloween, Christmas, New Years, etc. Many episodes in Season 2 are based around these timed events, and result in a not-so subtle flow of time. By the way, the Halloween episode is one of my favorites, as it has some of my favorite skits in the entire series. Season 2 also uses this time to flesh out characters that didn\u2019t have much spotlight in season 1, and while these moments of character development were touching, it was all the characters and their interactions with each other that made me adore every single member. Time didn\u2019t just flow, it helped the girls grow to love each other. Episode after episode, you could tell that their friendship was subtly growing, and it\u2019s all about the little things. Maki agreeing with Honk sometimes, Eli and Nozomi showing their more innocent and sensitive sides to their kouhais, even the most humorous of skits showed that the teamwork and bond between the girls of \u03bc's were ever growing.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the urgency of time running out is at first caused by \u03bc's trying to do something before a deadline, eventually it became much deeper than that. While the story kept its style of \u03bc's trying to get something done before a specific time, it became clear that both the characters and the viewers were actually bracing for the real deadline: the time when the 3rd years would graduate, and \u03bc's would be split apart. This is what the entire series was building up towards. As the cliche line goes, all good things must come to an end. Even the mightiest of rivers empty out into the calm endless sea. Even a floating leaf in the wind will land someday. Whatever sappy phrase you want to use, this theme is so especially present in Love Live that it\u2019s undeniably powerful. In fact, \u03bc's spent so much of their time bracing themselves for this inevitable end that they didn\u2019t even realize that they were missing an important answer: what do they want their end to be?\\n\\n\r\nThis is the entire theme of the finale, the movie. The movie is the perfect mix of cute grills doing cute things, cute grills dancing in cute ways, and borderline psychological drama. It even has hints of supernatural elements, which were used in very effective albeit confusing ways. After becoming much more famous than she could ever imagine, with expectations placed on every part of her being, Honk\u2019s internal conflicts were at an all time high. To a normal viewer, the right answer isn\u2019t clear at all. In fact, many people could have different answers when placed in Honk\u2019s situation. There really is no right or wrong answer, and the decision that \u03bc's came to at the end wasn\u2019t right or wrong either. It was simply what they wanted. And that\u2019s how the passage of time works. A very straight forward story, with a not so straightforward and possibly even thought provoking end. Even so, despite the melancholic passing of time and the internal conflicts, the ending was ultimately a positive one, and I can\u2019t help but feel the ultimate satisfaction.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nEasily my favorite part of the franchise, as well as probably the make or break for anyone watching Love Live. To some, they are simply gimmicks and memes who are mildly entertaining once in awhile, and to others, they are precious waifus that we must protect from any sort of harm. What do I think? I think they are precious gimmicky memes that are mildly entertaining once in awhile, and must be protected from any sort of harm. So of course I will be going through all of them.\\n\\n\r\nHanayo: Despite the fact that she's at the bottom of my list, Hanayo is probably the most well written character in LL in terms of characterization. The point of school idols is that any normal girl can be one, and that's the whole theme surrounding Hanayo. She doesn't stand out at all, in terms of personality nor appearance. As a result, she views school idols as an unreachable goal and worships them from afar. The fact that Hanayo joined Muse in the first place is a groundbreaking development for the group and idol shows as a whole, for it highlighted the whole point of school idols. Also, her rice obsession is one of the most relatable parts of the show. As a Chinese person, rice is my entire being.\\n\\n\r\nRin: My appreciation for this character is always exponentially increasing. Rin is insecurities personified into a tomboy cat character. Unlike Hanayo, Rin has had experiences of standing out too much, having being teased for her femininity despite her short hair and boyish attitude. This caused Rin to embrace this boyish attitude and energy in order to separate herself from her insecurities. Rin was very hesitant in joining Muse since being school idols is hella girly and she feel like her lack of femininity will cause her to bring the group down. However, her joining the group ends up helping her come to terms with her insecurities, and her episode was one of the most heartfelt episodes in the series.\\n\\n\r\nMaki: Maki's tsundere personality comes off less as a mental illness and more of a result of her upbringing. Due to being a sheltered rich girl, Maki isn't a tsundere cause she's mean, but because she's socially retarded lol. However, joining Muse helped her shed her awkward self contained self, and Maki is one of the few tsunderes who returns the favor to those who helped her break out of her shell. After being coaxed out by her senpais, Maki thanks them by helping Nozomi come out of her shell as well, and she made Nico out of all people cry. Her personality is also very similar to mine, as a withdrawn socially awkward yet passive aggressive sasser who isn't afraid to look down on you if you piss her off. I also share some frustrations she has when it comes to songwriting, for I am a songwriter myself, and I also say \"what the fuck was that\" a lot. \\n\\n\r\nHonk: Honk is one of the more well written genki lead characters, due to the fact that her genkiness isn't one dimensional nor predictable. Her genkiness isn't always positive, as some of the time it's actually her own selfishness, and her overly determined nature actually ends up damaging her relationship with her friends. Honk isn't the perfect happy go lucky person she appears to be, as she is almost constantly internally conflicted and ends up coming off as an asshole more often than not due to her selfishness. Of course, Honk isn't the most consistent character, as her IQ switches between 1 and 100 constantly, but she's definitely deeper than what people give her credit. What makes her relatable in this regard is that she means well, and most of the time doesn't even know she's selfish. This also creates GREAT conflict drama between her, Kotori, and Umi, as Honk's characterization isn't just due to her own characteristics, but also her two closest friends.\\n\\n\r\nKotori: Kotori comes off as your typical airhead deredere, except she does what no other deredere is capable of doing: absolutely destroying her best friend's feelings. Her tendency to spoil Honoka is seen as cliche by many, for many think it's cause she's too nice of a character, but it's actually her own selfishness that is causing her to be so nice. Her refusal to hurt her friend's feelings isn't just cause she wants the best for her, but because she is too conflicted and unwilling to break bad news. Due to her selfish refusal of doing the right thing, her niceness actually ends up hurting Honoka even more than she could ever have imagined. Kotori is seen depressed more than people think, and her habit of putting on a deredere demeanor isn't because she cares, but because of her own flaws and conflicts.\\n\\n\r\nUmi: Umi on the other hand is the opposite of Kotori. She calls Honk out on her bullshit constantly, and her tough love is a turn off to many. People view her as a sociopath due to her constant bullying of Honoka, but due to being brought up by Asian parents, I see the true intent behind Umi's savage nature. Umi's anger and unstable emotions show me that Umi probably loves her friends more than anyone else. She isn't afraid to completely fuck someone up if it's for their own good. Of course, since Umi is a hardcore dandere, she can have her fair share of selfish moments, but in the end, no one gives more shits than Umi does, even if it looks like she's gives no shits about your feelings.\\n\\n\r\nEli: A phenomenally multi dimensional character, a lot of flaws surrounding Eli are actually the story's fault. Eli is the ultimate cockblock in the beginning, and boy did I hate her. This made her redemption as a character all the more heartfelt, as I ended up loving Eli by the end. While the story portrayed her as a stern white knight, who's reasons for despising Muse is due to her lack of confidence in them when it comes to saving the school, it eventually became clear that Eli's distaste actually stems from her stubbornness and pride. As an ex-professional dancer, she views Muse's activities as mere games and looks down upon them constantly. The flaw behind her eventual opening up is that the members of Muse were way too lenient with her. This bitch thinks y'all are trash and you're gonna forgive her just like that? Yeah. Again, this isn't due to Eli's character, this is due to Season One's atrocious writing.\\n\\n\r\nNozomi: Nozomi takes the spotlight as one of the easiest characters to like, both from a characteristic and development stand point. She's the smug mastermind. Her Washi washi may turn off a lot of people, but hey, the author is a Yuri author. Cut her some slack. What made Nozomi even more likeable was when her past was revealed. Nozomi used to be extremely shy, contrary to her extremely calculative nature we see now. Her friendship with Eli and their close bond is what caused Nozomi to transform into what she is now, and that's just a testament to the canon ship that is NozoEli. Seeing Nozomi open up to the rest of Muse and allowing her true shy nature to slip in once in a while humanizes her exponentially.\\n\\n\r\nNico: Nico is the most controversial character. Very rarely do you see someone who thinks Nico is \"alright.\" Nico will usually find herself on the very bottom or the very top of people's rankings. I'm one of the latter, Nico is one of my best girls, but my reasons for liking this monstrosity is different from most people. My reason doesn't just boil down to \"she's funny\" or \"she's a meme.\" First of all, let's be honest: Nico is a fucking piece of shit human being. She's the type of person you'd block on all social media outlets. A real life Nico would have no friends, and I learned that the hard way. You see, Nico is a character that chased her dreams with everything she had, and failed. She didn't fail because \"the world is unfair.\" No, Nico deserved to fail. Nico failed because she failed to see how selfish she was, pushing people beyond their limits without them wanting to. She failed because being a school idol is a team effort and she only thought of herself. The reason she failed is nobody's fault but her own. As someone who's been chasing their dreams for ages, experiencing failure after failure and blaming it on the world, only to slowly realize that I'm the one who's failing myself, seeing this part of Nico made me cry. Not gonna lie, this side of Nico destroyed me. It didn't help that when I was younger, I was also very foul mouthed and hot tempered. I'm one of those real life Nicos. Nico's shitty personality persisted throughout the series, such as lying to her siblings to make her look good and disrespecting the rest of Muse. That's because leaving behind your selfish self is hard. Extremely hard. Nico's flaws lasted all the way till the end of the series, and hell, she was still an annoying shitter at the end, but that's cause this is realism. People don't change at the drop of the hat, and some people don't change at all, but Nico still accepted it and tried to change till the very end. Nico's determination is honestly inspiring, and that drew me to her character as well.\\n\\n\r\nNico is one badass motherfucker.\\n\\n\r\nA cast full of characters that naturally clash with each other, yet even so, they grow with each other to the point where every single character is irreplaceable. The characters bicker with each other constantly, yet their contrasting personalities somehow work with each other. In fact, the characters themselves realize that their drastically different personalities are what make them stand out from other idol groups, and it is because of how irreplaceable every single member of \u03bc's is that causes them to disband their group at the end of the series.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation:\\n\\n\r\nCG is distracting, and while Love Live\u2019s CG is much better than your typical anime, it\u2019s still, well, distracting. This is especially so during some concert scenes when it rapidly switches between 2d and 3d animation. However, I\u2019ve witnessed some horrible CG in my life, so I grew to appreciate Love Live\u2019s relatively tolerable CG. The 2d animation and art during the actual show isn\u2019t very impressive either. While the character designs by themselves are goofy in their own way and eventually grew on me, the animation and art quality is very inconsistent, ranging from pretty good to downright despicable at times. This is especially apparent during scenes where the camera zooms out, and the characters become barely recognizable sketches, with weirdly scaled facial features and bodies. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing that Love Live excels at however are the facial expressions. These goddamn facial expressions are golden, and are used to support both comedic and serious situations. There is a lot of emotion behind these facial expressions, and you can tell what a character is thinking just by looking at their face. You can tell when Eli is done with someone\u2019s bullshit just by looking at her unamused stare. Even the characters are able to react to situations based on another character\u2019s facial expression, such as Kotori constantly wrecking Umi in cards due to Umi\u2019s lack of a poker face, or Nico knowing that her boobies are in for a rough time due to Nozomi\u2019s rape face. The majority of Honk\u2019s silly nature is expressed through her facial expressions, such as her seal clapping and her amazing expression after getting flicked in the forehead by Nico. You can also see the build up before someone starts breaking down into tears, first by their obvious attempts at holding back the tears, until finally you are greeted with the ugliest crying face ever.\\n\\n\r\nMusic:\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes the music in Love Live unique is that only people who watched the show will probably listen to the music. Idol music is very niche and before watching Love Live, I wasn\u2019t into idol music whatsoever. I thought it was too simple and too cringey. While I still think that way about most idol music, there are a few songs that I actually listen to a decent amount nowadays, and not because they are different from the usual idol music in the show, but because of the context behind the pieces.\\n\\n\r\nSongs like Snow Halation and START DASH!! didn\u2019t appeal to me by themselves, but once I witnessed the context behind those two pieces in the show, I started to like them. Also, Love Live uses its idol music in ways that if you like the show and the story, you will like the music. Stuff such as using the OP theme of the first season as the encore for \u03bc's\u2019s \u201cfinal\u201d concert, and using Aishiteru Banzai, a song we heard in the first episode and a personal fave of mine, as the graduation music in the final episode of Season 2. Love Live puts a lot of emotional connection to a lot of would-be average songs, and that\u2019s what makes Love Live\u2019s music memorable in the end. \\n\\n\r\nReflection:\\n\\n\r\nLove Live is bad and you should feel bad, but feeling bad has never felt so good. Easily one of the most satisfying series I\u2019ve ever watched, Love Live fulfills a lot of simple wishes, such as seeing a group of friends start from humble beginnings and becoming international stars, seeing even the coldest of bitches open their hearts to become lovable characters, stuff like that. Stuff that has been done over and over again, but for some reason you especially want it to happen to these 9 girls. And then after an emotional scene, they bring it full circle with the first song you ever hear. Stuff like that makes the first time watching it unforgettable, and makes the first time rewatching it that much more spectacular. \\n\\n\r\nAt least, that\u2019s what happened to me. Not everyone will experience the same things I did, in fact, most of you probably won\u2019t. However, Love Live is definitely one of those shows that has the possibility of changing your life. When you ask for better or worse, I\u2019d probably have to lean towards the latter, for some people then fall into the idol hell known as School Idol Festival, and I hear that there is no escaping that place. And even if you don\u2019t get your life changed, at least you indulged in some top quality memes.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR:\\n\\n\r\nStory: Love Live sucks balls, way too sappy and melodramatic. However, it eventually drops this and becomes a passage of time anime to the likes of K-On, and the drama becomes more natural with positive outcomes. \\n\r\nCharacters: Waifus? Memes? Why not both? A cast of characters that constantly clash with each other, yet eventually become a team where every member feels irreplaceable.\\n\r\nArt: CG. And shitty artwork when the camera zooms. Other than that, it\u2019s ok, and the facial expressions make everything daijoubu. \\n\r\nMusic: Will either make you cringe or cry a river of tears, especially once you know the context behind some of the songs.\\n\\n\r\nIndividual Ratings:\\n\r\nLove Live! School Idol Project: 4/10\\n\r\nLove Live! School Idol Project 2nd Season: 7/10\\n\r\nLove Live! The School Idol Movie 7/10\\n\\n\r\nMy favorite part of the show: Characters.\\n\r\nMy least favorite part of the show: How they handled the drama in season 1.\\n\r\nAnd of course, order of grills (Keep in mind that I like all of them):\\n\r\nUmi > Honk > Nico > Kotori > Eli > Maki > Rin > Nozomi > Hanayo.\\n\\n\r\nFun fact! The Love Live franchise as a whole, including Sunshine, has like zero consistency in terms of clothing. Characters randomly change outfits mid scene.\\n",

            "content": "Full of mirth and passion! Love Live! made me grin from root to seed and had me anticipated about something   other than food.  Yes, I swear by my marmalade that that is true.\r\nSound- 9 out of 10\r\nSince this is an idol anime, the music and the sound are one of its crucial parts.  Well, how should I put it- the music gave me happy vibes.  I was compelled to jump up and dance around my room every time one of the songs came up, and they are idol songs, which is a little bit strange.  First off, I feelthat a lot of idol songs are \"meh\"; uninteresting, shallow, are so passionate and remarkable that they are out of my league, even if the singers are only a few years older than me.  How would you know what a great future feels like, when you are a newbie and most of your happiness is superficial? That was the thing.  The songs in this anime weren't superficial. They were wonderful and realistic, and made me feel like I could relate to them.  Secondly, the voice acting was vewy vewy cute, and the way the characters sang the songs made it convincing that they were the ones singing the song.  The BGM was punctual, and the OST was very satisfying.  So, this anime already fulfills the sound category.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation: 9 out of 10\\n\r\nThe art is fantastic!  It is nothing close to moe- not all of the characters are flat-chested, but there is no ecchi-type fanservice either.  For the concerts, the outfits were very fashionable and stylish.  The companies also gave the characters day to day outfits, besides their school uniform.  Colorful and energetic gym outfits, simple yet sophisticated night clothes- sometimes their hairdos changed!  The animation was varied and very steady.  However, there is one complaint that I had.  Was there 3-d animation in the dance sequences?  It certainly looked like there was.  Now, you're probably wondering, \"What was wrong with the 3-d?\" Hehe, nothing; I'm just kind of sentimental toward them.  The 3-d had perfect timing with the regular animation, and there was nothing inconsistent about them; I just feel awkward about CGs unless it's Disney Pixar.  I'm sorry!\\n\\n\r\nStory- 9 out of 10\\n\r\n\"Otonokizaka High School has recently had a status quo of lesser high school students willing to enroll in it.  Due to this, it is going to close once all the current students have graduated.  A group of girls are against this, and so they all want to do something to prevent it from closing.  What do they decide to do? Become school idols to attract popularity to it!\"  As you can see right now, this plot is nothing out of the box and typical for a slice-of-life and music anime.  On the other hand, that is not all it is.  The characters face actual and realistic problems obstructing the path of their goal, and at times they don't get what they expected.  While watching this anime, I never felt that their successes were patronized, and that their hopeless incidents were not dire enough.  I was always anxious about what would happen next, and felt that the resolution was wrapped up nicely after I finished watching it.  Oh, and how I was sad about finishing it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9 out of 10\\n\r\nThis was probably the most enjoyable aspect of Love Live! for me.  Honoka was a really passionate, energetic girl who reminded me once again that hard work pays off.  Umi-chan acted like the elderly sister for Honoka and Kotori when they first started becoming school idols, setting a work schedule for them and checking if they were still following their diet.  Honoka tackles every problem that comes in her way with a fiery spirit, yet she still has her flaws like everybody else.  The characters developed throughout the series, and they were all especially likeable, even if Nico did annoy me sometimes.  The characters upheld the spirit and passion in this anime, and each episode never failed to bring a smile to my face.  They shall forever remain in my girly heart, Amen.\\n\\n\r\nI'll tell you right now: if you didn't enjoy this show in any aspect, then you can never become a fairy, even if you do save your virginity until age 40.  Who wouldn't smile once during this show?  After I finished Love Live!, I cried out with the same devotion that Joan of Arc had bellowed for Jesus before she was finally reduced to ashes.  I cannot tell anyone how spritely I felt during this endearing viewing session, and if I will ever have the same feeling again for any other idol anime I watch.  FINALE  \\n",

            "content": "Many teenagers dream of their high school life as being the best years of their life. There they meet friends who's friendships they keep dear, discover what they honestly want to do with their lives, and to chase their dreams.\r\nBut what if all of this was taken away from you?\r\nThis is exactly what happens to our main protagonist Kousaka Honoka as she fights to keep her high school dream alive. \r\nThis is my review of the anime hit series: Love Live! School Idol Project\r\n - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Story] - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThis story starts off with the decision that Otonokizaka High School will be closed due to lack of new student applications. Honoka, upon hearing this gets depressed as she wont be able to fully live her high school dream to its full potential as there will be never be any new students/friends to enter the school again. Honoka does not want this to happen and decides that she; with the help of her 2 friends Umi and Kotori will be the ones that save the school from closing. To fulfill this task, she must find a way to attract the attention and influence teens to join her school. How will she do that? Well, what attracts students more then new school pop idols?! Thus, the school idol group 'Muse' was born.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, I felt hesitant when I first approached this anime. I was never really interested in idol genre because generally the music played in them I felt were all generic and too cliche. If I were not to stumble over a Reddit post showing how 'Long Live! School Idol Project' sold a tremendous amount of copies its first week, I might have never came across this anime..  but i'm really glad I did.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough this genre generally has a bad name in terms of plot, this anime executes it quite nicely. This story was interesting because it felt relatable as it touches on many themes that we face in our everyday life such as hard work, perseverance, and the dreams we hold dear. As a student that is still in high school currently, I feel that I have dealt with these themes myself at least once in my high school life, which makes the story even more reassuring as I can relate to it and its characters as a student/viewer. Even though these themes aren't elaborated as much as I wish they did, it was still great to see that this anime contained an interesting plot, and how we can learn from this story as opposed to the usual cute girls doing cute things because well... you know... they're cute. Not that i'm opposed to that, as sometimes those can be a good watch when your in the mood. (Please don't kill me moe army.)\\n\\n\r\n[Art] - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe overall art style of this anime is above average. For a show created in 2013, I've seen some of our current year anime's with lower quality art then this.That is definitely reassuring as there's no drop in quality and is quite balanced in terms of quality distribution throughout the anime. During the live shows, the dance scenes are super cute, and ultimately provide for a nice viewing experience that never ceased to stop me from watching these scenes with a slight smile. It also impressed me on how they change the art style when the live shows happen. They turn all of the idols into 3 dimensional characters instead of the usual 2D throughout the anime. I felt that this was a very cool change and implemented a stronger impact during the live scenes as it always got me excited whenever they decided to perform.\\n\\n\r\n[Sound] - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nFor an anime that prides itself on being in the idle genre, I expected there to be tons of new and exciting songs that would keep me interested throughout the story. I wasn't disappointed. The music they sang were lively and spirited. It really got me pumped up when they started singing, and the live performances never ceased to stop me from humming along with the tune. The idol's voices were beautiful and strong as well, that managed to leave an impact on me with the resonant songs they sang.  I felt the songs that they sang were always full of fun, and you could tell that they were originally made too as it didn't seem too professional but also not too amateurish as well. An example of this would be this series opening \"Bokura wa Ima no Naka de\" by non other then 'Muse'. I really enjoyed the impact of the opening of this song. The tune is extremely catchy and I often found myself humming along with the opening as each episode began. Overall I was quite impressed with the music in this anime, as it was something that made this anime stand out and shine. (Something people can't really say about all Idle anime today, as some of them don't really focus on the music part as much anymore)\\n\\n\r\n[Character] - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAll the Idol's found within this anime are all lovable in their own way. They each portray a different quality that makes them somewhat unique. Even though they might be put into a generic archetype, that doesn't mean that it is all there is to them. The thing i'm impressed with, is the amount of character development that our Idols go through. During the beginning of the story, we can definitely tell that these 3 girls did not really look like they were idol material and it certainly didn't feel like they wanted to be one. With hard work and perseverance, they were able to take on this incredible difficult task by setting aside their differences on the topic at hand. The dramatic moments in the story also have a greater impact because we can relate to these characters and situations as we've most likely gone through the same hardships numerous times before. High school life. I feel that many of us have felt the emotions that have come with it far too many times. This helps us feel stronger emotions toward these characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing I felt was problematic, was how the situation played out too perfectly. It seemed that the idea of becoming idols was just a random idea thrown out of the blue from Honoka. Yet, these 3 students who've never even sang on stage, trained professionally as a singer/dancer, and only practiced with no help whatsoever can do it perfectly just like that? Is that all there is to an idol? Probably not. It could be that they just don't want us to think about it too much as it is probably not that big of a deal, but it just kind of left me wondering.\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment/Overall] 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed watching this anime alot. Sure, I did feel kind of embarrassed as this was the first idle anime that I've ever watched, but i'm really glad I did. Now, I'll be less hesitant to try anime like these because some of them are definitely worth watching like this. For all of the people that enjoy idol anime, I would definitely recommend this and to the people who are curious/worried about this anime because of its genre, i'd say give it a shot. I know you can't hate something that you haven't watched, but that goes the same way with anime that you like.",

It bring more classic humor which i loved and from time to time a character will speak in English in different situation.

            "content": "My first review, yes. With spoilers. Please keep in mind that this review may NOT be organized, or properly done, or came from a weird perspective.\r\nLove Live! School Idol Project is obviously about school idols and stuff. This is the first anime I've watched in the school idol genre. And I can say I liked it. eh.\r\nSo let's start. :o\r\nStory: 8\r\nThe story is quite normal and simple: \"Plz prevent school shut down\". And the students are getting worked up on finding possible 'solutions' to prevent it from happening. Kousaka Honoka sees an idol group and decides to make one.\r\nAs the story progresses, the focus onsome characters are being lost. *spoilers* *spoilers* At first it was only the trio. I loved it since that part. Actually could've been better if they remained as 3. (which means more character exposure).\\n\r\nAlso timeskips exist. \"Last week's episode: 123123 months away from Event X. Today's episode: 2 days away from Event X\". Well, yes I'm exaggerated it, but I believe you get my point. (?)\\n\r\nAlso, some of these problems arise (A-RISE) when half of the season is over (e.g. Kotori leaving the country)\\n\r\nSome events happen unexpectedly (dropping out, Kotori leaving, Eri Ayase), and some are seen coming (getting sick, not gonna be shut down). Some episodes end abruptly. (beach episode)\\n\r\nThe ending is the typical happy ending, where everything is going bad then Superman comes and saves the day.\\n\r\nAs I expected. Everything I've seen about this anime before I watched it gave me the feeling that \"this anime won't end sad, there's no way\". Well except Madoka though, it gave me a false impression. \\n\r\nI also like how they provide little to no fanservice at all. \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR : Story\\n\r\nJust like life. Ups and downs occur everywhere.\\n\r\nIt's good as it is simple. I still enjoyed the story, given some 'flaws' I found.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\\n\r\nEh. While all of the characters have unique characteristics to them, things come up just abruptly.\\n\r\nWe can see that some characters have some 'things' about/of them that count as information for the character\\n\r\nSome characters don't have those 'things'. Oh yeah, we know that they are X's friend/Student Council VP/Pro-archer, but anything else, naaah. Also, are the members of the group born-talented or something? Some characters aren't shown singing or have an interest in dancing but shows good performance otherwise.I guess the motivation the group provides is quite great that everyone learns in a few days. Whatever. My POV anyway.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR : Characters\\n\r\nEveryone is unique, yet some lack background.\\n\\n\r\nSound : 10\\n\\n\r\nOh yes. u's' music is what made me watch this anime. I've been hearing u's' music in the game \"osu!\" and I can say that I liked their songs. Their songs are happy (usually more than 180BPM i think), and are really catchy. The one I found I liked the most was \"Bokura no LIVE Kimi to no LIFE\". That song is the shiet. o/. Their music is good, great or even splendid.\\n\r\nThe voice actors/seiyuu did a good job (for me). I liked Nozomi and Maki's voice for an unknown reason. All other characters' voices are fine. Though I find that (very little) Kotori's and Rin's voices quite annoying. Dunno. \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR : Sound\\n\r\nI love their music. And the actors' voices.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\\n\r\nAnother reason why I watched this anime. The art. I liked how they do the faces,  though given that they are not very unique. The color schemes are okay. Another big factor was the animation used for the PVs. Though running at somewhere at 15-20FPS, it was eyecandy. I never took my eyes of the screen when they're performing. I also like how they do the faces when the characters are frustrated or getting, uh. done by Nozomi. Yes. :3.\\n\\n\r\nThe surroundings are nothing special. Could be the typical.\\n\r\nSo yeah. Art is great.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR : Art\\n\r\nAwsum animation. Especially the PVs. Beautiful art style. Aaaa I love it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime from the part where Honoka acted like 'aaa just a dream nothing to worry about'.\\n\r\nIf I find things like an anime that is interesting, I will watch it. This has piqued my interest long ago.\\n\r\nThe part I enjoyed the most were the PVs, and the 'sad' parts. They make you want to find out what's going to happen after this event and etc. Overall, I enjoyed it. It's K-ON but only with school idols, no instruments, and more members (and the situation that you dropped out from a contest and your school is going to be shut down soon)\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: Enjoyment\\n\r\nEnjoyed it. :o Very.\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah. First noob review conducted. Looking forward to season 2.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\n46/50 = 92%\\n\r\nI'm used to giving high scores. Eh. GG.\\n",

            "content": "I know what you're thinking...And stop it.\r\nRecently I've been on a sort of 'binge watch' of anime; but not just any anime, I'm talking about the type with no plot, high school girls doing crazy things, minor fan service, why? Because after a tough day of college the LAST thing I want to do is put on an episode of Serial Experiments Lain, right?\r\nBut what if I told you that there exists a moe idol show with so much more to offer than meets the eye? A show with so much heart, passion and hard work put into it, that it has actually bustled itsway into my shortlist of favorite anime of all time?\\n\r\nWell, such an anime does exist, Ladies and Gentlemen, I present to you, my review, of 'Love Live: School Idol Project' as well as it's second season.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 8/10:\\n\r\nA lot of people like to compare this anime to a little known anime known as K-On! , but in reality, Love Live is so much more.\\n\r\nOur main character, Honoka Kousaka, finds out that her beloved high school will be shut down next semester due to poor application rates, and discovers the reason for this is because of a brand new high school called 'ITX' which is home to Japan's biggest school idol group known as 'A-RISE'.\\n\r\nNaturally, Honoka sets herself with the goal of creating her own idol group, not to rival the behemoth that is A-RISE, but to simply keep her school relevant for another year. From then on, we journey with Honoka through the trials and tribulations, hard work, and sad moments everyone must go through to finally see their goals come to light.\\n\r\nPersonally, my only 'problem' with the pacing of K-On! Was just how seamlessly quick and easy a group of moe blob ditzy girls became a famous girl band, no emotion, nothing. On the other hand, even the latter third of Love Live's 3rd episode comes filled with sadness, helping you understand what it is you're getting into, and for that, I am thankful.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10/10:\\n\r\nI just...\\n\r\nOkay, it's pretty much standard fare that every idol has to look vastly different to the others in order to check off the anime girl stereotype check list and appeal to as many fetishes as possible - I'm not into that.\\n\r\nWhat I AM into is great ANIMATION, and Love Live does not let me down on that part! You can expect some sort of high production value from a studio like Sunrise  but this was just ridiculous. Each and every scene looks beautifully colorful, vibrant, and all round pleasant to look at, but where the animation goes above and beyond is during the performance scenes; masterfully executed scenes of CGI inter-spliced in between animated frames make the choreography look unbelievable, arguably the best and most appropriate use of CG in any anime ever.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10/10:\\n\r\nAs I stated in my previous review, I'm fluent in both English and Japanese; and therefore I can give a more accurate viewpoint on the dub than others who don't blah blah blah.\\n\r\nWe'll start off with the voice acting. As it stands, there is no English dub, and for a show like this, I don't think there will ever be one, every character is voiced by their real life counterpart which I thought was a nice touch, and so I don't think anyone can criticize the choice of voice acting.\\n\r\nBUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, the music, ah yes, the music!\\n\r\nMy god.\\n\r\nBasically, all you NEED to know is that the singles they used for the anime was perfection, and each song kicks major ass, a song is rarely ever repeated in the same season which means you get fresh off the batch music nearly all the time.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10/10:\\n\r\nNICO NICO NII~\\n\r\nThe series has a mere 26 episodes to fully develop and extract emotion from 9 whole main characters, which averages out at less than 3 episodes per character, but you know what? Even though characters like Hanayo and Rin don't even get that many episodes, their stories are all beautifully executed, some even managing to force a tear from me.\\n\r\nThe one character that I felt wasn't developed as well as I would have liked was that of my favorite girl in anime, Nico Yazawa.\\n\r\nYou see, you see small flashbacks of how tough her life has been, such as a brief 5 second time skip of all of her club members leaving her to be alone for the entirety of her high school life, and I'm sure some of us here know how tough THAT is.\\n\r\nI wish some things were better explained, but what we did get was beautiful, and managing to do what they did with such a large cast was a masterstroke.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9/10:\\n\r\nThis show caught me off guard, I wasn't expecting to got what I got at all, a show with so much more than it's genre will let off, a show that leaves pretty much every other music-based anime in the dust.\\n\r\nWhat Love Live accomplishes is a heart-warming story of friendship, hard work, failure, perseverance and most importantly, passion. The characters aren't just cardboard cut-outs, however some of the things they do and say can be somewhat cheesy.\\n\r\nThis show is not perfection, however. As I mentioned, the story is very basic, and while it does expand upon it's initial goal, I still feel like there is more to come, and more that could have been done, in a story with 9 girls who successfully played with my emotions.\\n\r\nWatch it.\\n\r\nLove it.\\n\r\nNever regret it.",

            "content": "Lets just say that this show did not live up to the hype or standards that I had been lead to believe.\r\nI knew about the story coming in. A school is shutting down in a couple years due to the lack of enrollment. A group of girls realize that the most popular school also happens to have the most popular school idol group. So their like, \"shoot we can do that. and then the school will be saved.\" And then they do that. End of story. the rest of the show is them gathering new members and fighting against the administration who wont let themtry to save the school for some reason. \\n\\n\r\nThe music in the show is so meh. The songs are well made but that's the problem. These are, in kayfabe, supposed to be high school girls producing a perfectly made song. Also during the performances the animation cuts to some horribly moving cg. Not only does it look bad, but it moves at a different frame rate, or something, than the rest of the show and its a bit shocking every time. \\n\\n\r\nComing in, I saw that Nico was pretty much the fan favorite. This is not cause she's cool. It is probably because she actually has a character. Shes and the student president are of few in the show that actually do. Everyone else is either very one dimensional or tropey. I think my enjoyment of the show was harmed because I did not like a single character in the show. \\n\\n\r\nBy the first couple of songs, which are in universe huge hits, you realize that this is just a product meant to sell merch and not really an anime. It has no interest in being an anime. Once this glass shattered, it becomes very hard to watch the rest of the show. You realize that no conflict will stay a conflict for long and everything will work out. By the end, the show leaves you with a cliffhanger to watch the second season. No thanks. \\n",

            "content": "This is my actual first Idol anime and I'm not that disappointed how it is done (It has a little bit of spoiler, but only one, if you do want to continue. Go on!). This can be a borderline above average in my opinion that will satisfy you just fine. At first I was so hesitant whether to watch it or not. Then it took me two days until I went to watch it. The art of course draws me in xD and yes I'm kind of picky when it comes to anime art. Now that I'm done with my random rant, let's get started.\r\nAsI watched this anime, I recalled an anime that was similar to this and especially the three main characters we were introduced in the first episode: Honoka, Kotori, and Umi. K-On comes to mind when I watched the first three episodes or so. Being Honoka as Yui, Kotori as Mugi, and Umi as our shy Mio chuan xD. All of them remind me this anime and some of the characters do have little resemblance of the latter band members of K-On.\\n\\n\r\nThe storyline is not the worst or the best, as I have said earlier this anime will satisfy the viewer enough to humour its audience. It started with our three main characters and Honoka being the one who ls quiet devoted to her school. She decided to stop this school from shutting down. She began to think with good ideas to halt this plan. We see the girls\u2019 hard work to attain their goal which is similar to K-On; although with different goals on both animes. We also see the realism in this anime such as having an obstacle to become an idol and a little drama of course. Same as K-On's hard work can get you rewarded a lot better. Friendship also develops to most of them which has a decent pace. So 7/10 is my score for the storyline.\\n\\n\r\nArt, yes! Art! The nine girls are very well drawn and it pleases me as I watch every episode. MOE! MOE MOE GOODNESS to Nico Nico nii LOL! Although it's not the best, but it's rather decent! This is borderline the best that's what I could say about this. The dances are fluid but it kinda disappoints me at some point, when they switch to CG and back to normal animation. I think that one is a flaw in the anime even I would want to see it in normal animation. Maybe is not a flaw at the same time. Well it could be because of the budget and I couldn't blame them to go to that route. The shifting of animation is apparent and I hope it stayed in the original animation. Yet it's still good and not bad. K-On is far the best for me. What is funny is that I never skip the opening song for this anime and I enjoy seeing them dance xD, so it is 8/10 for me, I only set aside the thought of CG when I watch it.\\n\\n\r\nSound, I'm not that very fond of Idol songs I guess, but I do enjoy seeing them sing. Although neither nor of their songs are downloaded to my QQ music ==', so it's average to my liking and 7/10 for the sound.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter! I'm really biased, so this is most to my bias opinion, but before we get to that I will at least list what I have found lacking in this anime or I won't even mention my really bias opinion xD. Not most of the characters are really well introduced, which I only see is Honoka's, her little background, but the other characters are...upsetting. We do not know much of them. The first three characters aren't introduced much, and some of our main characters. We do know a little and that is to that, it just went on until the anime is finished. I didn't know Kotori's mom was the chairwoman of the school. LOL! That shocked me a little until Eri pointed out in one of the episodes. The author didn't put too much effort on introducing to the characters, so it's a downfall for this anime, sadly == and 6/10 for this one. I have noticed that they lack of male characters, if they ever show them, which that don\u2019t show their eyes. A good example is Honoka's father and this show is really biased to women. Hopefully at least they added one or two males, and they interact to one of the characters. In addition, I like Honoka's flaw of her character, the little touch of realism has a good impact in the anime.  It's not only about aiming something for her own reasoning, but it teaches us that be considerate to the people's feeling. This kind of point in our life sometimes is inevitable, so it gives a great moral too in this anime. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, I did enjoy more of their humours xD. Airheaded Honoka is priceless, witty and short-tempered Nico catches my whole attention (my favourite character and next is Maki LOL), and their ridiculous antics of some of the characters has made me like this anime. The perfs are enjoyable, but the CG, WHY??? What I kinda hate it's too centralize to most of Honoka's life xD. Thus I'm giving this 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall! I will give it 7.5, no, I can just round it to 8, if only decimals are added to marking system in this site. I'm not saying that this is terrible. This can satisfy you at least and for me it's borderline above average. The story is kind of moving at some point, the art isn't bad, the sound is fine, the character development is upsetting, and finally the enjoyment is pretty decent. That's my long review for this anime and it has given you a little of what's going on here.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I'm a big fan of the Love Live franchise, so I'm sorry if I look like a mired person or with bad judgment, but the truth is that I like all seasons of Love Live (including Sunshine and the movie). But that does not stop me from wanting to give my opinion about this anime.\r\nHistory:\r\nLove Live is an anime that does not have a deep, ingenious or innovative story. This does not make this point weak or anything like that, the series creates a simple story for the characters to \"develop\" the way they see fit. The story is developed based on training and traininguntil you can perfect a choreography. The story is not more than that, a day by day of 9 girls who give their best effort to achieve a goal, but it is more than that, the events that arise in history make it good in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nThere are moments like the first concert they do that showed me how serious the girls were, the story does not want them to be the best ones singing automatically or because they are school idols stand out in a first concert, that's why the first concert was a total disaster (although Star Dash is one of the favortias songs of the fans), because it has to be, a group of idols is not done from one day to the next, that would be totally illogical. Although the time spent in choreography, costumes and calling people for the concert was totally useless they did not give up, they had a credible goal and an \"answer\" to their problem also credible, it was admiracion and hard work, it has not but, at no time I find it strange that being school idols was something stupid or irrational, the world that presents Love Live makes it totally clear that school idols of that age are very normal and attract public, being a school idol is simply something that would assure (for Honoka) attract public, under that point of vsita it sounds very credible that she has been serious about being a school idol and convince her friends to do it, because that way the chances of saving the school increase significantly and, something that I consider important even in real life, they could turn their responsibilities into something special and very comfortable for them.\\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe characters (along with the music) is what gives Love Live the essence, since the main objective of Love Live was always to produce good music and create very \"beautiful and tender\" characters to make the aesthetics of music have cohesion and so make both components are in a way that the public likes and can make any of the 9 girls in the group are liked by someone. And the 9 girls together form the group u's\\n\\n\r\nThe Love Live characters share the same goal or main objectives as the others, this is something that is obvious taking into account that all live in the same school and that same school will close.\\n\\n\r\nHonoka Kousaka: she is a character who has the character of a boss, not because of being bossy or being a kind of drastic boss, she is simply determined and cheerful, which I like, is like what I said before; she transforms her responsibility into a way to get closer to her friends and a way to have fun. Honoka is the typical person who is always happy and knows how to make her group happy, and there is the grace of the characters, to take types of people to make a group of idols more diverse and with different and at the same time similar personalities. Honoka works very well as head of the group, I do not have much more to say about her; She is friendly, kind, often funny and very determined to fulfill her goals (although in a certain part of the Honoka series she became very depressed and left the group for a while). Simply a character with good function of boss and who manages to become more responsible in the second season to be president of the student council, so she learned to tormase more seriously their responsibilities.\\n\\n\r\nUmi Sonoda: is the typical girl who is good at sports and academically, Umi is the childhood friend of Honoka and Kotori, so their closeness with both characters is very present in the series, Umi despite being another type of common girl in animes does not take away the merit, this is due to his participation in the group and his way of helping the group.\\n\r\nUmi is a very shy girl who dislikes wearing mini skirts for concerts, but due to the insistence of her best friends she decides to put on the clothes she thought was shameful, Umi demonstrates in the first instance to be a good friend and shows it With all the other girls that join the group, Umi is a character that is distinguished from the other characters because of how indecent finds things like kisses or that indole, this causes pretty funny moments in the series (like when they are watching a novel), Umi has a very strong personality and fulfills his goal of trying to be different from the other characters (although it looks like Maki, they turn out to be very different), it shows the love that has Honoka and Kotori for be childhood friends,and Umi likes to practice archery.\\n\\n\\n\r\nKotori Minami: she is in charge of the creation of the costumes for all the concerts, so it can be said that she is one of the most important in the series. Kotori shows (just like Umi) the affection she has for Honoka, I emphasize this because it is very important, it would not make sense if they are friends from childhood and they do not show a credible friendship for what they have been together, their friendship It has to be made credible, this is achieved through their friendly dialogues and the memories they have of their childhood (especially the one that show a time when they climb a tree and Kotori and Umi scares them), I consider the friendships of these 3 girls very well achieved, many people may say that cliche, but that is irrelevant, taking into account that the story tells the day to day of a group of idols and adding the fact that they are normal people is a cliche well implemented, is that they simply showed their relationship in a simple way as people in their day to day, the moment that Kotori has to go proves it even more, Honoka gives all their effort to convince Kotori to stay in Japan , And it is Kotori has other motivations besides saving the school, she wants to be a designer, that would give her reasons to join the group of idols. Kotori is the personage of the series that demonstrates to have more motivations in addition to saving the school and it is possible to appreciate his great friendship with Umi and (especially) with Honoka. despite that she does not have a personality \"as\" marked as the other girls, Kotori is more responsible and somewhat more shy than the others (she is almost as responsible as Umi), but what differentiates her from the others are her goals and things what she does (make the wardrobe, want to be a professional designer and be a kind of \"maid\" in a local).\\n\\n\r\nRin Hoshizora: Rin is a first year at the Otonokizaka academy, it is one of the smallest members of the group, it is often childish (but without falling into stupidity imensa). Rin is quite extravaganten his mania to finish his sentences with \"nya\" also comes to be a type of girl known in Japan (come on, the typical \"Neko girls\"), so they did the right thing by making Rin the most childish member and the smallest of the group, because although it is unnatural to listen to someone finish the sentences with nya, the series wants this to go more unnoticed and not feel forced, this because the series does not give emphasis to its strange mania to say nya, so if someone came to dislike it would be very easy to ignore.\\n\r\nRin is also one of the members of the most sensitive group (only surpassed by Hanayo) and that is noticeable since she was little, because she was annoyed to look like a man, which caused a constant denial when talking about her beauty, even saying that She was not pretty enough to be able to enter a group of idols, it's not a traumatic past or anything like that, it just caused her great insecurity, the bad thing is that it may seem quite exaggerated. Rin manages a good relationship with almost everything (if not all) the group, this is because she always tries to have fun and it feels good to have that support in the group, it is as if she often raised spirits (despite the fact that she often gets sad), but she proves to be mature when she has to be mature (especially when she had to be the center in a song).In spite of everything, it takes time for Rin to find a real reason to belong to the group, since she joined the group only because Hanayo did it.\\n\\n\r\nHanayo Koizumi: she is the most timid member, that is the basis of her main charm, we must give special emphasis on her shyness, because that is what stands out the most.\\n\r\nHanayo has several good relationships with Maki and Rin (those of her school year), Hanayo had a great affection for school idols, even she was one of the few that came face to face in the first concert of the u's (since all the others were hidden). Hanayo is a friend of Rin since they are small, that is why they are always together and that several times they meet together, often both find themselves progressing to be better school idols, but that is not why Hanayo does not have good relations with the others members, Maki is someone who can hit Hanayo a lot in terms of personality, but that does not distance them or anything like that, both, being first year, they get along very well, it is natural that in Love Live the members that belong to the same year get along, because they have the same class in common, but outside the school, Hanayo still gets along well with Rin and Maki, Hanayo being shy does not speak much, but with Maki and Rin speaks a lot, that She already says a lot about her relationship as friends.\\n\r\nAfter a while, when Hanayo gets used to doing concerts, she changes her attitude and does not feel ashamed to sing and dance in front of many people, on the contrary, seeing things from her in stores is joyful and emotional, so in the story could leave his shyness aside\\n\\n\r\nMaki Nishikino: she is very mature, has different hobbies than other members since she knows how to play the piano and is often busy as a resource to make songs, Maki is intelligent, but despite that she believes in things that are childish at her age (Maki believes in Santa), but that does not make her silly, obviously. Maki is the daughter of a millionaire father, although this does not have much relevance in the series it has to be said that at a certain moment the u's go to the summer house of Maki's parents to spend some time (it must be said that in that part they occur many fun moments).\\n\r\nMaki also has a great relationship with (besides her school year) Nico, Maki often has funny conversations with Nico because she can turn out to be very crazy, is how Rin, despite that Maki never says he dislikes being with Nico and Len at certain times are treated very well as friends, Maki manages good control of their friendships.\\n\r\na very remarkable attitude of Maki is that it seems \"tsundere\" and in a moment even Nozomi tells him a comment of that type to laugh at her for a while. This attitude causes that Maki often reacts of graceful form or that says phrase that, at least the fans, consider memorable\\n\\n\r\nEli Ayase: is the president of the student council and one of her first actions in the series is to ban the group that Honoka was planning to do, and at the beginning Eli demonstrates an absolute denial of the formation of the idols club, but through the story advances and due to the determination shown by Honoka, Eli decides to help the group so that they can dance well, Eli changes her mind in a way that is well constructed, she simply decided to help the last hope of her high school (since she was the president then logically it was the most worried).\\n\r\nEli has a very good relationship of friendship with Nozomi, the viscepresident of the student council, Eli knows Nozomi since they are small and in short, it happens the same as with the other members, when they know each other since childhood their friendship is very well achieved and demonstrates in a very credible way, especially by the way they help at certain times.\\n\r\nEli also has a more firm and responsible personality, she is not strict (the strict one of the group is Umi), but she often shows her great concern for the group, even though at the beginning she wanted to prohibit the club of idols\\n\\n\r\nNozomi Tojo: is undoubtedly the wisest and smartest member of a group, even before joining the group of idols she helped giving advice, as I said, Nozomi has a close relationship of friendship with Eli since they are small, but all members of u's have a lot of respect for Nozomi, that's not why they have a more formal relationship, but they do estimate it a lot (in a chapter Maki finds out about Nozomi's past and feels that she can get along better with her).\\n\r\nNozomi also has a very strong personality, as already mentioned is wise, but besides that she likes to joke with the members of the group, thus playing a good role of \"counselor\" and how a very good friend to have fun.\\n\r\nNozomi, has a past that is not the big thing or something deep, but it serves to better understand the reason that gets along so well with Eli, Love Live in general stands out for the relationships formed by the characters and how they are shown Throughout the series, with Nozomi they chose to use another flashback to demonstrate the beginning of their relationship.\\n\r\nNozomi also has the habit of grabbing other people's chest, it's weird, but when he used that it gave me grace\\n\\n\r\nNico Yazawa: Nico is the member of u that most admired by the school idols has, at first part hating the group of idols saying they are mediocre, but then he has to give the club to Honoka, Nico felt the same as Eli, he disliked the fact that there was an idol club, but for totally different reasons. Nico had previously formed a group of idols that had come far and Nico was emotionally excited by the fact that his dream was becoming reality, but the other members left, because of that she denies the fact that there is another group of school idols.\\n\r\nNico has a more than justifiable motivation to join the group of idols, she admires the idols in the same way that Hanayo does, that is precisely why Nico and Hanayo become good friends, Nico is the most open member to express herself , she does not feel ashamed when it comes to being idols and that is noticeable when she makes her \"Nico Nico Nii\" to show that she \"knows\" to be an idol.\\n\r\nNico in general is more similar to Rin, both are very crazy and funny, but Nico takes his idol job very seriously.\\n\\n\r\nBeing Love Live a series that focuses a lot on the charm of the characters is normal to try to make them more distanced in terms of design is concerned (and if it does not do so by personality). This is an excellent factor taken by the series, since, regardless of whether his personality is distinctive or not of the character, his design will make him feel more detached and special.\\n\r\nIn Love Live the designs of the 9 girls is done in a very good way, they did not try to make the designs very strange, they put an exact amount of intonation to the colors to make the hair and the eyes of a color neither realistic nor unreal.\\n\r\nIt is also worth mentioning that the characters are also distinguished by the excellent work of the dubbing actors (or seiyuus) that make the voice feel different from the other members (which was to be considered taking into account the budget behind it). ). In my opinion as far as designs are concerned, Love Live did it very well, knew how to create a nice design for the view and knew how to take advantage of the lyrics or \"aesthetics\" of their songs to make characters that in my opinion are very charismatic and distanced from others, very good characters.\\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nRhythm and events of the story:\\n\r\nLeaving aside that which I just told about the ed u's members, it is also worth mentioning how to develop the story based on them, they constantly have scenes that demonstrate their passion for what they do and their bonds of friendship achieved with time together.\\n\r\nSuch ephemeral scenes as the flash-backs that have until more transcendental moments like when the u's present their first concert, all those parts are important for the plot, not only because they cause a change in the way of training or to see the work of being idol, but also because you can get to emphasize more with all the members of the group, that's why they have so many different hobbies\\n\r\nand they get to know each other throughout the series. With everything said then you can see a very good convinacion or \"synergy\" on the part of the members demonstrating that although the work of idol is difficult, they continue to strive and continue to advance naturally, they simply combine with each other, all are different, but try to fit for the same goal, become school idols\\n\\n\r\nEvents happen at a good speed for what is normally offered by a series that presents the day to day of a group of idols.\\n\r\nThe series is well accompanied by moments where the u's make concerts, making the soundtrack good and the series is not monotonous, there will always be a song to raise the mood at certain times.\\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nanimation and soundtrack: \\n\r\nHow I mentioned the soundtrack is very good in the series due to how the series makes the u's have a workout and then a dance, try to make the different songs, the soundtrack of Love Live is good because that's what the series is based on, music.\\n\r\nThe animation is in CGI due to the difficulty to animate dance movements, but the scenarios in which the dances take place, the same dances that make tune with the music make it something remarkable, it is not at all an easy job to animate dances and final does not end badly. Animation is well achieved for how complex it is.\\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI enjoyed the series very much, it calms me a lot listening to the songs of the u's\\n\r\nare songs presented in the anime or not, hopefully someone feels the same as I feel with this series, I do not want to sound dramatic, but it generates mixed feelings. Undoubtedly enjoy them, you will especially like if you disriutas the music and you like the characters that go more to the \"cute and tender\" than anything else, but for me no doubt Love Live fulfilled its goal\\n\\n",

            "content": "Memes. You love them or you hate them. You live by them and die with them, or just simply don't care. So you can say... you either Love (and) Live or you don't.\r\nThank you everyone, you can leave the death threats in my comment section.\r\nI put a surprisingly large amount of time into thinking about why do I like Love Live's first season. A lot of thoughts ran through my mind, but overtime all the overthinking bullshit, I realized it's as simple as \"I had fun\".\r\nNot everyone's going to agree with me, but I think watching happy people be happy and achieve their goals isrewarding. Honoka wanting to save her school, finding people to do that with and all of them becoming more open with themselves and other people evokes exactly that.\\n\\n\r\nLove Live is very much capable of creating happy characters and scenarios. There's the dumb and passionate people like Honoka, Rin and Nico, the collected but silly ones like Eri, Umi, Maki and Nozomi, and the shy but cheerful ones like Hanayo and Kotori, and they all find themselves digging into the stereotypes of a happy school life and being an idol, providing for a bunch of rather calming and relaxing episodes. There's a distinct progression to it all too, with more members and the growing happy, somewhat loud atmosphere of a group of friends overtaking the show more and more. It was happy at the start, but it's the middle where all of the characters get to really showcase themselves in casual situations and embrace that happiness to its fullest.\\n\\n\r\nAside from that, I also think Love Live's first season has strong moments of characterization for most of the girls, giving them enough personality to be worth following. There's Honoka with her strong resolve that captured me during the first concert of the group at which any normal person would probably give up. There's Eri looking down on idols as a whole due to their lack of actual skill, but after some time understanding that the most important part of being one is the atmosphere and the fun that comes with it. There's Nico and Hanayo with their life-long dreams of becoming idols, with their own reasons as to why those dreams couldn't become reality sooner. Maki with her enclosed style of life opening up due to the passion for music and friendship she develops throughout this season.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately there's also Umi, Rin, Nozomi and Kotori. In comparison to the others, they feel empty, and that's really meaningful when you understand that the others aren't really \"full\" either. Umi suffers from being sidelined by Honoka, who's always with her, despite having a rather strong presence in the show it's always easy to forget about her. The opposite goes for Rin, who's basically nonexistent. Like, Rin does not exist. And yes, it is annoying to see her still be around despite being nothing. She has one scene to herself, but then she disappears, doesn't contribute to anything meaningful, any jokes, any cute scenes, anything whatsoever. Nozomi on the other hand, has too many scenes. Too many boob grabbing scenes to be exact. I think the idea of her as a hidden mentor, giving backup when needed, was good. That surely helped with turning Maki and Eri into somewhat realized characters. But on the other hand, we have every scene where she tries to be herself. Those scenes consist of:\\n\r\nA. Grabbing boobs\\n\r\nB. Threatening to grab boobs\\n\r\nThat would be about it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally, there's Kotori.\\n\r\nKotori, whose arc was supposed to be the closing one. And oh boy it sure closed with a bang. A bang that would kill the show for a lot of people, that's for sure.\\n\\n\r\nKotori's arc is bad. It is REALLY bad. Admittedly, it's not only her arc, and that's what makes it even worse.\\n\r\nEven before her confession about leaving, we get Honoka pushing herself too hard and getting sick, leading to a gloomy atmosphere in the group. Making Kotori confess her decision in that situation sidetracks both of those seemingly important issues, creates now ones, and making a one huge mess in general. Visibly forced one at that. I mean, this show was so happy before all this,  it's like they force all of the drama they had left in their arsenal. Outside of creating a few cool connections to the second season and the movie, which could've been mentioned in a normal, less dramatic ways too, it has very little purpose. At best, it'll make you sad for the characters that you like, but at worst it'll make you hate numerous characters or the show in general. I'd say that's a pretty poor choice to make there to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nAnd with that being said, I think it's safe to assume that Love Live: The School Idol Project isn't a good show.\\n\r\nBut do I care?\\n\r\nAs if.\\n\r\nLove Live was very enjoyable for 10 episodes or so out of 13. You think I'm going to give it a low score because of two or three episodes?\\n\r\nI've always felt weird when people tell me \"I liked the show, but the ending is why I have it low\". Sure, if it's the artistic quality we're talking about, then by all means, think about it in that context. But this? This is Love Live. It is a meme, it is relaxing fun with cute girls, where would I try to get this value out of? I watch a 13 episodes fun, cute girls show, which was always just that, and then I get both the fun and the cute girls that I think are fun to follow in good doses and so I like it.\\n\\n\r\nOn top of that, it is crafted pretty well. The designs for the girls are cute enough, varying in figure, faces, movement, making for fun interactions on the screen. The show looks very pleasant, with tons of bright colors and the nicely fitting uniforms to complement that. The colors just bounced off of each other so nicely that I honestly couldn't stop looking at it.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's the CGI during performances. In all honesty, I'm very glad that the studio decided to do it the way it did. It allowed for much more freedom in the choreography of the performances, and it really shows, there's a lot of movement and the performances look realistic and coordinated. I hear the issue that the jumps between 2D and 3D faces can be jarring, but I never went through that problem, it's pretty clear and obvious that this is how it's going to be, so I took it in pretty fast.\\n\\n\r\nAnd lastly, the music. The OST is absolutely forgettable background music contributing very little to what's going on. The actual idol songs on the other hand, should be satisfying for anyone new to idols. It's basic stuff, music that you can jump to and wave at a concert. I don't think there were any standouts in particular, but each performance, together with the choreography, made for an entertaining moment in the show, and the songs fit well, especially given their context each time. It gave them that little extra weight.\\n\\n\r\nAnd with all that, I feel safe in stating that Love Live does its job pretty well, setting up a decent foundation for the second season. It's far from being anything more than satisfying. The ending is just an ending, undermines an entire character for the sake of a finish and can definitely throw people off, giving them low expectations and even making them give up on the series in general, but if that's the case, then I just want to point towards the parts that I believe can be genuinely fun - the first 10 episodes. That's some well crafted cute girls stuff, and if that's what you're looking, then it's waiting for you. And then there's the second season, but that's a different story.\\n\\n\r\nAs always, this is purely my opinion. I recommend you to develop your own.",

            "content": "Love Live is everything you think it is from the outset. It\u2019s a high school drama centered on a group of adorable girls becoming idols. It\u2019s nothing new, it doesn\u2019t strive to change the game; yet it still manages to beat the competition as far as I\u2019m concerned. And I\u2019m not familiar with all the competition because I\u2019m not a huge fan of this slice of life/music genre that seems to have cropped up after the success of that one episode of Haruhi Suzumiya and the massive success of K-On. All I know of is the first season of K-On, which is massively hyped up.I reviewed it pretty decently though and in retrospect\u2026I think it\u2019s because I\u2019m a sucker for this moe garbage. I fall for the cute girls just as easily as the rest and even when reviewing some titles I seem to relax my rating because I enjoyed following the cute girls as they do cute things. I\u2019m pathetic, I know.\\n\\n\r\nWhy am I admitting my being a moe blob? Because that\u2019s how I get caught up in these types of anime. My thinking that Azusa was adorable got me watching K-On. My thinking Nico was cute got me watching Love Live. And while Azusa was my favorite character from K-On, Nico is actually not my favorite character from Love Live because she\u2019s kind of a bitch. But that\u2019s beside the point\u2026\\n\\n\r\nLove Live has the same type of set-up as many of these high school drama-y anime. Just like K-On, we follow an idealistic, loud, clumsy, and annoying girl. In Love Live, she decides to start an idol group due to the popularity of these groups around Japan. It\u2019s all a last ditch effort to save her high school which could possibly shut down. She recruits her two best friends, a very boring moe girl named Kotori and the super shy girl, Umi. Umi doesn\u2019t want to perform in a short skirt because that\u2019s embarrassing. Meanwhile, she wears the school\u2019s uniform skirt that, in reality, would be as effective a piece of clothing as not wearing a skirt at all.\\n\\n\r\nThey face all kinds of obstacles such as a really unsavory girl named Nico and a student council president who keeps pushing them aside.\\n\\n\r\nStory-wise, it\u2019s nothing new. The only real plus I can give the story is the fact that the girls actually practice. There are lots of parts that have nothing to do with practicing but the sheer fact that we are given a group of competent girls that are actually trying to succeed at what they are doing makes the anime more enjoyable and gives the audience more reason to invest themselves in the group and hope to see them succeed.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, this is a music anime and I believe that every music anime I\u2019ve ever reviewed I\u2019ve stated one thing:\\n\\n\r\nNOT ENOUGH MUSIC!\\n\\n\r\nThis is the exception. Love Live contains a surprising amount of music. This is an equivalent to America\u2019s High School Musical so it better well have some goddam music. But unlike High School Musical, we\u2019re not subjected to Ashley Tisdale\u2019s nose, which makes this anime a big plus in my book. We\u2019re also not subjected to understandable lyrics, which is probably why I enjoy the music of these types of shows. Let\u2019s face it; the music in Love Live is garbage. It\u2019s bubblegum pop, the kind of stuff you\u2019d expect teenaged girls to write. The meaningless lyrics and nonsensical English words or phrases thrown in are a staple of these types of songs. But it\u2019s what you\u2019d expect from sixteen year old girls and I guess that makes it alright. Start: Dash is pretty catchy and while none of the music may be memorable, at least there is enough of it going around that you get excited for the next piece.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, the music is accompanied by an idol performance most of the time. The animation of this show is usually pretty good with very adorable girls, great backgrounds, and good movement. But the issue comes with these dance performances that become very shoddy CGI mixed with traditional animation sequences. While the animation looks good, the sudden use of something akin to Miku Miku Dance is frustratingly out of place and gaudy. I don\u2019t know who decided to change the style, but fire that person for season two. Please. No more computer animation.\\n\\n\r\nEven with a big cast of really likeable and adorable characters it still fails to impress with anything new. Every character is a stereotypical something-or-other. You have the tomboy, the tsundere (really two of them), the well-to-do upper classman, the pervert, the ditzy leader, the shy and fraidy-cat friend, and the girl with very little personality. Working together, these characters are fun despite some having very little depth. The show does give most of them a good amount of focus and fleshes them out a bit, but they\u2019re, once again, typical. The development they\u2019re given is the usual.\\n\\n\r\nNow for some smaller tidbits of hate: Why do all Russian girls in anime and manga have to be ballerinas? I\u2019m looking at you Black Lagoon, Love Live, and Gunslinger Girl. Also, why the beach episode? If one episode contributed nothing to the anime as a whole it was the beach episode. Also, the drama at the end regarding Kotori was forced and very predictable. The entire outcome was extremely easy to see from a mile away because the same plot device has been used before to the same effects.\\n\\n\r\nSo where does that leave Love Live? Despite the story\u2019s predictability, the characters predictability, and the MMD style dancing, it\u2019s still highly enjoyable. Watching this band of girls come together and work hard to attain a dream is actually kind of heart-warming. The pacing is a little rough and the music isn\u2019t the best but there\u2019s a good amount of music and a good amount of fun to be had. It\u2019s not an anime to be taken seriously, you hop on this ride to meet some new friends and enjoy their interactions and triumphs. It\u2019s no masterpiece by any stretch, but for what it is, it\u2019s a good, though flawed, anime.",

            "content": "I'll keep this as short as possible:\r\nThis is a great anime to watch if you're having IDOLM@STER withdrawals - good music, cute girls, etc. I feel like the girls' struggle in this show is more real - you see them learning to sing, dance, write their own songs, even if it is a bit rushed as others have pointed out.\r\nThe music is very good and honestly I like the way they animated the dancing. The choreography is definitely more interesting/complicated than anything I saw 765 Pro do.\r\nIf you've ever been a performer or had a dream you wanted to accomplish, the story will hit homewith you really hard. I rated it high for this reason.\\n\r\nThe biggest drawback is that the characters are developed very unevenly. IM@S excelled at introducing and developing all 13 girls (to their credit, they did have twice as many episodes to do so), but it also didn't have a central character to push the show along. LoveLive very obviously has a main character, so naturally she (and her two best friends) get the most development. The other girls are likable (Nico grates on me but at least she's entertaining) so here's hoping the second season gives them the treatment they deserve.\\n",

            "content": "**SPOILER ALERT** Contains minor spoilers about the plot as a whole.\r\nI'm sure most of you expect Love Live! to be a group of girls getting together singing and being all moe.... well you're right that's exactly what Love Live is.\r\nIt takes place in the life of Kousaka Honoka who's a second year student in Otonokizaka High School in Akihabara. Having just recieved the news that the school has not reached it's application quota and will therefor be closed at the graduation of the current students she and her two friends Minami Kotori and Sonoda Umi decides to do something about it.\r\nAs they think of whatto do Honoka stumbles upon the idea of becoming Idols which is at first shot down as a poor suggestion but grows on them as they decide to create a group.\\n\\n\r\nAs such they train for their first ever live concert and as such the story begins!\\n\\n\r\nI feel like the story of Love Live! is quite average and while there is nothing extraordinary in it there is no big flaws in it either except for a couple of annoying time skips where you just wish that they had another 3 or so episodes to explain what you missed, which is good considering the story of the show is not it's selling point.\\n\\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nThe producers of Love Live! is Sunrise, Lantis and NIS America and personally I feel like the art and animation is nothing out of the ordinary, that is until they add the 3D which can be found during some sequences in for example performances.\\n\\n\r\nThe 3D transition is down very smoothly and the 3D itself is very well made which makes me feel like I'm really watching something that's a treat for the eyes, combine it with cute girls who sing songs and act all moe and you have yourself a winning concept.\\n\\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nThe other selling point of Love Live! as it's a series about a school idol group is obviously the sound.\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion the OSTs are nothing special and the songs they sing while good are nothing special (except for Start:Dash! but that might just be me).\\n\\n\r\nI do have to give credit though as through the entire main cast there aren't really any big names as most of the VA's are known from this series in specific and some has not even done any other character.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening \"Bokura wa Ima no Naka De\" by \u00b5's  is quite good looking and the song itself sticks very easily and fits with the theme of the show very well causing it to be memorable.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending of Love Live! shifts very often as in the first episode it's \"Susume Tomorrow\" by \u00b5's which quite honestly send shivers down my spine every time I hear it and I'd say it's one of the best endings I've heard so far.\\n\r\nSadly they switch it out after just one episode for\" Kitto Seishun ga Kikoeru\" also by \u00b5's which is sung in different versions in different episodes.\\n\r\nNot to say that the second ending is poor but in comparison to the first the quality pales.\\n\\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the characters go they don't get nearly enough development in this first season which is a bit disappointing but with only 13 episodes and such focus on 3D and sound it's understandable and because of the type of series it is it's actually somewhat acceptable.\\n\\n\r\nHowever my expectations are high for good character development with the second season coming up.\\n\\n\r\nKousaka Honoka: Our MC is an overambitious girl when it comes to things she has passion for however outside of those areas she is quite lazy and likes wasting time however she has a certain charm which allows her to get things her way more often than not which sometimes causes trouble but is also a major factor in the groups success.\\n\\n\r\nMinami Kotori: Kotori is the type of character who is always cheerful and makes sure that the group stays in a good mood, she is very talented all be it she does not see it herself and tries her hardest for her friends, other very similar characters are Asahina Mikuru or Kotobuki Tsumugi.\\n\\n\r\nSonoda Umi: Umi is the responsible of the main-trio and is quite honestly more or less a more daring version of Akiyama Mio with both very similar looks and personality being very dependable, kind, proud and somewhat easily embarassed. Somewhat of a light Tsundere.\\n\\n\r\nAside from these three no other character got nearly enough character development.\\n\\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nFor my personal enjoyment I have to say i was pleasantly surprised as I was expecting another K-on! (which did not please me all that much) but I enjoyed Love Live! a lot and I feel like as a stand alone series the first season ended quite well.\\n\\n\r\nBut with a second season coming up I think that with more character development and a good story they can turn Love Live! into something great and I'm very interested in the second season starting now in Spring 2014.\\n\\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nOverall I'd say Love Live! is a good anime that is worth the watch and I have high expectations for the second season which is incoming.",

            "content": "Hi! Robert's Too Late Review here, throwing down again! Check the synopsis, minor spoilers possible, and to note, I'm talking purely Season 1 for this review, and I'm talking about the dub version. I will try to update and review as I make my way through the rest of the series. Make no bones about it, this anime is silly. Now the question becomes, is it silly fun, or is it just silly? Read on and see if Love Live! School Idol Project makes a spot on the wall of awesomeness!\r\nStory: 9\r\nThis is a music/slice of life series, which should be pretty obvious by thetitle. (at least the music part) The show deals with the girls deciding to shoot for the stars, and the struggles they go through realizing their dreams to be idols. (pop stars is a good equivalent term) The story is fairly predictable, but as I've said before, this doesn't always have to be a bad thing. Just because we realize the general ending early, doesn't mean we cannot enjoy the trip of getting there. Of course the story does toss a few twists at us, though they are softball pitches. However, the girls growing in maturity is still very interesting to watch. \\n\\n\r\nBe warned, I guess this could be considered 'moe' and if that repels you, then you might look to move past this series. The entire thing is covered in a *heavy* layer of sugar sweetness. It is silly, yet inspiring as they move towards their goals and overcome the challenges that try to stop them. If you've ever dreamed of being a member of N*Sync (showing my age I guess) or something like Fifth Harmony, this is a show for you. It's a lot like the driving force behind the Guitar Hero series of games: to vicariously live out your fantasies about being rich and famous. Because that is such a common dream, especially when we're young, this series is wise to appeal to this fantasy and plays it well.\\n\\n\r\nThe only downer to the story is the cliche reason they have for motivating certain members to join the group. Its such an overused trope that I've more than had my fill of this certain form of motivation, because it does seem to be all over anime. It's revealed at the beginning but I'll not spoil it, though I will say the question of 'does anyone go to a school not facing this?' begs to be asked. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nI ADORE the art in this show. It's beautifully drawn, very well animated, and the characters are impressively expressive. There is a lot of blushing, and they pay attention to little details such as the red coloring around the knees, which while not as prominent, is a good example of the quality put into the anime. The eyes on the characters are amazingly well done. The characters clothing, whether it be school uniforms or idol costumes are all detailed and interesting. This is one good looking series!\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nI admit there is a lot of personal preference to be had here. If you want to vomit when you hear the term 'J-pop' then by all means, pass for sure. This show is actually about the girls becoming the pop idols, so naturally there are several performances through to be heard. They are all sugar sweet, and very 'light pop' from a Western point of view. I find this kind of music catchy and entertaining, so I did not mind at all the frequent songs played throughout. As I said, if you don't feel the same, this will be torture to your ears. The theme songs are adorable, the background music awesome, and the voices are all well matched to characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe 'airhead' member (every group has one, be honest now) has a slightly overdone voice in the dub and knocks close to annoying at times, but does sound fitting for exactly how you would expect her to sound. The responsible ones all have older, more mature sounding voices. One of the younger girls has a serious thing for cats, and often meows and such, which is a little irritating but nowhere near deal breaking. Overall the cast is well chosen.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nWe do see a lot of stereotypical characters here, but there's a reason why there are stereotypes, often because when done properly, they work. Of the starting three, we have one mature one, one determined leader, and one airhead who is hardworking and good natured. We then add characters such as the shy freshman, the silly cat freshman, the mysterious senior, the resistant one who happens to be the student council president (of course she is, as almost all SCP's are tough cookies) and we can't forget the Jekyll and Hyde like girl who goes from super bossy normal persona to super cute stage persona and back again like flipping on a light switch. These girls all come together nicely, and highlight each other well.\\n\\n\r\nIt is claimed by some that the cast is too big. I will concede that it can be cumbersome sometimes, but I think it's not too unmanageable. There are several girls who don't get much in the way of character building, but that's not always a bad thing. There's not really any need to expand on every single girl and tell her entire life story. Move through the primaries, such as the core three, and a few others, and we're good. Its okay to have background girls. Having each one embody a certain trait is enough to flesh out the storyline, such as the meowing cat girl or the nervous young one. \\n\\n\r\nI will drop a smallish SPOILER here. One of the things that baffled me is the vice president of the student council, a mysterious girl named Nozomi. She is presented being a tarot card reader several times, and also appears in traditional miko dress a few times, but the rub is that out of nowhere when it's time to motivate certain characters she suddenly jumps at them and begins groping their breasts. She does this a few different times actually. Its played off as funny, but takes away from her overall mysterious and wise air. END SPOILER.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are lovable, cute to the extreme, and are well enough formed to carry their part of the story well. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nThis series is just a blast to watch, and I got wrapped up in rooting for the girls. When certain obstacles come into their path, some of them were enough for me to lean forward and say 'oh no!' at my screen more than once. If you love music then by all means, check this one out! I'd ranked it 10 here too if only there hadn't been a few small things, such as Nozomi's 'punishment' actions along with the gripe that the opening theme song contains a slight spoiler in who exactly ends up in the group by the end. Other than that, I found myself smiling and nodding my head to the music as they sang and went through the experience of building their group and honing their music and routines to perfection. \\n\\n\r\nLove Live! School Idol Project scored a spot on the wall featuring the core three members. So enjoy the music, and don't worry I won't tell anyone that you were dancing around during the songs! Until next time, my friends!",

            "content": "I was introduced to this anime while playing the smartphone game. I wasn't expecting much from it to be honest but it was much better than what i originally thought.\r\n   The story is all right. It's pretty basic. The 3 students, Honoka, Umi and Kotori  decides to form an idol group to save their school from being closed.  Along the way they find more students joining eventually forming a group of 9 with the name \"Muse\". Along the way, they come over many hardships together and grabbing opportunities to save their school.  But this anime is focusedmore on telling stories of each characters instead of focusing on a well constructed story. In that way, they did a good job. With each episodes, you get to see more character traits of the each members(especially in the second season). Also as you watch, you'll suddenly find your self looting for the group \"Muse\" and sympathizing with them on certain occasions.\\n\\n\r\n   The art is simply outstanding and beautiful.The 2D art is amazing. However, I didn't like the 3D. With 3D,they look emotionless and robotic.Don't worry though. The 3D is only found on the Live shows where  Muse performs a song.I do feel that live could have done entirely on 3D. I would give a 10 for this one but 3D is holding it down. If there's an option, I'm giving 9.5.\\n\\n\r\n   This is a music related anime and I really enjoyed their insert songs to be honest. Quite catchy. Other than that, the opening and ending and the OST is very well done too. The OST is used very efficiently in different situations.Beautifully done on this one.\\n\\n\r\n   All 9 main characters in this anime has round  character traits. You might think at first they are flat but like I said, more interesting traits are discovered throughout the episode.  All 9 characters are very diverse in terms of personality and designs. Well done in terms of characters. The characters are also developed along the way(with this, you might want to continue with the 2nd season) so they are dynamic instead of staying static. \\n\\n\r\n   I really enjoyed watching it to be honest. The live can really ditch the 3D but i do not regret watching the series as a whole!.  Non anime fans wouldn't enjoy this series though. I'll definitely be re watching it again if I have time after watching my to watch list!. Will purchase any DVDs or Blu rays if possible!. It was quite memorable considering that this anime had a very different feel than other animes that I have watched that focuses on action,adventure and suspenseful stories. Enjoyed it verymuch.\\n\\n\\n\r\n  Overall, I'm giving it an 8. Really liked the art, sound and characters. The story was ok and 3D could have been not used(or at least amke them look like a living character) but an enjoyable series as a whole.",

After watching this Season and playing the Game, they seem to not be connected to each other, which is a plus to those who already started on the Game first followed by the Anime.\r\nStory: 8\r\nThe story is entirely focused on saving the school due to low Student applicants. Honoka and her Friends decide to start an Idol Club for their school to hope to attract more students to save the school.\r\nArt: 9\r\nI absolutely find the Art in thisAnime very cute. I also like the fact that CGI is used in the Live Shows. Some many not like the idea of 3D CGI, but it works well in this Anime where all the Characters are dancing. Its like seeing a live concert of dancers on stage dancing and you should see every move with different angles.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nYes, this is a Music genre Anime, so you will expect Music to play. As with any Music based anime, its a bit difficult to Review a song because everybody has different taste in music. If you love J-Pop and Idol music (i don't know the term for it) then you will enjoy the Music here. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nAll the Characters are sweet, cute, and funny girls that you will surely love. As the story progresses, you learn more of the characters and many conflicts they will encounter along the way. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI am a huge fan of these types of Anime and i really enjoyed watching it. From the comedy to the seriousness to the Drama and of course the dancing and singing. Overall, i'll give this Season a 8 out of 10 and i do recommend watching this if you love Music-genre Anime. \\n",

            "content": "A review about a GREAT anime. Recommend reading the whole review.\r\nWhen I first heard about Love Live! School Idol Project, the name got me going. Is it a romance anime or a idol anime (maybe even both). Turns out it's just a idol anime.\r\nStory: 3 \r\nI got into the anime very quickly after the first two episodes. They were what kept me watching, they were definitely not boring and didn't lack of many attributes that keep the audience from getting bored.  Mainly the anime's structure was definitely strong in an interesting way. Love live didn't have an amazing story line as it fell offnear the middle of the anime drastically and went nowhere but somethings kept me from watching it. The idol group (Muse) kept pursuing their dreams and becoming better while recruiting more members to their group. Muse's goal is to become popular, famous and successful, and hopefully one day surpass Arise (idol group) in the ranking ladder. Just that thought in mind was really exiting and i couldn't wait to watch every other episode. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nThe art is not so unique that you can recognize too easily from other anime's. What makes an anime's art work good is when it's original. I just feel like this art-style is being overused. Doesn't go too much into details. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nSound is the strongest part of this anime. Stunning! Obviously, it's an idol anime. But this takes a step further from other idol. When the characters sing, it's so good it gives me the goose bumps! The reason i gave it a 9 was sometimes, the characters sound a little over-exaggerated and doesn't fit all too well with a certain character, but rarely. I really have not much to say other than \"great!\".\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\r\nThe characters are very unique from each other. Giving the anime a lot more space of room to toy with because there are 9 different characters! The main important characters are Honoka, Kotori, and Umi.\\n\r\nThe rest are more of a side character but are each a big contribution to the idol group and the series with each character being important in an episode. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nEnjoyable in two different aspects, comedy and singing. Love live gives me a smile in my face when i'm watching because in each episode there is something funny and not all anime's have that. The Singing is a big factor when reviewing this anime because it is an idol based anime. Each music is great, and they really mean a lot when singing.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 6.4\\n\r\nDidn't read because it was too long?\\n\r\nSummary:\\n\r\n-Story:3.\\n\r\n Had a good start but fell off in the middle of the series. Didn't have a good an original goal. \\n\\n\r\n- Art:7.\\n\r\n Was good but wasn't original. It was good when it transitioned into 3d models when              performing concerts but didn't have too much shading, effects...etc.\\n\\n\r\n-Sound:9.\\n\r\n Obviously an idol anime would put itself in a good position when graded with sound. Really good and i can't get enough of their sound tracks!\\n\\n\r\n-Character:6. \\n\r\nEach character part-took a good role in each episode leaving no characters mysterious and successfully gave each characters a good personality. Lacked of giving character with more time.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:7.\\n\r\nLove live gave one more thing just than an idol singing. Comedy. Each end of an episode would leave me with a good smile and wanting to watch more.",

            "content": "Love Live School Idol Project is a multimedia project. There were a lot of different companies behind this. ASCII Media Works, Lantis, Dengeki G's Magazine and Sunrise. The overall project included games, music, manga, light novels an anime series and an anime film. Today we'll be looking at series one of the anime brought to us by Sunrise in 2013. \r\nStory: \r\nOur heroines happily attend Otonokizaka Academy when they get some bad news. Due to a lack of interest in the school, it's slated to close with their current first years being the last class. The student council President and Vice President, Eri and Nozomi,are determined to find a way to gain interest, but have no idea how to go about it. Meanwhile, second year student Honoka is also trying o think of a way when she happens to pass a very popular school and notices something. One of their big draws is that they have a popular school idol group attending. Honoka decides that the best thing to do would e to form a school idol group for Otonokizaka and gets her best friends, Kotori and Umi to join her in the endeavour.\\n\\n\r\nOn the downside, the anime delves into artificial sources of tension overmuch. What do I mean by that?Well, they'll introduce a character and make a production about whether or not that character is going to join Honoka's idol group, \u03bc's (pronounce Muse). And this is something they do thrice. Well, I saw that character with the group in the opening sequence but maybe that actually isn't going to happen said no one ever. To be fair, this is the first series and it is important to show how these girls all get involved in \u03bc's. The problem is the pomp over whether or not they will. There are a lot of things done well in the series too. The pacing is really good and I like that the girls are allowed to actually fail at a few points. Which does create some genuine tension that actually really works. The story is simple, but it's effectively executed and it ends with a good note.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are pretty archetypical. I will say, to the series' credit, that several of them are allowed to develop and grow over the course of the series. I will also say that, in all fairness, they aren't poorly done archetypes, the execution does work in the context of a series like this. The characters are a lot of fun and there are some really good interactions. My biggest issue is with the character of Nozomi. To be specific, with her tendency to go into bad touch mode. She gropes the other girls without their permission on several occasions. The worst part is that most of them would probably totally allow it if she asked properly.  I don't think Rin would since she only seems to have eyes for Hanayo, but the rest probably would, assuming she asked nicely. Even if they wouldn't, that would still be inexcusable behaviour.\\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\\n\r\nTo the series' credit, the costume and character designs are really well done. It's also really good at doing the lighting and dance numbers during \u03bc's lives. The backgrounds are also nicely detailed. My only real complaint is that this is one of those series where noses don't exist. It may be a stylistic choice, but it's a really head-scratching one. \\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\\n\r\nThe casting in this is really good. Due to the nature of the series, they needed ladies who were good singers and actresses. As such, we have the singer Hori Eriko (stage name Pile), Tokui Sora, Kusuda Aina, Mimori Suzuko, Nanjo Yoshino, Uchida Aya, Nitta Emi, Kubo Yurika, & Iida Riho. Most of whom gravitate more towards singing and don't really have many acting credits. Still, they all do well in their roles. The music and singing are both really good. \\n\\n\r\nHo-yay: \\n\\n\r\nThere's a lot of les-yay in this. It might just be on the level of Yuru Yuri. We've got Honoka with most of the other girls, particularly Umi, Kotori, Eri, & Maki. There's also the dynamic between Rin and Hanayo. Which is incessantly adorable. We've also got Nozomi and Eri, who come across as a couple who have been together for several years. There's also Nozomi in general with her totally uncool bad touch tendencies. Incidentally, she's another shrine maiden yuri girl. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts: \\n\\n\r\nLove Live School Idol Project is an enjoyable series. The story is well done. The characters are mostly good. The music and acting are impeccable and the art is good. If you enjoy musical school anime, give it a go. My final rating for it is going to be a 7/10. In future, I'll look at the second series. But next week is going to be  Divergence Eve.",

But there's just one thing I'd like to say, there is too much difference on the characters or should I say the whole anime when they perform and they do not. I love them when they did not perform, but when they just started dancing and singing, they look like some characters from some 3D game. I'm not saying that the animation is bad when they perform, but the difference is what makes it less interesting for me at least.\r\nI love the story though, its refreshing to watch anime when they work hard for someparticular objective what seems to be impossible for them at first. So, I recommend this anime for people who haven't go through it yet.",

            "content": "I finished watching this anime with a friend on new year's eve, and while she liked it, I was less impressed. Before Christmas I had just finished watching Sword Art Online II and Akame Ga Kill, so after Christmas I was still at a high from those two amazing anime. So maybe it's because I'm comparing it too heavily to other anime, but 'Love Live! School Idol Project' did not impress me very much. \r\nStory - The story was clear and concise. Save the school from closing down by starting a school idol group as a publicity stunt. While it was easy to follow, itwas also easy to predict. The show gave little in surprises or excitement and was just too basic for my liking. But I must commend them for staying on track. A short anime like this has to stay on track, because they don't have time for fillers and side stories. While the story was basic for my liking, I must admit there were times when I enjoyed the simplicity, when I knew what was going to happen, and it happened, it was kind of refreshing and I could sit back and enjoy the show. \\n\\n\r\nArt - The art in this show is beautiful. 'Love Live! School Idol Project' is a slice of life anime, and therefore you can't expect real artistic spectacles like unique settings or amazingly detailed weapons or spaceships. It is standard for this genre; school, arcades, modern towns and students. The show is detailed though, and you don't get any faceless people in the crowd which is nice. The only place this anime really stands out in terms of art is the character design. I am not going to hide it, I thought the girls were stunning! They all had lovely hair and each girl had a different colour which distinguished the members of the group nicely. It was also clear that they were drawn with the purpose of being attractive, that typical pretty school girl look you get in a lot of slice of life anime. I would also like to commend the show's artists and directors for omitting panty shots, this show manages to avoid fanservice and for that I thank them. It really is unnecessary. \\n\\n\r\nSound - There isn't much to say on this. I watched the subbed version, and so the Japanese voices were the same old voices you get in anime. The girls all sounded fairly similar, young and cute and girly with few exceptions. The voice acting was on par, and I have no complaints there. The music was pretty good, not to my taste, but if you like the genre of music, idol music, then you'll probably like this. Personally I preferred the music in shows like Kids On The Slope and K-On! but hey that's just me. The music was catchy and upbeat and so no complaints there either.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - I rated the characters a 5 because I felt they were way too shallow. Love Live! is only a 13 episode anime, so maybe that was the reason, but I felt they could have developed the characters further. I feel like I hardly know them. Not a single character had back story and the only way we got to know them was through their interactions with the other members of the Idol group during the course of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - It was alright. Like I said in my introduction, I wasn't very impressed. I would only recommend this show to people who had expressed to me that they like idols or are really into music anime. But other than that, there's no reason to watch this show. It was a fun ride, with a few laughs here and there and the way the girls smiled throughout most of the anime had me smiling as well. Those damn contagious smiles :D \\n\\n\r\nOverall - I am rating the show a 5 for mediocre. It's nothing special, but also it does do it's job. It's an idol show, and so people who like idols and the music that goes with it probably don't care that the story is generic and the characters are shallow.",

            "content": "I have to admit that when I first started watching this show, I wasn't expecting a whole lot. I decided to give it a try because I had recently gotten hooked on the mobile app, but I figured that it would be little more than a feelgood story about some friends getting together and singing some catchy songs. Nothing groundbreaking, and definitely nothing too serious. Which is probably why I was so impressed by what it ended up being.\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nWhat I appreciated the most about Love Live was that it didn't try to pretend that the girls would be able to get up right awayand become the top school idols in the nation. Rather than using the typical \"Character gets by on sheer luck and natural talent\" plotline, it's made entirely obvious that \u03bc's is starting from the very bottom- The group isn't even fully formed until more than halfway through the series. The initial founding trio is shown multiple times at the beginning of the show running up and down stairs and stretching, just so that they can be in shape enough to perform. The road they take to reach their goals is a long one filled with physical, mental, and emotional hardships, and even if it's obvious to most viewers that everything will ultimately turn out well for them, it's still tear-jerking to watch them in their darker moments- and even more satisfying to watch as they gain their first fans, put on their first live performance, and slowly but steadily watching them grow not just as performers, but as a team.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art style in this anime fits the overall tone perfectly- There are a LOT of bright colors, and the girls' eyes are almost constantly sparkling. The animation is generally pretty beautiful to look at. The normal, everyday scenes are above average, but nothing overly special. But whenever there is a performance by  \u03bc's (this includes the OP theme), the show upgrades its animation to a more 3D-type style in order to more fluidly portray the dancing and expressions. Those bits are absolutely stunning, even if they take a bit of getting used to.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOf course, as an anime centered around a (school) idol group, there are bound to be some catchy songs, and Love Live doesn't disappoint on that front. Of course there's the bright OP song \"Bokura wa Ima no Naka de\" and the upbeat ED \"Kitto Seishun ga Kikoeru,\" but each episode usually has at least one insert song that \u03bc's performs as part of the story. They're all about the same in terms of quality, which is to say that they're all really good. I'm not a big enough fan of the style to listen to them on a regular basis outside of watching the show, but none of them are annoying to listen to, and they're all fitting for the mood of the show- that is to say, incredibly optimistic and, for the most part, upbeat.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nFor the most part, I absolutely loved the characters in Love Live. I have a soft spot for first-year member Hanayo, the soft-spoken girl who is extremely shy until she starts talking about her incredible, lifelong passion for idols (her best friend, the ever-energetic first-year Rin- another favorite of mine- comments that she's an entirely different person when someone brings up idols). The other first-year, Maki, was okay, but she never stood out to me as much more than a standard tsundere. The second year trio- arguably the main characters, seeing as they were the initial founders of \u03bc's- were generally pretty likable as well. Honoka was cheerful through the majority of the series (barring one of the more dramatic episodes toward the end), Umi started off a bit frigid but quickly warmed up into one of the more well-rounded characters, and Kotori was usually pretty happy, but didn't play a very critical role until the end. As for the third years, well... they were probably some of my least favorite characters. Nico was a bit annoying (basically a second tsundere, albeit a much LOUDER tsundere than Maki), Nozomi was just sort of bland, although she did grow on me, and Eri, the student council president who is initially opposed to the very existence of \u03bc's, was undoubtedly my least favorite character in the series. Even after she joined the group and mellowed out a bit (This isn't a spoiler, as the OP shows all nine girls together from the very first episode), I just couldn't find it in me to like her. \\n\\n\r\nBasically, I don't think any of the characters are particularly strong on their own. But I still gave them an 8/10, because I loved the way that they all complemented each other, and they all showed at least a little bit of growth at the end of the series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nBased on the scores I gave this anime, I think it should be fairly obvious that I enjoyed it. The sad scenes are only sad for long enough to make the mood upswing that much more satisfying, and the happy scenes are strong because after a while, it's impossible NOT to feel something for the hardworking characters. It's an emotional roller coaster, and it's so much more satisfying than it seems like it's going to be.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nLike I said at the beginning, I got a whole lot more out of this anime than I ever expected. I would recommend giving it a watch, even if it doesn't look all that special or interesting at first glance- before I watched Love Live, I had absolutely no interest in idol-themed anime. The music bored me, and I expected it to be yet another \"cute girls doing cute things\" slice-of-life show. But it's SO much more than that, and I've found a new favorite anime to add to my list.\\n",

Never mind that it has to do with idols (which isn't my cup of tea), the series overall has one main character but never derails from it's central goal: the group of 9 girls has their heart set on competing (and winning) the Love Live event to boost the popularity of the school so itdoesn't have to close down.  Simple, yet enjoyable journey overall and I'd recommend taking a watch.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, my review is skewed from the aforementioned show, however I felt a lot better with the second season (which I'll write a separate review on).\\n\\n\r\nStory: Cut-and-paste K-ON!  No, really I can't get over this, it really does not feel like an original story.  Even the dreams and goals of the main protagonist are the same (Honoko and Yui), they're both aloof, it's like they also pull all the characters into Muse/HTT in the same manner, and a tragedy hits near the end of the series which has the nail-biting viewer asking what's going to happen next?  There's no real resolution to the series either so again, it doesn't feel like an original or inspired story at all.  It's not boring, but I had hoped for better.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I had a problem with the inconsistency of how the characters are drawn.  When there's any close-up shots, their features are drawn out and colored more (lips, eyes, nails, etc) and become more shoujo-esque.  However, when they appear farther away, it seems more generic art and those facial features are less accentuated.  The animation for the dances are pretty spot on, but during some of the concert sequences, I felt it was very CG-like, as if I was watching Dream Club or Idolm@ster for X-Box 360/PS3.  Call me old fashioned, but I prefer a more hand-drawn feel.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The music is very catchy, but I didn't feel it was very memorable.  By and far, there wasn't a track or performance I didn't enjoy watching, but I didn't feel the urge to run out and buy the soundtrack.  The opening and closing themes are among the better of the music in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: You really can't help but like at least one of the nine girls in this show.  They made sure to make them dynamically different yet have a likeable side.  This becomes more apparent in the second season.  While the series does focus around Honoka primarily and Kotori/Umi, they give a fair amount of time to most of the characters on screen.  The characters is what makes this show so much fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, it's still a fun show to watch, regardless if you feel the need to compare it to other series.  As a story, I felt it was uninspired (yet not boring) but it doesn't really have fillers, over abundance of fan service, nor scenes that are so over the top it would derail from the show.  The music is catchy but not amazing.  Really watch this show because the characters are a lot of fun to watch, especially their chemistry together.",

            "content": "\"Oh it is just another \"idol\" girls anime\"\r\nThat is what I always thought of Love Live! School Idol Project and was always hesitant to watch it when I want to watch something new. After running out of new animes, I've decided to check this one out and I regret not watching this sooner.\r\nStory       :   7/10\r\nThe story is simple and straightforward with a few twists along the way. The main character tries to save her school from being closed down and became a school idol. The idea is not new or unique. However, the thing that makes itinteresting to watch are these few \"twists\" along the way. These twists are what keeps me going to watch and keep me wondering of how and what the characters will do. The ending actually exceeds my expectation. While it isn't totally unpredictable, I find it is a great ending for an anime that I thought was \"some other \"Idol Girls\" anime although it does have a bit of a plothole. Some of the comedy part have burst myself in laughter, while some are just makes you goes \"Awww...\" which is pretty much the same with \"cute girls doing cute things\" but this one shows it in an idol-y way.\\n\\n\r\nThe story could have been better though. Some of the characters weren't highlighted and didn't have background stories as much as others in the story which can be labelled as a \"side character that tags along\". \\n\\n\r\nArt         :    8/10\\n\r\nIf you take consideration of recent animes that have insane graphics, Love Live! wouldn't shine as much. But when you take it from a slice-of-life and \"idol\" anime point of view, the artwork is really good. While some may dislike the artwork because 3D was used in the anime (like I am at first), I find it quite okay after some while. The scenes weren't overused and the quality did not decrease as the series goes on. \\n\\n\r\nSound    :   9/10\\n\r\nProbably the best part of this series are the music. While I usually skipped out the opening and ending of a series, I truly enjoy listening to this one alongside with the music that is included in some of the episodes. The choice of voice actor/actress is great and fits into the characters very well except for one character. I actually find a bit strange when hearing Maki (The girl with the red hair) speaks in the series, It kind of sounded like she was recorded somewhere different than the other VA. I always think of this as some sort of a musical drama which I like from time to time.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter :   8/10\\n\r\nNico-Nico-Nii!\\n\r\nYou are going to hear this phrase a lot and you are going to love it. The characters were unique from one another. From the design and personality, Sunrise portrays the character quite well and is highly distinguishable from which one is which. Most of the character design fits into their personality. It really entertains me when I know more about the characters in the series. It is really entertaining when the characters are shown to like or dislike something which is shown in the series.\\n\r\nWith that being said, the characters aspect could've been better. I find the character development isn't really there, only a few characters that change in the series and some characters did not have a background like I mentioned. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment :  8/10\\n\r\nLike I said before, I treat this as some sort of a musical drama. Songs shows up where they shouldn't be and those songs are actually a part of the story which is good in its own way. I truly enjoy watching Honoka (The main character) and her friends doing cute things (obviously) and probably would re-watch it some day. The main reason to watch the series would be because of \"Nico-Nico-Nii!\".\\n\\n\r\nOverall     :   8/10\\n\r\nLove Live! School Idol Project has flaws. It may be not the perfect \"girls idol\" anime out there, but I truly enjoy watching it. Treat of it as a musical drama and you will enjoy as much as I am.",

            "content": "My time with Love Live! is much like the few members of its nine strong cast who were reluctant about being school idols. I wonder how a pushy, narrow sighted girl managed to rope me into this crazy gig, and then I wonder if this idiot turned friend will drag me to another adventure that was more fun than I ever thought possible. The nine strong cast is \u03bc's (pronounced \u2018Muse\u2019), named for the Nine Goddesses of Music. Gods don\u2019t die, and neither can my love for their antics, their struggles, and their story.\r\nBut Umi Sonoda would suggest I explain everything before acting sentimental, andI wouldn\u2019t expect less from little miss \u2018modesty and logic will hopefully win the day (or at least try to guide it).\u2019 She\u2019s the kind of person who tries to keep others on track, sometimes a bit too much when her friends would rather relax at the beach. Thankfully, her sense of discipline is never misguided, as she\u2019ll often pick up her friends after they fall from a mistake. She doesn\u2019t move past being the voice of reason, but she is a major reason \u03bc's goes far.\\n\\n\r\n\u03bc's itself is lead by Honoka Kousaka, whose motive for being a school idol is as crazy as it sounds. Her school is close to closing down due to the lack of new students, and the juniors before her will be the last new students the school accepts. After a chance glimpse at how a concert from a school idol group has brought attention to their school, she has the idea of being a school idol to hopefully attract new students to her school. Enough students to the point where her school won\u2019t close down. Surely such an impulsive idea won\u2019t be where the story takes off from, right?\\n\\n\r\nWell, the story starts there but it doesn\u2019t take off until three episodes into the first season. Reality hits Honoka as her first concert fails, and from that point on the story really begins. Much of season one is about our lively lyrical leader bringing other students to her cause. Despite this, the story doesn\u2019t get serious but doesn\u2019t lack for purpose either. One of the main strengths of Love Live! is an unbridled sense of fun that never loses sight of its story. There\u2019s enough stage practice to make the lead up into every concert believable, but even the antics outside that are always meaningful.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the change into crazy costumes to reinvent their image for fear of growing stale, to the beach episode that brings Maki Nishikino out of her shell in more ways than one, to the odd responsibility shared by Honoka, Umi, and Kotori Minami in season two, every moment is more than its humor. Despite the fun, there are still times when the story gets serious, and it\u2019s almost never unfounded as even things mentioned in passing come to show their importance later on.\\n\\n\r\nIt especially shows with Kotori, whose story deals with the issue of what it means to contribute to a team through humorous bouts of \u2018writer\u2019s block.\u2019 Kotori herself hasn\u2019t a single aggressive bone in her body, but that doesn\u2019t mean a sweet and cheerful persona is all she is. She has her doubts and worries, and her reticence at one point truly tests the friendship between herself, Umi, and Honoka. Her story implies the question of what it means to chase a dream, and whether the chase can make someone lose sight of what\u2019s around them.\\n\\n\r\nAnd for third year student Nico Yazawa, being a part of \u03bc's is another chance to chase her dream. There\u2019s a good, if prideful, reason she wants to become a school idol, and her over the top \u2018cute\u2019 persona shows that dedication. In truth, she\u2019s very smug and cynical, but not without good reason. In every jaded person is an optimist waiting to let loose, and Nico does quite enjoy herself as the series goes on, however smug she still acts. Her vast array of idol stuff like concert DVDs also shows her dedication to the art, even before going into her backstory. Much to the pleasure of first year student Hanayo Koizumi.\\n\\n\r\nHanayo is the old case of how passion can call out an entirely different side to someone. At a glance, she\u2019s timid, and her joining \u03bc's is partly thanks to a small push from her friend Rin Hoshizora and classmate Maki. But from that point on, she\u2019s often energetic, especially in the presence of idols and being an idol fan herself, and of course during \u03bc's concerts. There\u2019s a kernel of truth to how her interests and hobbies suddenly bring out such an involved side to her, but it isn\u2019t over the top to the point of unbelievable.\\n\\n\r\nThen again, the only unbelievable\u2014and weak link by extension\u2014part of the story is Rin. She\u2019s mostly \u2018just there\u2019 in season one, while season two messily develops her with an issue that\u2019s never brought up or hinted at save for early in season one. Her time in the spotlight involves being the temporary leader of \u03bc's for\u2026some reason, and wearing an outfit that\u2019s not her style just because. Though still a quite likable tomboy with a penchant for cat speak, the brief change to that other side of her is largely unfounded to the point where likability is all she has going for her.\\n\\n\r\nCompare this to Maki, who doesn\u2019t lack for believability and likability. Despite being as young as Hanayo and Rin, she carries herself with a senior like demeanor to speak level even with third years Eli Ayase and Nozomi Tojo. At the same time, her true self often shows whether she\u2019s flustered or just being a little more open around Nico and Nozomi, and everyone else. And yet, her want to hide her feelings is less about any one of her friends and more about being truly reticent despite her apparent sharpness. Maki is well developed, and not just for her body as Nozomi learns firsthand(s).\\n\\n\r\nFor the curious, the big chested Nozomi has a small running joke throughout the series where she gropes the girls of \u03bc's. Nozomi herself is often in the background, but due to her role and reason for being in \u03bc's, it makes sense. Her role is someone who watches over these girls (especially Eli), her reason more than just wanting to watch over them as she befriends them. Mischievous and motherly, Nozomi looks after \u03bc's as if it was her own creation, and the creation of her own person isn\u2019t lacking despite (or maybe even because of?) her lack of screentime.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, her friend Eli isn\u2019t open to \u03bc's being a thing at all. Not at first. Her doubt towards them is rooted in her past success, and doesn\u2019t think they\u2019ll do anything for the school\u2019s future. She has an interesting parallel with Honoka for much of season one, in that despite thinking differently about school idols, they both want to save the school. As student council president, though, Eli works behind the scenes as \u03bc's grows in numbers, ever tempted to let it go and just have fun with them. Her struggle between her duty and desire, despite her pedigree, makes her nothing short of compelling.\\n\\n\r\nBut even as Eli becomes a kind of second leader in season two, it\u2019s still Honoka at the heart of \u03bc's. Honoka herself is emotion personified, the sheer range of her facial expressions communicating what dialog can\u2019t. A melancholic gaze, a smile that triumphs over her tears, a crossed scowl, an indifferent but thoughtful gaze, an infectiously energetic smile, and many more faces all serve to perfectly round out her persona. That doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s without her faults, as she can be focused to the point of losing sight of what\u2019s around her, something that comes up toward the end of season one and the start of season two.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s during the second season that Honoka tries to stay aware of what\u2019s around her, partly due to a personal incident in season one, partly from an extra duty as student council president in season two. Yeah. I don\u2019t know how she became student council president either. The best guess among viewers is, after the school was saved, nobody was better fit to be student council president than the school\u2019s savior. Yeah. I don\u2019t know how rallying school idols translates to running a kind of government either.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, Honoka eventually, if reluctantly, grows into the role of student council president, and never misses a step as part of \u03bc's as they look to compete at the Love Live! event. During season one, they learned about the Love Live! being a chance for school idols to really show off what they can do. Unfortunately, they had to drop out at the last minute, but they got enough attention anyway to the point where the school was saved. So why would \u03bc's still want to compete at the next Love Live! event?\\n\\n\r\nTo which I answer: why must there be a deeper reason to want to do something? Does it matter if passion starts from duty? If they\u2019ve made it this far, why let that effort go to waste? With the introduction of its nine strong cast being largely finished in season one, season two changes the focus from \u2018Honoka and the rest of \u03bc's\u2019 to \u2018here is \u03bc's as a group of equals.\u2019 Not just Honoka, but all of \u03bc's wants to compete in and win the Love Live! event. Their time in the spotlight much more even, each girl no less passionate than the next. But with their sights set on Love Live!, rival school idol group A-Rise has their sights set on them.\\n\\n\r\nIn many ways, A-Rise is the antithesis to \u03bc's. The latter starts as a group of three with Honoka, Umi, and Kotori, and blossoms into nine great performers, while the former is only the trio of Tsubasa Kira, Erena Todo, and Anju Yuki. For how alike these six look respectively, they still take on their own identities, \u03bc's donning frills and youthful vigor while A-Rise sports sleek smooth sensuality in their wardrobe and dance moves. In a refreshing change of pace, though, A-Rise isn\u2019t a conniving group trying to sabotage the main cast. They simply want to win the Love Live!, and truly look forward to facing \u03bc's. There\u2019s mutual respect between both groups.\\n\\n\r\nBut as \u03bc's gets closer to the big event, the story becomes less about the actual competition and more about the looming finale they can\u2019t avoid. This plays perfectly into why Nozomi is part of \u03bc's, as the story of nine comes full circle before she, Eli, and Nico are to graduate after the Love Live! event. The thought weighs on their minds, but the show must go on and they rightfully cherish every moment together. Every misadventure, every squabble, every concert teaches them to accept the bitter with the sweet.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the concerts during season one are mostly nothing sweet to look at. It often looks like a smile plastered on a dancing doll. Thankfully, season two greatly improves the animation during these scenes, blending the 2D and 3D work into a cohesive showcase. The coloring and design makes for vivid variation. Even the darker colors of A-Rise shine brightly, and the thematic unity across costumes still have subtle differences to reflect each person, such as Anju being A-Rise\u2019s only wearer of frills, or Umi\u2019s outfit in one concert rocking shorts instead of a skirt.\\n\\n\r\nSo the show looks great, but it also knows HOW to look great. The series knows its girls are the cover attraction to itself, but thankfully it doesn\u2019t overplay its hand. It forgoes sexualizing its cast for an emotional connection through personality and appearance. It\u2019s flattery that induces a star struck state, without objectifying the cast in any negative fashion. Even the swimsuit episode is fairly harmless, while Nozomi\u2019s groping antics miraculously avoid falling into the suggestive moans that are prone to happen in other shows. Early concert scenes aside, I see no reason to call the visuals nothing short of excellent.\\n\\n\r\nNow, no amount of outstanding outfits or lovely lighting will do anything without music. And indeed, Love Live!\u2019s soundtrack is far and away its strongest aesthetic element. There\u2019s music for every occasion, from the quick tempo of a chase scene, to an over the top piece for a joke, to the slow piano keys for matching melancholy, and even the revitalizing recap music at the start of each of episode, all compliment the mood to great effect. And the few moments where music is absent are well chosen, and stand out that much more for it.\\n\\n\r\nBut while the instrumentals are good, the real reason Love Live! is a musical treat are the actual songs, which it never lacks. \u2018Private Wars\u2019 and \u2018Shocking Party\u2019 play hard, fast, and clean, capturing the aura of coolness about A-Rise. \u2018Advance Tomorrow\u2019 reflects the spirit of the show, being loud and fun but starting from genuinely heartfelt intentions through a soprano style voice. And of course, the two opening numbers, \u2018We\u2019re All In This Moment\u2019 and \u2018That Is Our Miracle\u2019 carry lyrical significance with what happens in the story. This isn\u2019t music that\u2019s just a joy to listen to, but pieces that say something more when listening closely.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the two songs this is most exemplified in is \u2018Start;Dash.\u2019 Unlike much of \u03bc's other songs, it starts with an almost melancholic feeling, starts singing in a defiant fashion, and ends in a manner that says \u2018we\u2019re down, but not out.\u2019 It\u2019s the piece Honoka, Umi, and Kotori sing at their first concert, and the piece \u03bc's sings at the end of season one. The other song is the unforgettable \u2018Snow Halation,\u2019 testifying to the heights people can reach as they work together and understand one another\u2019s feelings; words do no justice to the power of this track.\\n\\n\r\nThere are still more songs than these, from \u2018No Brand Girls,\u2019 to \u2018Our LIVE, Our LIFE with you,\u2019 to \u2018Wonder Zone,\u2019 to \u2018The Door To Our Dreams\u2019; the sheer number of great songs, well done instrumentals, and amount of story significance on each piece, makes the soundtrack of Love Live! nothing but a musical masterpiece. And yes, I\u2019m only counting the music the show itself had, tempted as I am to talk about \u2018Love Marginal\u2019 among others.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I DO want to talk about, is how hard it is for me to discuss Love Live! in any critical manner. It\u2019s a series that caught me completely off guard when I was just looking for something to pass the time. It\u2019s a show that makes me wonder just how much aesthetics matter to the viewing experience. It\u2019s a story that forces me to see that even the simplest looking things can be more than meets the eye. And it\u2019s a tale of gung ho dream chasing that\u2019s infectiously optimistic.\\n\\n\r\nNow, some people will surely have problems with the ending, and it\u2019s usually not the kind of finale I go for either. Then again, every rule has exceptions. For those people who\u2019ve already seen both seasons of Love Live!, let me say that I can overlook season two\u2019s ending because I\u2019m not expecting another adventure.\\n\\n\r\nI just want an encore.",

            "content": "Just as much as we need a gateway anime to hook us up into this little world of colorful fights and beautiful blood rain, there comes a time when we have to watch something to remind us why we still like these things. And even if a series like Love Live, whose selling point isn't gore or a super addictive plot, isn't what we expected to end up watching when we started (I think my teenage me would frown If I told him I saw an anime about a bunch of cute girls singing in a stage), I think it has a lot of qualitiesthat we don't usually find in anime in general. The problem is that its cover fits a profile that most people (myself included) would deem stupid, either for prejudice or for having actual experience with a show that looks similar to this one. But even though it shares some of the questionable tendencies of other series from a similar ilk (the so called \"moe\" genre), one needs to call out the fact that this one actually manages to avoid crippling itself with its own clich\u00e9s and tropes.\\n\\n\r\nCute girls, sure. But is it as meaningless as the others? We'll see.\\n\\n\r\n-Story:\\n\r\nThe story is what you read in the synopsis. There'll be tropes and conventions you've seen before, even clich\u00e9s sometimes, but it actually tells something. It progresses. It doesn't get stuck in: \"Yo, gurl, it's so fun being in a club! All we do is sit an' talk shit, and be cute. No need to practice or deal with life issues. Sure being a teenage girl is a-ma-zing.\"\\n\\n\r\nThe thing's not written to make you go: \"what a badass plot twist\", but it takes itself seriously enough to follow a logical path to get things done, and there's the feeling that they're actually starting things from scratch and fighting for them, instead of, you know, succes brought forth by magic. This is actually surprising, at least to me, because when I see a title like this the only thing that crosses my mind is \"K-On! again\", which, for acknowledged people, means that the series will \"preserve the flow of everyday life forever\", or, in more common terms, focus in unbelievably trivial daily stuff and no character progression. It's hard to tell wheter that situation will suit a specific series or not, but the case being that this format can cause from idle entertainment to hellish boredom, seeing an idol show about idols actually doing idol stuff is refreshing. And when it's handled in a way where it gets its points across: laughter when you have to laugh and emotion when it needs emotion, then there's no way you can deny its quality.\\n\\n\r\nBut if all in all you still can't find the story compelling (or you just like to nitpick a lot, like me), at least the humor should make up for it.\\n\\n\r\n-Characters:\\n\r\nIn a genre where airhead MCs are the norm (and usually its curse), I believe this is the first time I can say: she's actually useful! Honoka might still be an airhead, but out of all the characters of the show, she does suit the role of the engine that moves the whole team, and she does it perfectly. She even gets proper character development, something that would seem otrageous in many shows like this.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast isn't bad either. It is true that is full of archetypes we've already seen a zillion times, but the writers manage to put a fresh feeling into them, and exploit their inherent qualities. You can complain that compared to other kinds of shows they're really not that fleshed out, but I find it hard to name many shows of this type that actually do this. The only bad thing is that some characters lose the spotlight as the show progresses (and thus become easy to forget), but it at least makes them likeable enough to not get annoyed at their presence.\\n\\n\r\n-Art:\\n\r\nI wouldn't call it great (just cute faces everywhere), but it's very good. I'm not sure if there's a difference between the TV version and the DVDs, but from what I watched the animation is pretty solid, and the character expressions don't suddenly turn into eldritch abominations for a lack of budget. There's also CGI to help smooth things out when they dance and need a more 3D approach to their movements, and it looks good enough. Overall, I think the best animated parts are the ones when they're dancing, which is a HUGE plus considering this is an idol anime.\\n\\n\r\n-Sound:\\n\r\nOpening, ending and insert songs are all pop (which means that if you like pop, you'll probably like them as well). This isn't a surprise considering what the series is about, but the actual OST of the show is also very fitting and highlights the moments in a timely manner. There's even some fantastic piano in some parts, which I couldn't help to like. The seiyuus also do a great job at portraying their characters, all with their incredibly high-pitched voices and token tsunderism in some of them.\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment:\\n\r\nThis is odd. After watching things like K-On! and other series of a similar ilk, seeing a DVD cover featuring a bunch of cute girls would usually cause me to go \"nope, don't want it\", not because I didn't like the previous ones (which I probably did), but because I've found myself unable to like more. It might come with age, but these kind of shows, whether they're comedies, club-based stories, or the most ridiculously simple slice of life, become more and more tedious to watch as you get by, and finding something that you can even praise for its actual effort in improving the genre's quality is quite the thing. Personally, I loved it. It was really fun, and all that \"cuteness\" crap was finally subordinated to the freaking plot.\\n\\n\r\nSo, would I recommend it?\\n\\n\r\nTotally.\\n\\n\r\nHave fun!",

            "content": "This is my first review, so please bear with me.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThe story is easy to understand. School closing down due to a lack of applicants, and three girls decide to form a school idol group to gain popularity. They name this idol group \"\u03bc's\" and eventually end up with nine members in total. I had no problems with pacing of the story - it wasn't too slow or fast - and found each episode very interesting, making me want to watch more.\r\nArt: 8/10\r\nThe art is, in a word, flawless. The characters, although looking very different from one another, are all cute. In fact, I wasonce asked \"Who do you think is the prettiest member of \u03bc's?\". I couldn't choose. They were all beautiful in their own special ways. The one thing I wasn't a fan of was the CG used when songs were performed, but I got used to it later on.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nBecause this is an idol anime, there'll have to be lots of music, right? The songs in this anime were amazing, especially the opening, \"Bokura wa Ima no Naka de\". Normally, I would skip openings, but I didn't skip this one. Not once. The other songs were amazing too, my personal favourite being \"START: DASH\". The songs are catchy and upbeat; it's next to impossible to dislike them.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nThere are nine members of \u03bc's. Each of them had their own personality - and they were all lovable personalities.\\n\\n\r\nHonoka Kousaka: The protagonist. The one who decided to start \u03bc's. An optimistic person who isn't scared to take risks, and her determination is what makes her lovable. Seriously, though. When she was happy, I was happy. When she was upset, I was upset. She made a perfect main character.\\n\\n\r\nEli Ayase: The Student Council president who seems a little antagonistic at first, but as you watch more, you find out that she has her own reasons for seeming like this. She, at first, was against Honoka's idea of creating an idol group, but later on became the 8th member of \u03bc's.\\n\\n\r\nKotori Minami: Honoka and Umi's childhood friend. She is very caring, and has a hard time expressing her feelings because she is thinking about others as well. It took me a while to like her, because I found her weak at first, but I started liking her more after realising how kind she is, because she takes other people's feelings into consideration.\\n\\n\r\nUmi Sonoda: Honoka and Kotori's childhood friend and \u03bc's lyricist. A shy girl who is always thinking logically. She is extremely modest, and isn't a fan of short skirts, but gets used to them later on. She also has a strong will. She is my personal favourite because I adore both her shyness and her strong will.\\n\\n\r\nRin Hoshizora: An energetic tomboy who is a little self-conscious when it comes to wearing skirts, as she was made fun of for wearing them as a child. Rin is, in a word, adorable. Like Honoka, she is always looking at the bright side of things. She can be a little idiotic at times, but she is still lovable. How can anyone hate her?\\n\\n\r\nMaki Nishikino: A tsundere who is \u03bc's composer. I normally dislike tsunderes, but not Maki. Maki is a little stubborn, but also finds it hard to admit her true feelings. She's talented at playing the piano, and is also described as being beautiful. I am someone who usually hates tsunderes, but Maki was different to all the other tsunderes I've ever seen in anime.\\n\\n\r\nNozomi Toujou: Nozomi is the Student Council Vice-President and Eli's best friend, although her personality is very different to Eli's. She helped \u03bc's, even when she wasn't a member of the group. She's kind and wise, which is one of the reasons why I love her as a character. \\n\\n\r\nHanayo Koizumi: Rin's childhood friend who had a passion for idols for a long time. However, being very shy and reserved, it took her a while to gather up the courage to join the group. Hanayo is one of the cutest members of \u03bc's in my opinion. Her two personalities - her shy one and her \"ohmygodIloveidolssomuch\" one - are both very lovable.\\n\\n\r\nNico Yazawa: Like Hanayo, Nico has a passion for idols. She is also a bit stubborn like Maki, but she is also very caring. I honestly don't see how this character can be disliked. She is definitely one of my favourites.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime a lot. The characters were all unique and special, the art was beautiful, and the songs and story were just fabulous.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nI can easily say that this is one of the best anime I have ever watched. Seriously, the worst thing about the anime was probably the CG - and they weren't even that bad! This anime is a must watch.",

            "content": "Now, I've never written a review here on MAL before, and I feel as if I should start with a series that I hold close to my heart: Love Live.\r\nTo give some background apart from what's listed above, Love Live is adapted from a project by Dengeki G's magazine in which they created a 2D idol franchise, often asking for fan input on group names and the like. Before the anime was released, there were many CG music videos for the main group (\u03bc's, pronounced Muse).\r\nSo, yes, there is liberal usage of CG in this show. For the most part, episodes are animated traditionally, butin both the opening animation and any in-show performances, CG is mixed in for dance performances. If you've seen Aikatsu, it's quite a bit like that. It is, admittedly, pretty terrible; but if that's not a deal-breaker, then I would certainly recommend you give the show a try.\\n\\n\r\nYou might be wondering why I described the series as being close to my heart, when the story is generic and sometimes has overwrought drama. Now, the art is cute and well-designed, and the music is, at least in my opinion, some of the better idol-styled music I know, but neither of those is what made me stay with the series.\\n\\n\r\nIt was the characters.\\n\\n\r\nAt first glance, these characters are simply anime girl archetypes, and I won't deny that they're that too. But they're also so much more. Although there are nine of them and only thirteen episodes to fit them into, throughout the series, we get to know them to the point where, honestly, I felt as if they were my friends. While many shows have little but tired tropes in the way of characterization, the girls of Love Live are humanized, with various facets of their personalities explored and little details and quirks to flesh them out.\\n\\n\r\nMy only complaint is that I was so attached to these girls by the end that I wanted to see more of them; but in that case there's a near-endless supply of side material to sate my appetite for \u03bc's.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, it will probably be more enjoyable if you like idols already, but the characters are worth watching the show for on their own.",

            "content": "STORY - 8\r\nART - 8\r\nSOUND - 10\r\nCHARACTER - 8\r\nENJOYMENT - 9\r\nThey're an icon. The symbol of friendship, hope, love, passion, and music admired by those who have seen them. They will show you that enthusiasm and dedication do pay off. They're \u00b5's (\"Muse\"), an ensemble of nine harmonious members. And they're the idol stars of School Idol Project!\r\nI'll preface by saying that I first dived into the Love Live! franchise just looking to enjoy some catchy songs and CGDCT. Which I did get. All of those are right here in this show. But there's also something else\u2014a special quality that draws a motivational and inspirationalangle on what seems to only be a cute entertainment at first glance. It draws me in because it's not easy to find, but once it's realized, we will shoot for the stars.\\n\\n\r\nIt is called passion.\\n\\n\r\nFor the energetic Honoka, her passion is sparked when her beloved school is in risk of closing down upon a decreasing number of yearly enrollments. To form a school idol group; that is her answer. It's ambitious. It's difficult. It's almost like a fantasy. But she and eight other members will soon find that \u00b5's is their passion. And they will head off on a journey to make people smile, to have fun, and to enjoy being together with those who share the same love as you. Embellished by a rich optimism in a world of musical superstars, this is what School Idol Project is all about.\\n\\n\r\nWhat brings the best enjoyment out of this show definitely lies in the large cast of cute characters. The story plays it straight with no deep complexities, so it allows us to focus solely on the girls. They're the gears that unify a charming and lovable group. An additive effect. Group antics are entertaining to watch and \u00b5's is basically an adorable embodiment of fun friendship. But not all are just happy moments.\\n\\n\r\nAt first, a lot of the members have their own hindering circumstances before they join \u00b5's and the group does face large obstacles along the way. While the resolution is cheesy at times, the roots come back to the one main thing that holds this show together. Their passion. No matter how difficult the obstacles are, no matter the results\u2014success or failure\u2014they will continue to practice hard and dedicate themselves to their dream with smiles on their faces. Even when things seem to change for the worst, their shared passion and love put them back on the correct path. To be passionate about something will always come with reasons. For them, it's not just to save their school. It's also to go up there onto the stage and to perform the best as they can, for themselves and for others. Because in their hearts, they know that this is what they all wanted to continue doing: To be the best school idols out there.\\n\\n\r\nSo, when they stand up on the stage to perform a wide variety of spirited songs, you can see their hard work paying off. The mix between 2D and 3D animation might take some time to get used to, but soon enough, it'll become familiar and you can enjoy the dancing choreographs among the colorfully bright atmosphere. Gleaming eyes, enchanting smiles, adorable clothes, and energetic movements. Their emotions sync together with the gorgeous notes from their voices and altogether, all of these features turn their live performance into a stage that's truly fun to experience.\\n\\n\r\nEven when they're done performing, living casually as high school girls, it doesn't stop them from sparkling up with vibrancy. Both the evocative art and the buoyant soundtracks help to give many endearing qualities to \u00b5's. They know how to make me laugh and to make me enjoy their overall enthusiasm. It's simply wonderful. I also have to mention that I lost count on how many times I wanted to say \"So kawaii~\" at them. Just so you know they're not only passionate, they're also too sweet for my heart to take.\\n\\n\r\nSchool Idol Project really went beyond what I've expected from an idol anime. My interest for the appealing songs and the girls transformed into an admiration of their passion, perseverance, and power to pursue their goal through and through. The Love Live! franchise has created \u00b5's, the face of tuneful entertainment, so give it a chance to be their audience. Maybe you'll resonate with them as much as I did.",

            "content": "Objectively speaking, I believe that this anime should be rated a 9. Love Live is one of multiple anime that focus on creating a group of some sort and try to win a competition or strive to be the best ____ group they can be. However, I set Love Live apart because of how the story was written.\r\nOne huge factor I look at is story; mainly because it is the foundation for the anime or manga. Symbolism, format, surprise factor... They all play into a show's 'impact' on their audience and often come off as good storytelling strategies. Love Live possesses these qualities and doestheir best effort to create meaning behind each scene in the anime. On top of that, the anime often subtly hints about future events and throws twists into the mix. \\n\\n\r\nStarting from nothing and turning it into something big is used fairly often in anime, but Love Live is unique among the others. Here we have nine high school girls who come together and form a group in order to save their school from closing. It would be quick to assume that there's nothing more to it than this, right? Honestly, the story really isn't about the group winning or losing, but rather the problems that A-RISE in their path or small moments of growth or breakthroughs. Typically, most anime tend to leave huge cliffhangers for their viewers and, while Love Live does have it's fair share of cliffhangers, most cases these cliffhangers don't mean much in terms of the overall story. They use them to keep viewers wanting more, but don't abuse the power of a cliffhanger.\\n\\n\r\nCould it have been better? Maybe. But imo, a 10 doesn't mean the anime is perfect or even close to perfect. It means that the anime somehow moved the person and didn't have any major flaws (a.k.a. plot holes). As far as I can see from repeatedly watching it, I haven't found any of the sort. Overall, the story created a strong foundation and edged my rating from a 9 to a 10. As for the art, music, and enjoyment factors... They speak for themselves. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, the characters and their personalities are the cherry on top of it all. Their varying personalities give pretty much everyone a character they relate to. The decisions and actions each character makes are completely justified under each circumstance that they encounter. And after completing the series multiple times, the aura each of them presents makes them very memorable characters. Overall, I definitely think this anime deserves a 10 out of 10.",

            "content": "Woah, Love Live? What am I doing in an Idol anime? \r\nWell, I was just curious about why do these kind of 'Idol anime' is very popular in Japan. And I think now I know why.\r\nStory: (10)\r\nThe Story is about Kousaka Honoka, a 2nd year student of Otonokizaka Academy, which is about to close down by the end of the First Year's graduation. So, our MC here is trying to figure out how to stop the closure of the School, and by what? By being an Idol of course. \r\nI'm not a big fan of 'Music' anime, but this one is AWESOME. Not by theSongs, no... it's the story and the lovable character that keep me hooked until the 2nd Season of this show. \\n\\n\r\nArt: (9)\\n\r\nWho cares about Art, really. Except if it's like Mars of Destruction (shivers). The characters are hand-drawn like any other anime, but when they hit the dance floor, they turned into CG. \\n\\n\r\nThat's probably one reason why I give the art 9, the CG. It's not smooth, if it's smoother, it would be an eye-candy. (I think.)\\n\\n\r\nSound: (10)\\n\r\nI like the songs in this anime. My favorite, Is the OP: \"Bokura wa ima no naka de\". Others are also good, like \"Snow Halation\" or \"START: DASH!!\"\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: (9)\\n\r\nHonoka, Umi, Kotori, Hanayo, Rin, Maki, Nico, Nozomi, and Eri. Those are the Nine main characters of this anime, yes NINE. \\n\\n\r\nLoveable? Check. Cute? Check. Tsundere? Check. Carefree? Check. Shy? Check. All the members of Muse will make your heart melt.\\n\\n\r\nCould've been better if there's at least one male character, though.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (9)\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoy this series, it kept me hooked until the 2nd Season. If you're into Idol, this is for you. Comedy? Also for you. Slice of Life? Here you go. \\n",

            "content": "I didn't hate this show, however, I wasn't completely taken by it. I'm super into musical, high school anime, but this wasn't A+ amazing for me. I enjoyed almost every minute of it, and all of the songs were nice, but I found myself being able to predict everything and there wasn't a lot of climax to it. \r\n     I did watch K-On a while before this one and found a lot of similarities. I may have thought that is was repetitive of K-On, a show that I really enjoyed. The characters are similar, the plot is similar, and even theart is similar! A little too much for me though. Don't get me wrong, I appreciated this show and all of it's character developments and little symbolisms. Sometimes, it got a bit too raunchy for me. \\n\\n\r\n   The story around this show is nothing special. A couple of girls form an idol group because their school is going to close if they don't get more students. However, it did evolve a little bit. You could definitely see that the characters were shy and timid at first but then openly change because they each start to feel more comfortable around each other. It's a cute little friendship type thing.\\n\\n\r\n   When I first started watching this I thought the art was super cute, but as it went on, it just wasn't anything special anymore. I did like the designs of their outfits though.\\n\\n\r\n    It's not that I didn't like this show, I really did! But it wasn't one of those shows where I felt something, or learned something from it. I wasn't expecting any of that, but it would have been nice. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10",

            "content": "Love Live is basically about a school, Otonokizaka high that is going to be closed down due to the lack of student enrollment, but eventually the idea of one 2nd year high school girl saves the school from its demise. The idol group starts off with only the main trio(Honoka, Umi, Kotori) but soon grows with more members joining. Love Live attempts its own set of emotional moments, unfortunately, from time to time it can get pretty predictable.\r\nIn terms of characters: I was indifferent for almost all of the characters but two. Originally, I was slightly infatuated with Umi Sonoda, I found her to beadorable sometimes. Later, after Nico's appearance in the anime, I guess you can say that I found...Waifu at first sight? LOL. I have a fascination towards Nico, despite her being irritating sometimes. Not to mention she tends to show her ugly side, a lot. But she is cute, I'd say.\\n\\n\r\nLove Live's overall animation quality is decent, but there is one flaw I would like to bring up. Love Live! has lots of random 3D animation moments thrown in during \u03bc's performance(including the Opening theme). These constant, random 3D sequences can get aggravating and its quite unbearable to watch. Some people might dig the 3D animation, but I don't. This is only my personal opinion, so you'll have to see them and judge for yourself.\\n\\n\r\nIn an anime that focuses towards music, soundtrack is a crucial aspect. Undoubtedly, it is also where Love Live! truly shines. If you've already done your research about Love Live's songs, they released many mini albums of truly satisfying songs(some songs were even released before the TV anime initial airing, I believe), however only some of them are presented in the anime. A few of my favorite songs are \"Bokura wa Ima no Naka de\" and \"No Brand Girls\" in the anime and many other songs such as \"Soldier Game\" and \"Arifureta Kanashimi no Hate\" which aren't presented in the anime. Honestly, J-Pop songs aren't my cup of tea these days, however Love Live's songs are an exception. Opening theme was very pleasing to listen to, but the awkward 3D transitions made it cringing to watch. Lastly, Kotori's voice sounds rather high-pitched and childlike, her voice sounds weird to me.\\n\\n\r\nTo summarize everything, Love Live isn't bad, or close to being top-tier. Despite having its predictable moments, nevertheless it's still a solid slice of life anime which is fun and relaxing to watch. J-pop song fans would be very satisfied with the variety of songs it has. But the art is a mixed bag; Love Live's general animation was alright, but the awkward 3D animations are quite painful to watch,  And the only character I was deeply interested in was Nico Yazawa.\\n\\n\r\nNico is the best. Let me say that again. NICO IS THE BEST. That is all.\\n",

            "content": "Love Live! is a Comedy, Idol anime co-created by music label Lantis and animation studio Sunrise in 2010. The story is about Honoka K\u014dsaka, girl who loves her school and after she hears that it plans to close down because of lack of first year applications, she becomes determined to save her school. After see how popular school idols are, decides to create a idol group called \u03bc's (Muse) with her friends to attract new students and save the school. So that the plot of Love Live, as i normal don't write spoilers, all i can say that the writing and flow of the storyis very well done as every episode is interesting and funny. \\n\r\nNow on the characters, there is nine girls that make up the idol group \u03bc, so i only going to be brief about them.\\n\r\nHonoka K\u014dsaka (Voiced by Emi Nitta), is the main character and leader of \u03bc's, her family owns a sweet shop. She is very cheerful and never gives up on anything,\\n\r\nEli Ayase (Voiced by Yoshino Nanj\u014d), is the student council president who is also trying to save the school. She doesn't like school idols, but joins \u03bc's when she sees how hard they are trying to save the school.\\n\r\nKotori Minami (Voiced by Aya Uchida), is a childhood friend of Honoka and the daughter of the school's Chairwoman. She normally have her head in the clouds but she is kind hearted. She is \u03bc's wardrobe designer and one of it's choreographers.\\n\r\nUmi Sonoda (Voiced by Suzuko Mimori), is a childhood friend of Honoka and Kotori, and a member of the school' Kyudo (Japanese martial art of archery) club.

The art style is well designed with attention to detail with it's character design. The animation is beautiful created especially the song scenes which as been designed in a different animation style to make it look more better. the character animations and facial expressions are well made and look very believable. The voice acting is great and singing is well done as seems that they had a lot of work put into them and it shows wonderfully. The music is beautifully created and some are very catchy. The topics used in the anime are well as they fit the story and don't seem out of place.\\n\r\nLastly, my opinion.\\n\r\nLove Live! is one of those animes that can bring a smile to my face. i love how Sunrise has created a wonderful story what captures your attention and makes you fall in love with the characters with me loving Nozomi because how funny she is and of course her hair. The songs really makes this anime, one of my favorites to watch and i really enjoy. The animation itself shows me how much hard work has been put into this and i like to say it probably one the best looking animes i ever seen.\\n\r\nNow for the Verdict.\\n\r\nLove Live! is a wonderful created animes that shows you that you don't need over the top story to make a great story. The art design is beautiful created and the songs will make you fall in love with it as they have been created with a lot of care. Love Live! is one anime i can recommend anyone to watch as it can be enjoyed by all and i say one of the best animes out there.",

            "content": "Before I started watching Love Live! School Idol Project, I was a bit hesitant about going into it. I'm not entirely sure whether it was the fact that I was a huge K-On!  fan and didn't want to accept other similar animes or the fear I have for too many main characters at once because I dislike overly complex/confusing stories.\r\nBut I have to say that all my hesitations were blown away right at the first episode, as I continued I discovered that  this anime is to one of the most lovely anime I have ever seen.\r\nNow onto the 5 parts of ratings:\r\nStory -8\\n\\n\r\nI found the story to be quite original in its own way, the dream to become an idol isn't anything unseen in the anime world but Love Live! School Idol Project managed to set it up in a magnificent way. You don't often see students doing everything they can to save their school, and in this anime they do it in a very uncommon way.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9\\n\\n\r\nVery high quality art, lots of bright colors, I love it.\\n\r\nThe first thing that really caught my attention was the way their eyes were drawn. Eyes of other animes really pales in comparison to these. I found myself looking at those shiny pearls way more often than necessary, maybe Honoka will say :\" Hey! My boobs are down here.\" if you know what I mean.\\n\r\nBut nothing is perfect, the only thing I slightly disliked was the usage of CGI in far away dancing movements, but it wasn't a huge deal because the close ups were drawn.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10\\n\\n\r\nRemember when I said that nothing is perfect? Well here is a 10/10.\\n\r\nThe music in this anime was not only pleasant to the ear, they all had a meaning behind them as well. The way that more and more characters come into the music everytime and make the music even better than it already was is just beautiful. As of today I still listen to many songs of Love Live! School Idol Project regularly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8\\n\\n\r\nThis section is what I feared in the beginning because there are simply too many characters to go over. But Love Live! School Idol Project managed to do a great job at presenting the various characters that appear throughout the show, there are a few characters that we don't know too much about but the stories behind the characters that were showcased more than made up for it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9\\n\\n\r\nI think this will be one of those animes that brighten up my day whenever I feel despressed or lose faith in humanity. I'm also very glad that they made a season 2.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\\n\r\nOne of the most memorable animes I've watched till now, and I was even hesitant at first. \\n\r\nFor those of you who like slice of life or music animes this is a must watch. And for those of you who only watch macho stuff and think this is too sissy/girly, you should at least give this anime a try, because trust me this is no generic school anime that you despise.\\n",

            "content": "Cute girls doing Cute things? \r\nTo an extent, that was what i expected of this show at a glance, but i was pleasantly surprised to find a notable depth; a captivating depiction of \"idol\" life.\r\nI was drawn in by the music; which combined with the immaculate artwork gives Love Live some of the best anime audiovisuals ever. As for the way everything pans out, the show is generally quite upbeat, though very capable of heartwarming and emotional moments too.\r\nThis inspirational (in the classic anime way) journey of a few ordinary high school girls attempting to reach the top ranking of idol bands is a motivationaland uplifting one; and it combines casual SoL elements with a very set-in-stone goal that gives the show its purpose, and the viewers, their reason to keep watching.\\n\\n\r\nIn many ways, this is a delicate anime: as one will find from the malleable emotions of the characters, and the well studied approach from U's perspective. This allows the show to be taken more seriously, and break the mold of stereotypical idol series'. Not to imply of course that Love Live defies convention - as it doesn't, though this isn't a restraint.\\n\\n\r\nMoving over to the show's ability to move its audience... Love Live invests a significant portion of episode time into enhancing its overall depth, attachment values to the cast, and their friendly chemistry. This is a valiant move for a short series, but It makes the world of difference to the show's personal and sentimental values: enough to render the anime vivid, yet not over baked, cheap, or detracting from its musical infrastructure.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to 12 and 13 episode anime series', there are those that focus on story, and those that focus on characters; and though i'm certain that Love Live is character based, the story (although unoriginal) does deliver. Its goal oriented simplicity and method does render it very direct, and perhaps leads people to underestimate; though Sunrise had its way and managed to bring about some more gripping moments that really conveyed the seemingly effortless attachment values of Love Live.\\n\\n\r\nLove live is inescapably a cliche, and you know what this implies, but due to its subtly powerful presentation methods, charming and heartwarming atmosphere, it breaks away nicely, and so its a show i wouldn't be embarrassed to share...\\n\\n\r\nBut be prepared to share twice, as it's perhaps the most obvious \"hinter\" ever when it comes to announcing its sequel - which, though i won't explain now, is likely to be a must watch for viewers of this series. Why? Well, i just finished this, and i feel like things are just getting started; so a follow up review to its sequel when i get around to it.\\n\\n\r\nWould i recommend Love Live?\\n\r\nWell, definitely: now usually i would say WHO i think would enjoy most, but i think that this time around, EVERYONE should give this one a try if they were considering it - as it's a somehow refreshing take on a rehashed premise; and for action junkies, it's an appropriate introduction to the world of casual representation.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "\"Love Live School Idol Project huh?\", that's was I'm asking myself and I think maybe I will give a shot since the movie will be aired on GSC so why not. After finished watching first season, I question myself \"why i did'nt watch this anime earlier?\". This, my friend is one of the most amazing idol anime,of course there are many more idol anime such as AKB0048, Wake up Girls, Idolmaster and many more. But, LL gives me something that makes me want to jump and clapping after they finished their songs.\r\nLove Live School Ido Project start with main character,Honoka who adore idol since itwas awesome but the happy moment did'nt stay long after hearing her school gonna shut down. With determination, she and her other two friend,Kotori and Umi decide to create school idol to save school from close. Their fun,sad moment goes on as they reqruit more member and create more songs. I would say, to protect-school-from-close story was not the strong point of this anime but the member of \"muse\"(their team name) since each of them have different personality with their own backstory.\\n\\n\r\nFor animation, I did'nt really sceptical about it and I find it pretty much satisfying seeing them dance and sing with full energetic. The producers did a good job handling 3D CGI when they dance and other scene which are fluid and nice. For music and OST, since this is school idol anime, I'm expecting it more energetic song and it did'nt dissappoint me. Moreover, it keeps getting better and more charater songs keep getting produce until now. One more thing, I recommend to watch with speaker or earphones to feel the music to the max. \\n\\n\r\nVerdict: I would recommended this anime for those who want to watch some freaking cute and beautiful girls dance and sing in stage. To tell the truth, their dance and songs did gives me goosebump and speechless especially episode 3(trust me,you will feel that). For the rating, it easily get 10/10.\\n",

If you haven't start watch this anime. Please don\u2019t read it. Thanks. \r\nMost of the people gaining or losing something during their lifetime.\r\nMost people start to follow their dream start on the high school year.\r\nHow many trust friends will you have once you finish the high school? How many happiness or sorrow did you get during the high school year?\r\nMy Comment: The story maybe will keep going. Hope this anime will have season three. if you guyslove this anime story or music and there is a game for this, it called \u201c Love live school idol festival\u201d. Different story, but same character and more songs.\\n\\n\\n\r\nHere is my personal review for this anime:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\r\n\u201cLove live school idol project\u201d is mostly based on the school idol girl have their strong friendship with their friends. In this anime there friendship is more important than everything. The story have many touching feeling parts.\\n\r\nThe entire main story is most about, Honoka who is second years of Otonokizaka High School. One day, \u03bc's club has been created(this name was created by Nozomi, and it mean \u03bc's will going to have nine members.)by having an idea from the A-rise, so she think that she can create a love live club to save the school. the school is going to close down. The nine of the \u03bc's members finally join into the \u03bc's and start to stop the school being closed down. They follow their dream to become a best \u201c love live\u201d group during the second season. They believed every will be possible, if they try to doing it. On the first season,  \u03bc's members try to stop let the school close down, and second season is mostly about love live contest. It make me felt so exciting watching second season. The sad part of the story is  on the very end of the second season, which that the members make a greatest memory to the \u03bc's, because the third year students( Nozomi, Eri, and nico) are all going to graduate. So \u03bc's members will going to retire once they complete the contest. The story was truly show that there friendship will never be gone even the \u03bc's this club was gone after the graduation.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\n-Music: I really enjoy the music in this story, because this is a music anime. XD All the music song are amazing\u2026. I like most of the songs specially the song \u201cLove wing bell\u201d is one of my best love live song(Season 2 episode 5) The all the voice of each characters are great too. \\n\r\n-Sound effect: There are nothing wrong to the sound effect.\\n\r\n-Soundtrack: The soundtracks of the anime in the story was all perfect fit to the story.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nThe all characters in this anime are all awesome, because they are care to each other and have great emotion. Each character have their special ability to the \u03bc's. Each 3 \u03bc's members are in the same grade in the high school. Rin, Hanayo, and Maki are the first year student, Honoka, Kotori, and Honoka are the second year student, and finally Nozomi, Eri, and nico are the third year student. Here is my rate for each \u03bc's members. \\n\r\nHonoka: 9/10\\n\r\nEri: 9/10\\n\r\nRin: 9/10\\n\r\nHanayo: 7/10\\n\r\nKotori: 8/10\\n\r\nMaki: 10/10\\n\r\nUmi: 9/10\\n\r\nNico: 7/10\\n\r\nNozomi: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 10/10\\n\r\nOn the animation the character\u2019s art are cute and beautiful. The setting of the anime are also a suck great work.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nMy enjoyment of this anime is very high, because this anime have show a lot of emotions. I laugh and cry in this anime. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nNozomi quote:\\n\r\n\u201cDo you know what the most important thing about climbing a mountain is? It\u2019s not about having the courage to challenge it, it\u2019s about having the courage to back down.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nMy favorite episode:\\n\r\nSeason 1:   EPISODE: 3, 8, 9, 13\\n\r\nSeason 2:   EPISODE: 3, 5, 8, 11, 13\\n\\n\r\nMy favorite conversation from the story:\\n\r\nScene 1:\\n\r\nUmi: \u201cIt\u2019s looks like this is the only place we have\u201d\\n\r\nKotori: \u201cThere\u2019s no shade, and we won\u2019t able to practice when it rains, but we don\u2019t really have any other choice\\n\r\nHonoka: \u201cYeah, but at least we won\u2019t have to worry about staying quiet here. Alright, time for us to practice. Hey, Kotori-chan, Umi-chan. Let\u2019s see this through to the end.\u201d\\n\r\nHonoka: \u201cWe did it.

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nOne thing that anime does better than any other medium is in its ability to create insanely cute female characters. This includes the entire spectrum: kids who make you smile at their adorable way of talking and acting, high school girls who behave in funny or silly ways, and women who are both beautiful and sexy. And since anime is mostly a male dominated form of entertainment, we see many shows featuring these cute girls. When it comes to Love Live! School Idol Project, it is no different in that regard, but it is able to stand outin more ways than one.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nLove Live! 1 stars three friends, Honoka, Umi, and Kotori, who, upon learning that their school is going to be shut down due to terrible enrollment rates, decide to start their own \"School Idol Club\" in order to attract more students to keep the school open.\\n\\n\r\nRather ambitious right out of the gate! The show has this main goal in mind, but for the most part, the show is just \"cute girls doing cute things.\" And it's something that the show does very well. Something that I liked a lot while watching the show was the way in which the characters were able to constantly show their cute sides. Since this is the main draw, it's important that it is also well done. I constantly found myself smiling at the way Honoka would become way too energetic for her own good or Nico spouting out her common catch-phrase, \"Nico-Nico-Ni!\" It was also a boon that the characters worked quite well together. Meaning, they were able to be cute not only on their own but also in tandem with one another. This gave the group greater appeal and much more lasting impression.\\n\\n\r\nGetting back to the main \"plot,\" these types of shows like to do usually the same thing. That is, do a nice job in the \"cute girl\" department and then inject some rather lame drama in order to spice things up. Sadly, LL1 follows the same trope. Much of the drama that takes place in LL1 takes on one of two forms: it either is resolved extremely quickly (within one episode) or it is inconsequential. The former I'm a bit more forgiving towards. This type of drama was mainly used to showcase the characters and get them to finally become a part of the music group. The latter I am less forgiving about. If you are going to instill these dramatic elements and not use them for anything, it seems rather shallow. I would rather the show just stick to what it does best, and that is let the girls be cute, rather than just trying to make drama where there doesn't need to be.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nI wasn't sure how well LL1's animation was going to be going in, but I was rather surprised going out.\\n\\n\r\nStarting with the art style, it is not a stretch to say that it is plain but modern. The backgrounds and environments are the typical kinds: school grounds, rooftop, local shrine, etc. They have nice detail, but are nothing extraordinary.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation, however, is very good. This includes both the School Idol segments and the non-School Idol Segments. The dancing parts are definitely the highlight of the show. What I found interesting was in its mix of both CG and 2D animation. It would flip-flop between the two while the girls were performing, giving this cool effect of me not fully knowing if what I was watching was CG or 2D. Yes, you can tell at certain times, but for the most part, I was pretty impressed. This is coming from someone who normally hates CG in anime.\\n\\n\r\nWhen the girls are not dancing, the animation is actually very fluid. Their facial expressions aren't instant, their leg and arm movements aren't rigid, and their hair and eyes are always changing. Even when there are many characters on the screen at once, the show does a nice job of making everything move smoothly.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the character designs, its tough making everyone seem unique when working with such a large cast. At nine characters, LL1 does an okay job in this regard. They mainly stick to just differing hairstyles to differentiate the girls, but for the most part, I enjoyed their modern look. It reminded me a bit of KyoAni designs, but not as detailed.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThere are quite a bit of characters in LL1. \u03bc's (pronounced \"Muse\") have nine School Idols that take the roles as the main cast. I won't talk about all of them, but I will delve into some of my favorites.\\n\\n\r\nNozomi is the student council vice president and acts as the \"mother\" of the group throughout the show. She is mainly there to listen to the characters, to guide their thoughts, and to make sure that the group as a whole works together. She always knows when someone is worried or troubled and she always goes out of her way to make things right. While she has a rather strange fetish of groping the girls when worst comes to worst, she is generally the most calm and level-headed, giving her a nice contrast in comparison to everyone else.\\n\\n\r\nHanayo is quite passionate about being a School Idol. But her biggest problem is her extreme shyness. Due to this, she is rather cute in the way she acts around others and in how she goes about her daily life. Hanayo is one of the first girls to experience growth and change within the show, and it was nice to see her get out of her comfort zone at least a little bit. One thing that made me slightly sad was the omission of her glasses later on, since it was unique to her character. But this doesn't dissuade her from still being a rather adorable girl.\\n\\n\r\nProbably my favorite from the cast is Honoka. Not only is she the leader type, but she is generally the most optimistic and enthusiastic. She loves to have fun, to try hard, and to motivate her friends. On top of all this, she is quite hilarious during the show due to her overzealous nature. Her reactions to tough practices or attempting to get someone to do her bidding managed to get a big grin on my face every single time.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, while I could go on with the rest, suffice it to say that the other characters are just as good. What the show does well is that it not only makes each girl likable/lovable/cute but also that it gives them all appropriate screen time. Some shows have a difficult time showcasing their characters when the cast gets too large. But I found that all of the girls had about equal screen-time during the show (minus Honoka because she's, understandably, the main lead).\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I don't absolutely love these characters, but they are all entertaining to watch individually and as a group, which made my time watching this season that much more enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nLL1 is a music show. As such, the sound within is of pretty high quality. The OP is a tried and true pop idol song. It fits the show perfectly, both in its beat, lyrics, and visuals. The ED is less dancing and more about the girls showing off their singing skills. For both, I found that I liked them quite a bit while watching the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack features common music pieces, for dramatic and happy moments, but the highlights are once again the School Idol songs. The show features about three different songs in total that the girls sing and dance to, and all of them are nicely composed and fun to watch and listen to.\\n\\n\r\nFor the voice acting, I found that everyone did an above average job. Each of the girls has a unique voice to them, and I loved listening to them all. Special shout out to Yurika Kubo for her role as Hanayo, because she was able to give her this normal yet whisper-y voice that I haven't heard elsewhere.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nThe reason you watch these types of shows isn't for the grandiose plot, the complex characterization, or for the intricate world building. You watch this show because you just want to have fun and see cute girls acting cute. Certain fans of anime might not like how anime itself is somewhat devolving into just showcasing cute girls, but there are shows like this that do an above average job.\\n\\n\r\nLL1 is quite funny. A lot of the humor comes from the character interactions and the way they act. Their personalities are all generally uplifting, and even the ones that aren't (such as Maki) provide comedic scenarios for the other characters.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond that, I also really liked watching the girls perform their dances. Wearing their cute outfits, singing in harmony, and giving it their all was fun to watch. I actually wasn't expecting the amount of dancing and singing that I was given, which was a pleasant surprise in the long-run.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Love Live! School Idol Project sets itself up to be a show about a group of friends who just want to sing, dance, and have fun together. And you know what? That's exactly what the show did.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, cute girls with unneeded drama\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Good, plain art-style with superb animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, all different with something for everyone\\n\\n\r\nSound: Great, nice OP, ED, idol songs, and VAs\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good, funny and cute puts a smile on your face\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 7/10",

There\u2019s virtually nothing that could hold us back. We were naive, we were clumsy, and we made mistakes. But hey, it\u2019s all part of growing up, no?

(Not to mention I actually finished this in a day)\\n\\n\r\nSkipping past the synopsis, Love Live Season 1 has a clear plot direction: forming a school idol group in order to boost the popularity of their school. In the process, more and more girls were recruited, often through emotional means, and it wasn\u2019t long enough where they were all gathered together and went on to strive further: challenging the Love Live school idol contest. \\n\\n\r\nThroughout the series, we see how the girls, each with their own personalities and quirks, come to terms together for one single cause. Honoka, Kotori and Umi form the backbone of the group, being the original trio who formed the group, and the series ended up focusing on them the most. The other 6 girls do get their well-deserved screen time as well, but 13 episodes isn\u2019t very much, luckily we do have another season, so hope is not all lost should you desire to see more of these girls. \\n\\n\r\nBecoming a school idol group isn\u2019t easy, having the dream alone doesn\u2019t cut it. In the anime, we were shown how hard the girls work to achieve their goals, how much effort and emotions that were put into. Whenever one\u2019s in trouble, another will quickly come to console them; whenever an obstacle is put ahead of them, they face it together; whatever fun they have, they enjoy it together. Their actions pure and sincere, and it does make you feel like wanting to be like them. Which is why I mentioned before, that this anime serves as a great motivation for teenagers and adults alike. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation and soundtrack wise, this anime is top notch. The performances are nothing less than spectacular, blending in CG effects to the animation flawlessly. For the music, you have tons of songs from these girls to enjoy from, and when they aren't singing, the bgm serves very well to support the emotions of the scene. \\n\\n\r\nThe message conveyed through Love Live is simple: \u201cIf you love something, go for it.\u201d Such a short yet powerful message served us greatly to remind ourselves, what are you waiting for? What are you holding back for? Do you have a dream on your own? Go for it then!\\n",

            "content": "*THIS IS MY FIRST REVIEW, SO PLEASE BE NICE! :D*\r\n(TL;DR version at the bottom)\r\nI stopped watching anime a long time ago (when death note came out and everyone was fonboying about it everywhere, it made me sick) and I though I wouldn't ever watch anime again. A friend of mine told me a couple of months ago \"you don't have the amount of kawaii in your life you really need, kinda like Love live\" so I decided to watch it.\r\nI went into it knowing perfectly well that this was an idol anime, mainly aimed to teen audiences and fully aware of what kind of musicI should expect. To put things into perspective, if you haven't guessed by my user name I'm mainly a fan of deathcore, hardcore, all genres of metal and hardcore music basically. \\n\\n\r\nI then started the first chapter at around 11pm in the night. What follows is the total actual truth: next day I went to the office where I work at and watched the whole first season as soon as I arrived. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is simple, yet gripping, the school is about to close and the only solution seemingly possible is to start a school idol group to bring more students to the school and stop its closure. What is gripping of this plot is all that the girls involved in the group have to endure to get to their prime and make it so they get their name known to others and bring some joy and happiness to people while being happy themselves.\\n\\n\r\nEach song has a meaning in how the plot has developed so far, and each song has its own unique sound and lyrics that all make sense and leave you thinking on what they mean and what they teach you. A total of 28 songs are played across all seasons/movie and you'll remember each and everyone of them, all the lyrics and you'll end up downloading the songs and having them wether on your smartphone or music player of preference and playing them over and over again (they actually have around 60+ songs, not counting the sub-units songs and they're all amazing).\\n\\n\r\nNow, the characters, they all have their own distinct personalities and artistic direction. Their voices and ways of acting all make you love them more and more (fyi, Rin/Honoka best waifus <3). Some songs have a \"main\" singer for them which is related to what happened in the episode and you'll say \"this is honoka's song\" or \"this is umi's song\". All characters have hilarious reactions when the funny moments happen as well as their own emotional responses when the anime goes into feels land.\\n\\n\r\nYou never watched an idols/musical anime? Watch this, and none other will match it after doing so. It's not just a story of 9 girls trying to save their school from closing, it's a story about fighting for your dreams, a story about finding hope and strength when all is against you, it's about not letting anything get in your way and pummel through all the bad reputation, naysayers and making your dreams come true. I watched Clannad, Clannad:AS, Kanon, Angel Beats, etc. and as much as they have taught me valuable lessons, nothing comes close to what Love Live has taught me and what it has done to my life and my way of getting through each day. Perseverance, following your dreams, never back down and above all, love life and enjoy every second of it, wether it is doing what you like or fighting against all odds, cause in the end it's all worth it. \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR version: \\n\\n\r\n(watched LLSIP, LLSIP 2nd season and LLSIP Movie)\\n\\n\r\nThe music is impeccable, each song sounds different from each other and the dance routines for each of them will make you learn the lyrics in no time even if you don't know any japanese. The characters are all loveable and not one of them feels out of place (Rin-chan/Honoka-chan best waifus!) as they all have their own stories that are developed during the whole anime. A simple yet convincing and gripping story on how fighting against all odds to make your dreams come true can take you to the top and make your life what you always wanted it to be. Truly a masterpiece that makes your heart warm and happy all the time and leaves you with a beautiful life lesson after finishing it. Don't miss it even if you're not used to SOL animes, to tell you the truth I wasn't into them either, and Love Live! got me into them in an instant.\\n\r\nMy only complaint: the 3D is kinda shitty at some points.",

            "content": "\"The only I thing I want to drop like it's hot is this anime off my watchlist\" -Snoop Dogg when asked about Love Live! at MangaCon3030.\r\nLove Live! An anime I've avoided watching for a long time as I'm not big into musical shows, however after seeing it plastered everywhere and recieve very positive reviews, I decided I'd give it a go. Love Live is that guy who gets bullied by everyone in the class including you. You don't mean to bully them, but their is just something about them that makes you. They're weird. Is it their speech, the way they dress, or how theygo on about odd things? You don't quite know but you sure don't like them. Let's dissect why you don't like them together.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3\\n\r\nPerhaps I'm being a bit harsh with the score here, as plenty of anime have sub standard plots that are driven through by comedic elements and flashy gimmicks and I wouldn't rate them badly. However, I like my anime to have some kind of worthwhile story to it, something that immerses and captivates me at some level. In my opinion, Love Live! lacks that ability. The school Honoka and her friends Nozomi and Kotori attend is on the brink of closure due to nobody wanting to attend. To remedy this, they decide to form a school idol club in the hopes of attracting more people. That's it. That's the entire season. The full 13 episodes feels like it covers as much as even the most slow paced anime cover in about 5, with setting up the idol club and recruiting more members. Basically nothing happens. The formula that has been given for this season is girls want to perform a song. They need stuff like lyrics and dance moves for the song. Spend an episode setting it up and delivering it. Spend the next episode adding a new character to the cast, rinse repeat. I already find the motivations of the characters stupid. I enjoyed my time at secondary school, I really did, and if it closed down even now I'd be upset. But there is no way on gods green earth that I, or anybody I know for that matter, would do anything tangible to stop the closure, and yet this school has about 6 people who are going to do everything they can to stop it. I also know that this is a cultural difference and maybe they have them over there, but school idols sound like such a farfetched and silly thing, and even if they are a big thing in Japan, why would any parent let a kid join a school soley based on the fact that between three and six girls who will be gone within two years do singing and dancing at a good level (in an extra curricular club that no staff have invested any time or money in). By that logic I should go find the tree Issac Newton sat under and get it to teach me, because a famous man learnt there. This is again, the whole show. There's nothing new and the constant smiley never give up sunshine and love attitude gets on your nerves after a certain amount of time. There are a lot of points where you think something will happen, either an argument or some big thing stemming from an issue and instead they just sweep it under the rug and decide to be cheerful.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nI wanted to like the art. I really did. And the art itself isn't the problem to be fair. On the whole Love Live! emmits a vibrant cheery attitude through its art style, with crisp clean and nice looking images. But. And it's a big but. CGI. C-god damn GI. This is far and away the worst part of Love Live! This show contains a lot of singing and dancing, usually one (but sometimes more) songs per episode, and in every song they will just jump cut between hand drawn and CGI at random points. I'm not a fan of CGI in general, but if you're going to use it for the songs at least stick to it. Instead you just get this mishmash of awfulness where they go from flat to 3d and back again constantly, completely ruining and enjoyment you may have had watching the song.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 7\\n\r\nLove Live! Has good music. It's no Shigatsu but the music is catchy and upbeat. I'm not a big fan of Idol type music but I can still listen through this without wanting to kill myself so I consider that well done on Love Live!'s part. Also they gave us Snow Halation (2nd season) which is a meme now. Check out SiIva gunner for some dank memeage (Definitely the best thing about this show).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4\\n\r\nI don't understand why people seem to love these characters. They're all their own brand of bland and boring. \"But Gandalf!\" I hear you cry \"They're all so different and Kawaii, how could you say such mean things?\" Firstly, any of you who was fine with the use of Kawaii please leave. Secondly, these hyper caricatures of super sweetness aren't interesting or fleshed out in any way. Just making them different is not enough to give them a personality. We firstly start with Honoko, the pig headed, dumb one who just charges ahead and does what she wants. She is the only thing that drives this story, and the plot will basically form around her saying \"We need to do X\", somebody else saying no, and her going ahead and doing it any way. Her stupidity is only matched by her sickeningly sweet kindness, which isn't endearing but becomes obnoxious. Kotori is next, take the sweetness again, add a really high pitched and annoying voice, and stick her in a secret maid costume and hey you have a Kotori. She is basically worse Honoka, and ends up doing the same sort of shit she does, but just doesn't get as much screen time because she isn't the mainest of main characters. Then we have Umi. If Honoka is the main driving force of the plot Umi is the one that is there purely so the viewer doesn't ask \"How did they get so good without doing anything.\", Umi's only job is to tell the others to train. That's it. She'll tell them they need to run more, or do more exrecise, or eat less, or get ready for singing. Basically if X needs to be done and it doesn't fit in with Honoka's personality to do it, it's Umi's turn to day something. Maki is basically again discount Umi, someone who is constantly annoyed and constantly telling the others to do stuff, but again doesn't get as much screen time. Then we have Nico. Arguably the only one with any personality to speak of but still just as annoying as the rest. She wants to be an idol but has a terrible personality. She is one of those characters that everyone makes fun of/ignores (and usually calls gross but the show is too everybody friendly to call anybody gross), even when they do something good or clever, which is a trope I've never enjoyed. Nico has a dark side however. Her idol persona is so sickly sweet you will definitely get diabetes from watching it. The first time watching the contrast between her and her persona is kind of funny and I'll admit gave me a chuckle, but it soon wears off when it's used again and again. Then we have Nozomi. She's the standard breast groping character. That's her condensed down. She does divination and gropes other peoples' breasts. Eri is the final girl and is possibly one of the worst of them. She acts like a stuck up knob for the first 8 or so episodes, attacking the rest of them with everything she has, whilst simultaneously trying to save the school by asking the chairman to allow them to \"Take action\", whatever that means. I'm assuming she had some great idea up her sleeve to save the school that the chairman just wouldn't allow... Oh wait. Then it turns out she hates the idea of the idol club and seems to harbour a resentment for dancing because she was a professional ballet dancer when she was younger. It then cuts to a clip of her losing a competition at a very young age. Now most shows would take this in the direction of her parents were harsh/told her winning is everything, and made her dance/punished her for now winning. In this one the kindly mother tells her it was ok to lose and that she did her best. Cut back to Eri scowling. How this is supposed to signify her hatred for them (hatred is a very strong word as she joins their group almost immediately after) I don't know. It's not even implied that she doesn't have time to dance anymore because of her family/busy life so I really don't get what they were pushing for here.\\n\r\nJust to help everyone out, Id like to clarify I don't hate nice things, or when things go well, and that nice happy characters can be good characters. It's just that this niceness is these characters personalities. They do nothing but go around basically going \"I better be nice today guys. Hoo here's me being nice again. Isn't it swell?\" They all seem to have one personality trait or feature and just amplify it 10fold. That isn't how you make a good character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\r\nThe show is meh at best. It's a cutesy feel goody thing that just tries to pump you full of \"If we do things hard enough it'll work\", and \"Friendship is the way to go!\". If you're a bit more of a normal person that won't be your thing, but if it is, this show is a 10/10 for you.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\r\nIt's alright. It'll get you through a rainy afternoon or a long car journey if you have nothing else available to you, but it certainly isn't something you should be prioritising over other anime. Should you watch Love Live!?\\n\r\nNot unless you love diabetes.",

            "content": "Ever since I've seen Zombieland Saga in during anime season Fall 2018, I felt a bit embarrassed because I liked 'an idol anime' and I felt later browsing trough MAL's database for other idol anime I eventually wanted to see next for that similair expierence. One of these shows is Love Live! School Idol Project that came out in 2013. It was just after a fellow MAL user suddenly updated his MAL page that he had seen one episode of this show, gave it a 1 and dropped it (as a joke), it really made me curious if it really was THAT bad or not.Turns out, it really was a good expierence!\\n\\n\r\nGrab your glowstick and let's get right into it!\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10 (Fine)\\n\r\nOtonokizaka High School is on the verge of closing down due the lack of new students that sign-up and second year Honoka decides to start up a school idol group to try the school to stop from closing because she got inspired from another school idol group. That's basicly it the story of this anime. The story is pretty simple to follow, but the ammount of effort to make the story entertaining was done well. Throughout the show, they include showing what the characters need to endure to become idols which include vocal, stamina and dance training. You know, that really gives it a nice touch to include and helped with character development quite well to say the least so I'm not complaining.\\n\\n\r\nArt-style: 7/10 (Good)\\n\r\nFor a TV series that's very populair appearantly, you expect the art-style has to be good right? Yeah, well, I can agree on that. It's known for sure that in idol anime that the CGI sections that often get used for the performances etc. often butchererd and tore the show apart, but in the case for Love Live! School Idol Project that's not really the case it seems. In matter in fact, the CGI sections are quite baareable to say the least and that's coming from a guy that really just can't stand CGI use in anime. Sure, you will reconize when the animators decided to use CGI instead, but it's not horrible done that's it an eye-sore. Beside the minor drop in quality in animation when using CGI, the show is a pleasant watch for the eye in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10 (Good)\\n\r\nIf You're watchiung an anime that's centred around music, you'd expect the sound, voice acting & the songs has to be good right? Well, in the case for Love Live School Idol Project they have gotten that right atleast for me. The opening song called 'Bokura wa Ima no Naka de' is in matter in fact pretty hype if you tell me! After the first time I've heare it I really felt the urge to open up my speakers and blasting the opening song so even my neighbors could enjoy the fact I'm about to watch an episode of Love Live! School Idol Project. The ending song is decent aswell, but not as hype as the opening song one. The ending song is done by the several voice actors that worked on the show for instance. The insert songs are done well aswell, but it's not like I would go and download the songs for listening in my daily life. I'm not that infected by 'idol anime' (yet?).\\n\\n\r\nCharathers: 7/10 (Good)\\n\r\nThe first 3 main characters in this anime that you get introduced are Honoka; who is seriously hyper and energetic, Umi who was reluctant to become a school idol at first and Kotori who is a very calm and little bit with her head in the clouds. In case you're wondering; my favorite girl of this idol group has to be Kotori for sure. There's something special with anime girls with their head into the clouds. Perhaps it's because I'm either blessed and cursed that I'm a vivid daydreamer, so I can understand the charather their struggles the must.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10 (Very Good)\\n\r\nI really have to be lying if I can't say say I didn't enjoyed Love Live: School Idol Project. The story is so simple, the humor is very enjoyable and really made me legit crack up at several times, the charathers are lovely, the music was nice, ... Atleast now I can understand now why this anime is so wel recieved worldwide. I expected this show to be one cringe-worthy meme fest, but it's quite the opposite! Just imagne watching K-On! for all it's moe you can think off, but instead of all the moe you would expect you will get weaponized glorious autism with even more cute anime girls to fight over who's best girl or what not! Despite all that and a little bit of overreacting and making a bit of fun out of this anime, the anime still can be serious at times.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10 (Good)\\n\r\nI'd hate it to admit it, but... *sigh* but yes, I did enjoyed the first season of Love Love! School Idol Project. I guess it's time to one day watch the second season of this anime and the following movie one day and maybe perhaps one day watch the other spin-off. Is it safe to come out of the closet and tell the anime community on MyAnimeList I perhaps can be considered nowadays as potentional new glorious idol trash?! Because I do. Sort off. There! Are you happy now? Yes, I did enjoyed it, but giving this anime a higher number then a solid 7 out of 10 I really just can't do.\\n",

They also present amazing development, that character you love can make you hate her in a matter of minutes and viceversa.\r\n-Animation. It has a good artstyle, nothing too extraordinary. The CGI is smooth but the dances seem unnatural in the sense that they looked kind of bugged or looped.\r\n-Music. One of the strongest points ofthe series. It presents memorable tracks (mostly) with a unique meaning/background that emphasizes the impact of each song and an amazing opening that hypes you up for each episode. \\n\\n\r\n-The slice of life element. It's less fan service than I had expected, and is actually enjoyable from time to time, helping some characters to boost their development.\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\\n\r\nCharacter Development. Eventhough there are many good and developed characters like Umi, Honoka or Eli, there are others that lack development and feel kind of hollow, for instance Hanayo and Nozomi. \\n\\n\r\nThe comedy. There's some obvious instances when the show tries to become funny but the humour feels mostly out of place. It's not that each attempt is bad, but many of them are put in the wrong moment to be put in.\\n\\n\r\nSome of the character arcs. I don't want to enter into spoiler territory, but there are some character arcs that are shoved in at the last minute. The arcs itself are not bad, but they're so limited in time that they end up feeling rushed or somewhat forced. \\n\\n\r\nTo sum up, Love Live: School Idol Project is a very enjoyable show to watch, it may not be a masterpiece but it is not mediocre either, it has some notable flaws but nothing too bad to detract the enjoyment I had with this show.",

My only problem with it was when they dance, they use VERY noticeable CG. \r\nSo when I watch the dances, it's usually sometimes hard for me to enjoy because I can't help but cringe sometimes. Other than that, it's a very great anime and you should probably give it a watch.\r\nThe first episode was very rushed and it'd seem very confusing and boring but I promise you that the whole anime is VERY interesting and it is worth the watch!",

            "content": "Welcome to my review of Love Live! School Idol Project. At the time of writing this review I have completed watching the series. This review might be late, but this Anime is one of my all-time favorites and I hope you guys can take the time to see what I think about it. \r\nConsidering the time of writing this review, it will cover both the 1st and 2nd Season of the Anime series and will be about how the series is done as a whole.\r\nI'll put this section here early in case you guys miss it. Do visit my blog section on my profile afterreading my review for an Afterthoughts pertaining to this particular Anime for some healthy discussion. Thanks!\\n\\n\r\nHere goes:\\n\\n\r\n1) Story (9/10)\\n\\n\r\n- For a school idol-based Anime, one would expect the story to be focused on the main idol group or personality. Instead, what is portrayed in this Anime is the individual character development. There are 9 people in the group, and so 9 different stories (or Arcs, as you would call it) are shown in the Anime. Indirectly, the focus on individual characters boosted the story of their school idol unit as a whole. I find this to be a very interesting point to note and that the audience wouldn't get bored because the Anime doesn't just stick to one character all the time.\\n\\n\r\n2) Art (8/10)\\n\\n\r\n- The colors and design are what you would expect; bright and vibrant with a healthy mix of different looks for each character. Once again, you should notice the focus on individual characters here. Each of them are unique in their own right and have different personalities to distinguish one another apart. The use of sakura blossoms brightens up the atmosphere as well.\\n\\n\r\n3) Sound (9/10)\\n\\n\r\n- Coming from a school idol Anime, sound is pretty much one of the most important points you would expect to be good.And it is. From the development of the music to how it is played and acted out, they are almost perfectly done and there is little to nothing to nitpick about. \\n\\n\r\n4) Character (10/10)\\n\\n\r\n- Normally, I'd rarely give out a full mark score for any category. However, the character portion of this Anime series is really well done. As mentioned before, the individual character focus give time for each of them to develop and makes for an exciting and fun to watch series. Each featured character has their own spotlight in the series and are given their own freedom and space to gel with the idol unit so that they become closer to one another, if that is not enough, the unit even has outings together to ensure that they have fun with one another. I cannot mention this enough, the character portion of the series is really a stand-out point.\\n\\n\r\n5) Enjoyment (9/10)\\n\\n\r\n- The Anime series starts off with a curious development right off the bat; having to save the school from closing down. (Not a spoiler; it's mentioned in the synopsis.) How that develops, I won't mention further. The series then moves to the formation of the idol unit, its development and growth while simultaneously focusing on character development for each of the nine members. All in all, the series is really fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\n6) Overall (9/10)\\n\\n\r\n- I came to know of this Anime series through a friend's recommendation and I'm glad I gave it a shot. It's a great choice for anyone looking for a school idol Anime to watch and I would definitely recommend it myself. There wasn't a point in the Anime in which I disliked; it was well done in every aspect. For those who haven't watched the series, do give it a go and tell me what you think about it!",

It's just my opinion but I just love the songs Aishiteru Banzai, Start Dash, Snow Halation & The Openings. It's sooo good.\r\nOkay I'm not sure whatto say for the sound in anime but it's very good nothing wrong with anything it's just pure good.\\n\\n\r\nEvery single characters have their own story and each of their own development comes to a liking. My favorite has to be Nishikino Maki cause of her personality and her solo songs. The characters in this anime are likeable and everyone has their own favorites so characters are just so unique in their own way.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime so much that I had to keep watching watching and watching. Hardly got bored I watched this and second season in one day. I have to say I never enjoyed this much in watching anime when I found out about Love Live.\\n\\n\r\nOverall great anime I don't believe there's such thing as a perfect anime as 10/10 so I gave it 9 although I noticed it was only a girl anime. It had no male characters. But that's okay if there isn't it's enjoyable the characters are cute the songs are awesome and I enjoyed it. Would recommend watching this I would rewatch it.",

            "content": "This Review Applies to Both Season of Love Live! School Idol Project and the written Review to my Video Review\r\nStory -  6/10\r\nLove Live has a rather simple story. The school, the girl\u2019s attend is being shut down, because there isn\u2019t simply enough students to fill the school, and they don\u2019t get enough applications from the junior high students to stay open. So as you probably can guess what happens next, a group of girls decide to form an idol group known as \u03bc's. So their aim to get recognized, so that other students come to their school and to do that they enter theLove Live competition, a competition for school idols, to get recognize and save their school, simple enough. 2nd season is more of the same, they enter another Love Live competition but for a different reason, which I won\u2019t go into detail. The story is not what\u2019s important, with this series, with the sound of it\u2019s pretty much a sports anime you can say in some ways, with the slice of life add to it. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nLike I said earlier, there\u2019s not much to get from the story of Love Live, but it\u2019s not story that\u2019ll get you attached to this show, it\u2019s more of the characters interaction with each other. This anime focuses more on the characters and how each one of them develops. There are 9 main characters which form the idol group \u03bc's. Apart from their obvious main character, the rest of the girls pretty much get the same amount of attention to them. \\n\\n\r\nStarting off there is Kousaka Honoka, the center and leader of the group, the one who is always upbeat and tries to keep the group together, even though she is not the best of anything in her group, she always tries hard.\\n\\n\r\nThe other second years is Sonoda Umi and Minami Kotori. Umi pretty much balances Honoka as she is the more level headed friend and thinks logically, she does write the group\u2019s songs, and makes the other girl\u2019s work hard as she is pretty committed to the group even though she doesn\u2019t show it. Kotori makes the group the costumes, and pretty much an air head like Honoka also the fan service moe character type.\\n\\n\r\nThe first years are Koizumi Hanayo, Hoshizora Rin and Nishikino MAKI-CHAN!!! Hanayo is the very shy and quiet reserved type girl, however when it comes to Rice and Idols, she changes from the quiet girl to the very enthusiastic girl. \\n\\n\r\nRin the nyanamazing tomboy of the group, she is considered the most athletic and most coordinated in the group, perhaps due to the being the sporty type and she is considered a great dancer as well.\\n\\n\r\nMaki-chan!!! My favourite character and oshie is the last of the 1st years. She is partly a tsundere, as she doesn\u2019t really show her true feelings when around the group except when she admitted when she believed in Santa. Maki is the composer of group and considered their best singer and she is so kawaii.\\n\\n\r\nAnd last but not least the third years. Ayase Eli, Toujou Nozomi and Yazawa Nico. Eli is like Umi, as she too is more a level headed serious type of character, however she acts this way because she is trying to represent as a role model. She is the choreographer of group along with Umi as she has dancing experiences and also she plans on how the group promote themselves.\\n\\n\r\nNozomi is the wise and voice of reason girl in the group.  She is the spiritual leader of group, literally, as she foresaw the group being made and gave the group the name. She is also the teaser of the group, as she teases the other girls a lot, plus washi washi.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then we have Nico. The split personality loveable girl type. When being an Idol Nico is  probably one of the most adorable beings in the world always smiling, innocent type, but behind that she is most cockiest member of the group believing to be the best. She is a fan girl of idols and also the president of the school\u2019s idol club. \\n\\n\r\nLike I said the show is more about the girls and their development with each other rather than the goal itself. It\u2019s obvious Honoka is main focus majority of the time, but each of the girls have at least have 1 episode to shine, in fact here it is. \\n\\n\r\nUmi \u2013 Season 1 Episode 7\\n\r\nKotori \u2013 Season 1 Episode 9\\n\r\nHanayo \u2013 Season 1 Episode 4\\n\r\nRin \u2013 Season 2 Episode 5\\n\r\nMaki \u2013 Season 1 Episode 10\\n\r\nEli \u2013 Season 1 Episode 8\\n\r\nNozomi \u2013 Season 2 Episode 8\\n\r\nNico \u2013 Season 2 Episode 4\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s feels very episodic, as the most of the time girl\u2019s do something completely difference each episode. But I do recommended watching both seasons to get the full experience, as it really is about the girls. And they\u2019re the strongest aspect to this show.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is pretty well done for what it\u2019s trying to achieve. It\u2019s obvious from the start the animators are trying to make these girl\u2019s look very cute and moe. As they all seem to be blushing regardless. And the colours are very bright as well which fits the very light hearted feel of the anime. \\n\r\nThe problem I found with this anime is part of the moe art style, I didn\u2019t mind the over blushing to much, but it\u2019s applied on the other parts of their bodies. Especially the kneecaps and the elbows, it\u2019s really red. \\n\\n\r\nNow you\u2019re all wondering how the singing and dancing animation is done. The girl\u2019s a 3D and the background is 2D, which is super obvious when they change the animation. I get why they did 3D, as it\u2019s easier to animate the choreography of the girls, but then it makes the girl\u2019s look extremely pale, which I kind of put me off. However it\u2019s done very smoothly, so give them prompts for that. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is nothing to write home about, its pretty unique style that\u2019ll appeal to some people, but some might find it off putting switching from 2D to 3D etc.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nFor me since I am a fan of idols and j-pop, and \u03bc's has become my second favourite idol group, I really enjoyed this anime. It\u2019s really light hearted slice of life musical sports anime, with drama here and there, but most of the time it gives a really happy vibe. You\u2019re not probably not going to like this anime, if you don\u2019t enjoy j-pop music or idol music, and the very cutest style of the animation and characters itself. In fact I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any significant male character in the series, it\u2019s literally all girls. The music is really inspirational, I really enjoyed the music they chose to perform. And they are really catchy.\\n\\n\r\nI kind of wished, Honoka didn\u2019t steal most of the spotlight and like to see more of the other girls, but that just how it works with some idol the groups, the center gets the most attention. \\n\r\nI guess that\u2019s why I love Ebichu so much.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict - 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nSo to summarise quickly, the story is not really much to write home about, but however the characters are a really interesting and developed well and it\u2019s all about the characters, although I would\u2019ve love to see more of the others, other than Honoka. The animation is hit or miss, depending on your taste, if you really like cute, moe animation you\u2019re going to love this, if you don\u2019t you\u2019re probably not going to. And the 3D sequences is well done and smooth, but could\u2019ve been done better with the colours. Music is very catchy and enjoyable and easy to learn if you like j-pop.\\n\r\nWith that out of the way, you\u2019re probably wanting a score from me, so here it is.\\n\r\nI give Love Live! School Idol Project an 8.5/10\\n",

It's only present in some dancing scenes, but it still looked rather weird. The way the characters looked in those scenes reminded me of the texture of poorly printed dakimakuras. \r\nIn the end, Iliked the series and I'd recommend it if you like cute anime girls and cute anime music, but you will need to endure the cringe worthy parts too.",

Of course, I'm obviously missing out some things in that short synopsis of the first few episodes. \\n\r\nThen more girls start joining. And this was, in my opinion, this anime's downfall. I'll explain why in the character section though. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 9\\n\r\nI'm being really biased towards the idol anime genre now. The music was pretty good! Start:Dash was a good song, and the rest of them were also good.\\n\\n\r\nBut nothing's perfect. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 6\\n\r\nThe design of some characters just didn't seem original. Umi almost looked like Mio from K- On. However, the dancing went with the music. And I think that counts as art.\\n\r\nAnd before I forget - the use of the 3D effects gave an unsuspecting kick to the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 3 (WARNING - prepare for rant)\\n\r\nThis is the major downfall. Seriously. \\n\r\nCharacters with more screentime, ideally, should have a well developed backstory. Obviously, because they are main characters. However, if someone joins the main character crew in the middle, they should at least actually be GIVEN a backstory. Rin, for instance. Not one drop of backstory throughout the entire anime. \\n\r\nObviously it was a short anime, but still - if there's no time to add a backstory to a character, why add in the character at all? \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 5\\n\r\nWhile the music was enjoyable, the actual anime wasn't as good. I enjoy knowing backstories though, so the overwhelming lack of them didn't help. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 6\\n\r\nObviously this will appeal to some more than others. But for me, character development is vital for a good anime. \\n\r\nAnd in 13 episodes, 9 characters are not going to be developed. But there is going to be s second season. The question is: will the rest of the characters be developed?\\n\\n\r\nAnd I shall end this with a recommendation.\\n\r\nIf you liked Love Live: School Idol Project, trust me. You. Will. ADORE. The iDOLM@STER.",

            "content": "Disclaimer - This is a review for season 1 only, as I have not yet watched season two.\r\nI went into this show with after seeing plenty of people claim to enjoy it; however, I kept my expectations fairly low as, on the surface, it seemed to be just another \"cute girls doing cute things\" show. So, after watching season one, I can say that assumption was pretty accurate.\r\nStory - 6\r\nLL's story didn't really do much for me. It wasn't too serious or farfetched, it was just average with a few unexpected twists and emotional moments thrown in. If you're looking for a complex story outof your \"cute girls doing cute things\" show, this isn't the show for you.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 4\\n\r\nThe art for this show was easily the worst aspect. Most of the show is animated decently and the character designs are kind of generic, but what really brings the show down is the cg used for the performances. While you won't see the cg a whole lot, it's still pretty jarring to get thrown into a cg scene after watching the characters in their standard animation forms for a long time. They also sometimes do close-ups on the idols' faces and have them make a cute face during performance scenes, which always seem silly. Anyway, the animation is probably the worst part of the show.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 6\\n\r\nGiven that this was an idol show, I expected the music to be the best part of the show, and I wasn't disappointed. Now, I'm a big music guy and I give every type of music a fair chance, but I wasn't too big of a fan of the songs that the cast performed, but I will admit that some of their songs were catchy. The real good the show does is the use of background music to aid the viewer in getting caught in the emotions of certain scene, which always makes a show more enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 4\\n\r\nWhen seeing that there were nine members of the idol group, I was really worried going into the show about how they'd all be able to develop in just 13 episodes. After seeing the first season, my fears were confirmed. The characters were, for the most part, very poorly developed, which led me to not feel any connection to the characters and have way more questions than I'm comfortable with having about them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7\\n\r\nDespite low scores throughout earlier categories, I ended up enjoying this show. I didn't really have too much trouble getting immersed in the show, but there were several instances where that immersion was broken which damped my enjoyment of the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 6\\n\r\nLL didn't fall short of my expectations, because even though it doesn't have much going for it, I still somehow managed to draw some enjoyment out of it. I wouldn't recommend this show to anyone, which is most likely because anyone who would like this show has probably already heard about it or watched it by now.\\n",

            "content": "Love Live! School Idol Project, I believe, is a very good anime that expresses character development very well.\r\nAlthough the plot is very simple and bounds around ' saving the school' and Love Live! School Idol Project is often criticised because it is only focused on the subject of idols, it has a fantastic art style and it has a beautiful soundtrack, so even though it has such an easy plot, it is able to express the feelings of each and every of the 9 characters, which I think is fantastic because a lot of anime series that are popular nowadays do not really build upthe characters even if it's just the main character, but Love Live! School Idol Project is absolutely smooth with that and is able to build not one character, but the 9 main characters in the show.\\n\\n\r\nLove Live! School Idol Project is focused not necessarily on being an idol, but moreover the challenges that one faces and how to overcome them with the help of others. The 9 protagonists go through a series of events that tightens their bond, and eventually they part ways. Love Live! School Idol Project is a generally happy story, but it may just tear your heart when they decide to go their separate ways, because you may get so attached to the characters.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, this is a very heartbreaking anime for me, and I don't even know why. Normally, even anime like Clannad can't get to me, or even the famous Shigatsu Wa Kimi No Uso. Therefore, I truly believe that if you are a huge fan of the 'Slice of Life' genre, you should definitely put this on your watchlist.",

            "content": "I honestly didn't think I was going to like Love Live! School Idol Project. I first heard about it at Anime Expo last year. When I learned of the story, I thought it seemed incredibly stupid and a waste of time. But man.... this is one of the best anime series I've come across in awhile. \r\nThe story here is not anything to write home about. In fact, on the surface, it's kind of stupid. It's about a group of girls who form an idol group to raise awareness of their school. If they don't succeed, the school shuts down. The fact of the matteris that the story is only there to provide a highway for the more important themes of the show to ride on. \\n\\n\r\nBreathtakingly beautiful is how I would describe the animation here. Every single frame bursts with colors and creates a satisfying world for the characters to interact in. And these characters are animated quite well too, especially their eyes. The studio behind Love Live! School Idol Project is Sunrise. I'm not too familiar with them, but what they've done here is truly remarkable when the animation department. I would argue it's just as good, if not better, than what KyoAni puts out.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that I think is important to note is that this is not an anime where every episode contains a group of girls singing. There are about three songs in the anime, not including the OP and ED. These songs are quite nice. They're very reminiscent of AKB48. Some are almost identical to certain AKB48 songs. Not that I have a problem with that, but it's worthy to note. If you like AKB48, you'll like the music here. Same can be said about the OP and ED.\\n\\n\r\nI could write forever about the characters, but in particular I wanted to go into detail about Honoka Kousaka. She's the girl who starts the whole thing about wanting to save the school by forming an idol group. Her character is, pretty much, the leader of the rest of the girls. She is determined throughout the entire series to bring everyone together. She can be funny, but also emotional as well. Honoka is a very heartwarming character. She clearly cares about everyone. Everyone else has their ups and downs in the series. They grow and flourish like the best characters in anime.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as enjoyment, I had an amazing time with Love Live! School Idol Project. While the series is quite funny and upbeat, it also has a surprising amount of drama. In fact, I would argue that about half of Love Live! School Idol Project is dramatic, while the other half is filled with humor. I always think it's hard to create anything with both of these elements because one usually has more impact than the other. But not here. The show is able to balance the fun and more serious parts of the story as it goes along. I had moments when I laughed and others when I was teary eyed. I applaud Sunrise for being able to juggle both genres so well.\\n\\n\r\nLove Live! School Idol Project is one of the most beautiful stories I've watched in quite sometime. While the plot is not necessarily strong, the themes that the anime conveys are what truly shines. \\n\\n\r\nIt's about following your dreams and getting over obstacles - no matter how hard they may be. \\n\r\nIt's about friendship and staying true to your friends through the bad and the good. \\n\r\nMost of all, it's about life, and the ups and downs that come with it.",

            "content": "First of all, I thought this anime was going to be moe trash and had low expectations, I was wrong.\r\nStory 7\\10\r\nFor a slice of life there is an actual story that the characters make actual progress in instead of it just being introduced in the first couple of episodes not to be touched again later. These girls want to save the school they love in the way they want to which is to become an idol to attract people. The whole story is relevant throughout the entire season and 2 but I will keep this to season 1.\r\nArt 7\\10\r\nLooks like the moe cuteness that everyoneis sick of and it is do not get me wrong, but they really made this product well and I cannot say it ever lacked in quality. Everything for the most part looked smooth and natural. The problem I have is during the dancing they change the animation completely and while its cool to look at something different, its choppy.\\n\r\nSound 7\\10\\n\r\nAlright so right off the bat, I have to say the opening is not the best and for a musical oriented anime thats key to have. Luckily the songs they learn and perform throughout the 13 episodes make up for that and are pretty good. I have to say start dash is really one of the best in the entire series as a whole but you hear it early on and its awesome. My other favorite for those who want to know is A-rise dancing in season 2. As in all my reviews, I say music is subjective but if your not too much into idol music you can still find a track thats awesome I for one am not too much into idols but I really liked the songs.\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nnico nico go fuck yourself, LMFAO jk but the nico memes made this anime more popular. There are a total of nine girls in muses(the idol group) that have their own backstorys and character development throughout the series. Overall some are clishe or annoying and I do not mean nico memes aside I really liked that character. You could find lots of love for some of the characters and some are most are fleshed out very well throughout the series. \\n\r\nOverall 7\\10\\n\r\nNOTES that are important is that season 2 in most peoples opinion is better so if you invest time in this and overall like it than season 2 holds up to your standards plus more. The anime had some consistency problems through the entire series but was nothing too bad. Last thing I would say is that I review animes a bit harsher so if you see this 7 out of ten, you will most likely see lots of eights or nines. I a just not big into series like this but even I enjoyed this and would say its a good watch that you can even watch slowly(I binged a couple episodes every couple of days while I was watching). I would say give this a shot pretty enjoyable but nothing super groundbreaking.\\n",

            "content": "If you haven\u2019t been living under a rock you\u2019ve probably heard of Love Live!. It\u2019s one of the most popular anime in Japan and for good reason: it has idols and yuri, a great art style, and a story that perfectly caters to the otaku fandom. It\u2019s not quite as popular among a younger female audience as it is among an older male audience, but Sunrise already has Aikatsu for young girls so Love Live! is essentially the late night version of that. This anime has a lot of mixed opinions which is reasonable since anyone outside of the targeted audience isn\u2019t going to seethe appeal, but there are enough people in the targeted audience that it\u2019s a perfect anime for a lot of people. The very fact that it is so popular can also be a draw for some people since it has a lot of good memes, fan art, and other media that is all translated for the most part. I will talk about the story first. This is a show about girls who become idols to save their school. It\u2019s really quite similar to Girls und Panzer in that regard, but with the opposite reaction from the teachers. Honoka is confident that becoming idols would save their school while everyone else is skeptical, and rightfully so. After all, not only is not reasonable to expect to become popular simply from trying something you see other people getting popular from, as anyone who has tried created any kind of entertainment would know, but even if they did become popular that doesn\u2019t exactly guarantee that their school would be along for the ride as well. Despite how improbable that would be, these are our protagonists and Sunrise isn\u2019t going to show us some random idol group who failed to do what they sought to do. That would be boring. Naturally this is a success story and considering the way it\u2019s set up this isn\u2019t even really a spoiler. What is a spoiler is the opening theme song animation since it shows all nine of them dancing together which is the entire plot of the first season. It\u2019s a cast building so it starts with an incomplete cast and collects them as they go along so it\u2019s a spoiler which girls end up in the group. My next topic will be the art. The art looks very shiny and sort of 3D like which makes it perfect to make accurate anime figures of but it isn\u2019t so 3D that it would give the cringy 3D CGI effect. There was certainly a lot of CGI used in this anime, especially in the dance scenes, but while the dance scenes themselves don\u2019t look the best the rest of it looks very pretty. It\u2019s too detailed to be drawn by hand but they clearly didn\u2019t just leave everything up to the computers. When you ignore the hair and eye colours as well as the hair styles their faces are all very similar, but they do have some things to make them distinct. One important part of the character arcs of two characters who I won\u2019t name for sake of avoiding spoilers is gaining weight and then having to lose that weight, which wouldn\u2019t have been as nice to watch if the character designs weren\u2019t so good. The problem with their weight was the fact that they wouldn\u2019t be as mobile on stage so the fact that they still looked attractive in their overweight forms wasn\u2019t a problem in my eyes. Not completely art related, but they have a lot of great moments they designed like Nico Nico Nii which this whole review is designed to look like, if you hadn\u2019t noticed. The clothing designs were really well done. The skirts were very much on the short side and Sunrise didn\u2019t have the \u201cidol school\u201d excuse like they did with Aikatsu, but this isn\u2019t exactly unrealistic since most Japanese girls do tend to roll their skirts up. The outfits they use for their performances always fit the song and dance well and are always always very pretty. The music videos that serve to be part of the franchise are also very well drawn and designed, especially the later ones. The next section is the sound, which was definitely one of the anime\u2019s strong points. They hired Pile to play Maki for a reason, as she is a professional singer and has barely done any other voice acting. The songs are catchy and the singing is beautiful. In addition to the theme songs and insert songs being good the background music is also great. The voices are all good. They all fully embody their characters from Rin\u2019s nekomimi tomboy persona to Nico\u2019s eccentric fake cutey personality. The dub\u2019s voice actors are not as good to say the least, but if you actually care about watching this anime to get out of it what you should be coming for then I\u2019ll assume you\u2019re not watching the dub. While the voice acting is obviously not masterpiece quality and the music is fairly standard for the idol genre, it is all above average for slice of life anime. I will be talking about the characters next. As an idol anime it naturally has a large cast and since it introduces them one at a time it does give them all appropriate development despite not being super long. This does a lot better of a job characterizing all of its characters than The iDOLM@STER does despite being the same length and having around as big of a cast. All of the characters have distinct and interesting personalities and it doesn\u2019t feel like they\u2019re just exposition dumping their personalities on the viewers. They\u2019re shown in natural situations and are given the time to develop properly. Despite the fact that the anime wasn\u2019t that long, by the end of it you do get to really feel for the characters, provided you have the correct taste to enjoy it. Obviously as idols they aren\u2019t allowed to have hetero love, but we still do see some of the other kind which is beautiful. A lot of the characters have good chemistry together. Even less important characters like Honoka\u2019s younger sister and her friend are good characters despite not getting enough screen time to be as interesting as the main characters. The characters each cater to their own fans which both part of the reason why it\u2019s so popular and also part of the reason why people argue so much about who the best one is. Best girl is subjective in any series, but in this anime they are all equally well developed characters but are made for different people so it\u2019s even more subjective than usual. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find at least one character who you really like from the main characters, which is one of the benefits of there being nine of them and them all being very different. As much as everything sort of contributes to enjoyment, it can come from sources other than the previous four so it gets its own category. I got a lot of enjoyment from everything the show had to offer. I watched it on Crunchyroll without a membership so having watch through two minutes of commercials every episode slightly hindered my enjoyment of it in that way, but that isn\u2019t the anime\u2019s fault. Thankfully I saw this anime earlier on and didn\u2019t have the well poisoned for me. A lot of people say bad things about this anime, which is allowed under free speech, but it still is something that can ruin anime for people since you might go in looking for things to hate. I thoroughly enjoyed this anime when I watched it and nothing about it bored me in any way. A lot of my enjoyment of the franchise doesn\u2019t come from the anime itself and instead from the manga, the songs, and the fanart, but those I all enjoyed a lot more because I saw the anime. Fanbases can affect how much I like an anime and although some of the fans of this do go a bit too far overall they\u2019re good people and it feels nice to be part of something bigger. I\u2019m glad at least one anime about cute girls doing cute things has this devoted of a fanbase. In conclusion I thought this was a really good anime. It certainly deserves its popularity and even if the biggest mark of success for the creators was making it making it very accessible for the otaku community to latch onto I\u2019d consider that to be good enough. Objectively or subjectively it\u2019s obviously doing its job well and for that I congratulate it. I wouldn\u2019t consider it to be the best anime I\u2019ve seen or close to it, but it was certainly one of the most enjoyable. Whether if you like music anime, if you\u2019re already into the idol genre, or just like to argue with other people about who the best girl in an anime is this is a great choice.\\n",

The story isn't very deep or layered, and the characters are almost hilariously one dimensional. So what is it with Love Live! that makes me accept flaws I normally wouldn't?\r\nThe answer is escapism. Love Live! succeeds in giving the viewer escapism in it's purest form. This is also the reason why I enjoyed the show, even though (on paper) I shouldn't have. In his 1990 paper \"The Rationality of Escapism and Self-Deception\" John L. Longeway describes escapism as thus: \"... escapism borders on the neurotic,and is generally regarded as irrational\". In other words, I like the show not because it is good, but because I want to like it. The reason why the show's flaws doesn't bother me, is because I allow myself to become completely emerged into the world of the show; thereby leaving my normal life, and normal requirement of quality, behind.\\n\\n\r\nLongeway also writes: \"Escapist entertainment's essential purpose is to draw us away from our everyday troubles ...\" And this is the reason Love Live! works so well. There are no real stakes (no evil villain, no realistic portrayal of pessimism), instead we're introduced to a world where all the problems in the universe can be solved by song and happiness. It's basically a drug. Just like a stoner smokes pot to calm down and escape his mondaine reality, I watch Love Live! And who can judge anything honestly while being high?\\n\\n\r\nSo during the time I watch an episode of Love Live! Hitler didn't kill any jews, and the world economy isn't fucking shit; simply because of the absurd level of escapism this show injects me with.",

Every season it seems like most of the anime being released are just a bunch of Moe anime's. I have nothing wrong with Moe and I have to agree this anime was pretty good.\r\nIn terms of story it was prettydecent, it was one of the anime's to start this whole \"School Idols\" working towards their goals trend that everyone seems to not be able to get enough, it's a pretty common genre at this point but for it's time it was pretty interesting and not something you saw all that much, granted there were some around they were not as nearly as popular, this is one of the first to really become a mainstream anime. \\n\\n\r\nWhere this anime really shines is the \"Moe\" aspect of this \"Moe\" anime, remember that sentence I stated at the start? \"Cute girls doing cute things.\" well this anime does this REALLY well, all the characters are extremely cute and lovable in their own ways and there is so many different types of girls i'm sure at least ONE will become your waifu... All the girls are so lovable and well most of the scenes were pretty generic for a moe anime, it was the chatacter's in this show that make it so lovable... I often see everyone fighting over who the \"Top Tier Waifu\" of this in this anime is but to be honest they're all amazing characters. They all seem to have their own personality's and you can't help but love watching them grow and reach their goals.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like Moe School Idol anime's than you'll love this anime, just be careful when talking about your waifu as elitists love to try and argue why their waifu is the best waifu...

The first couple of episodes made both the characters and the plot appear rather immature and unlikeable, but thankfully that quickly changed as the story developed. \r\nThe main reason I decided to stick with this show \"'til the end\", however, was undoubtedly the art. With such a beautiful color palette and character design, it's impossible to look away from it. (In fact they could have probably been talking about potatoes for 13 episodes and I would still have watched it just for the pretty art). \r\nTheanimation is also very fluid and enjoyable, with the exception of the CG dance sequences, which would really throw me off every single time they were used. Instead of an anime, they reminded me of a vocaloid music video (which usually come from games like Project Diva) which was rather off-putting. Well, at least the characters still looked pretty. Kind of. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough the OST of this show is not particularly outstanding and presumably caters to the music tastes of prepubescent girls, it gets the job done by making the girls look cute and cheerful during their performances. Just as the plot itself, this OST is neither the best nor the worst, but falls somewhere in the middle (and somehow still manages to make this anime extremely entertaining). \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would definitely recommend this show to anyone who loves anime. If you think that idols, schoolgirls and teen drama are not your thing, then watch Love Live! School Idol project, and you may soon be pleasantly surprised.",

            "content": "From the studio that brought you Code Geass and Gintama (2006), the studio has now switched gears to bring us an adorable, \"too much moe\" and too much Nico-Ni, Nico Ni!, school idol show Love Live! When I first picked up this show, I wasn't expecting to enjoy it that much but surprisingly, I did.   \r\n[Story]\r\nOtonokizaka High school is set to shut down in three years due to lack of students enrolling in the school. Honoka Kosoka, a 2nd year high school student, decided to form a school idol group called \u00b5's (pronounced \"Muse\") to spread the school's reputation and keep it fromshutting down.  \\n\\n\r\nEver since the huge popularity of K-On!, many studios have tried to create a similar slice-of-life show to try and garner the same amount of fanbase K-On! got. I mean, who wouldn't? Studios want that money and now Sunrise successfully created the next K-On!. They are now raking in way too much money because of Love Live! They have so much money that they don't even know where to spend it on. \\n\\n\r\nI'm not really a big fan of idol groups. I don't and will never follow Japanese idol groups and I have never been obsessed with idols one bit. So...why do I love this show so much? I mean, I watched a whole bunch of slice-of-life shows but this one really stick-ed out. Here's my answer. K-On! will always be the best slice-of-life show out there and other slice-of-life shows doesn't even come close to K-On!'s quality. However, Love Live! is pretty close. When I first watched a few episodes of Love Live!, it gave me a K-On vibe which is a rarity. Simple plot, interesting/lovable/hilarious characters and last but not least..Music. Finally, a good slice-of-life show with actual music....just after K-On! \\n\\n\r\nThe story is fairly simple..The high school is set to shut down and Honoka decided to form a school idol group to try and save the school from shutting down. No surprise, she successfully saves the school from shutting down. The plot isn't really the best and you can say it's a bit laughable but then again, when it comes to slice-of-life show, I don't focus on the plot...at all! I'm supposed to pick up a slice-of-life show and just relax while watching it. This only happens when my brain is so stressed. \\n\\n\r\nOne last point that I want to talk about is even though this is a slice-of-life show, there will be dramatic moments in the show. There will be points in the show where a character, the characters, or an idol will face an obstacle that they have to deal with. Since I'm only limited on what I can talk about in terms of story, most of my review will be on the \"Sound\" and \"Characters\" category   \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: (8/10)\\n\r\nThe character design is actually the reason why I decided to just skip the show when I first noticed it. The anime industry right now is full of moe girls so I figured this show would be uninteresting and would just be full of moe girls doing absolutely nothing. Well, K-On! is full of moe girls doing absolutely nothing but that's different. The character design in this show is just too moe-ish. Big glaring eyes and cute high school girls definitely makes a great combination that will shit out the word \"moe\". Character designs aside, I like the overall animation and background design. It's definitely better than most slice-of-life shows with cheap animation. \\n\\n\r\nThe only issue I have and by issue, I mean major issue that can't be easily ignored is the use of CGi animation when the idol groups are having a performance. The use of CGi really sticks out and when you look at them, they look so lifeless and emotionless. Besides, using CGi characters on a 2D Animation doesn't really fit sometimes. I actually have no problem with the use of CGi but they have to make it blend with the 2D Animation...just like ufotable\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Sound]: (9/10)\\n\r\nRule number one of creating musical anime show is to have good music. Fortunately, the show followed that rule. Though, that doesn't mean that all of the music that Love Live! offered were great. Some of the music were decent and ok but none of the songs were bad. The best song in Season 1, in my opinion, is \"START:DASH\". I am absolutely in love with that song right now. Now the OP and ED theme song(s)\\n\\n\r\nThe OP theme song is Bokura wa Ima no Naka de\" by \u00b5's and the ED theme songs are \"Susume Tomorrow\" by \u00b5's and \"Kitto Seishun ga Kikoeru\" by the members of \u00b5's. The OP theme song is decent and I ended up skipping it by the 4th episode. The ED theme songs, on the hand, are great. I really wish the 1st ED theme song is the official one. Don't get me wrong, I also love the 2nd ED theme song but I love the 1st one more and I think it should have been used throughout the show. \\n\\n\r\nI watched the show in English Dub so I'll be reviewing the English VA's (Voice Actors). When I first heard that Love Live has gotten an English Dub, I thought it would flop real hard since this is a musical show and dubbing Japanese music would just ruin the show. Here's what they did though, they kept the Japanese music intact and they only dubbed the characters when they're talking. I know how the characters sound in both versions and their voices are surprisingly close to each other. Especially Kotori and Honoka's English VA. Kotori's English VA \"Christina Vee\" really surprised me because if you heard her other roles, you would be expecting her to voice Umi since her voice fits her character perfectly but she managed to do a high pitch voice for Kotori and it was amazing. Honoka's English VA right now is the reason why I love Honoka's character. Her VA managed to capture the energetic personality that Honoka has. I can even say that I like Honoka's English VA way more than the Japanese Voice Actress.  \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Characters]: (8/10)\\n\r\nThe show has a large cast of characters so don't expect all the main characters to be developed. Honoka, Kotori, and Umi do get some development but don't expect all of the character developments to come until Season 2. For this review, I won't talk about it. Now I'll talk about the 9 main characters...This will be a long one. \\n\\n\r\nThe main protagonist of the series is Honoka Kosaka. A ditzy, airhead, super-energetic, very careless and stubborn high school girl who eats a lot of snacks. Whoever created Honoka's character really knows how to cater to the fanbase because her personalities are almost every man's dream. I gotta admit though, Honoka is my favourite character in the series because of her personalities and the fact that she doesn't give up and will do anything to achieve her dream of becoming a school idol. I did mention that her English VA is also another reason why I liked Honoka's character right? Then there's Umi Sonoda. A character whose personality is very similar to Mio from K-On! If you know Mio then it wouldn't take you a second to figure out that Umi is also a shy high school girl but has that leader-type personality. A kind of girl you can depend on. Then there's Kotori Minami, a very cute girl with a very (high-pitched) cute voice in both versions of the show. \\n\\n\r\nThen there's Rin who's so similar to Honoka in terms of personality and almost always adds a \"nya\" at the end of her conversation. Sorry Rin, I still like Honoka better even though I find your \"Neko\" (Cat) personality very cute. Then there's Maki, a rich, somewhat shy girl and a cute tsundere girl. Honestly, I love Maki when she goes \"tsundere\" mode which are also the exact same reasons why I love tsundere girls. Then there's Hanayo, a calm, innocent shy girl with an obsessive idol otaku type on the inside. Then there's Eli Ayase, a student council president and the Senpai of the group. At first, I kinda hated her but as the show progressed, I grew to like her character. Then there's Nozomi Toujou, a big-breasted girl who constantly threatens other girls to fondle their breasts if they don't do what they're supposed to do. She also has a set of cards that can somehow predict the future and she's also the one who came up with the clever name for their idol group. Last but not least is Nico-Nico Nii! A girl who will touch your heart with her Nico Nico-Smile! I have seen countless cute catchphrases in my 1 year of watching anime and this is definitively going into my Top 5 cute catchphrases. Her catchphrase does get annoying when she constantly uses it. Speaking of catchphrases, Nico Yazawa is a 3rd year high school. That's right...3rd year..I didn't believe it at first either because I thought she was a first year based on her appearance (which highly resembles Azusa from K-On!) and personality. Hell, I thought Maki was a 2nd or 3rd year at first because she's the most mature character in the group. \\n\\n\r\nIf you look at the cast of main characters, you'll notice that they all have generic personalities that we all have seen before. I mean, there's a tsundere, a shy girl, an energetic girl, and etc. Out of the 9 characters in the show, you'll like at least one of them for sure. Yes, they all have generic personalities made to cater to the fanbase but the characters are going to be more than a \"generic character\" in the 2nd Season which I won't talk about here. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]: (9/10)\\n\r\nI've watched tons of slice-of-life shows out there and this anime, for sure, came close to K-On!'s quality. When I first watched the first 3 episodes, I knew I found the next K-On! and after I finished the series, it definitely gave me a K-On! vibe. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[VERDICT]\\n\r\n\"Love Live! School Idol Project\" is an amazing slice-of-life anime that focuses on the girls working to become a school idol. It has a decent to great music quality and an interesting cast of characters that are hilarious and lovable. I also love the character interactions. If you're a big fan of slice-of-life shows or school idol animes then this anime is a must watch. \\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]: (8.3/10)\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Simple Plot\\n\r\n+Tons of Funny Moments\\n\r\n+Great Slice-of-Life/School Idol Anime\\n\r\n+Great Music\\n\r\n+Great ED theme song\\n\r\n+Interesting cast of Characters that are hilarious and lovable\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Constant use of CGI in the OP and idol performances",

This was literally what my friend told me when I asked them about Love Live!\r\n\"Dude the anime is full of fan service with no plot but if you must watch it just watch it for the girls\"\r\nBack then I never heard of idol animes before and I was curious. So I tuned in to this anime expecting a plotless show with dancing and girls flaunting their bodies. Boy was I wrong.\r\nAfter completing both seasons I was surprised at how sad I was to see this show go.To start its a complete opposite of everything my friend told me. The story was mediocre but nice. The power of friendship is strong in this anime. I enjoyed listening to the songs. And the different personalities of each character is both funny and entertaining to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOnly problems you might have with this show is:\\n\r\n1)This is a full female cast anime. Zero male roles. Even supporting characters are all female. If you can't handle the lack masculinity then sorry for you. \\n\r\n2)The dancing is ok but its abit off putting because the art style is changed to 3D.\\n\r\n3)Expecting Hatsune Miku to appear in the 3D scenes (No she doesn't appear, shes not even related to this anime)\\n\\n\r\nIf you can overcome all that then this show is worth a watch.",

            "content": "Now, I've never been much of a fan for Idol games, and honestly I came into watching the anime due to a friend wanting me to play the iPhone game, and my liking of the outfits.\r\nI never found the appeal of animes like idolm@ster, Aikatsu, K-on, and the like. I've never been that big about slice of life. Out of the three other anime's I mentioned, I tried out K-On and didn't much care for it. And hearing about Love Live at first I just turned a blind eye to it.\r\nBut then I watched it. First off what's so great is that the main charactersdidn't wish to form a group out of a desire to be famous or out of sheer boredom. They did it with a clear goal to save the school (Except for Nico but that's part of Nico's charm) Each character has an individual reason to want to save the school and an individual way that gets them to join the group. \\n\\n\r\nThey're not there to just get famous and popular and thats a huge part of why I enjoyed the story and kept along with it. But also... the characters. They've all got refreshing personality to them on top of great design. Nico and Kotori are my personal favorites, mostly because Nico's a huge trope on the typical snobby idol that everyone turns a blind eye too or even make fun of on top of her catchy Nico nico niii. Kotori's one of the few moe blob characters that are so sickeningly sweet that I want to hold forever, and near the end what she had to decide on wrenched my heart.\\n\\n\r\nI think the animation in this anime is superb. I just love the way the characters look in general, something about their anime design is just great to look at, fluid, and precious. It's one of the few anime i've oogled at and muttered to myself \"I love how the characters look.\" That said, I'm not too fond of the style they used in dance sequences, if you've watched the anime you should know what i'm talking about. I hadn't looked into it, but it looks more like game models to me. And if done right that'd be great (Like Show by Rock!!'s mumon sequences) But something about the dance sequences (Barring than the flashes to the anime's usual beautiful animation) It looks a bit lifeless and tacky.\\n\\n\r\nSound is a mixed bag and I'm sure just like everything songs I dislike others will love. Personally I really loved A-RISE's song, it was really catchy and I could see why they have so many fans. A lot of the inserts for u's on the other hand were really simple and a bit kidlike for the most part. But I believe that was more the anime's way of getting across that, yes, they're amateurs. And their quality does get better over time. (Especially if you play the iphone game, there's a ton of songs done by the group outside of the anime that is HANDS  DOWN GREAT like Anemone Heart or Mermaid Festa) \\n\r\nWhat I especially liked was how the ending theme was done. Whoever was a large focus for that episode, typically gets to do a solo of the theme song. It was very cool of them to do that, and interesting to see how each character sang the same song differently.\\n\\n\r\nIn general the anime was barrels of fun for me. I came in not expecting much, but especially near the end the drama they had to deal with was heart wrenching. I never thought an idol anime of all things could wound me like that. It has it's serious moments, and it makes you come to love the time they spend together happily even more. It was great watching them struggle to save the school, and I fondly recommend it to anyone. It's not just an idol anime. It's not even the main focus in my opinion. It's about the main characters becoming friends and their struggles to reach their goal.",

            "content": "Perhaps slight spoilers ahead? \r\nLove Live! School Idol Project. I had originally discovered the series through the phone app, Love Live! I thought it was cute and I had especially liked Nico. I got the game, played it a bit, and fell in love with the game instantly. I had no idea it was an anime, or manga, or a real thing outside of the phone game.\r\nOn a whim, I decided to Google it for any tips on getting nicer cards in the game, when I found the anime on Crunchyroll!\r\nI binge-watched over the Summer, instantly falling in love with the characters. The anime openswith Honoka Kousaka, second year at Otonokizaka High, learning that her school will shut down. Not wanting her 'precious high school life' to be destroyed, Honoka seeks answers in how to save her school.\\n\\n\r\nAs she heads home, she finds her sister lying next to a pamphlet about UTX High, the most popular high school in their area. Honoka confronts Yukiho, and Yukiho tells her that everyone's saying that there's no point in enrolling to Otonokizaka, since it's going to be shut down.\\n\\n\r\nThe next morning, Honoka heads to UTX High, only to be welcomed by a school idol group, A-RISE! They're the most popular school idols, which causes their high school to be the most popular. Honoka gets an idea, which basically starts the whole show!\\n\\n\r\nAs the story progresses, Honoka, along with her friends Umi Sonoda and Kotori Minami meet many amazing girls, getting new friends and doing what they love.\\n\\n\r\nThe characterization is superb- each girl had an episode dedicated to her and her backstory, why she is the way she is, etc. \\n\\n\r\nFor the music, I loved each song, particularly Happy Maker!, Music S.T.A.R.T, Aishiteru Banzai, and others.  \\n\\n\r\nThe visuals were also nice, very aesthetically pleasing and clean. \\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for an anime to binge-watch over the Summer, I recommend Love Live! School Idol Project. It's cute, it's music is amazing, and you'll fall in love with the amazing protagonists.",

Then I saw many people recommend this, Love Live! is truly amazing and re-establishes the importance of Idol genre in Anime. However, In my opinion I don't think it is better than iDOLM@STER...yes it has better art, but the depth and connection you had between the characters in iDOLM@STER was a bit more prominent than in Love Live! AndLove Live was short...IMO that is.\\n",

            "content": "By looking at the cover of Love Live! it pretty much looks like a show targeted towards guys about 'cute girls doing cute things'. But in no way should you judge a book by it's cover so is this show really what it looks like?\r\nStory (7):\r\nSo, the concept of Love Live! is pretty nice. Honoka who loves her school wants to stop it from closing down by starting a School Idol group. It is straightforward and it should provide much material for the story to progress. It should have, but it didn't. This show was practically just filler episode after filler episode with notmuch progression of the actual story and many repetitive scenes. As well as that, there were many plot holes. Some of the serious scenes were over-dramatized and all in all the first season just didn't get anywhere. \\n\\n\r\nArt (9):\\n\r\nOne of the great things about Love Live! is the beautiful art from Sunrise. The art was consistent and had a lovely art style. There was minimal use of CGI, the only scenes that used it were the live performances, and for CGI it was very well done. Most of the character designs were memorable and unique. Overall the art is probably my favorite thing about the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (6):\\n\r\nThe characters were....well cute girls all with very different personalities, and by 'different personalities' I mean a bunch of different stereotypes. For a start Honoka, our heroine, who in a few words is: dumb, energetic, forgetful and cheerful. Just what you would expect from a 'cute girls doing cute things anime'. The rest of the characters were pretty much the same, a simple, stereotyped personality with no real back story and no development. \\n\\n\r\nSound (8):\\n\r\nConsidering this is an idol anime, you would expect great, idol music. And that is exactly what we got from Love Live! The music was well suited to the show and the OP and ED had nice animation sequences. Unfortunately I found that the voice acting was not the best, in my opinion Minami and Honoka's voices were just plain annoying and the rest of the voice acting wasn't much better.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7):\\n\r\nOverall, Love Live! really did not live up to my expectations, but if you do want an anime that you can just sit back and watch without really having to think about it, this is that type of anime.",

            "content": "Before proceeding, I'd like to say that I've always thought that all the idol group type of anime were where people came up with a diverse cast of characters with the sole purpose of appealing to as many people as possible. In the process of doing so, they would assign a popular archetype to each character and stick to it, creating one-dimensional characters. As long as each character played their archetype correctly, they hope to sell the songs; using the anime as something of an advertisement. With this belief that companies wouldn't mind haphazardly putting their intellectual property on as many mediums as possible forpromotion (as with a number of Live Action, Anime, Manga adaptions), I consciously avoided idol group type anime.\\n\\n\r\nWith that said,\\n\\n\r\nLove Live was actually very entertaining with a few emotional turns. The main-est of the main characters, Honoka, was refreshing to watch and rather than being just a fully happy character for no reason, there is background to it. Her enthusiasm serves a very important role in driving the story forward. The other characters, though all motivated for different reasons, were ultimately pushed to join the group because of Honoka's energy, determination and earnest.\\n\\n\r\nEach main character is given sufficient screen time to properly show more than just their surface personalities. You don't get to see very far into their background outside of the initial trio but every character gets development.\\n\r\nThe second last episode was especially great as it resonated with me personally. And the last episode was, well, fitting. Despite having mostly predicted it, it had a happy kind of emotional impact.\\n\\n\r\nPacing was good. Background music was background music (I kinda liked the sad one). The songs were good, especially with lyrics. Or rather, it doesn't have impact without the lyrics. The songs weren't initially to my tastes but the lyrics fit the moment so well, I ended up liking them regardless.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's great. Would recommend.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\n(Also, I think the reason my thoughts on Love Live is this comprehensive is because it subverted a long held belief that idol group anime can't be good)",

The very first seconds of this show put a big smile on my face and it stuck all the way through. \r\nThe story contains a lot of cliches, but it is so well directed that they don't really matter. The pacing is a masterpiece that allows for drama, comedy, \"girl of the week\", some degree of actual character depth and slice of life in the mere 13 episodes, without feeling rushed or crammed. This is the only show other than AIR that has managed to pull off something like this in such a compact format. The only complaint I can comeup with regarding the story is that the second half contains a couple of wierd twists that didn't feel entirelly waterproof.\\n\\n\r\nThere are quit a few characters that are all likeable in their own ways. Perhaps the story could have been even more fleshed out with a somewhat smaller cast, but as it is, everyone fits in nicely enough due to the great directing.\\n\\n\r\nGraphics-wise, the standard is set unusually high for a high school anime, but the animation during the live performances and OP/ED is mindblowingly well crafted with smooth, vivid and realistic CGI movement that actually doesn't clash with the traditional 2D graphics. Very well done.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound score is hard to set objectively, since even if the songs themselves might be mediocre at times, they absolutely are the climaxes of the show when bundled with the awesome performance animations. So as a part of the whole package, the sound gets a 9, even though ther are only a couple of songs I would actually bother to put in my \"good shit\" mp3 folder.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Love Live sets a new standard for innocent feel-good anime. It is a great piece of both craftsmanship and art.",

The cheerful characters, sometimes silly situations, songs that are performed by the characters... Heck, even the intro and outro are catchy and that's what I think makes this show quite memorable. Yes, the animations are sometimesa bid wanky (mostly when they animate the dances, the cars are renderedat a low frame rate), but overall is good.

            "content": "The bizarre slew of opinions of regarding this wildly popular show has always fascinated me. From those who praise the show for a simplistic but well-cast plethora of characters from all walks of life, to those who will write it off as a moeblob, and even those who perceive it to be inferior to its much more popular counterpart, The iDOLM@STER, it's just odd to see that even those who adore this graceful work of art don't attempt to unravel what Sakurako Kimino is trying to say.\r\nTo be blunt, these interpretations completely miss the point of this show, though I can't fault anyone for doingso, as this is marketed in a way that is seemingly misses its niche, which I'll explain later. At its very core Love Live! School Idol Project is a psychological study on the precepts of emotionalism versus rationalism, an exploration of what causes the barrier of pseudo-intellectual mindset to shatter upon nearing adolescence, a critique on the reality TV fetish in first world countries, a scathing indictment on the argumentative comfort of laurel-based rhetoric, an analysis on the lack of inherent value in the exonerative blame-game played amongst acquaintances, a thought-provoking work that questions what it means to be a leader, a marvelously-crafted excursion into the process of self-denial, and most of all: a commentary on how a unanimous goal brings people together, and what happens when they become too defined by their faith. And that's not even a complete list. \\n\\n\r\nBefore I divulge into my analysis of this show's staggering tapestry of themes, I have to do away with some of my personal preconceptions of what I was to take of this show. If you don't want to hear my previously unfounded stance on the idol obsession, skip the next paragraph.\\n\\n\r\nBefore I viewed this show, I had thought that idol-based anime were of a breed inferior to even harems. The very idea that there's only girls running around a school, and that a striking number of Western anime fans, particularly the male ones, indulge in viewership of it, struck me as a more deplorable genre than harems. Because in harems, self-insertion is the key (unless it\u2019s Heaven\u2019s Lost Property, Tomoki is too damn hilarious to be reduced to an audience stand-in,) and with that, it to an extent, requires its audience to at least have a modicum of fantasizing and thought. However, with female-centric shows like this, the characters might just be too simple for girls to relate to, and for guys to fawn over for the said simplicity. It doesn\u2019t require any kind of thought from the audience whatsoever, which turned me off the the genre itself. If I had to be honest, I only watched this because of the meteoric ascent of fan-favorite girl Niko Yazawa. I thought it was gonna be about cute girls and that Nico would just be a fun character. And boy was I proven wrong. Although on the surface, the show does everything you expect it to, there is so much more going on beyond it. \\n\\n\r\nAnd without further ado, let's get right into the review!\\n\\n\r\nOn paper, the story works, and is as effective as it is simplistic. But you'd be hard-pressed to find an idea that doesn't work on paper, as the entire premise of outlining the gist of the story is to be synoptic and evaluate the principle, first, and the execution residing in its translation into audiovisual media. An example of failure in translation is the case of F. Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s unparalled classic novel, The Great Gatsby, which offers one of America\u2019s most beloved stories, yet is always rightfully panned in cinema form. Conversely, the case of Love Live! School Idol Project, falls nothing short of what it proposes.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike other shows of it's nature, Love Live is completely punctual with what it's overarching goal is. From the very first episode, there is as much intrigue as there is a straightforward execution. In comparison to K-On, for example, where Yui at first very vaguely seeks to join a club and just happens to stumble on the Light Music Club, Love Live! has our heroine, Honoka, preparing to shoot the moon from the start. Her school is on the decline due to a lack of enrollment, and she's ill-prepared to transfer, given her lack of study and academic aptitude. One could argue that K-On prides itself in subtlety (most likely Digibro,) whereas Love Live! spells out its fiery ambition from the start, and ironically, the latter argument would be the one that doesn't delve into the deeper implications.\\n\\n\r\nWhere the introduction truly distinguishes itself, is the fact that Honoka has to convince herself that she loves the school. Her and her compatriots, Umi and Kotori travel the school, finding tons of reasons why she has to stay and bring more people there. But there\u2019s the catch, she doesn\u2019t know why, she\u2019s just inept as a student. This self-induced delusion is a very human thing to do, and already sets the show off on good footing aside from the rest of what is on display. \\n\\n\r\nFrom there on out, the show follows a general pattern, they have a quick obstacle, then they get new members really fast, move forward, and are rarely impeded in their ascent until Honoka\u2019s illness. The other idol groups are rarely presented, as this is a character-centric narrative, similar to how Steins;Gate never really showed much of SERN or the future failure would entail (although that show is hindered in hindsight of that, because it's the opposite case.) One of the main criticisms of the show is that characters are elided into the group all too quickly, and aren\u2019t explored with proper depth. But this couldn\u2019t be further from the truth, as I\u2019ll explain with the character section below.\\n\\n\r\nFor the sake of the characters, I\u2019ll be delving into the more favorited trio, and only quickly describe in a more general stroke, as this section will be relatively lengthy. \\n\\n\r\nHonoka is defined more by her false atavism and reverence for the school. As I said before, her initial intrigue stems from the fact that she doesn\u2019t even know why she venerates the school. She\u2019s proceeds to ask her friends about what\u2019s good, what can lure people into the school in the first episode, providing implications into why she . Her naive yet cheerful attitude does so much to boost the entertainment value of the show, so much that you won\u2019t even realize that she is going too far, that her subtle selfishness is pre-meditated throughout the whole show. All the girls in the show rally around her ebullience and persistence to save their school. Her drive and optimism on their own make fans who enjoy her character smile and be easily coalesced into the very essence that makes her a protagonist, while her detractors will be overwrought with an unending smugness over the very failures that stem from it, prime example being when she went unconscious during a live performance on the school rooftop, due to the fact that she was exercising in the rain, during the wee hours of the morning, thus leaving her in a horrible condition. Her selfishness upon discovering that Kotori has to leave stems from this in a way that went over everyone\u2019s head: she had come this far, and her stupidity synthesizing with the arrogance that the faith that everyone bestows upon her, is a clear-cut reason for her otherwise irrational actions towards her. This event explores the pitfalls of faith, from her holding it toward her goal, as well as that of others placing it in her. But our protagonist is nothing in face of the real best girl, Umi.\\n\\n\r\nUmi Sodona is undoubtedly one of the most ingenious characters ever conceived. Most would misconstrue her thematic presence to write her off as pandering material due to her innate introversion, and it's not difficult to veer into as to why. The skeptical rhetoric she displays from the very beginning is a piece most idol fans will appreciate, and that coupled with her shyness and loyalty make for a well-rounded character for this type of show (traits of which I'll return to shortly.) But this is merely grazing the surface, one that does not represent the bigger picture any more than smugly proclaiming that George Orwell's 1984 is of no more value than a scathing indictment of the Soviet Union relative to its publication. The beloved Umi-chan is Sakurako Kimino's proxy in traversing the primordial Apollonian and Dionysian conflict. The temporality of contemporary society is no doubt the launchpad for her writing. From the very inception of Honoka's practically zealous proposition, Umi held it to scrutiny. Being faced with her childhood friend of all people, she gradually refrains from using her abundant rationale, as Kotori helps convinces her to stand with her friend's selfish desires via the fallacy of relative privation. Kotori argues that based on a lack of regrets as younger children underneath her wing, Umi should refrain from being so skeptical. Her concise yet thought-provoking loss of thought is similar to that of A Clockwork Orange. In that story, protagonist Alex chooses to submit his right to choose, but does it out of seeing it as an easy way out of prison. Umi, does it because of the faith-based delusions of her friends, the influence that causes internal ambivalence towards the idea, but never the people around her. But that already explains itself, those she's surrounded by, tug her away from the Apollonian, and into the Dionysian. This reinforces the theme of Apollonian self-denial that Maki and Eri also go through, whereas Niko has the same process through the emotional pattern, and that Nozomi, Rin, and Hanayo experience. The reassurance of lifelong friends, and their laurels is a subtle jab at western feminist culture in itself, given how one of their borderline dogmatic contentions is that any woman who opposes their cause is thriving off the achievement of the movement's past, and therefore should not be in opposition to it. And everything about this message is handled with profound subtlety and class, which is also the very crux that makes Umi a human character, despite having such an undertaking to deliver so many messages in the span of 13 episodes.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat makes this girl in particular stand out from her eight friends and peers, is that her mannerisms are portrayed in such a unique foil to her peers. She's shy, but nowhere near as much as Nanayo upon her introduction. She begins practical, but doesn't use it as an excuse to be as tsunderiffic as Maki's reluctance to join the group. She's got the qualities of a leader, but nowhere near the cocksure attitude of Nico. I could go on, but you get the picture. The one thing that she has that is shown in a truly humanistic portrayal is that of her insecurity. Whereas Eri blares over her insecurity with a collected attitude and infodumps her characterization to the audience, Umi goes around discussing matters in a way that implicates it, slowly allowing any categorization by way of the term, \u201cdandere,\u201d to exfoliate, and for the density of the script to show in all its glory. Her argument with Eri, during the same episode where her ballet past is revealed, is one of the most erroneously scripted pieces of dialogue I have heard. It's unfashionably easy to pick apart the flaws in both their mindsets. Umi shouldn't take to heart what someone thinks of a genre as a whole, but you can't blame her if you understand the prowess of her psychological shifts. It's a humanistic portrayal of how she's rising to her goal but losing her critical mindset at the same time. It's a beautiful moment in the series, one that goes massively overlooked. As the degradation of Umi's rhetoric spirals downward into cognitive biases and emotional decisions, her intellect is used sparingly on her friends as a reminder to is who she is. And this is the beauty of her character. The few strands of who she once was is still explored, from her lecture to Honoka on why what she did to Kotori was overdone, as well as using her athletic skills to coordinate drills for the girls. And yes, she is very cute, and is now on my sodomy list. Overall, Umi is quite the profound character, and a robust take on the dandere archetype that I won't soon forget.\\n\\n\r\nNiko Yazawa is a postmodern critique of the pseudo-intellectual sphere of the Internet. Every facet of her character can, and should be compared to that of users who squabble over opinions by projection and escapism that deludes one into convincing themselves that they are intellectually superior to others. Upon her arrival quite early into the show, she dons a rather tacked-on disguise,  and projects her personality as more credible by chiding every single chink in Honoka's ignorance. Niko's vitriol is furthered as she is seen commenting on the \u00b5s' first music video, stating that they are \"ten years too early to claim they're idols!\" She complements her rage-induced diatribe with the use of an emoticon, which is a clear allegory to the nature of forum users who will subconsciously allocate all their mental capacity to their eloquence, in order to simultaneously project themselves as the superior position without truly articulating any tangible points in their contrarian \"polemic.\" Given the meteoric ascent of atheism, the alt-right, and other ideological frameworks (or lack thereof, to give the former at least some credit) due to the impression they can leave on unironically contrarian high school students, it\u2019s easy to assume that Kimino sought to take a reactionary stance to ironically, the neo-reactionaries. \\n\\n\r\nNever before has a moe (Lain doesn\u2019t count) character ever been used as an allegory to the contemporary state of the Internet, tackle the issue of projection with depth, as well as serve as the show\u2019s memetic magnet, done in a practicable manner, and possibly never before if my memory serves me right.  Her slyly satiric portrayal of basement-dwelling projection is discomforting to audiences who aren\u2019t fawning over her inherent cuteness, but her alter ego(s) make her literally three-dimensional in nature. She runs around ruining \u00b5\u2019s practices, stealing food, disguising herself, hid her idol obsession, and fuels an alternative persona to compensate for the ugly nature she harbors. As we all know, she\u2019s self-centered and egotistical, but over time she becomes more and more acquainted with the group, but doesn\u2019t really do so, and stays humorous. The crux of this, is her controversial catchphrase, \u201cNico nico nii~.\u201d Some say it\u2019s just fanboy bait, while she\u2019s actually still a stuck-up bitch. I forward the proposition: Why does her being the latter make her a bad character? How boring would the group be if everyone was super nice? This show is supposed to layer humor and exuberance over the true nature of humanity, like Boogie Nights before it (although it was more straightforward, being that it is a film that had to make a statement.) Her projection as an alternative persona, a lovable little girl that all idol fans will love, and relying her knowledge to move up is showing us in the endless pursuit of opportunism, that all the well fails without moving with her group, as her moment of overthinking, and letting her hair down for the camera showed.\\n\\n\r\nThis mental dichotomy is further accentuated when factoring in the story behind her cultivated persona. For those of you that don\u2019t know, there\u2019s an anecdote her character has outside of the show that explains the affably lovable mantra, \u201cNico nico nii!\u201d I\u2019d advise all fans to read it if they haven\u2019t already, but for those who won\u2019t, the story boils down to her dad always doing it (purported to be affirmed in season 2 when her family is explored, but I haven\u2019t seen it yet.) This backstory adds yet another dimension to her already complex character. \\n\\n\r\nNozomi serves as a symbolic proxy of arguing how one can live happily in a predestined life, and serves as one who can be compared to ironically the unpredictable characters like Netero from Hunter x Hunter. The paradox of her character is to serve as a comedic relief character that simultaneously serves as manna for the severely misinterpreted doctrine of Calvinism. Calvinists and their subsidiaries, the Puritans offered pessimistic viewpoints often construed as pointless. Why live your life in any way if you\u2019re cynical of the world due to Puritan promotion of education, and you tote the belief that the end result of your life shall not change regardless of your actions? Nozomi consults her Tarot cards, which can be interpreted as a response to Tumblr\u2019s obsession with zodiac signs, but since she doesn\u2019t try to compartmentalize people in any way besides their breast size, I\u2019ll side with the notion that it\u2019s the aforementioned case regarding history\u2019s indifference to the truth behind predestination. She has fun, she spends lots of time with Eri, and has her moment of chronicling the lives of the members before they even attain a modicum of attention, and shatters any neutrality one might have against her with her comedic flavor of always fondling the breasts of her fellow idols. It\u2019s quite simple what to do when your lifestyle promotes pessimism as much as it promotes fates set in stone, you accept what you know has been destined, as Nozomi does when she checks her cards with a smile on her face. The way even the most pessimistic of intellectuals stayed alive is too keep pursuing knowledge, or sharing it with people. The role Nozomi plays in the narrative is similar to that of Jim Casy from The Grapes of Wrath. As for the the aforementioned chronicling, that episode made quite a devastating comment on the duplicitous nature of reality TV shows. No one in Keeping Up With The Kardashians talks about Kim\u2019s sumptuous encounters and releases with Ray J, just like no one recorded talks about how Nico has a secret idol backlog that no one in the entire school knew about. Seeing this from the perspective of high school students is harrowing. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest are easier to pin down, Maki is a tsundere that adds to Nico as well as serves as an interesting take on composition that makes modern audiences swoon over older styles of music, Eli is the only failure, as the abstract representations of her childhood were incomprehensible, then she literally delivered on exposition on her personality on Honoka that rendered the flashbacks useless, and were heavily-handed. Rin is underrated because she doesn\u2019t actually say \u201cnya\u201d to an annoying extent, and her childhood dilemma about being berated for trying to be feminine is supposed to evoke empathy from men who have the same issue, not women. Kotori represents the obscene conflict high school students have to undergo, constantly rethinking if she wants to pursue education, or her job, the latter being her practice in the end, as well as showing that the innate nervousness of breaking news to our friends no matter how many times we swear to do it, will always take a toll on us. \\n\\n\r\nThe presentation of this story is crafted so meticulously. Classic films like The Searchers and Taxi Driver give a view of the inside looking out at the world, Leo Tolstoy's sprawling magnum opus War and Peace shows the outside looking in at his gallery of characters. Love Live! accentuates its differences, as showing the dead center, looking around. Every vicissitude is expounded on greatly, as the directors consistently draw upon as much faith as the idols have to their success, only to masterfully dramatize every vicissitude relative to their predicaments. It's evocative of the way the Monogatari series is presented: everything focused upon during the screentime is given detail. Every new character that they stumble on is shown in more detail than a few background junkies dispersed throughout the screen. This is why Honoka always runs into the same three girls who support the idol club. This is why you only see women in the show. It's all a matter of perspective, and it wastes no time on developing the otaku haven, the municipality of Akibahara. Takahiko Kyogoku familiarizes you with the students, by allowing you a claustrophobic detail a la Martin Scorsese's 1973 film Mean Streets, without the perspective of New York, but with all the grandeur of their performances that project to the world.\\n\\n\r\nThe art, is one of the most subtle paradoxes the ever exist in this medium. Though the world is bleak, the vibrant, albeit generic color palette shines, with quite the self-awareness of its concomitant duplicity. It will deceive you greatly, but this is nary a facet of this show's presentation that doesn't serve a grander purpose. Juxtaposing well-drawn anime girls to allure a non-critical audience with a staggering amount of criticism, many exuding too much profundity and erudition for the people it criticizes to notice, is an underappreciated aspect of the story. The vibrant colors are aren\u2019t slathered over, it\u2019s all innocuous so that it becomes a subdued experience thematically, and hilariously dramatized in other departments.\\n\\n\r\nThe best part of the artistic flair is that of its camera angles. The impeccable usage of varying shots all give the girls a larger-than-life feel. The best way to describe this, is how much it resembles Stanley Kubrick's underrated triumph, Paths of Glory. As Kirk Douglas was portrayed with lower camera angles during his major monologues in the court case in the aforementioned film, every character is mostly portrayed from a lower or up-front angle in a similar matter. Every character exudes an aura of charisma, and evoke a larger-than-life feel that is worked in equal parts the impeccable script as it is by the marvelous camerawork. This method of looking up towards the characters makes them seem as big as they fall, as your perception is shattered time and time again, when our heroines are shown through the bleakest of times, from performing to an empty audience, to Honoka's illness taking a toll on her consciousness. The minute they are looked down upon, you feel the levity they do, due to the immaculate presentation. The abject horror Yukihiro Wantanabe, and Miho Sugiura can instill from every idol member and even the viewer is astounding in every sense of the word. \\n\\n\r\nAnother distinctive trait is the sparing yet effective usage of shaky cam. Expanding on aforementioned the \"harder-they-fall\" concept, a prime example of the dramatic camera ruptures is found upon the first time Eri trains the girls using ballet means, as it is effective in flexibility. As they all flail and struggle against their burning muscles, and the escalation of difficulty in their training regiments, Youhei Sasaki frames the scene at a skewed angle, slanted from below, and with a constant shaky movement of the camera. The swift animation of the idols fighting for the top spot is amplified by the way the scene is dramatized. The shaky effect makes it all that much more intense building up to the resounding failures, whether it be Honoka's rooftop collapse, or the aforementioned scene, wherein Rin is the first to collapse in her ballet stance. It's all-in-all a fantastic trick, grounded by fluid motion and not overdone in a nauseating velocity. \\n\\n\r\nMy only true complaint about this misinterpreted masterpiece is the abysmal CGI, something I think most of us can agree on. It\u2019s usage in the opening and performances stilts the transitions and runs at a slower framerate than the hand-drawn animation. \\n\\n\r\nAs for something one would usually think would be a selling point of this show, the music, to put it simply, is stale outside a few hit-or-miss songs like Start;Dash. The actual intro is different, as it\u2019s not the template that offers a few random shots of characters, rather it\u2019s just one overdone CGI crapfest. In my opinion, the actual song used would be better used as a next episode preview, rather than a way to open the show. Regardless, some people will like it, and others won\u2019t. Just know what you\u2019re getting into as the most important songs are going to be pop-oriented, and is only complemented by a generic soundtrack that does little but appropriate the mood of any given scene. If you abhor pop music in any matter, it shouldn\u2019t deter you too much as they are only brief respites from the messages in each episode, and aren\u2019t too insulting to those who consider their taste above generic pop. \\n\\n\r\nLastly, the conclusive note I'll instill into the few who have trudged through this merely synoptic overlook of this piece's dizzying social insights, is not that of a summative note. Rather, I'll go off on a tangent for what this means for the foreseeable future of this community. The severe misinterpretation of this show's meaning, is done in by those who came in expecting a simple idol story, or even a moe shitfest that will be burned at the stake by people such as fans of ThatAnimeSnob. Oddly enough, it takes a ridiculously open mind from a fan of meanings that are by no means promiscuous. It masquerades itself as a simple moeblob, something people who want simple, light-hearted entertainment about cute girls will seek after. It scares away those who spend all their time perpetuating their critical mindset in search of the most thought-provoking anime for the same reason. It\u2019s almost as if it\u2019s meant to be considered a diamond not in the rough, but hidden in plain sight. \\n\\n\r\nI guess the point I\u2019m trying to make here, is that people watched this for the wrong reasons. The beliefs they held about what this show is going to be are, in fact met at the most fundamental level. And like I said, it\u2019s not a misrepresentation that is uncommon around here. They will praise it for the reasons it\u2019s supposed to be praised, and the supposed intellectuals of MAL won\u2019t get around to scrape up the deeper meanings. It is an argument often made that those who are too critical aren\u2019t any better if they cling to certain genres, and hinge their enjoyment on intellectual fulfillment, but obscured themes in shows like these show that they aren\u2019t mutually exclusive, and that clinging to genre conventions and stakes is no way to interpret a show. \\n\\n\r\nThe best way to describe this show is that of a horny NEET that desperately craves for sex, but doesn't do anything provocative, and dresses themselves in plain garments. It only does things that attract a comfortable image, in a way where they're almost scared to say what they think, and hide it behind a comforting exterior. It's just that the people who are just as horny won\u2019t even look their way, because they won\u2019t find appeal as easily in. \\n\\n\r\nIn that case, the show is almost too subtle for its own good, in a way where I can't even call it avant-garde in nature. All I can hope is that this panegyric will do something to rectify that. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading, NICO NICO NII LOVES YOU!",

            "content": "At first, I'm not that kind of guy who watches anime series about Japanese idols because my preferred anime genres are action, science fiction, fantasy, superpower, comedy and slice-of-life. When I've first tried to watch the first episode of Love Live!, everything changed and it is now of my favorite series. Well then, let's get to the review rundown of the series.\r\nStory - Otonokizaka High School is in trouble of closing down because the number of students enrolling this school is dropping lower and lower every year, the school will totally shut down after its first years graduated. Honoka Kousaka, a second year of studentof the said school, doesn't want her school to shut down for good. When she goes to the popular UTX High School in order to find solutions for the prevention of closing down, she watches the performance of A-Rise, a school idol group in UTX, because of this she was inspired to start up an idol group of her own. With the help of Kotori Minami and Umi Sonoda, her childhood friends, they formed the idol group called \u03bc's (Muse), named after the nine Greek goddesses of music, in order to boost popularity to her school. However, it is not an easy task because Eli Ayase, the student council president, opposes the idea of creating a school idol and she'll do anything using her own power to prevent the shut down of her school. In order to make things worse, Honoka and her friends are getting issues of recruiting new members. But when they heard about the idol competition called Love Live!, they'll able to get attention to win and promote the school. Because of this, Honoka is determined to win in order to prevent the school from total closure. The series story and plot is perfect because it shows determination of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nMusic and Sound - As expected, the series music and sound are awesome especially the series' opening music, \"Bokura wa Ima no Naka de\" and \"Start: Dash\", one of \u03bc's insert song performances. All of the lyrics are relatable because some words of the lyrics gives motivation to the viewers that's why I've enjoyed it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - All of the members of \u03bc's are very cute and sweet. They've different personalities as well like Honoka is very energetic and determined, Kotori (my waifu)  is cute and sweet girl, Umi is polite and friendly, Maki is a tsundere, etc. \\n\\n\r\nVoice Acting - In the original Japanese version, all of the members of \u03bc's made noise in Japan and the whole wide world because of their awesome music and PVs (Promotional Videos). Their voice acting is very good and they were able to express their emotions very well. In the English dubbed version of the series, I've realized most of the voice actresses, such as Kira Buckland (Kuroyukihime of Accel World), Erica Mendez (Ryuko Matoi of Kill La Kill), Xanthe Huynh (Yuna Yuki of Yuki Yuna is a Hero), Laura Post (Ragyo Kiryuin of Kill La Kill) and Caitlin Glass (Winry Rockbell of Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood) are strong fanatics of Love Live. Plus, they bring a television actress, Marieve Herington, who also had a role of a TV sitcom \"How I Met Your Mother?\", to provide the English speaking voice of Honoka and former competitive gamer, Faye Mata. Likewise, they were able to deliver their voice very well.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Art - The series is animated by Sunrise, an animation studio that brings you Gundam franchise (suprised? because the studio is notable for action, mecha series), gives the realistic art of some locations in Akihabara such as the Kanda Shrine which became popular thanks to the series. The CGI animation of Sunrise is superb because it gives viewers the feeling of watching PVs.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - The series is super awesome to watch because of the great music and animation. Not only that, the funny scenes will give you laughter when you're down. I've even tried to download one of their songs to my computer and android phone.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Love Live! School Idol Project is probably one of my favorite anime to date. It's cute, funny, fun to watch, and the songs are fun to dance and sing along to! \r\nStory: 10/10\r\nThe story basically goes like this; 9 girls get together when they learn that their school is shutting down to form a school idol group named Muse. With all of them working together they hope to make it to the school idol competition Love Live!\r\nI found this story to be outstanding, it was fun to watch and it always kept my attention throughout the anime.\r\nArt: 8/10\r\nThis is my least favorite part of theanime, though the art is great, the 3D animation throughout the songs is odd and not the best looking, it really stood out but it is a creative idea, but it is the reason I'm giving this an 8. Besides that, the art is cute and they do a great job with the animation minus the 3D, which they improved on in the end.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nThe OST is great throughout the 2 seasons, and the songs they sing throughout they really can get to you with the girls' beautiful singing voices mixed with the music, I think it's absolutely outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\r\nThese girls are colorful, fun, and very energetic! Most are very original and you feel a strong connection with each girl as you learn more about them, and you will at least love one of these girls to death by the end of this idol journey! The only girl I had a problem with was Nico Yazawa, but that's definitely a strong personal opinion since I know tons of fans who love her. Their voices fit with the designs and the outfits were absolutely beautiful, making the girls shine throughout their performances and making me want to cosplay them even more and waste money on them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nEven though this anime has some flaws, I enjoyed all the seasons and even the movie a whole lot, and the spin-off has got me hooked with the new girls. This really got me into music and into idol anime. I never thought I would love this stuff so much.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nThis anime is great! It really makes you happy when you're upset and you'll feel like these characters are your friends and they are all really likable, the music is fun to sing along to as well! I recommend this to everyone reading this, and I also recommend afterwards watching the outstanding movie and the spin-off series, Love Live! Sunshine!! \\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading my review on Love Live! School Idol Project, I hope this helps!",

            "content": "I'd consider it the Star Wars of idol anime. There's nothing unique or interesting about it, I've seen shows that have done everything I seen in Love Live and the plot is kinda contrived and generic.  I've heard that in Japan there are designated spots where you can literally kneel and worship the members of U's like actual religious figures, and I'm like \"are people really that obsessed with these characters?\". \r\nHowever, it does a really great job at what it does. Now, I want to put this out of the way and say that while I like the content of idol shows, Idon't like the actual music in them about 70% of the time. I loved the emotional aspect of the show, I wanted to see Honoka and her friends succeed and the show does a great job at showing how much hard work it is to throw together a bunch of random girls in a school and turn them into national celebrities. There's only a couple things I don't agree with as far as the plot goes, and that's that the reuniting of Honoka and Kotori didn't end with a kiss, and the entire existence of Nico. At least I can go to doujins for that.\\n\r\nLove Live, at least in every other anime community I've ever been in, is incredibly popular and I feel my review of it is barely justified unless there's about 5 people who are still on the fence about it. I hated it for years without even giving it a shot, but when I did, I thought it was better than average. Not something I'd personally look back on, but there's a lot of fans of the series who swear by it to death. Give it a shot if you got nothing else to do, it'll either eat up an afternoon or change your life.",

            "content": "When I was an early teen, I was very much obsessed with girl band groups, ever since I watched K-On~ And this show reminds me very much of it. It brings back good memories.\r\nMy first exposure to this anime wasn't the anime, itself, but the smart-phone music-rhythm game, \"School Idol,\" associated with this. I downloaded it about 4 months ago. I knew the game was based of this anime series, but I was reluctant to finally watch this, because I felt it would ruin the game's immersion for me. \r\nBut I'm really glad that I did finally decide to watch this! \r\nThe plot and charactersare so cute! I love the little flashbacks.\\n\\n\r\nI quickly loved the plot. It actually adds drama to series, but it's not a brilliantly big problem, but there is at least some conflict. I felt the plot took too long to develop in the beginning. And at the end, it got really sped up. \\n\r\nThe art is overall really good, but something that bugs me is that during the dance scenes it seems as if the animators were indecisive (or lazy???) and kept on switching from 3-D figures to 2-D drawings, vice versa. It kind of threw the choreography and the immersion off. I wish that they would pick one art style... \\n\\n\r\nHowever, I do prefer the 2-D dance animation, because it seems more expressive and less robotic compared to the 3-D dance animation.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are a little cliche. It's easy to tell which characters are the air head, the soft spoken one, the tsundere, the shy one, the intelligent one, the cool-acting one, etc.\\n\\n\r\nI do very much enjoy this anime, though. I cried a lot, maybe because I'm sensitive and sentimental! But scenes pulled at my heart strings and made me blubber.",

When I discovered this anime, and when my friend found out that I played the game, I just had to pick this up and join them. The story is pretty simple. A girl named Honoka goes to an all girls high school that's about to be shut down. Not wanting that to happen, she tries to find ways to get girls to come and apply to the school. When she discovers that a rival school has an Idol Group that performsin competitions, she decides to start her own Idol group with her two friends and new girls along the way. It's pretty generic, but I promise that there is more realistic drama in here than what the poster entails. The friendships made in this show are not bullshit. They actually take time to form and there are backstories that make us relate to each of the girls. Out of all the musical animes you could watch, this is a must at 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is just as cutesy and shojo as it gets, but instead of just using 2D animation all the time, they do use some 3D for some song scenes. I do admit that the 3D can be hokey at times, but for some songs, it's pretty good. Because of the colorful atmosphere, it really reminds us that this is a musical anime, and that there's bound to be good music in here. (Where's the iTunes for America!?!??!?!) Because of this, I think 9/10 is in order.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Since this is a musical anime, music does play a major role. I have to say that a lot of songs from this show are really good. The opening is fantastic. The ending is really good (and creative that each voice actress gets her own solo in each episode, but personally, I like the all together ending). I'm trying to figure out which song inside the anime itself is my favorite because they are all pretty darn good. I think I have a tie between Susume or Bokura no LIVE Kimi to no LIFE. They are pretty fun to sing to. If I do have one complaint, I really don't like Kotori's voice. It's pretty squeaky and she can't even sing in my opinion. Fortunately, she doesn't sing too much, so I'm pretty satisfied with that. Overall, I think I would rate this section a 10 out of 10 as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The main girls each have a major role to play in the show. I will warn you that the majority of the girls' personalities are tropes because you need different personalities, ami rite?\\n\r\nHonoka: She is basically your leader and your cute innocent. She's naive, but she's kind and she's determined to do what's right vs. wrong. She loves her friends greatly, and she does get frustrated at times. For a main character, she's pretty good.\\n\r\nUmi: Umi's the nonchalant yet sarcastic best friend of Honoka's who doesn't try to show much emotion but there are circumstances that she needs to snap Honoka back into reality.\\n\r\nKotori: She is very nice, but she can't sing, so I complain about this a little bit.\\n\r\nRin: Three words: Cat girl tomboy\\n\r\nHanayo: The sweetest thing on the face of the earth. Her shyness is so adorable!\\n\r\nMaki: She is the best singer of the group. You can tell that this girl has been singing her whole life because it's just that good!\\n\r\nEli: She's the bitchy character who tries to stop the Idol group from happening since she's the president of her class. Her backstory will make you tear up a little.\\n\r\nNozomi: If there is fanservice in this show, it involves this girl.\\n\r\nNico: Oh my god, I hate this bitch! She's the short, little brat who thinks she knows everything and if it's her fault, she puts the blame on everyone else. I warn you, she's not fun at all for fun-sized.\\n\\n\r\nWith that being the case, I would rate this 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: If you love J-Pop music, this show is definitely for you. I enjoyed each and every episode of it. I laughed, I smiled, I cried all the way. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I recommend this anime, and I'm proud to say that this anime has my personal high score of 9/10.",

The storyline, the detail, the characters, everything about it.\r\nFirst, I was hesitant to watch this anime, yet everyone was talking about it. The story starts with Honoka, a second year in High School. One day she gets dreadful news that her school will be closing down, no longer accepting applications. One day, on her way to school, she stops at a school, featuring a School Idol group named A-Rise. The school would receive a ton of applications because of how popular the Idol Group was. Honoka comes up with the idea, for her and her best friends, Kotori,and Umi, to also be School Idols to hopefully keep the school from shutting down. There is many trial and errors in their adventure to become school idols, but they never stop trying!",

I was recommended this by my brother, who said i  might like it after i expressed my enjoyment of group singing, and i have to say, I really enjoyed this series and thank him for his recommendation. A basic summary, to say the least, is that the protagonists school is closing down, and they form a school idol group to try and save it. Now i won't spoil the ending, i'm not that kind of guy, but i do recommend this, unless you do not like music anime, then i suggest you watch a different anime. Now we getinto the things i didn't like about this anime; the story takes a while to start, and the CG animation they use sometimes is a bit off-putting, especially in the intro, however, I eventually got used to it, I'm not sure if you will however. One of the main things i enjoyed was the songs, I really liked them and feel like i can listen to them outside of the anime. However, 3 episodes out of 13 do not have any songs outside of the intro/outro of the episode, while i admit artists do get tired, it might bother some. Overall i enjoyed the animation and the songs, and felt neutral about CG animation and the slow start to the plot.",

I loved it, specially because in the first season the members of u\u00b4s gave their best but still they haven\u00b4t got the success they were expecting.

It teaches about hard work to achieve our dreams, teaches that school is important and loyal friendship can help us passing all the bad things.\\n\r\nI gave 9 rate to this anime, because I think it\u00b4s really good, the drawing is adorable, the music is lovely and the story is very educational.",

            "content": "RABU RAIBU.\r\nI downloaded the game a long long time ago and got addicted, so finding out there was a promo anime was really exciting for me, though music animes are generally pretty bland and only leave an impression with cute girls. I figured I'd give it a shot and pray it wasn't mediocre. This is where Love Live differs, (though the girls are also very cute) since the show has a LOT more to offer than the standard idol anime.\r\nThis review only applies to season 1, as season 2 would get different scores.\r\nStory: 10\r\nCan't bring myself not to love the story. There wasn't really amain story in the game, more like a bunch of little background information, so seeing the girls get together and interact was an incredible experience. The 3 main girls, 2nd years Kotori, Umi, and Honoka, hear that their school is to be shut down due to lack of interest and struggle to save it by forming an idol group. The girls' dedication to saving their school with which they and their families have history was really touching, and their motivation and love for \u03bc's was inspiring. Love Live really shows the characters moving from the very bottom to the top, and ends with a shocking but realistic ending, albeit very sad. Some girls feel untalented or modest, some girls are nonathletic, some girls feel they aren't girly enough for an idol group, and some have personal grudges against idols, but in the end, they all unite to save the school and form a powerful friendship based on this. The story is original and engaging, so it got a 10 in my book.\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nThe art for Love Live is beautiful. The girls seem to have a sort of emotion in their eyes and all the girls have subtle differences that make them memorable. The colors are bright and the backgrounds are pretty. During performances, many scenes are changed to CG for smoother flow, and though I'm not a fan of CG in anime, I really think Love Live pulled it off, even if it did take a while to get used to. The animation was smooth and the close-ups of the girls were really detailed, showing individual hair strands and lip gloss.\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nWhat do you expect from a music anime? The OST was absolutely beautiful and all the songs were really catchy, and it was incredible to see my favorite songs from the game performed. Very impressed with the music. As far as voice acting goes, the VA's were very into it and very emotional. It really showed how dramatic teenage girls can be and I really connected with some of the things these girls would say.\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nSince there are so many girls in \u03bc's, it was hard to fit all of them in with character development. Season 2 does cover for this, though, and season 2 leaves a whole different impression on its own. \u03bc's isn't complete until half way through the series, so those who take longer to join got more development than others. Some who got little development included Rin, Maki, Nico, and Nozomi, but luckily season 2 does make up for that and gives some incredible filler episodes later. All filler episodes are dedicated to character development and forming a stronger bond between the nine \u03bc's members. Their interactions are very solid and you really get a sense of friendship and a heavy bond between these girls. As for side characters, there are a few reoccurring ones that help the girls of \u03bc's get to the top, and it's cool to see a school anime also develop side characters.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nLove Live exceeded my expectations. I am very glad I decided to watch it, since it has easily worked its way into my top animes. It has a charm to it that makes you feel all warm and fuzzy at the end of each episode, and its resolution and ability to recover from sad moments makes it lovable on its own. Honestly, I think anyone could watch this anime, because yes there's eye candy with cute girls, but more than that, there's a friendship and bond you don't see often in animes and there's an inspirational love for these girls who love their school so much that they form an idol group to save it. Please do yourself a favor and watch Love Live! School Idol Project",

            "content": "I'm like everyone else, you know. I haven't watched an idol anime before, but after I watched this, I think I might do it again. But let's get onto the review.\r\nStory: The story follows a simple plotline. The school is closing, and 3 students in particular really want it to keep going. Along the way, they gain members, and many small things happen throughout the entire show. In my opinion, the story wasn't much, but that's mainly because idol animes are more about the songs.\r\nArt: The art in Love Live is pretty good, take the awkward 3D transitions sometimes. The sections in the songs wherethe idols are dancing are always nice to look at, but the 3D makes it look a bit choppy. However, seeing as how the anime is a few years old, I'll let it slide for now. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Well, the main focus of any idol anime is the music, right? Love Live delivers that nicely, with lots of the songs being obviously well made and have had time put into them. The opening is catchy and upbeat, and their first concert showcases the trio very well. Also, it's the first idol group where all of them equally are important, so that's pretty cool.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The contrast between the different characters works well with the anime. You can tell what roles that they would fill, and what their position is within the songs that they sing. However, development for the characters is only given to a few of them, so don't expect drastic changes in character from all of them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Well, to wrap up this review, I'm going to talk about how enjoyable this was. For me, I enjoyed Love Live more than some people would, seeing as how I appreciate music since I'm \"musically inclined\" compared to other people. if you like music, and can live without a detailed and long plot, then I think you'd appreciate Love Live. However, if you're into more of the plot-oriented animes, you should probably stay away from animes like Love Live.",

I still can't believe that I only found out what it was when I found my friend watching it (which wasn't long ago) and the art got me wanting to watch it. The main question is though did I like this anime? The answer is kind of obvious since you can see the overall score but lets start this review.\r\nStory: 7\r\nThe anime's story made quite a lot of sense (I wont say it here because I don't really want to spoil anything about the story) and is good. I will admit that I wasexpecting a lot more from it (that is why I gave it a seven) but I guess I can't really complain.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 8\\n\r\nThe art is really pretty and the character design is pretty adorable. The animation is decent for the most part but the opening animation felt kinda...weird. The animation performance dances are a little bit weird too.  \\n\\n\r\nSound/Music: 10\\n\r\nI really like the soundtrack of this anime and the opening and ending themes are really catchy. \\n\\n\r\nVoice Acting: 10\\n\r\nI am going to give this attention because both the japanese and english dub are perfect. They fit the characters really well. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\nOh gosh where do I start on how much I love the characters\\n\\n\r\nHonoka:\\n\r\nShe is the main character of the anime. She is really likeable but you can get mad at her because of the stupid things she can do in the show.\\n\\n\r\nKotori:\\n\r\nI really like this girl. She wants to feel useful and be useful. She is really cute.\\n\\n\r\nUmi:\\n\r\nUmi is one of my favourite characters in this anime because she is really loveable and determined.\\n\\n\r\nHanayo:\\n\r\nShe is the shy girl character in this anime. She is pretty likeable and anyone who loves shy girls will really like Hanayo.\\n\\n\r\nRin:\\n\r\nI don't have much to say but I can tell you that this character is REALLY likeable.\\n\\n\r\nMaki: \\n\r\nShe is my 2nd favourite character in this anime. She is the tsundere character of this anime (I love tsunderes if you were wondering) and I really adore her because she is really adorable, I love her personality and her relationship with everyone in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nNico:\\n\r\nI just adore Nico. I REALLY adore Nico. She is my favourite character in this anime and one of my favourite females in anime! She is soo adorable, her personality is amazing and loveable, her relationship with everyone is amazing, she will never give up and she just melts my heart everytime she shows up in the screen. I will admit I found her annoying at first but then I kept adoring more and more.\\n\\n\r\nNozomi:\\n\r\nShe is really funny and her relationship with everyone is really fun.\\n\\n\r\nEli:\\n\r\nSimilar to Nico, I didn't really like her character because I found her annoying but then I started liking her more after a few episodes or so\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nThe characters are amazing and I honestly found myself enjoying love live a lot more than expected\\n\\n\r\nPros: \\n\r\nNico\\n\r\nNico\\n\r\nMaki\\n\r\nLoveable characters\\n\r\nAwesome Voice Acting\\n\r\nBeautiful Art\\n\r\nCatchy Opening & Ending Theme\\n\r\nFitting Soundtrack\\n\r\nNico\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\nThe story could have been a bit more likeable\\n\r\nweird animation in the opening and performances\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nI recommend this anime to people who like or love school idol anime. People who love spice and life/school animes. I loved this anime even though it is not a masterpiece\\n",

I love anything involving girls becoming pop stars/music bands so I was guaranteed enjoyment out of this. I figured I wouldn't like it as much as I did K-On! and I was right, but I still fell in love with the cast and cheered them along until the end. I actually liked the second season more because of the development of the characters and their background, whereas season 1 was more of a cluster of characters following a plot. There are cliche tropes scattered throughout but it's still charming and loveable. Iteven had me a little teary-eyed at the end as everyone can relate to that feeling of growing apart after high school and looking back on happy memories. Nothing new or unique, but enjoyable all the same.",

All the songs are funny and so cute, and I don't understand japanesse, but with themelody I can try to guess about the lyrics of the song.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters (Rin, Maki, Honoka, Hanayo, Umi, Eli, Nozomi, Kotori and Nico) are diferents and everyone is perfect in their way. All are cute and sensitive, and they can teach you things of the life across the eyes of a teenagers girls. Maybe it's a corny and childsh anime for many people, but for me it's beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nIn my personal life, this anime was able to join me a lot with my sister, who had distanced our differences: At first she thought it was an anime to throw up rainbows (all that without even seeing anything of the anime). When we just saw the first chapter, he said: Put the next one\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion: If you saw pictures of this anime, and you think it's an stupitd anime of little girls whos sing and try to be kawaii. Please, give it a opportunity, because it can surprise you.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSorry if it's difficult to understand the review, I'm a spanish fan and I try it to write english without mistakes.",

It's far more than a show, it's hundreds of songs; really well made, sung, written and produced songs; it's genetic moe characters who have a life far beyond the thirteen episodes of this season, or the following season; it's the fun and addictive mobile game that to this day is probably the only iOS game I actually play.\r\nLove Live is just the doorway for many into this expansive fandom, the show and the rest of Love Live has a lot to offer if you're willing to try it.\r\nAndLove Live does something I find incredibly important: it's fun. There are no serious plot elements, or brilliant symbolism, you're not watching the adaption of a Shakespeare play directed by some French guy in an art house theater. But most shows, and especially Love Live doesn't need to be anything like that. The characters are cute, the animation and art is great, the pacing is fantastic, the background OST and the actual music produced by Muse itself is incredible, the fluffy drama and plot elements are like honey in your tea.\\n\\n\r\nIf the music appeals to you. If the game appeals to you. If the general first impression from watching the OP or PV appeals to you... then welcome to Idol Hell. You're going to enjoy your stay here. If you're looking for something the complete opposite of Love Live well then I don't know what to tell you, it's pretty clear what the show is just from the title card.",

            "content": "NOTE: TL;DR for a quick summary at bottom | I keep my reviews SHORT\r\nI give NAME a 7/10 \r\n(May contain minor spoilers) Do you have what it takes to be a school Idol? What is your purpose in doing so? Do you you wish to pursue stardom? or is there another motive towards your goal? School Idol project shows us the the foundation steps of what it's like to become a school Idol.\r\nThis anime in not mediocre as some may say it is, but it's not a masterpiece either. This anime has its flaws but also has its strong points in which it makes itstandout.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThe story follows three aspiring girls in a mission to save their high school from closing down. These three girls have came up with an solution to save their school and that is to form a school Idol club together as they're the most trendiest thing in Japan right now. They will use this idea in hope to bring a new wave of students who then will hopefully apply to this high school which will then prevent it from closing down. Along the way, they find new talents within their own high school which extenders their talent range, from great dancers to great singers.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is another \"Oh I must do THIS to prevent THIS from happening\" and after a while I was contemplating if I should continue on to season 2 or just leave off after season 1 ends. Surprisingly enough, the story isn't half bad. The two main focus of this entire story is that it is essentially a MUSIC genred anime with SLICE OF LIFE. Some may argue that Drama is also a part of this story but I disagree as the anime portrays a happy mood all throughout the anime, even when times go tough. I wasn't dissapointed with the story, infact I found it rather enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art in this anime reminded me a lot of Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso which is a compliment as both animes are music. Back to the topic of Love live, the art was really mind blowing at times. We had scenes where the characters were portrayed beautifully with the surroundings which made them standout a lot. The character design was very well done as well as the scenery for the school. \\n\\n\r\nApart from the compliments that I'm giving for the art style, there was sometimes really random and unprofessional looking CGI scenes. That made the score the art drop by A LOT. If a show has a great art style that shows scenes with amazement, then it should stay consistent instead of doing a lazy CGI to cover up the 'hard' scenes like the dances.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nIt's a music anime, so you should expect the music to sound good otherwise it just defeats its whole purpose. The music was decent, it wasn't something to be amazed by. After all, some may like it more than I would. Don't get me wrong, I loved some of the songs that were shown in Love Live, and some of the OST's as well. It didn't really create the immersion of pop which is what it's supposed to do. But it didn't give a song that I could be attached to. Even after finishing the anime. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe strongest point of this anime is the characters. Each character has their own unique traits and personalities which makes them stand out. I really loved this show for the characters they showed as I liked them all. I especially like the characters such as Umi, Niko, Maki, Eri and Hanayo. Some may liked the others more than I did but hey, didn't I say I liked all the characters? This anime is a prime example of how characters should be portrayed. Instead of having same recycled looking characters, have different characters with different personalities. That is what makes a show stand out.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI can say I'm somewhat satisfied with this anime. I could have enjoyed it much more than I thought I could but it definitely beat my expectations. I'm usually not the type to watch anime's with strictly 'girls' protagonists only but this anime took me into a whole new side for that. My love for the characters is what amazes me the most, as that's the strongest suit for this anime. I enjoyed most of the animes, but some scenes (especially the CGI and pointless drama scenes can be taken out).\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nMy overall opinion of this anime is that it's an anime that is fun, which portays happy looking girls having a fun time at what they're doing. It's essentially not ideal for everyone as some don't like female ONLY animes or pop music animes but you need to take into consideration that the character development for this anime is a job well done. \\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, the things that this anime should focus on improving is the CGI scenes because they just simply look disgusting and unprofessional and also fix up the story so it flows smoothly without these random events occurring. Nevertheless, it's a happy anime to watch.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 8\\n\r\nArt - 7\\n\r\nSound - 7\\n\r\nCharacter - 8\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7\\n\r\nOverall - 7.4\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR - Watch this anime if you're into pop music and girls having fun while doing girly things (because you seriously won't expect a male character).",

Weather news , you'll be disappointed. All you can see was the girl creating clubs and train together. but for \"idol\", like i said, it was waste of good promising plot. one point that i like to point out is this series uses many \"not needed\" slow motion, which i also complained about this on Batman VS Superman. \\n\r\nStory : 7/10\\n\\n\r\nLove Live art is somewhat good , even better than A-1 making Idolmaster, although my biggest disappointment is using 3DCG on the stage. like its utterly pointless to do so because it looks like a cheap MMD that you can see on youtube. The CharaDesign each character are superbly done. especially Maki and Umi. the background also wellmade so its fun to see each episode with good background. other than using 3DCG on live, i'm happy for the art\\n\r\nart :8/10\\n\\n\r\nLove live Opening is somewhat better than Wake up girls! but neck to neck with Idolmaster. its \"genki\" ! its \"fun\" ! no complains on the Opening music. the Insert music somewhat theres 3-4 songs that bit boring-ish... but 3-4 songs is quite an amount for idol songs. because mainly idol song are for \"genki\" up yourself! the ending song are best song in this series, i like it so much.. had gone to iTunes buying this one song because it is superb! BGM are good and very much \"same wavelength\" with the animation. so no problem with me. \\n\r\nMusic :8/10\\n\\n\r\nto be fair, Love Live is a decent idol series with huge potential, but lack of depth and kinda boring-ish. they should expand more onto other idols works such as CM, Radio, TV shows. The most surprising moment is, i realized the idol club that dont have any producer. they should have one though... as long it fulfills, Love Live can become a better series and a real idol club that doing idol works\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nMaki Best Girl",

            "content": "So, love live! The massive mutlimedia project that overtook japan for several years (still a bit at this date). This is this project's anime. To start, I'm a simple guy that rates my anime by enjoyment/feels, and for this anime, it got over the top. I've watched this anime multiple times, and seen some episodes more than 7 times (to show it to some of my friends). Also, this review is gonna be a bit biaised, since this anime has my favorite character, my waifu or in other words, my soul in it, but I will try to keep a criticalpoint of view. I alsoplay the game and listen to all of the love live! songs and go to live screenings.  (warining : minor spoilers)\\n\\n\r\nTo start out, I have to say this anime is very very uplifting, so uplifting that the story is cheesy. Ever wondered how life would be if everything turned out the best possible way every situation? That pretty much explains this anime. That is also the goal of this anime, making everything surreal and amazing, but that's also the charm and what makes this anime special. Is it sooo uplifting, it actually made me so joyful the time I watched it. Although, the plot is pretty predictable, its very fun to watch, 8/10\\n\\n\r\nFor the art itself, I am in love, although the 3d cgi in the songs isn't the best, the rest, from akihabara, to the characters (so damn cute), to the school is very pretty, and suits my personnal taste very well, 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nFor the sound, the seiyuus (voice actresseses) made a very excellent job, and I like each and every one of them. The music was to die for (if you like this kind of music, idol stuff) and the soundtrack matched the anime and its moments. 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nAh, the characters, all of them get developped and are so well thought. They all stand out and complement each other so well, its almost too perfect. I thank this project for making me discover Minami Kotori, my love, my life, my soul (when the first episode came out). Although, to seriously judge, all of the character in this series get a bit of developpement, and are pretty developped, I have nothing to say and like them all.  10/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you are a regular anime viewer and want something very cheerful, musical, a bit touchy, funny and with good music and art, you should give it a go. Please take note it is a slice of life. This anime made my days better, and I would watch it a fourth time (I watch it every once in a while), 10/10 enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall, kotori is in it, so my review is a bit biaised, but, the anime itself made me fall in idol hell and its songs = no regrets. Also, I think the anime itself isn't the best thing from this project, the best thing about this project in my opinion are the characters and the music. I think the first episode is enough to tell you if you will like it or not. You get a good grasp of what the show will be about.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I will watch it again and give it a 10/10. If it weren't for kotori, I'd probably go and give this a 9/10.",
