            "content": "Rewind back to the dawn of fall 2012, you are looking at the fall 2012 anime chart, and you pick probably 5-7 anime you are going to watch. But I can promise that the majority of you, as did I, most likely did not have Shinsekai Yori as a pick. During midst of 2013 I looked at Shinsekai Yori, the promotional picture did not catch my eye and the premises did not spark my interests. However, I did give it a shot and after finishing the anime I can promise that it is truly a spectacle, a diamond in the ruff.\r\nThe story takes place inJapan a thousand years from the present in a utopia where a portion of the population retain a special power called psychokinesis. From the beginning we follow a group of five children as they grow up in the anime and see how they develop within a community bounded by strict rules, and deal with the decisions they make that alter the course of their lives and the entire society they live in. The plot of the show flows very nicely from episode to episode and just as we approach the climax, there\u2019s a plot twist and the storyline from that point just flips upside down in a way you would never expect it to. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime are just something else, with Saki as it\u2019s shining star. The main characters start off as children and by the end of the anime they are adults, with proper illustration of character development. There are a couple of anime who have attempted this children to adulthood metamorphosis motif within one season but they do not pull it off as well as Shinsekai Yori. With an anime that has twenty-five episodes, you would think it would not be enough time for proper character development from children to adults. However, Shinsekai Yori pulls this off very smoothly, which is evidently seen with Saki and Satoru, which even applies to the supporting characters as well. You will not see one character behaving as such and then the next episode they are being the polar opposite, everything is explained and shown very well.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is one of the areas this anime excels in. Every sound that you would not even care for is implemented in every episode and added in the appropriate places, at the appropriate times; the echoing of the voices in a dim room, the rippling of water flowing from a stream. Not to mention soundtrack produced in this amine, which is amazing. Just youtube the battle theme, even if you have not watched the anime yet, it will entice your interests in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe quality of the art and the animation is what you would expect of any anime standards that are out there today: clear, crisp and pleasing to the eye. The characters and the environment in each of the scenes are drawn to a level of detail, not too simple, yet not to far in detail as well, just in the middle. The quality of art really makes you focus on the message the anime is trying to radiate to the viewer; more than focusing of the wow factor on how amazing the art is. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of the enjoyment, this is not an anime that starts off on a high note and continues as such from there. The first two or three episodes really butters you up, but once you hit the fourth or fifth episode, I promise you, you will be hooked and you will just watch one episode after another. Even if you are more into romance, comedy, action or any genre that is not related to Shinsekai Yori, this anime is definitely worth watching and will probably open the doors to other anime series you never bothered to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I really enjoyed this anime, people should give it a try (unexpectedly, it even became one of my favourites). It did not look appealing to me at first, hence \u201cdiamond in the ruff\u201d, but once I started and things picked up, I just wrapped myself in a blanket and marathon\u2019d the whole show. Just looking back at the anime, I will say that one of the highlights of this show is it's ability to take the morals and values of the world we live in and put it into perspective from watching what the characters do to each other and the outcomes that blossom from their decisions. Give Shinsekai Yori a try and you will see what I mean!\\n\\n\r\nI hope you enjoyed my seemingly short review, I would not mind any feedback and if you enjoyed this series or feel enticed to watch it after reading this, feel free to leave a comment !\\n",

            "content": "Little inspection into the dystopia genre is required to realise that the majority of the dystopic anime are set in a cyberpunk universe. Be it Psycho Pass, Ergo Proxy or Texhnolyze, the average viewer is likely to have seen these \"hi-tech\" interpretations of future societies. Enter Shinsekai Yori \u2013 a series where whose setting is uncannily quaint such that on first glance, it is hard to see it as a dystopia; but it is, and an exceptionally remarkable one indeed.\r\n\tWhat distinguishes Shinsekai Yori from its counterparts is the sheer unorthodoxy of its universe. It is one wherethe modern society as we know it has not been replaced by a technologically advanced civilisation but that of a small picturesque town characterised by a community whose lifestyles have regressed into that of villagers. It is within these bounds that we follow our protagonists from the ages of 12 to 26 in this insidiously deceptive world. Throughout the series, Shinsekai Yori\u2019s universe is constantly developed with fascinating conceptions such as the Karma Demons, Cantus and the Queerats (an entirely different yet intelligent species) that all bring into question many of our humanity\u2019s morals and beliefs. Each concept is thoroughly explored and reinforce each other to create a powerful and fascinating dystopia whose elements successfully examines and challenges the philosophies we take for granted.\\n\\n\r\n        Despite its complexity, it does not lazily \u201cnarrate\u201d the ideologies that we question. You won't be sitting through monologues of lecture-like philosophy or psychology. You see society being critiqued through the journey and consequences of the actions of our protagonists. This is what I find to be the most impressive aspect of the show because Shinsekai Yori fully takes advantage of anime as a medium - a feat that I feel is rare in this genre. The characters' dialogue exist to explore their mind whilst it is their actions and interactions with this post-apocalyptic world that we explore humanity. In order to truly appreciate Shinsekai Yori, it has to be completed as only then will the experience be complete as the show's construction of its world is careful to convey certain messages and hidden meanings throughout the show allowing viewers to formulate and reformulate key ideas and questions without ever stooping to overbearing narration.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe characters in Shinsekai Yori all play crucial elements to our story and the range of our cast fully captures the countless perspectives that people in such a world can hold. They are all effectively portrayed via their interactions which unravels how multi-dimensional they are. These interactions are genuine and there is an excellent balance between dialogue, silence and narration from our female lead Saki whose voice actor must be praised for such an alluring performance. Despite the show\u2019s timespan ranging from our protagonists\u2019 youth to their adulthood, the pacing is impeccable as it changes from a slower pace to accommodate the universe-building to a faster pace needed to match the gravity of the conflicts that occur. \\n\\n\r\n\tFor an immense dystopia, it only makes sense for it to be accompanied with diverse artwork. As we observe their world throughout the seasons and its numerous settings \u2013 oceans, mountains, villages both desolate and populated, they are portrayed with their own unique environment and colour choices. This is all contrasted with the use of experimental visuals and cinematography during the more dream-like and ethereal scenes which do not exist to simply invoke awe but contribute to subtly send hints across to the viewer on certain mysteries and foreshadowing certain events. Complementing the visuals is a soundtrack which encapsulates the essence of the show with each track strengthening the visuals and enhancing the overall experience. The soundtrack demonstrates how effectively music can make emotions across the human spectrum more compelling whilst respecting its role of being a supplement to the show and thus maintains our focus on the story the series presents - one which no extent of audiovisuals is required to make its ideas any more resounding than they already are.\\n\\n\r\n\t All in all, Shinsekai Yori is a series that delivers in every single aspect it aims to explore. It displays enough to connect all the ideas examined together into a singular full dystopia but leaves enough for viewers to intellectually ponder and elaborate for themselves. It is profound yet not pretentious and examines humanity without falling into a safety net of tropes that may suffice the viewer but do not inspire. Unlike many of its counterparts, Shinsekai Yori is not a dystopia that relies on a singular premise but a whole host of powerful conceptions that coalesce to create, not just a society, but an entire universe. It achieves this with excellence and elegantly provides us with the most wholesome and meticulously crafted package of dystopian fiction I have ever seen and I unhesitatingly recommend it to anyone who seeks the same.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "\u201cWe ultimately fear what spawns from within us.\u201d\r\nShinsekai Yori was that show where I could sit in awe watching the director roll out things one after the other making it look so very effortless. As a matter of fact, I wouldn't bat an eye if the writer actually happens to be from the future because his description of the \u2018New World\u2019 is not only persuasive but also connected.\r\nThe story is set in the future [1000 years from now] where mankind has created themselves an utopia, though the events are restricted to only Japan. It follows the students of a certain batch in a certain schoolthat helps the students master their PK[Psychokinesis] ability aka Cantus. In this period, PK users[humans] are the dominant species and Queerats are their sub-ordinates or slaves and often address the former as Kami-sama[literally translating as 'God']. We follow Watanabe Saki and her friends through the sufferings and pain they endure as they try to unravel the origin and possibly vile past of their present society. \\n\\n\r\nThe synopsis and the first episode speaks a little to nothing about what the anime truly aims to deliver but the intro of 1 minute[First episode] was enough to keep me reeled in. Fourth episode was bewildering, I had to watch it twice to get most of what was being explained. There was also a portion that temporarily lost my attention and then there was the conclusion that meticulously sealed off the deal on this beautiful creation.\\n\\n\r\nFantasy toned genres never piqued much of my interest but the whole future setting here was surprisingly compelling. Even the plot holes get over shadowed by an unbelievably smooth story transition. One could almost relate our world with the ugly facade put up by the otherwise apparent dystopia. I am deliberately refraining from describing the story but I assure you it's a staggering watch indeed. Whenever I thought- this is it, this is the writer\u2019s limit of imagination, the show would prove me wrong. This is not purely SF or Fantasy, bring in a darker theme, an ingenious screenplay and Shinsekai Yori is born. \\n\\n\r\nShinsekai Yori does contain violence/blood and profanity saturated at some parts of the show. The happenings and revelations in this series can be depressing hence should not be mistaken as a light watch. Shinsekai Yori impressively manages to portray the discriminatory nature in us humans in a completely unorthodox thought provoking manner. Story becomes pretty linear after 6th or 7th episode, but that doesn't stop it from keeping you at the edge of your seat especially near the end. I still can't commend the writer enough for the conclusion he\u2019s given to this work. Best possible ending, as far as it concerns me.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the Homosexual sequences[very little amount of Shounen Ai and perhaps a little Shoujo Ai/Yuri, 1-2 Episodes tops], it saddens me deeply to see people dropping Shinsekai Yori because of the same. I believe they play a tiny yet essential part in describing the re-casted lives of humans of their time and do not qualify enough for a reason to drop this series.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs can be hard to get used to for many, but I've come to realize how much it suits the whole 'Shinsekai' module of the show. A1 pictures out stood themselves again in the Backgrounds Dept. The backgrounds are extremely gorgeous to look at; effects and animation are well above mediocre. Just wow to all the creatures we encounter other than humans and queerats. The color selection fit perfectly and beautifully brings the New World concept to life. Indubitably deserves to be watched in 720p or more.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in their entirety do a great job in painting the manufactured mentality and traits native to the people 1000 years from now. You'll doubt their authenticity, their feelings, pity their helpless state and still be able to relate to a degree, for they are at core still humans like us. Again, this is something that the viewers should see for themselves. [ Queerats : If you're familiar with Harry Potter franchise, Queerats look similar to Dobby, but more disfigured and fat with further diversities as well. Squealer is one of those queerats and plays a significant role in the later half yet main plot of Shinsekai Yori by assuming the personification of 'Resistance' against the atrocities of the Powerful. ]\\n\\n\r\nSound- Bravo! It blends so well into the setting and environment that I couldn't help being mesmerized by it. The BGMs & OSTs were captivating and spot on almost entirely. A custom version of \u2018Going Home\u2019 [adapted from the second movement of Symphony No. 9 (Dvo\u0159\u00e1k)] featured earlier in Mawaru Penguindrum was used in Shinsekai Yori, and for me it worked magic in the latter. I remember watching the first episode again and again just to hear that and the first ED 'Wareta Ringo'. Voice actors did an incredible job, I don't know how but Hanazawa Kana-san's voice always gets me.\\n\\n\r\nI personally enjoyed Shinsekai Yori way more than I'd initially expected. The entire run had a consistent dark atmosphere, which contributed in keeping the tension. I haven\u2019t been this satisfied with an ending in a long time. This is unquestionably a rare gem among the current trend in Japanese animation industry and is not something one should overlook. Sure there are downfalls like the slow pace in initial episodes, few dry episodes in the middle, minuscule amount of homosexual themes that can irrationally put some viewers off, perhaps some sloppy facial animation now and then, but in the bigger picture Shinsekai Yori more than makes up for the flaws and to me it's no less than something close to masterpiece. \\n\r\nThat being said, Shinsekai Yori is not a show for everyone but do try it and decide for yourself.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 8.5/10.\\n\r\n_________________________________________________________\\n\r\nThank you for reading the entire heap. Feedback greatly appreciated.",

            "content": "Shinsekai yori is truly a great series. I've been wanting to write this review for a long time but I decided to wait until the series finished to do so as to write an accurate and coherent review as possible. After 6 months and 25 wonderful episodes, here it is. I will do my best to keep this review spoiler free. \r\nAdapted of the novel by Kishi Y\u016bsuke, Shinsekai Yori tells a story of a civilisation set one thousand years in the future. Mankind has evolved into beings capable of a obscure power known as \"Juryoku\" or Cantus, a powerful psychic power that makes theimpossible possible. In this new world, Man has neither need nor want for technology and reigns supreme over the New World's indigenous species called Bakenezumi and other new organisms we come across as the story unfolds. All seems well and peaceful in the Utopia man has created for itself, however, as our main characters learn early on in the story, Man's evolution came at a price and the New World's mysterious history is written in blood and hidden in secrecy.\\n\\n\r\nInterestingly enough, this series, despite its utter brilliance across the board, has been overlooked by many and is appreciated by few, which is unfortunate as this underrated gem outshines any other series of its season by far in terms of story, characters and execution. Not only is the story of Shinsekai yori highly ambitious, it is intelligent and thought provoking in many ways. Each episode, especially after episode 4, is both thrilling and captivating to the point you simply would not, or better yet, could not view this series one episode one at a time if you had the option not to.\\n\\n\r\nDespite its initial appearance, Shinsekai yori is most definitely not a show for kids; be prepared for a lot of death and gore, deceit and some adult themes. The story requires a great deal of critical thinking to coherently understand and appreciate the narrative. I found myself confused several times early on in the series though the plot later on becomes more linear and thus easier to comprehend. Shinsekai yori is a story that addresses inequality and the flaws of the human condition. It shows us the sinister side of absolute control, the price of secrecy and the perils of curiosity. Undoubtedly, Shinsekai yori tells an intense and utterly satisfying story that will leave you on the edge of your seat and wanting more with each passing episode. The characters featured, both the humans and the Bakenezumi are both compelling and likeable. The main characters prove to be intelligent and very inquisitive but are far from perfect as each have intriguing characteristics that defines them with such subtlety and grace I must commend the author, Kishi Y\u016bsuke, for weaving their personas into the story without making it overly obvious and distracting from the plot. It is my fear that diving in any further in the story and characters would simply ruin the experience and thus I will leave it at that.\\n\\n\r\nIt may interest you that the title name of Shinsekai yori, From the New World in English, was taken from famous Czech composer Antonin Dvorak's Ninth Symphony, written in 1893. I find this to be incredibly fitting as we find out the world set a thousand years in the future is indeed a New World in its own right.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on, the art is somewhat unusual but fitting for an unusual story, more so than any other art style I can think of. Though not much attention is given to detail as far as facial characteristics go, it beautifully depicts the scenery and maintains an overall cleanliness to it anyone ought to be able to appreciate. Truly, it is beyond my ability to describe the fascinating world of Shinsekai yori but I would wager it is unlike anything you have likely seen; before. A1 Pictures has done this series justice in its world building, using just the right colours and shading to create a perfect blend that is both visually pleasing for the average viewer and stays true to the story's setting. The studio has done an above average job the majority of the time with the animation, slipping up only occasionally and consistently producing quality episodes. It is worth nothing that there are some scenes - quite a few actually, that are absolutely breath taking in their beauty. And of course this is only augmented by the angelic scores that play at just the right time, at just the right pitch to deliver a powerful trifecta performance of story, art and sound in an astonishing meld.\\n\\n\r\nI absolutely enjoyed this series. For 6 months this was the one show I looked forward to the most on a regular basis. While it may have a slow start, after the first three episodes the story takes an sharp turn into awesomeness and intensity comparable to a thriller movie. Having said that, there is something to be said for lack of closure on a rather important element in the story towards the end, which unfortunately is left up to the viewer's imagination and some other nuances, but aside from that, it was overall very satisfying and well worth the watch.\\n\\n\r\nWhile not perfect, Shinsekai yori still remains a masterpiece in my eyes, and so my final score is a 10 out 10.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 10\\n\r\nArt - 9\\n\r\nSound - 10\\n\r\nCharacters - 10\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\r\nOverall - 10",

            "content": "In recent years, many series have found success by centering themselves upon flagrant fanservice and fast-paced action. Shinsekai Yori, however, is the antithesis of this trend. \r\nBefore beginning the series, you should be warned\u2014 Shinsekai Yori is not a light watch. This is not the kind of anime that will provide laughter and cheap entertainment. It is an anime that requires the viewer to think and analyze in order to fully enjoy the story. As a result it can be a difficult show for some viewers to get into, but what it provides instead is an experience with far more weight and meaning. \r\nSet inthe distant future, Shinsekai Yori depicts a world ruled by humans with psychic abilities. Using their \"Cantus\", these individuals have the power to meld their thoughts with the outside world. Whether for building, crafting, entertainment, or defense against animals and monstrosities, there are a myriad of ways for Cantus to benefit society. But there are also hidden truths surrounding it. Horrors and conspiracies that will threaten the life of any who uncover them. For Saki and the other members Zenjin Academy's 'Group One', this is a danger that they lamentably fall victim to. \\n\\n\r\nDespite the dark, foreboding tone set from the beginning, it's not until the group uncovers a secret on their school trip that everything starts to go dreadfully wrong for them. Disappearances, assassinations, and invincible beasts aptly called 'Fiends' are but a handful of the mysteries revealed to Saki and her friends. Society is evidently not the utopia that it seems.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is primarily conveyed through the perspective of Saki, but rather than focus on each character individually, Shinsekai Yori instead centers around interpersonal characterization. Group One is often treated as its own character due to the five's inseparable friendship, and this friendship itself serves as one of the core themes of the story. Gradually and together they mature from the naive children that they were at the beginning of the story, directly as a result of their relationships with others. However, do not be misled: this is not an anime about its characters. It is first and foremost a story about the mysteries and conflict that they find themselves pulled into. \\n\\n\r\nAdding to the main cast is an astute race of bipedal mole rats, referred to by humans as \"Queerats\". Despite having intelligence nearly equal to that of humans, they are oppressed and treated as little more than the animals they have evolved from. Understandably they are not pleased with this. Instigating the inevitable rebellion is the Robert Fly colony, led by the machiavellian leader \"Squealer\". His presence serves to create a deeper sense of conflict in the story, but he is also one of the more well-written antagonists in recent years. He is not motivated by tropes such as madness or greed but by a deep sense of loyalty to his people. It's interesting how none of his actions can be defined as inherently 'good' or 'evil', and it makes one wonder if he might have been the hero instead if the story was told from a different perspective. \\n\\n\r\nSuch themes are not uncommon in Shinsekai Yori. Rather than presenting its story through black and white reasoning, there is instead an abundance of pertinent ethical questions posed to the viewer. Does the end justify the means? Do the same rights as humans apply to animals, and what truly sets humanity above them if not intelligence? Complex topics such as the human condition are also explored in detail and the story is not afraid to portray loss and death in a frank manner. This is an anime that's meant to be analyzed and it rewards the viewer for doing so. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the strongest aspects of Shinsekai Yori is its atmosphere. Throughout every episode exists an overbearing sense of dread and melancholy: the feeling that something very bad is about to happen, and indeed it often does. The pacing is also very much on the slow side, with several expository episodes before the story finally takes off, but once it does it becomes very difficult to stop watching. Shinsekai Yori is a macabre, sometimes uncomfortable story that will succeed in immersing you in its dark atmosphere. There's nothing else quite like it out there, which makes it an especially enticing experience. \\n\\n\r\nAs if to defy the conventions of mainstream anime, sexuality plays an important role in the story. The main characters are not innocent and devoid of sexual feelings, even despite their young age in the first two arcs. Much like us, they fall in love, experiment and desire to act out on their feelings. They are not restrained by otaku concepts such as 'purity', and this is an immense benefit given the mature tone of the series. One further thing to note is that they do not only express romantic and sexual desires towards the opposite sex\u2014 but towards the same sex as well. \\n\\n\r\nThough one has to wonder why this created so much controversy. Even if the viewer finds bisexual interactions to be uncomfortable, there is scarcely a scene that displays such behavior in the first place. These relationships are not used for superficial shounen-ai or shoujo-ai appeal, but are instead there to reflect the characters maturing in a society unconstrained by social stigma. The most conspicuous of these few scenes is during the ninth episode, when two male characters play on the grass and then kiss for five or ten seconds. Why did such a trivial scene disturb some people so much? It's hard to say.\\n\\n\r\nThere are certainly legitimate criticisms to be had towards the series, though. In particular, the first few episodes are filled with expository dialogue which oftentimes amount to infodump. Granted, this is necessary to give the viewer a proper understanding of the setting and the rules which the characters live by, but there is no doubt a more elegant approach that could have been employed here instead. Further problems also exist within the two timeskips of the story, as it will abruptly change with no transition between past and present. This is especially an issue in the second timeskip, where twelve entire years are passed in the blink of an eye. We also see very little character growth in that time, which is quite odd, to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nBut these flaws are more than made up for by the sound design. A quality soundtrack in anime is often treated as an afterthought more than anything else, but Shinsekai Yori is one that understands the value that a good score can have. The music here is largely composed of haunting choir melodies, percussion, and ambient noises which serve to heighten the tension and atmosphere of their respective scenes. There's one particular song in the anime, usually used during the beginning of an episode, which was able to send chills down my spine each time it played. Now, this is the sign of a powerful score\u2014 having the ability to evoke emotion through music instead of drama. It would hardly be an exaggeration to say that the soundtrack is Shinsekai Yori's greatest strength, and that is not a statement that comes with little weight. \\n\\n\r\nThe art also compliments the tone of the anime quite well. Dark shadows accentuate the gloomy atmosphere of the story while thick lines are used to emphasize the characters and their facial expressions. There is a lack of polish, though, with regards to detail and animation quality, but you can hardly fault an anime for not being granted a lavish budget. Shinsekai Yori fortunately makes the very most of its modest budget, and its art quality manages to compete with some of the more mainstream titles to boot.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are looking for something unique in an era defined by generic rom-coms and ecchi titles, then this is an anime that will likely fill your appetite. Sure, it may not be a flawless triumph that will be remembered until the ends of time, but as one of the better anime in the past few years, it is well worth your time to give it a try. You would be hard-pressed to find anything else like it.",

            "content": "Fear, Loss, Hope and Betrayal. Desire, Strength, Lies, and Perfection. If only Shinsekai Yori could be described with just these few words. You rarely see an anime that blends the Story, Art, Sound, and the growth of Characters so fluently. Its not simple to achieve this level of artistry. As a result, it\u2019s not a simple story to watch. Your constantly given questions till the very end. However this makes the anime incredibly enjoyable to watch. It feels as though your brought closer into the story because of it. This Dark masterpiece questions humanities desires, darkens the line that separates Children form Adults, and presentsa twisted morality as the cost for power. While never losing hope of a better future.\\n\\n\r\nWith 1000 years passing society has been shattered through the evolution of humanity. Humans awakening of Cantus/Pk, proved to be unruly. As the episodes progress more of the timeline preceding the present is reviled. As shocking as the past appears, sadly its not an unrealistic possibility given the chaos created through Cantus, and the nature of humanity. \\n\\n\r\nThe setting is placed in what appears from afar as a utopia. Vast flora surrounds a seemingly tranquil town. While flowing stream\u2019s cascade into waterways, connecting lands of mystery and wonder. The setting is very breathtaking, although its only the contour of the story. Strongly influenced by the lives and minds of the 5 children in Group One at Sage Academy, a school for teaching children how to use and control their Cantus. The story follows them from age 12 to 26. The main cast is incredibly realistic, often making believable choices and appearing very \u201chuman\". However they feel distant, as far as becoming attached to them. I thought personally while they each had their moments of brilliance, they struggled to break away from simply, appearing \u201cnormal\u201d (Looking past their Cantus of course). Although the cast overall, portray\u2019s friendship and conflict, in a fashion that is easily some of the best writing I\u2019ve seen. Personally I loved having the narration told by Saki Watanabe, I felt an allure about her through out the story. Hearing her reflect thoughts on her past at times, while also watching her own life mature, created a beautiful temperament. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed that almost immediately there is a sense of danger placed into the story. Its not direct at first, but by using stories told by children, it makes for a intriguing prelim. The plot is paced extremely well, allowing for proper character development, (which there is a lot of), and story progression to mature simultaneously. At times it may feel that a lot is explained at once. So don\u2019t be afraid to re-watch a section if you think you missed something. Its difficult to review the story with out touching on spoilers. There are so many details intertwined together, to create a perfectly flowing story. It takes adventurous children, turned rebellious teens, and finally determined young adults. Mix\u2019s in a beastly, yet sadly relatable conflict. This being the sub species Queerats relation with the Humans. While using realistic context, the story also ties in romance and desire. Along with unique ideas such as, Cantus Leakage, Karma Demons, and Fiends. When you put it all together it creates a wonderful story. That with each episode continues to impress. \\n\\n\r\nYour taken into this vast world filled with deep colors, blurring reality and fantasy effortlessly at times. The characters are drawn with detail and look very appropriate. I thought each character had a fitting appearance to portray their personality. Although their design consistency, wavers now and then unfortunately. Some details vary depending on the Key animator, working with that episode. Also a few minor animation effects, such as awkward amounts of arrows. Feel out of place but are easily forgotten by the end. Overall the shadows and colors are always vivid. While the art tone maintains a darker look. The entire story resonates to eclipse the viewer into and different but familiar world. Reflecting rivers and warped realities, the mysterious fauna seen throughout the story. All the Art elements together, create a perfect tint for the clandestine theme in Shinsekai Yori. \\n\\n\r\nWith music generally maintaining a serious tone, Shinsekai Yori has an incredible soundtrack. Traditional Song of Shadows, Ienikaeru (Going Home), History of Sorrow, Last Letter. They are all such moving pieces and there are so many more. The themes and scenery are portrayed wonderfully though the music, making it all very chilling. It seemed to me that appropriate score\u2019s are often used as an introduction, in place of a opening sequence. It was a wonderful choice for the story, because of the absence of a typical OP, the show maintains more of it's mystery. The voice acting is excellent (Viewed Subbed Version). The tones match with the character designs/personalities, and it never feels forced or inadequate while expressing emotion. The entire Sound (Songs, Effects, Voice) is presented spectacularly.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is incredibly detailed and well written. Ranging in all emotion it dose have a more serious tone to it. This is not a show for everyone. However it is incredibly unique, especially well written, and immense with beautiful music. Your able to see children, grow into teenagers, and finally as adults. The emotions of innocence, adolescence, and maturity, mixing together along the journey. Creates characters that are relatable and show believable emotion constantly. The choices made, and how they grew after each trial, made them feel all so real. You watch as life tries to survive, but it\u2019s more then just that. This a true masterpiece to watch. The story will leave you thinking about not simply what you\u2019ve just watched, but about Life and the choices we ourselves make, and the choices of societies past and future. \\n\\n\r\n\"We have to change our way of thinking, If we plan to change the future.\" Watanabe Saki.",

            "content": "Shinsekai Yori or From The New World's most convincing moments occur within the first four episodes. The story, which follows a group of psychokinetic children in the year 3000 in a dystopic yet serene Japanese environment, seamlessly weaves plot device after plot device until the granddaddy of straight-forward storytelling literally walks up to the main cast. A beast is captured by our protagonist, Saki, and explains to them upon request, what has happened to Japan to change it so drastically in the last 1000 years. The world of Shinsekai Yori takes four well-crafted episodes to establish it's universe believably. What follows seems tangentially related tothe original psychological thriller-cum-mystery opening. \\n\\n\r\nA slew of nonsense begins here, where thematically, there was never any room for. A political drama and action anime begins immediately after episode four with a romantic drama unconvincingly inserted in right afterword. This all joined together by a supernatural setting which seems boundless to the viewer leaves for massive plot holes, unnecessary subplots, and outright disregarded information.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of the series are extremely simple. Many characters are written in as attention grabs, who die without doing anything but progressing the story without adding any additional layer of emotion (Inui, Shisei, Squonk,  Rijin). These characters come frequently in Shinsekai Yori and feel cheaply and artificially used. That the story is furthered again and again by use of character introduction and eventual demise at first feels necessary, that the pacing and lack of character focus serve a greater purpose. Yet, by the end of the series we reach a conclusion that nulls most characters entirely from the series, leaving the viewer wondering what the purpose behind many subplots and character scenarios really was. \\n\\n\r\nThe main cast of the series feels particularly unkempt. Between the two time skips, none of the development behind the characters is shown on-screen. For the most part, it felt as if new characters were created and replaced the familiarly named cast. Saki, whose character has unbelievable plot armor, manages to survive every obstacle that she comes to face with despite having average to no ability using her psychokinetic abilities. Opposite her is Satoru. Satoru's character repeatedly changes based on situation, and despite Satoru receiving the most screen time, next to Saki, he never truly interacts with another character. Both he and Saki go on many adventures together, but never do they have any sort of deeper connection other than that they were in the same group of friends together. Satoru's character changes from a one-dimensional precocious to a one-dimensional smarmy without reason, and then from the latter to an one-dimensional hero.\\n\\n\r\nShinsekai Yori attempts at creating a gray morality by only using black and white arguments. Squealer fervently backs up this claim. Introduced in episode five, you can only assume what a character named Squealer can be like. In this leave-it-to-the-name style character design, squealer squeals on the main cast. He betrays them multiple times in three episodes. Then later on when Squealer is reintroduced, he is still literally a backstabbing rodent. The daft main characters seem almost impervious to the obviousness of Squealer, resulting in one of the most painfully direct and drawn out politically based story lines in an anime. The masquerade of moral ambiguity only serves to mock the viewers intelligence, leaving for an extremely expected and dissatisfying ending.\\n\\n\r\nShun is the most interesting character albeit a Gary Stu. Throughout the first nine episodes of the series, he remains mostly static, supplying seemingly otherworldly insight to the other children simultaneously acting humble. He receives a healthy dose of character development during a particularly interesting story line in the series, but is soon forgotten in lieu of continuing the romantic drama aspect of the series. What is worst about this strange intense focus on Shun followed by a dramatic disregard is that he inexplicably  influences events even after he departs from the series. Saki is saved on a handful of occasions through the voice of Shun, which makes it feel once again that the characters only served a greater purpose of linearly reaching a happy ending.\\n\\n\r\nMamoru and Maria are so negligibly involved in the main series events it is laughable, and like their position to the story, their characters suffer immensely. The most thrilling part of their characters is that an uninteresting romance forms between them with no prompt which should be noted is not even really character. This romance of course serves only to produce a plot point later in the series. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound receive solid praise. The series has an excellently used voice cast. The lack of an opening helped the pacing of the anime. The background music, while overused and often misused for a cheap \"spooky\" effect or to create tension in undramatic scenes, for the most part was enjoyably used. Sound effects were decent, but a notable flaw was the clicking of the queerats, which was more annoying than stylistic. The character designs were very bland but served well to create a muted and realistic-looking cast. The animation was regularly on par, but many scenes can be identified as cheaply made by overuse of black backgrounds, extreme close-ups, and static mouths - especially at a distance. Note episode five, without a doubt an atrocity of animation. Beyond that animation was regularly fluid and even exciting. Monster designs stayed fresh throughout the series as well.\\n\\n\r\nWhat started as a fanciful mystery quickly became a predictable drama. As a final opinion, I do not recommend Shinsekai Yori. Many other anime approach it's philosophical topic in superior ways and do so without treating the audience like children. Shiki quickly comes to mind, with Eve no Jikan following on the shortlist. Shinsekai Yori ultimately is crippled by it's many genres and quick, deliberate shifts in tone. The many plot holes and bland characters make for a regrettable and sadly unmemorable watch.",

            "content": "Shinsekai Yori, or From The New World, is a teen-oriented piece of dystopic speculative fiction, the latest addition in this new wave of teen fiction to which the success of Hunger Games has opened the doors.\r\nThe series follows the adventures of five kids, from their childhood to their adulthood, in a medieval-ish post apocalyptic setting, where the only human left are the one possessing a special psychic ability called \"Cantus\".\r\nWhile the first episode is quite good, establishing the setting and the mysteries behind it (\"what's the government hiding?\", \"how did the world get like this?\"), the series pretty much falls downwards after that, with episode2 weirdly shifting the tone to high-school hi-jinx (admittedly it is foreshadowing but, as it happens many times in the series, in order to deliver us world details it suddenly changes tone, making for a very disjointed and uninteresting episode) and episode 3 basically killing any mystery with a long exposition sequence.\\n\\n\r\nWith almost everything resolved, the story stumbles aimlessly for ten or so episodes, as... things... start to happen. We get to see lots of short story arcs that, while again foreshadowing small story details, don't really feel connected to each other and don't offer any particularly gripping narrative. The series even pushes the reset button a couple of times, making the character forget, and having to re-learn, story details that we already know... riveting...\\n\\n\r\nThe story does pick up a bit with the last story arc, putting together all the awkward foreshadowing it did until that point and finally having a long story arc that feels significant to the world in which it is set.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I feel that the first batch of episodes was intended to be about establishing and exploring the main characters before letting them loose in the final arc, in the practice it doesn't really work that well. First of all, I'm sorry, but the characters are just not that interesting, as most of them are pretty one note, secondly the main conflict of that part of the series is basically kids vs shady government... which would be fine, except that the government in question is... just not that shady, as again we learn all of their motivations in the third episode... and... they make quite a lot of sense.\\n\\n\r\nAlso this series has a serious problem with beating us over the head with things that have already been explained over and over again.\\n\\n\r\nSo... with an interesting setting that gets squandered, likable but ultimately flat characters, big problems with tone and pacing, and the trivialization of any mystery element the series could have had... is there anything good in Shinsekai Yori?\\n\\n\r\nWell there is that one amazing musical theme we get to listen at the beginning of some episodes, and the series direction is quite good and can set a very eerie mood when it wants to (and when the characters shut up). Most than anything though I like how it engages with sexual themes, working as an interesting allegory for the sexual confusion of puberty and adolescence.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest I quite like how Shinsekai Yori approaches youth and puberty as a whole. and how it manages to translate those themes into a post apocalyptic coming to age story. Sadly though, while the ideas behind it are solid, the execution leaves a lot to be desired. The fact that it is a 25 episode slog doesn't really help, as it does feel that with a few episodes cut down the series would flow a lot better and generally be far more enjoyable.",

            "content": "Shinsekai yori is an adaptation from a novel, with the same name, which has 2 volumes that were released in 2008.\r\n The story of this anime takes place a thousand years from now, many humans have evolved, now they are able to use a psychic power called cantus, but there's no improvement in technology.\r\n In that kind of world , the 5 protagonist, live in a village that's seems normal at first sight, but they start to realize that their town have a lot of forbidden knowledge, to put it simple Shinsekai yori is the tale of a group of friends that start discovering manyconspiracies, and how that affect on their adolescence.\\n\\n\r\n When I watched the series I couldn't help to compare the events, on how the conspiracies affected me, and I didn\u2019t find many differences, because the reactions of the characters are portrayed very well.\\n\\n\r\n The story also has good action phases, fast scenes, warlike times; fantasy besides the humans, the animals have also evolved, now they are able to think, speak as humans, and that makes them more interesting and important in the plot; mystery, the fact that censure/conspiracy is the most recurrent theme in this series makes mystery one of the strong points of this anime, here you are equal with the protagonists discovering the mind blowing secrets of that society. With those aspects and many surprises, the story in synthesis is so dynamic, that makes the necessary suspense to make me wish for more after the end of each episode. (10/10)\\n\\n\r\n Concerning art, with pretty sceneries, animation that is slightly better than the standard in the late 2012, shinsekai yori deserves a \"very good\" and a bit more in art, but how the complex power of cantus and the mystical scenes are well portrayed, for me it deserves the \"great\". (9/10)\\n\\n\r\n Now sound, well in like the 5 episode, i realized \"wait... this anime lacks of OP\", but I don't mind, the ED \"wareta ringo\" it's so good, even the lyrics of the song have the essence of the series, I\u2019m even grateful that the anime doesn't have an OP, because I can see more shinsekai yori, and that the ED didn't change after the episode 13. Concerning the background music, it never disturbs, it has good relaxing songs, and it placed at the exact moment, so it's good. (9/10)\\n\\n\r\n Characters, I think that here is where shinsekai yori shines the most, because the psychological characteristics of the characters is splendid, there's always an explanation to the reactions of the protagonists, and the reactions are never exaggerated. I consider shinsekai yori as a psychological drama, because the psychological factor is fundamental in the series. Also knowing that they are teenagers, their changes are so unpredictable, that helps to the dynamism of the series. (10/10)\\n\\n\r\n Enjoyment, here there's not much left to say, as I said before I can't wait for another episode after seeing one, I really like this series. (10/10)\\n\\n\r\n And finally overall, I haven't seen a well thinked series like this before, where nothing is random, this anime makes you think, and entertain you. It's seems that many people drop the series (and gave it a low score) in the first chapters, because the story is so slow at the beginning of the series, but who prefers a series that starts good, then it begins to get bad and finally it ends horrible; in this anime occurs quite the opposite, it starts slow but then every ep is better. I highly recommend this series. (10/10)",

            "content": "There's often a point in one's life to acknowledge the possibility of another worldly phenomenon that is outside of our collective conscience from where we live in that is in contrast with our own ideals. This has always been a subject of discussion since Plato's \"Allegory of the Cave\" that chronicles how our limited understanding of the reality that we perceive may not be what it seems since we're so entrenched in our own ideological society. Many works of fiction have dabbled this subject matter numerous times with some succeeding and others failing. Unfortunately for Shinsekai Yori, it falls into the latter, but not entirely.\r\nTostart out the basic idea of how the story of Shinsekai Yori pans out is the fact that it's a coming of age story focusing on five different characters and their journey in discovering what the past history of human civilization eventually transpired into pure dystopia. In the beginning it starts off extremely well with building up these characters that are all very unique and distinguishable from each other. There's never a moment where I couldn't remember who a specific person was and it's not just from their appearances but from their well-written personalities and backgrounds. Their childhood arc paces itself nicely in giving an atmosphere for us to take in that's mysterious and puzzling in a very limited understanding of what the world is actually like because that's how the childish mindset would actually be like in this scenario. However, once that arc was finished and we get our first time skip it doesn't get too extraordinary as one would hope.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that makes the time skips really off-putting is how there's hardly any build up on how these characters' personalities matured over time. For instance, one of the most controversial things about the show was the relationship between the characters that were of the same-sex. It's not so much the relationships themselves that I have a problem with, it's how it comes out of nowhere with hardly any development behind it. In this sense it feels as though there was more to their relationships but for the sake of timing constraints they had to rush it so it won't feel dragged out. Because of this one might feel inclined to give it a pass, but for me that cannot be forgiven with the given context this show brings on the table in wanting to be this grand epic that ultimately feels lazy from a writing perspective. In fact, the best romantic development in the entire show was between Saki and Satoru because of how long we've followed these two together and how strong their bond was in helping each other through the hard numerous obstacles. Alas, the rest of the relationships that are thrown out didn't really make a huge impression because how weak and lazy they implemented it into the story; if they actually had anything of value for us to see how they got to that point it would've been for the best.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the story itself isn't something we've seen before, it is still a mysterious and very suspenseful drama that manages to pull off some great twists through the course of the narrative. That is until the realization comes to mind when the pacing of it all fails to make it a masterpiece in the writing department. Like I said before about the time skips, they really dumb down the pacing because of how they rush some of the arcs that felt like they could've been more effective had they have been done with better intentions such as at least showing us a montage of them overtime. That shouldn't mean that time skips are unnecessary in any given situation but it takes a lot of care and precise handling to make them work. Time skips aside, the other pacing issues mostly happen in the middle part of the show where scenes lacks clarity in it's exposition in giving us a clear concise way of what has happened or what will happen to the characters or future events. Too fast to even comprehend the over-arching conflicts that arise from the protagonist feel muddled and disorganized for us to piece together on what will transpire. This could come into play with the fact that the show skips over some of the important details in the novel, but for the sake of reviewing the show itself there's no need to go over that aspect.\\n\\n\r\nHow Shinsekai Yori handles its world-building through expository dialogue receives a mixed response from me. It works like a pattern where one of or all of our heroes are journeying or trying to find answers and eventually they'll talk to someone who will explain everything to them in no more than ten minutes either the dark history of Japan and how it eventually became a grim dystopia or what the ethics counsel is really like underneath. While the history itself is really thought-provoking at times that bring into question human nature and how society structures itself into chaos, I can't help but feel that it could've been done more better with less tedium and not feel like a lazy attempt at being profound.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not just the writing that feels off, but the technical side of the show feels very limited and looks really shoddy in the process. That's not to say all of it looks bad, there are definitely a lot of beautiful set pieces drawn into the backgrounds and the character designs look very unique and fit well to the tone of the show. However, there are a lot of problems with the designs of the monsters that inhabit Shinsekai Yori where they don't look really well-drawn and their animations look like if a low-budget studio was hired to animate them. There's even one episode where the animation took a complete nose-dive where the queen of the queerats looks like a huge blob that wasn't drawn fully of what it was originally supposed to look like. I'm not saying that all shows have to look extremely high-budget or in order to be called good art/animation but it doesn't really strike my fancy when there's nothing significant to gaze at to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nNow with all of the negativity I've had for Shinsekai Yori, there are still a number of things that are really good and even fantastic that are worth watching. It is without question that the amount of suspense and heart-pounding tension that Shinsekai Yori has to offer is astonishing to say the least. The first three minutes of the first episode alone garners some needed praise for it's really well-directed atmosphere, right down to the music and editing of all of the events that happened in present-day Tokyo. It's tone is not pretty and it will nonetheless make a lot of people feel uncomfortable to sit through in some instances, but that should warrant a lot of credit to the show in giving us a very mature tone that comes in full-swing. What makes the suspense amazingly good and imposing is the amount of mystery that we are given through the children's perspective and how we can never see how the adults' see the situation that goes on in the world. Often times you don't see stories handle mystery this way and make for an intense experience to go through. The first person narrative through Saki gives a distinct feel to how we see her grow into this person who is fully aware in later life that feels undeniably human to me.\\n\\n\r\nAs many have told me about the story in all of its faults is that the ending makes up for it, and it definitely does provide to the story a satisfying conclusion. There were definitely no predictable outcomes that were present in the narrative's end and that guarantees Shinsekai Yori some much needed acclaim for at least not giving us a story that isn't inherently generic in a predictable sort of way. There's no Hollywood gimmick that severely tarnishes the gritty tone, it handles itself in a very realistic fashion that feels very satisfying to see first-hand.\\n\\n\r\nMusically, it mostly consists of really bombastic chanting music that is very haunting and intimidating from the style of tone it tries to set. There are very few questionable choices of songs that Shinsekai Yori has that feel out-of-place in any scene. Intense orchestration that also borrows from some minimalist influence in some ambiance tone it gives with light electronically ambient mixes in-between scenes that are inherently quiet and simple in their nature.\\n\\n\r\nAmbitious though it may be, Shinsekai Yori just doesn't cut it fully as a supreme masterpiece that has come out in recent years with the problems it possesses in giving us a badly paced story that can't really give a concise narrative that's hard to get around. Character development feels good in some areas, but due to the poorly put time-skips, their relationships felt contrived with inconsistent expository problems that feel as though they wanted to make the same-sex relationships so that it would seem more progressive when it really comes off as just lazy development. I wouldn't classify this show as completely bad in that the amount of suspenseful tension makes for a really intense experience to behold in showing us the one great development of Saki into a full realized character. After all, a worthwhile experience with many faults in its technical aspects is at least more tolerable than a show with great technical prowess with no added value to the experience whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: B-\\n",

            "content": "Shinsekai yori was something else...\r\nFirst let me say Shinsekai yori was not a light watch at all. This is a thinker's anime. Casual viewers will probably be very turned off by the serious nature of the show. Having said that, for those of you who are looking for an anime that shows the story of a dark, fear ridden society in a brutally honest way keep on reading!\r\nShinsekai yori is unique in which it has no correct set of morals. The line between good vs bad is blurred to the point where the viewer sympathizes with the antagonist.\r\nWhy is this?\r\nIt is because Shinsekai Yori isvery realistic. \\n\r\nLet me give an example to further the meaning of the previous statement: In modern society many consider stealing to be a sin while others justify the act in order to feed their families.\\n\r\nIn other words survival is all that matters and that is what Shinsekai yori is, a situation in which survival is the only thing that justifies an action or not.\\n\r\nNow logic such as this will undoubtedly result in very disturbing outcomes and decisions so viewers should brace themselves for very gruesome events.\\n\\n\r\nIf anyone is expecting to see plenty of action/comedy/happiness I suggest you think twice about trying this anime. Positive moments are stretched out far in between and thus rare throughout while tragedy is almost always present. Also casual watchers should beware that Shinsekai yori requires some degree of analysis for it to be enjoyed to its utmost potential.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are still with me, Great! Here goes the review. Everything is spoiler free!\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9.5\\n\r\nThe setting involves a dystopian society 1000 years into the future that has actually reversed progress regarding industry and technology due to human beings obtaining telekinesis. We observe the society of year 3000 through the eyes of 5 children who are just as clueless as the viewer. The story is narrated by one of the children, Saki, as the anime shows the events of the children's lives and their fates from the ages 12-26. Throughout the anime the group of five learn of the evils and secrets that society has hidden away. Upon learning, life changing events take place throughout their lives, affecting not only their relationships but their sanity as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Shinsekai yori takes the concept of a dystopian future but applies it in its own very original style. It explores various sinister and dark themes of the human mind through solving the thrilling mysteries of the society and its past.\\n\r\nThe story was highly original and refreshing due to its thought provoking and mature layout. Taking a story such as this and adding the amount of realism Shinsekai yori provides results in a story that is close to flawless.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7.5\\n\r\nNow I must admit, the art would amaze me one episode and then would make me cringe the next. For example there were many instances where some of the character's faces and bodies were so warped it shocked me that such mistakes were made in production. Although having said that, there were various instances where the art was absolutely stunning. Gorgeous still shots and surreal dream sequences beautifully portray the gloomy environment. \\n\r\nJust try searching up Shinsekai yori and looking up some HD scene pics.\\n\r\nI give the art a 7.5 because the production team really made some episodes look absolutely horrible while others were done brilliantly.\\n\r\nTo sum it up the art is inconsistent and is a hit or miss depending on the episode.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nShinsekai yori did not have an OP, which may bother some. I skip the OP 95% of the time so the fact that Shinsekai yori had no OP was not a negative factor personally.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was spot on in providing the gloomy dark atmosphere for the anime. It really stood out. Each time a track played it would send shivers down my spine as I watched in awe as to what was happening on screen.\\n\r\nFor the episodes where the art was done well, once the music played, it would produce some of the most chilling scenes of any horror anime I've ever seen. \\n\r\nOne thing that should be noted about the music is that it is very repetitive and is rarely varied. Although in Shinsekai yori's case this isn't necessarily a bad thing.\\n\r\nWhy change something that does its job 110%?\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7.5\\n\r\nNow I have to admit that the characters are decent at best. I doubt that even Shinsekai yori lovers and fan boys would put one of the characters in their favorites. Although they are not very memorable the reason I gave it a 7.5 was because their actions and reactions were very realistic (something the whole anime has going for it). From tough decisions to shocking news, all the characters reacted in ways that the viewer could relate to. \\n\r\nOther than the realism most viewers will likely not be very attached to the characters which will thus reduce the emotion induced upon tragic events.\\n\r\nNonetheless, I still give it a solid 7.5.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\\n\r\nBoasting a plot and environment that could have potentially catapulted it into my group of masterpieces Shinsekai yori falls short due to suffering to a tedious build up with some unmemorable characters and inconsistencies in art.\\n\r\nOverall I highly enjoyed Shinsekai yori and its wonderfully refreshing story and believe that any anime fan that truly loves mystery, horror, and plot twists must give Shinsekai yori a try.\\n\\n",

            "content": "[4.0/10]\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\nWe wage war that tears down walls and buildings brick by brick, as our own inventions create and destroy. We put roofs over our heads only to light them ablaze. We create a hierarchy only to rebel against it. It's an endless coil, a snake eating its tail, feasting on the notion of betterment. If we dismantle our creations enough times and iterate upon them, surely we will reach that stretching plateau of perfection that our own ideology believes in. Yet once the dust and soot settle, we can only regret our impulsivity, our misunderstanding; the ladder of progress we eagerly climb is infinite, andthere is always someone looking down on us. Yet from that rubble, a flower blossoms. \\n\\n\r\nFrom a New World is desperate to tell us what we've been told before in a unique way. Whether it be that despotism is bad or that uncompromising control of sentience is evil, the results are virtually one and the same, and in this case, necessary. Furthermore, much like any tale of dystopia, we are presented with similar character beats, analogous narrative structure, and identical revelations. Yet none of this is a negative to me. See, I like dystopia. In fact, this signature sci-fi concept is one of my favorite tropes in entertainment. I like seeing similar ideas be iterated and expanded upon. I even find joy in witnessing ignorant, blinded characters have that signature horrifying revelation of, \"Oh shit, my entire life is a lie!\" \\n\\n\r\nFrom a New World reinforces that joy, as the narrative itself is, in concept, quite good. An impressive, detailed world that was clearly birthed and seasoned at the hands of a novelist. Their pen bursting with ideas, as they terraform a white mass into something rich and structured. You could make an encyclopedia out of the knowledge given, albeit a short one, and still feel as though the folded over edges that hide that last inkling of wisdom are just out of your grasp. A flurry of creative concepts that give and give until you are figuratively stuffed and questioning what is truly right and wrong in this imagined world. \\n\\n\r\nI don't feel as though I'm discussing the series, though. For all the creative strength that Yusuke Kishi, the novel's writer possesses, little of it is adapted. By that I mean, it feels as though A-1 picture's, in all their incompetence, simply took the words on his page, stripped out the prose and detail, and injected them into their abridged script. I see nothing but the story in From a New World, and for a product that is an audio-visual experience, utilizing both audio and visuals in such heavily flawed ways is beyond inexcusable. \\n\\n\r\nAn infection spreads throughout the presented world. That infection is power, the ability to control and manipulate objects and people. These infected people destroy out of fear, out of want, out of desire, and the world collapses at their whim. Through that collapse, a new society and hierarchy are birthed. New rules are created, new ideologies formed, yet the remains hang just below the shimmering surface, waiting patiently. That permeating mysticism is the backbone of From a New World. Especially once we are introduced to Saki Watanabe and her merry clique of character archetypes; each one varies in hair color, personality, and talent. That talent, of course, is what they are together for. You see, in Kamisu 66, one of the many sleepy towns that dot this new world, children discover their innate powers about when puberty hits. From there they are inducted into an academy and begin learning how to harness their strength.\\n\\n\r\nAs viewers, we are thrust into this setting with enough exposition to clue us in on just about every action taken that isn't purposefully shrouded behind the pervading mystery. This group is sent out exploring, adventuring, getting in trouble, all with the notion that they will come into their own. What becomes clear is that this society is constantly on thin ice. Any unwanted movement risks the collapse into the freezing water. If the allegory behind power isn't clear enough, let me also mention the subservient colonies of \"Monster Rats\" that reside in this world as well. Ugly, mole-like creatures that show intelligence, yet speak with slurred, barely comprehensible speech. They don't have power so they serve the ones who do. Get it? \\n\\n\r\n\"Are we the baddies?\" May as well be the thesis to From a New World, and that is inherently interesting. The notion isn't spelled out immediately but seasoned veterans of dystopian writing can most likely deduce that the progressed, oppressive side is generally the one you should not trust or at least question. Whether their actions are necessary is half the intrigue in From a New World. Once again, all of this is taken from the novel, from the source. These ideas are lifted and splayed out in front of us. Examining the series itself, though? We are left with eerie orchestral vocals and stringing chimes to enrapture moments of total flaccidity. \\n\\n\r\nA-1 Pictures can't seem to get it right. Their feeble attempts with Your Lie in April, smothering every element of music behind manga-esq exposition about how beautiful the music we can literally hear is. Or, in this case, deciding to ignore the fact that anime is an audio-visual medium. The fact of the matter is, From a New World is unbelievably boring. It is, for the first fifteen or so episodes, one of the single most flat and tedious series' I have ever put myself through. Virtually everything about this series is flaccid. The animation, directing, even the musical stings are often used ad nauseam. Nothing is given room to breathe; everything that the adaptors thought needed to be explained was explained. \\n\\n\r\nYou see, a novel has the ability to have large exposition dumps because the reader sets their own pace. A fast reader can shoot through these segments and siphon all the necessary information from them. Especially when large sections of supposedly good, mysterious plot progression is back ending these bursts of exposition. Yet the series doesn't have that quality. It's a twenty-minute anime, and that fact ruins the entire product! The writers need to get this massive amount of information across, so they have to cut out those valuable segments of proper writing because there is no time to have them. They rush from beat to beat and those beats are the least interesting part of a visual medium. That's not to say it is unable to be adapted. It simply requires a talented, unique approach to showcasing information diagetically. \\n\\n\r\nIn episode three our group stumbles upon what I can only call a glowing information hedgehog. While they call it a false minoshiro, all it is is a glorified exposition machine. That entire episode was them sitting in a generic, boring anime forest listening to this man-made device literally tell them everything they want to know except what just so happens to be a crucial piece of information the entire series wants to keep a mystery. It's genuinely unbelievable how weak this presentation is. Now if there were redeeming factors to the shot composition or animation maybe I could remain engaged for what is a glorified reading of a Wikipedia page. However, there is none of that.\\n\\n\r\nFrom a New World is ugly. It has this somewhat unique aesthetic, with flat colors and a gray, dusty palette. Yet the director has seemingly no idea how to direct color, or images, for that matter. You'd think it is easy to create compelling shot composition when you have virtually no animation to worry about, yet this series' unsightly palette is all that is to be seen. From a New World uses something I see in every A-1 show and plenty of other anime; I call it \"texture muddying.\" They are clearly rushing the product and the artists either don't have the time or talent to draw proper backgrounds, so they instead just color a texture onto flat environments using what I imagine is a tool from their digital art software. These environments lack all semblance of depth and quality, resulting in some horrendous design. Decent character-designs stand in fields of muddy greens and shit-stain browns that are drained of all vibrancy for no apparent reason. \\n\\n\r\nSimilar to last season's Violet Evergarden, the director isn't grasping why one should use a certain color palette or filter, instead prompting for a stylistic choice that holds absolutely no reason or merit. Glaring, abrasive CG rocks are hurled through the air in some tensionless action scenes where the characters take a backseat to whirring, synthetic sound design that is constantly repeated for every telekinetic \"move\" these characters employ. \\n\\n\r\nThis aggressively weak presentation is compounded by endless exposition that disregards any potentially interesting writing for blunt explanation. It lasts for minutes on end with minimal flashbacks or any sort of engaging material to consume. The application of these ideas is beyond misguided and feels downright disrespectful to the author who clearly put effort into this world. More so than just that, the series feels as though it is presented through a passive voice. Nothing is imminent. Nothing is about to happen. It already happened. Multiple episodes pass with virtually no tension established. \\n\\n\r\nFor example, a character runs away and hides from their impending doom at the hands of their own people! Yet we don't see this. We see their friend's reacting to their disappearance and then finding them. Seven minutes of exposition as to why they left ensue. A few minor, fuzzy flashbacks reveal what they experienced and then the credits roll. This happens constantly. Everything experienced by our protagonist, Saki, always feels as though it already happened and the viewer is just treading on ground that has been stampeded on. The majority of the actions she takes aren't even out of her own volition, and the small number of actions she decides to take are either frustrating or minor in the context of the entire series. \\n\\n\r\nI can only place this blame on the series' presentation. Virtually every fault is at the hands of the people adapting this novel, as they visibly fumble over themselves and fail to convey any form of intrigue when by all means it should exist in abundance. Once these tedious pieces begin to fall away and we enter the third act of the narrative, we are met with more focused storytelling. It feels as though the earlier segments only existed to convey the few ideas that were carried over into this act. I began feeling somewhat rejuvenated and started to enjoy the kinds of revelations I was expecting from this narrative. None of it was all too surprising, but as I stated earlier, I like dystopian stories and From a New World breathes some interesting ideas into this potentially stale conceit. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, once the final credits roll I couldn't help but ask myself whether the many hours of tedium and despondency was worth the neat conclusion and I can't help but say no. It really wasn't worth it. The presentation is so weak that reading a summary or just the novel itself would've served to be a better way to spend my time. If watching this series was like biting into a sandwich made of mud and feces which housed a delicious piece of chocolate at the center, chewing through all that only for a hint of sweetness would still result in a putrid taste. \\n\\n\r\nThe title of the series breeds mystery, intrigue, a will to go forward and discover what comes from the new world, both literally and figuratively. I'm sure the novel follows through with that mystery at least to a certain extent. I can't judge the novel based on the abridged, mangled body presented by A-1 Pictures, though, and I would never want to. What was initially a holistic work was chopped up to only include the most mandatory elements presented in a lifeless way with sporadic moments of inspired shot composition blended hideously with endless, muddy animation and tensionless scene structure. However, the ethical questions of greater good and excusing horrendous actions to negate even more frightening results is fascinating. A truly unique way to expound upon established dystopian concepts and pulling inspiration exactly where it is iterated upon. \\n\\n\r\nGiving appropriate praise where it's due, From a New World succeeds through its ideas, and fails through its presentation. Sadly, that's hardly a feat in this medium. In film, visuals are the single most important element. The same should be applied to animation. We can have a film without sound, without story, yet it can be something that blooms with quality. A novel is bound by different chains, so an adaptation requires a specific effort to be applied to change a long-form story into a completely different medium that utilizes unique presentational elements. As it stands, the title is what breeds the mystery. The cover art was why I initially picked this series up. Yet From the New World, only disappointment blossoms.",

            "content": "Everyday we wake up, preform our daily ritual, then go to sleep, and all the while the world around us seems so perfectly normal. We, as people, have evolved to accept the normalcy of everyday life. It is seeing how people really act when normalcy is torn away from them that many people find so intriguing. \nThe sad fact of the matter is that mystery thrillers are so rarely done right that people over look them without a second glance. Shinsekai yori is one of those gems that does it right, and should not be looked over so easily. \nThe Story (10):\nShinsekai yori is setone millennium in the future. Yet the the depicted future will remind you more of a feudal japan as there are no fancy gadgets or mecha robots to really say \"Hey, this is the future!\" Instead people in this distant future have created themselves a Utopia, and hold psychokinetic powers know as Cantus. \\n\\n\nIn this \"New Age\", Cantus users are the dominate species on the earth, while humanoid rats known as Queerats also inhabit the planet. They are treated mainly as slaves and do work that Cantus users don't deem worthy to be done by themselves. These Queerats literally refer to Cantus users as God.\\n\\n\nThe events of Shinsekai yori follow a certain group of friends as the try to master their Cantus through schooling. All the while Watanabe Saki and her friends try to unravel the mysteries of their society, and in doing so also unravel the normalcy that we humans hold so dear.  \\n\\n\nThe first three episodes are entirely used for world-building, while nothing special they lay the foundation for a beautifully intricate story to be woven. After finishing episode four, the story of Shinsekai yori becomes a compelling work of art. Any small plot holes this anime may seem to have are hugely overshadowed by the seamless transition from one episode to the next. \\n\\n\nIt becomes almost impossible not to relate the world of Shinsekai yori to the world we live in now. As normality is ripped away from the lives of our protagonists and the darker themes are revealed you will realize how truly mind boggling the writing of this masterpiece is. \\n\\n\nThe ending of Shinsekai yori could not have been better. It leaves no questions to be asked and really ends the story right. It does not leave one wanting more, rather the ending concludes the story in a way that sums up all events and any questions you may still have.\\n\\n\nOne of the biggest complaints about the story of Shinsekai yori is that there are homosexuals scenes, and yes there are. These scenes are in 1-2 episodes tops and the are completely relevant to they story. I assure you that they are not there for no reason, and will, if anything, add to the depth of the presented story. \\n\\n\nArt (9):\\n\nThe character designs of Shinsekai yori may take some getting used to for some, but it very beautifully done and suits the work quite well, the backgrounds are desktop worthy, and the animation effects are quite stunning. \\n\\n\nThe only misleading part about the artwork is that it appears to be very light and happy. Shinsekai yori is not light and happy, Shinsekai yori does have some graphic violence at heaver points in the show and the art style can somewhat take you out of the moment. But it in will no way keep you from being on the edge of your seat as you click on the next episode. \\n\\n\nThe highlight of the art in Shinsekai yori is by far the backgrounds you will see. The artists put a tremendous amount of detail into the work, and it payed off in making some of the best scenery porn in anime.\\n\\n\nSound (10):\\n\nWow. The tracks played with this anime blend so smoothly into the moment that you won't even realize the music is playing. It sets the feeling in a way that enhances the story, never once did I find a kink in the sound that would have lessened my enjoyment. Something that really blew me away was that Shinsekai yori doesn't have a musical opening. Instead, it has one of the best musical endings in all of anime. That is no exaggeration, the EDs for Shinsekai yori are fabulous. \\n\\n\nThe voice actors did an immaculate job. I can't express this enough, the voice actors did so well with this anime. They fit the characters perfectly. \\n\\n\nCharacters (9):\\n\nOften times we see plot driven anime fall short because of the characters in them. It is when we find a set of characters that fit a story perfectly that it really shines. Shinsekai yori has a beautiful cast of characters. You will even find yourself loving to hate the antagonists. As I said earlier, the VAs did so well with the characters that you will never doubt why they are doing what they are doing, or why they feel the way they feel. What actually happens is that you begin to see yourself in them. \\n\\n\nEnjoyment (10): \\n\nI watched all 25 episodes in one go. I believe this anime to be a masterpiece in the best way. The entire show felt tense/dark, and I couldn't help but get sucked in. Yes there are some pacing issues, and there are homosexual themes in 1-2 episodes but that never took away from the enjoyment I experienced watching this anime.",

            "content": "Where is the line drawn between what's morally just and what's misguided conviction? \r\nUnsettling, immersive, mystical and also sadly overlooked. Shinsekai Yori is a gem that has fallen through the cracks of the general populace's graces. Not to say it isn't known but rather it's become degraded and stigmatized by those that resort to petty remarks regarding the infamous episode 8. This in turn impeded many from watching the show and that's a shame. But for those that have given Shinsekai the light of day, it can be said that it's truly an anime worth one's time and its lately garnered praise is proof ofthat. Today I'll try to shed new light on this title, if for no other reason than to encourage a few others to also give it the benefit of the doubt and to see pass the naysayers. For those that do, you'll be gifted with a new anime to remind you why anime as a medium is so remarkable. \\n\\n\r\nBy far the strongest aspect of SY is it's story. Most shows tend to tackle only one aspect and keep that as its focus throughout its duration. It's difficult to tackle several major storylines in a short time period but not only do SY do so, it also manages it with ease. The transition from a show wrapped in mystery to one that deals with human ethics were impeccable and well linked. The first storyline we tackle involves the slow unraveling of the show's lore and the dystopian society our characters are apart of. That alone would be enough to last the shows duration but it took this element and further used it by expanding to the second half of the conflict. Through proper foreshadowing and buildup this was made possible as the mystery, when solved, opened up a new bag of worms that is carried all the way to the show's very last concluding scenes.\\n\r\n  The second part of the show involved the foreshadowed conflict involving the beasts of the land that \"coexist\" with human society by serving them. The beasts of the land known as the Monster Rats can be seen as allegorical representations of forced subservience and mistreatment that plagues mankind. The show leaves their presence unsettling but never resorts to preachy melodrama. With those familiar with Orwell's novel Animal Farm, it becomes easy to draw comparisons in the approach the novel takes with SY in displaying this animosity that humanity is known for. But unlike the novel the conflict is escalated to a grander scale. It isn't the most subtle way to tackle the subject but certainly a one uncommonly used, especially in anime, which further makes the title a rarity. The problem begins with humans and how they mistreat the beast. But it doesn't simply show fear and the inferiority complex brought on by it but also the retaliation caused by being in constant oppression. It's a historical fact the oppression leads to uprising and eventually war, this anime perfectly captures that in its own obscure way. If there was ever an Japanese proverb to sum up what this premise tackled it would be \"a cornered rat will bite the cat\u201d, the \"rat\" further establishing the merits of my aforementioned allegory example. In the end the show forces you to ask the question \"who was right / who was just?\" with its last minute revelation. \\n\\n\r\nIf there was ever an area that needed any improvement it would be here. The animation was very lackluster to say the least and when compared to other shows released around the same time it becomes more apparent BUT where the show lacks in fluid animation it makes up for in highly detailed art and proper color placement. There are many times in the show where contrasting colors, monochromatic scenes and color limitation was used to properly capture and convey the given tone it wanted to represent. May that be with a scene involving only cool darkly tint colors to invoke isolation or that of a sunset that brings on an ominous aura. The people behind these subtle but effective choices show that they're very well versed in their field of work. They worked with their limited budget and through clever lighting and other techniques made most of it's limitations to go unnoticed by the untrained eye. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSimple yet effective. It's amazing what a few soundtracks can do to enhance a show's scenes. The color choice scenes I mentioned above became further heightened when coupled with the music. May that be the beautiful yet bone chilling choir chanting along with booming instruments or the softer long sweeping ones that gives a feeling of dismay and helplessness. Each and every track fell into place with grace and is one that will stick with you long after the credits roll. Also worth noting that the ending is among the best I've had the pleasure of listening to with the intricate guitar composition and well timed vocals. The voice actors were all fine and even tolerable dubbed as well. Standout being John Kaiser's role as Squealer.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the only area of SY that I can find a true qualm with. Despite it's well explored setting and great world building only two characters were given any layered characterization and dimension. The first being our lead Saki as she's the one tossed into the difficult situations and grows as she learns more about the hidden secrets in her society. What makes her great as a lead is that she isn't portrayed as a 1 sided \"fight for what's right\" mouthpiece but rather she understands the need for the  necessary evils. That doesn't mean she doesn't fight against it but she don't act in a way that's pigheaded or irrational. She isn't made out to be someone with stubborn conviction that isn't subjugated to change but is shown as someone who simply wants what's right. She is later developed as the show goes along, making her time on screen one welcomed.\\n\r\nThe other layered character is Satoru as he's a constant companion to her. He doesn't get anything in the way of development as Saki did but he is layered enough that he feels like a person and not a simply a 1 note character. They could of spend more time to flesh him out further but given the show's focus what we got was enough.\\n\r\nThe antagonist for the series isn't layered per say but he becomes the one that forced the viewer to take a second look on the show's overall interpretation. As such his role is fine in the context of the story and adds value to it.\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters don't really have much in terms of layered dimensions as they were never given any prolonged screentime to be flesh out. They were better as a whole than when viewed individually. But what can be noted was how the show handled them. It showed how fragile their mentalities were by the misgivings of their society's social order. The bonds they try to uphold and cling on to can be seen as co-dependence since they can't stand on their own. Something like a mental crutch that adds an interesting dynamic to their relationships. It's handled with a certain nuance which makes up for what they lack as individuals. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nWhen I saw the propaganda surrounding this title floating around the anime community I became one of those people that was hesitant to give the title a try. I had forgotten about it and it wasn't until months later after constant praise that I watched it. If I had any regret it would be not watching it sooner as I hold this title in high regards. I can't recommend it enough. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nShinsekai yori is a title that deserves more acknowledgement, not only is it a tribute to dystopian literature but also one that sets a benchmark for other anime titles to reach for. It is truly a masterfully written tale that is handled with a sense of class and finesse. If given the time of day I'm sure you'll receive something substantial out of it. \\n\\n\r\nFor similar titles I recommend:\\n\\n\r\nShiki: A tale about vampires that follow the same ethical themes brought up in SY. Not as polished in writing but still one worth watching.\\n\\n\r\nSuisei no Gargantia: both contain a plot twist that are identical and answers the same questions regarding perception of morality. Although it isn't handled with the same level care as Shinsekai it's still short enough and easy to watch to recommend giving a try. \\n\\n\r\nWolf's Rain: dystopian-esc setting with discrimination and war, more of a \"road\" anime shrouded in mystery but gives off the familiar aura of the unknown that SY does.",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVEIW**\r\nDuring the Fall season of 2012, animation studio A-1 pictures was airing two anime. One of them was the infamous Sword Art Online; the international sensation that essentially made money faster than it could be printed. It went down in history as one of the most hyperbolized and dramatic popularity explosions of all time. In the wake of the massive tidal wave created by the anti-Christ itself (or the messiah, depending on your perspective), there was another anime; an anime that was swallowed whole by the mainstream hype of the industry. An anime that barely anyone bothered to watch. An anime that nearlyeveryone in its already small audience dropped because of a 10 second yaoi scene in episode 8. An anime that was a complete financial failure. \\n\\n\r\nWhy is this story concerning? I\u2019ll tell you why: because that anime was called \u201cShinsekai Yori\u201d. If the name doesn\u2019t mean anything to you, that\u2019s probably because you haven\u2019t seen it yet. There is little debate that this anime is something special; it has one of the most mature and refined tones in the history of the medium, the music and animation are unbelievably atmospheric, and the world building is absolutely unparalleled. To the anime community, none of that mattered. Shinsekai Yori\u2019s monetary disaster coupled with SAO\u2019s monumental success sent a very clear message to the industry: More SAOs, less Shinsekai Yori\u2019s. *Sigh, this is why I drink. This is also why I write reviews. Ladies and gentlemen: Shinsekai Yori.\\n\\n\r\nSynopsis: One millennium into the future, society exists as a utopia in which every human possesses \u201cthe god\u2019s power\u201d; a form of incredibly powerful psychokinesis. Our protagonist, Saki Watanabe, lives in this utopia that is completely barred from the outside world. However, her and her friends begin to discover some of the dark secrets behind their society as their perfect little reality begins its slow, downward spiral into disaster, as all utopias seem to do.\\n\\n\r\nLet me reiterate something I mentioned earlier; this is a very mature anime. When I say that, I don\u2019t just mean that there\u2019s a lot blood and gore/sexual themes (although those things certainly exist in the show). Rather, I mean to say that you have to be a mature person to enjoy and understand this show. The pacing is very, very slow, there is a LOT of info-dumping, and the show lacks the energy or excitement that you would typically see in a psychological show. Virtually all of Shinsekai Yori\u2019s plot is spent building its vast, unique, fascinating, and disturbing world.  This anime is the absolute pinnacle of world building; arguably the best of all time. The utopia that is the focus of the story can only be described as staggering. The most beautiful thing about the setting isn\u2019t merely its depth, however, but rather the way in which the show\u2019s themes are built so perfectly around it. The implications of the way this society is run and how it began are legitimately shocking, dark and frightening. This anime will almost certainly give you the chills, but it goes beyond just that; it makes you legitimately think. Perhaps the scariest part about the show is that nothing about it is unbelievable. Nothing about it is unreasonable. There are no good guys, there are no bad guys. There is only a group of organisms behaving according to their nature. At the risk of spoiling the plot, I will not go into much depth about the intricacies of this outstanding storyline. Just know that it will leave a serious impact on you; it is easily the highlight of the show.\\n\\n\r\nBecause the main focus of the show is undoubtedly the world building, Shinsekai Yori\u2019s characters don\u2019t receive nearly as much time or attention. However, that certainly doesn\u2019t mean that they aren\u2019t good. Our protagonist, Saki Watanabe, serves as a parallel to the audience\u2019s experience; she learns about the truths of her world at the exact same pace as we do. This makes her extremely relatable and the audience is able to know what she is thinking and what she is feeling at all times. Although some could argue that she (as well as all her friends) merely serves as a medium to explore the setting, the reason I believe that she is a fantastic character is because she is ultimately the one who brings the themes full circle at the end of the anime.  Although she is certainly passive most of the time, it is ultimately her thoughts and actions that hammer in the message of the show. Saki is one of my favorite female characters ever. The supporting cast, however, lacks depth.  While they all have their own basic personalities and motivations, they ultimately just serve as the passive mediums I mentioned earlier, this time without the thematic implications of Saki. They are certainly likeable (I really liked Sataru), but they don\u2019t offer as much as I would have liked them to. Then there are the antagonists (if you can even call them that).  Going into any detail on this matter is a spoiler, but the seemingly evil actions executed throughout the narrative puts the concept of morality itself into question; it makes you legitimately consider what is evil and what is justified. That is the mark of truly fantastic writing.\\n\\n\r\nI also feel the need to mention the superbly surreal presentation of the show. The animation is incredibly crisp and the color pallet is visually appealing, but the artwork stands out in particular for its wide variety of amazing designs.  Every human character has a great design, which is impressive enough, but the show also features a plethora of strange, grotesque, and fascinating creatures. Shinsekai Yori does a fantastic job of coming up with creative appearances for these creatures and making them all memorable. In short, the animation is top notch. The music, on the other hand, really steals the show. This anime has no OP theme, as is tradition, but it instead has one of the greatest ED themes of all time. Some would argue THE best. However, it is the OST that\u2019s the really impressive aspect of the sound; it is absolutely mesmerizing. The potent combination of haunting, spine-tingling pieces and sad, somber pieces combine to form a remarkably large part of the show\u2019s atmospheric and chilling environment.  Also, the voice acting is well above average. Truly a memorable presentation style.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Shinsekai Yori is one of a kind. It chooses to walk the path of a mature, thought provoking, somber tale and never strays from that path. It\u2019s not flashy nor is it particularly exciting, but it certainly is remarkably written. If you ask me, Shinsekai Yori is a masterpiece. You would be hard pressed to find a more fleshed out and imaginative setting in all of fiction; not just in the realm of anime. Needless to say, I highly recommend this show and I\u2019m glad to see that it has gotten the attention is deserves after an initial period of failure.",

            "content": "Shinsekai Yori (From the New World) is something of an eclectic anime series. It's based off a novel, which hands it very different premises compared to anime that are based off manga or games (and for that matter, original anime), which is pretty evident in its characters and story, following few of the bigger anime clich\u00e9s.\r\nMuch can be said about its story and its contents, but at heart it's a big metaphor of growing up, from the utopian-seeming setting in the beginning to the more nuanced view we're treated to later - not as a result of the world changing but as the result ofthe viewer - and the main characters - simply finding out more about the world and how it works, and adapting accordingly. It doesn't just settle with \"children growing up\", however, at every point and turn there's dark revelations and disturbing implications, some of which are never answered but deftly left for the viewer to contemplate, and right up to - and including - the ending, you always feel that something is just... out of place. The setting feels off, but in a good, \"this is disturbingly cool\" kind of way, so while maybe a little uncomfortable, it amplifies the overall mood of the series. Dread is, perhaps, a good word for the sensation.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are treated to a lot of interesting hurdles and obstacles, and it's interesting to see them interact with the world and each other, even if some characters take an unfortunate role as vassals of the story or infodumpers. Even so, the series' focus on karmic elements, the evil of the subconscious and the gnawing effects on those humans left isolated from their peers all serve to further define and contribute to the character dynamic. The latter half, where the pace really picks up, also brings about themes of oppression and supremacy and skillfully manages to instill a sensation of moral gray rather than good and evil. Conflicts are abound, simply put, and challenges the characters in intriguing and often unexpected ways.\\n\\n\r\nAesthetically there is little to hold against the series. The colour palette is lush and the animation fluid. It rarely fails to deliver excellent character designs and animations, and likewise its special effects are lovely indeed. On the auditory side, it delivers a soundtrack that contributes strongly to the perturbing mood of the series. The opening theme is as harrowing as it is good, and the ending theme wrote itself swiftly into my favorite list. The voice acting is overall good, I am especially impressed with newcomers  \\n\\n\r\nTo sum up Shinsekai Yori is hard, but its essence is a dark story about a world where few things are as they seem, that deals with a large host of themes - many more (and no less important) than the ones already mentioned -, set in an aesthetically wonderful world. It adheres to few of the clich\u00e9s and stereotypes of the day, and is that anime that comes along once in a while with a really refreshing concept and story and executes it well. Characterization could have been done a little better, initial pacing maybe too, and some story elements were a little hard to accept, and so on and so forth. Regardless, I can only finish with this: Give Shinsekai a try!",

A-1 Pictures, while known from some of it's notoriously bad series, has really left in me shock on just how they could produce a compelling, unique, and deep story. Along with it's fantastic characters and their development throughout the series, to the sensational and masterpiece soundtracks used, Shinsekai yori manages to do almost every aspect flawlessly. It's an anime that manages to leave viewers reflecting on real world issues with Shinsekai yori's universe and how everything is not all that seems.It tackles on the issues of lust for power, rising against tyrannical governments, morals, beliefs, and psychology of not just humanity itself, but from the other intelligent species living on Earth, and never once did it leave me in boredom throughout the short length of it's 25 episodes run. With all it's praise it supposedly delivered, is Shinsekai yori truly a masterpiece that I would recommend anyone to watch? Is there any aspects about the show that I felt was weak, or tried to execute but not properly?  Like majority of my reviews, I'll be going over the the 6 main points: story, artwork, sound, characters, overall enjoyment, and my summary thoughts with the final verdict. I'll try my best to keep this review completely spoiler free as possible as well, while only covering plot points and scenes from the first episode.\\n\\n\r\n\"We have to change our way of thinking if we really want to change the future.\" - Saki Watanabe\\n\\n\r\nThe most notable and praised element you'll find if someone were to recommend Shinsekai yori is how it handles the story throughout the series. The rich lore and captivating story line will get viewers invested quickly in the show. This could even be done in the very first episode, like it was for me. The idea of an outbreak of Psychokinesis, the ability to manipulate and change matter; whether it's making yourself or objects fly, setting something on fire just by looking at it, killing someone by just staring, is executed very well in the opening scene. We get to know right away what's happening to our present, the fall and destruction of the old world, and the rise of the new world 1000 years later into the future world of Shinsekai yori. From there on, the story follows the perspective and narration of Saki Watanabe, a 12 year old girl who obtains the powers of Psychokinesis, or what they call it now: Cantus. We also get to see how the world 1000 years later is. To our surprise, there's no technological advancements or flying cars to be found, and it looks like society has taken a step backwards by isolating their scarce and fragile communities from one another. This is all due to humans becoming the dominate force of the world, where Cantus is the building foundation of how their society functions. There are also many other species roaming around the planet. The most notable and intelligent ones, the Queerats, are predecessors of the naked mole-rat. They're bipedal, can understand human language, and worship humans as \"gods\" from their Cantus. They have many colonies each ruled by a queen, and some work as slaves for the humans, swearing complete and absolute loyalty. Along with Copy-Cats, supposed cat-like creatures that are rumored to come after human children, and Fiends, humanoid creatures that the elders teach the children about to prevent one from ever coming to the village, are all mentioned briefly in the first episode, but later on explored further into the story, and become very significant plot points.\\n\\n\r\nThe psychological, science-fiction, and supernatural elements all come together to produce a gripping and epic storyline, leaving almost no details or plot-holes behind. The audience at first may not fully grasp the big picture the story is trying to tell you at first, but later on, specifically in episode 4, we get to see how this supposed Utopian society the humans live in is not all it seems. With a very good beginning, an even better middle, and fantastic conclusion to the story (quite possibly the best I've ever seen), it's no surprise to say that the story of Shinsekai yori is nothing more close to a masterpiece that you'll ever find in an anime, and rightfully deserves that title. The art of Shinsekai yori can best be described as being very diverse and unique when it comes to it's artwork. It makes the setting for a world that's taken a step back of any kind of futuristic technology shine brightly. Visuals, the environment, and character models are all breathtaking to look at. There was not one time that I noticed any horrible animation or questionable choice of visuals/colors for a scene. Blending and shading of scenes are also done very well, weak at times, but executed properly. Whether it be the night sky, mountain ranges, forests, buildings, Shinsekai yori delivers quality artwork, a factor not heavily discussed when describing your favorite anime, into a dynamic and awestruck world.\\n\\n\r\nOnly second to the story, the sounds and music that Shinsekai yori produces incorporates the strengths of compelling human emotions with realistic sound design and high class soundtracks to bring life to an engaging story. Every sound; whether it was simply as turning the page of a book, the listening of footsteps through the school, the background noise of wildlife, and the echoing of voices, Shinsekai yori always used sounds appropriately and in a meaningful way to describe what's happening right now. This was the first anime ever that I actually appreciated the different sounds used and how it set up the mood. Simply amazing. The OST tracks were all very unique and memorable to listen to. 'Traditional Song of Shadows', a very commonly used soundtrack in the anime, always gave the feeling of suspense, anxiety, and hype whenever it came on, and was always used in the right situations where the audience was left to feel emotional with the situation at hand. 'History Of Despair, used for compelling and especially suspenseful moments, filled me with emotion while listening, I could actually feel the tension and suspense inside of me. My personal favorite and arguably best soundtrack: 'Wareta Ringo', the ending theme for episodes 1-16, is a masterpiece, and I never once skipped the ending just because of this fantastic song - And I always skip the endings. With greatly used sounds, very well composed soundtracks that'll get you tapping your foot everytime they come on, the sounds for Shinsekai yori is one of the best soundtrack I've ever witnessed in anime, right next to Clannad and Clannad: After Story's soundtrack. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Shinsekai yori, like the rest of the anime, were crafted and thought out beautifully. Character development, dynamic and complex personalities, interesting backstories, and realistic values were presented in the majority of the cast. At the top of my head, I could only think of 2 or 3 characters that may have had wasted potential, but not too many fell under that category. The main characters in Shinsekai yori are all children, so you get to experience they're perspectives in their dystopian society. Saki Watanabe is the main protagonist and narrator of the story. A very outgoing, yet sensitive girl who values her friends, family, and town very dear to herself. She argues a lot with her friend Satoru, and is very close with her two childhood friends Maria and Shun. She has trouble at first with her Cantus, but gradually overcomes it. She is my favorite character, as we get to see her fantastic character development the most. Satoru Asahina is a very observant and intelligent, yet energetic boy who likes to pull pranks and tease Saki a lot. He's a very likable character that at first I did't think much of, but later becomes very significant and important, especially near the middle and ending. Like Satoru, Shun Aonuma is very clever, and the most mature one out of the group. He's the brains at the sage academy with near perfect scores every time. The elders expect great things of him when he reaches adulthood. A pretty complex character, but not nearly as great as Saki and Satoru. Maria Akizuki is Saki's best friend who's the most feminine of the group. She's shown to be protecting and commanding Mamoru, the groups other member a lot. She's remains a pretty static character throughout the length of the series. Mamoru Itou's a very shy, timid boy who rarely expresses his concerns or opinions in the group. He's my least favorite of the main characters, but by no means a bad character. Like Maria, he's also a static character. Squealer is a queerat with very high intelligence, sly, and astute. He is the representative of the Robber Fly colony of queerats. He's my second favorite character, and possibly the most complex and dynamic character of the storyline, with fantastic character development near the ending.\\n\\n\r\nMy experience and enjoyment with Shinsekai yori was nothing like I've ever witnessed before. I've heard praise, mixed opinions, and spite from this anime, so I was going into it without the intent of thinking highly of it at first. But boy, was I completely blown away over how good this anime actually is. Like mentioned above, it just does almost every aspect right. It gets the plot moving smoothly, with making sure the audience knows what's going on through the narration, delivering a fantastic story. It has fantastic artwork and scenery, masterpiece soundtracks and different sounds used to fit the mood and premise of the scene, very well crafted characters who have great character development and important roles, rarely being wasted. This anime will make you think, it'll make you feel sad, happy, emotional, and an array of different feelings while you experience Saki Watanabe's life with her friends in the new world ruled by the super-human ability of Cantus, and how it affects everything around the world, the different species and how they interact with humans, and the government of a supposed utopian society not being all that meets the eye. You will want more after reaching the fantastic conclusion, like I did. \\n\\n\r\nA recommendation to anyone who wants a compelling, dark, psychological story, with all other aspects of characters, sound, artwork, and enjoyment being near perfect in every sense. Shinsekai yori is an anime I'll never forget, and will remain in my top favorites for years to come.",

            "content": "Upon revisiting this anime exactly two months from when I last finished it, (03/31/13) I am reminded of things that I have missed and that is this.\r\nIf there is anything to be said about this anime, it's that it is extremely emotionally draining. With the trivialities of art and aesthetic pleasure aside, this anime is incredibly real with its plot twists and deep themes. With enough analysis, one could make an extremely satisfying paper on the choices of the characters and the moral injustices that may or may not have been present during the series.\r\nSTORY 10/10\r\nStarting off with my initial impression of this anime, Iwould like to say that I knew what was coming (having finished it) but admit that I had no idea what the hell I was in store for when I watched that first episode. Did I expect this to be a happy-go-lucky anime? No. Did I expect this anime to be abundant with extremely dark materials? No. Did I expect a lot of the things that happened? No.\\n\\n\r\nThe truth is, all of the events that transpired made sense in the end, and that many of what seem to have been irrational decisions were not without reasoning behind them. The story is so complex and ripe with plot layers that it's hard to comprehend many of the actions that the characters devoted themselves to.\\n\\n\r\nWhich is why I would give the story a rating of 10. It was incredibly well done and, though it may seem naive to rate it such high a score, I believe that it deserves the effort that was placed into it in order to lead us into a state of enlightenment at the end.\\n\\n\r\nART 9/10\\n\r\nAs touched upon very briefly during the intro paragraph, I mentioned that the aesthetic appeal was none too great in this series. And although many viewers would be put off by this \"more realistic approach\" to an anime that is quite newly finished, I would like to state that it was self-evident that the art helped itself rather well. With a more human approach to anime, Shinsekai Yori did a fantastic job portraying humans in their own habitat. \\n\\n\r\nWhich is why I gave it a 9. Not incredibly pleasing in an aesthetic manner, but did work quite well in order to provide a more realistic approach to modern day anime.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND 9/10\\n\r\nDvorak, need I say more? Being an avid follower of classical music, \"Largo\" (aka, Going Home) from \"From the New World\" by Antonin Dvorak is a beautiful piece that is visited in much of its glory. Playing the part of one of the main themes of Shinsekai Yori, I was quite disappointed to see that not much of the rest of the movements of this said piece was shown. Otherwise, the sound was superbly done, with amazing ending songs and a dramatic opening tune that always nicely introduced the episode.\\n\\n\r\nSo, well, 9. There could have been much more variation of songs, but otherwise the sound aspect of this anime wasn't very crucial in understanding the major themes and plot. Well done, and an extra point for Dvorak.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER 10/10\\n\r\nI could write an entire essay on the analysis of these characters. With that being said, I leave much of the judgement up to you, as the main individuals of this anime were incredibly well-written and developed. Though antagonists or protagonists weren't very clear, I would have to say that this aspect made many of the characters more believable, as no individual can always be extremely good or extremely evil.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in the story made extremely practical decisions based on their situations and acted very maturely in certain predicaments despite their age. \\n\\n\r\nBravo, indeed, for the characters. Bravo. 11 if I could, but I can't.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT 8/10\\n\r\nThis was obviously an extreme displeasure to finish. As explained prior, this was an extremely draining anime that I took much time and deliberation to finish. Breaking down before the half-way point of the story, I could not find myself enjoying this anime but continued for all the other rewarding aspects. I think that I enjoyed it, but am unsure due to my feelings for the overall perspective on this anime. It was wonderfully done and I enjoyed it.\\n\\n\r\nI simply wish I could have enjoyed it more. Sorry, 8.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL 10/10\\n\r\nThis is the TL;DR part. Damn it, if there's going to be something you're going to not regret watching this entire freaking year, it's got to be this anime. Rich with make-believe history and moral lessons (as well as absolutely satisfying characters), this anime has made it to the top of my list of favorite anime. Just watch at your own caution and know what you're getting into. Much content in this anime is suggestive but all leads to an established point. Watch it, and you'll be smarter having finished it. Cheers, and enjoy.",

            "content": "When I first heard about Shinsekai Yori, I was only slightly interested due to the somewhat lack-luster description of the series that was on the chart I viewed before the series aired. However, as I began to watch it, Shinsekai Yori quickly drew me into its universe, immersed me in the art and the lore, and become one of my favorite anime of all time.\r\nThe story of Shinsekai Yori is experienced through the eyes of the main protagonist, Watanabe Saki, as she grows from childhood to adulthood, making it a partially autobiographical experience as an older version of Saki voices parts with narrative. Set onethousand years in the future where almost every human has developed psychic powers called Cantus, the world of Shinsekai Yori is full of both the familiar and unfamiliar. While the humans all look relatively the same as what you could find today in areas, the other denizens of the world are much different from what you would see now. The first episode immediately establishes who should be watching the anime as people get instantaneously squished and torn to shreds in flashes of blood in what would seem to be present-day Japan however, it then quickly shifts to where and when the main story actually takes place. From the first episode alone, it is immediately apparent that something is clearly amiss in the quiet life of Saki's village and the story plays off this sense of mystery. While watching, I never felt that I was left out of the loop on the lore or what was currently happening; the story is paced well so that you basically know everything that Saki knows, and, at times, it isn't really all that much. I felt some sort of connection to the protagonist, Saki, as she journeyed and strove to know the truth in the world she lives in. Much like her, with the passing of daily life and with only one episode airing per week, I gradually began to forget some of the same things that Saki did, almost like the creators actually desired this effect. In short, this show will test your memory. While you don't have to remember absolutely everything to enjoy the story as there are plenty of twists and turns, you will probably miss out on some subtle hints that are dropped by the characters as they talk. Shinsekai Yori is definitely worth rewatching purely to see how all the pieces fit together after you've experienced it once already. Another thing that is worth mentioning is that the next-episode previews of Shinsekai Yori are probably the best I have ever seen, revealing just enough to make me make me wish the for the next episode to come faster, yet not spoiling too much in the process. However, though I always ached for the next episode to come faster, there was a certain \u201chump\u201d in the story in the first few episodes that was particularly dull but, after you got over said \u201chump\u201d, it was smooth sailing from then out and I felt the ending was particularly satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nIf the art of Shinsekai Yori were to be summed up in one word, \u201camazing\u201d. I found that the art style itself is unique and very polarizing. The humans have a somewhat \u201cbland\u201d look to them in comparison to everything else in the anime, mostly because they look \u201cnormal\u201d. The background art can be absolutely stunning at times and the creatures often look grotesque and revolting, which is why I say the humans look \u201cnormal\u201d or \u201cbland\u201d in comparison. The creatures are supposed to look that way and, in all seriousness, the fictional depiction of a \u201cFiend\u201d gives me the chills every time I see it. The animation isn't necessarily the best and while there were parts that could have been better, those are minor and somewhat rare. Although there aren't too many major scenes with crazy animations, there are often small and subtle animations that play a part in the overall story or character interactions, and small stuff like that tends to go a long way in my eyes. All in all, despite the animation not being the greatest, the art in Shinsekai Yori is definitely worthy of an experience that only blu-rays could offer.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound design in Shinsekai Yori isn't so much to create an epic soundtrack as it is to create music that fits the mood, and it does so perfectly. The background music is generally dark, mysterious, mellow, or any combination of the three and while there are certain tracks that stray far from this trend, never once did I feel that the music was intrusive. As I am a proponent of a proper use of silence, or a \u201clack of music\u201d, I must say that Shinsekai Yori pulls off those moments well. In fact, it was due to those moments that Shinsekai Yori became the first anime I have watched where I legitimately felt scared during an episode; there are definitely parts in the series that are meant to instill fear. Mood-setting and silence aside, it is notable to mention that Shinsekai Yori does not have an opening theme at all but rather only has two ending themes. The first ending theme, \u201cWareta Ringo\u201d by Taneda Risa, is possibly my favorite ending theme song from the Fall 2012 and Winter 2013 seasons (the time span which Shinsekai Yori aired) and the second ending theme, \u201cYuki no Saku Hana\u201d by Hanazawa Kana, is good as well, though it definitely gives off a more melancholic feel than the first ending theme.\\n\\n\r\nSo, just to get this out of the way, yes there is homosexuality (both male and female) in this anime, however, it is not prevalent throughout the series and I thought it was taken in a mature and logical way, reflecting the ideals and culture of the anime's society. Homosexuality in Shinsekai Yori can be surmised as such: homosexuality is accepted and it is perfectly okay to love whoever you love but, at the end of the day, homosexual couples often split up to pair with partners of opposite gender because they cannot reproduce otherwise and therefore cannot further the human race but, their love for one another often stays. Although the characters are all psychics, most with the power to wipe out entire armies if they wished, none of the characters ever seemed inhuman- with some exceptions. They laugh, cry, discuss societal issues, and develop strategies, some of which are fairly brilliant. I love how human everyone in the series is but, the ironic thing is that my favorite character isn't even human. While I won't go too much into detail as it is somewhat of a spoiler, he is the ideal warrior in every way, shape, and form and, in my opinion, is a character who demands respect. As far as character development goes, the most major developments happen on-screen while other minor developments happen off-screen. This is mostly due to the nature of the series; Shinsekai Yori tends not to waste your time on the worthless everyday activities that the characters do (except in the beginning), instead using time-skips to get to the parts that are actually important. These time-skips are done in a way such that it doesn't seem like anything major changes about the characters other than appearance, and even then, the characters are all easily recognizable. There are only two personal gripes I had with the characters. The first how Saki acts near the end of the anime- though, in all honesty, it's completely understandable given what she goes through over the course of the series. The second is what truly happens to certain characters, specifically to the ones whose ultimate fates are implied throughout the latter parts of the story but you never actually know for sure (some of you who have already watched the series will probably know who I'm taking about).\\n\\n\r\nDespite the \u201chump\u201d in the story-telling in the beginning and minor, personal gripes near the end, I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of Shinsekai Yori. Every new moment provided either new insight into the universe, characters, or story and there were plenty of twists and tense moments to keep your eyes glued to the screen and keep you on the edge of your seat. The art provides some absolutely gorgeous visuals at times and the soundtrack will provide the correct atmosphere for each scene without taking away from it. I felt connected to the characters, shared both their happiness and pain, and never felt alienated from them. In short, I absolutely loved Shinsekai Yori. After each episode I groaned \u201cMan, why can't the next episode be out already?\u201d Shinsekai Yori is a masterpiece of story-telling and definitely worth recommending to anybody as long as they can appreciate the mature themes the anime tackles.\\n\\n\r\n10 out 10",

            "content": "Rewind back to the dawn of fall 2012, you are looking at the fall 2012 anime chart, and you pick probably 5-7 anime you are going to watch. But I can promise that the majority of you, as did I, most likely did not have Shinsekai Yori as a pick. During midst of 2013 I looked at Shinsekai Yori, the promotional picture did not catch my eye and the premises did not spark my interests. However, I did give it a shot and after finishing the anime I can promise that it is truly a spectacle, a diamond in the ruff.\r\nThe story takes place inJapan a thousand years from the present in a utopia where a portion of the population retain a special power called psychokinesis. From the beginning we follow a group of five children as they grow up in the anime and see how they develop within a community bounded by strict rules, and deal with the decisions they make that alter the course of their lives and the entire society they live in. The plot of the show flows very nicely from episode to episode and just as we approach the climax, there\u2019s a plot twist and the storyline from that point just flips upside down in a way you would never expect it to. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime are just something else, with Saki as it\u2019s shining star. The main characters start off as children and by the end of the anime they are adults, with proper illustration of character development. There are a couple of anime who have attempted this children to adulthood metamorphosis motif within one season but they do not pull it off as well as Shinsekai Yori. With an anime that has twenty-five episodes, you would think it would not be enough time for proper character development from children to adults. However, Shinsekai Yori pulls this off very smoothly, which is evidently seen with Saki and Satoru, which even applies to the supporting characters as well. You will not see one character behaving as such and then the next episode they are being the polar opposite, everything is explained and shown very well.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is one of the areas this anime excels in. Every sound that you would not even care for is implemented in every episode and added in the appropriate places, at the appropriate times; the echoing of the voices in a dim room, the rippling of water flowing from a stream. Not to mention soundtrack produced in this amine, which is amazing. Just youtube the battle theme, even if you have not watched the anime yet, it will entice your interests in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe quality of the art and the animation is what you would expect of any anime standards that are out there today: clear, crisp and pleasing to the eye. The characters and the environment in each of the scenes are drawn to a level of detail, not too simple, yet not to far in detail as well, just in the middle. The quality of art really makes you focus on the message the anime is trying to radiate to the viewer; more than focusing of the wow factor on how amazing the art is. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of the enjoyment, this is not an anime that starts off on a high note and continues as such from there. The first two or three episodes really butters you up, but once you hit the fourth or fifth episode, I promise you, you will be hooked and you will just watch one episode after another. Even if you are more into romance, comedy, action or any genre that is not related to Shinsekai Yori, this anime is definitely worth watching and will probably open the doors to other anime series you never bothered to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I really enjoyed this anime, people should give it a try (unexpectedly, it even became one of my favourites). It did not look appealing to me at first, hence \u201cdiamond in the ruff\u201d, but once I started and things picked up, I just wrapped myself in a blanket and marathon\u2019d the whole show. Just looking back at the anime, I will say that one of the highlights of this show is it's ability to take the morals and values of the world we live in and put it into perspective from watching what the characters do to each other and the outcomes that blossom from their decisions. Give Shinsekai Yori a try and you will see what I mean!\\n\\n\r\nI hope you enjoyed my seemingly short review, I would not mind any feedback and if you enjoyed this series or feel enticed to watch it after reading this, feel free to leave a comment !\\n",

            "content": "Little inspection into the dystopia genre is required to realise that the majority of the dystopic anime are set in a cyberpunk universe. Be it Psycho Pass, Ergo Proxy or Texhnolyze, the average viewer is likely to have seen these \"hi-tech\" interpretations of future societies. Enter Shinsekai Yori \u2013 a series where whose setting is uncannily quaint such that on first glance, it is hard to see it as a dystopia; but it is, and an exceptionally remarkable one indeed.\r\n\tWhat distinguishes Shinsekai Yori from its counterparts is the sheer unorthodoxy of its universe. It is one wherethe modern society as we know it has not been replaced by a technologically advanced civilisation but that of a small picturesque town characterised by a community whose lifestyles have regressed into that of villagers. It is within these bounds that we follow our protagonists from the ages of 12 to 26 in this insidiously deceptive world. Throughout the series, Shinsekai Yori\u2019s universe is constantly developed with fascinating conceptions such as the Karma Demons, Cantus and the Queerats (an entirely different yet intelligent species) that all bring into question many of our humanity\u2019s morals and beliefs. Each concept is thoroughly explored and reinforce each other to create a powerful and fascinating dystopia whose elements successfully examines and challenges the philosophies we take for granted.\\n\\n\r\n        Despite its complexity, it does not lazily \u201cnarrate\u201d the ideologies that we question. You won't be sitting through monologues of lecture-like philosophy or psychology. You see society being critiqued through the journey and consequences of the actions of our protagonists. This is what I find to be the most impressive aspect of the show because Shinsekai Yori fully takes advantage of anime as a medium - a feat that I feel is rare in this genre. The characters' dialogue exist to explore their mind whilst it is their actions and interactions with this post-apocalyptic world that we explore humanity. In order to truly appreciate Shinsekai Yori, it has to be completed as only then will the experience be complete as the show's construction of its world is careful to convey certain messages and hidden meanings throughout the show allowing viewers to formulate and reformulate key ideas and questions without ever stooping to overbearing narration.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe characters in Shinsekai Yori all play crucial elements to our story and the range of our cast fully captures the countless perspectives that people in such a world can hold. They are all effectively portrayed via their interactions which unravels how multi-dimensional they are. These interactions are genuine and there is an excellent balance between dialogue, silence and narration from our female lead Saki whose voice actor must be praised for such an alluring performance. Despite the show\u2019s timespan ranging from our protagonists\u2019 youth to their adulthood, the pacing is impeccable as it changes from a slower pace to accommodate the universe-building to a faster pace needed to match the gravity of the conflicts that occur. \\n\\n\r\n\tFor an immense dystopia, it only makes sense for it to be accompanied with diverse artwork. As we observe their world throughout the seasons and its numerous settings \u2013 oceans, mountains, villages both desolate and populated, they are portrayed with their own unique environment and colour choices. This is all contrasted with the use of experimental visuals and cinematography during the more dream-like and ethereal scenes which do not exist to simply invoke awe but contribute to subtly send hints across to the viewer on certain mysteries and foreshadowing certain events. Complementing the visuals is a soundtrack which encapsulates the essence of the show with each track strengthening the visuals and enhancing the overall experience. The soundtrack demonstrates how effectively music can make emotions across the human spectrum more compelling whilst respecting its role of being a supplement to the show and thus maintains our focus on the story the series presents - one which no extent of audiovisuals is required to make its ideas any more resounding than they already are.\\n\\n\r\n\t All in all, Shinsekai Yori is a series that delivers in every single aspect it aims to explore. It displays enough to connect all the ideas examined together into a singular full dystopia but leaves enough for viewers to intellectually ponder and elaborate for themselves. It is profound yet not pretentious and examines humanity without falling into a safety net of tropes that may suffice the viewer but do not inspire. Unlike many of its counterparts, Shinsekai Yori is not a dystopia that relies on a singular premise but a whole host of powerful conceptions that coalesce to create, not just a society, but an entire universe. It achieves this with excellence and elegantly provides us with the most wholesome and meticulously crafted package of dystopian fiction I have ever seen and I unhesitatingly recommend it to anyone who seeks the same.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "\u201cWe ultimately fear what spawns from within us.\u201d\r\nShinsekai Yori was that show where I could sit in awe watching the director roll out things one after the other making it look so very effortless. As a matter of fact, I wouldn't bat an eye if the writer actually happens to be from the future because his description of the \u2018New World\u2019 is not only persuasive but also connected.\r\nThe story is set in the future [1000 years from now] where mankind has created themselves an utopia, though the events are restricted to only Japan. It follows the students of a certain batch in a certain schoolthat helps the students master their PK[Psychokinesis] ability aka Cantus. In this period, PK users[humans] are the dominant species and Queerats are their sub-ordinates or slaves and often address the former as Kami-sama[literally translating as 'God']. We follow Watanabe Saki and her friends through the sufferings and pain they endure as they try to unravel the origin and possibly vile past of their present society. \\n\\n\r\nThe synopsis and the first episode speaks a little to nothing about what the anime truly aims to deliver but the intro of 1 minute[First episode] was enough to keep me reeled in. Fourth episode was bewildering, I had to watch it twice to get most of what was being explained. There was also a portion that temporarily lost my attention and then there was the conclusion that meticulously sealed off the deal on this beautiful creation.\\n\\n\r\nFantasy toned genres never piqued much of my interest but the whole future setting here was surprisingly compelling. Even the plot holes get over shadowed by an unbelievably smooth story transition. One could almost relate our world with the ugly facade put up by the otherwise apparent dystopia. I am deliberately refraining from describing the story but I assure you it's a staggering watch indeed. Whenever I thought- this is it, this is the writer\u2019s limit of imagination, the show would prove me wrong. This is not purely SF or Fantasy, bring in a darker theme, an ingenious screenplay and Shinsekai Yori is born. \\n\\n\r\nShinsekai Yori does contain violence/blood and profanity saturated at some parts of the show. The happenings and revelations in this series can be depressing hence should not be mistaken as a light watch. Shinsekai Yori impressively manages to portray the discriminatory nature in us humans in a completely unorthodox thought provoking manner. Story becomes pretty linear after 6th or 7th episode, but that doesn't stop it from keeping you at the edge of your seat especially near the end. I still can't commend the writer enough for the conclusion he\u2019s given to this work. Best possible ending, as far as it concerns me.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the Homosexual sequences[very little amount of Shounen Ai and perhaps a little Shoujo Ai/Yuri, 1-2 Episodes tops], it saddens me deeply to see people dropping Shinsekai Yori because of the same. I believe they play a tiny yet essential part in describing the re-casted lives of humans of their time and do not qualify enough for a reason to drop this series.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs can be hard to get used to for many, but I've come to realize how much it suits the whole 'Shinsekai' module of the show. A1 pictures out stood themselves again in the Backgrounds Dept. The backgrounds are extremely gorgeous to look at; effects and animation are well above mediocre. Just wow to all the creatures we encounter other than humans and queerats. The color selection fit perfectly and beautifully brings the New World concept to life. Indubitably deserves to be watched in 720p or more.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in their entirety do a great job in painting the manufactured mentality and traits native to the people 1000 years from now. You'll doubt their authenticity, their feelings, pity their helpless state and still be able to relate to a degree, for they are at core still humans like us. Again, this is something that the viewers should see for themselves. [ Queerats : If you're familiar with Harry Potter franchise, Queerats look similar to Dobby, but more disfigured and fat with further diversities as well. Squealer is one of those queerats and plays a significant role in the later half yet main plot of Shinsekai Yori by assuming the personification of 'Resistance' against the atrocities of the Powerful. ]\\n\\n\r\nSound- Bravo! It blends so well into the setting and environment that I couldn't help being mesmerized by it. The BGMs & OSTs were captivating and spot on almost entirely. A custom version of \u2018Going Home\u2019 [adapted from the second movement of Symphony No. 9 (Dvo\u0159\u00e1k)] featured earlier in Mawaru Penguindrum was used in Shinsekai Yori, and for me it worked magic in the latter. I remember watching the first episode again and again just to hear that and the first ED 'Wareta Ringo'. Voice actors did an incredible job, I don't know how but Hanazawa Kana-san's voice always gets me.\\n\\n\r\nI personally enjoyed Shinsekai Yori way more than I'd initially expected. The entire run had a consistent dark atmosphere, which contributed in keeping the tension. I haven\u2019t been this satisfied with an ending in a long time. This is unquestionably a rare gem among the current trend in Japanese animation industry and is not something one should overlook. Sure there are downfalls like the slow pace in initial episodes, few dry episodes in the middle, minuscule amount of homosexual themes that can irrationally put some viewers off, perhaps some sloppy facial animation now and then, but in the bigger picture Shinsekai Yori more than makes up for the flaws and to me it's no less than something close to masterpiece. \\n\r\nThat being said, Shinsekai Yori is not a show for everyone but do try it and decide for yourself.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 8.5/10.\\n\r\n_________________________________________________________\\n\r\nThank you for reading the entire heap. Feedback greatly appreciated.",

            "content": "Shinsekai yori is truly a great series. I've been wanting to write this review for a long time but I decided to wait until the series finished to do so as to write an accurate and coherent review as possible. After 6 months and 25 wonderful episodes, here it is. I will do my best to keep this review spoiler free. \r\nAdapted of the novel by Kishi Y\u016bsuke, Shinsekai Yori tells a story of a civilisation set one thousand years in the future. Mankind has evolved into beings capable of a obscure power known as \"Juryoku\" or Cantus, a powerful psychic power that makes theimpossible possible. In this new world, Man has neither need nor want for technology and reigns supreme over the New World's indigenous species called Bakenezumi and other new organisms we come across as the story unfolds. All seems well and peaceful in the Utopia man has created for itself, however, as our main characters learn early on in the story, Man's evolution came at a price and the New World's mysterious history is written in blood and hidden in secrecy.\\n\\n\r\nInterestingly enough, this series, despite its utter brilliance across the board, has been overlooked by many and is appreciated by few, which is unfortunate as this underrated gem outshines any other series of its season by far in terms of story, characters and execution. Not only is the story of Shinsekai yori highly ambitious, it is intelligent and thought provoking in many ways. Each episode, especially after episode 4, is both thrilling and captivating to the point you simply would not, or better yet, could not view this series one episode one at a time if you had the option not to.\\n\\n\r\nDespite its initial appearance, Shinsekai yori is most definitely not a show for kids; be prepared for a lot of death and gore, deceit and some adult themes. The story requires a great deal of critical thinking to coherently understand and appreciate the narrative. I found myself confused several times early on in the series though the plot later on becomes more linear and thus easier to comprehend. Shinsekai yori is a story that addresses inequality and the flaws of the human condition. It shows us the sinister side of absolute control, the price of secrecy and the perils of curiosity. Undoubtedly, Shinsekai yori tells an intense and utterly satisfying story that will leave you on the edge of your seat and wanting more with each passing episode. The characters featured, both the humans and the Bakenezumi are both compelling and likeable. The main characters prove to be intelligent and very inquisitive but are far from perfect as each have intriguing characteristics that defines them with such subtlety and grace I must commend the author, Kishi Y\u016bsuke, for weaving their personas into the story without making it overly obvious and distracting from the plot. It is my fear that diving in any further in the story and characters would simply ruin the experience and thus I will leave it at that.\\n\\n\r\nIt may interest you that the title name of Shinsekai yori, From the New World in English, was taken from famous Czech composer Antonin Dvorak's Ninth Symphony, written in 1893. I find this to be incredibly fitting as we find out the world set a thousand years in the future is indeed a New World in its own right.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on, the art is somewhat unusual but fitting for an unusual story, more so than any other art style I can think of. Though not much attention is given to detail as far as facial characteristics go, it beautifully depicts the scenery and maintains an overall cleanliness to it anyone ought to be able to appreciate. Truly, it is beyond my ability to describe the fascinating world of Shinsekai yori but I would wager it is unlike anything you have likely seen; before. A1 Pictures has done this series justice in its world building, using just the right colours and shading to create a perfect blend that is both visually pleasing for the average viewer and stays true to the story's setting. The studio has done an above average job the majority of the time with the animation, slipping up only occasionally and consistently producing quality episodes. It is worth nothing that there are some scenes - quite a few actually, that are absolutely breath taking in their beauty. And of course this is only augmented by the angelic scores that play at just the right time, at just the right pitch to deliver a powerful trifecta performance of story, art and sound in an astonishing meld.\\n\\n\r\nI absolutely enjoyed this series. For 6 months this was the one show I looked forward to the most on a regular basis. While it may have a slow start, after the first three episodes the story takes an sharp turn into awesomeness and intensity comparable to a thriller movie. Having said that, there is something to be said for lack of closure on a rather important element in the story towards the end, which unfortunately is left up to the viewer's imagination and some other nuances, but aside from that, it was overall very satisfying and well worth the watch.\\n\\n\r\nWhile not perfect, Shinsekai yori still remains a masterpiece in my eyes, and so my final score is a 10 out 10.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 10\\n\r\nArt - 9\\n\r\nSound - 10\\n\r\nCharacters - 10\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\r\nOverall - 10",

            "content": "In recent years, many series have found success by centering themselves upon flagrant fanservice and fast-paced action. Shinsekai Yori, however, is the antithesis of this trend. \r\nBefore beginning the series, you should be warned\u2014 Shinsekai Yori is not a light watch. This is not the kind of anime that will provide laughter and cheap entertainment. It is an anime that requires the viewer to think and analyze in order to fully enjoy the story. As a result it can be a difficult show for some viewers to get into, but what it provides instead is an experience with far more weight and meaning. \r\nSet inthe distant future, Shinsekai Yori depicts a world ruled by humans with psychic abilities. Using their \"Cantus\", these individuals have the power to meld their thoughts with the outside world. Whether for building, crafting, entertainment, or defense against animals and monstrosities, there are a myriad of ways for Cantus to benefit society. But there are also hidden truths surrounding it. Horrors and conspiracies that will threaten the life of any who uncover them. For Saki and the other members Zenjin Academy's 'Group One', this is a danger that they lamentably fall victim to. \\n\\n\r\nDespite the dark, foreboding tone set from the beginning, it's not until the group uncovers a secret on their school trip that everything starts to go dreadfully wrong for them. Disappearances, assassinations, and invincible beasts aptly called 'Fiends' are but a handful of the mysteries revealed to Saki and her friends. Society is evidently not the utopia that it seems.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is primarily conveyed through the perspective of Saki, but rather than focus on each character individually, Shinsekai Yori instead centers around interpersonal characterization. Group One is often treated as its own character due to the five's inseparable friendship, and this friendship itself serves as one of the core themes of the story. Gradually and together they mature from the naive children that they were at the beginning of the story, directly as a result of their relationships with others. However, do not be misled: this is not an anime about its characters. It is first and foremost a story about the mysteries and conflict that they find themselves pulled into. \\n\\n\r\nAdding to the main cast is an astute race of bipedal mole rats, referred to by humans as \"Queerats\". Despite having intelligence nearly equal to that of humans, they are oppressed and treated as little more than the animals they have evolved from. Understandably they are not pleased with this. Instigating the inevitable rebellion is the Robert Fly colony, led by the machiavellian leader \"Squealer\". His presence serves to create a deeper sense of conflict in the story, but he is also one of the more well-written antagonists in recent years. He is not motivated by tropes such as madness or greed but by a deep sense of loyalty to his people. It's interesting how none of his actions can be defined as inherently 'good' or 'evil', and it makes one wonder if he might have been the hero instead if the story was told from a different perspective. \\n\\n\r\nSuch themes are not uncommon in Shinsekai Yori. Rather than presenting its story through black and white reasoning, there is instead an abundance of pertinent ethical questions posed to the viewer. Does the end justify the means? Do the same rights as humans apply to animals, and what truly sets humanity above them if not intelligence? Complex topics such as the human condition are also explored in detail and the story is not afraid to portray loss and death in a frank manner. This is an anime that's meant to be analyzed and it rewards the viewer for doing so. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the strongest aspects of Shinsekai Yori is its atmosphere. Throughout every episode exists an overbearing sense of dread and melancholy: the feeling that something very bad is about to happen, and indeed it often does. The pacing is also very much on the slow side, with several expository episodes before the story finally takes off, but once it does it becomes very difficult to stop watching. Shinsekai Yori is a macabre, sometimes uncomfortable story that will succeed in immersing you in its dark atmosphere. There's nothing else quite like it out there, which makes it an especially enticing experience. \\n\\n\r\nAs if to defy the conventions of mainstream anime, sexuality plays an important role in the story. The main characters are not innocent and devoid of sexual feelings, even despite their young age in the first two arcs. Much like us, they fall in love, experiment and desire to act out on their feelings. They are not restrained by otaku concepts such as 'purity', and this is an immense benefit given the mature tone of the series. One further thing to note is that they do not only express romantic and sexual desires towards the opposite sex\u2014 but towards the same sex as well. \\n\\n\r\nThough one has to wonder why this created so much controversy. Even if the viewer finds bisexual interactions to be uncomfortable, there is scarcely a scene that displays such behavior in the first place. These relationships are not used for superficial shounen-ai or shoujo-ai appeal, but are instead there to reflect the characters maturing in a society unconstrained by social stigma. The most conspicuous of these few scenes is during the ninth episode, when two male characters play on the grass and then kiss for five or ten seconds. Why did such a trivial scene disturb some people so much? It's hard to say.\\n\\n\r\nThere are certainly legitimate criticisms to be had towards the series, though. In particular, the first few episodes are filled with expository dialogue which oftentimes amount to infodump. Granted, this is necessary to give the viewer a proper understanding of the setting and the rules which the characters live by, but there is no doubt a more elegant approach that could have been employed here instead. Further problems also exist within the two timeskips of the story, as it will abruptly change with no transition between past and present. This is especially an issue in the second timeskip, where twelve entire years are passed in the blink of an eye. We also see very little character growth in that time, which is quite odd, to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nBut these flaws are more than made up for by the sound design. A quality soundtrack in anime is often treated as an afterthought more than anything else, but Shinsekai Yori is one that understands the value that a good score can have. The music here is largely composed of haunting choir melodies, percussion, and ambient noises which serve to heighten the tension and atmosphere of their respective scenes. There's one particular song in the anime, usually used during the beginning of an episode, which was able to send chills down my spine each time it played. Now, this is the sign of a powerful score\u2014 having the ability to evoke emotion through music instead of drama. It would hardly be an exaggeration to say that the soundtrack is Shinsekai Yori's greatest strength, and that is not a statement that comes with little weight. \\n\\n\r\nThe art also compliments the tone of the anime quite well. Dark shadows accentuate the gloomy atmosphere of the story while thick lines are used to emphasize the characters and their facial expressions. There is a lack of polish, though, with regards to detail and animation quality, but you can hardly fault an anime for not being granted a lavish budget. Shinsekai Yori fortunately makes the very most of its modest budget, and its art quality manages to compete with some of the more mainstream titles to boot.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are looking for something unique in an era defined by generic rom-coms and ecchi titles, then this is an anime that will likely fill your appetite. Sure, it may not be a flawless triumph that will be remembered until the ends of time, but as one of the better anime in the past few years, it is well worth your time to give it a try. You would be hard-pressed to find anything else like it.",

            "content": "Fear, Loss, Hope and Betrayal. Desire, Strength, Lies, and Perfection. If only Shinsekai Yori could be described with just these few words. You rarely see an anime that blends the Story, Art, Sound, and the growth of Characters so fluently. Its not simple to achieve this level of artistry. As a result, it\u2019s not a simple story to watch. Your constantly given questions till the very end. However this makes the anime incredibly enjoyable to watch. It feels as though your brought closer into the story because of it. This Dark masterpiece questions humanities desires, darkens the line that separates Children form Adults, and presentsa twisted morality as the cost for power. While never losing hope of a better future.\\n\\n\r\nWith 1000 years passing society has been shattered through the evolution of humanity. Humans awakening of Cantus/Pk, proved to be unruly. As the episodes progress more of the timeline preceding the present is reviled. As shocking as the past appears, sadly its not an unrealistic possibility given the chaos created through Cantus, and the nature of humanity. \\n\\n\r\nThe setting is placed in what appears from afar as a utopia. Vast flora surrounds a seemingly tranquil town. While flowing stream\u2019s cascade into waterways, connecting lands of mystery and wonder. The setting is very breathtaking, although its only the contour of the story. Strongly influenced by the lives and minds of the 5 children in Group One at Sage Academy, a school for teaching children how to use and control their Cantus. The story follows them from age 12 to 26. The main cast is incredibly realistic, often making believable choices and appearing very \u201chuman\". However they feel distant, as far as becoming attached to them. I thought personally while they each had their moments of brilliance, they struggled to break away from simply, appearing \u201cnormal\u201d (Looking past their Cantus of course). Although the cast overall, portray\u2019s friendship and conflict, in a fashion that is easily some of the best writing I\u2019ve seen. Personally I loved having the narration told by Saki Watanabe, I felt an allure about her through out the story. Hearing her reflect thoughts on her past at times, while also watching her own life mature, created a beautiful temperament. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed that almost immediately there is a sense of danger placed into the story. Its not direct at first, but by using stories told by children, it makes for a intriguing prelim. The plot is paced extremely well, allowing for proper character development, (which there is a lot of), and story progression to mature simultaneously. At times it may feel that a lot is explained at once. So don\u2019t be afraid to re-watch a section if you think you missed something. Its difficult to review the story with out touching on spoilers. There are so many details intertwined together, to create a perfectly flowing story. It takes adventurous children, turned rebellious teens, and finally determined young adults. Mix\u2019s in a beastly, yet sadly relatable conflict. This being the sub species Queerats relation with the Humans. While using realistic context, the story also ties in romance and desire. Along with unique ideas such as, Cantus Leakage, Karma Demons, and Fiends. When you put it all together it creates a wonderful story. That with each episode continues to impress. \\n\\n\r\nYour taken into this vast world filled with deep colors, blurring reality and fantasy effortlessly at times. The characters are drawn with detail and look very appropriate. I thought each character had a fitting appearance to portray their personality. Although their design consistency, wavers now and then unfortunately. Some details vary depending on the Key animator, working with that episode. Also a few minor animation effects, such as awkward amounts of arrows. Feel out of place but are easily forgotten by the end. Overall the shadows and colors are always vivid. While the art tone maintains a darker look. The entire story resonates to eclipse the viewer into and different but familiar world. Reflecting rivers and warped realities, the mysterious fauna seen throughout the story. All the Art elements together, create a perfect tint for the clandestine theme in Shinsekai Yori. \\n\\n\r\nWith music generally maintaining a serious tone, Shinsekai Yori has an incredible soundtrack. Traditional Song of Shadows, Ienikaeru (Going Home), History of Sorrow, Last Letter. They are all such moving pieces and there are so many more. The themes and scenery are portrayed wonderfully though the music, making it all very chilling. It seemed to me that appropriate score\u2019s are often used as an introduction, in place of a opening sequence. It was a wonderful choice for the story, because of the absence of a typical OP, the show maintains more of it's mystery. The voice acting is excellent (Viewed Subbed Version). The tones match with the character designs/personalities, and it never feels forced or inadequate while expressing emotion. The entire Sound (Songs, Effects, Voice) is presented spectacularly.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is incredibly detailed and well written. Ranging in all emotion it dose have a more serious tone to it. This is not a show for everyone. However it is incredibly unique, especially well written, and immense with beautiful music. Your able to see children, grow into teenagers, and finally as adults. The emotions of innocence, adolescence, and maturity, mixing together along the journey. Creates characters that are relatable and show believable emotion constantly. The choices made, and how they grew after each trial, made them feel all so real. You watch as life tries to survive, but it\u2019s more then just that. This a true masterpiece to watch. The story will leave you thinking about not simply what you\u2019ve just watched, but about Life and the choices we ourselves make, and the choices of societies past and future. \\n\\n\r\n\"We have to change our way of thinking, If we plan to change the future.\" Watanabe Saki.",

            "content": "Shinsekai Yori or From The New World's most convincing moments occur within the first four episodes. The story, which follows a group of psychokinetic children in the year 3000 in a dystopic yet serene Japanese environment, seamlessly weaves plot device after plot device until the granddaddy of straight-forward storytelling literally walks up to the main cast. A beast is captured by our protagonist, Saki, and explains to them upon request, what has happened to Japan to change it so drastically in the last 1000 years. The world of Shinsekai Yori takes four well-crafted episodes to establish it's universe believably. What follows seems tangentially related tothe original psychological thriller-cum-mystery opening. \\n\\n\r\nA slew of nonsense begins here, where thematically, there was never any room for. A political drama and action anime begins immediately after episode four with a romantic drama unconvincingly inserted in right afterword. This all joined together by a supernatural setting which seems boundless to the viewer leaves for massive plot holes, unnecessary subplots, and outright disregarded information.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of the series are extremely simple. Many characters are written in as attention grabs, who die without doing anything but progressing the story without adding any additional layer of emotion (Inui, Shisei, Squonk,  Rijin). These characters come frequently in Shinsekai Yori and feel cheaply and artificially used. That the story is furthered again and again by use of character introduction and eventual demise at first feels necessary, that the pacing and lack of character focus serve a greater purpose. Yet, by the end of the series we reach a conclusion that nulls most characters entirely from the series, leaving the viewer wondering what the purpose behind many subplots and character scenarios really was. \\n\\n\r\nThe main cast of the series feels particularly unkempt. Between the two time skips, none of the development behind the characters is shown on-screen. For the most part, it felt as if new characters were created and replaced the familiarly named cast. Saki, whose character has unbelievable plot armor, manages to survive every obstacle that she comes to face with despite having average to no ability using her psychokinetic abilities. Opposite her is Satoru. Satoru's character repeatedly changes based on situation, and despite Satoru receiving the most screen time, next to Saki, he never truly interacts with another character. Both he and Saki go on many adventures together, but never do they have any sort of deeper connection other than that they were in the same group of friends together. Satoru's character changes from a one-dimensional precocious to a one-dimensional smarmy without reason, and then from the latter to an one-dimensional hero.\\n\\n\r\nShinsekai Yori attempts at creating a gray morality by only using black and white arguments. Squealer fervently backs up this claim. Introduced in episode five, you can only assume what a character named Squealer can be like. In this leave-it-to-the-name style character design, squealer squeals on the main cast. He betrays them multiple times in three episodes. Then later on when Squealer is reintroduced, he is still literally a backstabbing rodent. The daft main characters seem almost impervious to the obviousness of Squealer, resulting in one of the most painfully direct and drawn out politically based story lines in an anime. The masquerade of moral ambiguity only serves to mock the viewers intelligence, leaving for an extremely expected and dissatisfying ending.\\n\\n\r\nShun is the most interesting character albeit a Gary Stu. Throughout the first nine episodes of the series, he remains mostly static, supplying seemingly otherworldly insight to the other children simultaneously acting humble. He receives a healthy dose of character development during a particularly interesting story line in the series, but is soon forgotten in lieu of continuing the romantic drama aspect of the series. What is worst about this strange intense focus on Shun followed by a dramatic disregard is that he inexplicably  influences events even after he departs from the series. Saki is saved on a handful of occasions through the voice of Shun, which makes it feel once again that the characters only served a greater purpose of linearly reaching a happy ending.\\n\\n\r\nMamoru and Maria are so negligibly involved in the main series events it is laughable, and like their position to the story, their characters suffer immensely. The most thrilling part of their characters is that an uninteresting romance forms between them with no prompt which should be noted is not even really character. This romance of course serves only to produce a plot point later in the series. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound receive solid praise. The series has an excellently used voice cast. The lack of an opening helped the pacing of the anime. The background music, while overused and often misused for a cheap \"spooky\" effect or to create tension in undramatic scenes, for the most part was enjoyably used. Sound effects were decent, but a notable flaw was the clicking of the queerats, which was more annoying than stylistic. The character designs were very bland but served well to create a muted and realistic-looking cast. The animation was regularly on par, but many scenes can be identified as cheaply made by overuse of black backgrounds, extreme close-ups, and static mouths - especially at a distance. Note episode five, without a doubt an atrocity of animation. Beyond that animation was regularly fluid and even exciting. Monster designs stayed fresh throughout the series as well.\\n\\n\r\nWhat started as a fanciful mystery quickly became a predictable drama. As a final opinion, I do not recommend Shinsekai Yori. Many other anime approach it's philosophical topic in superior ways and do so without treating the audience like children. Shiki quickly comes to mind, with Eve no Jikan following on the shortlist. Shinsekai Yori ultimately is crippled by it's many genres and quick, deliberate shifts in tone. The many plot holes and bland characters make for a regrettable and sadly unmemorable watch.",

The first 3 episodes it feels like nothing happened at all and a lot of viewers propably stopped watching this great anime.\r\nBut if you hold out until episode 4 you are awarded with a lot of insight in what is hidden behind this happy-world facade.\r\nStory: 10\r\nShinsekai Yori is really dependent on it's story which slowly builds up and keeps surprising the viewer every 2-3 episodes with some new shocking story details or an unexpected twist.\r\nArt: 8 - Sound: 9\r\nArt and soundare overall very good and match the style of Shinsekai Yori pretty well. Also IMHO the outro song Wareta Ringo by Risa Taneda is the best anime song of the season!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nEach character of the group is really unique and the character development leaves no one behind. Also the focus on Saki as leading character is really good while she tries to figure out the greater image behind the story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nIt would be 10 points for me, if the first episodes could be a bit more interesting, but otherwise this anime keeps me eagerly waiting for every next episode.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10\\n\r\nWhy 10 points you ask?\\n\r\nSimple because Shinsekai Yori has a story which is so unique and thrilling!\\n\r\nIMHO we need more anime like this which make more use of the story instead of simple fights, ecchi etc. etc. etc...\\n\\n\r\nEDIT: After having seen 19 episodes I can confirm, that this is certainly a masterpiece of a story and a really well done adaption as anime!!",

            "content": "Shinsekai Yori, or From The New World, is a teen-oriented piece of dystopic speculative fiction, the latest addition in this new wave of teen fiction to which the success of Hunger Games has opened the doors.\r\nThe series follows the adventures of five kids, from their childhood to their adulthood, in a medieval-ish post apocalyptic setting, where the only human left are the one possessing a special psychic ability called \"Cantus\".\r\nWhile the first episode is quite good, establishing the setting and the mysteries behind it (\"what's the government hiding?\", \"how did the world get like this?\"), the series pretty much falls downwards after that, with episode2 weirdly shifting the tone to high-school hi-jinx (admittedly it is foreshadowing but, as it happens many times in the series, in order to deliver us world details it suddenly changes tone, making for a very disjointed and uninteresting episode) and episode 3 basically killing any mystery with a long exposition sequence.\\n\\n\r\nWith almost everything resolved, the story stumbles aimlessly for ten or so episodes, as... things... start to happen. We get to see lots of short story arcs that, while again foreshadowing small story details, don't really feel connected to each other and don't offer any particularly gripping narrative. The series even pushes the reset button a couple of times, making the character forget, and having to re-learn, story details that we already know... riveting...\\n\\n\r\nThe story does pick up a bit with the last story arc, putting together all the awkward foreshadowing it did until that point and finally having a long story arc that feels significant to the world in which it is set.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I feel that the first batch of episodes was intended to be about establishing and exploring the main characters before letting them loose in the final arc, in the practice it doesn't really work that well. First of all, I'm sorry, but the characters are just not that interesting, as most of them are pretty one note, secondly the main conflict of that part of the series is basically kids vs shady government... which would be fine, except that the government in question is... just not that shady, as again we learn all of their motivations in the third episode... and... they make quite a lot of sense.\\n\\n\r\nAlso this series has a serious problem with beating us over the head with things that have already been explained over and over again.\\n\\n\r\nSo... with an interesting setting that gets squandered, likable but ultimately flat characters, big problems with tone and pacing, and the trivialization of any mystery element the series could have had... is there anything good in Shinsekai Yori?\\n\\n\r\nWell there is that one amazing musical theme we get to listen at the beginning of some episodes, and the series direction is quite good and can set a very eerie mood when it wants to (and when the characters shut up). Most than anything though I like how it engages with sexual themes, working as an interesting allegory for the sexual confusion of puberty and adolescence.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest I quite like how Shinsekai Yori approaches youth and puberty as a whole. and how it manages to translate those themes into a post apocalyptic coming to age story. Sadly though, while the ideas behind it are solid, the execution leaves a lot to be desired. The fact that it is a 25 episode slog doesn't really help, as it does feel that with a few episodes cut down the series would flow a lot better and generally be far more enjoyable.",

            "content": "Shinsekai yori is an adaptation from a novel, with the same name, which has 2 volumes that were released in 2008.\r\n The story of this anime takes place a thousand years from now, many humans have evolved, now they are able to use a psychic power called cantus, but there's no improvement in technology.\r\n In that kind of world , the 5 protagonist, live in a village that's seems normal at first sight, but they start to realize that their town have a lot of forbidden knowledge, to put it simple Shinsekai yori is the tale of a group of friends that start discovering manyconspiracies, and how that affect on their adolescence.\\n\\n\r\n When I watched the series I couldn't help to compare the events, on how the conspiracies affected me, and I didn\u2019t find many differences, because the reactions of the characters are portrayed very well.\\n\\n\r\n The story also has good action phases, fast scenes, warlike times; fantasy besides the humans, the animals have also evolved, now they are able to think, speak as humans, and that makes them more interesting and important in the plot; mystery, the fact that censure/conspiracy is the most recurrent theme in this series makes mystery one of the strong points of this anime, here you are equal with the protagonists discovering the mind blowing secrets of that society. With those aspects and many surprises, the story in synthesis is so dynamic, that makes the necessary suspense to make me wish for more after the end of each episode. (10/10)\\n\\n\r\n Concerning art, with pretty sceneries, animation that is slightly better than the standard in the late 2012, shinsekai yori deserves a \"very good\" and a bit more in art, but how the complex power of cantus and the mystical scenes are well portrayed, for me it deserves the \"great\". (9/10)\\n\\n\r\n Now sound, well in like the 5 episode, i realized \"wait... this anime lacks of OP\", but I don't mind, the ED \"wareta ringo\" it's so good, even the lyrics of the song have the essence of the series, I\u2019m even grateful that the anime doesn't have an OP, because I can see more shinsekai yori, and that the ED didn't change after the episode 13. Concerning the background music, it never disturbs, it has good relaxing songs, and it placed at the exact moment, so it's good. (9/10)\\n\\n\r\n Characters, I think that here is where shinsekai yori shines the most, because the psychological characteristics of the characters is splendid, there's always an explanation to the reactions of the protagonists, and the reactions are never exaggerated. I consider shinsekai yori as a psychological drama, because the psychological factor is fundamental in the series. Also knowing that they are teenagers, their changes are so unpredictable, that helps to the dynamism of the series. (10/10)\\n\\n\r\n Enjoyment, here there's not much left to say, as I said before I can't wait for another episode after seeing one, I really like this series. (10/10)\\n\\n\r\n And finally overall, I haven't seen a well thinked series like this before, where nothing is random, this anime makes you think, and entertain you. It's seems that many people drop the series (and gave it a low score) in the first chapters, because the story is so slow at the beginning of the series, but who prefers a series that starts good, then it begins to get bad and finally it ends horrible; in this anime occurs quite the opposite, it starts slow but then every ep is better. I highly recommend this series. (10/10)",

            "content": "There's often a point in one's life to acknowledge the possibility of another worldly phenomenon that is outside of our collective conscience from where we live in that is in contrast with our own ideals. This has always been a subject of discussion since Plato's \"Allegory of the Cave\" that chronicles how our limited understanding of the reality that we perceive may not be what it seems since we're so entrenched in our own ideological society. Many works of fiction have dabbled this subject matter numerous times with some succeeding and others failing. Unfortunately for Shinsekai Yori, it falls into the latter, but not entirely.\r\nTostart out the basic idea of how the story of Shinsekai Yori pans out is the fact that it's a coming of age story focusing on five different characters and their journey in discovering what the past history of human civilization eventually transpired into pure dystopia. In the beginning it starts off extremely well with building up these characters that are all very unique and distinguishable from each other. There's never a moment where I couldn't remember who a specific person was and it's not just from their appearances but from their well-written personalities and backgrounds. Their childhood arc paces itself nicely in giving an atmosphere for us to take in that's mysterious and puzzling in a very limited understanding of what the world is actually like because that's how the childish mindset would actually be like in this scenario. However, once that arc was finished and we get our first time skip it doesn't get too extraordinary as one would hope.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that makes the time skips really off-putting is how there's hardly any build up on how these characters' personalities matured over time. For instance, one of the most controversial things about the show was the relationship between the characters that were of the same-sex. It's not so much the relationships themselves that I have a problem with, it's how it comes out of nowhere with hardly any development behind it. In this sense it feels as though there was more to their relationships but for the sake of timing constraints they had to rush it so it won't feel dragged out. Because of this one might feel inclined to give it a pass, but for me that cannot be forgiven with the given context this show brings on the table in wanting to be this grand epic that ultimately feels lazy from a writing perspective. In fact, the best romantic development in the entire show was between Saki and Satoru because of how long we've followed these two together and how strong their bond was in helping each other through the hard numerous obstacles. Alas, the rest of the relationships that are thrown out didn't really make a huge impression because how weak and lazy they implemented it into the story; if they actually had anything of value for us to see how they got to that point it would've been for the best.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the story itself isn't something we've seen before, it is still a mysterious and very suspenseful drama that manages to pull off some great twists through the course of the narrative. That is until the realization comes to mind when the pacing of it all fails to make it a masterpiece in the writing department. Like I said before about the time skips, they really dumb down the pacing because of how they rush some of the arcs that felt like they could've been more effective had they have been done with better intentions such as at least showing us a montage of them overtime. That shouldn't mean that time skips are unnecessary in any given situation but it takes a lot of care and precise handling to make them work. Time skips aside, the other pacing issues mostly happen in the middle part of the show where scenes lacks clarity in it's exposition in giving us a clear concise way of what has happened or what will happen to the characters or future events. Too fast to even comprehend the over-arching conflicts that arise from the protagonist feel muddled and disorganized for us to piece together on what will transpire. This could come into play with the fact that the show skips over some of the important details in the novel, but for the sake of reviewing the show itself there's no need to go over that aspect.\\n\\n\r\nHow Shinsekai Yori handles its world-building through expository dialogue receives a mixed response from me. It works like a pattern where one of or all of our heroes are journeying or trying to find answers and eventually they'll talk to someone who will explain everything to them in no more than ten minutes either the dark history of Japan and how it eventually became a grim dystopia or what the ethics counsel is really like underneath. While the history itself is really thought-provoking at times that bring into question human nature and how society structures itself into chaos, I can't help but feel that it could've been done more better with less tedium and not feel like a lazy attempt at being profound.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not just the writing that feels off, but the technical side of the show feels very limited and looks really shoddy in the process. That's not to say all of it looks bad, there are definitely a lot of beautiful set pieces drawn into the backgrounds and the character designs look very unique and fit well to the tone of the show. However, there are a lot of problems with the designs of the monsters that inhabit Shinsekai Yori where they don't look really well-drawn and their animations look like if a low-budget studio was hired to animate them. There's even one episode where the animation took a complete nose-dive where the queen of the queerats looks like a huge blob that wasn't drawn fully of what it was originally supposed to look like. I'm not saying that all shows have to look extremely high-budget or in order to be called good art/animation but it doesn't really strike my fancy when there's nothing significant to gaze at to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nNow with all of the negativity I've had for Shinsekai Yori, there are still a number of things that are really good and even fantastic that are worth watching. It is without question that the amount of suspense and heart-pounding tension that Shinsekai Yori has to offer is astonishing to say the least. The first three minutes of the first episode alone garners some needed praise for it's really well-directed atmosphere, right down to the music and editing of all of the events that happened in present-day Tokyo. It's tone is not pretty and it will nonetheless make a lot of people feel uncomfortable to sit through in some instances, but that should warrant a lot of credit to the show in giving us a very mature tone that comes in full-swing. What makes the suspense amazingly good and imposing is the amount of mystery that we are given through the children's perspective and how we can never see how the adults' see the situation that goes on in the world. Often times you don't see stories handle mystery this way and make for an intense experience to go through. The first person narrative through Saki gives a distinct feel to how we see her grow into this person who is fully aware in later life that feels undeniably human to me.\\n\\n\r\nAs many have told me about the story in all of its faults is that the ending makes up for it, and it definitely does provide to the story a satisfying conclusion. There were definitely no predictable outcomes that were present in the narrative's end and that guarantees Shinsekai Yori some much needed acclaim for at least not giving us a story that isn't inherently generic in a predictable sort of way. There's no Hollywood gimmick that severely tarnishes the gritty tone, it handles itself in a very realistic fashion that feels very satisfying to see first-hand.\\n\\n\r\nMusically, it mostly consists of really bombastic chanting music that is very haunting and intimidating from the style of tone it tries to set. There are very few questionable choices of songs that Shinsekai Yori has that feel out-of-place in any scene. Intense orchestration that also borrows from some minimalist influence in some ambiance tone it gives with light electronically ambient mixes in-between scenes that are inherently quiet and simple in their nature.\\n\\n\r\nAmbitious though it may be, Shinsekai Yori just doesn't cut it fully as a supreme masterpiece that has come out in recent years with the problems it possesses in giving us a badly paced story that can't really give a concise narrative that's hard to get around. Character development feels good in some areas, but due to the poorly put time-skips, their relationships felt contrived with inconsistent expository problems that feel as though they wanted to make the same-sex relationships so that it would seem more progressive when it really comes off as just lazy development. I wouldn't classify this show as completely bad in that the amount of suspenseful tension makes for a really intense experience to behold in showing us the one great development of Saki into a full realized character. After all, a worthwhile experience with many faults in its technical aspects is at least more tolerable than a show with great technical prowess with no added value to the experience whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: B-\\n",

            "content": "Shinsekai yori was something else...\r\nFirst let me say Shinsekai yori was not a light watch at all. This is a thinker's anime. Casual viewers will probably be very turned off by the serious nature of the show. Having said that, for those of you who are looking for an anime that shows the story of a dark, fear ridden society in a brutally honest way keep on reading!\r\nShinsekai yori is unique in which it has no correct set of morals. The line between good vs bad is blurred to the point where the viewer sympathizes with the antagonist.\r\nWhy is this?\r\nIt is because Shinsekai Yori isvery realistic. \\n\r\nLet me give an example to further the meaning of the previous statement: In modern society many consider stealing to be a sin while others justify the act in order to feed their families.\\n\r\nIn other words survival is all that matters and that is what Shinsekai yori is, a situation in which survival is the only thing that justifies an action or not.\\n\r\nNow logic such as this will undoubtedly result in very disturbing outcomes and decisions so viewers should brace themselves for very gruesome events.\\n\\n\r\nIf anyone is expecting to see plenty of action/comedy/happiness I suggest you think twice about trying this anime. Positive moments are stretched out far in between and thus rare throughout while tragedy is almost always present. Also casual watchers should beware that Shinsekai yori requires some degree of analysis for it to be enjoyed to its utmost potential.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are still with me, Great! Here goes the review. Everything is spoiler free!\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9.5\\n\r\nThe setting involves a dystopian society 1000 years into the future that has actually reversed progress regarding industry and technology due to human beings obtaining telekinesis. We observe the society of year 3000 through the eyes of 5 children who are just as clueless as the viewer. The story is narrated by one of the children, Saki, as the anime shows the events of the children's lives and their fates from the ages 12-26. Throughout the anime the group of five learn of the evils and secrets that society has hidden away. Upon learning, life changing events take place throughout their lives, affecting not only their relationships but their sanity as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Shinsekai yori takes the concept of a dystopian future but applies it in its own very original style. It explores various sinister and dark themes of the human mind through solving the thrilling mysteries of the society and its past.\\n\r\nThe story was highly original and refreshing due to its thought provoking and mature layout. Taking a story such as this and adding the amount of realism Shinsekai yori provides results in a story that is close to flawless.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7.5\\n\r\nNow I must admit, the art would amaze me one episode and then would make me cringe the next. For example there were many instances where some of the character's faces and bodies were so warped it shocked me that such mistakes were made in production. Although having said that, there were various instances where the art was absolutely stunning. Gorgeous still shots and surreal dream sequences beautifully portray the gloomy environment. \\n\r\nJust try searching up Shinsekai yori and looking up some HD scene pics.\\n\r\nI give the art a 7.5 because the production team really made some episodes look absolutely horrible while others were done brilliantly.\\n\r\nTo sum it up the art is inconsistent and is a hit or miss depending on the episode.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nShinsekai yori did not have an OP, which may bother some. I skip the OP 95% of the time so the fact that Shinsekai yori had no OP was not a negative factor personally.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was spot on in providing the gloomy dark atmosphere for the anime. It really stood out. Each time a track played it would send shivers down my spine as I watched in awe as to what was happening on screen.\\n\r\nFor the episodes where the art was done well, once the music played, it would produce some of the most chilling scenes of any horror anime I've ever seen. \\n\r\nOne thing that should be noted about the music is that it is very repetitive and is rarely varied. Although in Shinsekai yori's case this isn't necessarily a bad thing.\\n\r\nWhy change something that does its job 110%?\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7.5\\n\r\nNow I have to admit that the characters are decent at best. I doubt that even Shinsekai yori lovers and fan boys would put one of the characters in their favorites. Although they are not very memorable the reason I gave it a 7.5 was because their actions and reactions were very realistic (something the whole anime has going for it). From tough decisions to shocking news, all the characters reacted in ways that the viewer could relate to. \\n\r\nOther than the realism most viewers will likely not be very attached to the characters which will thus reduce the emotion induced upon tragic events.\\n\r\nNonetheless, I still give it a solid 7.5.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\\n\r\nBoasting a plot and environment that could have potentially catapulted it into my group of masterpieces Shinsekai yori falls short due to suffering to a tedious build up with some unmemorable characters and inconsistencies in art.\\n\r\nOverall I highly enjoyed Shinsekai yori and its wonderfully refreshing story and believe that any anime fan that truly loves mystery, horror, and plot twists must give Shinsekai yori a try.\\n\\n",

            "content": "[4.0/10]\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\nWe wage war that tears down walls and buildings brick by brick, as our own inventions create and destroy. We put roofs over our heads only to light them ablaze. We create a hierarchy only to rebel against it. It's an endless coil, a snake eating its tail, feasting on the notion of betterment. If we dismantle our creations enough times and iterate upon them, surely we will reach that stretching plateau of perfection that our own ideology believes in. Yet once the dust and soot settle, we can only regret our impulsivity, our misunderstanding; the ladder of progress we eagerly climb is infinite, andthere is always someone looking down on us. Yet from that rubble, a flower blossoms. \\n\\n\r\nFrom a New World is desperate to tell us what we've been told before in a unique way. Whether it be that despotism is bad or that uncompromising control of sentience is evil, the results are virtually one and the same, and in this case, necessary. Furthermore, much like any tale of dystopia, we are presented with similar character beats, analogous narrative structure, and identical revelations. Yet none of this is a negative to me. See, I like dystopia. In fact, this signature sci-fi concept is one of my favorite tropes in entertainment. I like seeing similar ideas be iterated and expanded upon. I even find joy in witnessing ignorant, blinded characters have that signature horrifying revelation of, \"Oh shit, my entire life is a lie!\" \\n\\n\r\nFrom a New World reinforces that joy, as the narrative itself is, in concept, quite good. An impressive, detailed world that was clearly birthed and seasoned at the hands of a novelist. Their pen bursting with ideas, as they terraform a white mass into something rich and structured. You could make an encyclopedia out of the knowledge given, albeit a short one, and still feel as though the folded over edges that hide that last inkling of wisdom are just out of your grasp. A flurry of creative concepts that give and give until you are figuratively stuffed and questioning what is truly right and wrong in this imagined world. \\n\\n\r\nI don't feel as though I'm discussing the series, though. For all the creative strength that Yusuke Kishi, the novel's writer possesses, little of it is adapted. By that I mean, it feels as though A-1 picture's, in all their incompetence, simply took the words on his page, stripped out the prose and detail, and injected them into their abridged script. I see nothing but the story in From a New World, and for a product that is an audio-visual experience, utilizing both audio and visuals in such heavily flawed ways is beyond inexcusable. \\n\\n\r\nAn infection spreads throughout the presented world. That infection is power, the ability to control and manipulate objects and people. These infected people destroy out of fear, out of want, out of desire, and the world collapses at their whim. Through that collapse, a new society and hierarchy are birthed. New rules are created, new ideologies formed, yet the remains hang just below the shimmering surface, waiting patiently. That permeating mysticism is the backbone of From a New World. Especially once we are introduced to Saki Watanabe and her merry clique of character archetypes; each one varies in hair color, personality, and talent. That talent, of course, is what they are together for. You see, in Kamisu 66, one of the many sleepy towns that dot this new world, children discover their innate powers about when puberty hits. From there they are inducted into an academy and begin learning how to harness their strength.\\n\\n\r\nAs viewers, we are thrust into this setting with enough exposition to clue us in on just about every action taken that isn't purposefully shrouded behind the pervading mystery. This group is sent out exploring, adventuring, getting in trouble, all with the notion that they will come into their own. What becomes clear is that this society is constantly on thin ice. Any unwanted movement risks the collapse into the freezing water. If the allegory behind power isn't clear enough, let me also mention the subservient colonies of \"Monster Rats\" that reside in this world as well. Ugly, mole-like creatures that show intelligence, yet speak with slurred, barely comprehensible speech. They don't have power so they serve the ones who do. Get it? \\n\\n\r\n\"Are we the baddies?\" May as well be the thesis to From a New World, and that is inherently interesting. The notion isn't spelled out immediately but seasoned veterans of dystopian writing can most likely deduce that the progressed, oppressive side is generally the one you should not trust or at least question. Whether their actions are necessary is half the intrigue in From a New World. Once again, all of this is taken from the novel, from the source. These ideas are lifted and splayed out in front of us. Examining the series itself, though? We are left with eerie orchestral vocals and stringing chimes to enrapture moments of total flaccidity. \\n\\n\r\nA-1 Pictures can't seem to get it right. Their feeble attempts with Your Lie in April, smothering every element of music behind manga-esq exposition about how beautiful the music we can literally hear is. Or, in this case, deciding to ignore the fact that anime is an audio-visual medium. The fact of the matter is, From a New World is unbelievably boring. It is, for the first fifteen or so episodes, one of the single most flat and tedious series' I have ever put myself through. Virtually everything about this series is flaccid. The animation, directing, even the musical stings are often used ad nauseam. Nothing is given room to breathe; everything that the adaptors thought needed to be explained was explained. \\n\\n\r\nYou see, a novel has the ability to have large exposition dumps because the reader sets their own pace. A fast reader can shoot through these segments and siphon all the necessary information from them. Especially when large sections of supposedly good, mysterious plot progression is back ending these bursts of exposition. Yet the series doesn't have that quality. It's a twenty-minute anime, and that fact ruins the entire product! The writers need to get this massive amount of information across, so they have to cut out those valuable segments of proper writing because there is no time to have them. They rush from beat to beat and those beats are the least interesting part of a visual medium. That's not to say it is unable to be adapted. It simply requires a talented, unique approach to showcasing information diagetically. \\n\\n\r\nIn episode three our group stumbles upon what I can only call a glowing information hedgehog. While they call it a false minoshiro, all it is is a glorified exposition machine. That entire episode was them sitting in a generic, boring anime forest listening to this man-made device literally tell them everything they want to know except what just so happens to be a crucial piece of information the entire series wants to keep a mystery. It's genuinely unbelievable how weak this presentation is. Now if there were redeeming factors to the shot composition or animation maybe I could remain engaged for what is a glorified reading of a Wikipedia page. However, there is none of that.\\n\\n\r\nFrom a New World is ugly. It has this somewhat unique aesthetic, with flat colors and a gray, dusty palette. Yet the director has seemingly no idea how to direct color, or images, for that matter. You'd think it is easy to create compelling shot composition when you have virtually no animation to worry about, yet this series' unsightly palette is all that is to be seen. From a New World uses something I see in every A-1 show and plenty of other anime; I call it \"texture muddying.\" They are clearly rushing the product and the artists either don't have the time or talent to draw proper backgrounds, so they instead just color a texture onto flat environments using what I imagine is a tool from their digital art software. These environments lack all semblance of depth and quality, resulting in some horrendous design. Decent character-designs stand in fields of muddy greens and shit-stain browns that are drained of all vibrancy for no apparent reason. \\n\\n\r\nSimilar to last season's Violet Evergarden, the director isn't grasping why one should use a certain color palette or filter, instead prompting for a stylistic choice that holds absolutely no reason or merit. Glaring, abrasive CG rocks are hurled through the air in some tensionless action scenes where the characters take a backseat to whirring, synthetic sound design that is constantly repeated for every telekinetic \"move\" these characters employ. \\n\\n\r\nThis aggressively weak presentation is compounded by endless exposition that disregards any potentially interesting writing for blunt explanation. It lasts for minutes on end with minimal flashbacks or any sort of engaging material to consume. The application of these ideas is beyond misguided and feels downright disrespectful to the author who clearly put effort into this world. More so than just that, the series feels as though it is presented through a passive voice. Nothing is imminent. Nothing is about to happen. It already happened. Multiple episodes pass with virtually no tension established. \\n\\n\r\nFor example, a character runs away and hides from their impending doom at the hands of their own people! Yet we don't see this. We see their friend's reacting to their disappearance and then finding them. Seven minutes of exposition as to why they left ensue. A few minor, fuzzy flashbacks reveal what they experienced and then the credits roll. This happens constantly. Everything experienced by our protagonist, Saki, always feels as though it already happened and the viewer is just treading on ground that has been stampeded on. The majority of the actions she takes aren't even out of her own volition, and the small number of actions she decides to take are either frustrating or minor in the context of the entire series. \\n\\n\r\nI can only place this blame on the series' presentation. Virtually every fault is at the hands of the people adapting this novel, as they visibly fumble over themselves and fail to convey any form of intrigue when by all means it should exist in abundance. Once these tedious pieces begin to fall away and we enter the third act of the narrative, we are met with more focused storytelling. It feels as though the earlier segments only existed to convey the few ideas that were carried over into this act. I began feeling somewhat rejuvenated and started to enjoy the kinds of revelations I was expecting from this narrative. None of it was all too surprising, but as I stated earlier, I like dystopian stories and From a New World breathes some interesting ideas into this potentially stale conceit. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, once the final credits roll I couldn't help but ask myself whether the many hours of tedium and despondency was worth the neat conclusion and I can't help but say no. It really wasn't worth it. The presentation is so weak that reading a summary or just the novel itself would've served to be a better way to spend my time. If watching this series was like biting into a sandwich made of mud and feces which housed a delicious piece of chocolate at the center, chewing through all that only for a hint of sweetness would still result in a putrid taste. \\n\\n\r\nThe title of the series breeds mystery, intrigue, a will to go forward and discover what comes from the new world, both literally and figuratively. I'm sure the novel follows through with that mystery at least to a certain extent. I can't judge the novel based on the abridged, mangled body presented by A-1 Pictures, though, and I would never want to. What was initially a holistic work was chopped up to only include the most mandatory elements presented in a lifeless way with sporadic moments of inspired shot composition blended hideously with endless, muddy animation and tensionless scene structure. However, the ethical questions of greater good and excusing horrendous actions to negate even more frightening results is fascinating. A truly unique way to expound upon established dystopian concepts and pulling inspiration exactly where it is iterated upon. \\n\\n\r\nGiving appropriate praise where it's due, From a New World succeeds through its ideas, and fails through its presentation. Sadly, that's hardly a feat in this medium. In film, visuals are the single most important element. The same should be applied to animation. We can have a film without sound, without story, yet it can be something that blooms with quality. A novel is bound by different chains, so an adaptation requires a specific effort to be applied to change a long-form story into a completely different medium that utilizes unique presentational elements. As it stands, the title is what breeds the mystery. The cover art was why I initially picked this series up. Yet From the New World, only disappointment blossoms.",

            "content": "Everyday we wake up, preform our daily ritual, then go to sleep, and all the while the world around us seems so perfectly normal. We, as people, have evolved to accept the normalcy of everyday life. It is seeing how people really act when normalcy is torn away from them that many people find so intriguing. \nThe sad fact of the matter is that mystery thrillers are so rarely done right that people over look them without a second glance. Shinsekai yori is one of those gems that does it right, and should not be looked over so easily. \nThe Story (10):\nShinsekai yori is setone millennium in the future. Yet the the depicted future will remind you more of a feudal japan as there are no fancy gadgets or mecha robots to really say \"Hey, this is the future!\" Instead people in this distant future have created themselves a Utopia, and hold psychokinetic powers know as Cantus. \\n\\n\nIn this \"New Age\", Cantus users are the dominate species on the earth, while humanoid rats known as Queerats also inhabit the planet. They are treated mainly as slaves and do work that Cantus users don't deem worthy to be done by themselves. These Queerats literally refer to Cantus users as God.\\n\\n\nThe events of Shinsekai yori follow a certain group of friends as the try to master their Cantus through schooling. All the while Watanabe Saki and her friends try to unravel the mysteries of their society, and in doing so also unravel the normalcy that we humans hold so dear.  \\n\\n\nThe first three episodes are entirely used for world-building, while nothing special they lay the foundation for a beautifully intricate story to be woven. After finishing episode four, the story of Shinsekai yori becomes a compelling work of art. Any small plot holes this anime may seem to have are hugely overshadowed by the seamless transition from one episode to the next. \\n\\n\nIt becomes almost impossible not to relate the world of Shinsekai yori to the world we live in now. As normality is ripped away from the lives of our protagonists and the darker themes are revealed you will realize how truly mind boggling the writing of this masterpiece is. \\n\\n\nThe ending of Shinsekai yori could not have been better. It leaves no questions to be asked and really ends the story right. It does not leave one wanting more, rather the ending concludes the story in a way that sums up all events and any questions you may still have.\\n\\n\nOne of the biggest complaints about the story of Shinsekai yori is that there are homosexuals scenes, and yes there are. These scenes are in 1-2 episodes tops and the are completely relevant to they story. I assure you that they are not there for no reason, and will, if anything, add to the depth of the presented story. \\n\\n\nArt (9):\\n\nThe character designs of Shinsekai yori may take some getting used to for some, but it very beautifully done and suits the work quite well, the backgrounds are desktop worthy, and the animation effects are quite stunning. \\n\\n\nThe only misleading part about the artwork is that it appears to be very light and happy. Shinsekai yori is not light and happy, Shinsekai yori does have some graphic violence at heaver points in the show and the art style can somewhat take you out of the moment. But it in will no way keep you from being on the edge of your seat as you click on the next episode. \\n\\n\nThe highlight of the art in Shinsekai yori is by far the backgrounds you will see. The artists put a tremendous amount of detail into the work, and it payed off in making some of the best scenery porn in anime.\\n\\n\nSound (10):\\n\nWow. The tracks played with this anime blend so smoothly into the moment that you won't even realize the music is playing. It sets the feeling in a way that enhances the story, never once did I find a kink in the sound that would have lessened my enjoyment. Something that really blew me away was that Shinsekai yori doesn't have a musical opening. Instead, it has one of the best musical endings in all of anime. That is no exaggeration, the EDs for Shinsekai yori are fabulous. \\n\\n\nThe voice actors did an immaculate job. I can't express this enough, the voice actors did so well with this anime. They fit the characters perfectly. \\n\\n\nCharacters (9):\\n\nOften times we see plot driven anime fall short because of the characters in them. It is when we find a set of characters that fit a story perfectly that it really shines. Shinsekai yori has a beautiful cast of characters. You will even find yourself loving to hate the antagonists. As I said earlier, the VAs did so well with the characters that you will never doubt why they are doing what they are doing, or why they feel the way they feel. What actually happens is that you begin to see yourself in them. \\n\\n\nEnjoyment (10): \\n\nI watched all 25 episodes in one go. I believe this anime to be a masterpiece in the best way. The entire show felt tense/dark, and I couldn't help but get sucked in. Yes there are some pacing issues, and there are homosexual themes in 1-2 episodes but that never took away from the enjoyment I experienced watching this anime.",

            "content": "Where is the line drawn between what's morally just and what's misguided conviction? \r\nUnsettling, immersive, mystical and also sadly overlooked. Shinsekai Yori is a gem that has fallen through the cracks of the general populace's graces. Not to say it isn't known but rather it's become degraded and stigmatized by those that resort to petty remarks regarding the infamous episode 8. This in turn impeded many from watching the show and that's a shame. But for those that have given Shinsekai the light of day, it can be said that it's truly an anime worth one's time and its lately garnered praise is proof ofthat. Today I'll try to shed new light on this title, if for no other reason than to encourage a few others to also give it the benefit of the doubt and to see pass the naysayers. For those that do, you'll be gifted with a new anime to remind you why anime as a medium is so remarkable. \\n\\n\r\nBy far the strongest aspect of SY is it's story. Most shows tend to tackle only one aspect and keep that as its focus throughout its duration. It's difficult to tackle several major storylines in a short time period but not only do SY do so, it also manages it with ease. The transition from a show wrapped in mystery to one that deals with human ethics were impeccable and well linked. The first storyline we tackle involves the slow unraveling of the show's lore and the dystopian society our characters are apart of. That alone would be enough to last the shows duration but it took this element and further used it by expanding to the second half of the conflict. Through proper foreshadowing and buildup this was made possible as the mystery, when solved, opened up a new bag of worms that is carried all the way to the show's very last concluding scenes.\\n\r\n  The second part of the show involved the foreshadowed conflict involving the beasts of the land that \"coexist\" with human society by serving them. The beasts of the land known as the Monster Rats can be seen as allegorical representations of forced subservience and mistreatment that plagues mankind. The show leaves their presence unsettling but never resorts to preachy melodrama. With those familiar with Orwell's novel Animal Farm, it becomes easy to draw comparisons in the approach the novel takes with SY in displaying this animosity that humanity is known for. But unlike the novel the conflict is escalated to a grander scale. It isn't the most subtle way to tackle the subject but certainly a one uncommonly used, especially in anime, which further makes the title a rarity. The problem begins with humans and how they mistreat the beast. But it doesn't simply show fear and the inferiority complex brought on by it but also the retaliation caused by being in constant oppression. It's a historical fact the oppression leads to uprising and eventually war, this anime perfectly captures that in its own obscure way. If there was ever an Japanese proverb to sum up what this premise tackled it would be \"a cornered rat will bite the cat\u201d, the \"rat\" further establishing the merits of my aforementioned allegory example. In the end the show forces you to ask the question \"who was right / who was just?\" with its last minute revelation. \\n\\n\r\nIf there was ever an area that needed any improvement it would be here. The animation was very lackluster to say the least and when compared to other shows released around the same time it becomes more apparent BUT where the show lacks in fluid animation it makes up for in highly detailed art and proper color placement. There are many times in the show where contrasting colors, monochromatic scenes and color limitation was used to properly capture and convey the given tone it wanted to represent. May that be with a scene involving only cool darkly tint colors to invoke isolation or that of a sunset that brings on an ominous aura. The people behind these subtle but effective choices show that they're very well versed in their field of work. They worked with their limited budget and through clever lighting and other techniques made most of it's limitations to go unnoticed by the untrained eye. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSimple yet effective. It's amazing what a few soundtracks can do to enhance a show's scenes. The color choice scenes I mentioned above became further heightened when coupled with the music. May that be the beautiful yet bone chilling choir chanting along with booming instruments or the softer long sweeping ones that gives a feeling of dismay and helplessness. Each and every track fell into place with grace and is one that will stick with you long after the credits roll. Also worth noting that the ending is among the best I've had the pleasure of listening to with the intricate guitar composition and well timed vocals. The voice actors were all fine and even tolerable dubbed as well. Standout being John Kaiser's role as Squealer.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the only area of SY that I can find a true qualm with. Despite it's well explored setting and great world building only two characters were given any layered characterization and dimension. The first being our lead Saki as she's the one tossed into the difficult situations and grows as she learns more about the hidden secrets in her society. What makes her great as a lead is that she isn't portrayed as a 1 sided \"fight for what's right\" mouthpiece but rather she understands the need for the  necessary evils. That doesn't mean she doesn't fight against it but she don't act in a way that's pigheaded or irrational. She isn't made out to be someone with stubborn conviction that isn't subjugated to change but is shown as someone who simply wants what's right. She is later developed as the show goes along, making her time on screen one welcomed.\\n\r\nThe other layered character is Satoru as he's a constant companion to her. He doesn't get anything in the way of development as Saki did but he is layered enough that he feels like a person and not a simply a 1 note character. They could of spend more time to flesh him out further but given the show's focus what we got was enough.\\n\r\nThe antagonist for the series isn't layered per say but he becomes the one that forced the viewer to take a second look on the show's overall interpretation. As such his role is fine in the context of the story and adds value to it.\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters don't really have much in terms of layered dimensions as they were never given any prolonged screentime to be flesh out. They were better as a whole than when viewed individually. But what can be noted was how the show handled them. It showed how fragile their mentalities were by the misgivings of their society's social order. The bonds they try to uphold and cling on to can be seen as co-dependence since they can't stand on their own. Something like a mental crutch that adds an interesting dynamic to their relationships. It's handled with a certain nuance which makes up for what they lack as individuals. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nWhen I saw the propaganda surrounding this title floating around the anime community I became one of those people that was hesitant to give the title a try. I had forgotten about it and it wasn't until months later after constant praise that I watched it. If I had any regret it would be not watching it sooner as I hold this title in high regards. I can't recommend it enough. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nShinsekai yori is a title that deserves more acknowledgement, not only is it a tribute to dystopian literature but also one that sets a benchmark for other anime titles to reach for. It is truly a masterfully written tale that is handled with a sense of class and finesse. If given the time of day I'm sure you'll receive something substantial out of it. \\n\\n\r\nFor similar titles I recommend:\\n\\n\r\nShiki: A tale about vampires that follow the same ethical themes brought up in SY. Not as polished in writing but still one worth watching.\\n\\n\r\nSuisei no Gargantia: both contain a plot twist that are identical and answers the same questions regarding perception of morality. Although it isn't handled with the same level care as Shinsekai it's still short enough and easy to watch to recommend giving a try. \\n\\n\r\nWolf's Rain: dystopian-esc setting with discrimination and war, more of a \"road\" anime shrouded in mystery but gives off the familiar aura of the unknown that SY does.",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVEIW**\r\nDuring the Fall season of 2012, animation studio A-1 pictures was airing two anime. One of them was the infamous Sword Art Online; the international sensation that essentially made money faster than it could be printed. It went down in history as one of the most hyperbolized and dramatic popularity explosions of all time. In the wake of the massive tidal wave created by the anti-Christ itself (or the messiah, depending on your perspective), there was another anime; an anime that was swallowed whole by the mainstream hype of the industry. An anime that barely anyone bothered to watch. An anime that nearlyeveryone in its already small audience dropped because of a 10 second yaoi scene in episode 8. An anime that was a complete financial failure. \\n\\n\r\nWhy is this story concerning? I\u2019ll tell you why: because that anime was called \u201cShinsekai Yori\u201d. If the name doesn\u2019t mean anything to you, that\u2019s probably because you haven\u2019t seen it yet. There is little debate that this anime is something special; it has one of the most mature and refined tones in the history of the medium, the music and animation are unbelievably atmospheric, and the world building is absolutely unparalleled. To the anime community, none of that mattered. Shinsekai Yori\u2019s monetary disaster coupled with SAO\u2019s monumental success sent a very clear message to the industry: More SAOs, less Shinsekai Yori\u2019s. *Sigh, this is why I drink. This is also why I write reviews. Ladies and gentlemen: Shinsekai Yori.\\n\\n\r\nSynopsis: One millennium into the future, society exists as a utopia in which every human possesses \u201cthe god\u2019s power\u201d; a form of incredibly powerful psychokinesis. Our protagonist, Saki Watanabe, lives in this utopia that is completely barred from the outside world. However, her and her friends begin to discover some of the dark secrets behind their society as their perfect little reality begins its slow, downward spiral into disaster, as all utopias seem to do.\\n\\n\r\nLet me reiterate something I mentioned earlier; this is a very mature anime. When I say that, I don\u2019t just mean that there\u2019s a lot blood and gore/sexual themes (although those things certainly exist in the show). Rather, I mean to say that you have to be a mature person to enjoy and understand this show. The pacing is very, very slow, there is a LOT of info-dumping, and the show lacks the energy or excitement that you would typically see in a psychological show. Virtually all of Shinsekai Yori\u2019s plot is spent building its vast, unique, fascinating, and disturbing world.  This anime is the absolute pinnacle of world building; arguably the best of all time. The utopia that is the focus of the story can only be described as staggering. The most beautiful thing about the setting isn\u2019t merely its depth, however, but rather the way in which the show\u2019s themes are built so perfectly around it. The implications of the way this society is run and how it began are legitimately shocking, dark and frightening. This anime will almost certainly give you the chills, but it goes beyond just that; it makes you legitimately think. Perhaps the scariest part about the show is that nothing about it is unbelievable. Nothing about it is unreasonable. There are no good guys, there are no bad guys. There is only a group of organisms behaving according to their nature. At the risk of spoiling the plot, I will not go into much depth about the intricacies of this outstanding storyline. Just know that it will leave a serious impact on you; it is easily the highlight of the show.\\n\\n\r\nBecause the main focus of the show is undoubtedly the world building, Shinsekai Yori\u2019s characters don\u2019t receive nearly as much time or attention. However, that certainly doesn\u2019t mean that they aren\u2019t good. Our protagonist, Saki Watanabe, serves as a parallel to the audience\u2019s experience; she learns about the truths of her world at the exact same pace as we do. This makes her extremely relatable and the audience is able to know what she is thinking and what she is feeling at all times. Although some could argue that she (as well as all her friends) merely serves as a medium to explore the setting, the reason I believe that she is a fantastic character is because she is ultimately the one who brings the themes full circle at the end of the anime.  Although she is certainly passive most of the time, it is ultimately her thoughts and actions that hammer in the message of the show. Saki is one of my favorite female characters ever. The supporting cast, however, lacks depth.  While they all have their own basic personalities and motivations, they ultimately just serve as the passive mediums I mentioned earlier, this time without the thematic implications of Saki. They are certainly likeable (I really liked Sataru), but they don\u2019t offer as much as I would have liked them to. Then there are the antagonists (if you can even call them that).  Going into any detail on this matter is a spoiler, but the seemingly evil actions executed throughout the narrative puts the concept of morality itself into question; it makes you legitimately consider what is evil and what is justified. That is the mark of truly fantastic writing.\\n\\n\r\nI also feel the need to mention the superbly surreal presentation of the show. The animation is incredibly crisp and the color pallet is visually appealing, but the artwork stands out in particular for its wide variety of amazing designs.  Every human character has a great design, which is impressive enough, but the show also features a plethora of strange, grotesque, and fascinating creatures. Shinsekai Yori does a fantastic job of coming up with creative appearances for these creatures and making them all memorable. In short, the animation is top notch. The music, on the other hand, really steals the show. This anime has no OP theme, as is tradition, but it instead has one of the greatest ED themes of all time. Some would argue THE best. However, it is the OST that\u2019s the really impressive aspect of the sound; it is absolutely mesmerizing. The potent combination of haunting, spine-tingling pieces and sad, somber pieces combine to form a remarkably large part of the show\u2019s atmospheric and chilling environment.  Also, the voice acting is well above average. Truly a memorable presentation style.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Shinsekai Yori is one of a kind. It chooses to walk the path of a mature, thought provoking, somber tale and never strays from that path. It\u2019s not flashy nor is it particularly exciting, but it certainly is remarkably written. If you ask me, Shinsekai Yori is a masterpiece. You would be hard pressed to find a more fleshed out and imaginative setting in all of fiction; not just in the realm of anime. Needless to say, I highly recommend this show and I\u2019m glad to see that it has gotten the attention is deserves after an initial period of failure.",

            "content": "Shinsekai Yori (From the New World) is something of an eclectic anime series. It's based off a novel, which hands it very different premises compared to anime that are based off manga or games (and for that matter, original anime), which is pretty evident in its characters and story, following few of the bigger anime clich\u00e9s.\r\nMuch can be said about its story and its contents, but at heart it's a big metaphor of growing up, from the utopian-seeming setting in the beginning to the more nuanced view we're treated to later - not as a result of the world changing but as the result ofthe viewer - and the main characters - simply finding out more about the world and how it works, and adapting accordingly. It doesn't just settle with \"children growing up\", however, at every point and turn there's dark revelations and disturbing implications, some of which are never answered but deftly left for the viewer to contemplate, and right up to - and including - the ending, you always feel that something is just... out of place. The setting feels off, but in a good, \"this is disturbingly cool\" kind of way, so while maybe a little uncomfortable, it amplifies the overall mood of the series. Dread is, perhaps, a good word for the sensation.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are treated to a lot of interesting hurdles and obstacles, and it's interesting to see them interact with the world and each other, even if some characters take an unfortunate role as vassals of the story or infodumpers. Even so, the series' focus on karmic elements, the evil of the subconscious and the gnawing effects on those humans left isolated from their peers all serve to further define and contribute to the character dynamic. The latter half, where the pace really picks up, also brings about themes of oppression and supremacy and skillfully manages to instill a sensation of moral gray rather than good and evil. Conflicts are abound, simply put, and challenges the characters in intriguing and often unexpected ways.\\n\\n\r\nAesthetically there is little to hold against the series. The colour palette is lush and the animation fluid. It rarely fails to deliver excellent character designs and animations, and likewise its special effects are lovely indeed. On the auditory side, it delivers a soundtrack that contributes strongly to the perturbing mood of the series. The opening theme is as harrowing as it is good, and the ending theme wrote itself swiftly into my favorite list. The voice acting is overall good, I am especially impressed with newcomers  \\n\\n\r\nTo sum up Shinsekai Yori is hard, but its essence is a dark story about a world where few things are as they seem, that deals with a large host of themes - many more (and no less important) than the ones already mentioned -, set in an aesthetically wonderful world. It adheres to few of the clich\u00e9s and stereotypes of the day, and is that anime that comes along once in a while with a really refreshing concept and story and executes it well. Characterization could have been done a little better, initial pacing maybe too, and some story elements were a little hard to accept, and so on and so forth. Regardless, I can only finish with this: Give Shinsekai a try!",

            "content": "\"What a journey.\" \r\nThese are the words I said to myself when I had the pleasure of completing Shinsekai yori (From the new world). A-1 Pictures, while known from some of it's notoriously bad series, has really left in me shock on just how they could produce a compelling, unique, and deep story. Along with it's fantastic characters and their development throughout the series, to the sensational and masterpiece soundtracks used, Shinsekai yori manages to do almost every aspect flawlessly. It's an anime that manages to leave viewers reflecting on real world issues with Shinsekai yori's universe and how everything is not all that seems.It tackles on the issues of lust for power, rising against tyrannical governments, morals, beliefs, and psychology of not just humanity itself, but from the other intelligent species living on Earth, and never once did it leave me in boredom throughout the short length of it's 25 episodes run. With all it's praise it supposedly delivered, is Shinsekai yori truly a masterpiece that I would recommend anyone to watch? Is there any aspects about the show that I felt was weak, or tried to execute but not properly?  Like majority of my reviews, I'll be going over the the 6 main points: story, artwork, sound, characters, overall enjoyment, and my summary thoughts with the final verdict. I'll try my best to keep this review completely spoiler free as possible as well, while only covering plot points and scenes from the first episode.\\n\\n\r\n\"We have to change our way of thinking if we really want to change the future.\" - Saki Watanabe\\n\\n\r\nThe most notable and praised element you'll find if someone were to recommend Shinsekai yori is how it handles the story throughout the series. The rich lore and captivating story line will get viewers invested quickly in the show. This could even be done in the very first episode, like it was for me. The idea of an outbreak of Psychokinesis, the ability to manipulate and change matter; whether it's making yourself or objects fly, setting something on fire just by looking at it, killing someone by just staring, is executed very well in the opening scene. We get to know right away what's happening to our present, the fall and destruction of the old world, and the rise of the new world 1000 years later into the future world of Shinsekai yori. From there on, the story follows the perspective and narration of Saki Watanabe, a 12 year old girl who obtains the powers of Psychokinesis, or what they call it now: Cantus. We also get to see how the world 1000 years later is. To our surprise, there's no technological advancements or flying cars to be found, and it looks like society has taken a step backwards by isolating their scarce and fragile communities from one another. This is all due to humans becoming the dominate force of the world, where Cantus is the building foundation of how their society functions. There are also many other species roaming around the planet. The most notable and intelligent ones, the Queerats, are predecessors of the naked mole-rat. They're bipedal, can understand human language, and worship humans as \"gods\" from their Cantus. They have many colonies each ruled by a queen, and some work as slaves for the humans, swearing complete and absolute loyalty. Along with Copy-Cats, supposed cat-like creatures that are rumored to come after human children, and Fiends, humanoid creatures that the elders teach the children about to prevent one from ever coming to the village, are all mentioned briefly in the first episode, but later on explored further into the story, and become very significant plot points.\\n\\n\r\nThe psychological, science-fiction, and supernatural elements all come together to produce a gripping and epic storyline, leaving almost no details or plot-holes behind. The audience at first may not fully grasp the big picture the story is trying to tell you at first, but later on, specifically in episode 4, we get to see how this supposed Utopian society the humans live in is not all it seems. With a very good beginning, an even better middle, and fantastic conclusion to the story (quite possibly the best I've ever seen), it's no surprise to say that the story of Shinsekai yori is nothing more close to a masterpiece that you'll ever find in an anime, and rightfully deserves that title. The art of Shinsekai yori can best be described as being very diverse and unique when it comes to it's artwork. It makes the setting for a world that's taken a step back of any kind of futuristic technology shine brightly. Visuals, the environment, and character models are all breathtaking to look at. There was not one time that I noticed any horrible animation or questionable choice of visuals/colors for a scene. Blending and shading of scenes are also done very well, weak at times, but executed properly. Whether it be the night sky, mountain ranges, forests, buildings, Shinsekai yori delivers quality artwork, a factor not heavily discussed when describing your favorite anime, into a dynamic and awestruck world.\\n\\n\r\nOnly second to the story, the sounds and music that Shinsekai yori produces incorporates the strengths of compelling human emotions with realistic sound design and high class soundtracks to bring life to an engaging story. Every sound; whether it was simply as turning the page of a book, the listening of footsteps through the school, the background noise of wildlife, and the echoing of voices, Shinsekai yori always used sounds appropriately and in a meaningful way to describe what's happening right now. This was the first anime ever that I actually appreciated the different sounds used and how it set up the mood. Simply amazing. The OST tracks were all very unique and memorable to listen to. 'Traditional Song of Shadows', a very commonly used soundtrack in the anime, always gave the feeling of suspense, anxiety, and hype whenever it came on, and was always used in the right situations where the audience was left to feel emotional with the situation at hand. 'History Of Despair, used for compelling and especially suspenseful moments, filled me with emotion while listening, I could actually feel the tension and suspense inside of me. My personal favorite and arguably best soundtrack: 'Wareta Ringo', the ending theme for episodes 1-16, is a masterpiece, and I never once skipped the ending just because of this fantastic song - And I always skip the endings. With greatly used sounds, very well composed soundtracks that'll get you tapping your foot everytime they come on, the sounds for Shinsekai yori is one of the best soundtrack I've ever witnessed in anime, right next to Clannad and Clannad: After Story's soundtrack. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Shinsekai yori, like the rest of the anime, were crafted and thought out beautifully. Character development, dynamic and complex personalities, interesting backstories, and realistic values were presented in the majority of the cast. At the top of my head, I could only think of 2 or 3 characters that may have had wasted potential, but not too many fell under that category. The main characters in Shinsekai yori are all children, so you get to experience they're perspectives in their dystopian society. Saki Watanabe is the main protagonist and narrator of the story. A very outgoing, yet sensitive girl who values her friends, family, and town very dear to herself. She argues a lot with her friend Satoru, and is very close with her two childhood friends Maria and Shun. She has trouble at first with her Cantus, but gradually overcomes it. She is my favorite character, as we get to see her fantastic character development the most. Satoru Asahina is a very observant and intelligent, yet energetic boy who likes to pull pranks and tease Saki a lot. He's a very likable character that at first I did't think much of, but later becomes very significant and important, especially near the middle and ending. Like Satoru, Shun Aonuma is very clever, and the most mature one out of the group. He's the brains at the sage academy with near perfect scores every time. The elders expect great things of him when he reaches adulthood. A pretty complex character, but not nearly as great as Saki and Satoru. Maria Akizuki is Saki's best friend who's the most feminine of the group. She's shown to be protecting and commanding Mamoru, the groups other member a lot. She's remains a pretty static character throughout the length of the series. Mamoru Itou's a very shy, timid boy who rarely expresses his concerns or opinions in the group. He's my least favorite of the main characters, but by no means a bad character. Like Maria, he's also a static character. Squealer is a queerat with very high intelligence, sly, and astute. He is the representative of the Robber Fly colony of queerats. He's my second favorite character, and possibly the most complex and dynamic character of the storyline, with fantastic character development near the ending.\\n\\n\r\nMy experience and enjoyment with Shinsekai yori was nothing like I've ever witnessed before. I've heard praise, mixed opinions, and spite from this anime, so I was going into it without the intent of thinking highly of it at first. But boy, was I completely blown away over how good this anime actually is. Like mentioned above, it just does almost every aspect right. It gets the plot moving smoothly, with making sure the audience knows what's going on through the narration, delivering a fantastic story. It has fantastic artwork and scenery, masterpiece soundtracks and different sounds used to fit the mood and premise of the scene, very well crafted characters who have great character development and important roles, rarely being wasted. This anime will make you think, it'll make you feel sad, happy, emotional, and an array of different feelings while you experience Saki Watanabe's life with her friends in the new world ruled by the super-human ability of Cantus, and how it affects everything around the world, the different species and how they interact with humans, and the government of a supposed utopian society not being all that meets the eye. You will want more after reaching the fantastic conclusion, like I did. \\n\\n\r\nA recommendation to anyone who wants a compelling, dark, psychological story, with all other aspects of characters, sound, artwork, and enjoyment being near perfect in every sense. Shinsekai yori is an anime I'll never forget, and will remain in my top favorites for years to come.",

            "content": "Upon revisiting this anime exactly two months from when I last finished it, (03/31/13) I am reminded of things that I have missed and that is this.\r\nIf there is anything to be said about this anime, it's that it is extremely emotionally draining. With the trivialities of art and aesthetic pleasure aside, this anime is incredibly real with its plot twists and deep themes. With enough analysis, one could make an extremely satisfying paper on the choices of the characters and the moral injustices that may or may not have been present during the series.\r\nSTORY 10/10\r\nStarting off with my initial impression of this anime, Iwould like to say that I knew what was coming (having finished it) but admit that I had no idea what the hell I was in store for when I watched that first episode. Did I expect this to be a happy-go-lucky anime? No. Did I expect this anime to be abundant with extremely dark materials? No. Did I expect a lot of the things that happened? No.\\n\\n\r\nThe truth is, all of the events that transpired made sense in the end, and that many of what seem to have been irrational decisions were not without reasoning behind them. The story is so complex and ripe with plot layers that it's hard to comprehend many of the actions that the characters devoted themselves to.\\n\\n\r\nWhich is why I would give the story a rating of 10. It was incredibly well done and, though it may seem naive to rate it such high a score, I believe that it deserves the effort that was placed into it in order to lead us into a state of enlightenment at the end.\\n\\n\r\nART 9/10\\n\r\nAs touched upon very briefly during the intro paragraph, I mentioned that the aesthetic appeal was none too great in this series. And although many viewers would be put off by this \"more realistic approach\" to an anime that is quite newly finished, I would like to state that it was self-evident that the art helped itself rather well. With a more human approach to anime, Shinsekai Yori did a fantastic job portraying humans in their own habitat. \\n\\n\r\nWhich is why I gave it a 9. Not incredibly pleasing in an aesthetic manner, but did work quite well in order to provide a more realistic approach to modern day anime.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND 9/10\\n\r\nDvorak, need I say more? Being an avid follower of classical music, \"Largo\" (aka, Going Home) from \"From the New World\" by Antonin Dvorak is a beautiful piece that is visited in much of its glory. Playing the part of one of the main themes of Shinsekai Yori, I was quite disappointed to see that not much of the rest of the movements of this said piece was shown. Otherwise, the sound was superbly done, with amazing ending songs and a dramatic opening tune that always nicely introduced the episode.\\n\\n\r\nSo, well, 9. There could have been much more variation of songs, but otherwise the sound aspect of this anime wasn't very crucial in understanding the major themes and plot. Well done, and an extra point for Dvorak.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER 10/10\\n\r\nI could write an entire essay on the analysis of these characters. With that being said, I leave much of the judgement up to you, as the main individuals of this anime were incredibly well-written and developed. Though antagonists or protagonists weren't very clear, I would have to say that this aspect made many of the characters more believable, as no individual can always be extremely good or extremely evil.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in the story made extremely practical decisions based on their situations and acted very maturely in certain predicaments despite their age. \\n\\n\r\nBravo, indeed, for the characters. Bravo. 11 if I could, but I can't.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT 8/10\\n\r\nThis was obviously an extreme displeasure to finish. As explained prior, this was an extremely draining anime that I took much time and deliberation to finish. Breaking down before the half-way point of the story, I could not find myself enjoying this anime but continued for all the other rewarding aspects. I think that I enjoyed it, but am unsure due to my feelings for the overall perspective on this anime. It was wonderfully done and I enjoyed it.\\n\\n\r\nI simply wish I could have enjoyed it more. Sorry, 8.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL 10/10\\n\r\nThis is the TL;DR part. Damn it, if there's going to be something you're going to not regret watching this entire freaking year, it's got to be this anime. Rich with make-believe history and moral lessons (as well as absolutely satisfying characters), this anime has made it to the top of my list of favorite anime. Just watch at your own caution and know what you're getting into. Much content in this anime is suggestive but all leads to an established point. Watch it, and you'll be smarter having finished it. Cheers, and enjoy.",

            "content": "When I first heard about Shinsekai Yori, I was only slightly interested due to the somewhat lack-luster description of the series that was on the chart I viewed before the series aired. However, as I began to watch it, Shinsekai Yori quickly drew me into its universe, immersed me in the art and the lore, and become one of my favorite anime of all time.\r\nThe story of Shinsekai Yori is experienced through the eyes of the main protagonist, Watanabe Saki, as she grows from childhood to adulthood, making it a partially autobiographical experience as an older version of Saki voices parts with narrative. Set onethousand years in the future where almost every human has developed psychic powers called Cantus, the world of Shinsekai Yori is full of both the familiar and unfamiliar. While the humans all look relatively the same as what you could find today in areas, the other denizens of the world are much different from what you would see now. The first episode immediately establishes who should be watching the anime as people get instantaneously squished and torn to shreds in flashes of blood in what would seem to be present-day Japan however, it then quickly shifts to where and when the main story actually takes place. From the first episode alone, it is immediately apparent that something is clearly amiss in the quiet life of Saki's village and the story plays off this sense of mystery. While watching, I never felt that I was left out of the loop on the lore or what was currently happening; the story is paced well so that you basically know everything that Saki knows, and, at times, it isn't really all that much. I felt some sort of connection to the protagonist, Saki, as she journeyed and strove to know the truth in the world she lives in. Much like her, with the passing of daily life and with only one episode airing per week, I gradually began to forget some of the same things that Saki did, almost like the creators actually desired this effect. In short, this show will test your memory. While you don't have to remember absolutely everything to enjoy the story as there are plenty of twists and turns, you will probably miss out on some subtle hints that are dropped by the characters as they talk. Shinsekai Yori is definitely worth rewatching purely to see how all the pieces fit together after you've experienced it once already. Another thing that is worth mentioning is that the next-episode previews of Shinsekai Yori are probably the best I have ever seen, revealing just enough to make me make me wish the for the next episode to come faster, yet not spoiling too much in the process. However, though I always ached for the next episode to come faster, there was a certain \u201chump\u201d in the story in the first few episodes that was particularly dull but, after you got over said \u201chump\u201d, it was smooth sailing from then out and I felt the ending was particularly satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nIf the art of Shinsekai Yori were to be summed up in one word, \u201camazing\u201d. I found that the art style itself is unique and very polarizing. The humans have a somewhat \u201cbland\u201d look to them in comparison to everything else in the anime, mostly because they look \u201cnormal\u201d. The background art can be absolutely stunning at times and the creatures often look grotesque and revolting, which is why I say the humans look \u201cnormal\u201d or \u201cbland\u201d in comparison. The creatures are supposed to look that way and, in all seriousness, the fictional depiction of a \u201cFiend\u201d gives me the chills every time I see it. The animation isn't necessarily the best and while there were parts that could have been better, those are minor and somewhat rare. Although there aren't too many major scenes with crazy animations, there are often small and subtle animations that play a part in the overall story or character interactions, and small stuff like that tends to go a long way in my eyes. All in all, despite the animation not being the greatest, the art in Shinsekai Yori is definitely worthy of an experience that only blu-rays could offer.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound design in Shinsekai Yori isn't so much to create an epic soundtrack as it is to create music that fits the mood, and it does so perfectly. The background music is generally dark, mysterious, mellow, or any combination of the three and while there are certain tracks that stray far from this trend, never once did I feel that the music was intrusive. As I am a proponent of a proper use of silence, or a \u201clack of music\u201d, I must say that Shinsekai Yori pulls off those moments well. In fact, it was due to those moments that Shinsekai Yori became the first anime I have watched where I legitimately felt scared during an episode; there are definitely parts in the series that are meant to instill fear. Mood-setting and silence aside, it is notable to mention that Shinsekai Yori does not have an opening theme at all but rather only has two ending themes. The first ending theme, \u201cWareta Ringo\u201d by Taneda Risa, is possibly my favorite ending theme song from the Fall 2012 and Winter 2013 seasons (the time span which Shinsekai Yori aired) and the second ending theme, \u201cYuki no Saku Hana\u201d by Hanazawa Kana, is good as well, though it definitely gives off a more melancholic feel than the first ending theme.\\n\\n\r\nSo, just to get this out of the way, yes there is homosexuality (both male and female) in this anime, however, it is not prevalent throughout the series and I thought it was taken in a mature and logical way, reflecting the ideals and culture of the anime's society. Homosexuality in Shinsekai Yori can be surmised as such: homosexuality is accepted and it is perfectly okay to love whoever you love but, at the end of the day, homosexual couples often split up to pair with partners of opposite gender because they cannot reproduce otherwise and therefore cannot further the human race but, their love for one another often stays. Although the characters are all psychics, most with the power to wipe out entire armies if they wished, none of the characters ever seemed inhuman- with some exceptions. They laugh, cry, discuss societal issues, and develop strategies, some of which are fairly brilliant. I love how human everyone in the series is but, the ironic thing is that my favorite character isn't even human. While I won't go too much into detail as it is somewhat of a spoiler, he is the ideal warrior in every way, shape, and form and, in my opinion, is a character who demands respect. As far as character development goes, the most major developments happen on-screen while other minor developments happen off-screen. This is mostly due to the nature of the series; Shinsekai Yori tends not to waste your time on the worthless everyday activities that the characters do (except in the beginning), instead using time-skips to get to the parts that are actually important. These time-skips are done in a way such that it doesn't seem like anything major changes about the characters other than appearance, and even then, the characters are all easily recognizable. There are only two personal gripes I had with the characters. The first how Saki acts near the end of the anime- though, in all honesty, it's completely understandable given what she goes through over the course of the series. The second is what truly happens to certain characters, specifically to the ones whose ultimate fates are implied throughout the latter parts of the story but you never actually know for sure (some of you who have already watched the series will probably know who I'm taking about).\\n\\n\r\nDespite the \u201chump\u201d in the story-telling in the beginning and minor, personal gripes near the end, I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of Shinsekai Yori. Every new moment provided either new insight into the universe, characters, or story and there were plenty of twists and tense moments to keep your eyes glued to the screen and keep you on the edge of your seat. The art provides some absolutely gorgeous visuals at times and the soundtrack will provide the correct atmosphere for each scene without taking away from it. I felt connected to the characters, shared both their happiness and pain, and never felt alienated from them. In short, I absolutely loved Shinsekai Yori. After each episode I groaned \u201cMan, why can't the next episode be out already?\u201d Shinsekai Yori is a masterpiece of story-telling and definitely worth recommending to anybody as long as they can appreciate the mature themes the anime tackles.\\n\\n\r\n10 out 10",

            "content": "I don't know how I overlooked this series while it was airing, but I'm very glad I found it. Shinsekai Yori takes place 1000 years in the future in a world populated by psychics possessing the godlike Cantus ability, which manifests as various psychokinetic abilities. Along with the psychic imbued humans, humanoid mole rats called 'Queerats' make up the bulk of the Utopian society in which this story takes place. \r\nThe story follows a girl named Saki and the rest of her school group, Group One. They uncover that something is definitely rotten in the new world. Viewers beware, this series is not the lightheartedromp that the description and series image portray it to be. It is a post-apocalyptic dystopia with recurring themes of memory, ethics, and morality. Violence, gore, and sexuality populate the series at every turn as the mystery of the Utopia is uncovered. Shinsekai Yori doesn't shy away from depictions of free sexuality, often depicted as 'forced drama' in other series but is merely part of the setting. Unfortunately, the focus on that aspect of society wanes as series goes on, providing one of my few gripes about the plot. Interpersonal relationships make up much of the plot during the first two time arcs but takes a major backseat in the final arc. \\n\\n\r\nThe core of the series is a mystery, and it does it spectacularly. The viewer has a distinct advantage over the characters due to plot devices involving memory and occasional voice-overs by an older Saki. This break allows the viewer to attempt to solve the many mysteries of society. While the major twists will come as no surprise to veterans of the dystopia genre, that by no means diminishes the enjoyment. The first four episodes provide the bulk of the knowledge base for both the viewers and the main characters, which is why those episodes are sometimes criticized for being tedious. It's likely a necessary evil, and is fortunately not provided by a one-and-done plot device. \\n\\n\r\nOne of my favorite things about this series is that there are two antagonists. The first are the Queerats who act as both allies and enemies. The second, more interesting foe is the internal one. The inner conflicts of the characters drive the themes of memory, ethics, and morality in a way that a physical antagonist cannot. The final conflict in the series is very well done, but the quest for victory felt underwhelming and insufficiently explained to me. \\n\\n\r\nThe musical score deserves a special note. Excellent variety of music that added perfectly to the overall tone of the series. Whoever was in charge of that deserves a raise, and then some. Worth listening to just for the music, it is rare to have visual and sound mesh so well. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter development is great, but not perfect. The characters don't change that greatly, even though the series undergoes two time skips with years in between. That said, it was refreshing to have no character fall on a strictly good or evil characterization. Each character has their own viewpoint and moral compass by which they abide. \\n\\n\r\nThe art style takes some getting used to, and while I was tempted to give it a slighter lower score it was consistent, leading me to believe that the art style chosen was intentional and I refuse to fault them for that. The Queerats in particular are well crafted, and the action sequences are well done. The scenery often overshadows the characters themselves in terms of detail. I believe this was intentional, and is due to one of the recurring plot points which I will not spoil here. \\n\\n\r\nSummation: This series is excellent and well crafted by any metric. I'd highly recommend it to more mature viewers, but I question how much a younger viewer might get out of it. It would come as no surprise to me if Shinsekai Yori were to eventually end up on 'Must Watch' lists.",

            "content": "What started off as an interesting piece on a dystopian style future fantasy world quickly squandered all the good sense it had at the outset and devolved into a moral confused and seemingly pointless story line. \r\nMy main problem with this series is that it began with some top-notch world building mixed with an air of mystery that should have been the main focus of the show, but it seemed to just forget all of this and move forward in a completely unrelated direction. In this world, every child has the potential to essentially destroy the society and everyone in it, and the people findthat the only way to preserve their own way of life is to kill any child who seems to be straying and to employ the widespread use of memory alteration and hypnosis. To me, this seemed to be setting up a very thought-provoking question: should this society exist, or would it actually be better off destroyed? \\n\\n\r\nInstead of engaging this morally interesting and consequential question, the story runs through a veritable roller-coaster of plot contrivances to set up a completely asinine and borderline offensive question: is it okay to commit genocide on intelligent, seemingly conscious creatures if you have magical powers and they don't? Then the show has the gall to act as if the big reveal at the end somehow changes things and tries to present that question as morally gray while a character who could reasonably be called a civil rights activist is portrayed as the ultimate villain. \\n\\n\r\nThe main characters in this show are incredibly boring and most of them seem to exist only as plot conveniences. Characters are introduced, given the most cursory amount of development possible, then discarded once they have served their apparent purpose. Meanwhile, we are simply told to believe that the protagonist is a strong and interesting character, but she never really lives up to it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall solid artwork, animation, and sound can't save what is, at its core, a fundamentally broken story.",

            "content": "Shinsekai Yori: From The New World of Great Anime\r\nI have no qualms in coming out and saying Shinsekai Yori (From the New World) was not only one of the best anime of 2012, but it was one of the best anime I have ever seen. Very rarely does a series come along and floor me with its overall quality. The story, art, music, voice actors and characters were all downright fantastic. I still can't get over much this anime consumed my attention, so much so that I finished all 25 episodes in less than 12 hours. I can honestly say that this series was anemotional roller coaster that left me depressed and moved at the same time. It takes a powerful writer and a great production staff to pull that off.\\n\\n\r\nFor those of you unfamiliar with Shinsekai Yori, it is a story about a group of 5 children with psychic powers growing up in a Utopian society in the far future. In this society, only people with psychic powers exist and strict laws govern what the children can and can't do. While out on a school excursion, these children come across a strange creature that is actually a robotic device considered to be a \"library\" that provides them information and insight on the past and what had happened to humanity over the past several hundred years. After learning this information that had been kept secret, their world is turned upside down and their lives will be at stake as they have to learn to live in a world that is not as it seems. I'm aware that's a very vague description, but it's difficult to explain this anime's plot without going into heavy spoilers. This series is extremely dialogue heavy and takes several twists and turns, with each line providing a crucial piece of information toward the story.\\n\\n\r\nI could go on-and-on about the strengths of this series because it does everything right. I loved it's cast of characters with a lead character that is a bit out of the ordinary from your typical series. Saki Watanabe is a girl with not a great intellect and she's not a powerful psychic user, but her pursuit for the truth and her emotional resolve make her an interesting character to follow. The rest of the group is made up of Satoru Asahina, a fiery boy that likes to pick on Saki, Shun Aonuma, a cheerful boy that is talented with psychic powers, Maria Akizuki, Saki's closest childhood friend, and Mamoru Itou, a quiet, cowardly boy that keeps to himself but has a deep affection for Maria. I really loved how this series explored each character's personalities and feelings, also going into the realm of how their feelings change for each other as the series progresses. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot and story is one of the best I've ever seen in a series. The way everything played out, the way it was able to tell such an immense story in just a 25 episode series was amazing. It took many twists and turns along the way and really played at your emotions with the way it unfolded. One thing I have to come out and say about this series' storytelling is that I was amazed at how brilliant the foreshadowing was. I am not a big fan of foreshadowing in anime but this series did such a brilliant job of implementing it without completely giving away what was going to happen in future episodes. On top of the foreshadowing, I was also quite impressed with the subliminal messages and social commentary that was portrayed in this series. There are several different messages I felt could've been taken out of the series. The securities of mankind, blocking education, inhumane treatment, racism/biggotry, and manipulation are just a few of the subjects this series delves into, with the main topic being basic human principles and society. I found the messages that this series portrayed were wonderful lessons for people in general to learn and understand how a society should work (P.S. that's not a statement supporting the society from this series).\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork was downright gorgeous. While I wouldn't say the character designs were great, I absolutely loved the shading, the artistic expressions, as well as the human emotions and facial expressions, especially eye contact. I was especially a fan of how well eyes were drawn in this for particular situations when you could feel the characters were in a dramatically tense situation. I will admit though, this is perhaps the first full length anime series I've ever watched that actually doesn't have an OP...but man, oh man, the EDs sure make up for it. The first ED was so beautiful and breathtaking that I'm almost speechless from it. I could watch it a million times and still appreciate something from its artistic splendor.\\n\\n\r\nThe music was downright gorgeous and fit the tone of the series extremely well. While I will admit that it doesn't have an overwhelming variety with its soundtrack (be prepared to hear repetition with the BGM), the way it sets the mood makes it incredible. Going back to the ED, I found the song Wareta Ringo by Risa Taneda to be a remarkably captivating song. How it went with the visuals made for a pleasant viewing experience. While I didn't quite like the 2nd ED, Yuki ni Saku Hana by Kana Hanazawa to be quite as good, it was still a gorgeous ED regardless with a pretty good song to boot. I'll give Kana some props for being the lead seiyuu and singing a series ED as well. Speaking of the seiyuu, what remarkable work. This series had a top notch cast that sold me with each and every one of their performances.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I can't say there are many negatives I can take away from this series, I will note a few minor complaints. The first actually isn't so much a complaint, but rather a warning. If you're watching this series, pay attention to EVERY piece of dialogue, no matter how mundane it seems. It's amazing at how much every detail plays an important role and sometimes ends up being a major plot point. I will note that the time jumps were pretty alarming and abrupt at times. There are two major time jumps in this series and how things \"change\" right off the bat might catch you off-guard. I know it did for me, but at least it was easy to adjust to the time jumps. I will also say the \"sexuality\" that is explored in this series can be a bit off-putting for a few, but I will implore you to stick with it because there are reasons for it and it doesn't last particularly long throughout the series. However, I will warn that it does sort of jump out at you out of nowhere.\\n\\n\r\nAll-in-all, Shinsekai Yori is one of A-1's best. While I am not the biggest fan of A-1, they somehow manage to produce exquisite gems for anime series from time-to-time and Shinsekai Yori was definitely one of them. If you're a fan of futuristic Utopian type anime or stories, I would give this a strong recommendation. Hell, I would recommend this series to anyone that's looking for an excellent story with great characters. I will warn that the mood for this series is extremely heavy and if you get easily depressed, be weary of this series because it gets quite depressing at times. However, despite that, it's still a very emotional series that is quite moving with its messages. Again, I have to say, in my opinion, Shinsekai Yori was the best anime from 2012.",

            "content": "Stop reading reviews. Don't add this to your Plan To Watch. Open a new tab and go watch this show right now.\r\nUsually when I see someone write a review where every aspect of the show receives a perfect score, I disregard their opinion, but in the case of Shinsekai Yori, there is not a single aspect of the show that could be done better. Shinsekai Yori is one of the few anime I have watched that I would dare label as FLAWLESS. There are some anime that you can say are perfect for their time, or perfect for their genre, or at least achieve theirgoals. Shinsekai Yori is not one of them--it is simply perfect.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is more beautiful than any anime I have ever watched up until now. It is not a similar style to Miyazaki/Ghibli films, but it is of equivalent quality. The attention to detail is unparalleled. Characters have unique eye colors, eye shapes, face structures. There are few plain landscape shots, but the setting is an edenic place, and you will not forget that for a moment.\\n\\n\r\nThe music and the sounds are both great. Not overdone, but simply true to life. At times, I forgot that I was watching animation. The characters' emotions felt real and raw. I am not a crier, and this show did not make me one... But even though I do not speak Japanese, I could hear the emotion from the voice actors. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are again, realistic. They have flaws, they have doubts, and sometimes you want to claw at the screen so you can tell them what to do, but they inspire a sympathy in me that I think will stay with me for a long time. \\n\\n\r\nAnother note, this series plays like a movie. I watched it in a few days, and I think that is the way that it is meant to be watched. If you are going to take a break between episodes, I would recommend that you stop after episode seven and then after sixteen. There are no annoying recaps between episodes, there is only one OP/EP (per episode, only one song plays, to be completely clear), so the episodes easily flow together. Of course, you are free to watch it as you wish, but it really FEELS like a movie, and I don't think waiting a long time between episodes will add to the experience. Note that this show is based off of a novel, not a series, but a singular novel. \\n\\n\r\nThis is not a feel-good show. You will feel good at parts, you will feel good at the end... But like a movie, there are extremely high points and extremely low points. That is another reason to watch it in a short period of time. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, as I said, this series is perfect. I would not recommend it to someone who has just begun watching anime, or has not seen any other non-mainstream anime (Paranoia Agent, School Days, and Higurashi no Naku Koro ni would be good preparation). In order to appreciate this anime, you have to see what has come before it and every small imperfection those other shows contain. If you think your palette is broad enough, if you think that there is no anime left to surprise you, if you feel like you can predict what will happen, then watch this show, and be prepared to be proven wrong. \\n\r\nIf I watch something better, I will edit this review to reflect my change of opinion. As of now, there is nothing better than this. It deserves to be #1 on MAL. I would willingly pay to own this show on DVD because I want to support the creator/producer that much. Stop reading reviews. Don't add this to your Plan To Watch. Open a new tab and go watch this show right now.",

My mind cannot comprehend why there's people who thought this was a good show, so out of curiosity i decided to pick it up again. I'm really glad i did that.\\n\\n\r\nShinsekai yori has this concept where in their world, their natural enemy is a being that is impeccable , flawless , cruel and unbeatable  as their histories says that only extraordinary amount of luck can help them survive. This resulting in a battle of wits, which party can outwit others, and they deliver it perfectly. It constantly makes me sit on the edge of my chair, waiting what the outcome of their decision making.\\n\r\nAnd for me, this is the epitome of storytelling. It takes you to their world, put you on their shoes, and empathize with their situation.  \\n\\n\r\nSo pick up this show if you haven't, the only minus thing with this show is you'll become more intolerance to mediocre shows as your brains crave for more and more creative resolution and amusing outcomes.\\n\\n\r\nthanks for reading <3",

            "content": "Story: My god, the writers know how to thrill you. Sociopolitical themes, human weakness and strength, incredibly deep and tragic love, fickleness of memory, communism, post-Apocalypse, and telekinetic abilities! Every development has its importance, and even the initially homosexual scenes have a great, looming weight behind them - history and zoology - yes, zoology. Watch it for your own curiosity. All plot developments has been beautifully placed together one after another, and every twist is a wonderfully orchestrated dance with the viewer's fragile emotions.\r\nArt: I love the soft lines, the gentle colors, and the animation for this anime. I think a very important decision thatI fully support was to include the animation director of Casshern Sins into one of the most important, beautiful episodes in the entire series so far, and it blew me away. The soft colors give a very squeamish aura, which fits perfectly into its intended delivery, and the result is exactly what it is: art, and good art.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I am not an expert on sound, but I thought that the music was enchanting, always matching the scene perfectly. The chorus of children singing provides gloom beyond gloom, as things start dropping heavily near the later parts of the series. The sounds of all the inanimate objects, voices, and the different creatures, all sound perfect to me, so I have no real complaints or opinions to offer.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: This is where the story pulls curtains one after another on you, through the characters. Each character has a distinct personality, one developed through the time you spend watching them move, behave, talk, and think. I loved every single one of them, especially Yakomaru, whose intelligence and aura are outstanding. The main character is not particularly interesting, nor is she intelligent or observant, but she does know how to narrate, and she does that well enough. Her thoughts and reactions are completely normal and expected, and I think she is the reason the viewer is struck in shock at every moment, because she is completely, absolutely, just like you.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I wouldn't miss this for the world. I watched the first 5 thinking, bah whatever, it's a little boring, but the plot picked up faster than NASCAR, and I'm still sputtering from an episode I watched 4 weeks ago. My jaw still hasn't recovered from some of the drops made in that week, and by God, I will buy this in Blu-Ray if it means the end of civilization (pun intended). I enjoyed every bit of it, and I have to say its tour-de-force is in the final 10 episodes. No anime I have seen henceforth has had such tremendous impact on me, and including Clannad, that means something.\\n\\n\r\nIf my raving so far has not been enough, I will say again that I love it. You owe it to yourself to try this anime, at all costs, lest you miss out on something extraordinary.",

            "content": "Five episodes in, I\u2019ll have to say that the experience Shinsekai Yori offers is very varied. At times, I am greatly enthralled by the intense and well executed scenes. Other times, the series leaves me wondering why I\u2019m not doing something better with my time. The story takes place in a future post-war Japan. Rather than being futuristic, the setting leans more towards the feudal side featuring few advanced technology and more magical powers known as the \u201cforce\u201d. Five children stumbled upon a discovery and come to understand the history and true nature of the world they live in. They are thrown into an intenselife-threatening adventure, as much psychological as it is physical. However, as interesting as the settings may seem, which it is, a range of factors deters the enjoyment that it could otherwise have brought.\\n\\n\r\nThe perhaps greatest problem with this show is the detachment of the main characters from the story. For a good half of the first five episodes, almost all of the plot and background is brought to the viewers solely through flashbacks and narration. The main characters themselves do not actually take place in any plot-driving events in the early episodes. This is not a flaw per se as the interesting element of the series is not the actual story, but the intricate settings and the gloomy mood. However, after the story picks up its pace and the characters get thrown into danger, the show turns into more of a horror/thriller than the mysterious and psychological experience that it has previously established itself as. This is very much uncalled for, as the thriller part feels forced and is put there only to push the story along. The things that are actually interesting in the show, that is to say its mysteries and the characters\u2019 minds, are left unaddressed.\\n\\n\r\nIf it did not seem obvious from the previous paragraph, Shinsekai Yori suffers from a terrible pacing. The episodes are frequently inconsistent; some moments have so much stuffed into them that the viewer is not able to reflect over what is happening, while other entire episodes can be about almost nothing. A lot of time is spent in unnecessary interactions between characters. On the one hand this can aid the viewers\u2019 attachments to and understanding of the characters, but on the other hand these are often pointless and serve no apparent purpose except to occasionally brighten up the dark mood. \\n\\n\r\nApart from the pacing problems and the detachment of characters from the story, this series is also plagued by some minor flaws here and there. The characters, while not horribly done, are somewhat clich\u00e9d. Sometimes the behaviours of the characters are also not all that believable for their age, such as displaying great calm and maturity in grave and life threatening matters. Some situations are over-dramatized through exaggerating the characters emotions. Even seemingly unimportant and trivial scenes would see characters scared and crying with the sole purpose of reinforcing the \u201cseriousness\u201d of the show. However, this is somewhat forgivable as they are kids. Many measures are taken in order to simplify the advancement of the plot or to make the settings of the show more believable, and unfortunately some of these are irrational or do not make sense. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the flaws mentioned above can make this series sound like a poorly made show, this is not actually the case as most other things are done fairly well. The mood that this show manages to bring out, alas not consistently, is quite intriguing and deserves recognition. This effect is achieved in part through the dark and frightening settings, but mostly through the art and sound which is definitely a redemption point of this show. A very diverse collection of background music is used, ranging from classical instruments to modern music, as well as a mix between these. The music pieces are almost always used in the right occasions and do a great job in reinforcing the mood or certain emotions. Some of the sound effects, especially during horror scenes, are so brilliantly made that they manage to turn what\u2019s otherwise trivial into something terrifying. The voice acting on the other hand, while mostly well performed, would occasionally give way to very poor and dry voices. However, this is not common and is a minor issue. Another thing in this show that deserves praise is its art. Almost everything, with the exception to some monsters, is illustrated beautifully. In some situations the pictures are distorted or the colour tone and hue would be completely changed in order to reflect the mentality and emotions of the characters. The exceptional art and sound greatly enhances the mood of the show and is a saving grace which really adds to the enjoyment of the series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, while Shinsekai Yori contains a wide array of flaws, it is not actually a bad series. It does suffer from problems such as inconsistent pacing and detachment of characters and story, but there are many good sides to it. The settings of the story is very interesting and the mood of the show, through the use of great art and music, is very enthralling and offers great immersion. This review is only based on the first five episodes of a total of 25 episodes, so all that has been reviewed is preliminary. 20 more episodes, given the innovative and compelling story, leaves great room and potential for something great. Right now the show needs to move away from the pointless thriller to elaborate on the mysteries of the world as well as explore the mentalities of the characters. \\n\\n\r\n*PS: To my great dismay, I discovered that after five episodes, I did not manage to remember a single character name in the entire show. This is not necessarily a bad thing though.",

            "content": "~ENGLISH & SPANISH REVIEW~\r\nI suppose that many of us have once felt in our comfortable immaturity that the world is perfect or almost perfect, that problems do not affect us or we do not notice them because perhaps at our sight they did not exist. But part of growing up is realizing how bad we were and that our sometimes comfortable reality can easily be refuted by the cruel discomfort of others. Also, once in a safe life, we have asked ourselves what is the relevance and importance of morals and ethics, and where it really covers without having to create an ethical discussion aboutsomething that does not merit it. All this is Shinsekai Yori, a simile of our society, a world that in the near from immaturity or ignorance may seem perfect, but inquiring can cost dearly, not only in consequences, but also emotionally.\\n\\n\r\nShinsekai Yori takes us to a story in Japan, but 1000 years in the future, in which after political problems that led to the emergence of telekinetic powers in people led the world to ruin and the difficult restoration of this, however, In that moment, the world seems perfect. There is no discrimination in any sense, love and values \u200b\u200bare valued in almost every sense to maintain a peaceful society. Within this narrates the story and experiences of 5 children along 3 story arcs with temporary jumps between them, which focuses mainly on Saki, a young woman who awakens her kinesic powers in her pre-adolescence and goes to the school with your friends to learn how to manage them.\\n\\n\r\nAs the series progresses a series of events or turns of nuts in the plot will cause the characters to develop and draw conclusions through their first impression, their perfect and utopian world that is slowly becoming sad, raw and dystopian. All this happens under a construction of fantasy world, extremely mysterious and that loves to use as a resource the suspense but not in a deceptive way to maintain the tension in an honest and constant way.\\n\\n\r\nSaid the most central points, I want to focus on the reason why I have given such a high note to this series, and it is precisely the script, its narrative, or plot, is similar to what happens with Legend Of The Galactic Heroes (Saving the proportions) or Welcome to the NHK! in the fact that the animation may look average or good, but the script is so ridiculously well written within the context and message that the series wants to give you that deserves it.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all we have that the series is a fantasy, something fundamental for the fantasy to work correctly is the world-building, and this in SSY is perfect precisely because it takes the time to explain everything that happens, how it works. Cantus and its origin, the relationship it has with the past and its implication, the problems that lead to its lack of control among others, we also have the functioning of society explained at a very deep level, how it is organized, what it uses and structure to carry that coveted peace and that was used or needed to carry this process.\\n\\n\r\nThe drama is perfect, develops the relationship of characters during each episode without overexposing it, characterizes its characters, and shows affection, that is to say, there is homosexuality in SSY but far from being something clich\u00e9, badly argued or average, that even could fall into a badly written romance, turned out to be the opposite, a well-written romance, an affection that feels tangible among the characters, completely justifiable reasons that are complemented by the utopian vision of its construction of the world and without doubt, conclusions of romance which are narratively heartbreaking, the series at no time needs to give you a dose of sadness an overexposure of sadness, it does through its narrative after taking the time to develop relationships.\\n\\n\r\nThe mystery and suspense, here is where the Shinsekai Yori generates the tension of argument, which also in my opinion is perfect, Shinsekai Yori in his section of mystery does not make common mistakes like deceiving the viewer and giving deceptive cliff-hangers. It will always be revealing something in a somewhat difficult way that the protagonists and our main protagonist Saki must resolve, said same, there are things that at first glance will be inconclusive when in fact they are not, there are small clues that tie threads and do not leave any holes in which you must use your head to arm and understand. The suspense is directly complemented with this and far from reaching horror uses it to generate tension constantly, as when the characters try to escape something, find something, or hide from something within the arc argument that is developing.\\n\\n\r\nNow the most important thing, the message. Shinsekai Yori has a lot of messages and I have already left a lot of clear message things, but reiterating them is not bad. It shows us that ignorance can often make you happy, that hard times create strong men who can sacrifice everything and have nerves of steel when making a determined action. That a world in your comfortable ignorance may seem perfect or that its good that it can be but in expanding it you see that it is not true. You see political issues in which they do not agree with anyone and they all argue their points of view so that you can empathize with the ethical, political and moral conflict constantly and without doubt also something that is important is the importance of emotions, a debate The world has always seen that it is the feelings against logic, but here logic needs feelings and that makes it feel so real. And love is an important part of it, that far from being corny, or even dare to engage in homosexual, bisexual or heterosexual relationships, it does so correctly to complement the message. That is why the story or plot of Shinsekai Yori in my opinion is perfect, all his characters learn from this although they must go through extremely hard and painful, but shows how they face all these difficulties.\\n\\n\r\nThe art I like a lot, the color palette or surreal passages or the use of raccontos (past-long flash-backs) are very good, I only criticize something animation that sometimes the CGI looks bad and is completely other, but it appears rather little and there is not much problem, outside of that the animation is improving, sometimes it can seem average for it knows how to correct itself or distribute well when using more or less resources to try to develop the story well. Within this same sound and soundtrack has precious and memorable moments, now I will complement this of art and sound to the script and there are moments that become memorable and the direction knows how to do them well, as certain moments of episodes 10, 16 and 25 .\\n\\n\r\nShinsekai Yori is undervalued in everything for various reasons, perhaps because it is modern, perhaps because it is very confusing, or maybe because the fact that his animation is not bombastic and prefers to use colors to complement what I think is an extraordinary script make all this happen.\\n\\n\r\nThis is why I think Shinsekai Yori is a masterpiece that despite its sometimes limited resources gives a good aesthetic that compensates for its excellent script, for all these things and its message and relationships of such powerful characters I give a 9.6/10 = 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nStory / Plot = 10/10\\n\r\nArt = 8/10\\n\r\nAnimation = 7/10\\n\r\nSound = 8/10\\n\r\nCharacters = 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading.\\n\\n\r\n________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nSupongo que muchos de nosotros hemos sentido alguna vez en nuestra confortable inmadurez que el mundo es perfecto o casi perfecto, que los problemas no nos afectan o no los notamos porque quiz\u00e1s a nuestra simple vista no exist\u00edan. Pero parte de crecer es darse cuenta de lo mal que est\u00e1bamos y que nuestra a veces c\u00f3moda realidad puede ser f\u00e1cilmente refutada por la cruel incomodidad de otros. Tambi\u00e9n alguna vez en la vida seguro nos hemos preguntado cual es la relevancia e importancia de la moral y la \u00e9tica, y donde realmente abarca sin necesidad de crear una discusi\u00f3n de \u00e9tica de algo que no lo amerita. Todo esto es Shinsekai Yori, un s\u00edmil de nuestra sociedad, un mundo que en lo cercano desde la inmadurez o la ignorancia puede parecer perfecto, pero indagar puede costar caro, no solo en consecuencias, si no que tambi\u00e9n emocionalmente.\\n\\n\r\nShinsekai Yori nos lleva a una historia en Jap\u00f3n, pero 1000 a\u00f1os en el futuro, en el cual luego de problemas pol\u00edticos que llev\u00f3 la aparici\u00f3n de poderes telekin\u00e9sicos en las personas llev\u00f3 al mundo a la ruina y a la dif\u00edcil restauraci\u00f3n de este, sin embargo, en esa actualidad el mundo parece perfecto. No hay discriminaci\u00f3n en ning\u00fan sentido, se valora al amor y a los valores en casi todo sentido para mantener una sociedad pac\u00edfica. Dentro de esto nos narra la historia y vivencias de 5 ni\u00f1os a lo largo de 3 arcos argumentales con saltos temporales entre s\u00ed, en la cual se centra principalmente en Saki, una joven que despierta sus poderes kin\u00e9sicos en su pre-adolescencia y va a la escuela con sus amigos para aprender a manejarlos.\\n\\n\r\nA medida que la serie avanza una serie de sucesos o giros de tuercas en la trama har\u00e1 que los personajes se vayan desarrollando y elaborando conclusiones a trav\u00e9s de su a primera impresi\u00f3n, su mundo perfecto y ut\u00f3pico que lentamente se va a haciendo triste, crudo y dist\u00f3pico. Todo esto sucede bajo una construcci\u00f3n de mundo fantasiosa, sumamente misteriosa y que ama usar como recurso al suspenso pero no de forma enga\u00f1osa para mantener la tensi\u00f3n de una forma honesta y constante.\\n\\n\r\nDicho los puntos mas centrales, quiero centrarme en la raz\u00f3n de porqu\u00e9 le he dado una nota tan alta a esta serie, y es precisamente el gui\u00f3n, su narrativa, o trama, es parecido a lo que sucede con Legend Of The Galactic Heroes (Guardando la proporciones) o Welcome to the NHK! en el hecho de que la animaci\u00f3n puede lucir promedio o buena, pero el gui\u00f3n es tan rid\u00edculamente bien escrito dentro del contexto y mensaje que la serie quiere darte que lo amerita. \\n\\n\r\nEn primer lugar tenemos que la serie es una fantas\u00eda, algo fundamental para que la fantas\u00eda funcione de una forma correcta es el world-building, y esto en SSY es perfecto precisamente porque se toma el tiempo de explicarte cada cosa que sucede, como funciona el Cantus y su origen, la relaci\u00f3n que tiene con el pasado y su implicancia, los problema que conlleva su descontrol entre otros, tambi\u00e9n tenemos el funcionamiento de la sociedad explicado a bastante profundidad, como se organiza, que usa y estructura para llevar esa tan codiciada paz y que se us\u00f3 o se necesit\u00f3 para llevar dicho proceso.\\n\\n\r\nEl drama es perfecto, desarrolla la relaci\u00f3n de personajes durante cada episodio sin sobreexponerlo, se caracteriza a sus personajes, y se muestra el afecto, dicho a esto, hay homosexualidad en SSY pero lejos de ser algo clich\u00e9, mal argumentado o promedio, que incluso podr\u00eda caer en un romance mal escrito, result\u00f3 ser lo contrario, un romance bien escrito, un afecto que se siente tangible entre los personajes, motivos completamente justificables que se complementan con la visi\u00f3n ut\u00f3pica de su construcci\u00f3n de mundo y sin dudas, conclusiones de romance que son desgarradoras narrativamente, la serie en ning\u00fan momento necesita para poder darte una d\u00f3sis de tristeza una sobreexposici\u00f3n de tristeza, lo hace a trav\u00e9s de su narrativa luego de darse el tiempo de elaborar relaciones.\\n\\n\r\nEl misterio y suspenso, ac\u00e1 es donde la Shinsekai Yori genera la tensi\u00f3n argumental, que tambi\u00e9n a mi parecer es perfecto, Shinsekai Yori en su apartado de misterio no comete errores comunes como enga\u00f1ar al expectador y dar cliff-hangers enga\u00f1osos. Siempre estar\u00e1 revelando algo de forma algo dif\u00edcil que los protagonistas y nuestra protagonista principal Saki deber\u00e1 resolver, dicho mismo, hay cosas que a primera vista quedar\u00e1n inconclusas cuando en realidad no lo est\u00e1n, se dan peque\u00f1as pistas que atan hilos y no dejan ning\u00fan agujero en la cual debes usar tu cabeza para armar y entender. El suspenso se complementa directamente con esto y lejos de llegar al horror lo usa para generar tensi\u00f3n constantemente, como cuando los personajes intentan escapar de algo, encontrar algo, o esconderse de algo dentro del argumento del arco que se va desarrollando.\\n\\n\r\nAhora lo mas importante, el mensaje. Shinsekai Yori tiene un mont\u00f3n de mensajes y realmente ya dej\u00e9 un mont\u00f3n de cosas del mensaje claras, pero reiterarlas no es malo. Nos muestra que la ignorancia muchas veces te puede hacer feliz, que los tiempos duros crean hombres fuertes que pueden llegar a sacrificar todo y tener nervios de acero a la hora de hacer una acci\u00f3n determinada. Que un mundo en tu confortable ignorancia puede parecer perfecto o que bien su que puede serlo pero al expandirlo ves que no es cierto. Ves temas pol\u00edticos en los cuales no le dan la raz\u00f3n a nadie y todos argumentan sus puntos de vista para que puedas empatizar con el conflicto \u00e9tico, pol\u00edtico y moral constantemente y sin dudas tambi\u00e9n algo que es importante es la importancia de las emociones, un debate mundial siempre se ha visto que es los sentimientos contra al l\u00f3gica, pero ac\u00e1 la l\u00f3gica necesita de sentimientos y eso lo hace sentir tan real. Y el amor es una parte importante de ello, que lejos de ser cursi, o incluso atreverse a realizar relaciones homosexuales, bisexuales o heterosexuales lo hace de una forma tan correcta para complementar el mensaje. Es por eso que la historia o trama de Shinsekai Yori a mi parecer es perfecta, todos sus personajes aprenden de esto aunque deban pasar por cosas sumamente duras y dolorosas, pero muestra como afrontan todas estas dificultades.\\n\\n\r\nEl arte me gusta bastante, la paleta de colores o pasajes surrealistas o el uso de raccontos est\u00e1n muy bien, solo critico algo la animaci\u00f3n que a veces el CGI se ve mal y est\u00e1 completamente dem\u00e1s, pero aparece bastante poco y no hay mucho problema, afuera de eso la animaci\u00f3n va mejorando, a veces puede parecer promedio para sabe como corregirse o distribuir bien cuando usar mas o menos recursos para tratar desarrollar bien la historia. Dentro de esto mismo el sonido y el soundtrack tiene momentos preciosos y memorables, ahora complementar\u00e9 esto del arte y el sonido al gui\u00f3n y hay momentos que se hacen memorables y la direcci\u00f3n sabe como hacerlos bien, como ciertos momentos del episodio 10, 16 y 25.\\n\\n\r\nShinsekai Yori est\u00e1 infravalorado dentro de todo por varias razones, quiz\u00e1s por ser moderno, quiz\u00e1s por ser muy confuso, o quiz\u00e1s porque el hecho de que su animaci\u00f3n no sea bomb\u00e1stica y prefiera usar colores para complementar a lo que a mi parecer es un extraordinario gui\u00f3n haga que todo esto suceda.\\n\\n\r\nPor esto creo que narrativamente Shinsekai Yori es una obra maestra que a pesar de sus a veces limitados recursos da una buena est\u00e9tica que compensa a su excelente gui\u00f3n, por todas estas cosas y su mensaje y relaciones de personajes tan potentes le doy un 9,6/10 = 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nHistoria/Trama = 10/10\\n\r\nArte = 8/10\\n\r\nAnimaci\u00f3n = 7/10\\n\r\nSonido = 8/10\\n\r\nPersonajes = 10/10\\n\\n\r\nGracias por leer.",

            "content": "Please, please, please, check this show out when you have the opportunity. Whether you are old or new to the world of Fantasy adventure anime you are sure to love Shinsekai Yori!! There are so many good things I can say about this show however due to time I'm going to keep it short and sweet. Of the many things I loved about this show the things that stood out the  most were the story, character relationships, (which I must also add, that the show is really emotionally powerful so get ready to feel some while watching.) art, and soundtrack. While there are noticeablescenes and uses of CGI used during of a few of the scenes in the show it doesn't take away the beauty and appeal of the artwork, mostly the scenic settings for example fields, skies, deserts etc. Battle scenes and competitive events were also parts of the artwork that I loved too.\\n\r\nBack to the story though the most important thing about the show, the story is something very powerful. It's like a \"learn your lesson\" no a \"learning experience\" type show. Meaning, when you watch it, most if not all of the events going on in the show have some sort of lesson/advice behind it. It's very psychological, it really gets you thinking about things such as \"the future\" and \"life ahead.\" What made things even better about the show was the relationship between the characters, a bit of a spoiler here, but I must give you a bit of advice and tell you, the reader, try not to get too attached to the characters, this is a horror so expect some things to happens. That aside, the friendship and mostly the interactions between our characters is so powerful, that it really made me feel like I one of their friends so when some \"things\" happened during the show I \"felt\" pretty damn hard.  Now with the music, I cannot remember who the artist and composer was,that aside he or she did a really great job making the events that happened during the show more intense and engaging with the music. So expect to hear some really great emotionally powerful and very intense music to look forward to during the show. Lastly, and overall I must again, highly recommend this title to anyone who is into fantasy and adventure because this show in my best opinion met the proper, and ideal criteria of what an \"outstanding\" or \"masterpiece\" of work should be about! 10/10",

            "content": "I watched Shinsekai Yori based on an MAL recommendation. I went in with an open mind, not entirely sure what to expect. Any descriptions of the series that I read were highly ambiguous and revealed little about the series' content.\r\nBoy, did I get more than I bargained for.\r\nStory: 10 - Shinsekai Yori utilizes gradual pacing and multiple time skips to tell one of the most thought-provoking stories I've ever encountered. I'm going to refrain from mentioning any specific plot details because the less you know going into this series, the better it is. The series is split into three distinct acts: childhood, teenage years, andadulthood. The first two acts are paced rather slowly and often I found myself questioning whether or not the plot would ever actually go anywhere. However, in reality these first two acts are incredibly important and serve as buildup, as it is in these episodes that we slowly realize that something is very wrong in this world. Everything that happens in the first two acts comes to a head in a brilliant final act that doesn't hold back. The genius of this series is that there is never an objectively good or bad side; all sides remain ambiguous. Thus, the story is not presented as a clash between good and evil; rather, it is more like watching events unfold with the ultimate outcome left to chance. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9 - Shinsekai Yori is a visual masterpiece. The villages emanate a quaint and peaceful feel while the landscapes are both beautiful yet unsettling. There are numerous psychedelic-like sequences that not only unsettle the viewer, but also evoke a sense of curiosity about the inner workings of the world and the people who inhabit it. The only reason I didn't give a 10 is because the CG sequences look rather off most of the time, but in the grand scheme of things this is a minor detail.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8 - The soundtrack serves its purpose well. The music complements the current scenario and the show's main theme is grand and ethereal. In a way, the music is almost as unsettling as the plot. The music can stand on its own; however, the series could not sustain itself without the music.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9 - At the show's start we are introduced to the main cast of characters while they are still children. As the show progresses through multiple time skips we see them grow up and change to try to adapt to a world that is not what it seems. The growth that each of the children undergo and the conflicts that they must face as a result ultimately lead to each of their respective fates. The final destinations of every character couldn't be more appropriate--for better or worse.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9 - At first I was expecting a sudden, Madoka Magica-style plot twist early on that would dramatically change the atmosphere of the show for the rest of its duration. Instead I got a gradual plot development that raised numerous questions in my head, and the answers to them were violently thrown at me at breakneck speed over the course of the final act. Although I certainly loved almost every aspect of this series (as I've showered it in praise since the beginning of this review) the slow pacing of the first two acts was at times too much for me. I can only take so much ambiguous buildup. For that reason I gave this category a 9 instead of a 10. If you don't mind slow pacing, then there is nothing not to love here.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10 - Shinsekai Yori raises profound moral and philosophical questions that you won't even realize you were asking until the end of the finale. And believe me, it is a brilliant finale, perfect for a brilliant series. The ambiguity of the plot makes the viewing experience that much more enjoyable, as the viewer is left to come up with their own conclusion about the events of the series. If you liked Death Note or Psycho-Pass, trust me: you haven't seen anything yet.",

            "content": "The way I write a review is different. Rather than starting out which pros and cons of the anime I write out what I understood from the anime and the messages of the author first.\r\nThis anime, is the most interesting out of all I've ever watched. The author takes a really idealistic environment trying to show a realistic meaning. It made me think a lot about it. Basically this anime indirectly focus on philosophy and values of our existence.\r\nCharacter development was done very well but most end up dying right as it is fully developed which isn't negative but the characters that die do havean important role later especially Shun. I'll end it short since if I continue 90% of this review will be of each individual character lol.\\n\\n\r\nThe first 3/4 story reminds me of a book called \"The Giver\" where the MC thinks she's living in a Utopia but many things she encounters will make her doubt the society she lives in. The last quarter of the story involves how 2 intellectual societies clashes and who has the right to remain dominant. This made me thought if we ever met an alien or if one species somehow mutated to an intellectual one, who would have the right to be dominant. The obvious (cliche) answer would be, we would negotiate and eventually live together, but this answer is also the most idealistic one that probably might not happen for a very long time.\\n\\n\r\nI felt sorry for the Queerats, not because they were once human but because the things they did were not wrong, it was a simple revolution that humans done before as well (especially French and American revolution) to throw out the monarchy for democracy. Yakomura did deserve to die but 90% of his purpose was correct just the 10% he wanted to become the superior of the Queerats. It was a good thing the anime ended with giving justice to the Queerats but most of the colonies are dead anyways.\\n\\n\r\nNow how the anime was paced was interesting too. I felt that it went very slow but the speed makes sense for a 24 episode anime. Even with so many stuff happening, way more than Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood, it felt like it was a 64 episode anime. Basically it is weird that I thought it went slow when it makes more sense that I would say it went fast because too much things happen at the same time. I think this is what perfect pacing feels like. It's been a really long time since I 've watched an anime with good pacing.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the message of the author to modern time. The suspicion of the Cantus' society would be similar to our suspicion of our government and that we are way too skeptic. Cantus' society was actually doing the right thing to keep a Utopia even though they had to control everyone's memories. The lost of freedom for perfect protection hmm seems like it is definately a real world modern problem. The second message is in Humans & Queerats. I believe the author is trying to say something about our racism. I find racism fights way too cliche so I don't want to talk about it here since I bet there is absolutely nothing new about racism right now. But another message might also be \"who has the right to be dominant in the ecosystem\". That question is interesting but it doesn't matter until we find some alien or a species  having something close to human intelligence. In the end, that means the author has his/her own theories and questions but don't dare to give an answers.\\n\\n\r\nThe flaws in this anime was how it confuses the audience by skipping some important parts and using those parts as flashbacks. It would also be a lot better if they show how did Saki led the village. The tainted cats are still alive and still being used. But did Saki stopped the program to control the village's  mind and memories? The thing I was looking the most foward how that society can be changed to become a more of a true Utopia rather than the current. But that was never shown sadly. Once again that means the author does not know how an Utopia would work, but it's natural not to know lol.",

            "content": "I recently re-watched Shinsekai Yori, and let me say, I gave it a 10/10 the first time I watched it. I could summarize the plot like many others have done, but honestly, it really doesn't do the show justice until you watch it. \r\nIt begins extremely slowly, and everything seems like filler, which makes it very easy to pass over. Around the middle of the show, a series of events happen that make you reconsider everything that happened thus far, and you realize all the seemingly random events are connected. From this point on, it gets darker and more and more mysterious. \r\nArguably the bestselling point is the fact that the ending is just so clean.  Most animes nowadays leave gaping holes in the plot that require obsessive fans to explain, or they just don't ever really end, or feel like they did (Shounen shit is the epitome of this). Shinsekai Yori answers every question you dared to ask, and then blows your mind with things you hadn't even considered, like basic human constructs such as morality and humanity. The ending alone makes it worth watching.\\n\\n\r\nHaving re-watched it, I can honestly say it actually gets better, some how. You notice things you didn't the first time you watched it, and the detail to which they go to add these things is absolutely amazing, even small things like their classes just have so much symbolism, foreshadowing and detail. \\n\\n\r\nIn an era, of increasingly shitty anime, like SAO, Naruto, and the various harems and moe-blobs, Shinsekai Yori defies everything you expect out of an anime, and leaves you desperately wanting more like it.",

            "content": "My goal in writing this review is convincing you to watch this anime, I believe it is something everyone should see. I do not however want you to know anything about it beforehand.\r\nThis is unfortunately an unsolvable problem since you are reading this in order to find out what sort of story this is. Despite it being a futile effort I want to give you one last chance to watch this without any prior knowledge of the story or the setting.\r\nIf you keep reading from this point you probably won't be any the wiser but I hope I can still spark some interest.\r\nThe story takesplace 1000 years in the future. Mankind has evolved and now has psychic abilities. The protagonist is a young girl and this is the story of her youth or rather her upbringing.\\n\\n\r\nI don't want to give away any details in the story but if I were to describe it in broad strokes I'd say that it makes you question your ethics by blurring the line of what it is to be human. I'd also say that by the end of it you will need to seriously question how you judge people. I don't know how to explain it properly but the reason I say so is that at multiple points in the story I would be surprised just because I was judging a scenario based on how it looked rather than just what was happening. Basically the book & cover thing on another level. I have a really hard time putting this thought into words, sorry.\\n\\n\r\nNothing I have said so far would make the average person want to watch this anime but the appeal of it is in the morals it questions and the \"feels\" you get through watching it.\\n\\n\r\nIn my pathetic attempt to describe this anime I have realized that I'm really just trying to describe an atmosphere so I guess that if you are looking for an immersive story look no further.\\n\\n\r\nEverything contributes to the eerie atmosphere, the soundtrack is great although at some point in the middle of the series you will probably be a bit tired of the most used songs.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is in my opinion outstanding it fits the story perfectly and since I am not the sort of person who can watch something just because it looks pretty I won't say more than that it looks pretty and I don't see any room for improvement really. There have however been complaints of fluctuating production quality, that is as far as I'm concerned nitpicking. I atleast did not notice any change in the production value of either the story or the art through the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe character development is in my opinion rather unique for reasons I won't disclose. However it is also pretty typical so there really isn't much to say about it.\\n\\n\r\nFinally I'd like to stress that this is a whole story - you do not drop something like this halfway through, it may have two or three slow episodes somewhere but that is no excuse.\\n\\n\r\n---\\n\r\nIf you only looked at my ratings you won't read this but I'd like you to know that I have a minor pet peeve with the presentation of one character and that at some point I remembered being tired of some of the soundtrack which is why those two get a 9 instead of 10. I couldn't give it a 10 for enjoyment because of how fucking scary the world is and I'm not a psychopath who enjoys suffering. \\n\r\n---\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr\\n\r\nDon't read the review, watch the anime. That is all.",

Lost. Gods. Power.\r\nShinsekai yori is the type of anime that makes you confused, fall in love with it and then stabs you in the  back as soon as you think youunderstand. Shinsekai yori is a horror drama with a supernatural twist. It's the perfect mix of every one of those genres. This anime is definitely a psychological anime as well due to how many problems each character faces and has to deal with each of them. You see them work through their fears and their happiness. \\n\\n\r\nThe main character is Saki Watanabe, she's a high school student who has many male fans who are seeking her company. The other supporting characters play a major role in Saki's life are Satoru Asahina, Maria Akizuki, Mamoru Itou, Shun Aonuma, and Reiko Amano. They all struggle together and help each other fight through school to harness their powers. However, rumors start to spread about a mysterious cat that starts haunting students for unforeseen reasons until Saki and her group of friends go out hunting for the answers.\\n\\n\r\nDuring the entirety of the anime, it follows Saki and Satoru, mainly, and their fight to save their friends who become hunted by the cat. To find the answer to win, they have to go through a lot of trouble and in the end did they win? What did they really accomplish? Through deceit, Saki achieves what she's after, but what she has lost along the way is very tragic. Although the ending seemed to be a happy one, one can only wonder how much she could be suffering on the inside after such a loss. \\n\\n\r\n8/10 Overall. Would recommend for those who like a good psychological, slightly horror, thriller.",

            "content": "This is one of the most overrated anime out there. Unlike many other anime this one takes a more serious tone but it really devolves into just being an anime that includes the elements that are present in more serious anime rather than tell a good story.\r\nStory\r\nThe story itself is broken into three arcs, this is problematic and would cause the story to suffer. The background of the  story that a sudden outbreak in a few people obtaining telekinesis powers results in dystopian feudalistic future.  The story talks about a few characters and their lives in school and then as adults and theirunderstanding of the world and interactions.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime sets up a premise that has pretty big flaws, ones that it doesn't really address or even provide any sort of explanation for. It simply establishes that somehow people with telekinesis wouldn't continue to wage war among themselves. There is no explanation of what would be created to limit destructive behavior, the viewer would have to simply make a guess.\\n\\n\r\nBecause of the 3 arc format, it means that a lot of elements of the story are just thrown at audience rather than developed. This makes the story appear to be a cliff note version, with elements rapidly introduced and then removed to make room for other ones.\\n\\n\r\nOf the three arcs the first one is remotely watchable, the other two are either weird or boring. The first one explains the world that the characters inhabit and gives away the entire plot, which is government doing shady things. The problem is that because of the formatting or because of the creator\u2019s wish to create an anime that is more \u201cunique\u201d than well developed the plot doesn\u2019t exactly fit, as the explanations for this \u201cshady\u201d behavior isn\u2019t all that shady. The second arc is focused on romance but because of the 3 arc format the story is hastily thrown in together with the characters acting in odd ways making the whole 2nd arc simply odd, weird and just overall pointless. The third arc simply confirms what the audience learned in the first arc, the government does shady things, but not really.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nI cannot say that there is anything all that good about the art. It wasn\u2019t bad just nothing remarkable and interesting. There was a possibility of creating some interesting art but it wasn\u2019t done.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is where this anime does well. The music chosen is pretty spot on but not without its imperfections. That is the music at times is used to create a tense situation when the situation wasn\u2019t tense at all and simply made the whole feeling weird.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\\n\r\nBecause of the 3 arc format the character development is pushed into hyper mode creating major jumps. Nothing interesting is about the characters, they all are their own stereotypes and simply are boring. They don't develop in any sort of way.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nThis anime was one that showed a lot of promise but because the creators wanted to create a unique anime than a good one meant that whole thing just seemed more of a marketing push than anything.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nIt is crap, elements are just thrown in with little to no explanation and everything about this anime was focused on creating a unique one.",

            "content": "Harsh, perfection, desperate, flawless, dark, superstitious, mystery, provoking, thrilling, soul-crushing, depressing. Those are the word I will use to describe Shinsekai yori. This anime is really heavy. It evokes a lot of uncomfortable and uneasy topics, and puts a spotlight on the depravity of mankind and humanity. It sheds a light on the various attitudes of humans toward different kind of issue and their need to dictate everything. \r\nThe problem that arises during the anime is always a food for thought and question to ponder. This anime doesn\u2019t paint anyone as a bad guy or a good guy. The line between evil and justice, goodand bad is so blurred. There is no bad guy in the story, and even the characters that seem to be a bad guy are well rounded, interesting characters, executed in ways you would NEVER expect. It utilizes the world to create a moral ambiguity where everyone is justified with their actions. When I am watching Shinsekai yori, I often have a feeling that I am watching Death Note with no mind game. Both anime is awesome at how it questions the very nature of humans. On what standards that we define and judge ourselves or other are evil or justice?\\n\\n\r\nDoes possess superpower will make our life merrier and happier? Not necessary.  In this show, everyone in the village have psychokinesis(PK) when they reach a certain age. A bless (or rather a curse) comes to the particular individuals indicate they have the cursed power. I love the way the story setting in a society based with the cursed power. Nah, this is not a boring shonen anime that \u201cWe got superpower so we go out and kill some evil guys, getting praised by the head chief and repeat\u201d. This anime does take logical and realistic assumption into its plot which is generally praised by the critics. Having a superpower not necessary lead you to the gateway of happiness, isn\u2019t it?\\n\\n\r\nShin Sekai Yori tells the tale of a group of children born in this \u201cstrange\u201d society (you will know why after you watch the first 15 episodes), and how they grow up with this world and they get ample character development throughout the story. You're in with them for the ride, starting from a clean slate, trying to curiously stumble through this new unknown world. Seeing these characters challenge the status quo of the world and handle with the situations the story throws at them is quite engaging, and the way it\u2019s done is believable and reasonable. The story is dynamic to it where every aspect of the show serves to either develop the world or the characters.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s get to the heart of this gem. What exactly is it that makes Shinsekai yori a masterpiece? I would say that it\u2019s a combination of gradually built-up atmosphere, tension, fantastic storytelling and music. Even in the first few episodes, you can probably feel how dreary and dark situations are. When I am watching episode 1 it already give me quite a blow as I do not expect some blood in the beginning. The setting is definitely something that assists in creating the feeling of being suppressed by a mystery force that screams dystopia (an imagined place or state in which everything is unpleasant or bad). However, as the story progresses, there is many hint and symbolism if you are attention to the detail. This anime WILL force you begin to question almost everything. This leads to the major point that Shinsekai yori excels at, storytelling.\\n\\n\r\nIts outstanding storytelling is the things that make me keep watching until its very end. The cliffhanger at the end of most episodes had successfully evokes the burning desire inside my heart to continue watch Shinsekai yori. The horror and tensive atmosphere make my heart beat run wild at most times. The atmosphere gets me hooked into the story, to experience this weird world with this unique tone with qualities I can't describe. It's so immerse, and it's so well done that everything blends in together and makes for this believable and cohesive experience. It's damn good. The pacing is phenomenal as its started off tense, moved into hopeless, desperate problems and then converted all those problems into hope for the future. This anime is NOT filled with cheesy melodrama but however, it maybe predictable if you have sat down and have a deep thought about the story-line.\\n\\n\r\nLet us talk about the character development. The character in the anime is unique and interesting. As the story advances, the characters have made some incredible transformation as well. The 5 main characters do enhance the overall story. Their conflicting personalities and reaction to various situations made some events in the anime intriguing to watch. My personal favorite character is Saki. As the anime progresses, the bonds between the characters are tested and their lives are focused as they on a journey of discovering certain truths they aren\u2019t supposed to know (It will blow your mind).The history in this show is well-crafted and it enable you to understand more about the present world.  \\n\\n\r\nSide character does have an imperative role too. I personally like one of the \u201cvillain\u201d in this anime (whether he is a villain or not, it remain arguable since I had written that there is no clear line of bad and good in this show). He is cunning and intelligence. He is also willingly to sacrifice and manipulate some individual to achieve his goal. This makes him a little bit similar to Yagami Light (the main character in Death Note). On his early appearance, he appeared to be weak, but the anime does show its noticeable body language which hinted his true character. He is ambitious and does give bring a hell in the most majestic way. He has his own reason to justify his own cruel action and in my opinions, it does not have right and wrong as I probably will do the same thing if I am in his shoes.\\n\\n\r\nThe character and art design is simple yet beautiful. It is not really impressive at a first glance but it is clearly presented. The characters have really expressive eyes and some nice body types to them. I love the ethnic tribal clothes that the characters wear and this is enough to make the characters look good. The environment and background is also very amazing. There are a lot of scenic moments in the anime and I love how they all come to live. The nice angles of the scenes and the mood they set, is always a plus. There is no much of action scene in this anime and is most likely not needed.\\n\\n\r\nThere is no OP in Shinsekai yori. isn\u2019t it strange? There is only one in episode 16 if I am not mistaken. A core part of Shinsekai yori is amazing brilliant music, which is absolutely amazing with great violin that helps supplant the tone into a point of prominence. It supports the story in ways that words could not and amplifying the emotion (still remembers Angel Beats?). At the right times, the right soundtrack is played and the right emotions are conveyed. I had a love with the second ED which is \u201cYuki ni Saku Hana\u201d. Whenever I hear this song, I will always have a urge to cry as it brings the memories of somebody\u2019s death.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending is quite satisfying. It warp up everything and does explain stuff that you like to know. It ends in a way that shows really should end, and I appreciated it. There is no second season, I guess.\\n\\n\r\nI will recommend Shinsekai Yori to all dark anime fans. However, let me give a early warning first: watch it with an open mind. There is some unexpected scene which I don\u2019t want to spoil, but please expect the unexpected. Be aware that Shinsekai Yori is not made to entertain you, it is here to make the best of what it did in quality and writing which it did a great job with. Shinsekai Yori is a very deep and emotional show. Go watch it and be sucked into its world. I was completely attracted to the world it built and I ended up marathon the whole show in 2 days. This is the kind of anime which will worth your time to watch. Shinsekai Yori is my new favorite anime now.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "A community filled with perfection or merely hiding the flaws. That's simply the main story. Simple yet smart. It's those little ideas you see in the anime that will actually change your perspective of the anime.\r\nDuring the season Shinsekai Yori came out, I wasn't really enticed by its story the first time I saw it with all the other flashy animes coming together such as Jojo's Bizarre Adventure and Zetsuen no Tempest -- so in the end, I overlooked Shinsekai Yori.. Oh man was I stupid.\r\nStory: 10\r\nThere are a lot of new words that were flashed in Shinsekai Yori and missing out the meaning ofthese things -- you'll probably get lost in the story line. The level of the anime's climax starts real slow and by 3/4 of the anime the anime starts to evolve into a much serious anime. That 1/4 of the anime, which is nearly at the end, -- it may be small -- but that small portion did escalate my rating for the anime and I'm telling you, my starting rating for the anime wasn't that all too good. The story of the anime was the main attraction of the anime. It may start to confuse you at first (like I experienced) but if you are patient and would like to see the end of it -- the anime starts to create an excitement that is a hundred times more as to what the first episode gave. Oh and the cliff hangers of Shinsekai Yori was the best kind of cliff hangers I've ever watched. From a village who seeks for perfection to something that is actually just a distraction of the truth. Saki with her group of friends are then determined to know more of the truth. Sounds really normal but then the execution of the story is flawless.\\n\r\nThere's always something unique about those stories you could relate or you could see as something real. Stories like Shinsekai Yori would always feel special or more connected. Shinsekai Yori is unique in terms of the generic anime story lines and that's probably what made me love about the anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nThe art is the most talked about in Shinsekai Yori I would guess. The first time I saw episode 1 of Shinsekai Yori it was pure stunning and beautiful that I was even thinking this was beautiful to be edited. Episode 1's art was amazing that it wasn't the story of the anime that kept me want to watch the next episode but it was the art. The first episodes were damn beautiful. I was so enticed by the art -- I was even thinking this could be much better than Guilty Crown's animation.. Then, episode 5 came out.\\n\r\nI did stop watching Shinsekai Yori because of the animation. I couldn't help it. I didn't like it one bit. I always remembered episode 5 -- \"the start of the weird animation\". I couldn't help myself continue watching Shinsekai Yori because it was difficult with all the weird angles, the horrible focus, the unmatched emotions to the character's' dialogues and the proportions were awkward. It took me months till I started to watch Shinsekai Yori again and once I started to continue watching it -- the art wasn't much likely to bother anymore. Yes, the art was weird but I did see the importance of the story and how the story pushed this anime to the top without the help of any other element but the plot in itself.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nI guess the low cut budget of the anime made also low use of sounds and little flashy OSTs but the sound effects and the music were dead on amazing, epic and very grand -- it gives me goosebumps. Little music was perfect for this anime. I can't help but feel that the serious music was making this anime such of high class. The dubbing though was flawless most especially squealer's and the queerats'.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nNot much of any character development but if you're a Shinsekai Yori fan like me -- you'll feel so attached to each of the characters. I know I did. When the anime ended, I was so lost. I wanted the characters all to myself. I felt like something was missing in me. The characters had all different personalities -- strong ones, calm ones and even paranoid ones so the characters were pretty much helping to ease the complicated story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\n\"Very complex.\" That was what I thought. I wasn't enjoying the first episodes to be honest because there were so much information that were coming and not much anything to do with the present episodes. I was really struggling to get the hype of the anime and the urge to finish it. But later on, when the episodes were nearing to its episode 20s, the story gets more flashy and those unwanted information I got during the first episodes suddenly turned into something useful and I was able to enjoy the whole series that easily. I don't even know why I enjoyed the anime so much when I was nearly confused with its first episodes but as I go on the climax of the anime made this anime really exciting and stunning.\\n\\n\r\nOver-all: 10\\n\r\nWith all the flaws, I still say the story made such great influence in the anime that those animation flaws didn't matter anymore. It was creative in every other way. Shinsekai Yori gives more than what a usual anime can present.\\n\\n\r\nMy only tip for you for this anime is to watch it all throughout the end and just keep on understanding the situation from the first episode till the last. It's amazing how you'll get by with it.",

It's a plot that's been done before, but I don't think it detracts from the quality of it.\r\nThe story flows well - even when the anime feels a bit jumpy, it actually goes with the mood, and there are no plot holes, despite the plot being complicated. Everything is tiedin together sooner or later, and I must also compliment them on the way they carried this out. It tends to bother me when an anime piles up all of the mysteries for the very end, so it felt refreshing to see many secrets explained right away, while only some were left for later (though enough to keep the audience interested).\\n\r\nThe story itself is extremely interesting as well, even though it's made up of very classic elements. It kept me drawn in throughout, and I didn't feel like I was losing interest or concentration at any point.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is very pretty, and flows well. I personally did not like certain scenes, and the size of the characters' eyes, but those are very subjective reasons so I'm not going to elaborate on this bit.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe music is fitting, especially at certain scenes, and maintains the atmosphere extremely well. The ending songs were very good too.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nNone of the characters are bland, even the less important ones. Character development is very evident throughout, and most importantly - it's never static at all. I know some would suggest that certain scenes related to character relationships were not necessary, but I think they were important for getting to know the characters and their dynamics.\\n\r\nWhile the difference between 'good guys' and 'bad guys' (behavior-wise) is a bit obvious for my taste, I think the way the characters act and think (and how those ways (do not) change) was realistic and well carried out.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI would definitely recommend Shinsekai Yori to everyone. Even if you're not a SciFi fan (I personally don't usually like it), it's an outstanding watch that is sure to keep you glued to your seat.",

            "content": "It is without a doubt that Shinsekai Yori leaves you in a state of relief. It takes a path astray and fearlessly tackles human nature/values.\r\nI feel that people are not giving this anime a chance. The first half of Shinsekai Yori has a notably slow start and because of this, a number of people have dropped the series. I too, make up a portion of the people who were not too fond of the sedate start. Do note, however, that most of the scenes played in the early episodes has some sort of significance in the latter half of the series. Despite the snail-paced start,I pulled through, finished the series, and Shinsekai Yori is now my favourite anime. Also it\u2019s better than if it had a remarkably good start but having the rest of the series drenched in a pile of shit.\\n\\n\r\nShinsekai Yori definitely packs a punch in terms of arousing your emotions. You\u2019re guaranteed to direct your anger at certain individuals due to their unjustifiable actions. There are also moments of pleasure in which the anime takes an intermission from the dark and serious atmosphere. Lastly, you just can\u2019t help but sympathize towards some of the characters due to a predicament of some sort. Although were given the perspective and focus of only the main protagonist, Saki, you\u2019ll find yourself captivated by some of the other characters.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes this anime so great is the plot, which truly is mind-boggling. Shinsekai Yori's take on the future is really creative. It seems unrealistic in a sense (villages and such), but it makes sense as to how everything came to be. Again, after the slow start, were given back-to-back episodes in which the plot just continues to develop and buildup for the climax. \\n\\n\r\nShinsekai Yori is a series that delivers a deep and meaningful message. It has one of the most well done finales that wraps everything ever so nicely; the way it concluded could not have been any better. Shinsekai Yori is arguably the best anime of 2012 and can be considered a masterpiece to some extent.",

I honestly thought this anime would be a cutesy school life kind of anime (mostly only because of the picture) and was I wrong. I'm glad I was though!\r\nStory (10): I would say the story is complex, but in a good way. It's definitely interesting for sure. It's bizarre, dark, and thought compelling. I loved the unique take on the Utopian society that revolves around this story. There were times I was touched, there were moments I cried, most of all, there were momentsI found myself saying \"What the f***!\" It was nothing at all like what I expected it to be, it was so much better! \\n\\n\r\nArt (10): The art was fantastic. I loved the colors, how fluid it was and how beautiful (or in certain cases grotesque) things were. \\n\\n\r\nSound (10): I have to say, the voice actors did fantastic jobs with their characters. The sound effects were also great. The biggest thing I have to commend is the music, it was absolutely lovely. I especially loved the first ending, such a great song. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10): Probably my most favorite thing about this anime were the characters, human and non human. Since the story goes in stages of the main heroine Saki's life, it's amazing to see how everything develops among them. There's so much unexpected twists and turns, and it was great seeing how each of the characters progressed. It's funny to me that Saki wasn't my favorite character, but to be honest, I love that it was all told in her perspective. I feel that the characters really do a great job with drawing you into the whole plot.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this series significantly. Right after I finished watching it, I went and recommended it to my friends who also enjoyed it as well. I even went on to read the novel version. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is great. I'm probably going to rewatch it in the future. I know all I did was praise it, but I honestly did not have anything bad to say about this anime. I won't go as far as saying it was perfect, I'm sure it had it's flaws, but to me I didn't find any worth giving bad criticisms. I will admit that I did not review this right after watching it, I actually watched it quite some time ago, but to this day, the impression it left on me was a great one. So definitely give this anime a chance if you haven't already!",

            "content": "Shinsekai Yori is a great intelligent, psychological anime which starts out somewhat confusing but still interesting right from the beginning though it doesn\u2019t really get going until about episode 3 or 4. This is the story of civilization in Japan about 1000 years ahead of the present day and in the same universe as the one we live in (aside from the whole \u201canime\u201d thing). In the future, everyone can use \u201cCantus,\u201d an ability (one of my favorite anime powers ever) that can do everything from repairing glass jars to levitating people to setting things on fire to killing things, though there are many limitationson that last part. It follows 5 kids who you get to see grow up, mature, and fight battles to protect humanity while at the same time suffering many tragedies. This show is much heavier on drama than comedy, so be warned that while it isn\u2019t exactly an After Story or AnoHana it is still a very emotional show that delves into many psychological aspects of the characters as well as our whole outlook on humanity and what we all are. One thing you may have heard about this show is the one yaoi scene and the three or four yuri scenes (none of which have anything more than kissing). These actually have a purpose in the show and the reason is explained several episodes prior to any of these scenes. I didn\u2019t find them distracting in the least while watching this show.\\n\\n\r\nBefore I get started I\u2019ll just say that I give Shinsekai Yori (From the New World in English) a 10/10 in every category because I just can\u2019t think of a reason to give it a 9/10 or anything lower. I would definitely say this show is the best anime of 2012 (at least of what I\u2019ve seen).\\n\\n\r\nStory: I really can\u2019t say much about the story, since almost anything I say would give away spoilers. Let me just say though that Shinsekai Yori keeps you guessing about what will come next. It has many clever and surprising plot twists and at the beginning of this series you will have no idea how this show is going to end. The ending, I think, is well done though I have heard some people say they thought it was rushed a little.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is interesting. At first I wasn\u2019t so sure it was worthy of a perfect score, but after watching the whole series I believe this is the best rating. The landscape, the character designs, and some of the more psychological scenes are well animated and nice to look at. With the characters growing up during the show, it\u2019s nice to see that at each age they still look just as good as they did when they were younger.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The soundtrack is one of the best I\u2019ve ever heard. Despite not having any opening themes, there are two good ending themes with the first being my favorite of the two. While Squealer\u2019s voice did annoy me at first, I got used to it as the show went on. The rest of the voice actors do a great job portraying the emotion of their characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The five main characters are Saki, Satoru, Maria, Mamoru, and Shun. Unfortunately, like the story, I can\u2019t really tell you much about them so I\u2019ll just give my thoughts on them instead. Watanabe Saki is the protagonist and the story is told from her POV. Saki is a fantastic protagonist and probably my favorite female protagonist. Satoru is the main male character and along with Saki tends to act as the leader. Maria acts as the motherly character while Mamoru is the weakest of the characters emotionally and is often scared (for good reason) of getting involved in the trouble the other characters get into. Shun is a very skilled boy who is in line to take over one of the highest positions in the settlement that the characters live in. Aside from these characters there are also two important Queerats (I also saw them called goblin Rats in the subs), Squealer and Kiroumaru. The Queerats look up to the humans as gods and live under them. They come in many different forms but usually they look like short, human-shape naked mole rats. I found Squealer very annoying at first, but towards the end of the series I felt just as many feelings from him as the main characters and I actually grew to like him a lot due to just a couple scenes. Kiroumaru is a taller Queerat from a different tribe than Squealer. In addition to these characters there are many humans that play relatively important roles, but I found most of them more forgettable for the most part since they get less screen time and blend into the crowd more than the above characters though that\u2019s not to say they were boring. Mostly it was just because they were not included in the series until over halfway through it.\\n\\n\r\nShinsekai Yori has easily become one of my favorite anime series. One warning I should give is that, this show does have a decent amount of gore especially in the latter half. I also found some scenes were bordering on the horror genre through the use of suspense (again mostly in the latter half). Still I would recommend this to anyone who likes intelligent anime like Death Note or shows that delve into the \u201care we in the right or wrong\u201d psychological look at humanity like Shiki.\\n\\n\r\nOne final note, I\u2019ll just mention one of my favorite aspects of this show which is how the human race is compared to a colony of bonobos (you'll get it if you watch the show).",

            "content": "Shinsekai Yori presents a startling commentary on humanity and the structure of society. Its countless warnings, the cautionary tale of what our power means, and the juxtaposition of a futuristic and slightly fantastical world with our own are aspects that I would never have put within the ability of anime to convey. The intricacies of the plot left me in awe; though it seems incredibly confusing at first, it\u2019s when the pieces of the puzzle start to come together that Shinsekai Yori attains its greatest effect. The realization of the truths that are very much, and very frighteningly, applicable to our own world left mein awe. \\n\\n\r\nIt looks innocent, but it\u2019s extremely dark and psychological, and gives you a lot to think about. After watching this anime, I had to take a week to gather my thoughts coherently enough to write this review. It challenges not simply society, but what makes us human. I never thought I would be saying this about an anime, but Shinsekai Yori completely changed my outlook on the world. And it was amazing. \\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019ve read some of my reviews, you know that the path diverges here. A bit like a choose-your-own-adventure, perhaps? If you like flowing text, keep reading; if you prefer numbers, scroll down further. Or read both, if you like, but information can and will be repeated between categories. Without further ado, here\u2019s my attempt at reviewing an anime that I will never completely understand. \\n\\n\r\n-\\n\\n\r\nA short synopsis for you all. Six children - Saki, Maria, Mamoru, Satoru, Reiko, and Shun, are the best of friends, living in a utopian society with others who possess the power of psychokinesis ( which will be referred to, for the sake of brevity, as PK ). The society that they live is disturbingly peaceful. Everything seems to go perfectly; too perfectly, in fact. People remain as long as they are willing to adhere to the rules and are not abnormal, whether that means with some strange personality or lagging behind in abilities. The reason for this elimination is revealed later on. Yet in the beginning of Shinsekai Yori, all is well. It is revealed that they live in a somewhat post-apocalyptic world; the reason for the apocalypse and the lack of technology is unknown. The infrastructure of the community is built on the labor of Monster Rats, which believe the PK users to be gods and address them with a respect that seems exaggerated, and eerily so. \\n\\n\r\nAfter a watershed incident, the children discover that there is much more to the past of their society than they imagined. The story gets progressively darker as more truths become evident. Many of the aspects of the series are confusing and may cause people to abandon the show, yet everything has its own place. Chekhov\u2019s gun plays a major role in this series. Everything, even little snippets from the very beginning of the show, are crucial to how the story plays out. I can remember the point where all facts that had seemed, initially, unrelated, began to come together. That moment was astonishing. I had no words. It made sense and I understood the truth, and the truth was terrifying. \\n\\n\r\nShinsekai Yori draws most of its impact from the concept that almost everything in this anime is paralleled in the world we live in. PK? Weird balloon-dogs? Magic, in general? None of that exists in our world, perhaps, but upon further examination, our world has equivalents of the colorful array of abilities, ideas, and characters in the anime. There are countless themes interwoven in this anime, all of which find a place in our world. How far can we go before our actions can be termed \u2018abusing our power\u2019? When, if ever, is it right to kill somebody? What makes us human? Indeed, Shinsekai Yori is filled with haunting questions that will make those who pay attention doubt even their very existence. The story is complex. It\u2019s quite difficult to follow, admittedly, which is why I recommend trying to watch it all at once instead of leaving it off and watching it sporadically. Yet I believe that of all the anime I have watched, even Miyazaki films, Shinsekai Yori is one with messages that need to be heard. Nothing is as it seems in this anime. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I believe is one of the best aspects of Shinsekai Yori\u2019s character portrayal is that nobody is good or evil. Even the main antagonists are justified in their beliefs. The protagonists make questionable decisions. Yet, as becomes evident throughout the anime, it is those who are willing to bend the rules and take risks that have the most impact, whether they are \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018bad\u2019. I do not feel as though there is much character development in this anime as there is a greater realization of the truth. The main character, Saki, for example, retains much of the same personality and beliefs that she had at the beginning of the anime, but it is her growing knowledge that makes her significantly different from her childhood self. \\n\\n\r\nI guess I should stop being loquacious and talk about other parts of Shinsekai Yori, so, let\u2019s begin with the art. The characters themselves are simply drawn, with features that are there simply to distinguish themselves from each other. They have no outstanding characteristics in terms of appearance, in contrast with the Monster Rats, who have a wide variety of forms and may not even be associated with each other if not for being explicitly termed all of the same species. Even so, it\u2019s necessary to understand that anyone with a particularly unique appearance might be eliminated under the extremely conformist society. In addition, the simple character designs remind you that this anime is not about the appearances. It is about the plot, about analyzing even the smallest details and realizing what they mean. The background art is amazing and detailed, in contrast with the human character designs. The world of Shinsekai Yori looks at once familiar and surreal. There\u2019s just enough use of foreign aspects to indicate that this is a fantasy land. Lastly, I\u2019d like to mention the use of dark and light shadowing. Much of this anime is shown in a dark setting, which makes the scenes that are extremely bright that much more significant. It greatly aids in emphasizing the importance of various parts of the story.\\n\\n\r\nMany, including me, were probably surprised to find that there was no outstanding OP for this anime. The episodes start immediately. There is, however, a recurring theme that plays in the background, a kind of ethereal melody that matches the somewhat futuristic, somewhat mysterious tone of Shinsekai Yori, and a wonderfully presented ending. In a significantly different animating style from the anime, it\u2019s definitely one of the most impressive endings I\u2019ve seen in an anime, even though it\u2019s quite simple. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s pretty evident by now, I think, that I wholeheartedly enjoyed this anime. But I suppose I should give some consideration as to why you might choose not to watch this anime. It is an investment of time and brainpower, since you really have to think and rethink about many parts of Shinsekai Yori before you can reach somewhat of an understanding of what\u2019s going on and what everything means. Heh, I feel like I\u2019m writing a warning label here. But you might not really want to watch Shinsekai Yori if you can\u2019t stand homosexuality- it\u2019s not a major feature of the anime and its reasons are fully explained well before it actually appears, you\u2019re looking for a lighthearted anime, you\u2019re not really interested in paying a lot of attention to it, or you\u2019re the type that prefers everything resolved, no questions unanswered, and all parts of the show making complete sense. I\u2019m sure that I missed a lot of messages in this anime. Even small details have significance. \\n\r\n-\\n\\n\r\nThanks for waiting, to those of you who prefer numbers. \\n\\n\r\nStory - 10\\n\r\nAnd a well-deserved 10 at that. Shinsekai Yori starts off simple, gets rather confusing, and then, suddenly, everything starts to come together and make sense. The innumerable themes presented in this anime were astounding. I actually have no idea how the author managed to tie everything together while also making some rather poignant statements and, at times, sardonic criticism, about our present-day society. Every little detail has significance to the plot...would you call it the butterfly effect, perhaps, in that even the seemingly smallest actions have massive effects? Emerson wrote that society regresses just as fast as it advances, and I think this is quite evident in Shinsekai Yori, in which a utopian world exists...but at what price? To understand Shinsekai Yori, you have to be willing to analyze everything until you think all of the meanings have been completely exhausted, and then look at them from a different perspective and realize how much you\u2019ve missed. The anime does a lot in terms of story, but there\u2019s also a necessity for the watcher to have their own thoughts for Shinsekai Yori to make its full impact.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8\\n\r\nCharacter designs are simple and definitely not flamboyant or exotic in any way. They are easily distinguished from each other, but have no significant features. A greater diversity is present in the Monster Rats ( I believe this has some rather interesting implications, but you\u2019ll figure that out when you watch the anime ). The animation gets a little bit strange in some of the episodes, but most of the anime is well-drawn. The background art is well-done, and the careful manipulation of dark and light helps set the mood of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 7\\n\r\nThe music is definitely unconventional, with just a hint of surreal and a dose of eerie to finish it off. There is no consistent OP ( as I recall, a song appeared in the beginning in just, perhaps, two of the episodes? ), but there are two EDs, both of which I enjoyed; Wareta Ringo is incredibly catchy. They are well-animated and may seem incredibly bewildering initially but make a lot more sense as the anime progresses. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 9\\n\r\nThe characters do not develop so much as their greater knowledge of the truths- or shall I say lies?- that their world is built on changes their outlook on everything that they learned as children. I appreciate how not even the antagonists are portrayed as necessarily evil. Everyone is equally justified in their beliefs and if you\u2019re willing to look at Shinsekai Yori from each character\u2019s point of view, none of the motives seem inherently evil. Sacrifices must be made in one aspect to gain in another. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\r\nThis anime proved to me that what many may deem children\u2019s cartoons can have surprisingly meaningful messages. Though I expected to enjoy this anime, it almost completely consumed my thoughts for about a week afterward as I tried to puzzle out, well, first of all, why I enjoyed it so much, and secondly, what did everything that I had just watched mean not only in a proverbial sense but also in an applicable-to-society sense? I was completely hooked on Shinsekai Yori from the beginning, which is something I\u2019ve never really experienced with an anime before. It was indeed interesting solving the countless mysteries of the Shinsekai Yori world alongside the characters.\\n\\n\r\n-\\n\\n\r\n\u201cSometimes, the truth is the cruelest thing of all\u201d.\\n\r\nThank you for reading! \\n",

            "content": "Shinsekai yori was an absolute delight to watch and reflect on. Not only is it a very intelligent anime, but it consistently keeps viewers enchanted by beautiful environment art, thrilling action, heart-pounding suspense, and sudden plot twists right to the final episode.\r\nThought-provoking, insightful, and beautifully animated with an intriguing and original story arc, it's quite fantastic what the creators managed to pack into 25 episodes. It's simply brilliant. \r\nIf you're looking for an anime with a completely different feel than what most animes bring to the table, you've found it. Shinsekai yori is a very intelligent anime when appreciated to its fullest. If you're lookingfor a rapid-fire, guts-and-glory, good-versus-evil kind of anime, you might not enjoy this series. It's unique style and melancholy, almost dark feel won't appeal to everybody, as it does not exist purely for mindless entertainment. It will challenge you. Excite you. Blow your mind in such a subtle way you won't really know what to do with yourself at times.\\n\\n\r\n This anime's many conflicts occur within many gray areas; it is not always clear whether the antagonists are truly evil in nature. In other words, it comes off as quite strikingly real, even within a very surreal, dreamlike environment. Although it is, at its most basic, a story based on a group of friends' triumphs and failures, and ultimately a task to save the world from destruction, it brings a pensive, melancholy subtlety that really sets it apart.\\n\\n\r\nThe character development is also subtle, but genius. Observing the differences and changes the children go through as they interact with each other into adolescence is very unique and tangible to observe. It's sort of a coming-of-age story with much darker notions. Shinsekai yori is not afraid to directly expose themes and ideas that many shy away from and avoid thinking about. Indeed, it can get quite dark at times. It brings angsty and dramatic undertones that really complement the overall feel that really makes this anime what it is.\\n\\n\r\nThe story picks up speed quite suddenly, and action-packed episodes are layered with quieter, story-based episodes in such a way that neither gets tiring. The story's focus switches from topic to topic in a very realistic way: not always crystal-clear to look back on, but clear enough that the viewer doesn't wind up lost in the whimsical, surreality of it all. Shinsekai yori exists in a world based on what-ifs, and it makes for a rather personal experience that can vary greatly in meaning just varying on who's watching.\\n\\n\r\nI find that one of the factors that truly makes or breaks any anime is the complexity of idea it is based on. Shinsekai yori hit the nail on the head for me. Not only did this anime leave me pausing episodes quite frequently simply to take in certain themes and ideas, but it explores many societal norms and themes in a very insightful and original way. The world that it takes place in alone, both primal and complex in nature, leaves much to be pondered and appreciated. The sheer amount of detail put into this anime cannot be appreciated by simply watching episode after episode. It requires time to mull things over and digest what you've seen. \\n\\n\r\n (Note: There is a LOT of backstory and world-explanation portrayed to the viewer rather quickly and frequently for the length of the anime. I find the creators did an excellent job with this medium, however, it is important that the viewer pays attention during explanations, as the story development can be quite complex and direct, and is vital to fully experience the depth of this anime.)\\n\\n\r\nThe animation itself is also very beautiful. Stunning environment art, charming and gorgeous character design, and the sheer vastness of the world created in this anime rival any other I've seen to date. To put it simply, the aesthetics easily match the story quality in terms of absolute pleasure and enjoyment. \\n\\n\r\nSo, all in all, this anime is a gem worth seeing, even if you've never watched this sort of anime before. I hadn't when I first saw it, and it was very refreshing to experience an anime that broke the mold in such a way. Please take my word for it-- it's amazing. Shinsekai yori gets tens across the board from me, and deserves it completely.",

            "content": "Can you imagine our world being a utopia a 1000 years into the future? No wars and just peace and love and tranquility? I doubt it. But, if you were to see such a utopia, you probably would have a gut feeling for it to be wrong. Shinsekai Yori tells us to remember that instinctive feeling...\r\nShinsekai Yori documents the lives of humans 1000 years into the future who have gained the ability of using psychokinesis (commonly referred to as cantus). The story follows the life of Saki Watanabe and friends who go to Zenjin academy to hone their cantus skills, and their investigations about themystery 'tainted cats'.\\n\\n\r\nShinsekai Yori is seen as a fantasy thriller, trying to delicately weave in high suspense moments in an idyllic setting whilst using children to uncover the dark secrets of how the world has come about.  The clever juxtaposing techniques are what bring about the tension.  However, underneath this complex story, what we see is a slice of life.  Not an ordinary slice of life, but the 'slice' which is never really looked at in anime too often.  It's the negatives about our world which are expressed fully in the Shinsekai Yori, every flaw in our imperfect world are scrutinized in depth. There are so many parallels between our world and their world, from using 'unintelligent' creatures (in Shinsekai Yori these are named Queerats) as slaves, to the brainwashing of society or even forcing dictatorship and judgement on the weak, are well documented. Furthermore, it also looks at how those in control sanction such inhumane laws on those who could cause risk to society, going as far as brainwashing people to maintain control.  The show can almost been seen as consisting of 3 arcs which involves time skips to show life at different ages, mainly focusing on the problems with the children and the other focuses on the war at the end.  Atmospherically, the show oozes tense undertones in comparison to the cheery nature of the children and the lush scenery.  The show also features romance, but not the human conventional falling in love, it's more instinctive love, which gave for truly unique displaying of relationships.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, one of the biggest criticisms of the show was the radical changing of themes in terms of relationships. Quiet early into the show both yaoi and yuri themes were shown, which was a stark contrast to the possible relationship pairings previously established. Furthermore, the pacing was back and forth due flashbacks of the history in shinsekai yori, which made it slightly hard to follow, however this stops and the pacing becomes better, adding more tension.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation for the show wasn't entirely fluid or sharp compared to many anime's in 2012, however the art isn't bad either. There is some bloody moments, all of which isn't censored. The scenery itself is done well, not necessarily picturesque but good nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in shinsekai yori are fleshed out by showing their mental 'strength', this strength shown by the characters is how they manage to overcome problems which provide extremely stressful. When younger, the characters come across as a common cast of friends, such as the smart one (Shun) the quiet one (Mamarou) or the cocky one (Satoru). But as they grow you see the strength of these characters. The show does well in presenting difficult situations for the characters, and sympathy can only be given to see children so young deal with so much that they may not understand, such as political issues or certain laws. Also, the killing off of characters shows no one is safe at any point, and the characters are put under the stress of knowing this constantly.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, it could be seen that Saki, the main character and narrator of the show gets off lightly with some issues. Although she struggles and is able to cope well, she is known to be weak in terms of fighting, which could lead to big problems at times. But, she generally good for most of the show.\\n\\n\r\nMusically, Shinsekai Yori shines brightly. Although the shows opening isn't used much (if not at all) it's 2 choices of ending are definitely good for those who love more romantic J Pop. The OST is composed very well, with each terrifying moment made that bit more tense, and the more relaxing moments that bit more peaceful.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, this genre within a genre anime is definitely worth watching for someone looking for anime which is slightly unique. It's one not to miss, as an anime like Shinsekai Yori doesn't come across too often.",

            "content": "Shinsekai Yori has all the elements of a modern classic. Containing ethnical conundrums and indistinguishable villains, the sprawling story is set in a world both fantastical and believable. Multiple times will you feel uncomfortable watching it, the series' slow pace boring you or the depiction of homosexuality unsettling you. It doesn't immediately make sense nor explain itself, but that could be said to be part of the charm.\r\nThis aforementioned charm comes from multiple facets of the series. \r\nFirstly, as was hinted to earlier, the story is grand and well made. Even from the beginning episodes a feeling of dread and wonder is bestowed onto theviewer. I found myself wanting to know more about the story, the characters and the mysteries unfolding before me, the series every alluding to something much grander. Although this world building within the first few episodes could be seen as trivial and boring, to me it was engaging and refreshing. It introduced the setting and story well and gave you a taste of what was to come; no filler or episodic dilemmas negating from the plot. This fascination stayed with me for the whole duration, the maturity of the plot growing with the episode count. In this way the series really builds upon itself, most details being important to the overall story. Although not fully noticeable until later on, this therefore allows Shinsekai Yori to tie everything together into a satisfying conclusion. Due to this, the story kept me engaged well and it's twists and turns (although predictable) served to create a daunting and sinister narrative throughout.\\n\\n\r\nAnother aspect of the series which complements it's good story are the characters. This is done mainly through the way they grow and change throughout the story. This is seen not only visually with the passage of time, but also through the development of their morals and figure. As such, this serves to both privilege the grim themes of the central story and allow for further actions to take place. Therefore, most, if not all, characters get their deserved screen time and fully develop into something worth caring for. The reason this is a strength for the series is because it means all characters are interesting. No one clich\u00e9 is truly seen in the cast and this adds to the previously mentioned want for information and knowledge. You are constantly hungering for that little bit of detail to each character and plough through the story to get it. The moral ambiguity and troubles in locating a main villain also help this. There is no defacto 'bad guy' nor knight in shining armour; everyone and everything is morally grey and you find yourself second guessing most interior motives. This, coupled with the little to no fan-service in the anime, helps to establish the central, mature themes. Ultimately, this aids the series and supports the rollercoaster that is the main story.\\n\\n\r\nMy main gripes with Shinsekai Yori is the varying animation quality and pacing. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough the two ending songs and main themes of the series were well made, the same cannot be said for the visuals at times. Noticeable dips in quality can be seen scattered throughout Shinsekai Yori, the revaluation of characters being incredibly jarring for single episodes. Lazily animated cycles and poorly done poses were easily visible and did subtract from the main narrative, though thankfully this never occurred during essential moments. Additionally, the standard artwork of the series is nothing truly spectacular either. Yes, it does serve its purpose, and yes, the characters and backdrops do look beautiful at times, but it didn't quite have its own style or fidelity. However, it did suit the story well, the less generic characters and environment portraying a more adult world. In the same way this animation style suited the more surreal scenes well, the use of effects helping to create a spectacle. Due to this, the art of Shinsekai Yori is highly variable, though is nothing which could solely put off a viewer. \\n\\n\r\nSomething which could drop viewers, however, is the initial pacing of the story. As was mentioned, I highly enjoyed the slow burn of the story and character development throughout. What I do not appreciate, however, is the stark change in tone found within the first action plot line. Although remedied after-the-fact with better execution in further arks, I cared very little for early episodes because of this. It seemed to me that the story cared less about building upon its previous mysteries and more about the plight and battles against Queerats. Additionally, coupled with poor animation throughout this section, the beginning segment has the possibility of turning away viewers from an otherwise fantastic series. Although purely subjective and biased, I find that this section is the worst example of pacing and goes against the grand story proposed in the episodes beforehand. As such, poor pacing is made apparent only in the starting section and highlights the flaws of the series. \\n\\n\r\nMore than anything, Shinsekai Yori will be a different experience. It contains few of the tropes common in the anime and closely resembles it's novel roots. It is highly enjoyable if you can stomach it's themes, artwork and pacing and enjoy it for the experience it offers. Little can match the work on the quality of its story, and I suggest all people to give it a shot.",

            "content": "Shin Sekai Yori is a striking anime; a superb supernatural drama that excels in crafting and executing a captivating story. It\u2019s mystifying, futuristic world is riddled with dark and disturbing secrets just waiting to be uncovered. It is very unfortunate that some people will drop this anime due to its almost painfully slow pacing. But stick around with SSY and you\u2019ll be in for a real treat. \r\nThe story and world are where this anime truly shines. SSY takes place in a gorgeous utopia, 1000 years in the future. Each human being possesses psychic powers, ruling the entire world at the very top of thefood chain. The story follows Saki Watanabe as she recounts her haunting journey toward finding out the truth behind her seemingly perfect world. It\u2019s an all too familiar formula, yet Shin Sekai Yori manages to spin a brand new tale that still feels refreshing and interesting. \\n\\n\r\nNoticing the various themes, subtleties, and intricate details stuck into the overall plot is almost necessary to fully appreciate the story. One of the joys of the show is slowly uncovering the rich and sometimes disturbing history of the world. It\u2019s clear that care was put into crafting the world and the story. The first two episodes fool the viewer into thinking this is going to be a happy go lucky tale about some innocent school kids and their magic. But the third episode changes all that, giving the main characters and the viewer their first peek into the truth about their nasty world. In the first few episodes, Saki, who serves as the narrator, also hints that this seemingly average tale is about to get much darker. In fact, there are quite a few clever instances of foreshadowing scattered throughout the show. SSY promises that it\u2019s going to deliver, and it doesn\u2019t disappoint. \\n\\n\r\nThe first half is paced quite slowly, yet it serves a purpose. During the anime, three time skips happen, so the slow pacing was a nice way of not making the anime feel like it jumped around abruptly for no reason. In the beginning, Saki and her friends are but babes; twelve years old and na\u00efve about the world they live in. This time serves to establish the relationship between the five friends, as well as introduce the Monster rats and their role in the world. The anime then skips ahead two years, and this is where things began to pick up. More of the truth about their world is uncovered, prompting some troubling events that end up driving the five friends apart. \\n\\n\r\nOne other interesting tidbit about the story and world is its use of sexuality. It\u2019s a bit of a surprise when you first see how relationships and sexuality are explored in this futuristic world of theirs. Fortunately, it\u2019s just one small aspect of the show that is mentioned in the beginning episodes and then briefly viewed after the first time skip. It\u2019s not overblown or used as a distracting means to titillate the audience. It\u2019s just one more aspect of their world that sticks out as particularly unusual.\\n\\n\r\nThe second time skip is where things really start to pick up for the better. The first two arcs mostly served to introduce the characters and the different aspects of the world. From episode 17 and on, SSY takes an abrupt turn to the dark and horrifying. Shocking secrets unlike any of the ones revealed before are thrown out into the opening. The atmosphere is intense and terrifying, leaving the viewer with feelings of anticipation, awe, and unease. And I of course mean that in a positive way. In its essence SSY is one those \u201cmindfuck animes.\u201d But here\u2019s the catch. There\u2019s subtlety in its delivery. While some anime will be intent on showing you horrific and shocking scenes of intense violence simply for shock value or shoehorned in plot twists (that usually end up creating plot holes) to \u201cmindfuck\u201d the viewer, SSY does this with a little class and intelligence.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, there\u2019s no denying that this anime has its share of violence. But it\u2019s intent to crawl into the viewer\u2019s brain and under their skin doesn\u2019t come from its instances of intense violence. While those are horrifying in their own right, the real horror comes from finding out the truth about the human society. The real horror is finding out the sheer ugliness of the things they tried so hard to cover up. The big reveal at the end is the icing on the cake. The story and world are the real horrific parts of this anime. The atmosphere and the violence merely complement them.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the characters. Unfortunately, they play second banana to the story. They are very good characters of course, but compared to the story, not quite as much detail or development were given to them, aside from maybe Saki. Saki, the main lead and the narrator, serves as a sort of proxy for the viewer. Through her eyes, we too uncover the ugly secrets of her world. Interestingly enough, most of the other main characters, aside from Satoru, are mostly used to  reveal some secret of the world. The side characters are mostly people presented to give the viewer some much needed info. None of them particularly shine. The Monster Rats also made for some surprisingly interesting characters. Though this doesn\u2019t really come to light until the later episodes. \\n\\n\r\nStudio A-1 pictures has once again outdone themselves with the art and animation. They\u2019ve crafted a beautiful and vibrant world that is a joy to look at. Some of the shots of the world might as well be classified as scenery porn. In contrast, when the story calls for it, dark and chilling backdrops are also presented, slathered with dark tones and heavy shadows. The soundtrack gets the same treatment, filled with slow, haunting tracks. The characters aren\u2019t neglected either. Each of them is given a unique and aesthetically pleasing appearance. A small noticeable detail would also be the funky clothes they\u2019re given throughout the series. They\u2019re very interesting, looking like a cross between modern clothing and traditional Japanese clothing. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Shin Sekai Yori is an excellent anime. It\u2019s a chilling tale that will leave you impressed long after you\u2019ve finished it. It slow paced and subtle story actually end up working in the anime\u2019s favor. It\u2019s detailed and intricate story as well as its themes will leave the viewer immensely satisfied in the end. Some of the best kinds of stories are the one that make you feel emotion, and boy will this anime invoke plenty of that. It\u2019s a spectacular show that shouldn\u2019t be missed by anyone. \\n",

            "content": "Were you looking for another hilarious romcom about kids in school? Well, then you should leave. From the cover/poster picture, that's what this series had me thinking at first. But boy was I wrong, what I got was a dark, clever, and very suspensful anime. Towards the end of this series, the episodes started to feel like they were only 2 minutes long. I was wanting to give this a 9 out of 10 for a while, but I couldn't bring myself to it. Nothing was at all bad about Shin Sekai Yori.\r\nStory:\r\nDefinitely the high point of the series. With most series nowadays, the storyis pretty predictable, but with this one, I had absolutely no idea what was coming during several events, even when I tried to make an inference, most of the time, I was wrong. It was both original and intriguing. I was sucked into the story and kept wanting more. I swear that not a single line of dialogue was wasted, it felt like every line was related to something that would happen in the future. There were a few moments that I thought were a little... strange though. You'll know what I'm talking about if you've seen/are gonna watch this series. \\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation:\\n\r\nThere was just something about the art style that was different, I can't quite say what it is, maybe the characters? I'm not sure, it was quite unique though. One thing about the art that really got me was the backgrounds and settings. There was a noticeable amount of detail put into the backgrounds. I also really love the designs of the different creatures that were in the series. Animation wise, holy crap it was awesome! Words cannot describe it. The more \"actiony\" scenes were stunning to say the least. The animation during the ED never got old. I never felt the need to skip it.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe OST was pretty amazing. Music wasn't always present, but when the time was right, adding the music in definitely made the scene have a much bigger impact. There were a few tracks that stood out more than the rest though, one particular one that stood out to me was when they first show the main characters of the series. There wasn't an OP, but that wasn't a problem. The ED however had a beautiful song with it. Again, I never wanted to skip it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nAt first, you could probably say that the characters were the stereotypical anime character cast. Shun: Cool headed leader. Satoru: Reckless, troublemaker. Maria: kind, main character's go-to friend. Mamoru: Whiny, scared kid. But soon enough, they all (well, most of them) develop into something else. I don't feel that the characters were static, especially not the main character: Saki. In most series, the main character usually isn't the favorite because of some flaws that show, but it wasn't the case for me in this series. As Saki developed, I liked her character more rather than less. Having the character development really shows how living in a community like that would affect them. I didn't have any complaints about the supporting cast either, they did their job as supporting characters.\\n\\n\r\nBy the end of the series, I felt like standing up and clapping. Again, I cannot give this series anything less than a 10/10. I would recommend this series to anyone who doesn't absolutely hate anime without a second thought. I suggest that you guys give Shin Sekai Yori a shot too.",

            "content": "What are humans? What are monsters? What do we really fear? What puts us above other forms of life? What makes us right and others wrong? To what extent should we defend humanity, or protect the fundamentals of our society? What should we do if one poses as a grave threat, but no crime has yet been committed? But what if the person is an innocent child and the threat is the extinction of humans? How should we judge indications that may lead to such a fate? Were humans even meant to possess such power?...\r\nThese are the kinds of questions asked in series such asMonster, Ergo Proxy, Texhnolyze Psycho-Pass, and several others. But none of these go as far this series. Shinsekai yori poses question after question after question constantly in nearly every episode.\\n\\n\r\nBut don't worry, it isn't something that is difficult to get through! This isn't one of those series that requires a PhD and intense concentration to fully understand. Shinsekai yori is easy to sit back and watch. Things are well explained, but there is still plenty of room for you to contemplate the ideas presented to you.\\n\\n\r\nThe title of this anime is shared with Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's 9th Symphony: \"From the New World,\" a recurring motif in the series. There is no \"OP\" in this series, but most episodes play the same song during the opening credits scenes. This makes for the perfect mood setting that fits the series. The artwork is very well done. The outdoor scenes are always beautiful. The lighting is perfect to fit the mood of every scene.\\n\\n\r\nThe story follows the life of the main character, Saki, from age 12 to 26. Saki's friends mentioned in the synopsis make up a delightful cast. All their personalities fit well with the overall mood and story. The characters, including some supporting characters, are very well developed and are easy to get attached to.\\n\\n\r\nSometimes the story can be quite brisk, but it is not difficult to keep up. For the most part, the series is very appropriately paced. This is one of those series that you have to wait until the very end for all your questions to be answered. Actually, it is quite surprising how early some secrets were revealed. But with that, many secrets were kept, and more and more questions were asked.\\n\\n\r\nThis is why MAL needs to allow a limited number of 11/10 ratings. Shiksekai yori instantly became my 2nd favorite anime series. I got watery eyes several times. But about 5 seconds after the final episode ended was the first time I cried watching anime.",

            "content": "Shinsekai Yori had a case of not knowing what precisely it wanted to be. It was an action show aimed at teenage boys, a political thriller for the older crowd and a philosophical drama for those who want to think. Except it failed to deliver on all of these promises. A significant amount of this is due to the poor characters, though the plot was decent for the most part.\r\nCharacters:  \r\nSaki, being the main character, severely disappoints with her constant passivity. She is rarely proactive which means that other characters always have to drive forward the plot. This includes Satoru, Shun, Kiroumaru and Squealer.She has very few defining character traits other than being very self-preserving and resilient. The only sequence where Saki drives the plot forward is when they are searching for someone, of which they do twice, and the sequences accomplish nothing other than provide us with nice scenery to look at. Her decision in episode 24 to burn the Psycho Buster in order to save Satoru from a chemical death is downright idiotic and illogical on every level. Not only does this keep the 'ogre' alive so it could potentially kill more people, but does nothing to save Satoru from her. Very fortunately for her, this pays off, but to make such a huge idiotic decision and not have the show comment on it one bit, aside from words of reassurance for Saki, which also makes no sense, detracts from her character immensely. If she were both self-preserving and logical she could have created a wall in front of Satoru whilst the 'ogre' suffered a chemical death, which would have ended the conflict immediately and saved Satoru's life. It is worth noting that Saki's character, although the story spanned almost 15 years of time, never changed or developed as a character. She stayed the same until the very end, where she was ruined. She also talks to the deceased Shun 10 years after he died to figure out plot details which would otherwise have been very difficult to know.\\n\\n\r\nSquealer and Kiroumaru stand out as characters in the wrong show because they are charismatic, intelligent, and honourable. Squealer progresses from a slimy servant to a glorious military leader rivalling Kiroumaru. Kiroumaru is the embodiment of honour, but it is revealed late in the series that he plotted a rebellion against the humans because they could have been destroyed by them at any moment. Squealer's motivations are very justifiable; fighting for the liberation of monster rats and equality of rats and humans. His experiences in the first arc of the series shape his strategy and actions in the 3rd arc where he declares war on the humans. Kiroumaru and Squealer stay true to their principles to the very end, and they do not waver in the face of death. Kiroumaru fights with the humans out of loyalty to them, even though his loyalty is not unconditional. Squealer fights for all rats in order to provide them with better lives. They are admirable characters, unlike everyone else in the show, who is either a redshirt or suffers from supreme stagnation. It is not difficult to see why these are characters are the best part of the show.\\n\\n\r\nEveryone else was mostly insignificant. We barely got any screentime of Shun, and so his purpose was to trigger an epiphany in Saki, however the memory wipe the episode after delays this for a very significant time, thus negating the consequences of his death for a few episodes. Mamoru and Maria were uninvolved with the plot to the point where their daughter, who has 0 lines that aren't screaming, is more relevant, more important, and drives the plot forward. Even she is not a character, though, she is a character-less enemy. Redshirts include Inui, Rijin, Kaburagi, the crazy monk dude, and countless other citizens. Tomiko is an interesting one because she does such evil things, like killing children and controlling every aspect of human life, out of fear that an apple with go bad and ruin everything. Her interests are in preservation of humans at the cost of freedom, progress, and humanity. This is contrasted well against Squealer, who is progressive and constantly advances his tribe even if it is highly dangerous for them all. Satoru is barely worth mentioning. When you see him in episode 5, that is his character and it never changes throughout the series. He makes rash decisions, and is still naive, especially during the hospital sequence where he doesn't want to realise what threat they are up against.\\n\\n\r\nPlot: \\n\r\nThe plot was the best thing about this show, though it wasn't anything better than 'good'. The first arc contains eough events, however, they are all placed at the end, leaving the first 4 episodes almost eventless. The first few episodes are used entirely to set the scene and infodump, rather than to develop the story. The introduction of the rat conflict and rat politics was a benefit, but having to watch humans play a large role in this detracted, especially since Satoru just killed everything. First arc has a decent conclusion, though in classic A1 fashion, there is unnecessary explanation to establish this conclusion. There are a lot of dropped plot elements, such as the characters who go missing who are given 1 sentence of information 10-15 episodes later.\\n\\n\r\nThe second arc is bad. Almost nothing happens. They go looking for people for at least 4 episodes. Episode 10 contained Shun's death and some infodumping, and provided conclusion to his part of the story, which wasn't much, albeit good, transitioning the show into the next segment. The infodumps during Shun's death episode provided enough information for his issue, but didn't particularly affect the main plot in any significant way. Then the plot convolutes and starts to introduce plot holes, such as memory wipes. Use of such memory wipes in addition to sealing of power would allow the Ethics Committee to solve basically every problem that arises with children, thus rendering cats unnecessary unless they become really bad. There's a once-off character whose role was to replace Shun but he had no relevance to anything and was forgotten immediately after. The Mamoru search showed some snowy scenery, but ultimately meant little. The Maria search showed the same scenery, and also added little apart from setting up the next arc and leaving Satoru and Saki on their own.\\n\\n\r\nThe third arc is better, but spends far too much time focusing on the humans who have not changed since the beginning, and nowhere near enough time on rat conflict and rat politics. There are a decent few episodes where Squealer is effectively likened to the Tywin Lannister of the show, and his battle strategy against the humans appears to be quite effective, but the actual damages are never shown or mentioned at all. The lack of shown consequences makes the attacks on human settlement feel insignificant when they shouldn't. The 'ogre' was a good introduction, but instead of utilising existing characters, a new one was created specifically for the role, and for the zero lines they say, they have more of an impact on the story than Shun, Mamoru and Maria combined. A seemingly unbeatable threat upped the stakes, which was good for tension, and it remained this way until they introduced the cop-out that is the Psycho Buster: a magic solution that will solve all of their problems. This undermines the abilities of the humans and instead of letting them fight and win on their own merits, acts as a way for the plot to grant an out the the losing faction. The Tokyo exploration episodes could have had good scenery, but it was just desert and caves, which was a missed opportunity. Yet again, Shinsekai Yori becomes a searching simulator as they look for the Psycho Plot Convenience. This isn't as bad as the previous searches, though, because it is their goal they are pursuing, not insignificant side characters that don't do anything useful. The intentional sabotage of the Psycho Buster by Saki when they could have won may have ruined Saki's character, but it served the plot by allowing the humans to come up with a solution of their own merits. The actual solution is given to Saki by Shun, who died 14 episodes prior, and even though is a figment of Saki's madness, reveals important details to Saki that she either should have known herself (thus strengthening her character) or should have figured out. Being told how to beat the 'ogre' reflected poorly on her character and the plot. Kiroumaru's sacrifice was well executed (pun intended) and served as a consequence for Saki's actions. \\n\\n\r\nThe final episode concluded on a low note. The bad guys won, oppression and tyranny would continue, freedom was crushed. But instead of being solemn, the show maintains a neutral stance. This neutrality does serve to let the viewers decide who they feel was righteous, but it was so obviously the rats, that this could almost be considered a negative point (it isn't, though). The decision of the human council to punish Squealer made sense, and his eventual release from torment was a good conclusion to his story, however, the show mostly ended off as it began; with an oppressive and tyrannical society that controls every aspect of human life. There is indication that the humans have undergone some cultural change regarding freedom of thought, but the rats are still considered subhuman and were all exterminated, save Kiroumaru's colony.\\n\\n\r\nSound and art/animation: \\n\r\nVoice acting was of standard quality, with standout performance by Squealer's VA. The OST was mostly forgettable, though not bad, with only one track being good. It set the scene on most occasions, but sometimes ruined the atmosphere, like during the confrontation with an imprisoned Squealer. Really not notable. It suffered from a lack of diversity in tracks and used the same ones over and over even if they didn't fit the mood of the scene.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style was a weird shoujo style, the scenery of some of the towns that were visited was nice, but the directing was inconsistent, especially camera angles that often focused on Saki's rear when it was inappropriate for the scene. Episodes 4 and 10 were directed very poorly, but the floating bars of soap in Shun's area were quite amusing to look at. Animation quality was inconsistent. Rarely it was high quality, usually was mediocre, often bad. Lighting was good most of the time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\r\nThis is a very messy show which has the misfortune of being created around intriguing ideas. That makes it more disappointing that this is bad.",

This time, the show happens to be Shinsekai Yori, or From the New World.\r\nBefore we begin. I must stress that this show is not for everyone. If you absolutely can't watch an anime with the following characteristics, you might not want to watch this show.\r\n*Spoilers\r\n1) No comic relief\r\n2) Slow-Paced in the narration of its story, with the only exception at a few high points of the story\r\n3) Homosexual theme, being relevant to the story (light shounen-ai and light shoujo-aionly happen in 1 episode)\\n\\n\r\nNow, let's begin.\\n\\n\r\n- - - Story - - -\\n\r\nWith minimal fan-service and without any comic relief, audiences are left with no choice but to take the show very seriously. In that sense, SY (Shinsekai Yori) does not disappoint. Overall, it has a fascinating and remarkably solid story line, one that examines the irregularities of human society in details, from various perspectives. Everything that occurs in earlier episodes happens in order to set up for the conclusion. \\n\r\nIt might be shocking to say this, for such a convoluted fantasy, psychological story, it has virtually no plot hole. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the slow-paced, no-comic-relief nature of SY might put a lot of people (including me) off. I am serious. There are points in this anime that I almost considered on dropping, but narrowly avoided that by a conviction to finish this anime. Fortunately, I was rewarded with a dramatic and immensely satisfying ending.\\n\r\n9/10 (not perfect score because of pacing)\\n\\n\r\n- - - Art - - -\\n\r\nCharacter design for main characters is decent, but there are severe distortion of characters' faces at different moments. The background is beautiful, but often repetitively used. The weakest link is the animation, which is average at best. \\n\r\n7.5/10\\n\\n\r\n- - - Sound - - -\\n\r\nThere is no OP in this anime, and there are 2 EDs for 25 eps. I don't mind the fact that there is no OP, and the EDs are enjoyable to listen to.\\n\r\nNevertheless, it must be mentioned that the soundtracks used, while appropriate, is endlessly repetitive. There were times when I wished that they would add more soundtracks, but in the end, they were adequate and appropriate for the story being told. \\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\n- - - Character - - -\\n\r\nWhile characters are praised for being \"realistic\", viewers can't really attach to them on an emotional level. Also, characters are not memorable either.\\n\r\nThat being said, a huge plus is that this anime tells different stories throughout main characters life from 12 to 26 years old. I was relieved when our main characters don't always \"stay a child\", as with most other anime. \\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\n- - - Enjoyment - - -\\n\r\nSlow-pacing, lack of comic relief, and not-the-best-characters on the negative side.\\n\r\nGreat story, fascinating social commentary, and extraordinary ending on the plus side.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\n- - - Overall - - -\\n\r\nI can understand why this anime is ranked so high on MAL.

            "content": "Shinsekai Yori is one of those unique works .\r\nIt is divided into 3 parts , childhood, adolescence and adulthood of the characters.\r\nShinsekai Yori tells us about the war , is like a history lesson. Teaches us about the innocence of when we are children , sexuality and its discovery in adolescence and the responsibility we have in adulthood. That human beings can be provided with a pure love beyond the barriers of time and life. But it may also be able to conduct such acts of perversity ...\r\nI think that one of the focus that makes Shinsekai Yori a masterpiece is the question: what makesus human? Why human when have so much power in his own hands only search for chaos? Why can we just love each other with that pure love just when we were only little childs? Why the world can be so cruel and beautiful at the same time? Why?\\n\\n\r\nIf you think about love, about life, about the world itself, go and watch it. \\n\\n\r\nThe only problem with this anime, is that there aren't any like this.",

            "content": "Caution: There will be spoilers.\r\nI began watching Shinsekai Yori because of the frequent urging of my friend. I dropped it at 3 episodes (because it failed to instill any sort of interest in me as to the outcome of the plot), then picked it up again a few months later because I saw it recommended by a fairly large amount of people who claimed that it was a \"classic\" and \"the best story ever\". I felt that I should at least watch the entire 25 episodes before passing judgement on what was seemingly a masterpiece. I did not make it. At 18/25 episodes, the serieshas so far failed to impress me with any sort of shocking revelation, and I would rather not waste a further 2 hours of my life to watch the rest. \\n\\n\r\nEdit: I have since watched the complete series.\\n\\n\r\nStory [5/10]\\n\\n\r\nAh, the story. Where to begin with this. The story was quite creative. A dystopian society set in the future with psychokinesis users and subhuman creatures. Cool.  However, I consider pacing to be vital to the enjoyment of the overall story, and boy I have a lot of shit to say about it. The pacing was, without a doubt, the most atrociously inconsistent I have encountered so far. I was sorely tempted numerous times to drop this anime at ep. 3, 11, and 16. \\n\\n\r\nThe first three minutes of the first episode were probably the highlight of my viewing experience. After that began an inconsistent downward spiral into mediocrity. There is a definite lack of subtlety in the way the anime presents the issues it wishes to discuss. It is forced at the viewer, as if the producers were trying to make us to feel a certain way. Terror, I suppose. Each emotion Saki experiences is overdramatic to the point of absurdity. Certain scenes are revealed, then seemingly discarded or forgotten, leaving the viewer to wonder about the point behind it, or whether it mattered at all. It seems that for each arc (I'm guessing one every timeskip), the protagonists seek the answer to the current arc's mystery:\\n\\n\r\nArc 1: Civilization\\n\r\nArc 2: Fiends/Cantus\\n\r\nArc 3: Queerats\\n\\n\r\nThis division would be perfectly fine if not for the way the answers were revealed. The arc drags its dead body slowly and painfully across the storyline for about 4-5 episodes before an all knowing person decides to bestow their wisdom upon them. Examples: false minoshiro, Shun, Head of Ethics, Squealer. It's done in such an obvious and convenient fashion that the few episodes before the end of an arc seem pointless. The producers' failure to create a decently cohesive adaptation of the manga makes the story seem like a dumb animal spasming erratically as it tries to reach the finish line. If you've ever tried to played Clop, this was what watching this anime felt like.\\n\\n\r\nA particular episode I had qualms with was ep. 8. No, it was not because of the homosexuality. I was fine with that. Saki x Maria forever. The problem was with the abrupt development of these relationships as well as the adults' obliviousness to these 14-year olds' overly sexual acts. Added to that was the fact that the anime didn't even attempt to explain it. \\n\\n\r\nAgain, I must point out the terrible pacing of the story. I'd venture that the episodes before the last arc were completely unbearable to watch. Sure, things were revealed, but they were revealed in such a vague and disconnected way that it honestly didn't matter until the final arc. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt [6/10]\\n\\n\r\nThe art was nice, with a few absolutely disgusting lapses here and there.\\n\\n\r\nSound [9/10]\\n\\n\r\nThe music was the one redeeming factor of this anime. It was the perfect tone for the solemn and tense mood that dominated the story. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter [3/10]\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were bland and uninteresting, with the exception of perhaps Shun and Squealer. The main character, Saki, was extremely hard to sympathize with. Her overreaction to everything was forced and off-putting. She had moments of revelation and even more moments of terrible stupidity (again, for the convenience of the plot, I suppose). The necessity of some characters other than plot devices is rather dubious.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Shinsekai Yori is an anime that tries too hard to be something that it's not. The political drama and philosophical issues it tries to bring up are embarassingly and painfully forced. It tries to juggle four different topics at once. Throughout the series, it's hard to tell what it actually wants to focus on. Is it the development of the current utopia? Is it Fiends/Karma Demons and the effects of Cantus? Is it the political factions between Queerats? Is it the weirdly depicted racism towards Queerats?\\n\\n\r\nI judged this anime quite harshly because in my mind, I'd already condemned it as an overrated series. Therefore, I would not recommend this anime to anyone coming in with high expectations.\\n",

            "content": "Shin Sekai Yori is the most tragic tale of wasted potential I have ever seen.\r\nThe setting is I think not only the most interesting setting in anime, but the most interesting idea.  It has taken one simple concept : 'people can change the world with their psychic powers', and done all sorts of things with it, from the effects it's had on society to balloon dogs to Tokyo.  \r\nIn the end, though, the setting serves as a backdrop.  It's somewhat relevant throughout the first half of the anime, and the parts where they learn about the setting are the best parts ofthe anime despite a heavy reliance on infodumps.  After all, it wouldn't have been easy to get the history of humanity across without infodumping.\\n\\n\r\nBut from there the story goes off in other directions, focusing on the theme of fantasy racism rather than any of the incredibly interesting questions that arise from the premise.  There are some twists, but fundamentally it tells a simple story which uses the fascinating setting's elements as plot devices but does not really explore them, and the 'terrifying villain' is no scarier and has no more impact than a simple 'monster too powerful for anyone to fight' would have in any other series.\\n\\n\r\nNone of these problems are helped by the frankly awful cast of characters.  Squealer is alright; he's interesting but his status as not-a-viewpoint-character limits how much of his depth can be shown, which would be fine if the rest of the characters held up.  But they don't.  Shun is competent.  Maria is sorta outgoing.  Mamoru is shy and weak-willed.  If other people hadn't made statements about them, I would not even be able to describe a single trait that either Saki or Satoru had; occasionally someone says that 'Saki is inquisitive' but that is hardly demonstrated in the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe art can be interesting sometimes but is very variable in quality.  One of the early episodes - I think episode 3, but I'm not sure - had a noticeable dip in overall art quality, and the character designs and art style in which the characters were drawn just weren't great overall.  The backgrounds were frequently good, though.\\n\\n\r\nThe first ending was awesome, the second was good.  I don't exactly recall the OST, but I remember liking it.  Music is one of the strong points of Shin Sekai Yori.",

            "content": "Shinsekai yori/From the New World 9/10\r\nWriting a review about this anime is a bit difficult for me, because I can't possible describe in words, what I felt watching this. I'm also afraid you won't understand what I'm talking about, you will have to watch this great anime yourself ;)\r\n1000 years from now in Japan. Every 'human' has mantra and can use telekinesis (imagining things and then make those things happen). For example they look at white paper and paint a motive without using paint, or break a bottle and then put the broken shards back together, without touching anything. It's all done with imagination -which is an important message during the whole anime - anything is possible if you can imagine it.\\n\\n\r\n(Spoilers ahead) \\n\r\nThe story involves 6 friends, (Saki, Satoru, Maria, Mamoru, Shun, Reiko) who were born and raised in a tranquil town, Kamisu's 66th district, they go to school together and are one group. We learn quickly that the school system is pretty cruel, all the weak and dangerous kids get killed, everyone in town (students, parents, teachers) know about it and find what they do is acceptable and necessary to protect their utopia world from collapsing. It kind of reminds us how our society works and treats outcasts. No one cares about the weak ones among us, and at the same time we are scared that somebody else could become stronger than us, and they could do us harm (terrorists). That's also an important theme in Shinsekai yori - FEAR.\\n\r\nSo we follow this 6 friends, watch them grow and experience all the pretty and all the dangerous things of life, we learn about creatures other than humans - queerats (we find out more about them as the story goes on), and why humans now can use telekinesis also called \"cursed power\" or the \"gods' power\".\\n\r\nLater what everyone is afraid of happens, one of this group's weakest gets killed by impure cats (humans don't kill humans, because it would cause them to die as well, death feedback), then another one becomes a Karmic Demon, a fiend, how the residents of district 66 call people, who lose control of their telekinesis power and kill everyone that is in sight. Those demons are exactly what humans are most scared of, so the \"government\" decided it would be best to kill the boy and erase everyones memories about him, also the remaining 4 friends can't seem to remember what his name was, what he looked like and so on, but they know something is very fishy about this situation and want to find out the truth, which brings them into more trouble. Now the government is after friend 4, Mamoru, and sends cats after him, but he's able to flee. The others of his group go look for him and find him. Maria decides to leave the town (that all of them started to hate) with the runaway, which later turned out to be a big mistake. Again many similarities happen between our world and theirs.\\n\r\nWe see a lot of time skips, things seem to happen rash, I wish they would take some more time to explain and explore, but everything makes sense in the end, so be patient. We get very attached to the characters, after seeing them grow up with those cruel rules, and how desperate they are, because they can't find another way to deal with their dangerous supernatural powers (they don't have enough knowledge, because so much is forbidden to talk about). Technically all of them could become Karmic Demons and erase humanity, that's why they 'the government/residents of the town' have to be careful and take care of the problem kids early on. And at the same time, it's such a cruel thing to do, simply killing your own children, because they could potentially become Karmic Demons, although they are still normal kids/average students, there's no mercy. \\n\r\nBig time skip - To be honest I don't want to explain what happens next, if I write more I will REALLY ruin the show for you guys. All I'm going to say is, shit gets real and the queerats history gets explained. Please give Shinsekai Yori a try, it's a show that demands all of your attention, you will be surprised by the twists, I enjoyed this much more then I expected!\\n\\n\r\nThe animation actually can be breath taking at times, but at other times the characters look like scribblings, it has a funny effect though and fits well in the story. There's no opening for this anime (I don' know if I have ever seen that before lol) but there are two different endings. The soundtracks we hear are mostly by an orchestra or a children's choir, that give you goosebumps like crazy! Again it fits perfectly to the story, no Japanese pop music to be expected here ;)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are...awesome and thankfully realistic. The girls kick ass, the parents aren't preaching, the boys make out with each other and that's perfectly normal, the government sucks, like in real life, and the queerats have balls! I was so happy that this anime didn't turn out to be one of those, that have a good plot, but terribly stereotypical acting characters! Like I said before there are a lot of time skips so the characters grow and change after every few episodes, but that is what's so awesome about this show. This could have gone really bad, rushing through important steps of life, but Shinsekai yori doesn't miss the important steps, no, everything you see matters, even those small things you wouldn't even dream of to be the slightest relevant, are relevant for the story, big props to the writer of the novel 'Shinsekai Yori' (in the U.S. also knowns as 'From the New World') that this anime was adapted from, Yusuke Kishi. Great message that makes you think about our society, and all the things, we could do better. It's pretty depressing actually...humans are cruel animals, but we can change. Yeah, that's my conclusion.",

            "content": "I watched Shinsekai Yori long, long ago. The reason I never really reviewed it is from the fear of being too biased towards the show since I instantly graded it 10 and labeled it my all-time favorite anime. You must be asking: \"But --- but, it's still graded 10 and still your all-time favorite anime! What's up with that?\" - now that I've re-watched the show, knowing the ending and all of the twists basically, I was able to catch a few to several inconsistencies in story, world, art, characters etc. - but did it really take away anything from the show? Not really. \r\nShinsekaiYori tells a story that spans over the fourteen years in total, with two time-shifts in its entirety. Both time-shifts occur after some meaningful events so to keep this review spoiler-less I'll try avoiding the talk about them. The story is told from the perspective of Saki, a young girl with friends and family like any other. It basically starts with their little group having a camping trip and learning something they should have not - as well for us to being exposed to acts of foreplay between two twelve year old kids. Oh well. In essence, if they had never learned what they did that day, they would have never really been caught up into story THAT much - we'd still have some conflicts which had affected the world, but the story this way is quite personal. \\n\\n\r\nSince the story in itself has numerous twists I cannot go into detail, so I'll try and go roundabout. In a sense it's a fantastical story but extremely realistic at the same time. It's put a thousand years into the future of today, with humans living seemingly peaceful lives full of love and care. The story consists of several twists and turns - some expected, others not as much - with some certain \"hey, what about that? That's not the way you said it was!\" moments. These moments, albeit rare, do somewhat take away from that episode - but not from the entire series. It is a story more turned towards mature than kid side, having several twists which are extremely thought-provoking all through to the end and beyond. It starts as extremely slow-paced establishment and basically nothing happens until episode 10 or so - only world building. For some, like me, who really appreciate world building this has come as a breath of fresh air. Before the story essentially kicks off, you're pretty much familiar with world - its origin and its present, which helps a lot when trying to accumulate thoughts as to why certain things are happening. Extremely well done and crafted story - that's all I've got to say.  \\n\\n\r\nThe first thing you'll most-likely notice is imaginative art. While it may not be spectacular and ever-evolving, it is certainly different. It's extremely well done and oftentimes it shifts as the mood of the scene changes - gradient hues take over, coloring the world green/purple or any other dimming color. It has it's bright moments of course, but most of the major events occur in dark spaces. Another thing I must praise this show for are the backgrounds - they are absolutely breathtaking. I'd take a bet that in each episode you can extract at least 4-5 beautiful, completely different wallpapers for your desktop. While animation may be lacking sometimes, some scenes are extremely well done (like Saki falling through the sky, or Saki and Satoru running through the tunnels etc.) and worth a praise. Characters are all unique when it comes to art department, each having its own distinguishing trait but also quite some symbolism in the very character department - Saki, throughout the entire series, remains as one character (out of main ones, to be precise) who is most-likely to be present in real life. For instance Maria has extremely long, red hair and blue eyes, Shun and Satoru have hard-to-make hairstyles as well as that kid no one really remembers. In that sense it helps us to relate to Saki from whose perspective this story is told. \\n\r\nOn the other side of production team we have sound. I've got to say - if the soundtrack of \"The Fountain\" is my all-time favorite movie OST, this Shinsekai Yori wins in anime department. \"Kage no Denshouka Dainibu\" to list one of many is simply shiver-worth soundtrack which befits each scene it's placed into. It's quite grappling and, even when listened outside the context of series, is extremely beautiful - to an extent where I'd put it among my favorite themes ever (probably just after \"Death is the Road to Awe\" from Clint Mansel). Voice actors (and actresses) put up an virtuous effort in delivering their characters. I especially must give credit to Namikawa Daisuke, a man who gave a voice to the character of Squealer - probably the most amazing performance among amazing performances. So yeah ... production ... much wow. \\n\\n\r\nNow we come to the character department. It's really hard to label these characters - not because they're not developed or anything but because they're just simply ... humans. All of them (oops). They all deal with certain issues in their own ways, each tackling a certain problem the best way they see fit. That's what makes each of them unique and fun to observe and even relate to. For instance, Saki has qualms about dealing with at-the-moment perilous situation, but she has easier way of moving on. Satoru on the other hand handles the present situation which requires quick answer easily but has a harder time of moving on. And so on and so forth. All these things make each character you see in the series developed and ... relate-able. Regardless of whether you like them or not, when their story comes to fruit, you can feel for them all the same. That's one of the greatest strengths of Shinsekai Yori - characters are not badass stereotypes who go round spouting badass one-liners. They're all humans - they can act though, but that's all there is to it - an act. \\n\\n\r\nThis has been my longest review since ... well, ever. The reason being is that I tried to deliver Shinsekai Yori to those who hadn't watched it the best way possible without spoiling anything - which is actually extremely difficult. All the juice of Shinsekai Yori lies in the spoilers. But oh well. I managed to slip one or two in there. I'm a monster. \\n\\n\r\nI quickly understood that Shinsekai Yori won't be for everyone. Aside from two frame yaoi and yuri moments we have in the 8th episode (man did a lot of people drop the show because of it. Why? Beats me.), Shinsekai Yori starts extremely slowly. And the pace never really goes over-the-top-full-of-action. It always takes its time to establish things and characters, without simply rushing head-on to the conclusion (well, aside from first 4 minutes of last episode ... BADASS MOMENT!) . At times it has weird art-style and the story is simply sometimes hard to follow. It's quite thought-provoking and I can see why some people would simply get bored of it. All I'm asking of you is to give it a chance. Watch an episode per day if you find it boring and if you keep tackling the issues the show is, I promise you you'll have a great time.\\n\\n\r\nNow, do I recommend Shinsekai Yori? Well ... isn't that kind of obvious? I do. I may still seem biased (probably because I am?) but that does not take away anything from the show - if anything, it should help you decide whether to pick it up or not. Pick it up. It actually just might surprise you.",

            "content": "We often see anime adapted from manga, but we rarely see an anime adapted from a young adult novel. This much lauded anime is adapted from a Japanese young adult novel, that itself is basically an adaptation/remake of 2 classic dystopian novels from the early 20th century. Shinsekai Yori translates as \"From the New World\", which is appropriate since it borrows heavily from both the novel \" Brave New World\" by Aldous Huxley and especially from a lesser known 1924 novel called \"We\" by Yevgeny Zamyatin. Shinsekai also seems to take some inspiration from Harry Potter with one of the major conflicts being between wizardsupremacists and non-magic users, whom I will simply call \"muggles\" for the rest of this review.\\n\\n\r\nWARNING! THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS! \\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nIn the year 2011, ex-Soviet mad scientists in Azerbaijan created a mutagen turning humans into magic users. The mutagen spread until 0.5 percent of the population were wizards. The wizards then wiped out 99% of the muggles in a few years and formed brutal dictatorships with the most powerful wizards serving as dictators. The muggles were forced to be slaves of course. For the first 600 years there were 19 Wizard dictatorships with muggle slaves that lived under an uneasy truce. There were also a few groups of muggle hunter gatherers, and small groups of wizard scientists, who built the last biotic computers since nearly all books had been destroyed. Japan alone contained 4 of the Wizard empires because Japanese wizards were rather quarrelsome. A problem arose when the Cherry Blossum Empire\u2019s last ruler was a complete madman who killed half its population. In order to create order and peace, Japanese Wizard scientists through brain washing and genetic engineering were able to make it so killing another human resulted in your own death. However, this meant wizards couldn\u2019t kill muggles either. To correct this and put down the muggles once and for all, the surviving muggles were rounded up and mutated into mole-men with inferior intelligence and a different enough genetic code that wizards could still kill them. The mole-men then became the new slaves of the more peaceful wizard societies. However, some mole-men continued to foster dreams of rebellion. Any humans born to Wizard families that don\u2019t have magic powers (Squibs) are sacrificed in the tradition of ancient Sparta, only with giant cat monsters instead of leaving the infants out to die. Those who cheat at mandatory wizard school are also killed by the Government\u2019s cat monsters. In addition to heavy brainwashing, the Wizard police state in which our characters live is able to pacify the population by promoting LOTS of casual sex both heterosexual and homosexual. \\n\\n\r\nThe mechanism that kills Wizards who commit murder, works by hypnosis shutting down the murderer\u2019s liver once the murderer is aware they killed someone (hypnosis can\u2019t actually do that BTW) and this causes high potassium levels (liver failure actually causes LOW potassium levels) and the high K levels cause a heart attack. However, there are 2 types of mutants that can still kill people. The first are \u201cfiends\u201d who can slaughter people without suffering death feedback. The second are \u201cKarma Demons\u201d who can\u2019t control their powers and kill people unintentionally and thusly avoid triggering the hypnosis. The reason the government kills anyone not in full control of their magic, or who cheats, or who doesn't develop magic early enough, is presumably to prevent \u201cfiends\u201d and Karma Demons\u201d from appearing. In the current year of 3,000 AD, there is a global population of 70 million wizards and an unknown number of Mole-men, but we know not nearly as many as wizards. Wizard communities are surrounded by powerful barriers that citizens believe were built to keep them safe, but were actually built to keep them in, and stop their magic from warping the environment any more than it already has.\\n\\n\r\nPretty impressive background world huh? A true masterpiece! Here is why I was less impressed than most of my fellow MAL users. I read obscure classic novels that aren't on the summer reading list...because I'm a nerd. Let's look at the similarities with \"We\". \\n\r\n1. dystopian Police State taking place exactly 1,000 years in the future. 2. Government rules though brain washing, genetic engineering, and brutal force used by secret police at the behest of a shady government council. 3. LOTS of casual sex both heterosexual and homosexual is encouraged to keep citizens passive. 4. A wall is built around the nation that people think is protecting them, but is actually keeping them in. 5. Anyone who dissents and is not executed has their memories wiped. 6. Outside the wall are hairy \"beast men\" that are the mutant descendants of those not conquered by the Police State. 7. The hairy beast men lead a revolt against the government and do major damage to it. 8. The novel ends open ended with some optimism towards a better future. \\n\\n\r\nThe line between homage and complete ripoff is thin. However, if a great story is forgotten and young readers refuse to give it a chance, is it a sin to make a reboot that better captures the hearts of young readers? I actually don't think so. That is most of the reason I rated Shinsekai as highly as I did. Now that background is out of the way, we will proceed to look at the actual plot itself.\\n\\n\r\nWe follow a group of 5 young magic users who must uncover the brutal secrets of their society and unearth the brutal history that led them to this point. At the same time they must go to Wizard school and perfect their magic...or else. The major conflict occurs when a highly charismatic yet extremely treacherous member of the mole-men attempts to raise an army to wipe out the wizards and become the dominant species on Earth. His name is \"Squeaker\", but I will refer to him as Mole-neto. We the audience learn more about the society in each episode, but unfortunately our heroes keep getting their memories erased by the wizard government, so we have to hear things repeated again and again! However, the wizard government doesn't want to kill our leading lady Saki, because she has amazing leadership skills and has been handpicked to be the next ruler of the most powerful organization of the Wizard Police State called the Ethics Committee, who are basically like the Wizard KGB. Eventually Mole-neto is defeated and our MC ends the show wishing to gradually make her society suck less!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nWe have 5 main characters, but unfortunately most of them aren't very interesting or well developed. The character that gets the VAST majority of the character building and development is Saki Watanabe, our MC girl. Saki is a brilliant strategist, intelligent, kindhearted, yet logical and highly pragmatic. She is sort of like if you combined Inspector Akane from Psychopass with Legolas from LOTR. Her only flaw is that she doesn't have any god damn flaws! William Faulkner wrote that only flawed characters in deep conflict with themselves are worth reading about. It is true that when we think of the greatest characters of all time we're thinking: Hamlet, Raskolnikov, Pierre Bezukhov, not fucking Full Paragon Commander Shepard! I was even beginning to read her subtitles in Shepard's voice by the end! The anime gives at least a little effort trying to generate sympathy for Mole-neto, but he quickly undermines that by being a complete asshole with no redeeming qualities. He isn't generous to his own people, he doesn't have a code of honor, he doesn't have ANY of the anti-hero traits that made other villains like his namesake Magneto interesting. He's a fucking asshole! My favorite character BY FAR is Kiroumaru the Samurai Mole! He's a mole-man, who is also a samurai! That's fucking awesome! He also is honorable to a fault, and has disdain for humans, yet knows that the mole-men must co-exist with the wizards if they are to survive. He doesn't get NEARLY enough screen time!\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe only really good music in this anime is Dvorak's \"New World Symphony\" (ya get it?)\" which it plays the same short segment of...over....and over...and over. The best use was in the opening scene depicting the outbreak of the Wizard/Muggle war. A wizard kid with an ascot like Fred in Scooby Doo is splattering muggles to the calming sounds of Dvorak, creating unintentional hilarity! I'm not sure if it is how unfitting the music is, or the fact that you just CAN'T look threatening wearing an ascot!\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is pretty damn good. It isn't Mushishi good or anything, but it is well above average.\\n\\n\\n\r\nBonus Section: Plot Holes! Oh dear God the plot holes!\\n\\n\r\nThe anime spends a LOT of time trying to convince the viewer to have some sympathy for the utilitarian principals of the dystopian government, but much of their killing is actually pointless. They have Wizards that can seal off the power of any wizard and the seal can only be broken if someone else recites that wizard's personal incantation. The Wizard government are MASTERS of erasing memories as we learn over and over. Why not seal the problem child's powers, then erase problem child's special incantation from the minds of any close relatives or friends that happen to know it? Nope! Cat monsters! The novel may actually explain why this wouldn't work, but the anime leaves us with the impression that the Wizard government honestly never thought of it and are just a bunch of complete idiots! Our heroes get their powers sealed, but the government allows them to recite each other's mantras and restore each other's powers, even though this is supposed to be highly illegal. Hell, it even results in a character becoming a Karma Demon and destroying an entire city! Yet the government couldn't give less of a fuck! They just MIB everyone's memory for the upteenth time! You would think with all the genetic engineering and brainwashing they would have created an instant death trigger for someone who without authority reactivates a wizard's power that has been sealed by the police! Nope! They just have insta-death triggers for nearly every other illegal activity. Here is another HUGE problem with the plot. The Wizards won their war with the Muggles WAY too easily. It is clearly stated that the first wizards during the war didn't have training from wizard schools and magic had evolved to be FAR more powerful by the year 3,000. This is a problem because Satoru is an A class wizard from the year 3,000 AD, who has been training his entire life, yet gets tired fighting hoards of mole-men using primitive bows and arrows! Yet the vastly weaker and untrained wizards of the past shit stomped muggle armies with tanks, machine guns, and jet fighters and were able to each rack up a 200-1 kill ratio. It also turns out for some poorly explained reason that magic is much more effective as an offensive than defensive weapon. Even an S class wizard/Ninja gets killed easily by fucking Mole-men when he has to go on defense. You can't win outnumbered 200 to 1 with no defense! The muggles would have taken that war with sheer attrition. It isn't like the wizards had H-bomb level attacks! Even the most powerful wizards from 3,000 AD couldn't do that!\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nShinsekai Yori wasn't the perfect series that so many MAL critics seem to think it is. However, it was a pretty solid series and a decent adaptation of old dystopian novels that this generation might actually enjoy...unlike Brave New World which literally every student HATES having to read in school. Were the characters great? Not really. Did the series have a lot of plot holes? Yes it did. However, Shinsekai also made young viewers have to think about government abuse of power, utilitarianism and security vs. humanism and freedom, the dangers of nationalism and discrimination, and how far one should go to protect your own freedom against tyranny. Is Shinsekai as good as \"We\" ? FUCK no it isn't! However, if you  have a little brat that won't eat his healthy vegetables and only wants to eat ice cream and Hershey's bars, wouldn't you settle for seeing him eat yogurt with a bit of fruit? It isn't broccoli, but it is a HUGE improvement over Hershey's and ice cream. For being at least a decent, modern adaptation of something legitimately great, Shinsekai does deserve some praise!  \\n",

            "content": "Humans always dreamed. We dream all the time. We have dreams we all want to fulfill. Thanks to our imagination, those dreams can be endless. Everybody has imagination and anybody can have any kind of thoughts at any time. But what can happen if what we imagine, even what we dream (awake or sleep), at least just a piece of it, can become real? Great? Just remember than some people have nightmares, some people are evil, and some others are completely rotten.\r\nShinsekai Yori really gives credits to its title, a fantasy new world in Japan 1000, years ahead in the future, where people have Cantus:A complex kind of telekinesis, like an extension of the body for those who use it. But we will see that Cantus is much more than that.\\n\\n\r\nShinsekai Yori will show us a beatiful but complex world, filled with weird but interesting creatures, societies that hide lots and lots of secrets, and the story of Saki and her group of friends and how they are dragged to figure out what's is behind all the darkness and mysteries. An outstanding tale where the years go and go, and we will get to see how much each character change and get stronger or weaker. We will see how much Saki grows up and start to face her fears.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime doesn't care of genres or beliefs: with a precious style of animation, a fluid motion, watching all the exciting plot twist this anime has to offer, and a gem of soundtrack, Shinsekai Yori can break any expectation. You will see beatiful settings; both endings will let you feel all the story going throught your thoughts and your body and the final episodes will let you with a sensation of \"Damn!\".\\n\\n\r\nBecause nothing is perfect, it has some flaws: A slow begining where you can feel a bit bored, and some few episodes just in the middle of the story where you can feel that again; but the story will always snowball out of control, hit you in the face, and you will feel it hard. Each arc is really interesting and will end with a surprise.\\n\\n\r\nMy conclusion: Shinsekai Yori is a master piece of anime. It is the anime that nobody knows about but everybody should watch. I really want more people to watch it and appreciate it as much as I do.",

            "content": "Where to begin... First of all, I saw this from someone else's recommendation and I got to say: anyone who did not watch this anime definitely should. This anime is one of the few that affected me in real life (another one is Psycho-pass). I chose Shinsekai yori as my first anime review because that is simply how good this anime is. It isn't mainstream and action packed with blazing fights. This anime is on a whole different level than most of the other ones I watched and its unorthodox elements captivated and drew me in the anime even more. It makes you do alot of thinking and can change what your beliefs are if it is that influential. Once you have seen it, you can't brush it off as another anime that you've watched. It will stick with you and you will ponder about it for a long time. (Some spoilers, but not too much)\\n\\n\r\nThe beginning of the anime started out as creepy and dark, but it did well to build up the suspense and the story later on. It might be a little confusing to understand the plot and the setting of the story but after a few episodes you understand when the story is taking place, how the people get there, and what they are talking about. The story is filled with elements of an utopia, dystopia, murder, adventure, ESP, horror, romance, and others. However, the things that struck me most were the horror parts of the story. The thriller suspense made me shiver and cold sweats were beading down my face. It also made me want to skip some parts of the episodes. \\n\\n\r\nThe story has some time slips with the focus on the protagonist, Saki, and with her, we can see the growth of a child and how she grew up from this world that is beginning to seem twisted in her mind. We can see the influence of the world it has on Saki and her group of friends, as they all begin to change and develop into significant characters. Saki, above all, is the greatest protagonist as you see her growth into an adult and mature mindset. You would assume that this is a world with only humans but you later realize that there is another sentient foreign species that revere the humans as gods. It is also quite interesting that this story introduces the policies and treatment of foreign species, and we can easily reflect that to real life events. As a result, this anime isn't simply superficial but the author of the novel tried to incorporate aspects of the real world to the anime.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the art was great, the story fantastic, the music adding to the suspense and thriller, the characters were outstanding (even the nonhumans), and I really, really enjoyed it. 10/10.\\n\r\nHope you had fun reading my first review and ultimately see this amazing anime. Shinsekai yori FTW.",

            "content": "Tens, tens all across the boards, I was quite excited to see this anime especially with its popularity on MAL and its popularity in the reviews, aside from this review that I am currently writing, all of them consisted of a positive review. I was impressed, not even one person gave Shinsekai Yori a low score...I guess that I am going to have to be that person. \r\nShinsekai Yori is an anime adapted from its novel counterpart that released in 2012, after seeing its positive praise I decided to pick it up, so here are my thoughts on the anime. \r\nStory \r\nIf you're reading thisand you've also read the synopsis here my suggestion is to read this or on some wiki because the synopsis IS NO WHERE NEAR THE ACTUAL PLOT, I am serious. From reading it you'd assume it's probably some mystery  or something at least I did but nope the anime is doesn't revolve around that 'rumour' that is mentioned. \\n\r\nShinsekai Yori is set 1000 years into the future where humans have developed psychic abilities known as cantus. Due to this nature society has evolved and would seem perfect at least so it seems but of course there is more than meets the eye.  The anime then progresses over the lives of our characters and explore many themes that surround it. Its execution is more arc based as the story progresses in small plot elements that will later progress throughout the show. While I don't think is not a bad idea the general execution is well tiresome. Shinsekai Yori is a heavy exposition anime it requires a lot of attention to every detail so it may not exactly be your cup tea if you're not into heavy talking and while you're reading this thinking that I am incompetent to fully engage, I really did try with this anime. I wanted to love it but it was incredibly difficult. One of the problems was essentially the plot points in the show, a lot of them and I mean a lot are only brought up due to convenience when instead these plot points should've been brought up often. Another reason why I couldn't fully enjoy the story is because it develops on arcs where I just wasn't fully interested mainly because some arcs tend to fall astray from the main synopsis of the show or into characters which I never fully cared for. While the anime does explore themes it's only really the tip of the iceberg for example the ever so popular topic of same-sex relationships is explored and what I mean is essentially that people are just gay. The relationships or the themes is not deepening or explored fully it just happens, not that it's entirely a problem but with people praising it's use of theme-ing I couldn't really see it because what Shinsekai Yori is showing me makes it no different from any other relationship.  Also more personally but the plot twists to me in this show were incredibly predictable. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters \\n\r\nIn terms of characters not many of them are interesting to begin with. The story revolves around a group of characters with Saki Watanabe being the main character, one of the major problems I had with her is essentially how much praise she got...for being normal. Everyone and I mean everyone in the show comments on how much potential she has or how amazing she is but all she does is just stands there, there are times where she is somewhat useful but she doesn't do many things interesting. The rest of the characters aren't exactly gold either, most of them don't hold much interest or exactly deepen the plot. There's very little care for characters in the show not until the later parts of the show but it's only briefly, it's quite the shame because with Shinsekai Yori deepening towards its society you could do some good character building but unfortunately the characters are just there, you could replace the characters with anyone and it wouldn't impact the show in the slightest. \\n\\n\r\nPresentation\\n\r\nThe art style is pretty good except for one design of characters that I don't particularly like, that being the queerats. They can die but the rest of the animation and art is pretty good to look at, I didn't mind it. The soundtrack of the anime is pretty good, I quite liked it one of the few anime osts that I have indeed noticed and thought it was pretty good and despite this anime not having an opening the ending theme for it is pretty awesome. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion \\n\r\nPersonally Shinsekai Yori is an overrated anime to me. Its plot is all over the place and is pretentious by attempting to explore many themes present in our society today but it's not a good attempt to me especially with its bland characters. Maybe there's just something wrong with me because a lot of people love this anime but personally I just couldn't enjoy it which leaves me with my final rating of this anime being 6. \\n",

            "content": "Shinsekai Yori (From the New World in English) was recommended to me with the words \"Psychic pansexuals in a dystopian future with rat people and good music and you will cry,\" which ended up describing the series far better than I thought it would. This anime was definitely one that pulled me in from the get-go, and kept me interested the whole way through.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThough this show starts off with a vague beginning, things don't take long to pick up and get good. This story centers around five characters and spans many years, so we get to see the characters grow from mere children toindependent adults.\\n\r\nShinsekai Yori features an interesting tale of people who have psychic powers as well as the strange rat people that worship them as gods. Though this show takes place in Japan, the worldbuilding is astounding. This takes place far in the future, yet we get to see exactly how we ended up in this isolated country where utopian/dystopian governments reign. We also get to see the organization of the simpler-minded monster rats (I watched the dub, so I know them as monster rats, but in the Japanese they're called queerats). Though they lead a simple life, the inner workings of their government system impressed me. They're not quite as dumb as the characters think they are.\\n\r\nThis show heads along at a fair pace: not too fast and not too slow. It also feels as if it's holding its breath for something larger to happen later on (and happen it does, but I'll avoid talking about it because of spoilers).\\n\r\nOne of the things this show really excelled in was the foreshadowing. Early on, it gives you all the keys you need to unlock the plot twists coming later, yet you never notice it until it happens. This show takes on the nature of a self-fulfilling prophecy in a way. It's definitely worth a rewatch (though I haven't rewatched it myself yet), just to see exactly how well the show foretold its own ending.\\n\r\nAnother really amazing thing about the show was the suspense factor. This show creates a really interesting atmosphere that draws you into the story and characters, to the point where you almost feel like you're there with them. One especially notable suspense part was when two characters are hiding from something unknown. At this point, all music stops and it goes completely silent, where all the characters can do is simply hold their breath. I found myself holding my breath too, and staring wide-eyed at the screen until the moment passed.\\n\r\nAt the end, the show finally releases the suspense it's been holding you in since the beginning and throws out a plot twist that makes the rest of the story pieces suddenly click into place. Once it's revealed, you wonder how you didn't think of this before, since as I said, it was foreshadowed right from the start.\\n\r\nThere were some negative aspects of the story, though. It's not perfect by any means, but it's still really darn good. \\n\r\nOne of the main things that bothered me was sometimes the show would create suspense for things but not really capitalize on them, or resolve them in a completely different way than what they seemed to be doing.\\n\r\nFor example, there was the dystopian government, which I guess didn't really turn out to be dystopian at all. There was talk of punishment, but that didn't really ever happen in a definitive way. There was also one part which made me say \"Oh shit\" out loud, but didn't end up resulting in anything.\\n\r\nIn addition to that, the show has an infodump at one point that didn't result in what they hinted it would, but it was a creatively done infodump, so I'll let it slide.\\n\r\nI felt like the problems were caused by the show getting too involved in other things to properly resolve some confusion in the beginning, but the positives of the story overwhelmingly outshine the negatives.\\n\\n\r\nShinsekai Yori definitely has a subtle note about the darker side of humanity, and is a fairly simple, linear tale about five kids learning the truth of their world. And one by one, they start to disappear.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nThis show was airing at around the same time as Sword Art Online, another A-1 production, so it missed out on the spotlight and the budget for the most part. The characters lack shading and the eyes are mostly one color, so it may take some time to get used to the flat-color look. In terms of animation, it's above average but not anything spectacular. However, it gets a 7 rather than a 6 because some of the scenery shots were simply gorgeous. A couple that stood out to me were a sky full of stars in one of the early episodes and a sunset backdrop in the second ED, but there were a lot of good background pictures. Sometimes the backgrounds looked a little sloppy and too obviously hastily painted in, but for the most part they were very colorful and detailed.\\n\r\nI also liked the look of the monster rats, who were grotesque creatures with bulging eyes and clawed hands. Even though they weren't pretty to look at, I have to give the show props for creating these ugly creatures because they do look a lot like mutated naked mole rats, the creatures they're based off of.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nAn interesting thing about Shinsekai Yori is that it doesn't have an opening. The show simply jumps right into the episode and places the opening credits alongside the action. It may be weird to get used to, but I think it suits this anime since I can't really imagine it with a peppy J-rock number as per the norm.\\n\r\nThis show does have ending songs though, both of which were good but not legendary.\\n\r\nThe OST of this show was good. It wasn't anything super amazing or unique, but in terms of using it effectively, the show rose above and beyond. They also knew when less is more, stopping the music at key parts to let the scene carry itself. \\n\r\nThis OST doesn't demand to be noticed. It's there and compliments the scene from behind, adding to the mood and effect without overshadowing the other aspects.\\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, I watched the dub of this show. This show was dubbed by ADV, and I have a strong dislike for ADV dubs in general, since they range from mediocre to just plain bad (other ADV dubs include Angel Beats, No. 6, and Penguindrum). For this show, I thought the voice acting in general was good and improved later, but I was not a fan of some of the casting choices (though I don't think ADV has a huge range of voice actors to pick anyway, which is why they end up reusing so many).\\n\r\nI think the standout dub voice for me is Squealer, the ambiguous monster rat that keeps appearing throughout the story. He has a nasal, unpleasant-sounding voice that I think perfectly suits the character. It may not be the nicest on the ears, but it's definitely a realistic voice (in my opinion) for this type of creature.\\n\r\nI haven't seen any of the original Japanese of this show, but I'm sure it's better than the dub. I'd recommend watching this show subbed, unless you really, really want to watch it dubbed.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\r\nThe story revolves around five kids who grow into adults. These five kids all have their own personalities and are interesting in their own ways, but we don't really get to see much of what happened to them before the show started. I would have liked to see a little more of their childhood, since it seems like they've known each other for a while.\\n\r\nThere's also the pansexuals aspect, which I didn't have a problem with, though some people may be turned off by it (There's a reason for that, I promise. It doesn't turn into a yaoi/yuri anime and it's not shown in a fetishized way). In the beginning, there's some hinted (boy/girl) relationships between characters, but nothing for certain. Then there's a timeskip, and we suddenly see a lot of boy/boy and girl/girl. That was a rather sudden change for me, but as I said it has a specific reason.\\n\r\nThe reason the characters category is getting an 8 out of 10 rather than a 9 is because there wasn't much character development, aside from the main character Saki. She grew and changed a lot during the show, while her four friends were rather sidelined until important things happened to them. Overall though, the characters were very well done and I really enjoyed seeing the growth Saki and her friends underwent.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nMy enjoyment score is partially based on how quickly I watch a show, and I think I broke some kind of record with this one. The first day I watched the first 14 episodes, and watched the remaining 11 the day after. The show was so addictive that I wanted to know more and more, and before I knew it I was halfway through.\\n\r\nBesides how quickly I watched it, I thoroughly enjoyed the simple, linear, yet unique story, the effective background music, and the genius use of foreshadowing. This was definitely one that captured my interest the whole way through and did not get boring at all.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nAs I said, some things that the show fell flat on, but by and large an interesting and unique tale about where humanity would go if given a certain power. I definitely recommend watching/rewatching this show, since I loved it, and I think most people will too.\\n\\n\r\nI've said enough now. It's time for you to watch an anime about psychic pansexuals in a dystopian future with rat people and good music and crying.",

            "content": "let's see. to be completely honest, i was very disappointed in this. although in this animes defense i went into watching it expecting to see something that this anime is not.\r\na friend recommended this anime to me a while back, and the only thing he told me about it was \"its about telekinetics\" witch i absolutely love. i adore telekinesis in just about anything, especially anime. now, that is probably why i didn't enjoy this anime as much as other people. i went into it expecting to see what i wanted to see instead of watching the anime for what it is. what made mewatch the series in the first place was the first episode. as a mater of fact. the first few minutes of the first episode entranced me. it was perfect to say the least. the visuals, the sound, everything about those first few minutes caught my attention, sadly though, that same intro ruined this anime. that intro set my expectations pretty high, making the rest of Shinsekai yori a huge disappointment.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5/10\\n\r\nin many review of this anime people usually put 10/10 or 9/10 etc... but i just don't see it. like i was talking about the intro set a standard the rest of the anime failed to reach. in the first episode of shinsekai yori, it stars off with very mellow dramatic music and a boy. in the intro this boy is going around the neighborhood absolutely wrecking the place using his TK (telekinesis) killing people left and right, kicking the army's ass without a care in the world. so i assume the rest of this anime will be about TK users VS the world. WRONG! this anime is about TK users VS giant mutant cats and giant mutated naked mole rats. thats right, the main antagonistic force throughout the entirety of this anime, are a bunch of over sized talking giant naked mole rats. i found this, to say the least, horribly disappointing to the point where it was almost laughable. now, this aside, the over all story in itself is pretty \"meh\" it is hard to descripe without giving away spoilers. so for now the only way i could possibly describe the story of this anime is \"meh\"  \\n\\n\r\nart: 9/10 \\n\r\nthe art style used in this anime is pretty interesting. they use a mix of very subtle gradients and an interesting blend of color. although there is one odd episode where the art changes to a more \"cashern sins\" style and then goes back to normal in the next episode.\\n\\n\r\nsound: 9/10 \\n\r\nthe soundtrack used in this anime caught me off guard. in a good way. although there is no one track i feel like listening to outside of the anime itself. the music used flowed flawlessly with what was going on in the anime and enveloped you into the universe itself.\\n\\n\r\ncharacter: 8/10\\n\r\ncharacters in this anime are all very unique in their own way. each character has a defining personality, using a similar structure as any other anime but with enough originality that they become their own. there is a slight lack in character development and on occasion some characters will just vanish (pun :D)\\n\\n\r\nenjoyment: 5/10\\n\r\nlike i have said. the first episode set a standard the rest of this anime never met. i watched each episode hoping that maybe one of them will have the same feel as the intro did. sadly i finished the anime without once seeing the episode i had been weighting for. i was left disappointed, on top of that the paramount ending made me more upset with this series. \\n\\n\r\noverall: 5/10\\n\r\nalthough every other aspect of this anime was brilliant, i felt the plot fell short after the first 2 minutes of the first episode and left me horribly disappointed. i would only recommend this to people who enjoy watching people who have TK waste it away snow boarding, boating and fighting giant naked mole rats.",

            "content": "Shinsekai Yori squanders its promising premise with an abundance of tiresome exposition, cardboard characters, and a lethargic story line.\r\nFrom the New World is a show that should be something so much more as the foundations of its premise should lead to a captivating and interesting story.  However, towards the middle of the first arc the issues with this anime became very apparent.\r\nFirst of all, most of the story follows Saki and her friends as their quest for curiosity leads to them discovering the intentionally hidden mysteries of their world.  However, the show never devotes any time to learn much about Saki or mostof her group.  We don\u2019t know anything about Saki\u2019s interests, passions, or even what drives her to take an interest in the world around her.  Most of the time she feels very one dimensional and standard in nature.  This is also problematic because her stubborn and ungracious personality frequently turns a blind eye to the consequences of her actions.  Some of the time these ramifications even lead to her losing her friends and coping with life threatening situations, but when dealing with these repercussions she seems weirdly spoiled or as if she never expected to have to cope with any consequences at all.  The side cast is also very weak and standard in nature.  We know nothing about their families, interests, hobbies, or why they continue to follow Saki into danger.  There is almost no time devoted to their development as for most of the show the character\u2019s personalities never change or grow.  At times they seem to clash with each other so often it left me pondering why they are even friends to begin with.  Most of the times when dealing with the fallout of following Saki they seem awkwardly nonchalant.  Satoru blindly follows Saki even though they fall out with each other multiple times throughout the show.  Maria is simply Saki\u2019s friend and nothing more.  Mamoru is a one note character who's only trait is shyness, and most of the villagers and other members of the cast are granted so little screen time it is hard to be emotionally invested when darkness falls upon them.  With a show that features multiple arcs in which the characters are shown to progress in age from being kids to adults we never experience any situations that really change any of their personalities or allow us to identify with them on any level.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the New World\u2019s predictable and sluggish story line also leaves a lot to be desired.  The opening episode begins with a synopsis showing us the world in our present time and the humans that develop psychokinesis.  We also get information on why Saki\u2019s world is the way it is and why kids are removed from society for extremely obvious reasons.  Then the show progresses as if we do not have that knowledge and focuses on Saki and her group discovering these reasons for the first 17 or so episodes of the show.  Ummm\u2026.. why?  Why do we need to follow Saki\u2019s group and her friends discovering plot elements that we were so obviously shown in the first episode or beginning of the show?  Why is the show attempting to build suspense for answers we were already giving?  I\u2019m not exactly sure myself and for the first two arcs of the show the lethargic pacing along with Saki\u2019s oblivious reactions to the extremely obvious intentions of the Queerat character Squeeler was downright painful to sit through and comparable to having the most boring class in school during the final session of the day.\\n\\n\r\nThe largest and most glaring problem with this show is not only the worst aspect of the show but a problem that overflows into many of the show\u2019s other issues already stated.  I am of course talking about the extreme overabundance of exposition that plagues the show and why sitting through this anime was a bad experience.  When watching a fantasy or mystery anime set in a different world that is not meant to be our own the main aspects that draw the audience into the story should be engaging or interesting events that SHOW the similarities and differences between our world and the fantasy world allowing the audience to become emotionally invested in the setting.  Many other shows do this by showing off the beauty/horrors of the world through the soundtrack and cinematography.  Others do so by alluding to the consequences of what could come if our characters fail to conquer the world.  Some shows simply take a breather to show how characters live and interact with each other and the world on a daily basis in the fantasy realm.  Unfortunately, Shinsekai yori never does this, and to make matters worse what shows up more often is the lowest common denominator of boring conversations between the characters describing how the rules of the world work assuming we are already invested.  Most episodes are nothing but explaining\u2026.. and explaining\u2026\u2026 and more explaining.  The anime abandons all characterization as you rarely hear any natural human like conversations between anyone.  To make matters worse the anime is constantly throwing new terms at you as if it expects you to sit there and follow every bit of dialogue that consumes the majority of every episode.  This is made even worse when complemented by the fact that some of the dialogue is even focused on the political processes of how the world works as if CNN and Fox News weren\u2019t bad enough.  All of the constant dialogue and explaining never stopped in any part of the show resulting in a hollow and empty experience.\\n\\n\r\nThis all being said I do recognize that this show is heavily praised by many people in the great anime community, so I will gladly touch on the redeeming factors.  As I mentioned above, the setting of a futuristic world as a result of an apocalypse happening in our lifetimes is pretty cool even if it is underutilized.  Also, even if it is uncommon, the show succeeds in making you feel uncomfortable or uneasy at times through its graphic visuals.  The strange scenes focusing on the sexual tension that plagues Saki\u2019s group throughout the show also added to this uneasiness.  Lastly, even if it was simply explained rather than shown, the twist ending was pretty interesting and fit in well with the show\u2019s overall themes.  \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, these factors come nowhere close to making up for the overall headaches that plague this series.  Shinsekai Yori should be avoided at all costs. \\n",

            "content": "Shin Sekai Yori (SSY) is an incredibly ambitious anime that fails to deliver. The initial premise for the series involves a society desperate to control its citizens due to the fear that any one of them could become a mass murderer due to misusing their cantus (magical powers) or simply losing control. In a similar manner, the creators of SSY managed to lose control of their own narrative.\r\nIt only takes four episodes before the show veers off course from its original premise. The first two episodes introduce the village and the cantus school where kids disappear frequently. This gets forgotten for episode 3 where anexposition dump tells us the dark history of the world, and that nothing has changed over the past few centuries; humans still murder anyone they are suspicious of. All of this information is forgotten the very next episode as Satoru and Saki begin mass murdering Queerats. Finally, when the kids return to the village where there's a possibility for them to act on the information that they just learned, there's a time skip and they've been brainwashed to forget everything. \\n\\n\r\nThe show continues like this until the finale. Every development doesn't change how the characters behave because it's forgotten the next episode. Saki is completely incompetent with everything she does all the way through, even though the show tries to tell us how intelligent and capable she is. The other characters are just as incompetent with almost no personality. What this leaves us with is a show with bland characters making terrible decisions. The emotional parts of the story fall flat, and the climax of the story is completely ridiculous due to how easily it could have been avoided if any of the characters had any intelligence. The ending itself was insulting, trying to get us to empathise with a mass murderer who brainwashes his own people. \\n\\n\r\nThe elements were there to make this one of my favourites. The soundtrack was great, and the haunting atmosphere and sense of mystery were enough to keep me hooked. However, once the show was over, I was disappointed. The series introduces many concepts that could be important to our future and are worth discussing, but the show never goes into any depth and usually uses these ideas as a means for plot conveniences (especially death feedback). Unlike other anime that explore similar concepts, there are no lessons to learn from SSY. The biggest praise I can give to SSY is how well it manages to masquerade itself as an intellectual anime.\\n\\n\r\nI would not recommend anyone watch SSY.",

            "content": "\"Maria was born two weeks after me.  She was also premature, and her condition after birth was even worse than mine. I think if Maria had never been born unto this world, then untold numbers could have been spared.\" - Saki, Shinsekai Yori\r\nThe word \"Masterpiece\" is a loan-translation of the dutch word meesterstuk, meaning the work by which a craftsman attains the rank of legend in the eyes of history. It's not a word a true critic such as myself would toss around lightly. (and I will probably receive a lot of down-votes for the bold statement I am about to make) In fact,of the nearly one hundred series I've seen over the years, there are only 3 animes I would consider true masterpieces. In an effort to abstain from angering the masses, I'll keep that bit of unnecessary information to myself. However, Shinsekai Yori (\"From the New World\") is undeniably, unforgettably, and unapologetically a true masterpiece of its time, the most recent of my memory. That's right. This is the diamond in the rough you've all been looking for. Don't let its severely underappreciated rank on myanimelist deceive you, Shinsekai Yori is undoubtedly one of the three greatest animes ever made. This visionary work of art will shake you to the bone, break your heart, and electrify your conscience as it engulfs you in the wonders and horrors of the New World.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nShinsekai Yori takes place on Earth far into the future, in a post-apocalyptic world after mankind develops the ability to use PK, or psychokinesis, the ability to manipulate kinetic energy and reconstruct matter. The vehicle for the story is a group of five friends from the town of Kamisu 66, who find themselves in the same Class Group on their first day of school, after manifestation of their powers upon reaching puberty. The viewers are given insight into the day to day lives of these children, such as attending school, eating dinner, and going on camping trips. The starting point allows us to grow with them and experience what they experience as a child would, gradually unravelling the mysteries of the world around them. Mystery, of course, is the name of the game. For this New World is not quite like the one we know. For despite their grandiose powers and way of life, the humans live under a shroud of fear for both the dangers that haunt the night, and the darkness that steadily creeps within their own society. \\n\\n\r\nFrom there, we watch the children grow up, as they develop relationships, make discoveries, and find themselves in a perpetual midst of peril, sometimes as a product of their own trouble-making, and other times as a product of their fated circumstances. The beauty of this story is that all of these components are seemlessly and simultaneously integrated into the story, like a triple helix. There are so many parts moving all at once, but it's not overly complicated as to lose the viewers interest. As the story progresses, we dive deeper and deeper into the web of the world that the author weaves for us, picking up bread crumbs along the way, all while the characters endear themselves to us along a journey of discovery. It's all very realistic, and beautifully done. The story is not just about discovery and friendship of course. For there is a looming danger beyond the horizon. This of course, is the main plot of the story, and it takes a culmination of the entire series to realize and resolve. Without giving too much away, it's completely unpredictable yet brilliantly obvious and will hit you like a train. \\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, this story begins with our heroes after reaching puberty at age 12, but the plot actually time-jumps later on to their lives at ages 14 and 26, eventually concluding with our main character as she turns 36. Each of these main time frames (age 12, 14, and 26) corresponds with one of the three mythical creatures that's introduced to us early in the story, namely the Trickster Cat, the Karmic Demon, and the Ogre. These three myths act as a sort of theme and bookmark for each of the main chapters of the story, which can be further broken down into 5 separate arcs, if you include the False Minishiro and the Monster Rats. Confused? Good, you don't need to know any of that to truly appreciate this piece, for unlike similar stories in this genre, all of the mysteries of the future will be explained in due time in the most satisfying of ways. In other words, you don't need me to explain everything to you. Just be prepared to have your mind blown.\\n\\n\r\nWhat doesn't get fully explained, however, is what became of some of some of the characters (Shun, Maria and Mamoru), relationships (Satoru and Shun, Satoru and Saki), and plot elements (Saki's ability to reconstruct telomeres). A lot of that is sort of left unresolved or half-baked, perhaps out of necessity for time. The society's resolution and any potential move for change toward the end wasn't really explained either. But this does little to take away from the main point of the story. What does take away from the story however, is one particular episode (episode 22) that wasn't really up to par with the rest of the series. It was just sort of out of place in terms of quality because of some minor uses of deux ex machina (which was completely non-existent up to this point), lack of research (such as mistating how some well-known chemical compounds work), and just lackluster storytelling in general (in that it was kind of boring despite it's premise for action). It caused me to momentarily snap out of the world they had immersed me in for 21 episodes and back to reality. This one episode even caused me to question whether the producers had the talent to bring the story full circle (they did). But in essence, episode 22 is a great illustration of Shinsekai Yori's greatest challenge - it's own extremely ambitious expectations. But it's a good testament as to the strength of the series as a whole to say that out of this entire 25 episode series, there was only one episode that I found to be imperfect. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nA-1 Pictures did the animation for this series. You might remember them from animes such as Ao Exorcist, SAO, and most recently Aldnoah Zero. However, the art in Shinsekai Yori seems more akin to that of Princess Mononoke, except enhanced to a modern HD quality. The action and animation does remind me a bit of Ao Exorcist, however. In case you're unfamiliar, both references were major compliments. The scenery of the world is beautifully drawn. The characters, even moreso. The designs of the other creatures that inhabit the world were terrifying, but in a good way. The only thing I found a little strange about the artwork was that I felt that when the characters grew older, their necks got a little too long. But that's something that's hardly noticeable, without someone pointing it out to you. Oops. Regardless, the art is of a very high quality, and the design is spectacularly creative. The directoral contributions also deserves a shoutout. What more is there to say.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nLet's start by noting there's no opening song to this anime. That's mainly because the creators were focused on immersion into the world they created, and having an intro song would have come off a bit tacky for a work of art like this. It did have a closing song though, three actually, and they worked well. The first closing, Wareta Ringo by Risa Taneda was easily the best. It was very catchy, fit well with the story, and was maybe even Ipod worthy. The other two aren't very noteworthy since they weren't on the show very long, nor were they very memorable. The sound effects, and background music was all very well put-together, and was crucial to creating the air of tension and suspense upon which the story was set. The voice acting was also very good, although I've only seen the dub for this anime. I noticed that the male lead character for the english dub sounded a lot like the guy who played Sunohara in Clannad, which I thought was hilarious for some reason. The characters actually aren't very similar. I think they did a good job of changing the voice acting slightly as the characters aged while retaining their unique speaking styles, particularly with the deepening of tones. Although, they might have gone a little overboard with the female lead character's narrator voice (supposedly at age 36), which was way lower than the cutesy voice she spoke with for the vast majority of the story (between ages 12-26). It's not really that big of a deal though. In short, it might be worthwhile to note that this is one of those animes where you can literally identify each and every character by their voice alone. Pretty impressive if you asked me. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe thing that struck me as special about this anime was that none of the characters were driven by plot devices - the fate that typically moves stories along. In other words, characters didn't do things inexplicably merely to move the plot along. Rather, each character stayed true to who they were, and made realistic decisions based on their past experiences. They asked the same questions we would have asked, were we in their shoes, and made the same decisions we would have made. This all added to the sense of realism to the whole experience.\\n\\n\r\nShinsekai Yori really pulled away from the pack in terms of character development. While at the start of the series, there's a slight hint of cliche anime archetypes - the loud obnoxious wild child, the cute and quiet tsundere girl, the beautiful and outgoing best friend, the handsome genius, the random guy that doesn't talk. But as the story progresses, these archetypes are quickly dispelled as we discover something deeper within them at the core of who they are. They're all clever, lovable, and beautiful children. But they're also all unique individuals, causing us to miss each of them when they're gone. For example, with the main character, Saki, I couldn't help but find there was something about her that drew me as a viewer to her. The story strangely mischaracterizes this trait as \"strength.\" But by the time I reach the final scenes, I realized that what made her special wasn't strength or tenacity, but rather her endless capacity to love even the greatest of her enemies.  Even the antagonists were sympathetic, as they were acting in accordance with their own circumstances for survival. The lines of good and evil were blurred in a sense. There weren't any \"bad guys\" per se. It's much more complex than that. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of complexity, I'm sure most of you have heard of the term Love Triangle. Well, the relationship web in this anime is more like a Gyroelongated Triangular Bipyramid than any Triangle I've ever seen. Basically Girl A falls in love with Boy B, who's dating Boy A, who's in love with Boy B, who's actually in love with Girl A, who's dating Girl B, who's in love with Girl A, who sleeps with Boy A, who if you remember, was her love rival for the affections of Boy B. Girl A also sleeps with Girl B, and Boy A also sleeps with Boy B. Girl B also sleeps with Boy C, who's in love with her, even though she's in love with Girl A. \\n\\n\r\nStrange as it may sound, it all actually makes a lot of sense when you see it all play out, and the ones you hope will end up together strangely do so. Despite all this love tangling, there really isn't a whole lot of jealous infighting going around because the five friends all support and love each other very much, and for good reason. Plus, they have bigger things to worry about. It's all rather genuine. None of the relationships seem forced, which only makes each goodbye that much more heart-breaking. The dialogue is also fantastic, with one particular monologue in episode 16 being the best monologue I've ever heard from an anime.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing you may have noticed is that pretty much all of the characters are bisexual. One important thing to keep in mind though is that their world and social norms are completely different from our own, so it would be silly to judge them by our standards today. In particular, sex in their society serves a function beyond mere reproduction that's explained briefly early on and will make more sense if you've been paying attention up to the final arc. As such, sexual conduct is encouraged, regardless of gender or even age really. It's an interesting look at a society indifferent to modern groupthink notions of love and sex. There's no porn though, so don't worry, and you don't have to be bisexual to enjoy the show, obviously. But it's probably not for children under 13. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nVisionary, Immersive, Thought-provoking are the words that best describe this work of art. And at its core, it is simply that - a work of art. For this reason, the only category where this piece fails to receive a Perfect 10 is in the Enjoyment department. While I would easily rate this series above well-regarded heavyweight contenders such as Code Geass and Steins Gate, I didn't really enjoy this anime as much as I enjoyed the aforementioned shows.  That's not to say Shinsekai Yori is not enjoyable. The art and action were fantastic, the characters are likeable, and the story is one of the most thrilling and memorable I've seen in a long time. What I mean is that the show, in general, doesn't really seem all that concerned with entertaining you for the duration of its 25 episodes. There's no fan service or clever quips, there's very little humor, and the episodes only end with a cliffhanger every once in a while. This piece was more focused on story-telling and realism, like a true work of art.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that hurts its score as far as enjoyment goes is that it is extremely thought-provoking, which sounds like a good thing, right? Well, not for the average viewer who's looking to relax on his coach and kill some brain cells. This show will force you to take a good long hard look at who we are as a society, where we come from, and where we are headed, even going as far as to call into question what it means to be human. For that reason, it is not a lazy watch by any means. Those are some things to keep in mind when deciding whether and when to give this anime a shot. In my opinion, this is one that's best left for a rainy day when you've seen it all, but just want to have your mind blown one last time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Shinsekai Yori is one of the most memorable series you'll ever watch, and rewatch. It is a staple of hidden gem animes. Give it a chance, and if you have questions or want to discuss, feel free to message me. Until next time, Cheers!",

            "content": "\u201cShinsekai Yori\u201d which translates to \u201cFrom the New World.\u201d\r\nThere is something ominous about this anime. One can\u2019t help but wonder, if what was shown there might actually become a reality in the distant future. It has a powerful vibe and I can\u2019t help but feel Wells, Orwell and Huxley having a combined influence on the story structure; as far as utopia with mind-control, behavior control, and superiority among humans with huge potential differences are considered.\r\nYou just sit there and let the anime sweep you alongside it, everything in the anime are perfectly blended, and at one point you\u2019d feel whether the mangaka is actually fromthe future, writing out a story according to his experiences. Not only is the story deep, thought-provoking and frightening, it also shows a much darker side of humanity; what are the consequences of absolute law? What are consequences of secrecy in a society at large? How much of truth is there in the old saying \u201ccuriosity killed the cat?\u201d How far are we willing to go to protect humanity? Why are we the only beings with sentient minds?\\n\\n\r\nSo, what makes this anime such a grand piece, or put more aptly, an unappreciated gem.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation \u2013 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is done by A-1 Pictures, and well, they outdid themselves again. There is always a forbearing dread that something is lurking in the corner, the animation is brilliant, it shows the darkness with color, yet the scenery with vivid energy, the villages with tranquil, and the new creatures evolved in a thousand years so realistically, one would actually be inclined to believe that they might someday come around. The color achieves so much.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters \u2013 9/10\\n\\n\r\nHail redheads!\\n\r\nOne of the things that I loved about this anime was the characters. The characters were just\u2026..beautiful. For such an ominous story to flow one needs characters, and the characters here do justice to the story. They are shown in three points of their lives; childhood, teenage and adulthood. One might remain skeptical about whether character development through three stages of growth is possible in a 25-episode anime, but trust me, Shinsekai Yori pulls it off magnificently, this can be seen clearly with characters like Saki and Satoru, with Saki being the narrator, and the main character of the series. You feel at one with them; there was a time when I was actually saying to myself; \u201cPlease let these two survive.\u201d And not only the main characters, even despicable characters like Squealer show magnificent character development. But then again, who am I to call Squealer despicable?\\n\r\nDid I mention I\u2019m completely biased towards Maria?\\n\\n\r\nMusic \u2013 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOh. My. God.\\n\r\nThe music can be called something that is truly \u201cbeautiful.\u201d You can\u2019t help but fall in love with the haunting melody, chilling composition and how effortlessly, the music complements the story. It\u2019s like two very dark components kiss.\\n\\n\r\nStory \u2013 9/10\\n\\n\r\nA millennium from now, in Japan, exists a utopia. The protagonist, Saki Watanabe, lives in an idyllic village barred from the outside world. Her world is ruled by the people who possess the \"gods' power\" of psychokinesis. After finally obtaining her own powers, Saki enters the Zenjin Academy to train along with five other children: Satoru Asahina, Maria Akizuki, Mamoru Itou, Shun Aonuma, and Reiko Amano.\\n\r\nNot all is as it seems, however. In this utopian village, strange rumors about a monstrous cat that abducts children circulate, and students are said to disappear from the academy. The world and its history are much darker than they appear and humanity is on the verge of collapse.\\n\r\nWell, that\u2019s how the synopsis is described, and telling anything further would be spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nEntertainment \u2013 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nI binge-watched, in a hospital room, overnight, while munching on spice-less hospital food; that is how much I enjoyed this show. This is not for a casual watch, or for people who\u2019re easily bored or looking for cheap laughs or easy sexual gratification. If you\u2019re looking for a paced thought-provoking story, driving characters and won\u2019t compromise on sound and visuals, this one is for you.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, Shinsekai Yori is a beautiful yet underappreciated gem in the current anime scene, where people are more focused on anime with food for the body rather than food for the mind.\\n\\n\r\nOverall score \u2013 9.1",

I'm almost positive that I audibly groaned the first time I watched an episode thinking to myself \"wow, this looks insanely childish.\"  The art grew on me.  Just about everything with this anime grew on me and I'm pretty sure that's why I like it so much today.  I know there are people out there who watched this show when it premiered in 2012, but I feel like a lot of us overlooked it entirely and that's kind of a shame.\r\nThe story creeps.  It sticks with you.  It could just beme I am pretty malleable, but something about this show really irked and inspired me.  It's a sad reminder that most of us humans are reptilian in laymens terms and that we don't ever really learn, but somehow persist.\\n\\n\r\nEven when we probably shouldn't.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Please read this before you attempt to watch this anime. You may take this warning with a grain of salt as I have only watched 8 episodes but after being thoroughly pertubed, I have done a lot of secondary research and this is the conclusion I have reached. This anime is not worth your time and here is why if you want an explanation/evidence.  \r\n   From what I have gathered, the way this anime works is, excluding the first episode, the anime is entirely shitty filler until the final arc which I have heard people say is absolutelyamazing and deep and others say is clich\u00e9d and easily found in other anime. Idk, I didn\u2019t watch the end. But even the people that highly rate this anime generally agree that this anime is not enjoyable. Deep, dark, and thought provoking yes but not an enjoyable watch. Some people praise this difference in story telling and seem to be genuinely fine with the all moral no entertainment type of story. Others get off on thinking that being able to value something for reasons other than enjoyment makes them more mature than others and will dismiss all criticisms of the piece as being made by \u201cimmature simpletons\u201d whose brains are too underdeveloped to appreciate something this deep. But me personally I watch anime for enjoyment, and while a deeper meaning to anime is a very welcome and cherished experience, I am not willing to torture or bore myself to death myself just to obtain this.\\n\\n\\n\r\n    The reason I didnt watch the end is because the middle is so bad. There are various random plot elements scattered throughout the middle which means you have to sit through it to get to the end. So lets get into why the middle is bad.\\n\\n\r\n  There are various reviews labeled 3-4 (and even some 10s) on the MAL page that will perform a much better analysis of this shows specific shortcomings so I will simply list the basics without going into much detail or providing examples. Take them as you will but I can attest that I truly felt and recognized these issues while watching the anime and that I am not simply parroting the specific negatives others had identified while vaguely not liking the anime.\\n\\n\r\n1. There are no interesting characters and there is no character developement. \\n\r\n2. The world and is magic system while somewhat interesting, are very shoddily built and frustratingly vague or self contradictory\\n\r\n3. There is no \u201cgood\u201d comedy, action, or romance to temporarily sate you while you wait for the story to get istelf in gear at the very end\\n\r\n4. The 3 aforementioned factors combined lead to a very unnatural and uncomfortable watch as everything you know about good storytelling is ripped to shreds. You could pretty objectively say that the author did not write a good story. How much of this is on purpose snd how much of this is simply a lack of talent or foresight who knows and does it matter if its unenjoyable all the same.\\n\\n\r\nThere are definitely many more major issues I could talk about, any many more comparisons I could make to try and explain it to you, but for brevitiy\u2019s sake just know that the middle section definitely does not feel good. And for me it feels really bad.\\n\\n\r\nSo these factors combined make it so you sit through the most horrible mundane shit slowly gathering the few important plot points while you wait for something to happen. Considering this anime is 24 episodes long and the reviews of the ending have ranged from amazing all the way down  to meh, you really have to ask yourself if this is a gamble worth taking. I personally have made my choice and decided that it isnt worth the risk. To paraphase another reviewers words there are much better anime like Shiki and Eve no Jikan that deliver a similar and probably better highly philisophical/ thought provoking message without taking the time to drag you throught the mud and insult your intelligence first. So maybe if you have seen these other reccomendations and you have a lot of time and patience you can watch this but If not i would suggest watching them first and then still not watching this anime. Thats how much I personally disliked what I did watch.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThank you for taking your time to read this review. I very much am open to comments and critiques on my review as I am always trying to expand my critical mind, and this review was quite fundsmentally different from my other reviews. Also if you want to try and convince me that the ending message of shinsekai yori is sooo good and lifechanging  that it is worth me slogging through the rest even after watching the aforementioned suggestions first.",

Personally, I think the writers for the anime was trying very hard to be deep and artistic... They honestly should have just followed the manga a bit more closely.\r\nThe story was simply poorly executed, intriguing at first but then the characters themselves just kind of throw that out of the dust with their irrational thinking, and no,just because they are children and they are from a closed off utopia does not automatically excuse them of their stupidity.\\n\r\nWe start off with a sort of mystery about the world outside and the world in their little village and our main characters are given the \"truth\" from this weird... jelly.... thing... that was really unnecessary design in my point of view. The children are shocked about what they hear and before they can find out more they are discovered and immediately in trouble... If they were to go back to the village and just have their eyes opened to have fucked up their village is and they fight to survive or change it, that would have been a lot better!!! But no, instead we are put on a spot where they forcibly put the characters in an awkward and random almost sex scene which was just... what the flying fuck? Then a war between the queerats which literally came from nowhere. Since when could queerats actually SPEAK human language, I knew they had their own language but apparently they can speak like humans too? Fine, fine, I will accept that... we move on...\\n\r\nSatoru gets his abilities back and instead of getting back to the village for safety... he claims they have to fight them so that they aren't in danger anymore. Uhm, why not just hurry back to the village and ohh... I don't know.. GET HELP? Apparently killing and stuff is only bad when you do it to humans but the writers and director DOES realize that killing and cruelty to animals is one of the signs of becoming a killer or serial killer, right? And these weren't just animals, they had human intelligence. But oh well~ I guess that doesn't matter, despite the fact that they are in the future and that study is and was an easily known fact!! Pfft, not at all, no big deal if you destroy and entire colony of the species. As you can tell, this is when I really started to dislike the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThere's still a lot of reasons why I dislike the anime, I didn't completely finish it but I got pretty darn far and I decided I didn't have to put up with its stupidity any longer. The people who wrote the anime did not consider many things, they'd take one part of the extreme and just blow it up but then completely ignore the other. Stopping humans with powers from killing with it? In a society where having powers is the norm, it'd be like how we are living now, basically it's like everyone going through puberty, it's not a big deal. But the way they were saying things was like saying just because someone has a gun, they'd go out and kill people with it. It's not true. There's a lot of factors that go into someone actually killing another and just because a kid is causing trouble or is going through some angst doesn't make them a killer or that they will become one. The characters dismiss a lot of things really easily and it's not because they are brainwashed but rather that's how the writers wanted them to be. That scene where they were running away from that bad ass queerat because they were afraid the people would order it to kill them.... but instead of trying to run away from it all, they run back to the village that they thought wanted to kill them??? Why run away at all then? Where's the logic in that? Am I the only one who is seeing this?\\n\\n\r\nAs much as I would love to go on about it, I think this is enough to prove my point of my opinion. I was extremely disappointed by the series, I read some of the manga as well and I'm wondering if it's just the case of bad source material as well.",

            "content": "Every season airs an anime that is just far above the rest that are being aired at the same time. Every few years there are shows that turn out to become defining series for each period of time, usually every 5 years. However, only every 10 years can an anime be called a classic. What is the definition of a \"classic\"?  A classic is something that is outstanding, something glorious and considered held in high standards amongst a large group of people, but the most important aspect, is that the subject at hand usually defines something, rather than redefining something that already exists. Now,having just ended only a few months ago, it may be overconfident of me to state this, but Shinsekai yori is one of those animes that will progress onward and become a classic itself.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSometimes you have animes that try hard to look like  sophisticated works of art, but in reality they are nothing more than shallow, hollow stories that work in mechanics such as clich\u00e9s, overused themes, and attempt to cater to everyone, and I mean everyone that watches it. Shinsekai yori is an anime that does not do any of the above, it caters to no single audience, nor does it include clich\u00e9s that are commonly used in every other show. The most important reason why I mention this, is because Shinsekai's story contains a lot of controversial themes that make the viewer think, and it does not go easy on the viewer, the story will twist and turn your brain inside out, and just when you think it's over, it's not. It will do it again, and again, and again, but all the while it's a kind of mind bomb that you will thoroughly enjoy. It is a very deep show that if you do not pay close attention the whole time, you will miss out on a lot. The story makes you think a lot about reality and humanity itself, despite being based 1000 years in the future. Not only this, but the show uses real life history foils to base the characters off of. A lot of the characters are heavily influenced by our own world's history, think pre- and post- WW2, and even during WW2. You will not be disappointed in this show.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI have to admit, every anime has a downside to it. This particular show's downside is probably the artwork, there are a lot of scenes that often times look distorted and badly drawn. Characters will sometimes look a little off, and the art style gives the anime a sort of 2006 look instead of a 2012-2013 feel. However, because the story was so good to me, I really never noticed until I rewatched the show (I've watched it twice now).\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis show has among the most amazing soundtracks that I've ever heard for a TV show. That is because each piece greatly adds to each scene, and fits in so well. This show doesn't have an opening, but it does have two endings, that when both of them started to play, just gave you chills because of how intense the closing scenes were. Even at night, it would be 4 A.M. in the morning, but I always felt compelled to watch more and more because of how chillingly suspenseful it ended, and I craved more.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis show has characters that feel real, they feel like their right there in front of you, alive and breathing. Everything that happens to them, you will treat it as if it really just happened, you'll want to do something for them, but all you can do is sit back either in your seat or on your bed and watch. Every character has a unique personality that defines them from the rest. It's one of those shows, that the viewer finds out everything about the character when they find out, you're never told anything but you watch and listen and you'll come to know them. Every anime has characters that you both hate and love. However, I found that with this show, even the ones I hated at some point, I eventually came to love them later on. Each character is important to the story, no matter how big or small of a role they play.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI have given out very few 10s, because very few animes have deserved the title of masterpiece. This is definitely a must see show, and even if the beginning seems boring to you, keep watching, because this show isn't something that is supposed to make sense every episode, you'll only come to understand it when it's all said and done. \\n\\n\r\nAs a side note, there is a couple of episodes in which yaoi and yuri are themes, however these themes are only one or two episodes out of the 25, and they are very small in terms of being important, so it is skippable if it bothers you. Most viewers have turned this show away and rated it very low simply because of it, which is ridiculous. Just a fair warning, it is skippable.",

There is no much things that makes me feel it was a superb series.\r\nArt & Sound, 10 & 8.\r\nNot much I can say, as what you would expected from 2012 films it has an outstanding art, key animation, storyboard & sound.\r\nCharacters, 5.\r\nStill, a few section there shown a non-realistic reaction for a 12 years old boys & girls. Lack of emotion & a bit overreact, overreact & well played emotion was two diferrent things. But characters starting a bit better & fit at it's finest when they are grown up.\r\nStory, 5.\r\nIt start with a Sci-fi, & build theway it is. It was good, the complexity was what you would expected from a Sci-fi. But it start to get bored in the middle of the series. & starting their non-sense plot with lack of transition & so on with mediocre plot. Abselutely, I was seeing a lot of chance that this series is gonna be kicked, but unfortunately they throw away a lot of chance/possible outstanding plot & ending.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, 1.\\n\r\nYes, it has a beautiful artistic art, good sound, & the director was abselutely doing a great job. But it's not enough to make the whole series enjoyable, honestly I feel disgusting when watch this. Found no enjoyment for me, & thinking about to drop it many times.\\n\r\nBut I'm keep going to know \"is this series good?\", because seeing the rating in here looks like a promising series, & keep digging 'till the last episode. But, I was wrong.\\n\\n\r\nOverall's 5 for the whole series with small detail appraisal, fairly I say this is one of the most overrated series, I ever watched.\\n\\n\r\nLast, english isn\u2019t my first language, so please excuse any mistakes.\\n\r\nThank you.",

            "content": "Shinsekai Yori is an anime I have somewhat neglected ever since it started airing in late 2012. Upon first watching it, I found it slightly interesting, but wound up pushing it off to the side, watching only a couple episodes every month. Instead, I took to watching things more comical; I took to watching more joyous things or shows that fell into a genre with any other  adjective that could not possibly be used to describe what was contained within this anime. Well, eventually I decided I would just sit down and finish it all at once, powering through a good fifteen episodes orso. \\n\\n\r\nAnd let me tell you this:\\n\r\nShinsekai Yori has, hands down, the most gripping story out of anything I've ever watched before. And though it seems rather slow-paced in the beginning, it possesses so many important themes that most anime today seem to skip out on. IE: Humanity and its sociological properties, the rising and falling of societies, mortality, etc.\\n\\n\r\nBased on the novel by Yusuke Kishi, Shinsekai Yori throws us into a world where human beings with psychic power called \"Cantus\" control the land. Normal humans have died out, but other sentient creatures are still wandering the earth. The psychics have created a society in which children are sent to school in order to maintain and strengthen their powers. They are sent to school so they don't wind up dying. However, with limited space in the school and the towns, only the ones that show true promise will wind up living a long life.\\n\\n\r\nBut it doesn't end there. The humans are coexisting with an animal race called the \"Queerats.\" These creatures worship those with cantus as if they were gods, but what if the gods were to turn their backs on the queerats? What would happen then?\\n\\n\r\nIt is quite hard to describe the complexity of this story. And, to be honest, it only gets harder as it goes on. But that doesn't mean you should put it down like I did. If you truly want to reevaluate what you think about life, what it means to be human, follow this show to the end.\\n\\n\r\nI have dissected the anime into a few key components to better illustrate the different aspects of it.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 8/10\\n\r\nThough repetitive at first, the BGM will become extremely memorable as the series progresses. The music constantly riddles you with somber melodies in times of sorrow and does a fantastic job of taking your heart and squeezing it until it is barely able to beat.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\r\nCharacter development is nothing short of extravagant. Each character is memorable and increasingly different from the rest. Some are meant to be hated, some are meant to be loved. And with the amount of time lapsed inside this anime, it becomes obvious how characters are changing and how said changes are impacting the people around them. You, in a sense, wind up growing with the characters. And that is truly mesmerizing.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThough slightly different from most anime today, there is something very alluring about the art of Shinsekai Yori. It's extremely interesting to see how ancient folk/fantasy can fit in with human beings. And the amount of emotion the characters are able to display with their facial expressions is beyond anything I have seen before.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 20/10\\n\r\nPlease just watch this and pay close attention to the world enclosed within. It is like nothing you have ever seen. It is so intricate and so horrifyingly dystopian that you will not be able to look away.",

Heck I got to say that watching this show was more thrilling than a trip to 6 FLAGS MAGIC MOUNTAIN and that means quite something. When I watched episode 1, I could already feel that I may be watching something special. Holding back my urge to marathon the show (I hate doing it on a great show), I managed to prolong my viewing over a month.\r\nI clenched my fist, pulled my bedsheets, screamed at the TV,cringed and got traumatized by a \"certain episode\",and cried as I witness the lives of a group of kids unfold in an illusory utopia.\\n\\n\r\n=================\\n\r\n            THE REVIEW\\n\r\n=================\\n\\n\r\nThe great thing about this show is how it tells its story and how you get an understanding of its world and its inhabitants with each passing episode. This might be because its adapted from an award winning novel but a friend of mine said that the animation staff made a fantastic job of adapting it. \\n\\n\r\nFrom the first episode, there seems to be a lot of confusing things that the viewer might get lost and lose interest (There are still some unanswered questions by the end of the show). But if you stick with it, you are treated with a show unlike other.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is told through the experiences of 5 psychic kids living in a post apocalyptic world ruled  by psychics. You will experience their lives as children through adulthood. As far as personality goes, the author did a good job of straying away from making a typical character archetype. For the world, it is a great mesh of old civilization with somehow modern technologies. The amazing thing here is how the author made a pretty realistic society that fits in that world and create bizarre things/creatures that live in it.\\n\\n\r\nThe art/animation team did a fantastic job of creating a theme/palette that suits shinsekai's world. It is cryptic, bizarre, beautiful, and nostalgic. There are a couple of episodes with huge animation dips but it does not detract from my enjoyment (I event thought that it was intended at first lol). The sound did an amazing job in pulling you and immersing you in the world. I'm not a good critic when it comes to music but if I have to summarize my thoughts regarding this department it is: Intense, serene, and mystifying.\\n\\n\\n\r\n=================\\n\r\n              VERDICT\\n\r\n=================\\n\\n\r\nFrom the new world is one of those animes/adaptations that comes around once in several years. It tackles human behavior, shunned social practices, and a lot disturbing scenes.  It comes with a couple of faults but such is expected in a daring and thought provoking show like this.\\n\\n\r\nSo, to finally wrap things up and as a thanks to anyone who has read my longest review yet, I will now be giving a final score which comprises the built-in scoring system coupled with my personal bias and a fairly complicated process of mustering up my imaginary cantus and drawing the energy from the environment so that I can ask my homophobic future self for a fairly reasonable score that is not influenced, in any way, by teens making out and having a smexy time with the same gender and as I get lost in my own write up my future self finally told me the score of..\\n\\n\r\n9.2/10!\\n\\n\r\nA great show that makes the viewer feel like they also live in its world. Fans of video entertainment regardless of their genre/type preferences are advised to watch it and I'm strongly recommending to buy this show rather than stream it.\\n\\n\r\n Homophobes will surely despise the series though lol.",

            "content": "Seldom does one obtain or discover an anime that is quite frankly a world apart from its contemporary contenders and kin alike, and Shinsekai is indubitably an excellent example. Literally every aspect within this quite bizarre and exotic series is rather elaborate and convoluted though not to the extent of being incomprehensible, and is executed in a very adroit and ingenious manner. A vast amount of viewers would most certainly be deterred by the eccentricity that\u2019s abound throughout the entire story, and expediently dismiss its existence altogether.\r\nFortunately for those of you who are tenacious, determined, and more open minded than the vast majority and thatare desperately searching for an imaginative and compelling anime that\u2019s striking in execution, you\u2019ve just hit the jackpot.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is absolutely by no means a show you simply watch on a mere whim with a lax and laid-back mindset, Shinsekai will aspire to test your perspicacity and discernment, not to mention your overall intellect. The entire complex and esoteric universe as a whole is very deceiving, nothing is actually what it astutely presents itself to be on the surface.  Quite frankly the entire world within Shinsekai is brimming with a plethora of intricate and profound mysteries as well as secrets.\\n\\n\r\nThemes: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe mystery aspects of Shinsekai is what gives this series its magnificently impressive complexity and sense of constant breathtaking suspense. One would irrefutably surmise though that having a constant sense of mystery would ultimately would merely achieve in creating an ambiance that\u2019s repetitive and rather aggravating, thereby detracting the other aspects/themes as well as depreciating the plot itself. Fortunately the auxiliary themes efficiently and adequately counteract and even reinforce each other in a balanced manner so an individual theme isn\u2019t the driving force with the others merely being dragged along.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the horror, it delusively presents itself to be feeble and null, practically nugatory for being implemented in the plot in the first place. To wholly appreciate and comprehend the horror, it\u2019s imperative for the viewer to understand it\u2019s not intended, or for that matter even utilized for abrupt impulsive sentimental reactions to create anxiety. The foreboding and gradual intensifying eerie sense of horror is vital and crucial for addressing the important main points of the series itself, and does so flawlessly.\\n\\n\r\nThe supernatural and sci-fi elements that are incorporated are ingenious and very inventive, conceivably the most eccentric and idiosyncratic I\u2019ve ever seen in an anime yet. This is quite frankly the epitome of what true ingenuity and inventiveness can achieve if executed properly.\\n\r\nMain Points/Messages:  10\\n\\n\r\nI was astonished and quite impressed by the plethora of allegories abound throughout Shinsekai, it\u2019s certainly what makes this series memorable and distinguished as well. The most noticeable and noteworthy is that essentially by design, societies will indeed never be perfect no matter how much they desperately aspire to be.\\n\\n\r\nAs Shinsekai judiciously portrays, human beings wistfully are unpredictable and rather unstable creatures, varying tremendously in character from one another. So it\u2019s therefore ultimately no surprise society can\u2019t maintain constant adequate authority and supervision. This is especially accurate for the human townships in Shinsekais universe, where everybody has psychokinesis that interacts with their conscious selves, as well as the uncontrollable subconscious. \\n\\n\r\nThe human condition and other unique traits that pertain exclusively to Homo sapiens are also addressed in an intriguing and enthralling style, such as our everlasting sense of curiosity. Curiosity can basically be described as two sides of the same coin, as Shinsekai magnificently portrays. Once something manages to capture our curiosity, we\u2019re stubbornly determined to find an answer regardless of what consequences may be forthcoming as a result. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately for our primary group of protagonists, after uncovering several shocking secrets long kept concealed by modern society, or just simply forgotten. They will all come to the calamitous revelation that this will drastically change the very world in which they have comfortably grown accustomed to, forever.\\n\\n\r\nDolefully, power and corruption have always coincided with each other ever since mankind\u2019s inception, and Shinsekai makes this basis abundantly evident, albeit in a rather sensational manner. Whether power is utilized with sinister intentions or merely for order and stability over a particular community, regardless there will perpetually be a percentage of people that exploit it and misuse it. The cogent and quite meritorious portrayal of this is seen by both the dwindling species of mankind and by their contemporary intellectual equivalent, the race known as the queerats(and no I didn\u2019t make that up). \\n\\n\r\nLastly there is our rather intangible sense of morals, such as right and wrong, that we\u2019re so proud of and have strived greatly to maintain. Again, much as to humanity\u2019s dismay, can be and frequently is abused and misemployed just like power, whether deliberately planned or just of out of blind, perhaps even irrational impulse. This aspect of human nature is depicted in the most phenomenal, outstanding, and creative manner I\u2019ve have indubitably ever seen anywhere. \\n\\n\r\nWith the conclusion you shockingly and rapidly realize that there is clearly no actual definitive antagonist or protagonist within Shinsekai\u2019s ingenious and avant-garde plot. As the raging conflict between the queerats and humans arrives to a swift conclusion, you begin to fathom the genuine notion that morals essentially are fraudulent conjectures based on erroneous viewpoints and perception\\n\\n\r\nBackground Info/Setting: 9\\n\\n\r\nOur setting takes place within a future japan that has been drastically as well as fundamentally altered. This outlandish and hostile new world is a result of a catastrophic global conflict that ensued between \u201cnormal\u201d humans contending with the minority that obtained the seemingly divine gift of psychokinesis, or \u201cCantus\u201d as it\u2019s later known. \\n\\n\r\nHumanity is a mere fraction of what it used to be and queerats are now emerging as the dominant species and far outnumber humans. However mankind now wholly and thoroughly relies on Cantus abilities, which permits them to hold superiority and influence over the queerats and utilize them as a mass labor force for their own economy, not to mention survival. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\\n\r\nI will certainly do my utmost to restrain from revealing an excess of information concerning the story so bear with me.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot starts off with a notably different, almost utterly different tone and ambiance than what is experienced in the latter forthcoming majority of the series, it\u2019s certainly very deceiving. You are exposed to a group childhood friends in elementary school living blissfully within their seemingly flawless world. The only notable and apparent distinctions are that the landscape is dominated by overgrown lush vegetation and that psychokinesis is an integral part of \u201ccontemporary\u201d human society. Though as you and our primary protagonists will ultimately realize, the illusive utopia is shrouded in more grim and ghastly secrets than you could possibly envision. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are very contrasting and disparate, perhaps even more so than I previously realized, that\u2019s frankly just how deep and immersive each individual really is, it\u2019s incredible. \\n\\n\r\nAnother admirable and exquisite trait concerning the characters is that they are much more adept and intellectual than you often find in the vast majority of anime, which consequently makes them very compelling to follow. In addition I feel obligated to note that the protagonists are very free willing, not designed or utilized toward a particular viewer type, since throughout the plot you will find them at times willfully engaging in homosexual relationships, then converting to heterosexual companionship instead (don\u2019t be concerned or worried, there\u2019s a substantial reason for this that applies directly to the story).\\n\\n\r\nAlso I have to commend the utilization of dialogue for the script between the characters, as well as individual narrations. Since the most significant and vital portions of the story, which is a considerable majority is only addressed through the close knit dialogue. So make sure to pay special attention to long lengthy and prolonged dialogue orientated scenes, it\u2019s imperative.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe sound effects are quite wonderful and very remarkable in execution. In addition all the effects are uniform and balanced to near perfection. For any remaining sound effects that are utilized for aspects or creatures that obviously don\u2019t exist in the real world, they sound very plausible and believable.\\n\\n\r\nThe music was unexpectedly marvelous and vibrant, not to mention glamorous. Each individual BGM felt very distinct and was very instrumental and effective at setting the tone pertaining to its particular scene. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe art was unfortunately a little bland and lacking in detail, but an animation studio can only achieve so much with a tight budget. Though the art style is still praiseworthy and impressive to feast your eyes upon nonetheless. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\\n\r\nAs I have stated earlier in my review, Shinsekai Yori is the absolute epitome of pure originality, artistry, and inventiveness without a doubt. This series is very proficient and ingenious in regard that it manages to evoke an incredibly diverse variety of reactions from the viewer. You\u2019ll feel just as sentimental as you will be thought provoked by a certain set of events within just a single episode, and be left eager for more. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime does consist of a few drawbacks unfortunately though, the beginning is almost aggravatingly slow and lethargic in its pacing and progression, with little development and plenty of confusion. Though subsequent the first few episodes the series kicks off and starts showing its true colors, and man are they fabulous. If you\u2019re intently searching for an anime that has an expansive as well as extensive universe that isn\u2019t quite perplexing, with unique, immersive, and compelling characters and storyline, then I\u2019m delighted to inform you that you just found it.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019d sincerely appreciate any feedback, will gladly and eagerly listen to any legitimate opinions and comments of my reviews as to better future reviews, these reviews are designed to assist the viewer, not merely to state my opinions of it just for fun, thanks!\\n",

            "content": "Shinsekai Yori (\u201cFrom the New World\u201d) is a dystopian-esque anime that offers a unique outlook on the world after the almost complete destruction of mankind.  It was a series I was skeptical of initially with but grew to enjoy more as it went on.  I literally picked this anime blind from my collection to give it a go and was quite pleased with my decision in the end.  As you dive deeper into this vivid, complex world, you will soon see how realistic and intricate this series really is.    \r\nI\u2019ll be the first to admit I was kind ofoverwhelmed during the first 10 or so episodes of Shinsekai Yori.  You\u2019re dropped into this vast and beautiful world, in a matter-of-fact fashion, where humans have powers called \u201cpsychokinesis\u201d in which they can control tangible objects and light fires at will.  In was in no way outlandish for an anime environment.  But, the reason for humans having this power was initially unclear.  Was there a nuclear accident?  Was it discovered through scientific research?  Or perhaps these powers had always existed within humans, just waiting to be tapped of their potential?  I knew at this point, there was a lot to get my head around in the show, and it would take an open mind and excessive creativity to keep watching.  Giant cats lurking in the shadows, ready to eradicate children who don\u2019t live up to their potential, memory-altering events, exploding dogs and naked mole rats who exhibit human-like characteristics just scratch the surface of this anime\u2019s peculiar elements.\\n\\n\r\nThe only things I have an issue with in this series are these \u201cfalse-minoshrios\u201d.  Magically, right after you seem to learn about them, the main group of kids you follow in the story come across one while on a class field trip.  Conveniently enough, these minoshiros are walking libraries that contain literally every piece of information on the history of mankind, and divulge answers to any question asked by the children.  This struck me in an odd way, I call it the \u201cconvenience effect\u201d you see in some animes.  The kids wind up in a precarious scenario and may have dug a tad too deep into things they shouldn\u2019t know.  The episode right after they return home from the field trip is two years in the future, where hormone-crazed teen girls are sexually involved with girls, boys with boys\u2026 it was all a bit too sudden I felt.     I understand these episodes were necessary to plot development, but they were not as well put together as they could\u2019ve been.\\n\\n\r\nAfter about 8-10 episodes, Shinsekai Yori kicks it into high gear with a nonstop thrill ride of action, betrayal, loss and emotion.   You uncover more information about the memory altering, a tactic used so well throughout this world, and mankind becomes threatened yet again due to some unforeseen circumstances.  Unlike the beginning of the series, the latter 2/3 is brilliantly paced.  No dialogue is wasted between characters, and each interaction is purposeful in nature.  I understood the fear the humans had for their tight-knit world and how fragile it really was.  The fact that humans were \u201cprogrammed\u201d not to be able to kill or they would suffer from \u201cdeath feedback\u201d was a very original concept I appreciated quite a lot.  The queerats, though initially seeming to be nothing other than a being that existed in this land, proved to be quite cunning and devious in nature.  I had my own theories about their origination, and was pleased to see everything with them come full circle at the end of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe way the story was told was also quite interesting.  The protagonist, Saki Watanabe served more as a vessel for the viewers to uncover the story of this new world.  Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m just following that specific character\u2019s place in the setting, but with this anime it felt more overarching.  I also enjoyed the human\u2019s interaction with the queerats.  The queerats understood their relative insignificance in the pecking order, and I originally thought they were used almost as an experiment for the humans to survey.  They worshipped the humans as \u201cgods\u201d, but still made attempts at furthering their technology which became apparent as the series went on.  It was a clever relationship that was remarkably described through the series.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, I actually felt like the characters were one of the weaker areas of the show.  The main character Saki, is a strong willed girl who obtains her powers relatively late in her childhood and loves the companionship of her school group.  The narration elements of the anime are sometimes made with an adult version of her voice, evident that the story is being told in past tense as more of a recollection.  She\u2019s not necessarily a weak character, and maybe I was a little distracted by the complexity of the world around her, but something felt off for me.  The other major character Saturo, served as a loyal backbone and aide to Saki when the going got tough.  He put on a stone veil but deep down was torn up about the world he lived in and the many questions he had.  He was a good addition to the series and balanced out Saki decently enough.\\n\\n\r\nThe other supporting characters, most notably in Saki and Saturo\u2019s school group, were relatively ordinary.  I never really grew attached to any of them, and could\u2019ve been substituted with alternate personalities with little or no notice.  The characters were not what kept me watching the anime as binge-like as I did, so I wasn\u2019t necessarily upset that they were sort of bland.\\n\\n\r\nI really loved the artwork in Shinsekai Yori.  As previously noted, the unique take on the post-apocalyptic environment made me look at the genre in a new light.  The land was colorful and beating with life, an interesting contrast to the outlook the humans had on life.  The character models were also well constructed, although sometimes looked sloppy during action scenes.  I also valued the level of detail that was involved drawing the various creatures of this world.  The cats were all differently designed, and the queerats had subtle humanoid characteristics.  \\n\\n\r\nI was surprised to see that the anime\u2019s opening was not always present.  I kind of got used to it not being there, though it wasn\u2019t bad.  The ending theme was quite good and left me with a sense of fulfillment at the end of each episode.  The music present during the show was nothing noteworthy, but it did add to the overall vibe quite well.  Voice acting was average, for some reason I really liked Mamoru and Saturo\u2019s voice actors though.  They were very distinctive in nature.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Shinsekai Yori is a beautiful rendition of shows we are used to seeing in a different light.  It\u2019s a rare opportunity to see a series stick its head out for originality, and this anime earns full honors for it.  It is not without its flaws\u2026 but it is definitely a must see for any anime fan!  \\n",

            "content": "Shinsekai Yori, a series widely adored and praised for its twists and turns and the strength of its psychological thrills. I had been looking forward to this series for a while, and I must say that after finally finishing it, I am rather conflicted. I had been warned that this series would be a slow burner and it would ramp up in time. These things are true. But in the end, I just didn\u2019t enjoy this series too much. \r\nAt its worst, Shinsekai Yori is dreadfully boring and confounding, and at its best, it is tense and even chilling. It engages with some pretty seriouspolitical and moral themes and handles them quite nicely. However, I consider the act of judging anime on these themes alone to be one of anime watcher\u2019s most misplaced biases. A show needs to do more than just put themes in writing to make them come alive to the audience. And a show cannot sacrifice too much just to get these themes realized in a certain way. This is where Shinsekai Yori falters. What does this show do to engage the viewers before the final act? It certainly tries, but to me, it certainly falls short. \\n\\n\r\nMy personal bias on this show, and shows like these, is that I just don\u2019t love dystopian psychological thrillers. I think they pose a lot of interesting questions and scenarios for the audience to unpack, but so does a book (more concisely and explicitly at that). Whether the topic at hand is best set as a story or as a study is entirely debatable, but I tend to think that there is so much potential content (and biases that must come with any satisfying plot resolution) that it is best to just have it in writing. Though, to be fair, Shinsekai Yori fleshes out its content well and addresses its biases perfectly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Pros and Cons]\\n\r\n[+] One of the better \u2018villains\u2019 in recent memory.\\n\r\n[+] A strong final act that definitely keeps the audience guessing. Just how deep does the rabbit hole go?\\n\r\n[+] Neat use of time skips. Regardless of the quality of the plot in each interval, the skips themselves are at least functional and effective.\\n\r\n[+] Diverse art style, which can lead to some very inventive presentation. \\n\r\n[+] Sound design is good. Sound tracks initially leave a huge impression, though they begin to get a little repetitive and lose their impact.\\n\r\n[=] When art is \u2018standard\u2019, which is most of the time, the presentation is only average.\\n\r\n[-] Voice acting, while maybe more realistic, should definitely be livelier.\\n\r\n[---] Sacrifices far too much enjoyment in the first two acts. \\n\r\n[---] Characters are boring and completely lack distinct personalities. \\n\r\n[---] Character design has so many problems.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Character Design Matters]\\n\\n\r\nShinsekai Yori has a problem with its characters, from every angle. But I want to talk about the problems that the characters have from a design perspective. I think that the character design is in fact so poor that it, on its own, makes the characters worse than they ought to be. \\n\\n\r\nFirstly, all the characters look the same. They have the same facial structure, they have the same pale complexion, they have the same style of mouth and eyes, they have the same outfits, they have similar voice acting. Sure, this is maybe more realistic, but that isn\u2019t really the point of anime. One of anime\u2019s greatest strengths as a genre is that it is allowed to do things that normal live-action film cannot \u2013 it can more freely design its visual attributes to better fit the challenges that these visual attributes must face. Characters are simply better if they have more distinguishing features. It allows audience members to attach their thoughts to each characters visual presentation. Or they allow our characters to communicate their unique attributes visually, rather than verbally. When the characters are so similar, what can the audience anchor themselves to?\\n\\n\r\nSecondly, the specific design attributes chosen limit the expression that these characters can evoke. Small mouth, small eyes, and neatly contained hair make it difficult for the characters to communicate their ideas visually. This is important. Anime isn\u2019t all about writing, and making the most of anime means putting thought into each channel of communication that it offers. In this series, the range of emotion that the characters can visually evoke is very small. This gives the characters themselves fewer tools to work with, and ultimately gives them less \u2018oomph\u2019. We want oomph!\\n\\n\r\nI think it is very telling that my favorite characters of the show, Kiroumaru and Squeera, aren\u2019t human at all. They have unique presentations. Kiroumaru specifically does work with his mouth alone to visually communicate his thoughts. And again, even among the human characters, my favorite is Shisei, who wears a mask. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n[A Big Finish, but a Small Ramp]\\n\\n\r\nHow much is too much? Shinsekai Yori sacrifices so much just to have a solid ending. The first act is just\u2026 so boring. It is very difficult to keep track of where the characters are, why they continue to do what they are doing, and what the point of it all is. Oh, and it just isn\u2019t fun to watch. These episodes are necessary, to some degree, but it would be nice if they weren\u2019t just a whirlwind of locations and poor \u2018action\u2019 scenes. The second act is focused more on the characters, which could be good\u2026 if the characters were any good. I don\u2019t really care for any of them. At this point, it feels like all the characters are going to have similar fates, and we are just waiting for Saki\u2019s turn. This never comes to fruition, and the audience is left hanging again.\\n\\n\r\nI think that, for the sake of the plot feeling thrilling the final act, it makes sense for the first two acts to be pretty empty. There needs to be enough information and loose ends so that when the pieces are put together, the result is actually unexpected. However, while this period must have some sort of setup involved, it doesn\u2019t mean that it has to be boring. For instance, good humor or action can be applied in these areas to make them much less burdensome yet still low in plot content. Hell, even just having a more engaging, tentative plot line could hold interest too. But I think that sacrificing like 16 episodes of content just to get a strong finish is a pretty poor choice. I guess maybe if the ending were, like, the greatest thing since sliced bread. Then it would be OK. But it isn't. So it's not. \\n\\n\\n\r\n[Rating]\\n\r\nStory: 5\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nCharacter: 2\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: 5\\n",

            "content": "The Bitter Truth\r\n(please note that it's a spoiler-free review)\r\nWe love fantasizing about the future of humanity. We shake our fists at the stars and anticipate amazing discoveries. Through oceans of blood and suffering, we keep pushing forward, always so hopeful about better tomorrow. The faith we have in ourselves is in fact justified, as we can easily trace the progress made throughout history. Humanity has become more civilized, open-minded, peaceful. And even though there's still room for improvement, our achievements to date give us a firm conviction that we're on the right track... but really, are we? What if it's all just a lie wekeep repeating, a convenient lie that keeps us going? What if deep down in your heart, nothing has changed, ever?\\n\\n\r\nWe all have gone through that kind of story at least once in our lives. A story that you get hooked  on with time rather than from the get go, one that you don't necessarily enjoy as much as some more accessible ones. And still it leaves a mark on your soul that won't disappear even long after you finished it. Shinsekai Yori is definitely one of those. Set one thousand years in the future, the story of this anime bears no resemblance to any sci-fi futuristic predictions I have ever encountered. Some would expect a highly developed, space-faring civilization, others would settle for a singularity-based vision of human evolution or even a post-apocalyptic dystopia. That's where the series has already broken with convention. There's almost no technology there whatsoever, except for electricity(very scarce) and some rudimentary accessories. The closest reference for the world depicted in Shinsekai Yori would be the pre-medieval Japan, actually. If I were to classify the setting in some way, I'd say it's a modern psychological fantasy, as it doesn't dabble in hard science and instead draws on an elegant yet improbable concept of cantus. Telekinesis (on the molecular level), as this is what the term refers to, is handled with much care and insight in Shinsekai Yori. It's not just a superpower, it's a potent yet dangerous ability that can lead its user to almost godlike achievements... but also to unspeakable atrocities.\\n\\n\r\nThe aura of mystery and menace pervades the story long before it unveils any of its dark secrets. The animation, even though technically inferior to some high-profile productions, boasts a stunningly beautiful artistic design. Accompanied by equally effective soundtrack, as eclectic as the anime itself, Shinsekai Yori is a thrilling and unsettling ride through a bitter-sweet utopia. It's all the more effective due to profoundly allegoric character of the series. It is an elegant and painful critique not only of the caste-based society, government and blind faith in it, but also of the unspeakable evil that lies dormant in all of us. If only for the unprecedented setting and concept, the anime is worth watching. If, however, you keep a lookout for ambitious productions that aren't afraid to venture where no one else does, Shinsekai Yori is a must-see.",

            "content": "The only way to describe this anime for me is 'waste.' Specifically, wasted potential. Let me first say that the art and overall acting are excellent throughout the series. The characters are compelling and realistic. The first 15 or so episodes are something truly special, there is such a strong and intriguing dystopian aspect to the series, you can feel the terror of the children as they slowly realize why and how their peers go missing, and whether they'll be next. You're forced to consider hard questions; what exactly is the greater good? what sacrifices would you accept to maintain 'peace'? Would you give upfreedoms, even your basic rights, for what you perceive as a better chance for your species to survive? Both sides of the issue are presented logically and fairly. In addition, there are rather deep and complex relationships between characters, and you can easily see these interpersonal relationships fueling a very compelling storyline later on. The first 15 or so episodes were pure excitement and the series was incredibly promising. Then came only disappointment.\\n\\n\r\n*SPOILERS BEGIN HERE*\\n\r\nAround episode 17 they completely abandon the dystopian aspect and instead focus on all-out war with monster rats. It's like they took EVERYTHING that showed promise in the beginning, balled it up, and threw it in the garbage. watching the last 6 or so episodes was a pure disappointment. They abandoned the dystopian considerations in the plot. they forget key characters, leaving you to ask why those characters were even in the plot to begin? why did the plot totally abandon shun? why spend over half of the fucking series building this absolutely riveting social scenario and then completely cheapen it just so you can cheesily bring in an ogre into the plot?? WHY? why did shun die, when his death means very little to the overall plot? it was also disappointing that maria and mamoru died off-screen as well. the show should have gone in the direction where the protagonists strive to overthrow or protect the current societal status quo. You could even pit them against each other, some choosing to rebel and others not, and old friends and lovers are forced to fight. That would have been a much more compelling storyline. the latter half of the anime felt like sending your kid who wants to be a doctor off to college and having them flunk out and develop an opiate dependency. I'm truly sad that the story turned out the way it did, it really was on it's way to being one of my favorites before they completely derailed the theme of the anime. In the end, i still enjoyed it overall because of how deep the characters were, but the plot did a disservice to the amazing characters.",

            "content": "If you look at the various 2013 anime that sparked your interest, or made you watch it through the end, Shin Sekai Yori probably wasn't on that list. But it definitely deserved to be. I for sure, didn't even hear of it until this year, and I wish I could have enjoyed it while it was airing\r\nThe story surrounds our main female protagonist, Saki, and her adventures in a sort of utopia established after the creation  of humans with psychic powers. So far, the story doesn't seem all too great. We've heard of dystopian or utopian story lines before, and psychic powers is nothingnew to the anime world. What is interesting is the way this society runs; it is different then anything I've seen before. I can't really reveal anything without spoiling the plot line, so you will have to see for yourself the intricacy, and even morbidness, of this utopia. \\n\\n\r\nThe story progression is quite interesting too, we start the show when Saki is twelve, a few episodes later we time skip to when she is twelve, and finally, twenty-six. A couple of shows have tried this method before, but none of them had flowed like SSY had. Even the multiple flashbacks that occurred were woven brilliantly into the animation.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, the animation was spectacular. Don't be fooled by the characters flat colors, the scenery is breathtaking. The only way to define this style is sharp and clean. It worked very well with the overall mood. The only criticism I had  was that sometimes, the background was too dark for me to see. It wasn't necessarily off-putting, because the characters were highlighted nicely, but I think I would have enjoyed it more if it was a bit brighter in those parts.\\n\\n\r\nThe music was also very nice. There is one in particular I like (which I unfortunately do not recall the name for) which includes a sort of humming/singing obviously by children. Each song was played in exactly the right time and place, and some played with heartstrings so much, it drove me to tears. But I do wish there was more variety. I could only distinguish about 4-6 different songs, not that I'm complaining! As I said, they were all amazing and I was surprised I didn't get sick of the songs repeatedly playing. Which sparks a thought, could they have done this so that it would invoke emotions brought in another scene, where the same song played? Something to think about while watching the show...\\n\\n\r\nOh boy, the characters. I could go on for days about the characters. The main characters are Saki, our lead, Satoru, a laid back but mischievous boy, Shun, a more mature and intelligent boy, Maria, Saki's childhood friend and lover, and Mamoru, a shy and introverted boy with a love for art. I honestly did not care for Saki or Maria, and here is why. Saki sometimes seemed like the useless female trope, when I was expecting a strong female lead. She always volunteered to help, but was put down and didn't think much of it. Maria just didn't gel with me. Although the story places a lot of emphasis on her character ( as the story is from Saki's point of view), I didn't like her because I never felt for her. I did really like Mamoru and Satoru though, and Shun was definitely a personal favorite.\\n\\n\r\nI will warn potential watchers there is some shounen ai/yaoi(if you would even consider it yaoi) in the first couple of episodes, but please don't drop it just because of that! It is a great watch that deserves a larger fan base, but unfortunately not many people can look past the sexual themes.\\n\\n\r\nI highly, HIGHLY recommend this to anyone seeking something apart from the traditional anime, or even just someone who can enjoy a deep,rich story line. This show reduced me to tears, which is an amazing feat not even the saddest movies can accomplish. Even if you don't think it's for you, give it a shot.",

What has kept my attention is the plot. As someone who has not read the novel, I'm interested in finding out if the village has some sort of dark secret/if they're founded upon a lie. \r\nAll in all, it's passed my \"three episode trial\", and I will continue watching.",

In the future, every single human is psychokinetic and they live in closely knited communities, seemingly living utopic lives. As the story proceeds however, the world of Shinsekai Yori is revealed to be anything but ideal, and how the communities came to form their society in this way.\r\nThere are often flashbacks to the past (even during an era 500 years after our time), but they are by no means confusing. They serveto explain to the viewer the peculiarities of the world and how delicate is to find balance in this world.\\n\\n\r\nThe worldbuilding is simply excellent, whereas the plot is simply captivating and shocking as hell, on par with some of the high-tier thriller anime. There is constantly an aura of mystery and thrill, and many drama moments that are bound to touch the viewer. \\n\\n\r\nSadly, the sole reason I couldn't give this anime a straight 10/10 was the art. Due to the fact resources were relocated from A1 to another, more popular anime, the art and the colors often seemed rather low-budget to me. Still, considering the budget, the overall work was nothing short of thrilling.",

            "content": "Hello everyone this are Shawn aka TheKazeTrigger and welcome too my next MVM Entertainment review.\r\nFor this one we are taking a look at Shineseki Yori/ From the New World.\r\nWith that out the way let us begin.\r\nStory.\r\nThe story of Shineskai Yori are set in a version of japan around the thousand years in the future. Overtime humans have evolved and now they contained the power of some form of telekinesis.  The people are living theyre peacefully in there utopia society. Theyre using humanoid brad known as muster rats too do they labor for them.\r\nShineseki Yori inderdous five children Maria Mamarou, Saki, Shun and Satrou theybefall them as they grow up discovering more and more about there seemingly perfect society and learning more about themselves in the process.\\n\\n\r\nI can\u2019t say anything more about the story because it will give away major spoilers because this are one of those animes that you don\u2019t want too be spoiled at any cost. That are because Shineseki Yori are a masterpiece at foreshadowing.\\n\\n\r\nNow before I dive into the characters of Shinsekai Yori am going too address the world building.\\n\\n\r\nYou see world building are very important in fictional because not only it makes the live of the characters feel alive and interesting but it makes youre world have a theme and purpose of existing.\\n\\n\r\nIn anime form theyre should be least decent too great world building in anime genres such as fantasy, steampunk, mecha, history, game, adventure, senien, shouens, post-apocalyptic and action.\\n\\n\r\nHow does this relate too Shinsekai Yori?\\n\\n\r\nShinsekai Yori has the best world building I have seen in anime fiction.\\n\\n\r\nNot only the world are very well explored from the monster races, showing the atmosphere of each location in perfect detail how the games works when using the power telekinesis, but even minor things such a fallen leafs, objects and scenery have a purpose and theme that makes the world of Shinsekai yori believable.\\n\\n\r\nEverything you see in Shinsekai Yori has a purpose and a theme behind it.\\n\\n\r\nOne of more thing that I want too mention in the story and world-building part of Shinsekai yori are episode 4 for Shinsekai Yori because not only it has great use of heavy dialogue but it combines the world building and heavy dialogue together in a visual format meaning you will see the world being explored visually while the heavy dialogue are explaining the world in great detail. You may not understand everything the first time but after you watch the same episode two too three times you will finally understand it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the story of Shinsekai Yori are such a masterpiece in the terms of its content, foreshadowing and world-building\\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIf you guys don\u2019t know I prefer a character driven narrative over a story because how can youre story function without good or decent character. Unfortunately, Shinsekai Yori main characters are kinda of a mix bag.\\n\\n\r\nFirst up we have Saki whom are our main female lead in this entire story. She\u2019s one of the better characters in the story and she has great character development not too mention a well written one\\n\\n\r\nNext up are Satrou whom are my favorite character in Shinsekai Yori.\\n\\n\r\nAm not going too spoiler progression for this characters but seeing how he changes as he grows older are very interesting too watch. He starts off as youre everyday joker that likes too mess around with people than greatly evolves into someone whom takes his morals and opinions seriously as he becomes an adult.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I really liked his character growth in the series that makes him my favourite character in the series.\\n\\n\r\nNext we have Shun.\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion he was one of the weaker characters in the show because he was kinda underdeveloped. I will admit he has a great role in the story which I won\u2019t spoil and has decent enough character development. But the end of the day he was still kinda of an underdeveloped character despite him being a likeable character on screen.\\n\\n\r\nNext up are Maria.\\n\\n\r\nAm personally mixed with her because while she are a very important in the story but her characterization was rather weak at some points but unlike our next character am going too mention she are a likeable and enjoyable character too watch on screen.\\n\\n\r\nLastly we have Mamoaru whom are easily me least favourite character of Shinsekai Yori.\\n\\n\r\nToo be honest he was an annoying character in general. Like Shun he has an important role in the story but like with Saki he\u2019s characterization was not that good. On top of that he\u2019s whiny personalty really made this character annoying too watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Mamoaru are an annoying character that I don\u2019t like and he was the second weakest thing of Shinsekai Yori besides the visuals which I will get in too an it.\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters are fine for what they were but theyre was one standout character that I can\u2019t talk about due too spoiler\u2019s but all I can say he are a very interesting multi dimension villain that I ended up sympathising which are something a villain hasn\u2019t been able too do in quite some time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall while the characters of Shinsekai Yori are not worthless it was honestly hard too sympathies with few of the characters due too the bland and annoying personalities. Least the most characters of Shinsekai Yori were likeable and enjoyable too some degree.\\n\\n\r\n7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation.\\n\\n\r\nAh Shinsekai Yori why do you have inconstant visuals. Done by A1 Pictures the same studio that gave Fairy Tail, Black Butler, Erased, Shigatsu and Sword Art Online and it\u2019s really sad too say this but the visuals were kinda poor in some areas.\\n\r\nI may heavily dislike Sword Art Online for having terrible arcs, bad world building, awful characterisation too the characters but something that I cannot delay that it was animated pretty well. In fact, the second half of SAO airing at the same as the first half of Shinsekai Yori and trust me it tells. Back too the visually the character designs have a lack of shadow and they look really flat. Also, the lack of colouring on the character designs made them look rather dull.\\n\\n\r\nThe background design look decent with some detail on the atmosphere but theyre nothing too write home about. The lighting for the most part are really good and it makes some scenes look great.  Episodes 5 and 10 in my opinion have some of the worst animation I have ever seen in modern anime period. The textures were weird the character designs were changed for the worst and the cinematography are just really bad. Theyre were too, many close-up shots too the point where you can\u2019t even tell what are happening.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the visuals were decent at best and terrible at worst. 6/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for Shinsekai Yori are great. I adore how it manages too make everything sound throw and ominous using a great variety of instruments that creepy child choir. Not too mention ever track from this show really fits the tone and world building that this show has too offer.\\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly Shinsekai Yori doesn\u2019t have an opening but it has two ending themes. The first ending theme it\u2019s a really calm catchy piece that I adore not too mention the animation are beautiful. The second ending are fine and a good listen but the first ending theme are superior in every way.\\n\\n\r\nNow for dub or sub and too be honest I found the dub for the decent. Sure, some of the voices were rather bland but for the most part they did a pretty decent job with the roles.\\n\\n\r\nThis are kinda surprising because most Sentai Flimworks dubs I seen are either mediocre or bad. Theyre were a few exceptions every now and then but those chances are very slim.\\n\\n\r\nIn general, Shinsekai Yori has a decent dub but the sub are much better for this case.\\n\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts.\\n\\n\r\nDespite me bring kinda harsh at points during the review I love this anime.\\n\\n\r\nYes, it has major flaws in the terms of characterization for some charters and the visuals not very inconstant. The story of Shinsekai Yori are just amazing that some of the best foreshadowing I have ever seen in anime and the world-building of Shinsekai Yori are just wonderful. Not too mention the soundtrack are amazing and well thought out.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I really love this anime despite with flaws.\\n\\n\r\nI give Shinsekai Yori/ From the New World a 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nShinsekai Yori are available from MVM Entertainment in the UK on DVD and Blu Ray.\\n\r\nMy anime recommendations\\n\\n\r\nKokono Connect\\n\\n\r\nDennco Coil\\n\\n\r\nShiki\\n\\n\r\nPsycho Pass\\n\\n\r\nNoein\\n\\n\r\nKemono no Souja Erin \\n\\n\r\nAnyway this was Shawn aka TheKazeTrigger and I will see you guys next time.\\n",

            "content": "A classic example of curiosity killing the cat, Shinsekai Yori, follows the lives of a pair of five young children: Saki Watanabe, Satoru Asahina, Maria Akizuki, Mamoru Itou, and Shun Aonuma.  A millennium later, Japan has become a self-proclaimed utopia. However, the children see it, the parents know it, and the community hides it: there is something horrendously wrong with their society. Rumors circulate about problematic children disappearing, and questions are not only highly discouraged, but also risky. It\u2019s immediately apparent that this community was never intended to be a utopia; rather the community was meant to emphasize the value of philanthropy, at thecost of \u201cunfit\u201d individuals. The fear \u201crandom chance\u201d eradicated the possibility of a utopia; outliers\u2014defective people\u2014cannot be prevented but they can be removed. \\n\\n\r\nShinsekai Yori borrows from the science fiction genre to provide both innovation and explanation. People in the small society have all been subject to genetic modification\u2014specifically altercations in sexuality\u2014and they follow a strict \u201cPK\u201d system, where if they kill or attack another human they shall self-destruct. In addition to the \u201cPK\u201d system, humans have mental blockages which prevent them from considering harming each other. Furthermore, individuals are given special powers known as \u201cCantus\u201d, otherwise known as telekinesis. The powers are unique to each character, and there is a certain code of ethics that each individual with cantus is expected to follow. \\n\\n\r\nThere is also another major species in the series called \u201cQueerats\u201d or \u201cmonster rats\u201d. \\n\r\nThey\u2019re grotesque looking rat-like creatures with human speech and thought. Although, some of the Queerats are considerably intelligent, a majority of the Queerats throughout the series are depicted as animalistic and more instinct orientated. Their main purpose is to provide slave labor for the humans\u2014much to their dismay of course. \\n\\n\r\nSexuality is an important aspect to the show. The characters will be shown from ages 12-26. As you watch, you\u2019ll notice most characters are bisexual, but there are some characters which can be considered primary heterosexual. Don\u2019t mistake sexuality and romance for fan-service, there\u2019s relatively none of that. At times, the PDA levels can be a little discomforting for some\u2014regardless of sexual orientation\u2014but it\u2019s all with good purpose. Romance isn\u2019t a primary focus, but it is essential to the overall plot. Alongside romance, there is platonic love, otherwise known as friendship. Shinsekai Yori develops relationships beyond sexual desire, but there\u2019s actually more \u201cextrospection\u201d than introspection. Most of the characters learn and grow through their environment, rather than going through self-revelations. \\n\\n\r\nSince sexuality is so lenient, the anime effortlessly\u2014or maybe inadvertently\u2014distances itself from gender-roles. The reason the deconstruction of gender roles succeeds is because nothing is shoved into the viewer\u2019s face. You won\u2019t even notice that gender-roles aren\u2019t prominent, because it\u2019s not something you\u2019d really look for.  For instance, not all females are strong-willed, but neither are all males, that\u2019s because the focus is character, not gender. That\u2019s what real life is like, gender stereotypes exist, but cannot represent each individual\u2014which many forms of media seem not to get. Many shows have the mistake of simply switching gender-roles, as if they\u2019re trying to claim \u201chey our show isn\u2019t sexist!\u201d; Shinsekai Yori does not do that. One of the perks of shifting away from stereotypes, is that the characters are much more interesting and relatable.  \\n\\n\r\nAlso, it should be understood that Shinsekai Yori is very plot intensive, therefore, you have to pay attention each episode, as even the tiniest incidents often serve as explanation for future events. There are some unexplained plot-holes in the anime, but many viewers claim \u201cplot-hole!\u201d too quickly. Often times, the so-called \u201cplot-hole\u201d has actually already been explained in previous episodes, or will be explained in the following scenes. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the most vocal critiques of the anime concerns its characters, as some find them plain or underdeveloped; I disagree on both accounts. Although each character is certainly unique, they each steer clear of excess. Often times, characters receive an excess of stereotypes, the loud out-spoken boy is limited to loud and vocal actions, or the most intelligent girl never makes mistakes. I would argue that Shinsekai Yori maintains a well-rounded main cast, which facilitates character attachment. For examples sake, I\u2019ll highlight two characters in the story, first is the most important one, Saki, the narrator. The story is told in her perspective as an adult\u2014boy does she have a beautiful voice\u2014and she remains the central perspective throughout the anime. There\u2019s no reason to dislike her, she isn\u2019t overtly shy, nor is she stupidly outgoing; she best be described as \u201cbalanced\u201d. This doesn\u2019t mean that there\u2019s not reasons to like her though. Saki is curious, and compassionate, she\u2019s not remarkably intelligent, but she is undoubtedly smart and capable of independence. Faced with various obstacles, she manages to display vulnerability, without appearing pathetic. \\n\\n\r\nSatoru is a unique case though, a few times he comes to questionable conclusions regarding morality. His decision making process and bold statements come off as odd to the audience, and although he undoubtedly talented and book-smart, he often times has controversial opinions. What\u2019s crucial about his character to the story, is that he demonstrates how easy it is to be limited by perspective. Throughout multiple events, he makes subtle developments in character that can be seen through his opinions, and is perhaps one of the most growing characters in the story. \\n\\n\r\nI found the animation above satisfactory in color, movement, and character design. There were definitely times the animation had significant quality declines\u2014specifically one or two episodes\u2014and at times certain events the animations became inconsistent. The animation utilized bold colors, to create an atmosphere that emitted tension and combined with sound to create fitting tones, and dramatic scenes. Bone-chilling OSTS played during climatic moments keeping viewers on edge at all times. The ED song \u201cWareta Ringo\u201d is one of my favorites, definitely worth not skipping, especially because the animation is worth watching too. \\n\\n\r\nShinsekai Yori doesn\u2019t overwhelm viewers with overly complex themes, instead the anime introduces simple ambiguous concepts, and highlights human hypocrisies. Watching Shinsekai Yori is a cinematic experience, you\u2019ll find yourself completely immersed in the plot, and even when it\u2019s over the anime will resonate with you. It\u2019s been a few years since I\u2019ve last watched the anime, but it\u2019s still my favorite anime to date. Thanks for reading this review! \\n",

            "content": "In this world, we often have to question ourselves \"Is this TRULY the right thing to do?\" What is right or wrong, who makes those rules?\r\nIn Shinsekai Yori, five kids will try to seek the truth of their Utopian community. \r\nStory: Shinsekai Yori's strong point is the strong and powerful plot that keeps growing after each episode. The first few episodes you watch will give you the impression that the show is only about the adolescence of 5 kids. Before you know it, a more serious and dark plot will start to unveil itself as you watch. Without a doubt, Shinsekai Yori's intriguing and uniqueplot deserves a lot of praise and will surprise you along the way.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The first few episodes will have pretty normal art, one that isn't exactly bad yet not extremely beautiful either. I do remember however, there was one episode where the art was completely messed up. Other than that, in my opinion, as the story went on, the art changed. For better or for worse, I think that it really matched the mood and setting of the story.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Shinsekai Yori never really had a real opening, but it's first ending was extremely well done. In fact, it was one of my favorite song of Fall 2012 anime songs. The second ending was not bad as well, but just not as good as the first one. There was one OST that played throughout the beginning of the episodes that I really liked. It gave a kinda creepy mood and matched the story.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Saki's character development throughout the show was amazing. Slowly discovering the truth of the world and adapting to it. I thought her character was well portrayed. Each and every character had an important role that they played in the story. Yakomaru aka \"Squealer\", was a significant character as well. Without revealing too much, I'll say that his character is much more than who you'll think he is. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This easily became my favorite anime of Fall 2012. The surprises, the heartbreaking moments, and the final truth all contribute to make what this anime is. I would look forward to watching this every week. I truly amazing anime in my eyes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: What more do I need to say? The truth that lies within this story will be one that not only chills you to the bone, but will also cause you to question yourself the truth of this world. This is the story of 5 kids \"From the New World\".",

Also english isn't my natal language so be patient, and try to get the idea of my review if you can. I will procced to review this incredible masterpiece of anime.\r\nIn some seasons there are animes that are blessed with the gift of attention, but there are those incredible ones that get eclipsed by their brothers glory (even if its an obnoxious ecchi/moe show). This is one of those hidden gems. \r\nStory (10):\r\nWhat can I say about the story? Its just plain amazing, and evenin the first chapters when the action and suspense isn't that heavy, it makes you totally interested in the show and the characters. I don't wanna give spoilers, but if you are one of those thoughtful guys that loves deep stuff, plot twists and phylosophical inner struggles, then sir, you have found what you've been looking for.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9):\\n\r\nThe art here is very smooth but also easy-to-watch. It suits perfect to the characters and the show in general terms. Very peaceful and chill style.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10):\\n\r\nSince the first episode, \"Kage no Denshouka Daiichibu\" has been the soundtrack of all my emotions through the development of the story.\\n\r\nBut ALL the OST is amazing, it has that mystical and ancient feeling, although the story has place in an \"utopic\" future. Totally recommended.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10):\\n\r\nOk, if you are a intolerant homophobic, in Episode 8 you're probably going to dropped your ass out of this show. But please, don't be like that. The characters are one of the best that I've ever seen. They triggered in me a very high grade of empaty, a thing that very few series in my life truly accomplished to do. *KINDA SPOILER* Satoru and Saki are just great, just perfect for each other, and also both have a high sense of strategy, decision taking and logical resolution.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10):\\n\r\nIf you like anime, and you haven't watched this show, watch it.\\n\r\nIt doesn't matter what genres are you into, this has everything in it,\\n\r\nbut in an amalgam that will leave you totally satisfied, but also with a \\n\r\nfeeling of disconfort (in a social and moral way). \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "*SPOILER FREE REVIEW*\r\nI wanted to like this series. It's a dystopian mystery and starts off very strong. I particularly enjoy the theme song \u2013 it sets the atmosphere for the story. The first several episodes have a haunting feel, and the premise is unlike any other I've seen. Characters' personalities aren't anything special \u2013 but something I can overlook as long as they're given a bit more depth as the series progresses. I enjoyed most of the first arc, and the world building was well-developed and had much potential. My only issue with it was the whole mystery thing was entirely revealed too early on.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, it was in the second and third arcs where I felt let down. The haunting atmosphere I very much enjoyed had completely vanished, and the main character became annoyingly clingy. Due to the time skip, developments happen off-screen and it makes relationships formed between certain characters feel completely out-of-nowhere and jarring. In an episode in the 2nd arc where the main love interest is thrown into a depressing situation, the affected protagonist was just a pain in the ass. The episode itself brought out a wonderful surreal atmosphere, but the way she acted, along with her whining and clinginess just ruined it. \\n\\n\r\nThe third arc felt weird for me. The queerats, an aspect that has been kept as a side story, abruptly shifts to the main focus of the story. Nothing particularly wrong with that, but the complete lack of transition just made it feel out of place (Some argue that it felt completely natural to them, so it may not pose an issue for you if you haven't watched it yet). Again, because of the time skip, off-screen developments between characters happen and the audience is expected to be convinced by it. The whole arc felt boring and anti-climatic, except for the time when the main characters were escaping from the unidentified villain. That was one of the better points of the series. \\n\\n\r\nThe sense of fear of the unknown was very well-conveyed. The resolution part where the main character reflects on humanity's actions was also very nicely done. Most of everything else in the arc, in contrast, was kinda meh.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of potential, with the buildup and fear of the unknown solidly done. However, the revealed truths are disappointing and disproportionate compared to the heavily emphasised buildup (which resulted in many unmet expectations). Leaves much to be desired.",

            "content": "Shin Sekai Yori is an anime based on a novel written by Kishi Yusuke. The anime adaptation was handled by A-1 pictures. You may remember them as the studio behind Kuroshitsuji and AnoHana. This was actually requested as a \u201cfuturistic scenario done right\u201d after I took a look at the mediocrity that was Blue Gender, but I've also been told that this series is just as bad, even using several of the same cliches. There's only one way to find out which is more correct and that's by taking a look. \r\nStory:\r\nOur tale opens in the far future. Our protagonist, Saki, has just advanced tothe next level of education, a school that teaches kids how to use their psychic abilities, but there's something wrong. Students disappear from the school and are promptly forgotten. Saki and her friends go on a camping trip that will lead to them learning a great secret about their society.\\n\\n\r\nThat's how the first arc begins. Yes, the series has multiple story arcs. One thing the series does really well is introducing intriguing ideas. The problem is that most of those concepts end up going absolutely nowhere or are just executed poorly. You think that the various ideas that are touched upon are going to eventually have a point, but they never do. It's like Kishi introduced them planning to integrate them into the plot eventually, but couldn't figure out how and let them drop, or briefly mentioned them in some minor scene in the hopes that he could validate having them in the first place. \\n\\n\r\nThere are quite a few other issues with the execution of this anime. The series tries to explain several facets of its world with science, which it gets wrong consistently. To use an early example that won't spoil anything, the series talks about bonobos. It says that they're peaceful, preferring sex to conflict and that they'll only engage in sexual activities with the same sex when they're young. The first half is true, the second is an outright lie and the bad part is that a half-true scientific statement is about the best the series ever gets in terms of its science. \\n\\n\r\nThe crowning moment of stupidity is definitely the ending. It starts by using a huge logical fallacy in the major climax. Then it segues into a plot twist that hinges on bad science and just to make things even worse, the series ends with the same lazy, stupid, clich\u00e9 that Blue Gender ended with. Except that the execution is even worse. At least Blue Gender had some build up going into it, Shin Sekai Yori has a five minute montage at the very end to justify resorting to this tripe. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are similar to the story. The writing teases you with hints that these characters are going to develop and get fleshed out, but then it never delivers. In spite of the story spanning over a decade, the characters never grow or develop. They remain pretty stagnant throughout. \\n\\n\r\nThe only attempts to demonstrate growth for the characters are done with informed characteristics. For example, there's a character who talks about Saki's great leadership skills but she never demonstrates any leadership abilities whatsoever. She follows other people's plans or gets told what to do by the voices in her head. Yes, she has deceased people talk to her. No, this is never explained it's just used as a deus ex machina device. \\n\r\nThe issue with informed characteristics like this is that the audience isn't going to believe them. You can tell us the stormtroopers are precise marksmen, but if we see them miss virtually ever shot we aren't going to believe it. Likewise, you can tell us she's a great leader. You could also tell us she gained magical girl powers from a talking dog and saved the world from goo monsters during one of the time skips or that she's the world's greatest detective. We not only aren't going to buy it, but we aren't going to care unless you actually demonstrate it within the narrative. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art is really good. Everything is nicely detailed and the character designs are nicely done. That being said, there is one problem with the art. The action sequences are drawn very oddly and they can be difficult to follow. Especially the early ones. For the sake of argument, let's say that this was done to provide a sense of chaos and make things seem hectic. That would be fine, but it still doesn't flow well or look good. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nI have no complaints about the voice acting. Every actor gives a capable performance, in spite of not having much to work with. Hanazawa Kana (Akane from Psycho Pass) and Hirata Hiroaki (Benny from Black Lagoon) are particularly good. The music is largely forgettable, but not bad. \\n\\n\r\nHo-Yay:\\n\\n\r\nThe ho-yay factor is going to be a 4/10. The series has a bit early on. It has some yaoi between Shun and Satoru, as well as some in the background, and some yuri between Saki and Maria, plus some more in the background. Then it transitions into having nothing but het. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts: \\n\\n\r\nOn the positive side, Shin Sekai Yori has strong art and good voice acting. Unfortunately, the writing is just inept. The story suffers from major plot holes, terrible science, dropped plot aspects, a horrendous ending and characters who are less interesting than the random nameless bad guys you fight in a Fire Emblem game. As a result, the narrative is just terrible and I would not suggest sitting through it just for the art and acting. My final rating is going to be a 3/10. Next week, One Outs.",

This anime is an adaptation of a sci-fi novel set in a distant future where humans have acquired telekinetic capabilities. This new world seems almost utopian at first, but something doesn\u2019t feel quite right. That unsettling feeling is shared by a group of five childhood friends, whose adventures form the core of the storyline. What makes Shinsekai Yori special is that it addresses disturbing themes while also providing an entertaining tale of battle and mystery.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\r\nThe story is extremely well crafted, as you would expect from something based on a novel. At first, it bears similarities to A Brave New World and The Hunger Games, but it gets completely different in unpredictable ways. The world the children live in holds many secrets, and you won\u2019t get to the bottom of the mystery until the very end. The first part of the series focuses on the relationships between the characters. Then the story picks up, and we understand that what is happening is on a much larger scale. Everything is successfully wrapped up with purpose and sense in the end.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\r\nYou get five different characters, well fleshed out, and each of them undergo stellar character development. Saki makes an ideal protagonist because she is level-headed and has good judgment. She takes action when she needs to. Then you have a gifted boy, an intrepid one, a caring girl and a sensitive boy, which might sound clich\u00e9, but all of them are memorable. All I can say without spoiling is that they are brave and smart, looking out for each other. Indeed, what really shines is the relationship between them.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nI think the music is excellent. I can still hear the sunset tune in my head. It is hauntingly beautiful and creates the perfect atmosphere. The songs are a little repetitive, but very fitting to the overly controlled society, giving it a bit of an artificial feel. The voice acting is impressive too, especially considering the characters age throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nBeautiful art and fluid animation. You\u2019ll find spectacular scenery, lovely character design, creative clothing, interesting backgrounds, soft colors, but beware of super ugly creatures. I think art and music work together wonderfully to create powerful atmospheres, most of the time somewhat scary. It is, afterall, a dystopian universe, so even the enchanting landscapes hide a sour truth.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nAlthough the anime did great in every other aspect, I felt the pacing was uneven. Some parts felt like they had been stretched too much, while other episodes were packed with events. That being said, it felt like the anime went through a variety of genres, from slice of life to action to horror. Accordingly, it made me go through many emotions, including disgust, sadness and fear. I thoroughly enjoyed the second half of the series because the conflict takes epic proportions.\\n\\n\r\nI found this anime smart, unpredictable and moving. Koodos to the creators for staying clear of overused anime formulas. They didn\u2019t talk down to the viewers by explaining everything through dialogue and they actually made good use of flashbacks. I highly recommend to watch this anime till the end. It might not be for everyone, because it is serious and weird, but it is definitely an original piece of work that will have you reflect on various social themes.",

            "content": "Shinsekai Yori as an adaptation of a novel is terrific.  Many adaptations tend to skip over significant amount of background information presented in the original source but not Shinsekai Yori.  The plot stays true to the original source and it manages to provide a great amount of background information regarding the events that led to the dystopian place the anime is set in.  But just as in the original source the plot suffers greatly due to its unsatisfactory resolution to many of the intriguing mysteries that were presented in the beginning.  What begins as a captivating story of as village youngteenagers uncovering the hidden motives of their governing body ends with a cliche \"creations turning against the creator\" plot.  It suffers from an identity conflict.  It doesn't really know what it wants to be or rather wants to be encompass many themes but fails to pull it off.  The issues raised in the first few episodes are quickly resolved half way through in the series with disappointing conclusions that were either predictable or illogical.  Many time the series builds up a fascinating mystery which leaves the viewer pondering but the climax and \"the moment of truth\" for many of these mysteries are rushed and unsatisfactory.  Every mystery comes to a sudden end instead of a long and fulfilling conclusion.  \\n\\n\r\nThe second half of the series turns into a more action-oriented character driven story.  Its about the revolt of creations against their creator.  Although this is not clear until the last ten minutes of the show.  It reveals a very cruicial plot point regarding the origns of the \"creations\" but it is revealed in an extremely rushed fashion.  The actions that were presented in the second half of the series were terribly choreographed.  The characters use their cantus power which is similar to telekinesis but utlizied in a brutal way.  Out of nowhere heads are exploded, people are cut into hallf and explosions occur in the city using these invisible power.  It is difficult to grasp what is going on during these action scenes.  Many powerful leaders of the village are simply cut down by the fiend, an individual whcih uses its power of hate to greatly amplify his/her powers.  The fiends are extremely powerful and the explanation associated with the reasoning of their immense power is rather nonsensical and illogical.  Many concepts introduced in the series are not explored thoroughly.  One of these concept is the \"death of shame\" which is an alteration to the genes of human beings to prevent them from killing another.  This concept is used as a Deus Ex Machina. This concept is used as a measure to put an end to the main threat of the series.   But its execution is from perfect.  While the concept was introduced early in the series, its application toward the end series comes out of nowhere.  The second half of the series is simply a mess when it comes to story telling.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters are usually well done even if they are a bit melodramatic.  This mostly applies to the main character of the series.  The side characters are well written.  Interaction between the characters is very natural and human.  There are no long philosophical dialouges.  Conversations are very human and natural.  The production values of the series is decent.  The art is terrific and uses a wide range of colors but the animation is inconsistent.  The fighting animations in particular are off-putting.  The character art is very simple.  Faces lack detail and features.  Its difficult for the characters to convey emotions which such simple face features.  The voice acting is well done.  VAs  both in english and japanese are comfortable with their roles and sound very natural.  The music is generally good but not memorable.  I can't think of any tracks which I want to go back and listen to.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall Shinsekai Yori is a decent series which suffers from the same problems of the original source.  The adaptation is great but the plot leaves a lot to be desired.  I recommend this anime to anyone who wants to enjoy a unique dystopian anime.  \\n\\n\r\nScore : 3.5/5",

            "content": "Note: it\u2019s been quite some time since I actually saw this anime so bear with me with this one, but my feelings towards it have always been quite specific and have never changed so hopefully it\u2019ll work out. This will be done from a mostly critical perspective for once as those are the emotions that stand out the most for me, but please don\u2019t misinterpret this as me hating the show, because that is definitely not the case. Feedback\u2019s always appreciated.\r\nShinsekai Yori is a show that falls into the category of \u201cmisused potential\u201d. It is a series that could, and perhaps should have been oneof the best anime in quite some time, but it rather frustratingly stumbles and trips upon itself for completely unnecessary reasons.\\n\\n\r\nIf you take a look at this show from the outside in a general sense, then you\u2019re almost guaranteed to be looking at a masterpiece. The beautiful setting, the original concept along with its darker undertones and the actual sense of realism itself is enough to leave anyone in awe. However if you take a step closer and crack open the shell in order to take a look at the creamy filling of the show, what you\u2019re going to find is sadly not as flawless as first impressions might have made it seem.\\n\\n\r\nShinsekai Yori (henceforth abbreviated as SSY) is what I would like to call an ambitious experiment in anime. It is a series that tries to go above and beyond the normal limitations in order to stand out from the crowd. SSY tries to do so much at the same time, and in all honesty succeeds with that fairly well; however it does so at the price of forgetting some of the very basics of what makes an anime great in the first place.\\n\\n\r\n-- Story \u2013 9/10 --\\n\r\nStarting with the good parts though, SSY has a rather unique take on how to lead a story onwards. Rather than focusing on its characters directly or even some sort of object or location being the center of attention, SSY\u2019s story is about the world itself. What is this world? How did it end up the way it did, and why? What does the future have in store for it and its inhabitants? How does humanity manage to co-exist with the other intelligent life forms in this world? These are the kind of questions that the story tackles which deviates from the normal a bit, and it does so in a quite interesting and captivating way, as there are a lot of questions to be answered on the grander scale. It also deals with issues such as diplomacy, politics and simply management of a faction in itself.\\n\\n\r\nFrom a purely objective standpoint, this is all fine and dandy and all, however it also comes at a price\u2026\\n\\n\r\n-- Characters \u2013 5/10 --\\n\r\n\u2026and that is the complete lack of character development. Focusing on the story of the world rather than the story of the characters is interesting and all, but in the end what it did above all was render the main cast of the show into a group of people that would have been better placed as background characters rather than on the front lines.\\n\\n\r\nWell okay; to revise my initial statement, there *is* character development in this show, a fair bit of it actually, however effectively the entire MC cast of the show is so ridiculously bland and boring from the very start that no matter what kind of dramatic, perilous or supposedly tragic situation they ended up in, I simply couldn\u2019t help but not care about what happened to them. After all, even if someone would end up spontaneously killed along the way, if you don\u2019t even have an opinion about the person in question in the first place, the intended emotional impact just misses its mark. It was most likely that the first thought to come to my mind at such a time would be \u201cgood riddance\u201d more than anything.\\n\\n\r\n-- Art \u2013 7/10 --\\n\r\nNow this part sends me some quite conflicting signals to be honest. The world of SSY is quite simply beautiful. The vast natural environments and locations which feel like they could have been taken straight out of some MMORPG all have a feeling of reality to them, and it was the kind of setting where you\u2019d like to have a world map available at all times and keep exploring what else it had to offer.\\n\\n\r\nAt the same time however, the actual animations themselves are in all honesty extremely average if you take the fact that this anime came out during the winter of 2012/2013 into account. Above all though, the actual attention to detail regarding the characters\u2019 facial expressions and similar is just simply awkward most of the time, almost as if they were intentionally adding insult to injury for what was already by far the biggest weakness of the show.\\n\\n\r\n-- Sound \u2013 8/10 --\\n\r\nSSY uses mainly atmospheric background music for its BGM which fits very well for the theme of the show, and it was a very good OST in general I\u2019d say. There is no one track that stands out though, perhaps with the exception of the ED which was interestingly enough a rehashed version of \u201cGoing Home\u201d from Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s Symphony No. 9.\\n\\n\r\nThe seiyuu cast has some heavy-hitter names in it, which you might argue is a bit sad since their performances had to be wasted on such boring characters, but on the other hand it\u2019d have been even worse without them. Hanazawa Kana stands out from the crowd (as usual you could say) and really tries to bring life to the role she has, but even so a human being can only do so much when you have so little to work with in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the opening theme of the show\u2026 it quite simply: Does. Not. Exist.\\n\r\nNow, I can\u2019t help but ask, was there any reason not to have one? I mean I usually skip the opening of an anime once I\u2019ve heard it once or twice (unless it\u2019s really damn good), but even so was there any actual point of not even having one? Well whatever\u2026\\n\\n\r\n-- Enjoyment \u2013 8/10 --\\n\r\nThis category is in all honesty really hard to rate and/or comment on. Why? Because SSY does not really feel like an anime to me. Now that can be either a good thing or a bad thing, but the fact of the matter is that it feels more like a documentary mixed together with a historical textbook rather than a show meant for actual entertainment. There are neither any charismatic characters nor any real plot development of the sort that will get your adrenaline running. It is a quite slow story about a utopian world, and spanning a vast timespan while doing so. It gave me the feeling that it was a concept intended to leave you in awe rather than being meant to entertain the viewers, however if it\u2019s not directly entertaining, it won\u2019t leave you in awe in the first place, so it has its own little paradox to work with.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said though, SSY still manages to tease your sense of curiosity concerning what is actually going on behind the scenes of this world, and for that alone I found it pretty interesting so marathoning it over at least not too many sessions wasn\u2019t that bad.\\n\\n\r\n-- Overall \u2013 8/10 --\\n\r\nShinsekai Yori is what I would like to call a blueprint. A theory yet to be perfected about what you can do when you start thinking outside the box. It is a blueprint where all kinds of ideas were added on constantly while its creators were chuckling maniacally to themselves at their own geniuses. However when the invention was all said and done, they suddenly realized that they had forgotten some crucial nuts and bolts in their contraption\u2019s very core; something that was now out of reach and could never be fixed.\\n\\n\r\nIt is a classic case of \u201cwhat could have been\u201d. SSY leaves me rather annoyed with itself because, while it still in the end was a very good show, it could, and in my opinion, *should* have been so much more. While I don\u2019t think it could ever have reached the top 20 of the MAL rankings as some people seem to claim it should, I\u2019m quite sure it would\u2019ve been top 50 at least if the production hadn\u2019t been so damn sloppy with its very basics.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said though, these kind of experiments need to exist, because humans learn from their mistakes, and maybe next time the 2.0 version of the blueprint will have been patched up and the next true masterpiece will be born.\\n\\n\r\nAll we can do is cross our fingers and hope.",

            "content": "This will be my review for 'Shinsekai Yori' (SSY for short). I want to start by making a few statements to give you an idea of where I am coming from. First, I finished this anime within 24 hours of this review. I was told that this show was unlike any other and that the ending is outstanding. Lastly, I hate this anime with a deep passion, but I think this is an incredible anime without a doubt. Now I will try to convey my feelings towards this show and why I don't think it deserves the right to be called anything near a \"masterpiece\".This review will include minor spoilers. \\n\\n\r\nPrelude - 10 (Outstanding)\\n\\n\r\nThe setting SSY takes place in is Japan 1000 years from the time that we live in, so roughly assuming it takes place in 3000AD, but it doesn't look like what most people would expect. Small villages, no technology, a lot of greenery, and the people live off the land. There is only one twist, the people of that time are able to use a type of telekinesis they refer to as 'Cantus', which they learn to begin to master at a very young age. Those who can not keep up with the teaching of school, or break the \"Code of Ethics\" they disappear from school. They learn while young that the world outside away from the villages is a very dangerous and when the 5 protagonists venture out too far from the village everything goes downhill from there. \"What are humans?\" \"What are fiends\" \"What are Karma Demons\" \"What happen to the kids who leave the school.\" \"Why can't I remember?\" All questions that the 5 young protagonists start to ask themselves. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 10 (Outstanding)\\n\\n\r\nSSY does an incredible job when it comes to the animation, the way each character is drawn is remarkable and beautifully done as they tend to stick to natural hair colors. The scenery is great, the rivers and trees all give off the proper atmosphere of how they live in their small villages and how every day life is handled. SSY has done an incredible job, I'll say it again, with the art. I look forward to new series with the same art style.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10 (Outstanding)\\n\\n\r\nJust as the art SSY did a fantastic job with the sound, the opening music played at the beginning of each episode was a soothing start to any episode, it never failed my expectations when it came to this. I am truly impressed by the sound.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 7 (Good)\\n\\n\r\nNow, this is a very tough subject for me. The lead Saki is a fantastic but not perfect character, she's just an average girl that wants to know the truth. She gets scared easily, but always is able to snap out of it and keep moving forward. Shun is a great \"older brother\" type character that seems to take care of the group in general, Satoru is your general goofball that grows up into an incredible man who is willing to protect his friends with his life. Maria as the supporting character to mainly Saki and the 'weak link' of the group Mamoru who is typically the only one who thinks rationally about the consequences of their actions. It's a great cast but as the story progresses the importance of some of these characters seem to fade to the sidelines near the end.  Which deeply saddens me.\\n\\n\r\nDevelopment of the Plot - 6 (Fair)\\n\\n\r\nI had problems with the development of the story. They occasionally, from time to time, repeated facts that were stated before. Now, this is sometimes due to the circumstances of the protagonists as to sometimes they lose their memories, but these 'reminders' take a bit too long. Not to mention the actions of one of the protagonists and what he/she has gone through doesn't even matter in the long run. In the end he/she is only used to give us a physical example of knowledge we already had, once again that doesn't matter in the overall plot. Now, I am not saying that the overall and final plot of SSY was horrible or even bad. I am talking about the development, I watched this series in roughly 4 days and often found myself saying \"I know this already\" as the show wasted 12 minutes to flashback to an example. \\n\\n\r\nStory - 7 (Good)\\n\\n\r\nNow, majority of what we learned the previous 17 episodes was simply information to understand this world. The final plot takes bits and pieces of the information we have learned and creates a great finale that I myself didn't expect from this show. It gives you the most unexpected finale that will make you watch the last 8 episodes without moving. \\n\r\nThis was a great way to end the anime, but was it the best way? \\n\r\nLets talk about this below.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 6 (Fair)\\n\\n\r\n I have a wide range of genres when it comes to anime. I might give a show like Yuru Yuri a 9 and give Ergo Proxy a 9 (Hypothetically) but does that mean they were equal in terms of quality? In their genre yes! Probably so. I try to ask myself a question while watching a series \"What is the author trying to show me?\" Does he want to make me laugh, does he want me to understand how valuable family is, does he want me to ponder the way I've lived my life? What did he want to tell me by showing me these 25 episodes of this anime? And I had a very had time figuring it out while watching SSY, and I came to a conclusion. One that made sense considering the development of the plot and the resolution, and what I think the author was trying to say is \"Survive, no matter how tough life gets Survive there is an end to your suffering\" With the way the plot develops the trauma the protagonists go through and all the hardships, even though the story seems to repeat information, \"Survive\" remains a realistic reason to the entire story. \"Saki, Shun, Satoru, Maria, Mamoru, YOU. Survive, there is an end to your suffering.\" \\n\\n\r\nOverall -  8 (Very Good)\\n\\n\r\nI believe personally, that this show is far from being a masterpiece like the other reviews, but I will not hesitate to recommend this series to every single person that shares any type of interest in Anime. Regardless of the score you give it, although I can't personally being rated lower than a 6, I am sure that everyone could say \"I don't regret watching SSY.\" \"SSY was a great anime.\" \"I'd rewatch this series.\"\\n\\n\r\nThanks for taking the time to read this review. \"Survive\"",

            "content": "Well to start things off let me just get one thing off my chest\u2026.. DAMN UTOPIAS YOU SCARY( cant we have one that works for once?). Now that that is out of the way; the review.  The dystopian sub-genera of science fiction is not anything new. We\u2019ve had literature, Hollywood, and even other anime do it. It generally presents on the surface a \u201cperfect\u201d society, with no bloodshed and all inhabitants with apparent happiness. Then what we discover about the society is much more sinister. Shinsekai Yori is no different in that regard. Yet, it does have things that make it stand out amongstother shows of similar type. One, the society itself is very interesting and unique in its organization. Its \u201cmethods\u201d are different that most other dystopian shows. Let me explain, the society of Shinsekai Yori is a society of psychics a millennia in our future. Which has come into being from reasons that will be revealed (No spoilers).  Why it came together though is a different matter. It was in order to preserver absolute peace. This because psychic\u2019s, even kids can kill tons of other people with a mere thought.  This is the reason for this society, its in order to protect them, form themselves. Certain \u201cmethods\u201d are used in the show. Which you and the characters will slowly figure out. These \u201cthings\u201d are done in order to preserve this peace. What is interesting is that the people doing the \u201cmethods\u201d really do not wish to do them. This is different than most others in this genre. There is simply irrefutable logic on what they do based on the past experiences of the Psychic race. They simply are afraid, and must do \u201cthings\u201d to preserve the now 60,000 people living in Japan. Shinsekai Yori is known for its amazing world building. You will learn all the reasons for the society and the uniquely organized world they live in. In appearance it looks and feels like one giant Buddhist temple town. The plot is organized to build the world and set the tone (which is creepy and mysterious mostly); the plot truly is to build the world. It\u2019s the discovery of each truth through our characters that you also discover with them. This is what makes the show. You will be shown, what is in my opinion one of the most disturbing dystopias ever. What makes it so disturbing, is its brutality, and its general irrefutable reasoning behind the \u201cmethods\u201d. You wish to argue against it, but simply cannot from what you learn about the past. With a plot to build one of the most complete, interestingly toned, and well presented worlds in modern media, Shinsekai Yori receives a very high (10/10) for story.\\n\\n\\n\r\n\tAnimation was handled by A-1 pictures. Shinsekai Yori is by no means is a perfect show. It had a low budget for a modern anime, and this low budget shows at multiple times.  The details on animation where not complete, backgrounds were plain, especially when nothing with regards to action was happening.  I am not going to lie it made me cringe at times.  It has a redeeming factor, they saved portions of its budget for the most important fights and surreal moments. Shinsekai Yori uses very stylized visuals which I personally loved. Its stylized art does sometimes show the flaws of animation much more clearly. The show also has large amounts surreal moments which are where a good portions of the budget was used( I mean a Psychic Dystopia\u2026 not going to be a mind F*** at all). Overall the good and bad kind of cancel out in animation with a final score of \u2026 (7/10)\\n\\n\r\n\tThe sound I\u2019m going to say right up front is divine. Composition was handled by Motoyama, Satoshi.  He handled nothing really of note before this show. His sound direction though was spot on. He used Choirs of children along side haunting melodies which set the tone perfectly. My Ost Choice in the Main theme:  Kage No Denshouka Daiichibu; which is a choir of children signing hauntingly with slow drums and guitar in the background. It sounds like a haunting melody of the world which we are shown.  Where it\u2019s hurt slightly on Osts is in general volume; most amines have about 2 hours of songs. Shinsekai Yori on the other hand has about 40 min of songs for 25 episode series. Albeit they are gorgeous, but it is still is a problem as they repeat allot. The show also does not have openings, only ending themes.  Both of which are great and a good tune for the end of each episode. I personally like the second ending better. With a haunting sound track of quality over quantity that sets the mood for this unique world.  Shinsekai Yori receives for sound: (9/10) \\n\\n\r\n\tPossibly where the show is hit hardest is its characters. Which generally are flat and don\u2019t really have a stand out. This true amongst the humans.  The Rat Monster tribes (species subservient to humans) do have a couple semi-interesting individuals. Squealer, and Kirormaru are leaders of two large tribes.  Both of which have their own agendas.  The Humans though are flat and do not stand out much. There are some great moments, but the basic personality of the main cast kills the mood at times. For a story with a large amount of growing up themes, it hurts it.  This lack of good standout character hinders it from being truly a masterpiece beyond words. (7/10) (Did I mention the entire society is Bisexual with a reason? There are some Yuri and Yaoi parings, so here is a warning)\\n\\n\r\n\tShinsekai Yori is a mind bending, stylized adventure, with an amazing world containing well thought out reasons and lore. It\u2019s hurt by flat characters, which are neither bad nor well represented.  Its low budget is also shown in the number of songs, and the lack of general detail in its art at many points. Yet, for its plot Shinsekai Yori is an anime that should not be missed, especially if you enjoy psychological and dramatic shows. It\u2019s a dystopian world of unknown horror and wonder that will shock you to your core. This truly is the highlight of the show and has made it one of my favorite anime of all time, despite its obvious flaws. Shinsekai Yori receives and overall of (8.85/10)\\n",

            "content": "Plot:\r\nThe main thing this anime has going for it, and the reason why it is so critically acclaimed, is the content. It deals with very heavy topics in a uniquely dystopian future, taking a new spin on the post-apocalyptic genre. In terms of content and subject matter, this anime deserves perfect marks; no matter how badly it was screwed up for other reasons, I cannot rate the story any lower than an 8. However, it was very flawed in execution. The story progressed slowly and unevenly, with too many tangents to flow properly. I found myself tuning out at several different points, and only keptwatching for completion's sake, before the storytelling became fluid enough to pique my interest again. Perhaps the gravest mistake was in the execution of the last few episodes. What makes this anime so great is the dark history and hidden truth behind the world that it takes place in. It's the revelation of bits and pieces of this along the way that drives the experience. Towards the end, however, these bits of information stop coming. The anime begins to focus entirely on the action, losing itself in the process. It is not until AFTER the story arc ends that the last epic revelation takes place, and this is a horrible sin. Score: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThere was nothing special about the art in this anime. It was not bad, but it wasn't above average. There was awkward CGI in some places that stood out as an eyesore, which is what I'd expect from an average anime. Score: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nAgain, there was nothing special about the soundtrack. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't above average. Score: 5/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nI have to say that the character development in this anime is among the weirdest I've seen, in particular with regards to romance. Aside from the strangeness, it was underwhelming. Score: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nAs I said in the plot part of my review, I found myself frequently losing interest and had to force myself to watch some sections of the anime. It wasn't a terrible experience overall, but I didn't enjoy it any more than I'd expect from an average anime. Score: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI would like to state that I do not think this anime does not deserve its critical acclaim. The content absolutely merits praise and respect. As a story, this anime is among the greatest. However, as an anime, this anime isn't anything special. Score: 6/10",

            "content": "Well, Shinsekai Yori for me is great anime! One of the best I've seen! However this anime might not be for everyone as there are a lot of concepts to understand and get the gist of which makes this quite a mature anime. For this anime, it required A LOT of patience so I wasn't exactly very fond of this anime. But in the end, it was definitely worth it. So if you want to try and give this anime a chance, try to watch it up to episode 4 as it's a pretty slow start at the beginning. What I like about this animeis that it's very realistic and gives you a lot to think about, there are absolutely no cliche bits which is something that I see in a lot of anime but Shinsekai Yori doesn't. On the other hand... This anime doesn't give any thought for your feelings and reveals the harsh truth. (Like I said, this anime isn't exactly for everyone but I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it for mature audiences unlike myself. A 13 year old and my big brother was pretty surprised that I understood and liked it)",

            "content": "*to those who are too lazy to read and just want a quick summary, skip to the final paragraph*\r\nWordy, confusing, dark, yet strangely compelling.  These are the words which perfectly describe the experience I had from watching this anime. Shinsekai Yori, or From The New World , is an anime adaptation of a visual novel of the same name. To tell you frankly, this review has taken quite some time to write, simply because I found it hard to put into words as to why it is good. Either way, I will still do my best to write this review, and to start offlet me provide you with a simple overview of the plot.\\n\\n\r\n Shisekai Yori is an anime set a millennium into the future, in a seemingly utopian society where the remaining humans have finally unlocked the power of mind over matter, which they refer to as Cantus. During a field trip, Saki, the main protagonist of the story, along with her four friends discovers an ancient recording device left behind by the past civilization. With the revelations they found, their adventure begins as they are captured by Queerats, another race of beings which resembles humanoid molerats.\\n\\n\r\nSo, what exactly is good with Shinsekai Yori? Well, to start off, let us discuss the plot. If you read the summary carefully, you might notice that it actually resembles an adventure type anime. However, that is not the case. Shinsekai Yori is a psychological anime that focuses on the philosophical aspects of the story (which I will be discussing later), despite the fact that it is tagged under horror, which I think it is not. Shinsekai Yori is an anime where you really have to put some time into it to enjoy it. The anime is quite slow; it only gets interesting at episode 3 and the plot only picks up at episode 9 or so. So yes, it does have quite a slow start, but once it gets rolling, it really hooks you in with its wonderfully executed and spontaneous plot. It\u2019s the type of anime where when things get serious, they really get serious, And just as you\u2019re breathing your first sigh of relief after the end of an intense plot arc, things kick into high gear again making it a thrill to watch until the very end.\\n\\n\r\nBut despite the plot being spontaneous, it was complicated enough to give off a sense of mystery. There are times when you just have no idea of what\u2019s happening until it hits you in the face. Personally, I found this to be quite refreshing: To not be able to tell what will happen next and just watch plot unfold and reveal the answers to your questions.\\n\\n\r\n Though even with all those things, the best thing about Shinsekai Yori\u2019s plot still lies in its philosophical undertones. It portrays to us in a serious manner sensitive topics such as racism, slavery, human sexuality, and even democracy. These philosophical undertones are what  makes Shinsekai Yori shine; It can make you think about the implications of those things in real life just like any decent and self-respecting Sci-fi title has. And what\u2019s more, it shows us circumstances where we can\u2019t help but feel pity to the oppressed and hate for the oppressors. Shinsekai Yori is the type of anime that makes the viewer empathize with the characters despite us viewers never having really been in that situation. This alone makes such a great anime, as it leaves a huge impact on whoever watches it, making it a memorable experience to all those who\u2019ve watched it.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, I\u2019d say that they are nothing less than wonderful. The main characters were truly unique and fleshed out, and had good personalities to boot. Now, what really made the characters so interesting is that you can see how they changed over time. You can see them turning from flat and boring characters into interesting people each with their own uniqueness in terms of their philosophies. Speaking of uniqueness, well the characters themselves weren\u2019t all too unique in a sense that they could possibly still be fitted into some character archetypes. Take Shun for example. He\u2019s the silent type who speaks only when needed and when he does, he speaks in an intelligent manner that you would expect from the seemingly smartest person in their group. Does that sound familiar to you? But despite that, the characters do change into unique characters as I\u2019ve mentioned before, and that\u2019s what counts.\\n\\n\r\nAnd also, I would like to give a special mention to the antagonist of this anime. As to not spoil the plot, I won\u2019t tell who it is but I for one think that he is one of the greatest antagonists ever created. Now, one of the things that really caught my attention about him was his personality. He was what you would call a trickster, the type of character who you have a very bad feeling about and yet he seems to be unlikely an enemy.  He made use of the protagonists and played them for fools, while being so seemingly friendly and down to earth which made him so interesting. Also, despite being the antagonist, the reason as to why he was fighting was very reasonable that at times I found myself even supporting him. It wasn\u2019t like in other anime where the antagonists are being asses for the sake of being an ass, in Shinsekai Yori the antagonist was being an ass for a very reasonable reason. Kind of like how Yagami was such an ass despite having good intentions.\\n\\n\r\nAnd to top it all off, Shinsekai Yori also has a pretty decent animation. It was animated by A1 pictures, which also animated SAO (which despite having a bad plot, you gotta admit it had great animation) as well as other famous anime as well like Magi, Fairy Tail, Kuroshitsuji II, and Ao no Exorcist. The music was also great. The BGMs were the type of foreboding music that sounds like people chanting and gives a wonderful atmosphere when needed. Also, the first ending song, Wareta Ringo, was just addicting and has been stuck in my head for a couple of weeks now. Sadly, they don\u2019t have an opening sequence, and just start off with something like a 30 sec recap of the last episode.\\n\\n\r\nNow one last thing, and this one is the thing that has sparked a bit of controversy among people (or at least, between me and my friends), and that is the presence of Yaoi and Yuri in the series. If you are the type of person who cannot handle seeing tongue action between two men, despite the fact that it isn\u2019t done for the sake of fanservice, or even better, girls kissing each other, well, watch it anyway. These things are not detrimental to the plot (though it was mentioned why this happens in the first three episodes if you read carefully) and therefore would not affect the overall experience of watching this anime.\\n\\n\r\nSo with all that said, what is the verdict for Shinsekai Yori? For me, I found it to be quite heck of a ride. The plot was well-written and executed, the undertones were mind boggling and the characters were a joy to watch. Despite that though, it is far from perfect and there are some bad in it like how it had a slow start, a complicated story, and Yaoi. Personally, I found it to be one of the more interesting anime of this past year. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a decent psychological anime that revolves more on philosophical themes rather than gore. \\n\\n\r\nTo provide a quick summary of this review, here are the pros and cons of this anime:\\n\\n\r\n+Plot was well-written, well executed and spontaneous.\\n\r\n+The philosophical undertones of the story were very interesting to say the least.\\n\r\n+The characters were fleshed out pretty well and the character development aspect of this anime was superb\\n\r\n+The antagonist was very noteworthy and had a great impact because of his goal.\\n\r\n+The animation and music were decent.\\n\r\n+Yuri  XD\\n\\n\r\n-The first few episodes had a slow start to the point that it seemed like nothing was happening\\n\r\n-The plot was hard to understand and pretty complicated at first.\\n\r\n-Some of the characters can be fitted into character archetypes.\\n\r\n-Yaoi (?)\\n\\n\r\n~First and foremost, thanks for reading my review.

            "content": "~ Is it not natural to want to escape such a fate? ~ \r\nThere are many things that the evolution of humanity can tell us.\r\nFrom the fact that power exists to be corrupted...\r\nTo the fact that war is a self-inflicted bitter end...\r\nTo watch Shinsekai yori means to have a vividly depicted world of secrecy and deception built up, and broken down before your eyes. In spite of the significant supernatural influence of the show, this \"New World\" is essentially a model of our own. It's a highly politically and morality engaged mystery series that exposes the tragedy behind a social infrastructure striving for power. Indeeda great deal more could be read into the way that humans are presented in Shinsekai, but I'm not here to ramble; i'm here to review.\\n\\n\r\n1000 years down the line, and yet: this is a very different reality to the one crammed down our throats by 90's Sci-Fi movies. Devoid of technology, and instead solving our problems with telekinetic-like powers: Shinsekai takes place in a notably disconnected and eerie feeling village. Ridden with mystery, and plagued by a dark history of covert operations: we're certainly oblivious to everything initially, and this is what really invokes curiosity. Not in the cheap confusion-tactic way either: as it's a genuinely thought-provoking, one-of-a-kind initiation. From the first episode, the subtle integration of supernatural elements, set the tone well for the journey to come. While the myths and mystery elements added a tasteful sense of darkness; pertaining to the fact that some form of escalation or \"happening\" was imminent.\\n\\n\r\nEnticed by the mysterious setting; I had to delve deeper...\\n\\n\r\nIt is a powerful and thorough documentation of a dark and morally questionable history.\\n\r\nA history of deception. A history of oppression. A history of conflict. A reflection of our thirst for power, and our \"perfect\" society. In essence, Shinsekai yori is nothing less than the animated representation of the renowned \"War and Peace\" article. While a little slow to begin, the story meticulously detailed. And while initializing with nothing more than a nagging sense of injustice, this story line evolves and blossoms into life beautifully. From an awkward \"bud\" to rose of the deepest crimson red: Shinsekai yori is a highly philosophical, eye-opening, and yet gripping tale of evolution itself. Its difficult to comprehend even the scale of its implications.\\n\\n\r\nWhile a little reliant of the viewer's ability to pay attention, it's not a preachy story, made with the aim to confuse; as it would never sacrifice the clarity of the overriding message. If it's even possible, the story makes even the grayest lines of morality: clear as day. \\n\\n\r\nNow I know what you're thinking: \"How can something you described as \"philosophical\" engage me at all? (sounds boring)\".\\n\r\nWell, not that I can believe it myself really either, but Shinsekai manages to create a perfect harmony of intensity and depth. Particularly near the beginning, it incorporates a lot of horror elements to promote suspense and draw you in, while we see ample engaging action sequences throughout as well.\\n\\n\r\n\"Drawing you in. Closer and closer\", seems like a perfect quote to elaborate upon HOW you will experience the show. Opening with the aforementioned element of supernatural mystery and horror (though admittedly rather slowly), more questions are posed, as EVERYTHING escalates. Continually: the action intensifies (as conflicts grow larger), drama heightens (as we near answers), the element of morality becomes overwhelming (as countless philosophical concepts and reflections of society are made more prominent). From the beginning, I had no idea that that things would escalate and culminate in the way that they did by the final episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe show takes many turns, and indeed has many levels. There is a genuine sense of enthrallment to note about the action sequences if you have doubts. From start to finish, it feels like you're going against a larger, invisible force. It's ceaselessly  engaging: a story of corruption and forbidden knowledge told from a dangerous first had perspective, while incorporating elements of morality and such, in a way that does not dry out one's \"lake of interest\". Know that i'm not exaggerating, but somehow the show managed to become both a thrill ride, and on top of that: a completely perspective-shifting lesson of morality.\\n\\n\r\nWhat struck me most at the particularly impactful conclusion, was the way that every little detail was relevant, and ended up being integrated into a very well-rounded and unexpected (to say the least) turn of events - comparing to the comparative tranquility of the first few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOn top of this almost inconceivably ideal and engaging storytelling, we do also get an insight into the perspectives most prominently, of our main characters. They mature (literally) as the show persists; making the anime a worthwhile \"bildungsroman\". With the most notable protagonists being Saki and Satoru, (Saki the main heroine): we see them evolve subtly from a relatively clueless perspective, to one that ends up shaping the story's conclusion. Particularly with Saki, we get a very intimate insight into her thought processes, which works very well in allowing us to associate ourselves with her given situations. Shinsekai allows you to forge this sort of connection with Saki in particular, while Satoru is somewhat more straightforward. The integrity of this emotional connection is by no means especially extensive, but nevertheless: enough to make you fear when she fears, and root for her protection to the bitter end. The development on this front is very personal, and somewhat reliant upon sentiment from prior episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe main point of praise in the character department is the effortless and almost unnoticeable evolution of our protagonists, as they become strengthened in the face of the countless injustices, conflicts, and trials to come - as is expected of course, of those who obtain forbidden knowledge of their village's dark history.\\n\\n\r\nAudiovisuals now...\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is frustratingly fought by two sides.\\n\r\nOn the one hand, the scenery is immaculately detailed and artistic. The show isn't afraid to be quite abstract, at times with a somewhat dream-like, and Utopian feel. It's impossible not to be somewhat enthralled by the depth and detail of the beautifully crafted landscapes - as they do prove to be particularly immersive and \"real\".\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the animation of the characters themselves is simplistic, and utterly contradicts the detail of the scenery. The characters blatantly walk like overlays between the foreground and background, and the quality of their movements (such as mouth movement) is jepordised heavily by this conflicting simplicity, and notable choppiness even of the animation.\\n\\n\r\nI have no qualms about the finished, animated product (as it still looks great): as pros still significantly outweigh the cons. At times I remember remarking that the landscapes are simply breathtaking, but I simply can't say that the animation is without fault, given the choppiness of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound aspect is incredibly appropriate. Filling silences with atmospheric audio, and conveying the impact of even the most minute of audible details. The soundtrack too, is very immersive. It greatly enhances the otherworldly sense of wonderment of the landscapes, and the ever-increasing scale of events is helped by this often operatic and moody BGM.\\n\r\nAdmittedly, I did tire from the overused \"operatic choir boy\" music especially nearer the start; as it became annoying more than anything else.\\n\\n\r\nIn every other sub department though, the audio was of a very high standard, and it really added to the sense of scale of the story line as it took form. While a little short of \"perfect\", The sense of wonderment in the audiovisual department is simply unending...\\n\\n\r\nI may be getting blood out of a stone here, but perhaps my watching experience would have been even more enjoyable if there was a more extensive and personal background development of more of the protagonists. I could however say this about any anime, so ultimately: Shinsekai yori is nothing short of a masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nThe evolution of the characters, unexpectedly dramatic, deception-oriented story line, stellar storytelling and great pacing... undoubtedly equates to a brilliantly gripping show of substance and depth. It incorporates a wide spectrum of genres, and so I don't believe that anyone is exempt from my suggestion to you, the reader... to check it out :)\\n\\n\r\n~ I don't know what's right or what's wrong anymore ~",

            "content": "\u201cShinsekai yori\u201d also known as \u201dFrom the New World\u201d is dark story set in a utopia, or maybe depending on what person you are, a dystopia. Many dark and horrible secrets are kept from the children in an attempt to integrate them into to the utopic world that they are born in. I have only seen two episodes so this review is based on those two episodes. \r\nIf I am not mistaken the story is narrated by the future main character, who the watcher through the anime very smoothly and well. The first two episodes the anime manages to be lighthearted and at first glanceit might look like a \u201cslice of life\u201d, but there are some clear signs that the peace won\u2019t last. These signs and symbolic stories, that can be related to propaganda, that appear are very smartly placed and through this achievement, the mood that the created is something on par with many other great animes. A flaw could be that telling the story of a dystopia through 12 year old kids probably isn\u2019t the most fitting and realistic thing to do. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the art, I can\u2019t give the same praise as for the story. Yes, it is good, but it isn\u2019t the best. The only thing that I find good is the parts when the stories are being told and I do find the disproportional eyes sometimes disturbing, but otherwise there is nothing special about that. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is just like the art, something that doesn\u2019t stand out. The soundtrack is doing its job, creating the desired mood for the different scenes, but no tracks that is especially memorable or good enough to listen on the bus ride home. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in the anime are just like the other things, well done but not supreme. There aren\u2019t an enormous amount of characters to remember, and they don\u2019t over complicate them. So far there are no unrealistic characters/personalities that wouldn\u2019t exist in the real world. The main characters are though surprisingly mature and wise for their age, but otherwise they are easy to recognize, and they are all different from each other. They all seem to have a kind of deeper thoughts going on in their small heads, thinking about the world and the system, unlike most kids in their age. \\n\\n\r\nThis is a very story driven anime, and it will leave cliffhangers after many episodes, and if you are prepared of that this is an anime I would highly recommend to people to start to watch. After watching an episode it leaves a lot of questions in your head, not about the anime, but about the world itself. If it is good to create a twisted utopia or is it better to leave the world like it is right now?\\n\\n\r\nSummary time:\\n\r\nStory 8/10 or possibly 9/10 the story seems promising and is very appealing to me\\n\r\nArt: 7/10 nothing special but still good\\n\r\nSound: 7/10 nothing special, but succeeds to create desired mood for the anime\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10 again nothing special, realistic and deep to a certain degree\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10 I personally really like dystopia/utopia stories like 1984 and The Giver\\n\r\nOverall so far (2 episodes seen): an easy 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI want to apologize for my poor English and my lack of experience when it comes to reviewing anime (this is my second one), so if you have time please give me some kind of feedback.\\n",

            "content": "Honestly, I\u2019m not sure exactly what it was that got me interested in watching From the New World (Shinsekai yori). Maybe it was the artwork, or the interesting plot synopsis. Maybe it was the high praise it had received from several different sights, or the positive fan reviews. I don\u2019t know, but, I guess, it doesn\u2019t really matter because for some reason I did end up watching this series. The question is, did it live up to all of the praise surrounding it, or is it just another overhyped series? \r\nStory:\r\nThe story takes place in Japan one thousand years from now, in a world wherehumanity has discovered, and developed, supernatural telekinetic abilities. People have used this ability to form a utopian society where all humans live together in harmony. But all is not as it seems. There are rumors about mysterious cats that abduct children, and, even though several children start disappearing, no one seems to notice or care all that much about it. Something is definitely not right in village of Kamisu 66. What\u2019s really going on in this supposed utopia? That is the question that starts the long, and incredible journey of our main characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is told from the perspective of five characters. All of the characters attend the same school and are apart of the same class group, group one. As well as the story being told primary from her point of view, the main character, Saki, also doubles as the narrator for the series. The story takes place over several years, and information is slowly revealed to you each episode. From the New World uses a lot of flashbacks to provide background information on the characters and the world itself. This makes the amount of time that the story covers even larger and will help keep you engaged in the story. The show is constantly progressing and is purposely vague, and you\u2019ll have to continue to watch the series in order to fully understand what\u2019s going on. The story is continuously building upon itself by using great writing and foreshadowing to build tension and suspense. \\n\\n\r\nFrom the New World also does a great job of building the world that characters are living in. While initially, and purposefully, vague you will come to understand why the world is like it is. The story provides a detailed history of how the world became the way it is, and what it was like before. This provides essential context to the events that are currently occurring, and it was all explained really well. Even though there are several flashbacks and time skips, the story never felt rushed. Everything was built up and explained really well. There are also other things that will be mentioned or subtly alluded to, and you\u2019ll have to be paying attention to understand what\u2019s being referenced and shown to you. \\n\\n\r\nThere is a lot more to the story but it would be hard to talk about a lot of it without spoiling it, and that\u2019s the last thing I want to do. The story is really well done, and it concludes with a fantastic ending that wraps almost everything up. And the thing that is left open is where the ending really shines. The world is messed up and they know that it is, but the beauty of the ending is the hope for a better world in the future. \\n\\n\r\nI had no major issues with the story, but there was one small thing that I wished was explained a little better. That thing is the psychic powers of humans in this series. Not their origin or exactly what causes it, because it\u2019s said that even the characters in the series aren\u2019t totally sure of that, but the limits of those abilities. While there are definitely people in the series who are better at using their powers than others, I never got a sense of what they could or couldn\u2019t do with their abilities, other than the parameters explained at the beginning of the series. I just wonder if there really wasn\u2019t away to deal with some of the problems that the characters in the series run into. But, that is a very minor issue. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\\n\r\nFrom the New World has a unique animation style, and it\u2019s pretty fantastic. The characters are all animated really well, and have distinct features that separate them from one another. The series places these unique character models on top of great looking background scenery, which is varied and pleasing to look at. And, at times, the background scenery looked fantastic all by itself. The backgrounds usually have an almost painted look to them, which helps it to create beautiful scenes. \\n\\n\r\nFrom the New World also uses different types of animation throughout the series. During some flashbacks and fight scenes you\u2019ll see a totally different style of animation. Sometimes, the entire scene uses this style, but in others it\u2019s mixed in with the original style. It\u2019s done in a way that doesn\u2019t make it feel out of place, but in a way that actually blends in perfectly with the other style of animation. \\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned earlier, this series does have some fight scenes, which are all animated really well. It does a good job at showing the audience how a lot of the invisible actions of the character\u2019s psychic abilities affect the people that they are fighting, and the objects that they are using. \\n\\n\r\nOther than a couple of times when it looked like the characters lacked a little detail, the animation was great throughout the entire series.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nIf you couldn\u2019t already tell From the New World is a pretty dark series and, for the most part, its soundtrack (OST) reflects that. The OST is large, and showcases several different tracks that can fit the tone of any scene that the series portrays. While the series leans a lot more towards the dark side, there are light hearted, and heartfelt, moments in the series. There are plenty of slow, sad songs, and up-tempo, upbeat songs to fit those moments as well. \\n\\n\r\nThe OST also features several different ways of presenting its music. While there are plenty of dark and thrilling tracks they present them to the audience in different ways. The OST uses several different genres of music, from rock, to hip-hop and even a little bit of trance. This adds even more variety to the music that the series uses. \\n\\n\r\nWhile From the New World doesn\u2019t have an opening, other than the second ending that the used as an opening for episode 16, the OST is complimented by two great endings. The second ending is particularly good because it is debuted during a critical character moment in the series, and every time you hear it it\u2019ll make you think back to those events. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nFrom the New World stars five main characters: Maria Akizuki, Shun Aonuma, Satoru Asahina, Mamoru Itou, and Saki Watanabe. All of the characters in this series have their own distinct personalities and ways of doing things. They are a fun group to watch because of the interactions between all of the characters. \\n\\n\r\nSome people might say that this series doesn\u2019t have a lot of character development, and, in away, they\u2019re right. None of the characters in this series change very much in terms of their individual personalities, but you can definitely see the characters change significantly in other ways. \\n\\n\r\nAs I just mentioned, the characters in From the New World don\u2019t change who they are at their core, and I think that that\u2019s something that makes these characters different from a lot of other characters. The story takes place over several years, and we get to see how the characters change during that time period. While who they are as characters doesn\u2019t change, their view of the world they live in and the relationships they have with one another do. \\n\\n\r\nThere are several great side characters in this series. Even though they weren\u2019t given the most detailed background story, or even developed to a great degree, they were excellent characters that each added something meaningful to the story. Without spoiling exactly who it is, I also have to mention the amazing antagonist. The character was fantastic, and will get you thinking about the characters motivations and if they are in fact justified. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all likable and enjoyable to watch. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed watching From the New World. This is probably the only anime that I\u2019ve re-watched that I can say I enjoyed watching just as much as when I watched it the first time, if not more. This series was great on all fronts, and it\u2019s a shame it hasn\u2019t gotten the publicity that it deserves. \\n\\n\r\nThis isn\u2019t a series that you can just watch the first couple of episodes of, and get an understanding of what\u2019s going to happen next or even what\u2019s going on. Information is given to you throughout the entire series, and even when you think you know what\u2019s going on, there will be another twist that will yank you right back into the story. \\n\\n\r\nVerdict and Breakdown: \\n\\n\r\nStory: 4.8/5\\n\r\nAnimation: 4.4/5\\n\r\nSound: 4.6/5\\n\r\nCharacters: 4.4/5\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4.6/5\\n\r\nVerdict: 4.6/5\\n\\n\r\nFrom the New World is a brilliant story that will keep you thoroughly entertained, as well as make you think. There are some philosophical questions that this series proposes that are definitely interesting, and tough to answer. But, that\u2019s part of the reason this series is so good and why I highly recommend this series\\n",

            "content": "Shinsekai Yori is an amazing anime that questions the human condition without sympathy or bias and builds a world so convincing and complete that you almost feel like an expert on it by the time you finish the series. Watching the anime, an ominous air is apparent even from the start when the main characters are still children. The art style is truly unique among the anime I've watched. Landscapes, buildings and outfits are realistic and detailed while the characters wear versatile anime archetype faces. The mood of the show is set by its use of bright color palletes to create familiarity and a senseof comfort while surrealist, almost nightmarish artstyles here and there remind you that this is an anime that deals with the dark recesses of the human mind and the unnerving unknown out there in the world. The story might seem slow at first but imagine being flung into a future where society and life on earth itself are completely unlike anything we can relate to. To get our bearings we have to take baby steps to understand world that Shinsekai Yori is set in, so it was a natural choice that our worldview is built side-by-side with the main characters as they grow and begin to understand the reality they live in - and the questions the anime poses about what it means to be human, how it feels to love, lose and live on, and how to best organize society are just as applicable to us in the present as they are important to the characters. We watch the main cast of group one through the innocence of their idyllic childhood, the drama of their teenage years and their development into adults who still bear the marks of their youth but still soldier on. I feel blessed that this anime (and the novel which preceded it) was made, and that I had the chance to watch it and talk about it over the internet. To any of you who are doubting the veracity of this anime, don't. This is a masterpiece that has left me with many questions, and a lingering sense of hope. A feeling so rare that I'm here writing my first anime review.",

            "content": "Has an anime ever give you strange dreams at night? Well, this was the case for me, and by strange I do not mean ghosts or anything of that sort; the dreams are just strange...\r\nStory - 9\r\n This anime is situated 1000 years from now, and the protagonists as well as many other characters you encounter are telekinesis (PK) users(since there is an actual summary I won't bother about summarizing the story too much).To me the story is quite original. Although there are many takes on animes that about societies and government, I believe this anime has one of the best concept and story line.Theart, suspense, mystery, and darkness are masterfully woven to keep you on the edge of your seat. The themes and story of this anime is dark and depressing. There were a few episodes in the middle that have made me lose partial interest, but that interest is gained back almost instantly with the following episodes. Most of the time while watching this, you would find yourself confused and lost, however, as you start watching more you begin to gain understanding on it. I would describe this as when you watch an episode you are confused,then as you watch another, you think you have found the pieces in the puzzle until the anime throws in yet another mystery. This process continues to repeat until you finish the anime. Yes, what a troll (: \\n\\n\r\nArt + Sound- 9\\n\r\nI absolutely love the animation and art of this anime. It fits the theme and story well . There is just something unique about it. As you get to certain episodes you might find the art/animation to be different, the reason is because some episodes were made with another director. The sound was perfect for this anime, the music was deep and invoke thoughts as well as emotions. Even though I finished it, I can hear the song playing in my head, haha.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-9\\n\r\n Despite the usual cliche line telling that this story is \"about a group of friends\", I must tell you now it is much more than that, It is certainly not some children anime that you might imagine it to be. Shinsekai yori is an incredibly powerful anime, and honestly if you decide not to watch this anime, you are missing out! While this anime might be on the dark and depressing side, it is something entertaining and interesting to watch. I found this show while searching for something to watch and to be honest, it would not be exaggerating to say I found a gem. A friend told me that he started watching at 9 pm and by 6  am,he was still watching. It is one of those compelling animes that will keep you pressing the next button again and again. To those who like bright and funny anime, this might not be the anime for you. Nevertheless, I highly recommend this anime, you never know until you try!!",

            "content": "Shinsekai yori .. I must say that one of the things that i'm proud of, is having Shinsekai Yori on my \"Completed anime\".. this anime worth so much .. the reward at the end made me praise this anime .. \r\nIf I had to chose a word to describe this anime? Masterpiece. It managed to drag my attention since the beginning until the end and it managed to blow my mind with almost everything it has to show. Clear your mind of all clich\u00eas you already saw in psychological anime.. forget everything you know about dystopia anime.. this one will amaze you. \r\nUnlike 99,9% ofthe anime that take place in the future where we have robots or huge machines or a planet destroyed by pollution or whatever the fuck it is, Shinsekai yori has.. a different thing. A new way of living, thinking and act. \\n\\n\r\nI think you already know what this anime is about .. human behaviour. But don\u00b4t think you will watch something like Psycho-pass or anything like that .. again and I repeat: Shinsekai yori has something new to show. \\n\\n\r\nShinsekai Yori is about a utopia created 1000 years from now.. it talks about the human nature and how can we control it and take advantage of it. It explores the possibily of \"what if\" instead of just presenting us with something that we already know about. Let's get started. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10. If there is one tiny problem with this series is tiny mistakes that we can think off while watching the anime. They creat an amazing story, a well crafted one but still I think there are some things that just could be different and don\u00b4t make a lot of sense to me even though being a totally different world. \"Why they didn\u00b4t had anyway to stop that if they kew how devastating it would be ..\" is the question that was left behind and I think it could have an answer but it doesn\u00b4t. \\n\\n\r\nPlus towards the end, I don\u00b4t know why but the anime speeds up a lot and tries to make some action or anything like that and it just looked terribly bad. This is the main reason for not having 10/10 on the story. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest is just amazing .. great story, great world, great fantasy, great plot twists .. what else could you ask? \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10. Well let me tell you something : I loved the art okay .. but I can\u00b4t deny that it is bad. Especially when it comes to action scenes. We can notice the mistakes in the animation, it looks bad for the most part. \\n\\n\r\nBut .. the pallet used, the design of each character, especially our main character, Watanabe Saki, it looks so natural and fluent. It fits so well with the themes and with the plot that it seems that it was intended to (who knows maybe it was ..). \\n\\n\r\nDo you wanna know a funny fact? Many companies didn\u00b4t took Shinsekai yori because and i quote : \" It was too hard to draw scenary retreated in the book\". I think this only proves how awesome this anime is. \\n\\n\r\nAnother great point about the art is how it manages to creat amazing environments and how it manages to retreat the feelings of some character. Often we see metaphorical meaning atached to the anime that only could exist with the right art so .. they did an excelent job. But again, in technical terms the anime is not fluid nor well made, unfortunately. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10. .. no words. Just listen to the OST that I have on my profile and you will understand the greatness of this anime. Amazing OST that is often used as a opening(this anime doesn\u00b4t have an opening theme). The only problem with that? They kinda screwed up. At the beginning that track is only used to finish some scene and start the episode. It usually was used after some mind blowing scene or so .. and the impact was huge ! But after some eps they abuse of that track , they start using it everywhere and it ends up looking bad. \\n\\n\r\nThe first ending is fucking amazing as well. Every single episode hearing those first seconds of the ending was a pleasure to my brain. What a magnificient way of ending an episode. But it ends up being changed and the second ending wasn\u00b4t that great. The rest of the tracks used are fine, nothing like the first ending and that track that I talked about but still good enough. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10. Watanabe Saki was one of the best protagonist i've ever seen so far. I loved her. The voice acting was delightful to hear. Great personality, great density. She can be considered as a bi-dimmensional character since she has two sides. Watch the anime to explore each one of them ;) I won\u00b4t spoil a thing. \\n\\n\r\nThe other characters are likeable but .. well they are just normal characters. The only thing that they all have in commun is the unpredictable choices. We can\u00b4t really tell what will they do because we never know what's going on on their minds. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10. Well this is the weakest point. The Achilles tendon of this anime. In order to present us such an amazing story and characters, this anime needs a lot of develop, which means a lot of dialogues and explanations, in other words, boring stuff. The first 10 eps are really hard to watch. Mainly based on plot develop and character develop, the first 10 eps are essencial to the anime but that doesn\u00b4t mean that they are good. Don\u00b4t get me wrong, I still liked them but I couldn\u00b4t watch more than 2 eps at a time. \\n\\n\r\nAfter 10 eps we really get to the good stuff, the good material which is their adolescence. Oh did I forget to tell you? This anime follows an entire life, since the young age of 6 years old to the adult age, 30 years. Another great point of this anime. By doing this, we experience how is it living in such utopia by hearing our witnesses. And that is really such an amazing feeling. It makes us wonder how it would be like. \\n\\n\r\nAfter the 10th ep, this anime just gets better and better until the very last moment of the last episode. I was amazed .. with a huge smile on my face saying \"It ended\" ! And this is a rare feeling though. Not often I say this because normally is always something missing or something that could be better. This time .. it didn\u00b4t. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.5/10. I can not forgive the lack of enjoyment at the beginning and the flaws that it has but still this anime is really worth to watch. It has my seal of approval and I reccomend it to everyone! Even if you find it really boring just give it a try, don\u00b4t give up in the first eps..",

            "content": "Shinsekai Yori Reveiw:\r\nStory: Shinsekai Yori has one of the best plot lines I have watched so far. This story, from the very beginning, hints that there is something not right with the world around them like the rumors of the monster cats and the disappearing children as mentioned in the synopsis. From this point on the five main characters proceed to slowly find out about the darker side that plagues their town. This story will have you watching the next episode as soon at the first ends. Just a warning though, this is a very dark anime and It may make you sad at times.\\n\r\nI gave the story a 10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound was good, I guess. Most of the time you will be too engrossed in the story to even notice that there is actually music in the background. As for the opening and closing songs, well how do I put this, there was no opening song and just goes straight into the anime. I am definitely not complaining though since this gave more time to the story and a couple of cut scenes that show what happen in the past. The ending song, I didn't really listen to because I was already to the next episode, but from what I heard of the first few seconds of it, It was most likely pretty good. \\n\r\nI gave the sound an 8 \\n\\n\r\nArt: The art of Shinsekai Yori is in one work amazing. The scenery of the Japan of the future can only be described as a rural country with all the beauty that comes from nature, these scenes usually happen when the story takes a break an gives the viewer a moment to catch their breath. Other than that the artwork is fitting with the story, dark. One other mention on the artwork would be the eyes of the characters in the story, while there is not much detail in the facial expressions of the characters, the eyes do a great job of showing the emotions of the characters. \\n\r\nI gave the Art a 9 \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters are the best part of Shinsekai Yori. You get to see how the characters develop during the course of this story, how they interact with each other, and the decisions that they make along the way. Not only that but every decision that they make is something the the viewer can understand because who doesn't have a burning sense of curiosity, well besides that dead cat over there.  The actors also did a great job of getting the emotions of all the characters spot on and this made this show even more incredible. Its hard to describe the characters besides saying that the main characters are a great match and that you have to watch this show to understand how great they are.\\n\r\nI gave the Characters a 10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Well in my opinion if the characters and the story line are amazing I will pretty much love the show. Shinsekai Yori had both of these and the other aspects of this anime is great as well. I would have watched this anime in one day if I did not have other things I had to do, that alone says that I enjoyed this anime quite a bit.\\n\r\nI gave the Enjoyment a 10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Lets start with the score this time, I gave Shinsekai Yori a 10 overall. The story and the characters have a lot of pull with me when it comes to watching an anime and when a story has these aspects I can overlook other fault that an anime has, amazingly this anime didn't have many faults to begin with and I enjoyed this anime immensely. I must say that this is a dark anime and the characters have to make tough decisions along the way, and in some places this anime becomes depressing. This is not an anime for children.",

            "content": "This is my first time writing a review for an anime I watched. I just want this out of my chest. I feel it\u2019s imperative to share what I thought of Shinsekai Yori so I\u2019d give it a try.\r\nThis will contain some spoiler, sorry. xD\r\nIt started slowly, with bits and pieces of information. From past to present. Back and forth. Giving clues without revealing anything. The premise? Six children, a special friendship, an unspoken love and a twisted town. People have this ability called cantus, the power of telekinesis which is awakened once a child reached ten years of age.\r\nSaki, Satoru, Shun, Maria, Mamoru andRei were classmates and friends. However, due to some event, Rei disappeared, leaving no trace in the memories of the remaining children.\\n\\n\r\nThe turning point of the story happened in their summer camp when they were twelve years old. Five of them accidentally stumbled upon information that shouldn\u2019t be available to them, thus, their bloody and painful adventure begin.\\n\\n\r\nWe live in a cruel world, indeed. Shinsekai Yori is a mirror of our world. From standpoint of society and norm, the concept of right and wrong, safe and dangerous, of what is acceptable and what is not. It made me see myself as part of society in a different light. Society always justifies its deed saying it\u2019s for the greater good. Sacrifice a few to save many. Surely it works. Even I cannot deny that. *sigh*\\n\\n\r\nWhen I started watching Shinsekai Yori, I had no expectation, whatsoever. Although I read the plot beforehand, I didn\u2019t remember it much (since, as I said utopian and dystopian world aren\u2019t new nowadays). First few episodes didn\u2019t impress me, if I were to describe what I thought of it, I\u2019d say it was strange, so strange. Surprisingly, as strange as it was, it kept me looking forward to the next episode. While I was trying to figure out the story, I was hooked beyond recovery. No words can explain how strange it was and how I was captivated by its beauty.\\n\\n\r\nThe story was mesmerizing. It challenges your belief, questions your sanity, confronts your inner self, and dare you to be free from what is accepted by norm and society. Wanting to change but unable to change. And because there will be always fear of the unknown, we tend to stay in our comfort zone.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve always known that Satoru and Saki will end up with each other. I just knew it in my heart. But I also knew that there is something between Saki and Shun, a deeper bond that no one could break (even when Shun is gone, their soul is still connected). It was a red string of fate that transcends even afterlife. But I must admit I NEVER ever for once did see it coming for Satoru and Shun, Saki and Maria. It shocked the hell out me. Happiness, indeed (hahaha. \uf04a Please excuse the yaoi fangirl in me). I was lost in that brief moment. It\u2019s like I died and reborn again. I feel twisted, happy and satisfied. Why? Because it tackles love in the most indiscriminate way. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a boy or a girl, or what gender you prefer your partner to be. You just love a person regardless of gender. It\u2019s really liberating. Almost refreshing.\\n\\n\r\nSatoru loved Shun, Shun also loved Satoru but he also loved Saki and Saki loved him, too. Saki loved Maria, Maria loved Saki too but she also loved Mamoru, that\u2019s why she cannot abandon him when she needed her most. And after everything that happened, Satoru and Saki grew to love each other too. It was a slow but sure love. I believed that the love the five of them have for each other is beyond comprehension. But somehow, I understood. In the end, I realized that maybe, just maybe it\u2019s really true that we will end up with the person that we\u2019re meant to be. No matter how painful the road we would take. \\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m sure Satoru and Saki will name their child Shun if it\u2019s a boy and Maria if it\u2019s a girl. Because deep in their hearts they still long for them but still they are happy with each other and that the heart is really capable of loving more than one person\u2026\\n\\n\r\nSo I say it was the most beautiful love triangle in the world.\\n\\n\r\nWill I recommend it? Of course. Although, I think it isn\u2019t for everyone. But if you would want something with a different touch, you must watch it. Dystopian world always has this mood that is melancholy. There were moments I needed to take a deep breath to control the emotions that was building up in me. Guess you really have to take the good with the bad, so they say. I couldn\u2019t agree more.",

            "content": "Shin Sekai Yori is a very atmospheric show, largely due to the brilliant OST that dances on in the background, alternating between calm and tempest in the most seamless fashion. I have therefore given the sound a 10, and this is well deserved.\r\nI think the background art adds to the atmosphere as well but the character art is incredibly dull and boring. While arguably some characters end up looking decent the style itself is bland, as bland as the characters themselves, and that brings us to my main gripe with this show, the lack of interesting or inspiring characters. \r\nWhat we have here is astrange dystopia where everyone has been brainwashed and conditioned. While this is a great plot device it also makes for a boring show with flat characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot takes time to build up and frequent time skips are used as a device to bring the plot forward and give some depth to otherwise boring characters. I cannot help but feel that this device is abused - as it is used too many times in the space of such a short series. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the plot does raise some deep questions about humanity, the questions this show raises are largely ignored by the cast and left to the viewer to consider. The plot itself is incredibly predictable. I already knew how the show would end by the half way mark, and was able to predict the following events quite accurately if not completely so. \\n\\n\r\nI'll leave it to you guys to judge for yourselves, but I for one was not impressed. \\n",

            "content": "Topics such as the future of human civilization have been explored many times throughout different mediums, be it novels, scientific textbooks or movies; anime is no exception. Each of these mediums portray different hypothesis and ideas, be it the more predominant option the technologically advanced civilization or a decaying and/or primitive one. Shinsekai Yori defies the first option and focuses on a regressive, primitive civilization centered around a simple lifestyle as villagers.\r\n~Story~\r\nThe story of Shinsekai Yori is well developed and presented. It takes place in a village barred from the outside world in Japan, a millenia after the current civilization. Humanity is known to possesthe power of psychokinesis, also known as the power of the \"Gods\" for coexisting, intelligent species in this underdeveloped world. The narrative follows the main protagonist Saki Watanabe and her close friends, who after obtaining their powers, attend to the Sage Academy to train it. Shinsekai's story starts subtle with exhibiting the daily life of the protagonists, but with mysteries such as abduction and disappearance of children by monstrous cats. Together with the mysteries that surround this village, the audience will begin to appreciate and understand how the world is shaped as the narrative progresses. It is nothing pleasant, in fact, it's dark and obscure.\\n\\n\r\nAs the story develops, the spectator observes Saki's growth from 12 to 26 years of age. Throughout the different incidents that happen in that period, the narrative portrays human nature well: paranoia, isolation, fear of the unknown, egoism, resentment and brain washing, which ultimately shows how humanity didn't evolve at all in the last millenia. Even with experimentation and psychokinesis, humans are still frail and weak. To narrate the story with a good pacing, time skips are introduced to focus on the important parts of the story. This leads to a lack of certain gradual character development I personally like to see. \\n\\n\r\nOther strong point of Shinsekai Yori is how at every question/mystery that rises, the story hints at the solutions leaving the audience to ponder about it, while ultimately explaining it in detail later on. All is clarified with convincing and realistic facts, such as the coexisting species or different memory wipes the protagonist undergo. This enhances the overall experience and credibility of the story. Nevertheless, some things remained unexplained such the sudden homosexual attraction between the same gender or the origin of psychokinesis; this was however a small drawback.\\n\\n\r\n~Characters~\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of characters are by no means big; this doesn't mean it's necessary. Some of the main characters are emotionally unstable, with sudden drastic changes in emotion: from being out of control to suddenly calm, or from crying to laughing. This is specially in Saki's case, though being considered strong willed and stable, she sways from one action/emotion to another. Throughout her growth she becomes more mature, but often acts childish later on. Nevertheless, some of her actions represent well the egoistic and doubtful nature humanity tends to have. As the protagonists interact and learn about the mysteries and their environment, the spectator can observe how they develop.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast of Shinsekai Yori fulfilled their purpose very well. There is good variation and development of the coexisting species known as \"Querats\", the so-called \"Karma Demons\", as well as the other humans of the village who provide insight into the history and mysteries behind this new world. Distrust and paranoia is well presented through these.\\n\\n\r\n~Animation and sound~\\n\\n\r\nThe animation fulfills it purpose, though it is rather lacking in some aspects. The different characters presented are simple in design, and at times were drawn rather lackluster. Other thing to note are that the facials expressions of the characters often didn't match with the emotional state of the characters, leading to a less enjoyable experience. The different species shown are creatively drawn, but again, maybe more detail would be favorable. Nevertheless, the different scenes and backgrounds are well displayed throughout the use of different colours and animation techniques which matches well with the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors certainly fulfilled their role well, though because of the faulty animation of the character's emotions, didn't fully reach their potential. The soundtracks used are very favourable and matches with the narrative of the story, used to further transmit the atmosphere of the anime and catch the spectators full attention.\\n\\n\r\n~Enjoyment~\\n\\n\r\nShinsekai Yori was overall a fantastic journey representing a primitive and dystopian civilization with a wonderful story and representation of it, while leaving the spectator pondering about the current civilization and beliefs. I personally disliked the main character, which kept me from fully enjoying the anime. Though it has a slow start, the pacing improves to match the events that take place. I'd fully recommend Shinsekai Yori to anyone with an interest in the dystopian or mystery genre, or want an other perspective on the future of humanity, as done with titles such as Texhonolyze or Psycho-Pass.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading.\\n",

            "content": "Were I to summarize Shinsekai Yori in a single word, that word would be \u201cintelligent\u201d. If I could add a second word? \u201cToo\u201d.\r\nShinsekai Yori is a highly regarded anime about a group of children who live a thousand years in the future. However, their future is not one of advanced technology, of aliens and space-travel. These children \u2013 all of the humans we see, really \u2013 possess a psychic ability called \u201cCantus\u201d and live in a society more reminiscent of ancient Japan than anything one might associate with the future. Their village, though seemingly idyllic, is not all that it seems. Outside the holy barrier,fiends, karma demons, and other creatures are said to lurk. Further, the humans are served by the rather disgusting bakenezumi, or queerats, an intelligent species of bi-pedal rats who are, of course, more than they appear.\\n\\n\r\nThis sounds like an interesting premise, and Shinsekai Yori\u2019s first four episodes \u2013 often derided as a weak point \u2013 hold a great deal of promise. Slow and deliberately paced, they reveal much about the setting and hint at mysteries and incongruities waiting to be revealed. But episode five is where things change. Whilst the first four episodes are slower and feel like a mix of dystopia, fantasy, and horror, the next three feel more like a fast-paced action-adventure. The episodes following those three are more a slow romantic drama, and so on. This isn\u2019t necessarily a weakness, but leads to a rather halting pace early on, as the viewer is confront with jarring shifts in tone. This suggests that, whether or not the writers knew what they wanted to do with this story, they didn\u2019t know how best to achieve it.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the story itself, it only begins to materialize around the halfway point. That\u2019s not to say that the first half of the story is a series of episodic adventures, nor that what occurs there doesn\u2019t have any bearing on what follows, but rather that things take a while to come together. There are several twists and moments of legitimate surprise. All of these things are properly foreshadowed for the astute viewer, and I don\u2019t think the storytelling really relies on twists or surprises to move things along, either. However, due to the shifts in tone mentioned above, the story lacks a certain momentum. There is a bit of deus ex machina near the end, though the characters still need their own ingenuity to resolve the plot. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters prove another chink in Shinsekai Yori\u2019s armor. Our protagonist is a young girl named Saki. She is the narrator. She is the person through whose eyes we witness the story. As protagonists go, Saki is fairly bland. She is competent and courageous and able to face many of the harsh truths that she and her friends uncover as the story unfolds. This last part is a bit of a problem, however. At one point, Saki is told by one of her mentors that her ability to stay calm in the face of the many revelations and events that she encounters means that she will eventually have a position of authority and import within the village. But in a story that is somewhat dystopian in outlook, having a protagonist who is unflappable is a hindrance rather than a strength. These kinds of stories want characters with more vitality. Struggling with unpleasant truths makes a character compelling; however, we never see Saki truly grapple with the injustice and cold utilitarianism of the world in which she lives.\\n\\n\r\nSaki\u2019s friends prove more capable of emoting than she. (Well, three of them do; Shun is even more of a wet noodle.) However, because the story cleaves so closely to Saki\u2019s perspective, we rarely get a full glimpse of what they\u2019re thinking or how they feel about things. A perfect example of this happens in the middle of the story. Two of Saki\u2019s friends make a decision with significant consequences, but there\u2019s very little foreshadowing that they intend to make this decision. We do discover their reasoning after it happens. On the one hand, this makes their decision surprising; on the other, these characters end up feel like card-board cut-outs for Saki to react to, rather than characters with real emotions or motives. Even a few conversations hinting at certain feelings or thoughts might have alleviated this problem, but to my recollection, no such conversations occur.\\n\\n\r\nFurther, though this story takes place over the course of fourteen years, we never see these characters change. The Saki at the end of the story knows more than the Saki at the beginning, but she\u2019s still largely the same. She\u2019s mature, she\u2019s capable, she\u2019s courageous, she\u2019s kind; she\u2019s all that she was in the beginning, and not much more. Characters are the engine of a story, regardless of its medium. If those characters aren\u2019t compelling in themselves, they should be put in situations that make them compelling. But whilst Saki and her friends can be said to experience a series of events that might be described as interesting, those events fail to make them compelling.\\n\\n\r\nThe most compelling characters are two of the queerats, Squealer and Kiroumaru. Squealer is a character I can\u2019t say that I like, but he manages to be interesting and complex in a way that the human characters are not. Kiroumaru proves a perfect foil and displays as much depth and complexity as Squealer, whilst providing a differing viewpoint on humans, queerats, and their respective societies. Truly, Shinsekai Yori would have benefited from including more of these two.\\n\\n\r\nA final note about the writing. Prior to watching Shinsekai Yori, I had heard it was a series steeped in moral complexity. This is true to a degree. However, much of that complexity is rather abstract. Whilst events do unfold that are meant to make the viewer ask if the ends ever justify the means, the characters are never asked the same question. This certainly adds a lot to post-viewing discussions, but contributes to the characters seeming shallow and passive. They are never forced to confront the realities of their world in a morally meaningful way.\\n\\n\r\nShinsekai Yori\u2019s art direction is a mixed bag. For the most part, the backgrounds are well done, and occasionally they\u2019re even beautiful. Likewise, the overall aesthetic of the series \u2013 the architecture, the way the characters dress, the designs of the queerats and wildlife \u2013 is one of a kind. I\u2019ve never seen an anime with quite the same look as this one. The animation itself is average, at best. There are some well-animated scenes in the first episode \u2013 especially the opening sequence set in modern-day Tokyo \u2013 and the unique style of episode ten is befitting of the events that occur in that episode. However, episode five\u2019s animation is abominable, and I noticed during some of the middle episodes that the characters at times seemed a little off, especially when speaking. Shinsekai Yori did not have a large budget, so this is pretty understandable, but it\u2019s worth noting.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound design is better. There are several recurring bits of background music that are affecting and help to enhance the mood of particular scenes. I\u2019m not fluent in Japanese, and so can\u2019t comment on how convincing the voice acting was, but I will say that none of the characters\u2019 voices seemed out of place.\\n\\n\r\nOften described as deep and profound, Shinsekai Yori is undoubtedly intelligent. It has many ideas, many things to say. This is not a bad thing, in itself, but I think that Shinsekai Yori\u2019s writers were ultimately overwhelmed by all the things they felt they had to say. A shorter series might have forced them to pick a theme and stick to it; a longer one might have allowed them to more adequately explore all the ideas already present in this twenty-five episode anime. As it is, we find ourselves with two central themes and several lesser ideas that are never given enough space to grow. I think, as well, that this emphasis on thought-provoking ideas contributed to several of the problems I tried to touch on in this review.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a lot more that I could say, but I did not want to include any spoilers in this review. I would recommend to prospective viewers that they go in not expecting much from the narrative and characters. Even if you should judge them more favorably than I do, they are still much weaker than the ideas they try to convey. As for myself, I think the goal of fiction, first and foremost, is to tell a good story with engaging characters \u2013 ideas and themes and the like being of secondary or even tertiary importance. For writers who want to create intellectually engaging stories, it can be a tricky balancing act between narrative, character, and theme, and for me as a viewer, Shinsekai Yori struck the wrong balance.",

            "content": "I have had the hardest time coming up with writing down articulate thoughts on the subject of Shinsekai Yori. Intrinsically, it's a difficult show to review in an unbiased manner. Either it blew you away with its world building, intrigue, intensity, and suspense or it bored you to death in the first act and you couldn't get back into it. It's a shame if people actually feel like the latter, because I believe that that setup is so necessary to make acts 2 and 3 hit you so much harder. Obviously, I reside in the camp of the former and I'll tell you why. (WARNING:I tried to avoid spoiling anything in the following paragraphs, but I probably slipped up somewhere, so tread lightly if you're worried about spoilers.)\\n\\n\r\nShinsekai Yori is one of the best, if not the best show, at tackling foreshadowing. Most of the time, it's done in a way so obvious that it's almost painful. The brilliance of Shinsekai Yori, is that it is so obvious. I mean, it tells you basically the entire plot in the first 4-7 episodes, but does it in such a way that you never connect the dots until later. It does this so cleverly, by disguising their foreshadowing as plot exposition, diverting your attention so smartly. Something else that Shinsekai Yori does masterfully is the time skips that occur throughout the story. There are 3 distinct acts in total, of which the later two are time skips, the first being two years and the second being twelve. The first skip is done more smoothly than the second, but that can be expected, since there's a lot less time to fill in with either exposition or inferring. The way that they're handled within the story is so well done that you barely even recognize that there's a sudden gap in time. Usually, that'd be a bad thing, but in such an information heavy work, it's somewhat helpful to not be bogged down with irrelevant issues. As an aside, the first ending, Wareta Ringo, is among the best songs I've ever heard. In fact, the entire soundtrack is incredible.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the greatest feat of Shinsekai Yori, however, is its skill at showing and rarely telling. There are many instances of this happening throughout the show, where something happens and sometimes you're never told, you're just supposed to have gathered that it has happened. And like I said with the time skips, usually that would be a negative, but in the case of Shinsekai Yori, it's absolutely perfect for the mood of the show. After all, it's a show about intrigue, growing up, and moral grayness.\\n\\n\r\nProbably the only negative that I've really seen regarding Shinsekai Yori, is how dull it is to get into. And that's a somewhat fair argument, if you aren't really interested in the world building taking place. For me, I was absolutely engrossed in the world from episode one, but I understand that that's not how it works for everyone, in which case, this is not the show for you. You have to be prepared to not see much action, but rather, a lot of puzzle pieces to fit together.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not going to touch on the moral questions that Shinsekai Yori raises, since I'd have to delve deep into spoiler territory to discuss, so let it be said that by the end, you won't know who's right. One thing I will say, is that Shinsekai Yori does a fantastic job at constantly changing who you perceive as the villain of the story, you'll notice that the people who you thought were evil at first are not really searching or doing anything that different from Saki and her friends. Shinsekai Yori weaves a wonderful narrative throughout twenty-five episode, keeping you on the edge of your seat the whole time. Anyone who appreciates philosophical, mysterious, thrilling, and coming of age stories will love Shinsekai Yori and perhaps, even if you don't like any of those things, you can still appreciate the greatness of Shinsekai Yori.",

The reason i rated this so highly was mainly for the art, character personality, and the story. In the beginning you will learn about the past of the village. A lot of back story is given so make sure to pay attention. Towards the middle events will start to pick up with many antagonists and a rise in tension between characters and a loop that you might have not seen coming. And finally inthe end which is really what made me enjoy this anime so much was how you were left to sort of piece the history together and try to see everything from the antagonists point of view. Who was the real villain this whole time? That's for you to decide with your opinion on whats right and whats wrong.\\n\r\nHope you enjoy!!!",

            "content": "This is just my opinion on the series. Before going full butthurt at your favorite animu I suggest to think about my points.\r\nStory - 6\r\nI didn't generally like the setting, however that doesn't mean it's a very unique setting, the story is very simple, and gets explained around episode 4, anyway, the progression is incredibly predictable, it's so easy to understand which character is going to die, there's barely any mystery after a few episodes.\r\nArt - 7: The animation isn't something you can really complain about, if you can overlook the off-models. It's not the best animation I ever watched but neither the worst\r\nSound -6: How many times did I have to hear the same overused song in almost every episode (I mean the one that plays at the beginning of episode 1)? It's really a drag, and the fact that it's bloody overused makes it even worse. Apart from the first ending song, I can't remember any remarkable song from this anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 3:\\n\r\nI detest the main character, she's basically the princess in distress which I hate to death. But why not add some romance to it? I dislike romance, but it's so bad in this show that it didn't give me even enough time to whine about it. Furthermore, even if it's later explained, they act like sluts, they're in love with somebody from their same gender and play hugs and kisses, while later they fall in love with someone from the opposite gender, both male and females. I can't really tell which character is the most irritating for this.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 2: If you're here to \"enjoy\" the show, you're just delusional, honestly, there's nothing to enjoy except the slowest development ever and the never ending many dialogues which sometimes take whole episodes to finish, I can explain the enjoyment with one word: BORING, I almost fell asleep while watching this show, it became a real torture to watch it, and I didn't get satisfied in the end either because it was so predictable I might have even saved time by not watching the final episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 6\\n\r\nI expected a wonderful work of mystery and psychology from this show. It's not the worst anime I have ever saw, but it didn't hold my breath even once as people make it look like. The development is so boring that watching Peppa Pig would honestly be less boring than this show. If you're looking for a fast paced anime, forget about ever watching or enjoying this. If you wish to watch something slow, sluggish, and overly boring or you want to waste your time on a mediocre show, go ahead and watch it, but don't expect anything new from this show. I'm truly glad it sold so poorly. There are plenty of novels/manga which deserve to have an anime adaption, why did they even make this one?\\n",

            "content": "This is the most terrifying anime I have ever seen. The last time I've felt something like this was when I first read H. P. Lovecraft.\r\nThe terror comes not from vast amount of gore or violence on the screen - because there's almost none. There's violence, but it's all behind the frame, we never see even a single disfigured human body. The terror comes from a pure concepts that this anime explores.\r\nStory:\r\n     It's a thriller, it grips you and tightens it's hands around you. You feel horrible, but keep watching and it only lets go atthe very end. It's been a long time since I've seen such a good crafted story, with the right hints planted for you to figure out things before they unfold before you, yet with mysteries so clever, that there's a very small of you succeeding.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\n    I would understand if someone doesn't likes it. It's not \"unique\" it's just that they used flat colors for everything. No shading, no gradient. And I liked it. It looks surrealistic, but it doesn't throw you off at first like Katanagatari or Kaiba did.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\n    The tunes kick in the right time and deliver the right kind of emotional push for the given situations. Enhances the story in every way.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\n     It's always hard for me with characters, usually I end up hating them for doing something obviously stupid and not seeing the situation clearly, or by being too perfect, or some other reason. It's rare that I find characters appealing for what they are in the story, rather for what they are. Characters felt good, I don't know what I can add without spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\n     Enjoyment... There was a lot of it, but at the same time - there was none. I felt terrible. The terror of what's going to happen, the pain in the chest from the sorrow after realising what actually happened. I couldn't say I enjoyed watching it. I definitely liked it, but it was not enjoyment that I felt in the process.\\n\\n\r\n     Overall it was the best \"horror\" anime I've ever watched. This was a pure terror. And although it already says \"Rating: R - 17+ (violence & profanity)\", I want to clear up something. There's little to nothing violence on the screen. You never see more than a blood. There is some violence to animals, but very little. And neither is there profanity in any way.\\n\r\nYet this anime is not for children. It's too dark and terrifying for them. And for people who don't like seeing gore - don't worry, you're not going to, it's there, but not on the screen.",

            "content": "This anime is one of those that build up from the start, and It keeps piling on more and more and still succeeds.\r\nThe world that they live in is so strange, so bizzare, and so dangerous. \r\nThe starting episodes are focused questioning how shady the village really is. This show has heavy emphasis on mystery: They keep throwing things at you and makes you keep questioning why. They will keep making you whisper WTF under your breath, lol I know I did. No worries, they start explaining what you need to know after they throw you in a ride for a bit.\r\nCharacters aren't safe inthis anime. It may seem like they are at first, but this show isn't afraid to kill anyone off. You don't need me to tell you because the story feels so eerie throughout, you just feel an impending doom. \\n\\n\r\nWhat makes this anime so cool is their unique worldly setting. The have deep lore and sometimes tell little horror stories on the side that always come true. In fact, a lot of this show has the horror aspect. \\n\\n\r\nThe culture in the show is a lot different from ours. It was very interesting how everyone is Bi, and there isn't a problem with this to them.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are awesome, because you literally grow up with them. You go on a long journey with them, a 25 episode journey. They are believable when it comes to their actions, and they are constantly fighting over what is wrong or what is right. Sometimes the children are smarter than the adults in these cases. \\n\\n\r\nLike I said, their world is DANGEROUS. It is filled with monsters that do WTF IS THAT THING things and one of the main plots of focusing on the monster rats. Every time they leave the damn village, you know shits about to go down, and they leave it a lot.\\n\\n\r\nWith the horror aspect, they do it well. When they have to hide, you know they will die if they get caught. The suspense in the show is intense, and there is always a trust issue with everyone too.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is awesome as always, they play this harmony voice music that goes well with the weird mystic power theme they were going for.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is great, they do a lot of running/sliding/flying as well as showing action.\\n\\n\r\nI feel like the major reason why this anime did so well is the build up. The build up was amazing, you go from staying in town as a kid, leaving town, growing up, adventuring to waste lands, EVERYWHERE. You get to see different villages, creatures, culture... Everything.\\n\r\nThe best part of the build up is towards the last few episodes. It all ties together, there aren't any loose strings, it ends well (bad or good).\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give this show 8.7 or 9 out of 10 monster rats.",

            "content": "Ever since humans have taken their steps out of the mud, they have been the dominant species on this planet. We have advanced ourselves mentally and physically beyond imagination. However, at the same time we retain a child like nature for destruction and self preservation that will some day be our un-doing.\r\nI have to admit this series was the biggest surprise, for it was a title I had no expectations for. I felt like Shinsekai Yori was a title that wouldn't leave much of an impression on me, but it ended up becoming an addiction. It may have tested me at times but in theend it was very good.\\n\\n\r\nI've never been a particular fan of the post apocalyptic type plots. If anything, that would have been the major factor of my slight distaste for the story. The media portrays these type of stories as the cause of our own self destruction.\\n\\n\r\nThats not to say that Shinsekai Yori followed the same model, for it didn't follow that same model. The story was engaging, it kept me coming back for more, and I feel Mr.Ishihama did a fantastic job writing the storyboard. I like the idea of humans forming mental powers, called cantus, that allow them to control their environment, but at the same time it feels like I'm watching a less technological version of Star Wars. As the plot built up from our main characters misadventures to complete all out war between sub species, I felt on edge a majority of the time. The alternate society starts out children out in various levels of schooling, but it is really only to control their cantus rather than educate them. The story itself revolves around the main cast as they move up and part ways, and how the school's committee finds ways to cast them out. After multiple failures by the committee, our main troupe is slowly split apart one by one through other circumstances. Like I said before, Mr. Ishihama did a fantastic job implementing a linear perspective. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, some episodes felt un-needed and it slowed the pace down at multiple points. In retrospect they seemed to serve a greater purpose. In the last few episodes everything stuck together quite nicely, and a lot of unclear histories were cleared up.\\n\\n\r\nI liked how the voice actors and characters seemed to fit their roles. The characters themselves, particularly the main cast, are thrown into a world and  are expected to fit into molds. The main cast is a particular group of interest to this society, and the society being various groups such as various organizations, elders and so forth. The society structure to me was particularly interesting because it's not all that different from modern structures. Rather than controlling children, we send them off to schools to socialize them. The real contrast here in Shinsekai Yori is controlling the children's abilities rather than educating them. I liked how each character had their own issues to work through; some of these issues were lacking in ability or possessing too much ability. If I had to pick a favorite character it would have to be Shun. It was interesting to see how his transformation was not noticeable by friends, but it was noticed early on by elders and his teachers. He was referred to as \"Karma Demon\" which twists and corrupts all around them.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, one major character aspect that threw me off were the same sex relationships that occurred in the story. It was really distracting to me because there isn't a clear explanation of the same sex relationships. It seems like it's something their schools implemented solely for bonding exercises, but it ultimately distracted me and felt like it didn't belong.\\n\\n\r\nOn the topic of characters, I wasn't very fond of the character animations. One point of distraction would be the oddly drawn faces. I didn't like the eye styles or the face structures very much. It took me some time to adjust, but in the end I became used to it.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation itself was good, not great, but good. combined with eerie instrumentals it made it a supernatural experience. However, the animation seemed very low budget. I've always liked the high end budget animation, but it didn't bother me at all. At some points it didn't flow very well, and you might have been able to see how stretched the animation budget was. \\n\\n\r\nThe music compositions that were chosen fit very well, and I liked them. It gave chilled feelings at some perfect moments. I loved the ending theme that was performed by Taneda, Risa. It felt like the first theme was designed to lift of tension, and the second was made to build up even more tension. Some of the voice actors were new, but they did a good job in their respective roles. I look forward to hearing from some of these first time voice actors in the future.\\n\\n\r\nShinsekai Yori is definitely a title that brings you a surreal, supernatural experience. It is a series you shouldn't judge until it is finished.",

            "content": "From the New World is set in a post-apocalyptic future where there is an apparent utopian society with psychics until a group of children come to learn that things aren't as they seem on the surface with their so-called utopia. The series delves into corrupt elements of the human condition in regards to the measures that the society in this series go through to maintain their so-called perfect society that involve questionable elements such as genetic manipulation, brainwashing and \"purging\" children who don't conform to the standards laid out by the village. The series takes its time to unveil more elements to its history andworld that lead Saki and her friends to continue further questioning the ethical and moral ramifications in regards to how things came about in their present time through a period of twenty-plus years as events escalate throughout the series. It is effective at building up events and creating suspenseful moments whenever Saki and others get into any dangerous situations involving mutants or other psychics.\\n\\n\r\nWhile having a nice amount of plot buildup and world exploration, it does have its issues that keep me from wanting to rate it higher. A number of points in the series rely fairly heavily on exposition in order to reveal more about the true nature of elements to its world and history, which often take up a decent chunk of episode time. While necessary in understanding more about the title's plot and world, it can be taxing to less attentive viewers who hate this style of storytelling and want more \"show, not tell\" with their anime. Character depth and development is rather limited in the series as it is more focused on its plot and world exploration meaning much of the cast doesn't have much dimension to their personalities nor do we get enough focus at many points on character relationships to connect with them, especially with any romantic developments that Saki gets entangled with during the different time skips in the show. If you're expecting solid character depth with your anime, you might be disappointed with that particular aspect for From the New World.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, From the New World's animation is.... avant-garde, as one way of putting it. The series makes use of different visual styles during tense points in its storytelling to enhance the haunting and dark aspects of its storyline, particularly in exploring the events that led to its present time and a number of the grotesque, horrific creatures that are encountered. During these points, the animation can be at its best showing unique designs with the mentioned creatures and seeing Saki and other psychics show off their powers during heated moments. However, there are points where the animation quality can take a hit with jerky animation and drawing errors in character designs.\\n\\n\r\nWhile a decent series, I do think From the New World may be a bit overhyped in folks laying claim to it as one of the best titles that came out for 2012 and 2013. The plot buildup and world building are solid in execution, though character focus is limited and there are points where the series can get a little too heavy on exposition from its cast to reveal more to its story. Still, it does do well enough in sticking out from many recent anime offerings with what it has to offer.",

            "content": "Full disclosure: in describing some elements of the series I necessarily make use of specific examples from the series, and therefore the reader should be forewarned of spoilers.\r\n\"[People are] forgetful that they themselves perhaps tolerate...inequalities under a mistaken notion of expediency, the correction of which would make that which they approve seem quite as monstrous as what they have at last learnt to condemn.\" - John Stuart Mill\r\nShinsekai Yori is an engrossing tale that merges the intimacies of a coming-of-age story with the grander narrative of a future society molded by the necessities of humanity\u2019s new powers.\r\nIn the future, every member of society is telekinetic.It is more than being able to move large objects with their minds: humans are able to affect the subtle structure of the world around them with subconscious desire.  It is a level of control over our surroundings that far surpasses anything humanity has ever experienced.  On the surface this sounds like a utopia, for humans no longer need fear the world around them.  However, this immense Power has brought forth a terrifying reality: humanity\u2019s greatest threat is now itself.\\n\\n\r\nThe strange truth is that the description I gave above is surprisingly close to the current state of affairs for humans in developed nations.  Almost all of our stress and want come from the actions of other human beings, not the environment.  If we lack it is not because of the inability to provide, and more than ever our fate is in our own hands.  This verisimilitude to our current state is what allows SSY to surpass being a simple supernatural-themed series about telekinetic children and cut to the heart of what makes society tick when it moves beyond the subsistence level. \\n\\n\r\nThe Good:\\n\\n\r\nThe strongest parts, if it was not already made clear, are the setting and exploration of themes using this futuristic society as a model.  It is world building at its finest, taking real principles and exploring their implications in a novel setting.\\n\\n\r\nForemost, there is the moral logic behind their community.  Killing children is generally considered wrong.  Yet early on we are presented with a situation in which this society watches them so closely, and judges their actions so harshly, that they can be disposed of on the basis of seemingly minor transgressions.  How is it that this \u201cadvanced\u201d society can see this as justifiable in any way?\\n\\n\r\nTo understand, we must take a step back and examine morality in light of human society.  In biology, cooperation is a delicate balance between self-interest and group wellbeing.  Humans are no exception to this.  We give up some of the autonomy of living singly for the benefits of living socially.  Our moral structure reflects this, with a mixture of individual and group values that are often in conflict with one another.  Our modern concept of \u201crights\u201d is an attempt to formalize the line which societies cannot cross; rules of thumb rather than laws of nature. \\n\\n\r\nIn our 21st century democracies we have come to prize individualism more than any other group of humans in history.  We have this luxury due to the immense improvements science and technology have wrought; there is little need for any of us to sacrifice to ensure the whole survives.  But this was not always the case.  In tribal cultures, infanticide is commonplace.  This isn\u2019t due to callousness or misguided superstition.  It is a response to necessity: if the tribe cannot support more people, then it risks starvation by supporting too many mouths that cannot feed themselves.  The needs of the whole must outweigh those of a single life, regardless of what \u201crights\u201d they have.\\n\\n\r\nThe world of SSY bears a greater resemblance to the tribal condition than our own.  In this situation a single child with dubious qualities may result in a catastrophe.  Even a single failure can result in the annihilation of their society.  It is a risk that their own history has shown is not worth taking.  As repugnant as their behaviors seem to us, there is a strong justification for why it must be the way it is.  It is we, as 21st century viewers, who are misguided by our long acquaintance with individualism.  For the elders to pursue a sort of hopeful carelessness, praying that the worst does not happen, is far more inexcusable than the policies they pursue.\\n\\n\r\nThe presentation of this moral structure is another of SSY\u2019s strengths.  The narrative pursues a purposeful misrepresentation of the situation through the eyes of the children.  We are so easy to trick, falling into the trap that surely the children must be the ones in the right.  After all, who doesn\u2019t assume the little trip up the river, beyond the barrier, was nothing more than harmless fun?  Or that when the censorship of the past is discovered, that it was clearly unnecessary and malign?  And of course, we are all hoping that Maria and Mamoru escape the town and live happily, away from the vile clutches of the Education Committee.\\n\\n\r\nYet as it becomes clear later: these events are what directly led to Shun\u2019s mental disintegration, the Monster Rat rebellion, and the Messiah fiend.  The adolescents, rather than seeing things in a clearer fashion, were dangerously ignorant of their world.  Their well-intentioned fumbling was the catalyst for disaster.  It was a testament to the quality of the series that it causes us to sympathize with the protagonists while having them in the wrong.  However, blended with the true faults of the society (its dehumanization of the Monster Rats, the miscalculations on the part of the committee) it is not a simple message about trusting authority, but a more nuanced insight into what drives them to do what they do.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, I want to end this section with a tribute to my favorite character of the series: Squealer.  Squealer is not a likable character.  His appearance is unattractive.  His behaviors are a mixture of servile groveling, cowardice, and vindictive anger.  Even his name is pejorative.  Clearly he is inferior, we think.  And yet, just like how we are misled about the nature of the society, so are we placated easily by our assured superiority.\\n\\n\r\nSquealer is both intelligent and cunning.  He is not a brave warrior like Kiroumaru, but a driven and idealistic rebel who cares deeply about his cause.  More disturbing to us, his beliefs are not without merit: he and his race are subject to gross inequalities, both under their own queens and the lordly \u201ctrue\u201d humans.  Seizing the opportunity presented to him, Squealer hoped to better the lot of all Monster Rats.\\n\\n\r\nI do not seek to justify his terror tactics.  Like many revolutionaries before him, he views the potential good of his cause outweighing any evil done in its name.  However, the desperation of his situation and the power of his arguments cannot be ignored.  In one of the best scenes of the series, Saki asks him to apologize for all the deaths he was responsible for.  His retort is simple: he will happily apologize, if only she will apologize first for treating his kin like chaff.  The scene ends with no response.\\n\\n\r\nThe Bad:\\n\\n\r\nAs excellent as Shinsekai Yori is, it has a couple noteworthy flaws.  The first is the overall quality of the animation, which noticeably dips on several occasions (the backgrounds remain striking, however).  Episode 5 in particular looks to be done by a different studio, and is frustratingly incongruous with the rest of the series.  However, I don\u2019t wish to spend too much time haranguing on this; it simply makes me a little sad that SSY wasn\u2019t given a better treatment.\\n\\n\r\nThere are also plot points that feel slightly forced for the sake of the overall story.  Many of these occur in the early episodes of the series while the children are stuck in the wilderness.  I was incredulous about the ease with which they gained access to the wandering library, bypassing all regulations by the simplest of threats.  The explanation as to how the children got all their powers back was equally convenient.  Finally, the odd menagerie of mutants and technology (gas pumps) that the Monster Rats had access to seemed out of place.\\n\\n\r\nThe Tokyo segment also has a distinct sense of being unnecessary.  While it does give an opportunity to become more acquainted with Kiroumaru, the series could have resolved just as effectively by remaining in Kamisu 66.  Overall it felt like more of a detour than a natural progression of the plot.  This and other parts don\u2019t individually sink the series, but it does make it feel flimsy at certain points.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, despite these shortcomings SSY is a marvelous piece that seamlessly links intriguing concepts of social morality with a harrowing story of children growing up in this brave new world.",

If this intro was enough to intrigue youthen read no further(Go watch the show XD), but for those who are still not convinced then allow me to try to explain why this hidden gem of an anime is worth your precious time.\\n\r\nPlot:\\n\r\nShinsekai Yori is a tale set in a dystopian future, from the beginning its vibrant scenery and beautiful colors might suggest otherwise, however this is nothing more than a trap to trick the viewer. Shinsekai is masterful at being subtle, its expertise at giving you a false sense of security is so great that at the beginning this show almost seemed to be an alternative slice of life and nothing else. Unlike other shows of its kind such as psycho-pass, Shinsekai Yori has a slow but worthy build up. Through its multiple time skips you can slowly see how dark this universe and it's dark secrets slowly creeps out.\\n\\n\r\nThis futuristic Japan is a brutal one, a world in which its government supports various deranged acts such as stripping the human rights of children until they reach the age of 17 or even worse how they act as if child murder is a necessity in order to prevent chaos. The government which is ironically known as the \"ethics committee\" is everything but ethical. However even with their monstrous acts you can't really hate them, as horrible as they act even as a observer you can sympathize with them. The adults themselves believe that their actions are righteous, being controlled by their fear of children turning into \" Karma demons\" and being able to defy the death feedback mechanism(mechanism which stops humans from killing each other) it seems that their actions are nothing but logical. As Edmund Burke said \u201cThose who don't know history, are bound to repeat it.\" With this flawed belief system they do various atrocities basely on suspicion.\\n\\n\r\nBut lastly the main conflict and best conflict is the one found within the mole rats and the humans. I'll not go into too much detail apart from saying that the ending of this show is one of the most demoralizing and bittersweet ending I have ever witnessed.\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\nThe Art is splendid, its vibrant and exciting colors help to set a mysterious atmosphere to this future world. One of the best things about the art is that it remains vivid and colorful even within moments of great despair, it almost seem incongruous the moment, however I believe this is great as it keep the observer such as myself in confusion.\\n\\n\r\nI could go on and on about its unique beauty but to keep it short let's just say that it's nothing short than amazing.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nNot to many tracks are found within its OST, but shinsekai yori helps us to remember the simple saying that it's quality over quantity. The tracks that it does have to offer are simply amazing. By now you must be thinking that I sound like a crazed fan boy but trust me this anime is just this good. It's tracks can range from calming to ominous and strange, the use of a choir in one said track is amazing.\\n\\n\r\nIn Other Words, nearly damn flawless.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nI have some issues but nothing major. Due to a lot of characters being present not all of them are fleshed out but this isn\u2019t a major issue. \\n\\n\r\nThe main characters of Saki, Satorou and Squealer are more than enough to bring depth into this story.\\n\\n\r\nBut the one that truly steals the show is Squealer, in the beginning you will hate him, but at the end of this show you'll ask yourself this one question.\\n\r\n- \" Was Squealer really all that bad\"-\\n\r\nI haven't seem an antagonist this good for a while, I mean most antagonist in this day and age seem to follow that certain stereotype of being all evil but even though it seems that squealer follows that same archetype by the very end I can assure you that just like myself you will sympathize with him. Once again showing how good this show is at the art of subtlety.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nIt has a slow build up as I said before but it's worth it \\n\\n\r\nP.S- It has a few yaoi and yuri scenes but that\u2019s nothing to get worked up over as it doesn\u2019t take away from it's magnificent plot.\\n\\n\r\nOverall \\n\r\nPlot 10/10\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nCharacters 8/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10.\\n\\n\r\n= 96/100\\n\\n\r\nIn essence a 10 out of 10, nothing short of a masterpiece.\\n",

            "content": "I have just finished this anime and I am completely amazed. To begin with this, I will say that by watching the first episodes I thought it would be very boring, but fortunately I was wrong. In this review I will talk only about the story and the characters, the rest will have a brief opinion.\r\nIf I start thinking about the season on which Shinsekai yori was premiered (fall 2012), I understand why it wasn't very known. In the same season of animes like Sakurasou, Psycho-Pass, JoJo, Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun or same too the second part of SAO, it was too difficult to this animeto be one of the most watched. And it is the same that happened to me. \\n\\n\r\n[WARNING! From now on, there might be some small spoilers. However, they have almost no impact on the importance of history].\\n\\n\r\nThe story is set 1000 years in the future. You could think that in that age, everything would be technological. But not. In replace of that \"modern\" age, there are few villages of (of course) few inhabitants. The lifestyle seems to be older than new. The humans in this age have a power called \"Cantus\", also known as PK (Psychokinesis). The kids who awaken that power, are able to go to the school, where they learn to master their PK. \\n\\n\r\nThe main characters are Watanabe Saki (the most important) and her friends. Throughout the series, we can see how the students are advancing on their handling of the Cantus. The, maybe, first four episodes, may seem slow and boring. As we know, it is one of the reasons why the majority leave an anime. But I recommend you not do that. \\n\\n\r\nSaki and her friends: Satoru, Maria, Mamoru and Shun, belong to the \"group one\" of the school and they are very close. There was also a 6th member, a girl called Amano Reiko, but she disappears in the first episode and then she is forgotten. This is not the only disappearement of a kid, and it is the reason why the characters start searching why is that happening in the villages.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the kids don't know many things about the world in which they are living. Later, as they grow, they change their way of thinking and this is what starts to make Shinsekai yori much more interesting, as they discover things which even the spectators didn't expect. \\n\\n\r\nThe variety of the characters (not only humans) throughout the series, the development and the evolving of them, and how the story is estructured to get to the end, is what makes this anime unique and what sets it apart from the rest even in its genre and in general. \\n\\n\r\nAbout the animation, in some episodes you will note a difference in the way of drawing. Don't worry because it is only happen on two or three episodes. The animation is excepcional in my opinion, and have an incredible art style, that it is difficult to find in any other anime. The backgrounds are beautiful and you can see the picturesque of the villages. The choice of the colors are set perfectly, and make the characters to have an unique design. Although, as I said, it lose (or change) the quality in some episodes, that is not a problem.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is also very good. Even though there is opening only in the episode 16 (which is also the second ending), the OST make you forget about that and you will definitely enjoy to watch the series while you are listening it because it is set in the perfect moment. The two endings are good too. Personally, the first called \"Wareta Ringo\" by Risa Taneda (seiyuu of Watanabe Saki) liked me so much that made me not to skip it in any episode.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed Shinsekai yori much more than I expected. I am not a fan of the mystery and horror genres, but it is worth watching. The series describes in a perfect way the human nature, and ignoring the science fiction, the story raised may be the reality, because it does not differ from the true way of thinking of the humans and how they (and we) think that they are the only species in the world that matters. \\n\\n\r\nI can consider it as a masterpiece, although not one of my favourites. I personally think that give a 10 to some anime, does not make it as one of your favourites. But I recognize that is an anime well achieved and it worth to be watched by everyone.",

Came across it in mal when I was checking the ratings of Psycho Pass and the page said Shinsekai Yori was similar to it. It is not entirely wrong, but the worlds portrayed are completely different.\r\nThis is an anime which considers what would've happened to human beings if some were born with special powers and some weren't. That's the basic premise of the story. What makes the anime awesome is the way the author has built the world around this fact and told the story based on the premise.Living in a world where classification has become its very basis, things portrayed in this anime are very much in sync with whats happening. It raises a lot of questions about nature of human beings and the system that is in place in the world in which they live.\\n\\n\r\nHaving said all that I'm giving the story 8 out of 10 as the sory telling could've been much better. Lot of things happen for which an explanation is conveniently overlooked. If they had done that, it would've been one of the best in the list of science-fiction anime set in a dystopian world. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and music are certainly praiseworthy as they never feel out of place.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I had fun watching this.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Starting this series, I was pretty skeptical because it was not my usual genre and I feared that I would not enjoy it. Starting off, I was not enjoying myself. Watching the series was basically a chore that I had to finish. Hitting episode 10, I stopped watching. I did not completely remove this from my list, but I just couldn't handle it. Like how most people have heard, there are some yaoi/yuri scenes that I was not a huge fan of seeing in an anime. I'm not against that, but it was weird to watch since it's not something I'm used to. But, therearen't many at all and are only seen in the first half of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe series ended a few days ago. With new series coming in the spring, I wanted to clear my anime list and have it fresh with new anime. When I reached Shinsekai Yori, I decided to finish it. I am so glad that I made that decision. This anime evoked so many emotions all at once. I have not felt this way about an anime in a while, but it made me feel so good, so bad, so sad, everything throughout the series. I believe that I was not enjoying it as much as I should have because I was watching it one episode at a time and it seemed like it was going at such a slow pace. I think it was my problem that I need to marathon a series to get the whole feeling that the creators are trying to give you. Basically, this series gave me the feeling that I love after watching a great series. it does not happen all that much with a lot of anime. For me, a perfect anime is one that gives me chills down my spine, and a lovely feeling throughout my mind and body. This fits that bar perfectly. It's hard to express what I truly want to say about this, but I think that it is worth giving a chance. Don't refuse to watch it after hearing a few bad reviews, or not liking the genre. This anime can teach you so much about values, and life and will keep you on your toes the whole time you watch it.\\n\\n\r\nFor those who care about this, the art style is extremely vibrant and artistic. It uses the perfect colors at perfect time to help express the emotions that one should feel during a scene, and shows the beautiful yet horrid world the anime takes place.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is strong and fits just as well as the animation. There are a few base songs played throughout that bring you back to the previous episodes thus evoking emotion by creating a comparison between the two events. That may be hard to understand, but you would if you watch the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were all so different and inspiring. I loved the main character so much. She seemed to be a bad one at first, but as it progresses, she grows into a respectable, strong, caring person who I have fallen in love with.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed this series. As I've previously stated, it evoked all the emotions that I love feeling when watching an anime. It sends chills down my spines for being so perfect. I would not pass this anime up for dumb reasons. Give it a chance. Don't quit half way like I almost did, because I assure you, you may find something that you wouldn't believe to find from this anime.",

            "content": "I've never felt as uncomfortable after finishing a show as I am now, after finishing Shinsekai Yori. The show makes you look inward; it makes you evaluate what you think is right and what is wrong. And it did so in a way I wasn't expecting. Whether by design or unintentionally, the show manages to put some of the main dilemmas right in front of you, while simultaneously distracting you with seemingly more important events. Shinsekai Yori has quite a bit of mystery to it, and this mystery is constantly driving the story. It's suspenseful at times, its sad at times, and more than notits thought provoking.\\n\\n\r\n*There will be some minor spoilers in this next section, but I will try to keep them to a minimum*\\n\\n\r\nThe reason I only rated this show an 8, is perhaps a result not of the show's quality, but of my own uneasiness. Character is important to me in any story. The main character of  the show, Saki, is excellent. Perhaps one of my favorite characters of any show I've watched. But several of the other characters don't come across well to me (which may be intentional). It can be hard to understand the motivations of the \"adults\" in the story; however I'm willing to give that a pass because of the dystopian world in which they live and were raised in. However Satoru poses a bit of a problem for me, though only at the end of the story. By the end of the story I was in agreement with the antagonists of the story. Saki seemed to share the same misgivings I did every step of the way. But Satoru...after everything Satoru endured with Saki, he seemed to be stuck in an old way of thinking. The story ended on a positive note, but it took a major revelation for Satoru's character to reach a point that I felt he should've reached even without the major revelation.\\n\\n\r\n Shinsekai Yori is a wonderful story, but I wouldn't say it is a happy story. The plot and the questions contained within, are not something you can find in many anime. The story is meant for a more mature audience, and if you want something that's a little more than mindless fun then Shinsekai Yori is probably for you.",

            "content": "Story:\r\nThe quality of the storytelling is excellent, yet bobs and weaves at some points during the plot. The story is competently told, almost expertly at times, but some episodes just don't fit with the flow of the series, and other episodes have their story stretched over multiple episodes in a lengthy and completely out of place manner. Most of the issues with storytelling occur as the series is wrapping up. The last few episodes take up an inappropriate amount of time to unfold the plot and the storytelling at this point gets a little clumsy. This occurs once or twice before in individual episodes. Theoverall plot of the show is unique, complex, and thought provoking, and thankfully does not fatigue the watcher by the end. The show takes some interesting looks at complex issues in a mature manner that very few anime, or pieces of media in general, succeed in doing. The ending is satisfying, while leaving a few questions annoyingly unanswered, and the journey there is great.\\n\\n\r\nThere was one plot element in the story that felt out of place which has to do with the sexuality of the characters and how sexuality is handled in their society. This element attracted some controversy with some saying that it was included for fan service purposes. In defense of the creators, I believe that they handled this plot element quite well. The episodes that heavily featured this \"sexuality\" element were handled maturely and these episodes felt as if the writers were exploring the world and the characters as they underwent puberty instead of providing blatant fan service. However, looking back, I find the inclusion of this plot element bizarre as it never seemed relevant in any other part of the plot. It seemed to serve little purpose than giving flavor to the world, which it indeed achieved in doing. But considering its heavy emphasis in the series, it felt like there should have been more purpose for it. On the other hand, I believe that this element did provide for a stronger bond between characters.\\n\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nOne of the things I enjoyed the most about this series was the art. Both the beautiful scenery and terrific character designs contributed to, and fit in with, the overall mood of the series. The designs of the characters and monsters were well done and nice to look at. The animation takes some dips throughout the series, but none of it is unwatchable. The art style, scenery, and character designs were all great and contributed to the series.\\n\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe sound direction in Shinsekai Yori is one of its greatest features. The voice actors fit perfectly with every character and one voice never took me out of the experience. The sound track is especially well executed and does wonders to evoke emotion in many scenes. This series does not feature an opening song, a stylistic choice that feels appropriate considering the different moods presented in each episode. It would be difficult to match each episode with a fitting opening. One episode, however, did feature an opening song. This was a clever device used to introduce background information for two of the main characters which was essential for the episode to work. While the series lacks an opening song, it makes up for any drawbacks with two fantastic EDs. The ending that accompanied the first half of the series was excellently done in both visuals and audio. It provided the perfect ending for each episode. The ED for the second half of the series was well done but not nearly as memorable or as accentuating as the first ED.\\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nI am mixed in my critique of Shinsekai Yori's characters. On one hand, I sincerely enjoyed each of the characters. On the other hand, they never achieved true growth within the story. While more than generic cardboard cutout characters, the characters were not completely 3d, but rather caught in a 2.5d limbo. Many may consider this a bad thing, but the characters were rather fleshed out and fit their roles well. They behaved, for the most part, in a consistent manner and moved along nicely in the plot. While I would have liked for some more interaction between the characters and some more character introspection, the creators did a good job in making some relatable and likable characters. The characters work in the story, and I really liked each of them.\\n\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nOther:\\n\\n\r\nIn this section I will discuss episode 5. This episode was a complete embarrassment to the series, and as such I have excluded it from evaluation. Episode 5 had a guest director who changed the art, story, and sound direction completely. The art style completely changes and left me, and many other viewers, baffled for a while. The mood and tone shift from the new art style startled me and completely took me out of the experience. The art wasn't bad, but just didn't fit with the mood set by the previous episodes. The director fumbled with the plot and took the characters out of their roles, changing Saki from a level-headed 12 year old girl to a clumsy dumb preteen. This episode truly is baffling and makes me wonder if the show's creators reviewed it at all before releasing it. Moral of the story: never let another director jack your story.\\n\\n\r\nI truly consider this to be one of the best shows I have ever seen. It competently tells a complex story with solid characters and great art and sound direction. I want to give Shinsekai Yori a 10, but it has some flaws that warrant giving it a 9. This series is a truly enjoyable and complex work.\\n",

            "content": "WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD\r\nI have to admit, I heard a lot about Shinsekai Yori.\r\nI heard that it was a seemingly slow anime with massive plot twists in the last few episodes; given the show's high rating, I was prepared to have my mind blown. But the show's big revelation wasn't really that big, and I came out feeling very underwhelmed.\r\nThe \"big moment\" of the show, learning that the queerats were in fact descendants of the non-Cantus-using humans, was hinted at in the show ever since the capture of the false minoshiro. Ever since we heard about the Cantus users and non-Cantus users, I suspected that thequeerats were the twisted descendants of non-Cantus users. I figured that the big plot twist at the end had to be something else, because queerats being genetically altered humans was a well-hinted twist that most people should be able to figure out. Up until the last few seconds of Episode 25, I kept waiting for something...more out of this hyped-up anime. But it never delivered.\\n\r\nThe twist also matters little; so what if the queerats are descended from humans? This doesn't affect any of the characters, and the only purpose of the twist is to garner sympathy for the queerats and their crimes. It didn't even do that for me; in fact, it did the opposite. If this twist was necessary to make the queerats not solely antagonists, doesn't this mean that the only reason we should feel sympathy for the queerats is because they were once human? This goes against the anti-racist theme the show was trying to create here, showing that hatred against the queerats was horrible as they were the same as humans. Had the queerats been just intelligently evolved naked mole rats, we wouldn't feel sympathy for them; they would just be the creatures who killed everyone. \\n\\n\r\ntl;dr: The show is alright if you don't go into it with very high expectations; the twist isn't that big and the show isn't that deep.",

            "content": "Ok I am going to start this by saying this is spoiler free, so if you are looking for reasons to watch this anime without having any problems, this is the place to be. Also hands down this is the best dystopian story I have seen, whether it be through movies or tv shows.\r\nStory:10- First i would like to say i will not give you a synopsis (just bare bones of what you are getting yourself into) you can find that somewhere else. This show is very complicated and you are thrown a vast amount of information in one of the first few episodes. Thismay make you believe that this is a strong example of a plot hole filled anime, but man you would be wrong. All the questions that you ask throughout this anime are answered by the end with mouth dropping results. Another thing about this plot is that it keeps you guessing, trying to predict what happens next but you wont find it. This show is anything but predictable and takes you on a long journey over 25 good episodes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:10- Ok so here i will not give you the entire cast of amazing characters, but i will give you the best of the main five you will meet in the beginning.  Out of the main five the only ones that i found interesting was Saki who is the protagonist who you follow throughout the story. she is not generic but at the same time not very compelling. Next you have Satoru who seems to be the more bull headed and could be seen as the tactician. But where the characters really shine is with Squealer and Kiroumaru; i cant tell you why without spoiling, but they are the best part of the show when it comes to the character section.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation:8-  When it comes to this section i think that the art cant be judged because that is just your personal preference whether you enjoy it or not. For animation though i would say this was above average but definitely not the best i have seen. Their is good animation thoughout and i never saw a weak point in the series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: In my opinion this show was a high 9 but after you get all the questions answered you cant help to give it a 10. you get a great resolution that brings you a great understanding on how they got to this Utopian society. This show will keep you guessing and you will be 100% happy you watched it. But in the end i am a true believer that nothing is perfect and the place that i believe this show lacks is its pacing. at some points it can be a little slow but that is the only negative that i believe this show has.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n-Story is compelling\\n\r\n-Fantastic ending\\n\r\n-All questions are answered(no plot holes)\\n\r\n-Great character and lore behind the universe.\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-alittle slow paced\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Overall this show is a probably the best Utopian story out there that has fantastic characters, a story that is compelling, and a great resolve in the end to let you know how they got to where they are in the end. So basically what im saying is that i dont care who you are this is a must watch. So what are you still doing here go watch it.\\n\\n\r\nAlso thank you to everyone who took the time to read this review and have a great day!!",

Problem is the transitions were really bad and there were some unnecessary moments that were nothing but a waste of time.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe Art is very good and is an eye-candy to the viewer , the animation is absolutely bad , this is one of the laziest shows in the terms of animation I have ever seen , the blood split is PG-3  :/ . too much CG too that I was utterly disappointed .\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe Soundtracks are absolutely masterful and very memorable , this is one of the finer points in the show , but the problem lies in how utterly small the used soundtracks are.\\n\r\nThe Voice acting is not that special but not bad at all.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 7/10\\n\\n\r\nHuman characters are very meh , Saki is a Melodramatic character that bore the heck out of me at some point , Satoru and the tertiary characters were the characters I really cared about , The homo scenes were unnecessary , a lot of characters were unnecessary to the story , and they got a lot of screentime . \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyement 8/10\\n\\n\r\nIt would have been a 7/10 but let me just say that the final episode was what changed my mind to an 8 , maybe because I am stupid , even though I expected the ending I was very glad that that good ending was the one that concluded the story . This show is a rare case of the ending changes everything even though I didn't believe in this case once.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9 + 8 + 9 + 7 + 8) /5 = 8.2\\n\r\nCeiling 8.2 is a 9 \\n\\n\r\nso Overall it is a 9/10 (Great)",

            "content": "STORY\r\n  The story is no doubt is the best part of Shin Sekai Yori, since everything is crafted so carefully. Every element is needed, and yes even the more uncomfortable and shocking ones. (Ep. 8....) The themes of Shin Sekai Yori are themes that don't really get focus in anime, or movies. Except for daring few. \"Do us as humans have the right to be the controlling on Earth?\" and the most important, \"Have we humans actually changed as a over the many years?\" These are the questions make Shin Sekai Yori the roller coaster it is. It made me think about these themesthroughout the whole ride, and I think the story manages to open up my mind to these questions very well. But, everything isn't perfect. The anime had two time jumps that took me by surprise. There was information in that wasn't presented to the viewer, but rather told to us by Saki, and I really think that's a shame. Because once a plot twist happens and the conflict is over, they would skip over a couple years, and have Saki tell us the bits of what happens in between. But there is upsides to this. The time skips allow us as the viewer see how much the characters changed, after a few years. This is a very good tactic to make me care about the characters. It's kind of like seeing someone grow up. Seeing how certain events effected a character years later. By the end I really care for the characters, some more than others, but lets will deal with that later. I also found the pacing not for everyone. It can be very slow at times, and with the time jumps, it's pretty much all over the place. But, I strangely liked the pacing. It allowed different events in the story to flow in their own natural way. Instead of keeping one pace through out. So overall, I founded the story it told to be one of the most compelling stories I have ever seen.\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\r\n  While I was attached to the five main characters in one way or another, it's hard to say that most of them were stand out or great characters. This is because Shin Sekai Yori takes place all in Saki's point of view. Which means, we only see what she sees. Sometimes other characters might be off doing something else, and we wouldn't be able to see them. Some of these things might be important to their development, and we miss out. With that said, the only characters that get any \"good\" development are Saki and her friend Satoru. Out of the two, Saki is the only complex one. She's a great main character. She might be a bit plain at first glance, but really she's a strong female protagonist. She's not strong in a physical sense, but in the way that her choices effect those around her and the overall story. I also have to mention the villain. He's a villain that I hate, but I can understand why he acted the way he did. He's a character that I wanted to die, but in the end, I felt sorry and sort of related to him. The characters of Shin Sekai Yori aren't  stand out by any means, but for some reason I feel attached the main cast.\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\r\n   Animated by A-1 Pictures, Shin Sekai Yori's main weakness is the animation. Don't get me wrong, it looked visually pleasing to me during many moments. But, it's really average. The character movements aren't bad, but the show tries to use as many tricks as it can. To hide the low frame amount. The lighting is not that good. The show lacks shading and and highlights, which makes things look flat. The actual art on the other hand is very nice to look at. The clothes the characters wear are mixture of Japanese with another style. The characters designs are lacking in detail, but are simple and nice to look at. Though, this doesn't excuse bad animation. If I could describe the animation in one sentence, it would be this: Average with a few sprinkles here and there.\\n\r\nMUSIC\\n\r\n  Composed by Shigeo Komori, From the New world's sound track is all the round pretty good. There are many tracks that stand out and fit the show. It can be unsettling, somber, and soothing. Though, I'm not too keen on how reused it gets, but this is a small complaint. Aside from the background there's no opening, but 2 endings. Which are both amazing singles on their own. In particular the first ending song warata ringo. It's a joy to listen to, and I consider it to be one of my favorite endings. Overall the music, is wonderful and truly is worth to sit and listen to.\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\r\n  Really, I felt like the reason why I like this show so much is because of the connection I felt with the main character, Saki. I can see myself making the choices she made, and her journey is exceptional. Shin Sekai Yori is a unique  show that only certain people can enjoy. It's really worth watching, if you can take some of he daring themes it throws at you. It's no character piece, so it's really only for those looking for a great story.\\n",

Especially in the last episode, the whole mystery are answered, I find there is too much, too much significance on consecutive strikes, that I can not help wondering, thinking about them ...\r\nFantastic! That is the word I can comment on the content of this anime.\r\nCharacter : \r\nThe character designs were donevery well this stage, I think a bit difficult with them a bit, because what anime adaptation was not the Light Novel Novel or Visual Novel. Looking back cast, I see very clearly, and could see the look that realize part of their personality. Mamoru shyness, weakness shaped like daughter; Koufuu old bald look very rugged and somewhat insane; Shisei looks very cool, somewhat mysterious; Flood \"mouse\" U Linh Try at first glance looks pretty weird and scary ...\\n\r\nArt/Animation :\\n\r\nThis section is a highlight of the anime. Just in Movies, 66 Kamisu town was exuding tranquility of the countryside, the rivers, the trees, but it seems murky scary - especially when combined with the soundtrack, complete with an anime can horror, mystery.\\n\r\nInterestingly, the sky scene appeared in many episodes, with different markings, sometimes trying pm, purple, sometimes dark, murky, but also the clear, blue. .. depending on the context.\\n\r\nComplaint with the art exchange appears 2 times throughout the film. When I'm drunk with compelling content in the ep to ep 4 5 startled me with different art from the scene, the colors, the character, feeling very uncomfortable. From ep 6 onwards everything is back to its original; Sang ep 10 changed again.\\n\r\nSound :\\n\r\nAnime special, not only with OP ED, called \"Wareta Ringo\" (roughly translated: Apple corrupted) by Saki female (seiyuu Risa Taneda) shown. At first listen a bit harsh for electronic music, listen to gradually got used.\\n\r\nLast ED2 until ep 17 for a new furnace, called \"Yuki ni Saku Hana\"\\n\r\nI quite like this with warm bass tone through seiyuu voice Kana Hanazawa (as Maria), reminds me so much emotion\\n\r\nEnjoyment :\\n\r\nAs a favorite anime genre horror, mystery (Horror, Mystery), so I was not too difficult to attract SSY since the first ep.\\n\r\nOverall :\\n\r\nSSY is an anime content or transmit to the audience the message, meaning, think it deserves an award given in 2013\\n\\n",

            "content": "Shinsekai Yori (translated as \"From the New World\" is a science fiction anime series that follows the lives of five children in their small Japanese village.  Sounds simple, right?\r\nSTORY:  10/10\r\nLike mentioned in the premise, Shinsekai Yori is a sci-fi anime, and for good reason.  The setting of the story, while seemingly is feudal Japan, is actually 1000 years in the future.  The people of the \"new world\" have developed a psychokinetic power, called \"Cantus\", which has shaped the world in ways unimaginable.  SSY follows the five children as they attempt to piece together and uncover the horrific, dark secrets oftheir beautiful world.\\n\\n\r\nSSY's story is told in a way that never allows the viewer to ever \"relax\" in their world.  The viewer is always kept on edge because nothing is ever as it seems.  Almost every character other than five protagonists have an angle, and the characters are all monitored incredibly closely in their village.  It's the nature of their world.  The story is unique and very engaging.  I've noticed many say that nothing happens in the first three episodes.  While not much story-wise happens (it's mostly there to explain the terms of the world), each episode ends with a twist, including the first three.  In fact, of the nineteen that have aired, none have ended without something unexpected happening at the episode's conclusion.  All in all, the story captivates the viewer and keeps good pace through the series.\\n\\n\r\nART:  10/10\\n\r\nThe artwork in the first five episodes is incredible.  From then on, it somewhat varies but still maintains a very high level of detail.  The art style is definitely unique but never detracts from the experience.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:  10/10\\n\r\nThe music in SSY is phenomenal.  While the series takes place far into the future, the music is very reminiscent of something one would find in an anime series taking place in the past.  It fits well with the scenery and really does its job in building tension when needed.  This series features no opening sequence, but the first ending, \"Wareta Ringo\" by Risa Taneda, is one of the most beautiful and surreal songs I've ever heard (of course, the animation is also amazing).  Very high marks here.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:  10/10\\n\r\nSSY really shines here.  The series features two timeskips which means that we really do see the protagonists grow up and actually see the affects of the events around them on their personalities.  The series does a great job of portraying the reactions of the characters in a realistic way.  It's incredibly easy to relate to each character in one way or another, and even characters that are introduced for one or two episodes are given unique personalities.  Usually, these characters are killed off rather soon, only adding to the emotional aspect of the series.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:  10/10\\n\r\nShinsekai Yori's story is incredibly engaging and grapples the viewer after the fourth episode.  Each week leaves you wanting more and the 22 minutes or so go by in what feels like 5.  This is a really fun series to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL 10/10:\\n\r\nShinsekai Yori is truly a unique gem.  It is a science fiction anime in that the events in the series could, concievably, happen one day.  The initial poster for this series paints a picture of a beautiful world filled with happy people.  Viewers quickly realize that this isn't the case and is very far from it.  In a sense, this is also a horror anime not only because of the brutal, scathing history of the world, but also because the beautiful world potrayed is shattered very quickly, and its true nature is revealed.  In addition to that, it explore human psychology and development and even follows the progression of other species seeking to overthrow humans as the dominant species on earth.  \\n\\n\r\nIt's a gripping series that I must recommend to anyone interested.",

            "content": "Warning: spoilers ahead\r\nShinsekai Yori is hands down the best anime I have ever seen. I wish there was a score higher than 10/10 I could rate this. The only thing I found disappointing was the ending, simply because it didn\u2019t do what I wanted it to do (aka it was more sad than I had hoped). \r\nStory: 11/10\r\nThis is one of those stories that covers a long period of time. If I remember correctly, it covers ~24 years, from when the characters are 12 to when they\u2019re 36. It starts out kind of slow with hints and foreshadowing, but nothing too dark or dramatic. Infact, it\u2019s almost slice of life for the first two or three episodes, but then you realize that everything ties into the bigger story. The story\u2019s pace gets faster with each timeskip until finally you get to the queerat rebellion. This is the part of the show that made it hard to keep watching. There\u2019s so much death and despair and sadness that it became hard to watch after a while, although that\u2019s not a problem with the show. I\u2019d rather watch a depressing as fuck realistic anime than a fairy-tale version of war. But watching all the characters you\u2019ve grown to love dying off one by one was just flat out hard to watch. However, the complexity of the plot, the twists, the pacing, the realism, everything was just beautifully done. I could not have asked for more from this anime. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I really liked about this anime was the fact that almost every character came back. In the very beginning of the series we introduce a lot of characters. In most stories, these characters would serve their purpose and then exit the plot. But in Shinsekai Yori, they don\u2019t. For example, Squealer. At first it seems his only purpose is to guide the kids out of the caves and back to safety. After that we have a timeskip and focus on the kids and the school. Squealer exits the plot. But then, after you\u2019ve forgotten about him, he comes back and leads the queerat rebellion. It almost felt like I was reading a Clive Barker novel. That\u2019s why Maria disappearing and never coming back was so disappointing. Also I wanted Saki to be happy and get her lover back. This show is so cruel. \\n\\n\r\nOne more thing I\u2019d like to address: queerats are humans. This completely blew me away. I thought all the surprises were over, but then Satoru comes in and he\u2019s like \u201cyeah Saki, queerats are actually humans\u201d. It was so nicely done, especially since it was done at a time when you didn\u2019t see any more surprises coming. Looking back on it, there were hints here and there about it, but I wasn\u2019t paying enough attention.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9/10\\n\r\nAll of the characters in this show were interesting. We have a group of 5 kids, all of whom are different. Admittedly, some of them were kind of annoying (*cough* Mamoru *cough*), but none of them were dislikable enough to ruin the show for me. Even Squealer, despicable evil queerat though he was, became sympathetic in the end. Slightly. I mean, come on, nobody deserves what he went through. Our main character, Saki, is one of my favorite characters. She feels like an actual human being. She isn\u2019t invulnerable to hardships, but is strong enough to bounce back and be almost the same. All of the characters felt real. They all had flaws, but they were all strong in their own way as well. Except Mamoru. I\u2019m glad he exited the plot. The way the characters change and develop over the course of the story is extraordinary as well. Satoru seems to be that kid in school who\u2019s always looking for attention, gets bad grades, and seems to never mature. However, by the third timeskip, he\u2019s grown into a fully mature adult capable of making rational decisions. The writer of Shinsekai Yori has the ability to wrote both convincing children, adolescents, and adults, which is not an easy skill to master. Admittedly, some of the adolescent kids seemed to have the sex drive of 20 year old adults, but that wasn\u2019t enough to break my suspension of disbelief. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nNot much to say here. The character designs were very nice and I loved the simple art style. The characters themselves were drawn simply and colored simply, but they had a charm to them that made them not appear boring. The way the artist draws plant life and the outdoors was also really amazing, although that might just be me. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nThis show has an extremely wide variety of music. Sometimes it reminds me of Yuuki Yuuna (the choral tracks in particular), but other times it doesn\u2019t sound like anything else I\u2019ve heard before. All of the music fits the mood perfectly, serving to enhance the feelings of the characters and the atmosphere. It\u2019s the kind of music you could play for me and I\u2019d be like \u201coh hey, that\u2019s Shinsekai Yori music!\u201d The voice acting was good, and I can imagine how much fun it must have been for the voice actors who were cast as queerats (especially Squealer xD). This anime also knew when NOT to use music, or indeed sound of any kind. For example, in episode 24 when Saki and the other guy are going to find the Psychobuster and one of those sea monsters comes and eats him. During that whole scene there is no sound at all, and rather than taking away from the intensity of the scene, it serves to heighten it.\\n\\n\r\nYuri: 10/10\\n\r\nBecause who doesn\u2019t ship MariSaki? \\n\\n\r\nThere are very few times I feel comfortable using the word \u201cmasterpiece\u201d. However, Shinsekai Yori is one of those anime that I feel deserves that title. I have never watched an anime that was as good as this one was in terms of complexity, atmosphere, characters, and of course, the twists. Madoka is the only one that comes close. I\u2019m still upset that Saki didn\u2019t get her Maria back, but it seems she managed to get over it. Poor Saki... I recommend this anime to everybody (unless you can\u2019t handle exploding body parts and every character you love and cherish dying). \\n",

            "content": "This is my first review so I apologize if it's not up to par or runs on for too long! In addition to the anime review, I'll also be comparing the anime to the original novel.\r\nI was (kinda) introduced to Shinsekaiyori by my sister and the plot sounded interesting, so I decided to give the original novel a try. And I'm really glad I did, because it ended up being one of my favorite novels of all time. So naturally, I decided to give the anime a try as well, and I was not disappointed.\r\nThe thing that impressed me the most was how loyal theanime was to the original novel. The anime follows the novel exactly for the most part without cutting any important scenes or characters, and also without adding any unnecessary fillers. There was only one big scene involving two of the main characters that was cut (or rather heavily abbreviated) in the anime but this did not interfere with the flow of the story in the least. The pacing of the episodes was well done and the end of each always left you eager to find out what happens next. I was also pleased with the flashbacks at the beginning of some of the early episodes showing what happened over the course of 1000 years before the story begins. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is fantastic. Most of the characters and creatures appeared and sounded as I would've imagined from reading the novel. It was also a plus that some of my favorite seiyuus (Taniyama Kishou, Kaji Yuuki, Hanazawa Kana of course) were used! I guess at first I imagined the Bakenezumis to be a little \"cuter\" but I felt their design in the anime gave them more of an impact (especially Kiroumaru since I wasn't imagining him to be so tall) The scenery shots, especially the sunset shots, are breathtaking. The next time you hear Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's 9th symphony, the setting sun of Kamisu 66-chou is guaranteed to come to mind.\\n\\n\r\nOne factor that makes the story so great is how much it makes you think. Even though the story is obviously fiction, it does not eliminate the possibility that a similar scenario could happen in real life in the future. It makes you contemplate what measures a government might take in order to create the perfect society or \"utopia\". It makes you consider your sexuality, whether we as humans are truly no different from bonobos when we copulate for pleasure or to reduce stress. There are many philosophical themes hidden throughout the story that will keep your mind working as you learn about the dark, blood-stained history of the Shinsekaiyori world.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is also filled with a large number and variety of characters, both human and non-human. Each character has their own unique personality and significant role to the overlying plot. However, you may be disappointed if you become attached to a specific character as the author has no problem killing off characters, even if they only get one episode of screen time, but this only adds to the story's suspense. As the story progresses, we watch the characters as they grow, change, and gradually move down the paths that society has laid out for them. \\n\\n\r\nShinsekaiyori is one of the best stories I've ever read, and in turn one of the best anime I've ever watched. The art is fantastic, the voices and character designs are spot-on, and the story is so well written and thought out. Props to both the author Kishi Yuusuke and director Ishihama Masashi for bringing this brilliant work to life. A definite recommendation to any fans of the dystopian genre.\\n\\n\r\nP.S. Although I don't hate her, I do find the main character Saki to be quite annoying overall, and I think Taneda Risa did an astounding job in ensuring her annoyance in the anime as well.",

            "content": "Is the world we know as peaceful and bliss as we make it out to be? From the past, present, and undoubtedly the future the world we have known up until now is a much more complex soil then we had made it out to be while we were still in our naive youth. Our minds back then couldn't possibly or more so perhaps we try to cancel out the truth were told because we couldn't comprehend the darkness of what the world truly holds. However, once we've witnessed what the world around you truly holds, we are forced to comprehend it and begins theprocess of the change in ideals start to change in a more realist way rather then morally. As it accumulates as time passes time we have lost most of our morale and we ourselves become demons like the ones we've witness from our experiences. In the case of Shinsekai Yori, why not add psychokinetic kids in the meanwhile. Since I've wrecked the mood, let's start this review.\\n\\n\r\nShinsekai Yori follows six kids that possess extraordinary psychokinetic powers as the premise likes to call Cantis in a utopia set 1000 years from today. They go by the names of Saki Watanabe, Maria Akizuki, Sotaru Asahina, Mamoru Itou, Shun Aonuma, and Reiko amano. These kids are isolated from the rest of the world this utopia ruled by people who possess Cantis as well and they attend to their academy to train and practice their Cantis. However, these kids one day across something called a false Minoshiro. That day, they have discovered the dark history of the world they live in and experience it in the distant future.\\n\\n\r\nStory: The story itself had great potential to be one of the best anime there is with that wicked premise. It is portrayed to be seemingly original and is executed very well to bury myself deep within the soil of immersion it's world. Shinsekai yori has a heavy focus on convincing psychological point-of-views which is what us human fail to understand the circumstances of unequals like how we treat a different species and ironically, that species thinks well alike as humans as well as they do intellectually. The problems I have with the is that it has a few plot holes that need fixing like how Cantis was even possible and we received not enough info about it origin either and Death Feedback was just a warping vortex for holes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters are about the weakest part of the show next to animation which I'll get to in a sec. In all honestly, most of the characters are just plain bland and boring, but the least I can give is that the the characters close to Saki had some good subtlety to back them up I'll give them that much. Otherwise, they are just as interesting as dry wood in a deep forest. Saki was consistent as a character. Well for the plot anyways. Aside for that, she gets kind of dull after a while later. Overall, the cast are just plain mediocre.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Since no one gives a damn about SFX, I'll just skip straight into the OST. It fit in great within it's premise, but I did find the tracks to be repetitive at times. However, it's only a little pet peeve so myself considers just a scratch from a plastic knife. Besides, it definitely wasn't even in the measurements compared to Tetsuro Araki's works who repeats the same single OST for every episode.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: The art and designs are indeed creative and the background paintings look lively and fitting for the premise. However, i simply can't overlook the character design and the animation quality. every time when Saki looks at me with her eyes I get this feeling I'm being sucked in a bland orange space with a black hole in the middle. Also, there isn't any shading on the characters. What, is light flashing at them in every direction. The animation can be good at times but holy s*** I flipped many tables every time I see a catapulted CGI boulder. Nothing special about the animation, but the was decent at the least.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, Shinsekai Yori had a lot of potential, but the plot holes, characters, and the animation quality seem to get in the way of that significantly by a margin, but I won't go as far to say it was mediocre and not worth the watch. In all honesty, it a pretty good watch overall. Just isn't the best thing to come out of ever. If into the whole psychokinesis premise this is probably going to some fine oolong for you if you dig into this sort of stuff.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.5 / 10",

            "content": "Powerful, intricate and stunning this series completely came out of nowhere for me and made my jaw drop again and again. Shin Sekai Yori tells the story of Saki, a girl in a mysterious future where humans have developed telekinesis, but don't let that make you think its been done before, this series will take you to new places.\r\nWhat makes this anime so good? Firstly its the mood. It keeps this eerie surreal mood all the way through with an amazing soundtrack and stunning surreal imagery. This anime moves through a variety of emotions, it is heart wrenching, sometimes genuinely scary and it even hasits own kind of warmth but through it all it all is this beautiful ethereal quality that kept me watching and made me truly glad to have stumbled upon this series.\\n\r\nSecondly its the story. This isn't some written by the week manga (even though I like those); this story has been planned right down to the last episode, which I found to be immensely satisfying. The first episode will whet your appetite with hints at whats to come in the but don't be fooled, this anime becomes more complex and beautiful as the series goes on. It's one of those stories that just keeps surprising you and getting better.\\n\r\nIt's not a happy story, not for those moments when you want to feel good about the human condition but it neither is it indulgently sad; it has a hopeful tone about it.\\n\r\nBut I do feel I have to warn potential watchers about something. There was a point where I was concerned it might become an excuse for paedophillic fanservice, its NOT! It's definitely not that kind of show. It has a fairly awkward stage around about the time the characters are going through puberty, but just like puberty it is fleeting and well worth sticking out. You may even enjoy these few episodes as I read many comments of people who did.\\n\r\nAll in all this is one of the best anime I have watched in a while. If you feel like you are in the mood for the kind of anime with a mature and carefully written story that challenges you, or if you appreciate stylised imagery and a bit of subtlety in your anime then this would be a good anime to watch, I highly recommend it.",

            "content": "Shinsekai Yori is my favorite anime, however underrated, of the season.\r\nStory: 10\r\nThe story is the deal breaker for me in this particular anime. Although the first few episodes are lighthearted, the plot soon follows the foreshadowing in the beginning and  turns dark. After the first 10 episodes, a huge plot twist happens (I did not see it coming although others may have) and I've heard that there will be more.\r\nAt first, I was bored with the slow pacing but after four episodes, the story picked up and I was hooked.\r\nArt: 9\r\nThe art has ups and downs. A few episodes were done poorly but thegood ones (the majority) are outstanding. The style somewhat changes with the episode, which I understand because the story has a balance of dark and light moods, slice of life and suspense/action. I personally did not mind the occasional odd angle.\\n\r\nMy favorite part of the art is the backgrounds and landscapes, especially the surreal ones. They are amazing and utterly inspirational. The clothes and hairstyles constantly change and I applaud the studio for doing that.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nI'm not particularly picky with sound. It's good but not outstanding. Overall, the sound does a fine job of conveying the mood.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nThe main character Saki is not annoying. Character development exists and interactions seem real. Although the characters seem stereotypical in the beginning, the plot twists eventually break that. The main group is well designed and I was even able to remember their names by episode 5 (huge accomplishment for me and the anime).\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI cringed, I smiled, I cried. And I loved every moment of it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nI would rewatch. (Although we're only halfway through the series!)",

            "content": "I thought I have seen it all. If you peer through my list, you'll understand what I mean. For the moment it's 20 years of high-quality anime and 32 years of reading good books for me. So, I didn't have any expectations when I started to watch Shinsekai Yori. Okay: artwork pleasant to my eyes, nice voices, fine music, but then... I watched almost all the legendary series and movies. I hosted a Evangelion-themed forum in my early-to-mid twenties. I experienced nearly all mind-blowing and classic anime. I read a lot of sea-themed books, so I can see through almost all the allusions, hints andquotes in One Piece (I dropped it after the episode 595). Evangelion, all of GITS, Serial Experiments Lain, everything by Studio Ghibli, Cowboy Bebop, Last Exile (the original one, still my favorite), Hunter\u00d7Hunter (all of it) \u2014\u00a0you name it. I've seen it all. I've read a lot of books. I'm professional journalist, after all, I know a thing or two about stories.\\n\\n\r\nIs there any anime to amaze me after all that? Is there any anime that can teach me something? Hardly anymore, I thought, watching episode 1, 2, 3, 4 and so forth of Shinsekai Yori. Something made me watch it. In the middle of the series, it happened: a plot twist. Then another. Then another. Then more. By the 17th episode I could barely unglue myself from watching it even to get some sleep. That thing utterly captivated me. Intense action, unconventional and even uncanny plot twists and unravelings, layers within layers within layers... Some seemingly important (or just appealing) characters turned out to be just empty shells. Some characters that I personally wanted some future for, mercilessly removed. Someone who seems totally unimportant, grows into a central figure.\\n\\n\r\nOkay. I admit that the root of that story is an ethical dilemma that may seem pretty trivial. Yet, a speculative simplification like that can make a lot of classic masterpieces (be them anime, motion pictures, theatrical shows or literature) seem too basic to worth any praise, let alone the effort of creation. Also, getting to that root requires you to watch the series from the beginning to the very, very end, not missing a word.\\n\\n\r\nEven if Shinsekai Yori couldn't boast with anything but a plot itself (off with graphics, music, voices, suitably deep characters and many other things that make anime something we all like it for), it would still be a 10/10 masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nIt is not flawless, of course... but in the end, nothing is flawless and off with that too. \\n\\n\r\nJust watch it. If you are an adult and have a teenager around, make him or her watch it. If you think you've seen it all \u2014\u00a0watch it. If you are bored \u2014\u00a0watch it.\\n\\n\r\nAh, yes \u2014\u00a0don't forget to learn from it. This thing is really educational, it makes you think.",

            "content": "Shinsekai Yori contains the most powerful story anime has ever told.\r\nThis review will be less about what facets of the anime I feel are excellent or flawed, and more about how my lifetime has led me to interact with the human process of storytelling.\r\nI have been watching anime since I was a child, from sneaking out of bed to catch each week's Detective Conan on Adult Swim, the mature and shonen animes on old Toonami, to having a computer of my own in my teenage years and relentlessly consuming all kinds of anime. At 21, I have invested in thousands of stories, shows, and books.I understand when I enjoy an anime for being a guilty pleasure, for being overpopular but underrated in quality, I've had my phases of Death Note and Code Geass and arthouse projects like Genius Party and Serial Experiments Lain. I appreciated NGE, I've appreciated a lot of stories.\\n\\n\r\nFor music, for anime, for anything, I have never been a person to have a favorite. It seems impossible for my mind to weigh the emotional reactions stories have gotten out of me and rank them. I can accept that I had a stronger connection to characters but noticed flaws in screenplay or motivations. I can accept many of the flaws in every show and suspend disbelief to enjoy or analyze the message that is being communicated to me by a work. I have not discriminated against any anime that used fluff to hook viewers while trying to tell an incredible story. I have not favored greatly any anime that had a poor or rehashed story but still drew me, particularly, in. I have seen nearly everything, so even shows that surprise me even still do not qualify as remarkable qualities for a favorite, because I will be surprised again, and surprises by nature do not mean much.\\n\\n\r\nI did not know what kind of show I would be getting with Shinsekai Yori, but I did eventually realize I was following a dystopian setting and its characters along. I noticed along the way that these characters were being portrayed very honestly, and the story was being told in such a way that I would have to appreciate worldbuilding, I would have to appreciate character growth, and I would get to enjoy a few twists and reveals. All elements that capture attention.\\n\\n\r\nOn the path to all this, it is hard to put an anime on a pedestal simply for following what are good steps for a great story. It is hard to justify putting an anime on a pedestal for going beyond that and reaching me emotionally with its great story. But something here, about the entirety of this show is remarkably praiseworthy. I can't say that on almost everything it was executed perfectly, and I can't guarantee that the experience I had watching it was the same powerful experience everyone will have, given the context of their lives or what things they may notice in the show that will tug at the ego and create a critical frown. \\n\\n\r\nI can only tell you that for someone who has lived a life swallowed up in stories that I do not live and never will, who enjoys being drawn into fantasy and being consumed whole by it, Shinsekai Yori is the most incredible thing that this medium has ever delivered. I look at Cowboy Bebop, I look at the Studio Ghibli classics, any other top title you may have seen and after having watched this decide that was better, I understand. Many shows have an irreplaceable, unique charm, and a fresh take that may resonate strongly with people. I cannot pick a favorite, I will tell you that Shinsekai Yori has its own unique charm. It has created its own fresh take, it has not managed to disillusion me with any of its characters or its storytelling devices.\\n\\n\r\nI do not feel as if Shinsekai Yori is pushing agenda or narcissism onto me, in a very innocent way it is simply delivering many messages that are up to you to prioritize. It does not seem to come from an imagination that has motives or takes sides. It possesses the honest delivery of people, places, and events that are required to tell a story. It is unfailingly impressive at provoking deep emotions, and it is uniquely impressive at provoking questions that can be very hurtful, circumstances that can be so gruesomely true when translated into philosophical questions that you may desire to think on it quickly and move on to watching the following events on screen out of fear that these questions will penetrate too deeply. It has that ability.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime will be my favorite anime from now until the end of the medium. I was not planning on deciding anything like this before I watched it or even getting close to the climax. But when I thought of what I liked and what I did not like, it was so muddled to me how to rank this show that I think if there is anything that can be called a favorite it must be the most unique thing you have ever encountered. \\n\\n\r\nFollowing that philosophy, I might run into another problem that I have absolutely ran into before when trying and failing to pick a favorite. There are many unique shows out there. But often I cannot convince myself that the show, although breaking new ground, will not just inspire another show of a similar genre with more honest characters, or a more vibrant story, or even with just better production. With Shinsekai Yori, for some reason, I cannot imagine a case where this show is simply the flagship for a new lineage of story. It fits into these genres - sci-fi, dystopian, horror, drama, but these labels seem to me for once as only attempts to model or explain what I've just experienced after the fact, rather than a mold for what I should expect or what lines this story has to follow along to be included in these categories.\\n\\n\r\nAt many moments the show had the opportunity to pull a punch, and it didn't. At many moments it should have, and it did. At many moments it set the stage for development, but it took its time or it assumed on the part of its viewer that these developments were part of the all-encompassing world built within the show, and that because I acknowledged them, they were there, and it proceeded to deliver its messages with cool disregard for leaving me behind or catching me up.\\n\\n\r\nOn every single level Shinsekai Yori is a masterpiece, not of one genre, but a masterpiece in the sense that intelligent human life on this planet is a rare miracle. Stories are the species' way of celebrating that miracle, a species lonely that they are the only ones who will care to appreciate what their own lives meant in this humming corner of the empty universe. Stories are a celebration of us, people who live for a handful of generations and die to the indifference of all matter around us except those who remember us, who will too have their stories forgotten. Shinsekai Yori cries out to that lonely instinct to appreciate human sacrifice, desires, and growth, hoping that others will carry on even a whisper of who you were and what you dreamed hundreds of years after you are gone.",

            "content": "I hated this anime after the first few episodes. It comes back to life a few times then sucks again but ultimately the end was satisfying and EVERYTHING is explained. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone honestly I kind of wanted to die watching it because the story is all over the fucking place and nothing is explained until later... :)\r\nArt is beautiful (the reason why I was drawn to it).\r\nThe synopsis for this anime doesn't sum up the entire anime AT ALL be warned there's two separate story lines (In the town VS. outside of town with the Queerats) going on for most ofthe anime, they get connected later on. The Queerat stuff was definitely what made me hate this anime and want to stop watching it multiple times. It never goes away but it does get slightly easier to bear watching as you go along.\\n\r\nThe music is alright but there isn't much variety. If you like chorus you'll be okay.\\n\r\nCharacters don't have much of a personality. One emotion from beginning to end. There were only a few times in the last few episodes where I could relate to the main character Saki.\\n\\n\r\nI hope you spare the time I wasted in life watching this lol",

            "content": "Any great science fiction story has to deal with the moral consequences of the society it creates. Does technology improve human lives? How should we treat those who are aliens or the next step in human evolution?\r\nShinsekai yori does an excellent job of creating such a futuristic yet realistic society, and by the series' end, explores some of these questions. I highly recommend this series to anyone who doesn't mind a lot of exposition in their anime. If you find the world-building interesting, I dare you not to binge watch the final arc in a single sitting.\r\nDetailed scores:\r\nStory: 8\r\nIn my mind, the setting is asort of spiritual sequel to something like Elfen Lied. Whereas the story of Lucy and Nyuu from EL deal with the emergence of a \"superior\" species, Shinsekai yori explores the long term consequences of such events. The common trait of both anime is the development of psychokinesis, something that SSY calls \"Power\".\\n\\n\r\nIf a human brain (and as a consequence human emotion and imagination) is capable of directly affecting the outside world, doesn't that throw the currently organized society out the window? No matter what the miniscule percentage of the population has this innately devastating power to take and control life with a single thought, the ensuing genocide will ensure only the \"superior\" species will be left.\\n\\n\r\nWhat about hundreds of years after these events? Will there be a successful society amongst these superpeople? Maybe. How will it differ from our current society? Would their methods be seen as draconian, totalitarian, or based in the flawed ideals of divine right monarchy?\\n\\n\r\nIf these thoughts tickle your curiosity,  then the plot of Shinsekai Yori will provide endless brain food. Conflicts are full of improvisational thinking and use of Power, and plot-building uses enough science lingo to make unrealistic plot points believable.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing of the story is deliberately slow in the beginning. The viewer initially knows nothing, like the children of the first two arcs. As the time skips happen, the inner workings of their society are slowly unraveled.\\n\\n\r\nAs said before, there is a LOT of world-building, and every time skip usually has a episode dedicated to how the relationships between characters changed over the years not presented to the viewer. This is probably the only negative aspect of the storyline, but even at that not many critical plot points are explained more than once.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to animation I have to again rely upon my comparison of this series to Elfen Lied. Fights that involve the use of Power are brief and brutally violent. The few lengthy action oriented scenes are a beautiful reward for those who can wait a few episodes of plot and foreshadowing. Things will fly, blood will flow, and the viewer is shown the strength of Power.\\n\\n\r\nThe settings of SSY all fall underneath the umbrella of \"feudal Japan\", and as a result may seem redundant or repetitive at times. Distinctly futuristic backdrops are few and far between. This is where Shinsekai Yori differs from much of its sci-fi brethren.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless, the execution of the art in scenes like starry nights and climactic battles is excellent. Creative camera angles are used, but never disorient the viewer. Not to mention that the first ED video is a feast for the eyes, covering the screen with a night time fireworks show reflected in the river below.\\n\\n\r\nThe distinctive \"look\" of each major character is also slightly repetitive in the beginning and there are occasional faults of hiccups in the overall execution of the animation. Different shots in the same scene may inexplicably have radically different lighting and contrast, and some plot building is done by shots of talking heads. These instances didn't really detract from any positive aspects the art had to offer, however.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nI often hear that the characters of Shinsekai Yori are flat or two dimensional, and show little development over the course of the series. \\n\r\nI would agree on some fronts. The heroine of the story, Saki, is in some ways just as naive at the end of the story as she was in the beginning. Even though her judgments on the world around her change, her core moral beliefs are never challenged no matter what insane things happen around her.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless, I give this aspect of SSY an 8 because the static nature of each character enhances the moral dilemmas that they face. Long term character development is sacrificed in order to escalate the core conflicts that last between each time skip in a consistent way. The static nature of each character and their flaws between time skips ensures that the reactions of each character to major events send the message that the director and writers want to send to the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I consider the characters in this manner, as lenses with which to magnify and dissect the moral dilemmas that are dealt by the story, I begin to think of their lack of development as a consequence of having this entire series of events over a relatively short 25 episode anime. My score is based on the idea that such a sacrifice was necessary to improve the overall quality of the anime. If you disagree, then obviously your score will differ.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nWhew. What a ride. The final arc and conclusion of the series was fulfilling and tied up most loose ends. The final plot points are a surprise, and the major characters end their stories with a positive or sympathetic note. The core rhetorical questions that define a sci-fi series are explored and answered without cheapening the events of the story, something that I find even iconic anime like Akira unable to do.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\\n\r\nI have to place Shinsekai Yori in that rare list of anime that successfully defy genre standards. \\n\r\nMost sci-fi depict the future as a dying world suffering under the advances of science and technology. Shinsekai Yori depicts it as a reborn, completely New World filled with hope. A hope that maybe the sacrifice of freedoms, memories, and sometimes lives will not be in vain.",

            "content": "In my opinion, Shinsekai Yori is the best anime I have ever seen. I love how the series blend many different genres such as futuristic and psychological. I love how the story is fueled through many science based topics such as genetics. The characters in this show are great because most of them are relatable and even the most inhuman of characters seem human because of how psychologically driven this show is.  For example, I can relate to Saki, the main character, so well and her reactions to the events (some of them at least) would be same as mine. This is why sheis my favorite character in the series. Because this show follows many different stages of the characters' lives, it is interesting to see how the various characters mature and change throughout the series.The story is very complex and it seem that like in the end, that every detail matters. The best part is seeing how these details will affect the story. The many themes in this story such as moral ambiguity move the story on by portraying which is morally right versus what is best for society as a whole. The best part of this series is how everyone is portrayed as totally human and are affected by human traits all throughout the series like paranoia still being present in an \"utopian\" society. I love how this series shows how false a utopian society is and how the government must hide society's problems through many evil techniques. The art style is something that I have never seen in an anime before which adds the uniqueness of this series. The ost to this series is amazing and helps build up the most important scenes in the series. Also the song \"Goin Home\" or \"Largo from Dvorak's 9th Symphony\" is one of the most symbolic pieces of music in this series (I won't say more about it though).\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this series deserves a 10/10. It is the only series up to date where I would stay up until 1 or 2 in the morning waiting for the subbed version to come out. Also the episodes went by very fast and it made 22 minutes seem a lot shorter.",

            "content": "Let me start by saying that Shinsekai Yori is not an anime that everyone will enjoy, but it is without a doubt a storytelling masterpiece. After my second watch, it became clear to me that I had to write a review to help guide potential viewers.\r\nFirst off, it is important to understand exactly what kind of anime you are getting into. Shinsekai Yori is a story of mysteries, each being introduced in succession at the beginning of the anime. What appears to be a story about six curious children quickly turns dark, depressing, and confusing as each mystery is unveiled to both the characters andthe viewers. To get the most out of Shinsekai Yori, you need to be ready to watch with a keen literary eye and a conscience braced for a heavy story.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY:\\n\r\nIt is difficult to review the story without spoiling any of the show's numerous secrets, so I will try not to delve too deeply. Shinsekai Yori has a beautifully constructed plot that follows a group of children across several different stages in their life, starting at age 12 and ending when they are 26.\\n\\n\r\nMany of the strengths of Shinsekai Yori lie in its characters, but it is how these characters interact with the mysterious world around them that makes it so special. Everything in this world has a secret, and the main cast is simply trying to understand how their society came to be, and why certain events are coming to pass. \\n\\n\r\nShinsekai Yori is a crescendo of mysteries. Thought-provoking questions are posed in the first half of the show, and their answers are brilliantly foreshadowed throughout. The second half reveals unexpected answers to these questions, building upon each secret and bringing the viewer to realize just how interconnected everything is, from the history of the village to the relationship between humans and the intelligent monsters who live just outside. Each answer builds upon the last, leading up to a staggering conclusion that flips the entire story on its head.\\n\\n\r\nShinsekai Yori will put you deep in thought, and the story's secret hero will force you to face difficult themes such as the nature of greed, power, democracy, sacrifice, and humanity itself. It will leave you with a pit in your stomach, so be braced for what you are about to see.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\r\nAs with any masterpiece, the characters are an important contributor to this anime's brilliance. The relationships feel real, particularly between Saki and Satoru. This sets Shinsekai Yori apart from other anime, in the sense that you can relate to and empathize with these characters at a deeper level. They all have unique personalities and feel REAL. The way they talk, make fun of each other, play outside, and interact in school simply makes sense.\\n\\n\r\nI give characters a 9/10 for one simple but important reason. This is, in my opinion, the single greatest flaw in Shinsekai Yori: there is an important character (to the two leads) that is drastically underdeveloped considering the role he/she plays in the decisions, emotions, and motivations of the two lead characters. While it is not enough to distract the viewer from the better components of the anime, it is a shame that such a strong story has such an obvious flaw.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPRESENTATION:\\n\r\nOne of the story's incredible strengths is how it's characters interact with the setting in which Shinsekai Yori is based. The time at which the show takes place is futuristic, but the world these children live in is not the polluted, dirty landscape we imagine when we think of the actual future of our planet. Nature is abundant, and technology is sparse, only being used where absolutely necessary. The children play outside and the village has a rural medieval feel.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this anime is incredible, and while I did not like a couple of the stylistic choices for character expressions during the middle of the show, the sheer beauty of every backdrop in the entire production makes up for it. Animation remained clean throughout, and only ever added to the brilliance of Shinsekai Yori.\\n\\n\r\nThere is also some incredible music. The main theme plays at some point during every episode, and its a song sang by a children's choir that will give you the chills. There are other good tracks throughout, but some of the darker themes and action music is a little distracting. It won't impact your enjoyment of the show overall, but considering the music has such incredible high points, its a shame it was not well rounded throughout.\\n\\n\r\nI should also add that voice acting gets top marks in my book (subbed, haven't watched dubbed).\\n\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION:\\n\r\nIf you skipped to this point, read my intro as well; its important.\\n\\n\r\nShinsekai Yori is a brilliant anime, whose story watches a cast of wonderful characters unveil a crescendo of mysteries. It will leave you deep in thought when you finish, and the story demands a second watch. The sound and art are phenomenal, and the setting is unique and beautiful. If you decide to pick up Shinsekai Yori, bear these things in mind:\\n\\n\r\n1. Do not drop this anime because of some of its controversial sexual themes. They are brief and play an important role in the story.\\n\\n\r\n2. Watch this anime within a week's time. There is too much info to remember over a longer period.\\n\\n\r\n3. There is a lull when they begin telling the story at age 26. Keep watching. It becomes very climactic, and you will rediscover your love for the two lead characters.\\n\\n\r\n4. Watch with a literary eye. Infer as you go. Watching Shinsekai Yori will not be a passive experience!\\n\\n\r\nWith all this in mind, enjoy one of the most brilliantly crafted stories ever written!",

            "content": "In depth review #1 - Shinsekai Yori - From the new World (No spoilers)\r\nPlot/Story:\r\nShinsekai Yori follows the perspectives of 5 young children (Saki, Satoru, Maria, Mamoru, and Shun) in a dystopian society set a millennia in the future. The main character, Saki, starts the story off by acquiring her powers at the age of 12. The power i am referring to is psychokinesis PK or just telekinesis. Saki then joins up with the 4 other characters in the main class where they develop their powers. While here, saki and her friends stumble upon forbidden knowledge of the past they shouldn't of had. The now haveto deal with the stress of knowing the truth and the consequences their society has in store for them from knowing.\\n\\n\r\nGenre: \\n\r\nShinsekai Yori is a supernatural dystopian thriller anime. It may seem like this anime is a little too ambitious with it use of genres but the creator blended them together perfectly with his comprehensive plot.The supernatural elements in this anime comes from the mystical creatures that dwell in this universe and from how certain humans acquire the ability of PK (psychokinesis) when they are young. The dystopian element of this anime is the main focus throughout the show. The society that was created in this show is a bleak, strict and cautious one but there is a reason for it. Whether or not the actions that where carried out in this society is justified is debatable, which is theme tackled by many other animes in this genre. Something that was done differently in the anime however was viewing this dystopia from a child point of view. The thriller aspect of the show comes from how each episode leaves you on a cliffhanger. Shinsekai Yori captures the moment of suspense through each cliffhanger perfect and i would say is the show better attributes. Also the events that occur involving the 5 main characters leaves you worrying about their well being in this society most of the time.\\n\\n\r\nMaturity Level: \\n\r\nIf you are planning on watching this anime and want to truly enjoy it you are going the have to be somewhat mature. This is because this anime expresses many mature and dark themes throughout it such as loss, sacrifice and death that will make you think about how it corresponds to our reality. It may seem simple but it requires some form of critical thinking skills to understand the severity of the actions that happens in this dystopia. I wouldn't recommend to kids. Also for some reason, many people believe this anime to be confusing. Honestly it really isn't. All you need to do is pay attention to blatant foreshadowing and to the dialogue and you are good. There are some episodes that will purposely try to confuse you though, which i thought was a cool mechanism, so don't get discouraged if you don't know everything off the back. Everything is perfectly explained as the anime progresses if you didn't understand it already.\\n\r\nAs for gore and blood and sex there is a couple of instances that are worth pointing out. For blood and gore, there are scenes where people experience gruesome and bloody deaths. Don't worry though, this isn't the focus of the show. These scenes are mainly used to signify dominance and power and nothing more. As for sex, there isn't any nudity but there is a couple of kissing sequences that made the show a bit controversial. There is a gay kissing scene in episode 8 and people thought that this was enough to drop the show. I ensure you this is not a yaoi or anything close to one. It was just one scene that portrayed a theme used to described their dystopian society in an earlier episode. This is why you need to be somewhat mature and not be so simple minded when it comes to this anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe story focuses around 5 characters  (Saki, Satoru, Maria, Mamoru, and Shun). They are all friends in the same PK class who were paired together in group 1. The story tells the story behind each characters memorable moments with each other and how they react with the realization about their existence in this world. At first they are just regular kids but when they all find out about what happens in the past, they each develop differently corresponding to the level of shock they endured from the news. Most of what happens to their development would spoil somethings so ill just leave this segment at this point.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation/Production Value:\\n\r\nI personal loved the animation but ill try to be as unbiased as possible in this segment. The animation team was very ambitious during their time animating this series. They hired a couple of different people to make certain episodes throughout the show. Usually there is just one animation team in animes so there were a couple notable consistency issue throughout the show. The most memorable change being on episode five where the quality in the animation takes a nosedive. It stays like this so a couple of episode which turned a couple of people off from the show sudden change in animation. The first four episodes however are visual stunning and catches back up later.  As for use of color, this anime can look like a radiant painting in one scene and a gloomy mystical realm in others. There color pallet is wide and is illuminated in almost of there dramatic scenes. They also managed to light darker lit spaces like caves and nights well, something other animes struggle with sometimes.\\n\\n\r\nSound /Production Value:\\n\r\nAs for the sound, i believed it to have a very high production value. The sounds and tunes that played in the background of the show were subtle but noticeable enough to be memorable. They also complemented the tone of the animation very well while the creator was stressing a specific mood. Transitioning to the OST, i believed it to be one of the better ones i heard in a while. I usually don't bother listening to the OST in anime but i just had to for Shinsekai Yori. I have around 7 songs that i am in love with, including the ending theme song. Overall, the sound production gives off a feudal Japanese area vibe that is filled with mysticism. I though it fit well with the series.\\n\\n\r\nOpening/Ending:\\n\r\nSomething that i thought was really unique in this anime was that it didn't have an opening theme. While watching the show - I didn't feel as if i was missing something without it. While analyzing the series after watching it, i would say it was better off without one since it wasn't needed. It reminds me of the anime Mushishi where a flashy 1:30 opening would alter the pacing and the aura given of from the show. As stated earlier, Shinsekai Yori did have an ending theme which was extremely catchy. When i first heard it i though i was lagging but after i realized that it was part of the song it grew on me. It had a certain refreshing atmosphere to it that made me listen to it every time it came on. I usually skip past ending themes but not through this one.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts: I would say that is anime was amazing. I heard about it from a video titled \"unrated anime in 2013\" a couple of days ago and it definitely is a hidden gem. The style of the anime and the most unique plot i heard in a while left me speechless while watching it. This is especially true for when everything i was thinking about unravels and comes to fruition.   8.4/10",

            "content": "Over the last decades, anime which are set in a distant future have become one of the most attractive and original stories on the anime industry. Shinsekai Yori takes us to a not so distant future where Man has created a new order(Although the story is set on Japan). Unlike the cyberpunk genre and other futuristic anime series, in this anime we won't see technological development (with exceptions) . It is set in a rural environment, with lots of crop fields and temples.\r\nJapan is divided into a lot of societies where humans have developed special psychic powers called \"Cantus\u201d, also known as telekinesis power. Theoreticallythese powers are an advantage which could be beneficial for the society but the world has changed and you can't judge a book by looking at the cover, the world hides a terrible secret.\\n\\n\r\nThe country is divided into a lot of districts. Besides humans, there are a lot of colonies where live several species besides humans, highlighting Robber Fly colony , Giant Hornet colony and Goat Moth colony which will play an important and decisive role on the story. All this is because of the superiority which humans sometimes demonstrates, proclaimed them as the \"superior race\"(at least hypothetically) versus all the rest of the species. Obviously these groups are not feeling so good for this.\\n\\n\r\nBetween all this organizations, in a small village of one the districts, six boys are playing on a mountainside. The development of the psychic powers started to manifest on a specific moment, everyone have its own development. When all her group of friends has entered on the school, Watanabe Saki is depressed for being the only one who doesn\u00b4t get an opportunity to prove herself. \\n\\n\r\nFinally one day, she gets it and rejoins her group of friends. The days passed normally when and strange rumor started to circulate: the legend of the impure cat which kidnaps children. This rumor is also known by the adults, who are worried for the security of their children.\\n\\n\r\nFor making the things worse, the legend becomes reality and the students start to disappear. Saki and her group started to investigate what is the origin of the world where they are living and why they are experimenting so much pain. The New World has been created with the human cruelty and blood, wars and human suffering (Literally).\\n\\n\r\nIn this entire secrecy atmosphere, the boys tried to continue with their lives and in a bit of time several events takes them to meet the other species who lives on the world, concretely Robber Fly colony with his leader Squealer. He is one of the most interesting (or even the most interesting) character in the story. Squealer is considered like a speaker, the voice and ruler on the colony who are disgusted with the behavior of the humans and is waging on a war versus Ground Spider colony. His role on the story is one of the most controversial themes on Shinsekai Yori, who is the villain and who is the \"hero\" on this story?\\n\\n\r\nBut it isn't the only one. Also another conflict point which usually is debated in every forum is the presence and importance of the sexuality on this anime. But not only between persons of the opposite sex but also with the same sex (after watching the first five episodes more and less you will know why this is)\\n\\n\r\nWith all this strong points, Shinsekai Yori isn't an anime for everyone, the darker setting along with the gore ( even macabre) and psychological themes, creates a very mature anime, very recommendable if you are not looking for the \"usual kind of anime\". None of the characters are afraid of showing how they are feeling, what are the desires and necessities and how to satiate that. For all this the characters are on the strongest point of the anime. One of the most interesting aspects of this peculiar group of friends are that each one has its own personality, since the typical comedian boy, the shy boy, the adventurous girl and the curious girl creates a great cast of characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe meaning of moral and social rules is very changed of the initial conception, which develops the characters personality all over the story. Society will become darker and the social and legal laws have been taken to the extreme, having greater social controls, leading the youth to be educated in an environment of occultism and conflict with continuous skill development.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the music, most of them serve too well to heighten the tension and creates a dramatic atmosphere. Though there aren't any opening themes, the ending themes Wareta Ringo and Yuki ni Saku Hana serves are very sad themes which connects too well to the horror and supernatural themes of the anime series.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum up, this is one of the most interesting anime that you will find. I consider it as the best anime series of 2013 and it is so recommendable if you are looking for a less conventional story, in a world where the social rules have changed, where children can \"live on peace\"\\n",

            "content": "\u201eThe power of imagination can change everything\u201c\r\nShinsekai Yori shows you your inner fears, lets you think about the fate of humanity and your inner feelings. It\u2019s definitely an unordinary anime, in a good way of course. The story is happening one thousand years in the future. Saki, the main character tells you her life in a retrospective way. Right at the beginning you get the feeling that there is something odd about the setting, not just because humans have the power of psychokinesis, if you think about future settings you actually never had this kind of world in mind. If you start thinking about this,the story has already caught you. The idea behind this anime is unique and completely thought-out.\\n\\n\r\nAfter I watched an episode of Shinsekai Yori I sometimes needed a break just to rethink what I just saw. The story is so complex and deep that you don\u2019t just watch it, you enjoy it, you try to understand the actions of the characters. At the beginning you know nothing about the story but you want to know more, this raises the whole length of the anime until the end, no episode is boring, you get the feeling that everything what happens has a meaning. Unlike other animes I didn\u2019t see any plot holes, everything was thought-out well. The supernatural power is is not just there, like in many other animes, it has a reason and it actually fits in the story quite nicely. The power is not too much, there aren\u2019t unnecessary power-ups or unlogical usage of the power. \\n\\n\r\nThe style of art is amazing. At the beginning I thought it would be a bit trashy because it\u2019s a new style, a very unique one. If you keep watching you will start to love the style of drawing and animation, this art is just beautiful, the colors are outstanding and always fit the atmosphere, to watch it in HD is totally worth it.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is one of the best I ever heared in an anime. I just love the soundtrack, it fits the setting and emotions so nicely. It\u2019s very calm and deep for the most part but it can spring almost instantly to dramatic or sad. The soundtrack together with the pictures are a perfect match. I don\u2019t like the sound of most of the animes but this, this was not just random music, it was art, like if you are going to an opera. The sound alone is a reason to watch this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are very special. At the beginning I was so interested in the background story that I didn\u2019t pay as much attention to the characters. But Saki as the main character evolves very quickly within the anime, the anime starts when she is a kid, and ends when she is 36 and tells you her story, you really feel with her and you will starting to love her more and more as the anime progresses. The characters are showing in a really good way how different we really are, love, sacrifice, honesty, honor, hate, revenge, they show you how human beings really think and you maybe gain an inside in your own heart.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed every minute of Shinsekai Yori. I\u2019m not one the guys who watched all episodes in a marathon, just because I wanted to enjoy it as long as I can. Shinsekai Yori has a message to us which let us think about our existence and our future.  You maybe are a bit askance about the anime because of it\u2019s unordinary art and story but you really have to give it a shot, you won\u2019t regret it. \\n\\n\r\nWell, this was kind of a short review but I hope I could help you with the decision to watch it. Feel free to leave a comment or feedback.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Summary: atmospheric quasi-hard SF dystopia; good production values plus a mostly-sensible & fairly unique plot make for a memorable experience.\r\nI liked _SSY_ from the start: you are pitched into an apparently utopian futuristic-Japanese-Scandinavian rural farming village (shades of _Higurashi_!) along with young protagonist Saki & her friends, but immediately you start to suspect that a horrible truth is lurking, that this is a Brave New World designed to produce... what? What's the horrible reality? Why are her parents so worried? Children are disappearing, to what end? Casually introduced is a species of intelligent slave-rats (by what right?) Clues are regularly foreshadowed, daring the view totry to predict, not always successfully.\\n\\n\r\nOur main characters walk a knife edge between ignorance and incurring the ultimate sanction by prying too much, hiding from the adults even as they are unsure they have anything to fear, and in keeping with the paranoia, the atmospherics & stellar soundtrack are tuned by the director to veer from idyllic to horror within instants, until finally the truth is broken in a big data dump. The system of the world is unveiled: they are walking weapons of mass destruction which destroyed ancient civilization, and the entire system is geared toward suppressing any homicidal tendencies through brainwashing, genetic manipulation, and ruthless murder of any children who might become the slightest threat. The future plot seems clear: this is something of a \"The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas\"-situation, and being an anime, I can easily predict what will happen next - the kind-hearted heroine will lead a rebellion against the odious (if well-intentioned) regime, topple it, and install some fairer less-filicidal system. Surprised in the data dump, they luck out when the watchdog is killed and get involved in the slave-rat politics, further demonstrating the cruelty and manipulation of their society. From then on, shit gets real: politics outside the barrier is just as brutal as life inside the barrier under the scrutiny of murderous teachers - ambushes, poison arrows, armies, deception, enslaving baby rat-slaves, nothing is off limits. After wading through a sea of blood, they think they've escaped.\\n\\n\r\nBut nope! The adults were onto them all along, and the obvious is completely subverted. They return to normal life (albeit with some hilarious swings, like the episode where all of a sudden everyone is gay), and one of the protagonists suffers the long-forecast breakdown, taking out a whole village with him. Things look a bit different and the system starts to look better: what's the alternative?\\n\\n\r\nIn post-dystopian societies, there's two major kinds of plot: rebellion, and attack. The latter focuses on a society that has failed to keep growing or developing, that has chosen stasis and passivity. But this is a dangerous choice, as the world may keep changing: \"He that will not apply new remedies must expect new evils; for time is the greatest innovator.\" (Consider Sowell's \"tragic vision\" vs \"utopian vision\" in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Conflict_of_Visions or Scott's \"survive\" vs \"thrive\" http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/03/04/a-thrivesurvive-theory-of-the-political-spectrum/ ; apocalypses and dystopias embody morality plays from the tragic/survive paradigm where people forget the crawling chaos that underlies everyday life, where they forget that civilization was forged in blood and that fundamentally _homo homini lupus est_.)\\n\\n\r\nInstead, we start to see worrying signs of progress among the rat-slaves: concrete? Brainwashing of their formerly dominant queens? Representative democracy? Yet the villages themselves seem to lack any of these: construction is fragile wood and they don't even know who rules them (the committees work in secrecy). And they are actively decaying: there are repeated mentions of electricity rationing and limits, the education of children seems to ignore any real science and technology, military considerations begin and end with psychic powers, villagers are conditioned to be fearful of the world, new mutations/animals/monsters keep springing up outside the barrier (and predictably so due to Cantus leakage) with little note taken of them inside, they have no military to speak of and indeed all their efforts are effectively bent towards crippling any ability to self-police (the world-building seems seriously flawed, since who would choose to make *every* human unable to kill another human when the whole point was to stop Fiends who apparently have no problem shaking off their conditioning\u203d), the arrogant eschewing any use of fortification despite the value of them against slave-rats & other mutants & the utility of fortified shelter for even psychers (safe place to attack from), and the population is apparently on the decline given the failure to repopulate the village Shun destroyed. Society had grown complacent, self-satisfied, indolent, and weak by shutting itself off from the world. The message is even less subtle in the first episode of _Attack on Titan_ where characters refer to the king ordering people not to go beyond the walls, and where salvation seems to lie in stealing the power of the outsiders who break through the walls - can there be any doubt that this is in part a criticism of Japan's years closed off from the world under the _sakoku_ policy? (At least, if it isn't, it's a bit eery how well _AoT_ works as a metaphor, and it's difficult to explain the inclusion of a character based on Akiyama Yoshifuru otherwise.)\\n\\n\r\nThe stage is set for disaster. And disaster there is: a multipronged attack by subterfuge, indirect sabotage, poison, the use of new mutants and rediscovered technologies, and use of the blatant fatal flaw in the system, another human without inhibitions, a Fiend, whose origin makes a complete mockery of an earlier plot event the viewer took as a victory for the protagonists, undermining it and leaving a bitter taste.\\n\\n\r\nAfter this point the plot starts getting weaker. They pursue a Macguffin to defeat the Fiend, some mushy-headedness undermines it, the plot & director hint heavily at their assistant planning to betray them (which would have been a great twist: the whole Macguffin was planned by the villain to obtain an anti-psycher weapon and cement his victory) but ultimately decides against it, a clever loophole is found, they win, and the status quo is restored after most (but not all) of the slave-rats have been genocided. The protagonists then discover the slave-rats were engineered by their ancestors into slaves who could be casually slaughtered, and decide to... do nothing. We close with some further sentimentality about improving society. Somehow. What? When Satoru plays with Tainted Kittens (whose purpose we recall clearly) and Saki spares some slave-rats, it's hard not to wonder what exactly we're supposed to take away here; her apparent act of mercy for Squealer is offset by the nostalgia and suspicion she's doing it for her own sake. I found myself wondering if this was intended to be a _1984_ sort of twist, showing how the protagonists have become completely and totally coopted by the system.\\n\\n\r\nThe story strives to be hard SF, with good explanations for everything (even offering a little speculation on what runs psychic powers, since clearly the user is spending nowhere near enough energy to accomplish the feats), and is so good I cannot resist taking it seriously and noticing flaws rather than simply suspending belief and turning off my brain. And the plot does has a number of issues: some Chekhov's guns are simply dropped without further comment: the leader who has lived for centuries never teaches Saki her secrets, indeed, that is never mentioned afterwards; the protagonists apparently had *another* member in their group who they've lost memories of, but this is also dropped without any additional memory; how exactly Maria and Mamoru could've had a child in the time before they are killed by the rat-slaves is not explained. Other problems include: the final gambit is mindbendingly risky (what if the Fiend had simply burned Kiroumaru alive *like almost every other victim*?), the overall structure of society makes only partial sense and is fragile to even one Fiend yet apparently everyone is holding an Idiot Ball and focuses purely on prevention and never on dealing with the inevitable Fiend; there are no reforms after the attacks exposed multiple flaws in their security; the ambivalence on Squealer (the most interesting of characters in the entire series) seems as much a product of poor writing as intended thought-provoking moral ambiguity; parts of the claimed world-building are not carried through (so, the scientists based things on bonobo troops and free love... which is why everyone is *monogamous*\u203d where are the orgies and one-night stands, where are the polyamorous assortments of lovers?) or are implausible (brain surgery does not work that way, even in slave-rats-human-hybrids).",

            "content": "\"We ultimately fear what spawns from within us.\" \u2014 Shun Aonuma\r\nEve of 30th September 2012, It had been roughly three years since I started watching anime. I was sitting on facebook, trying to scroll my boredom away. The past two seasons of anime haven't brought a single good show and my enthusiasm for anime had hit rock-bottom, more like for modern anime. Suddenly I received a message from a familiar name who I haven't talked to much recently, the basic contents of message just said - \"Shin Sekai Yori - anime - must watch - first episode out\". That recommendation, on that fateful day endedup restoring my faith.\\n\\n\\n\r\n\"Sometimes, the truth is the cruelest thing of all.\" \u2014 Maria Akizuki\\n\\n\r\nAs if being true to the quote, SSY doesn't shies away from letting it's viewer know that things are going to get ugly from the get go, as one begins to question \"the truth\" behind the utopia. In fact when the chips does go down and struggle begins - It feels \"organic\" and nothing alike a forced development. It really had been a long time since an anime had engaged and intimidated me and with later episodes, I also begin to understand why it got categorized under science fiction, which is hard to explain here without giving out spoilers, though one might argue that it has both pseudo-science and scientific elements entangled with one-another. What fascinated me more, is the mix of spirituality and science in a few scenes, the age-old question(s) and the controversy that comes along with it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTypically, SSY is a show of \"details\", if you don't pay attention you'll be left behind along it's uneven pace and at times, non-chronological execution. There are a lot of elements, quotes and events that mimics and symbolizes our current society and the ideologies behind it very well [the quote I wrote in the beginning on this review, yes the one which you may have already dismissed as a cheesy line - keep it in mind while watching and you may see]. I've been told many times -\"Hey! it's just an anime...don't think too much\", I'd say it's precisely the result of this type of thought process which doesn't let people to really appreciate and explore a genuinely good series and to judge for what it really is. Instead more and more dumb, wish-fulfilling, moe and cliche' shows hogs up the limelight, even get revered as \"smart\", \"intelligent\" and \"best\" by the masses. That's also why most makers take their audience for a fool and we get less good shows.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing to praise here is the music, that resonates within you from the inception. A beautiful, traditional, innovative and befitting set of scores brings out the best in the story. Listening to \"Going Home\" still creeps me out. The ED sung by Taneda Risa - Wareta Ringo [http://goo.gl/bRZArn] is another likable addition, both for anime and my playlist. Also, since I've come to develop a taste for classical music during \"Nodame Cantabile\", in Shin Sekai too I can't help but appreciate the symphony by Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k (From the New World) - [http://goo.gl/nfa5xz]. The VA's have also performed very well. In fact, it becomes an important part of the narrative by the end of first episode, if you can catch the \"hint\" fast enough.\\n\\n\\n\r\nHow can one forget to mention the unique art style of SSY! Not only is it hauntingly charming but the character designs also carry a freshness to them, which is a much required relief from the recent moe-fication of anime industry and ultimately becomes a driving force for the story. One can clearly notice the \"jumps\" and inconsistency in art, as the result of multiple directors directing different episodes in their own style, not just in art but in story too. Where as it might be frowned upon as \"link-breaking\", it doesn't defy the logic of SSY and is more aligned with the narrative, so it might not necessarily a bad thing. Also, one of the episode directors, Yamauchi Shigeyasu, whose direction I come to like after watching \"Casshern Sins\" (which I strongly recommend) brings his unique style to SSY's particular episodes and raises the bar of aesthetic perception.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIt's really sad that I can't be much descriptive about the storyline itself since I'm trying my best to avoid giving out possible spoilers and ruining it for you. But as far as character development is concerned, I'm more than happy that this coming-of-age anime remains truthful and realistic towards the events/confabs/relations, that shapes up the thought process of our characters much like how a real person may react. Personality development comes out as natural and \"i-don't-know-who-the-fuck-is-he/she\" moment never comes, character remains [comfortable] in their skins throughout.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIn short SSY is a dark tale of \"humanity\", twisted moralities, conflicting philosophies, friendship, love, lies, betrayal and of survival. It, however contains some controversial scenes and themes, which although doesn't effect the overall anime, might put off a few people, I advice them to be wise and try to see the broader picture here. The moment I had finished watching first episode of SSY, even the pessimistic and skeptical side of me admitted that this one has promise. And after finishing the last episode I felt sad, I had found a good series that I followed weekly and now it had ended. SSY, in all it's entirety, is a very good series and for me - the best anime of 2012.",

            "content": "I have heard the name of this series a lots of times.I heard it from the reviews and comments of people who liked it and from the people who disliked it.I am one of those who liked the series.\r\nShinsekai yori brings to us a realistic future that is happening around one thousand years from now.Its setting is mostly happening in a small village that is excluded from the outside world.That village is the definision of the so called man-made utopia.The story follows a group of children with the power of PK(psychokinesis) who are living in that village.Ofcourse there is no such thing like a utopiaand the children slowly discover the secrets behing the missing children,tainted cats,bakenezuims and the history of the mankind.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime may look childish at the beginning but I would not recommend letting your children watch it.Trust me!!!This anime is by no means a pleasant watch.If you want a nice relaxing story that you can eat popcorn with while relaxing on your bed search somewhere else it deals with many adult themes that are very disturbing.Well I guess that there are some people that laugh at tragedies but I am not one of them.I almost forgot don\u2019t get turned off by the yaoi and yuri scenes , there arent a lot of them and they arent on level of the legendary ,,Boku no Pico\u201d.Even these scenes have a impact and a meaning in the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters\u2026There hasn\u2019t been one anime that made me feel like this .I hate all of them.I want to butcher them all and burn their bones.But at the same time I love all of them.The main cast is composed of five characters Satoru Asahina , Mamoru Itou ,Shun Aonuma,Maria Akizuki and the lead Saki Watanabe.I love and hate all of them.There was also another character but I wont mention him here you will probably guess when you watch the anime.Each of these characters have unique personalities and all of them make realistic decision based more on their common sense and knowledge than fellings.\\n\\n\r\nWhen writing about the sound of the anime you would begin from the opening.Opening ,opening , opening\u2026Was there such a thing?No I don\u2019t think so.There was no opening. Who needs an opening when you can listen to nice music all 24 minutes of the show. I think there wasn\u2019t a moment when I didn\u2019t hear the background music.The BGM was amazing and I don\u2019t say that a lot because I don\u2019t even notice that there is such a thing as BGM in most animes.\\n\\n\r\nArt is probably the weakest point of the series,but I didn\u2019t say anything about it being bad.The character desings were good and the background was amazing.Shortly said it did its job right.\\n\\n\r\nI didn\u2019t enjoy this anime.Not in a single moment.There were times when I was jumping around my room imagining myself killing all the people in this anime.Especially in the end I even had dreams in which I did all sorts of censored thing to them.There is no enjoyment in this anime only suffering.Only a true M would enjoy this.\\n\\n\r\nSo this is the end of the review, I said all I wanted to say now its up to you guys whatever you will watch it or not.I fell like I forgot something(Probably nothing important).\\n\\n\r\nSorry for the gramatical mistakes in the review.English is not my mother language so bare(deal) with it.Thanks for reading.\\n",

            "content": "Shinsekai Yori is probably one of the better releases the anime community has seen over the last couple of years. Initial impressions are rather timid. It reads like a checklist of mainstream-but-not-so-mainstream fare.\r\nSet in the future? Check.\r\nHumans? Check.\r\nVery few of the above left alive? Check.\r\nImplied (and later verified) apocalypse? Check.\r\nSuperhuman powers? Check.\r\nWeird beings? Check.\r\nSurrealist art, decent music and good production? Check.\r\nThe basic premise of the anime is actually revealed at the end of the anime. Literally at the end. The last frame reveals a message that says something along the lines of \"Imagination is power\" or \"Imagination is the source of all life\" or somethingsimilar; implying that thoughts are powerful. Thankfully, this does not turn out into a mushy experience. Shinsekai Yori is the story of a young girl named Saki Watanabe who grows up in a village in Japan. The story itself is presented as a reminiscence of a much older Saki as she recounts the events that unfolded as she grew up. The central plot tool here is the effects of 'Cantus', a psychic power present in all humans in the anime, and the chaos it causes despite being tightly reined in by the community. \\n\\n\r\nVery honestly put, the story is rather wayward. The central and final conflict happens to be about a species called 'queerats' trying to gain their independence from the humans. Strangely, this is something that is almost entirely left out until the last few episodes. On the other hand the story builds up a rather interesting and gripping piece about fiends and demons (humans who have lost control of their Cantus), and Cantus leakage, over the earlier episodes only to seemingly abandon the entire idea by the time the anime is half way through. It was rather grating to see things gain and lose relevancy throughout the anime. While the idea itself is novel, the fact that it was implemented badly made it look like the Shinsekais drawing the Yoris were rather halfhearted about things.\\n\\n\r\nThis doesn't mean that the story is a let down. Quite to the contrary, viewers will be pleased to note that their butts are still on the seats and eyes still on the screen by the time they reach the end of episode 25. The plot(s) (plural; since it is more meaningful to consider the 'queerat' story independent of the 'Cantus' story) are well thought-out, properly paced and most of all, satisfyingly explained. As satisfyingly explained as possible in a fantasy setup that is. Thankfully, both plot lines also manage to transition seamlessly, so most people will acquire the inevitable feeling of discontent only after finishing the anime and updating their anime lists.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is something that needs to be mentioned. While it was top notch, in some places, it felt as if the cell shading (yes, nobody shades cells anymore) somehow changed hands. This was most visible in one of the earlier episodes, where the tone of the visuals changed rather noticeably. Probably budget cuts.\\n\\n\r\nComing over to the audio and aural experience, it can be said that everything was excellent. The voice acting cast (Japanese) was spot-on and were also cast well. Hiroaki Hirata, as the queerat commander Kiromaru, deserves a special mention. Among all the characters/voice cast combinations in the anime, his was the best and suited the character to a T. The music, OP/ED and background score is a mix of things ranging from indomitable (and beautiful) Kana Hanazawa to Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k. There is never a dull moment in the anime thanks to all the sounds being in all the right places throughout the 25 episodes. However, a stern look could be given to the lip-synchronization.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in the anime are well done too. The anime follows the usual precedent for its genre by killing a character or two every few episodes and letting the MC cry a bit. This, of course, happens to be the protagonist's strength too. In fact, the 'strength' of the protagonist is explicitly mentioned several times but nobody will ever be certain about what it is. Top contenders include the ability to lose friends, crying and 'strength' itself.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest pitfall for Shinsekai Yori is its characters' tendency to yammer away at the most inopportune of moments. Being chased by monsters? Hey Shun, let's stop and talk a bit. Is our friend missing? I want to talk about my feelings for a moment now. Sometimes, the anime feels like Skyrim with all its lengthy dialogue in all the wrong places. It makes sense if a character is introspecting in the midst of a crisis (hello Naruto): this can be explained as time being irrelevant when presenting thoughts; but it makes absolutely no sense to see characters talking about friends when they're an inch away from death. Another thing that needs to be mentioned are the facial expressions and emotions which were mistimed in many instances. An example: Kiromaru, Saki and Satoru Asahina plan an attack in the final episode and Kiromaru leaves to execute the first part of the plan. What are Saki and Satoru up to? It is a life-or-death situation and they are both sitting down on a slab and calmly discussing things. One would expect the pacing here to be much faster with both of them getting their environment and themselves ready for their part of the plan, but no, they take this wonderful opportunity to relax and share a few feels.\\n\\n\r\nAll that said, Shinsekai Yori is definitely an anime that's worth watching. It's a well-rounded meal that'll leave one feeling satisfied but missing that one small, inexplicable bit. A setup for a sequel perhaps? Only time will tell.",

            "content": "Now this is my very first review. I do not feel as though I have much say in whether or not my opinion should have an affect in watching this show or not. So please, I advise you, take my opinions of this show as nothing more than what it is. An opinion. So without further ado, my review.\r\nStory:\r\n      The story that this show provides you with definitely provides some social commentary on society as a whole. It carefully puts together this world that Yusuke Kishi has made. You slowly learn of this world's customsand this world's traditions. You go in the show as a foreigner of this world and come out of it as a native. And I think that is the best way to describe this show.\\n\r\n     When you start watching, there is a lot that you just don't understand, and some things may come off to you as weird. That is because you are a foreigner of this world, and depending on whether or not you wish to stay in this world, you will have to grow used to some thing that are different. So in world building and storytelling, I definitely will give an A. \\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound: \\n\r\n     As for the art of this show, I'd say there are some problems I had. The art itself leaves something to be aspired for. It is not hard to watch by any means, and it even has some beautiful moments, but as a whole I felt like it could have been handled better. The character designs felt very plain. It looks as if they all the main characters share the same face and body types, and the art style was not easy to get used to for me. It was different, and although that is not always a bad thing, it was in the case of this show.\\n\r\n     The soundtrack itself was amazing. I found it absolutely fitting for the show, and it pushes certain emotions out of you. The ED itself, is one that I will go back to listen to time and time again. The music is really the best fit for the show. And for the voice acting, I'd say most of the voices were fitting except in maybe the later part of the show. The voice actor changes do affect the character somewhat, but the quality of the voice acting does not waver. The voice of the main antagonist is really fitting too. (By the way, I watched the sub only.)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\n     The characters in this show are definitely well written. The situations that they are put through, are also situations that the viewer goes through and because of that, you grow to care for them more. You can tell what emotions are between which characters, and because of that you understand the importance of each character. Although the characters all live in a different world than you do, you can still relate to them because they are humans and they still show the emotions that we all have.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n     Although I feel this show fell short with some of the art that was portrayed, it really excelled in just about everything else. It may not have been entirely perfect, but to me I felt it gave me something that I just can't get from any other anime ever. And that is really saying something. Each episode has a way of making me want to watch the next and that is just what I look for in a show. (Not to say that cliffhangers are the best, but when they are pulled off right, they really are great.) So yes, I can see this as one of my favorite shows, but I think rewatching it is something that I would have to think about. It's not really a show that you can experience twice. It was really great as it is though and I would suggest it to anybody who loves, not only anime, but stories in general.",

            "content": "Thank you MAL community for suggesting this EXCELLENT anime. I was like a crack fiend, jonezing for the next SSY fix. Finished the series in 2 days. If you every find yourself confused while watching an episode, or perhaps want an intellectual and insightful commentary, please do yourself a favor and read Tenderfoot's recap at angryanimebitches.com.  I read every single blog post of hers (his?) and found each one to be a particularly helpful guide through the bramble bush of a plot line called Shinsekai Yori. Now on to the review!\r\nStory: 10. A memorable and abiding story. Hold on to your butts because thestory's got so many twists and turns, you'd swear SYY be twerking it (j/k!). We got twists for dayzz! Not many anime's have staying power, and I foresee that SYY will sustain in my conscious, perhaps even engraved for some time. As Tenderfoot mentions repeatedly in her commentary (but not ad nauseam), almost every sequence is intentionally imbued with significance. You probably can bet the barn a prior sequence of events will be referenced to in the future of the story. What a rarity it is to see this level of literary intentionality and craftsmanship in an anime, where a sequence in the beginning of the season would be referenced to in a later episode to provide that \"epiphany,\" making you say OH!!!! Part of the story involves multiple tribes/clans that go to war. While it isn't terribly confusing (a la Tolkien's Two Tower's), it does get a bit confusing when you add Japanese names to the mix. Again, thank you angryanimebitches.com (the name cracks me up) for being true north and giving me the lay of the land.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9. I'm so tempted to give the animation a 10. I am no artist. I draw stick figures. Bad stick figures. But even I could appreciate the beautiful colors, seasonal changes, and superimposed characters upon lush static backdrops. 1 point was docked because there were some episodes where there were clear signs of \"budget constraints.\" Otherwise, a beautiful anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8. What I appreciated GREATLY was there was no OP. Meaning, no cheesy song in the beginning where the characters stare at you awkwardly, or strike some unnatural pose, or show some bouncing boobies for that fan-swag. THANK YOU FOR NO OP! However, the ending song, and music within the anime was just okay.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8. I don't want to write a spoiler, but there really were only a handful of characters that ever got the full development treatment. The ones that did develop were crafted beautifully. Bad guys were despicable. The good guys were wise and noble. Just wish a few more people were \"alive\" to develop.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9. I bore easily with media consumption. I rarely watch shows, movies, or read books 2x. I watched True Detective 2x. I may watch SYY again. That's saying a lot.\\n\\n\r\nDo yourself a favor and watch this anime. And someone, for the love of all things holy, please make better SSY T-shirts and fan paraphernalia or us non-otaku fans to buy! The SSY merch is deplorable on google and amazon.",

            "content": "Shinsekai Yori was one of the more polarizing series of the Fall 2012 season.  Its dark themes, twisting and complex story, and slow pace turned a lot of viewers off.  But for those that saw it through to the end, they were treated to what I consider to be the best show of the year.\r\nStory:\r\nShinsekai Yori's story is set in a post-apocalyptic world, but in something of an inversion of genre expectations, we're introduced to a pastoral Japan, that's seemingly peaceful and well-maintained.  Of course, we know things are not quite what they seem.  How is a society of telekinetic humansable to thrive given the very nature of such a power, and its role in the collapse of ancient (our) civilization?  The rabbit hole goes deep, and the unraveling of this mystery through the eyes of Saki and the children of Group 1 is the engine that keeps this story moving.  It's an engaging, often unsettling, and always though-provoking tale.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nWe're being told the story of Shinsekai Yori through the yes of Saki Watanabe, who starts the series as a 12 year, freshly awakened to her telekinetic powers.  The story spans a considerable amount of time, and throughout it, we learn about the world, and experience Saki's growth into one of the strongest female characters in recent anime.  The supporting cast isn't as well fleshed out as Saki, but they are almost always believable, and some standouts, like Shun, Maria, Satoru, and Tomiko can carry the show on their own for stretches.  The unreliable memories and perspectives of Saki and her classmates is part of what makes experiencing this story so compelling.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe character design, backgrounds, and color palette of Shinsekai Yori are excellent.  Unfortunately, the same can not be said about the animation itself.  This is a sometimes slow, dialogue heavy show, but there are a number of action heavy sequences throughout, and the animation quality can drop noticeably.  During fights, and other high action, the visuals often can't keep pace with the intensity of the events that are unfolding.   Episodes 5 and 10 have a different director and art style altogether, and while I appreciate the impulse to try something potentially interesting, it just doesn't work here.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is consistently excellent, and the use of music (especially Dvorak's \"From the New World\") throughout the series amplifies the emotional impact of the experience.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nWatching Shinsekai Yori takes work.  The plot takes a while to develop, but you'll be rewarded for sticking with it.  There is a deep mystery to this world, and facts are hard to come by.  The plot is delivered in such a way that revelations often come by way of inference.  The fate of some characters, and the resolution of certain issues aren't bypassed - these aren't plot holes - but you won't always be told exactly how things happened.  Just like the main characters, you'll often be left to sort through incomplete information as you try to figure out what has actually transpired.  So, how enjoyable is Shinsekai Yori?  If you're like me, you'll find it to be an absolute blast.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nTaking this story on was ambitious, and there were some notable stumbles.  The animation is sometimes sloppy and rushed,  and in its worst moments, it can be utterly jarring.  Additionally, the pacing and editing is often inconsistent - it's sometimes brilliant (episode 16), and sometimes dismal (episode 5).\\n\\n\r\nThose issues aside, the outstanding plot, world creation, and characters are what set Shinsekai Yori apart.  The world of Shinsekai Yori, and the mystery that surrounds it, is excellently crafted.  We experience the world through the eyes of Saki.  We're never privy to more than what Saki, knows and experiences.  We know, as well as Saki does, that things are not as they seem, but like her, you won't be handed anything.  Sifting between reality and illusion is as important for the audience, as it is for the main cast.  This is the kind of show that demands engagement in order to be fully enjoyed.  If you can handle the animation hiccups, and have patience, you'll be rewarded with a unique, challenging, and beautiful piece of science-fiction.\\n",

            "content": "It's been a long time I wanted to write a review about Shinsekai Yori, an anime that give a lot to think that is even hard to pull out this in words, what makes review quite difficult.\r\n Shinsekai Yori is with no doubt one of the best animes out there, with well developed characters, an attractive narrative and a realism rare in any other anime. It has the depth that other animes lack. For the very same reason it is not to everyone, it is not fast pace, neither focused on action. It is however a very well developed psychological drama, that gives youa very interesting lore and background to what it really wants to show: a discussion about social relations, human nature and ethics.\\n\\n\r\n The story is very well told, with the beginning of the initial episodes showing intriguing moments of the past, which motivates the viewer to keep watching and find the answers to how civilization achieve that state, instead of quitting due to the somewhat (although necessary) boring beginning. After that the anime is very well developed, deluding the viewer, at the same time that put the answer in front of him. It permits great moments of climax full of plot twists, where the episode ends and you stand still looking at the monitor, or want to watch the next episode and see how Saki and his friends will react.\\n\\n\r\n The characters are very very well developed, at the point they seem real, especially Saki, Satoru, Shun, Maria, Kiroumaru and my dear Squealer. Watch them from childhood till grown up, and the changes and the relationship between, and how the worlds grows in complexity as they grow too is... contemplative, it's like watching an artistry painting over an outline, and when they're teenagers is the time it seems more beautiful, is the moment the series reaches its peak.\\n\\n\r\n Although the main characters being the most well developed, they're not in a paper world, the characters around them plays a great role, besides a greater role, since the mains characters, seems to being nothing but used by them. The history behind that world and the creatures the inhabit them are too very well detailed, the queerats especially. The more you dive into that world the better you can see its true colors. All theses characteristics are so overwhelming  that I forgot to say: they have powers!\\n\\n\r\n I recommend Shinsekai Yori to anyone who want a deep anime. The influence and the consequences of power instead of the show of power, enlightenment instead of entertainment, and wish to see realistic humans behaviors and relations,  full of philosophical nuances. Shinsekai Yori is a lesson about power structures and how things are not exactly how they are, and how the world is more twisted, complex and gray than we think, instead of simple and black and white.",

            "content": "IF there was ever a flawed masterpiece, it was Shinsekai Yori. This show man. This haunting sci-fi dystopia will stay with you long after you finish it. Without any further delay, lets get on with the review.\r\nStory- 10\r\nThe story of SSY is by far its strongest part, as it is one of the most interesting dystopian stories ever made in my opinion. This is the aspect that will keep you coming back for more. Very basically put, it follows Saki Watanabe, a 12 year old middle schooler, and her life as she realizes the world around her is not as perfect as it seems. Ican't go much past that without getting into spoilers, but it eventually gets into much darker topics like genocide, what it means to be human, and slavery. The pacing is pretty bad to be honest, as there are info dumps all over the place and the story doesn't kick into its top gear until the last 8 episodes, but when it does oh boy does it get good. Overall, the story is one that should not be missed by anyone, it starts off slow but by the time it gets to the last arc the story has picked up greatly and is honestly insane.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- 8\\n\r\nThe characters were... interesting. The best way for me to put it is that most of the characters were rather one dimensional and didn't get much screen time. This, however, is completely forgiven for having an amazing lead female character, Saki, and an amazing villain who I can't spoil. The stoy follows Saki's entire life and her growth from a girl to a woman, and while she is a flawed individual, she is human and you feel for her. Her character is over-emotional, and its a great lead to this show. The main villain who I won't spoil is my personal favorite villain in any anime, and just a brilliant character with motives arguably better than our main characters. So yea. Good MC and Villain, a couple good supporting characters (Satoru, Kiroumaru, and Shun) and everyone else was kinda underdeveloped.\\n\\n\r\nSound- 10\\n\r\nThis is one of my personal favorite OSTs in anime. The songs may be overused and the OST is small, but this is all made up for by how well it complements the show itself and sets the mood perfectly. This is exemplified by a song by the name of Traditional Song of Shadows, which you just have to listen to because it is beautiful. Finally, there is no OP but the ED is the single greatest in anime history. Watch it now.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation- 7\\n\r\nOk this is by far the show's weak point. The art style was done by A1 Pictures, and is a weird, not bad, but weird style. It could've be done right, but there were just too many faults to consider the animation more than just \"good\". Not much else to say.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 10\\n\r\nThis is controversial, because I enjoyed this show so much but I can see how many people could consider it boring. There is a lot of information to keep track of and the pacing, as mentioned, is incredibly slow and will bore a lot of people. But for me, the plot was just so interesting and I just couldn't drop it and kept watching episode after episode, and it was well worth it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- 10\\n\r\nLots of people will get bored of this show and drop it, but for those who stick it out you are in for one of the greatest pieces of fiction I've ever seen with a top-tier story, and I highly reccomend it to anyone who likes shows with good stories and great plot twists.",

            "content": "Let me begin this review by stating that my intent is to gloss over the perfections that make this outstanding piece the epitome of great story telling. Without revealing any plots, it is my goal to coerce you into watching one of the greatest epics imagined with a few indisputable points.\r\nIt is my belief that Shinsekai Yori is incomparable to even the greats, the very treasures of anime jewels; this is a sparkling diamond hidden in the ruff and you will not find another like it. This fact alone should prompt anybody with critical taste and the desire to expand their mental, to watch. Ifyou take the time to complete it, you will not be sorry for doing so and will walk away feeling fulfilled in your finalization.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is broken into three parts. From the beginning, we come to understand the personalities and beliefs of our main protagonists as young men and women, and through the series, as they grow and prosper, those traits glue us to them, making their struggles a thrilling treat to consume. Their ideals, their outlooks and their differing placements in this universe is the pedestal that lifts these characters to heights difficult to reach. To say that Shinsekai Yori has compelling individuals would only be an injustice to their very product. These girls and boys are strong and beautiful, exciting and easy to relate to; by the conclusion of the epic, you\u2019ve felt like you\u2019ve walked through a lifetime with them which solidifies any dispute that the character development in this series is almost otherworldly.\\n\\n\r\nAnother point I\u2019d like to touch on is the voice acting. Usually one for subtitles only, upon first viewing, I wasn\u2019t caught. However, when switching to the English dub, I was rewarded with some of the most beautiful and passionate acting I\u2019ve had the pleasure of experiencing. Even our main enemy, a monster that goes by the name Squealer, has the gumption to outweigh most; with a creepy slight and hostile undertones, we\u2019re allowed to realize, from the start, that this monster is somebody who we can\u2019t trust. Each role perfectly embodies their characters personalities and projects them through verbalization, drawing us in and catching us on fluid words and a seamless script.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation wise, Shinsekai Yori is as breathtaking as it gets. Each scene oozes artistic prowess, making even more light-hearted and \u201cdull\u201d moments exciting to watch. At times, my breath was stolen away from stills alone. With fantastic color coordination, lighting and a sharp style, this piece isn\u2019t anything less than a crowning jewel.\\n\\n\r\nAdapted from a novel, the series has a very book-like, poetic flow in both script-writing and the events which take place. It works more like a three-part film than an episodic series. Each episode\u2019s conclusion leaves you clinging to the edge of your seat, eager to consume the next bout of detail. Working in the show\u2019s favor when you begin the next episode, it places you exactly where you left off so that there\u2019s no confusion or fishing for detail on what happened last. Because this was a novel first, the series is packed with incredible detail and the ability to flesh out points that might otherwise be murky.\\n\\n\r\nThough some moments are lighthearted, the series as a whole is rather conceptually disturbing. There\u2019s not much gore to speak of, but rather compelling, psychological concepts that will leave your mind and stomach churning. Spooky and dark, Shinsekai Yori was able to keep me alert and hungry for more. Less dramatic with imagery, it leans on its viewer being a quick and smart intellectual so that it can grab you with evil intent rather than brutalizing you with scenes of characters being torn at their limbs. Perfectly used to more gory anime, Shinsekai Yori struck me in a different way, twisting my mental and breaking my heart for the characters who must endure such sadistic intent.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is another gorgeous element. Both eerie and jazzy, all songs seem to capture each scene, drawing you in and fixing your emotions to coincide with what the characters are experiencing in that moment. There\u2019s this one song, marking the point of day in which each villager must return home, and simply thinking about it gives me chills. The Way Home is soft and warm, but captures the idea that something deeper is working underneath its calming chimes and warm tones.\\n\\n\r\nConcluding this review, I will state that Shinsekai Yori has been my favorite anime experience. And for reasons strictly due to the surprise and horror you feel watching, I refuse to spoil anything. From the animation to the script to the character development, twisting plots, fleshed out universe and magical voice acting, this series is one in a million and I would press anybody to embark on this epic.",

            "content": "This is a story where the antagonists are the main characters. Either that, or it flips up the romanticized notion of revolution. Wouldn\u2019t it be awesome to just go guns ablazing into Washington DC? Wouldn\u2019t it be fun to kill all the powerful people that dehumanize us, make us work in low wages and study in their jails called schools? Only we forget powerful people also bleed. Beautiful people suffer from rape, and famous actors develop anorexia.\r\nIf only we could change.\r\nOur relationship with beauty is odd. Although political bands make money off hating rich people, beautiful people may have more power. That\u2019s thanks to theHalo Effect. If we perceive a good quality in a person, it makes all other qualities look better and the bad qualities look a little worse. Throughout the anime, we see a bunch of pretty kids/teenagers do their stuff. They fall in love, they have a lot of sex and they have fun out in nature.\\n\\n\r\nCompare them to the queerats. It\u2019s not that they don\u2019t look human. They look ugly. They\u2019re desexualized, have rough voices and do manual work. Surely, such stupid and ugly creatures deserve their place. When hundreds of people die, we can\u2019t help but despise them. It\u2019s not like the people of the villages are evil. They\u2019re perfect, stick-thin intelligent people who care for the order of society.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cbut they all forget somebody\u2019s gotta scrub the toilets\u201d \u2013 BioShock.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is, at its heart, about power imbalance. Its way of exploring this idea is by deliberately making the powerful people sympathetic and appealing. There are two reasons for this. Evil people don\u2019t really exist. There\u2019s a coherent theory behind the oppression of the queerats. Also that often we won\u2019t rise up against powerful people because we love them. It\u2019s easy to hate the rich fat dude, but what if it was a beautiful women who enslaved people or send them to the gas chambers?\\n\\n\r\nThe faction you side with tells a lot about your preferences. The story is the basic old tale of the oppressed rising against their oppressors. If you\u2019re siding with the villages, then maybe justice isn\u2019t in your priorities. The villages are more appealing, more like how we want to be. If you side with them, you just might be a victim of the Halo Effect.\\n\\n\r\nIf you hate the humans and relish all the death and destruction, then you also missed another point. There\u2019s no difference between dehumanizing people for being powerful and dehumanizing them for being ugly. The anime makes the villains appealing both to reveal how the Halo Effect can make forgive terrible things, but also how people who do terrible things have their reasons for doing so.\\n\\n\r\nUnderneath all these philosophies of power there\u2019s also an emotionally engrossing sci-fi story. Shinsekai Yori is a great argument for how sci-fi can be about human relationships and drama, not just showing off about possible technologies. Sci-Fi isn\u2019t about predicting possible technologies \u2013 how a car works isn\u2019t a story. It\u2019s about how our society might look like if a certain technology emerges.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s about what would happen if we\u2019d become too powerful for our own good. If I were an expert in Japanese culture, I\u2019d say there are parallels to the atomic bomb. The Cantus is a genetic mutation that gives human beings ridiculous amounts of power, but you can replace it with any possible mutations \u2013 super-strength, super-intelligence \u2013 that will cause a power imbalance.\\n\\n\r\nEvery human in the villages is a ticking time bomb waiting to explode. Despite the peaceful exterior, danger is ever-present. It can coming from inside \u2013 one of us loses their mind and goes berserk. It can also come from above. The masters can take you away because they consider you a danger.\\n\\n\r\nWe humans have a hard time building an honest society. We feed our children a lot of things they later have to unlearn \u2013 there\u2019s no tooth fairy, the people in TV aren\u2019t your friends and schools don\u2019t teach you anything. The \u2018growing up\u2019 the kids do is realizing that the world isn\u2019t peaceful and cannot be. The Cantus is part of human nature. Reality is hostile from every direction \u2013 your servants can rise up, one of you can go berserk and someone from above can erase you from reality. You learn similar lessons when you grow up \u2013 the job market is cruel and being a programmer isn\u2019t enough, rapists can be sexy and you might get sent off to war.\\n\\n\r\nLike any other organism, we\u2019re constantly trying to remake the environment in our own image. By constructing a peaceful environment, we could ensure our survival. Utopian fiction often portrays these environments as a jungle of machinery and wires. So the main lesson we learn is that technology is evil, savages are noble and we all should be one with nature. The villages are \u2018one with nature\u2019. Technology hardly exists there yet the world is still hostile. Cantus isn\u2019t just a genetic mutations. It\u2019s a physical manifestation of the power we hold over each other. Organisms by nature are dangerous. No amount of sex or being one with nature or creating a class of ugly people can solve it.\\n\\n\r\nShinsekai Yori is so good that talking about the technical side is pointless. It\u2019s fantastic in how it explores its themes and anime like this are why I put so much effort into writing reviews in the first place. Every year a thousand works of fiction come out, and books or live-action movies may seem more mature but I doubt many come close to the lows of this anime. It\u2019s at once simple, emotionally engrossing and explores its themes to the fullest. There isn\u2019t a reason for anyone to skip this.\\n\\n\r\nIf only we could change.\\n\\n\r\n4.5 Queerats out of 5",

            "content": "The fall of 2012 is remembered by most as the fallen age of sword art online, and it is remembered by some as the beginning of psycho-pass. Some remember it as the year of love, releasing four sensational anime containing or immersed in romance. The following season may be remembered as the restart of gintama. Perhaps some remember the rise of love live.\r\nHowever, to me, save a single season, the entire year of 2013 will be remembered as the year Shinsekai Yori was introduced to me.\r\nShinsekai Yori, also known as From the New World, a well-known name given to the second movement of Dvorak's 9thSymphony, is, simply said without bias or of personal lenience, a masterpiece. It is the reason I immediately denounced Tomino Yoshiyuki's claim, father of Gundam, when he suggested in an interview that the former masterpieces such as Evangelion, Grave of the Fireflies, Ideon or Gundam will never appear again. He was wrong; it has appeared, and no one noticed. Not even the father of Gundam.\\n\\n\r\nShinsekai Yori's premise is simple; it's a retrospective future Japan, and it is the closest description to a utopia...on the outside. A world where the entire human species is capable of wielding PK, aka psychokinesis, referred to in the anime as cantus. It is a power only restricted by one's imagination, and as long as the user's imagery supports, anything is possible. It's a world devoid of worries of food or water or other necessities. It's a world without poverty or personal differences. It's a world neglect of crime. It's a perfect world......\\n\\n\r\nOr so you'd think.\\n\\n\r\nThe entirety of the anime is dedicated to revealing the facade of this make-believe utopia, with the message \"from the new world\" echoing to the past clearly and loudly:\\n\\n\r\nWhat would you do?\\n\\n\r\nA simple, short message that no one in the generation of people\"s\" could answer. Politicians tried and failed. Lawmakers tried and failed. Religions tried and failed. Kingdoms tried and failed. Democracies tried and failed. Civilizations tried and failed. Scientists tried and failed eternally.\\n\\n\r\nThe beauty of Shinsekai Yori is this: perfect depiction of reality. Generations have tried and tried and tried, utilizing every bit of emotional and practical resources throughout the ages with different civilizations and governance, and the result is a world engulfed in fire and ashes. The forefathers died at the hands of a tyrant for us to send more generations of youth into hell bent monstrosities. Our ancestors worked tirelessly for education, and in the end we were able to secure a worldwide system of brainwashing schools and parents. The firsts of us invented ungodly technological advances so that we may find the quickest and easiest methods in which we could ruin strangers' lives at the tip of our fingertips and convince the better part of our generation to buy items of \"priceless\" worth.\\n\\n\r\nThe future is bright and unknown. This has been true for every part of every generation. Future always holds the answers, the treasures and values unparalleled. Future is a rainbow; full of color, waiting for us in the roads ahead. It is, therefore, too late when we realize the terrible truth;\\n\\n\r\nThere is no rainbow. There is only ever the reflection of the past lights, past greatness, and basking in its brilliance is beyond our physical capabilities. We will continue to seek the future, longing for its brilliance, and it will be just a little beyond our reach, and it always will be.\\n\\n\r\nThe bright future will never reach us.\\n\\n\r\nAs for its demerits, the art is of no brilliance. It is certainly acceptable, as it won't be eye-cringing enough to stagger the storytelling process, but it is worth no praise either. It is one of those animes where the sole greatness of an anime is wholly contained in the story and not in art or sound or anything else.\\n\\n\r\nin discussion of sound, there is no noteworthy need to mention soundtracks, but it is without its flaws. The overall theme of mystery and terror is kept steady throughout the anime thanks to the wonderful compositions of three different artists, and the two character songs by the voice actresses Taneda Risa and Hanazawa Kana are of superb quality and of similar theme to the story. The art and sound are of no great quality, admittedly, but they do a wonderful job of adding onto the surreal, mysterious and screeching mood of the story.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Shinsekai Yori is a masterpiece. It is a perfect parallel of the real by the introduction of the surreal. It incorporates the complexions of the society without unreasonable claims. It was an unparalleled experience to watch this anime, and it is not a suggestion but a necessity.\\n\\n\r\nGo on and feel the reflection of our world, \"from the new world\".",

            "content": "Shinsekai Yori (From the New World) gives viewers a glimpse into a perfect society where everyone is gifted with psychic powers. Over the course of the twenty-five episode anime, viewers are treated to the story of five children, and the events that reveal the dark secrets behind their world. \r\nStory\r\n     The story that takes place in Shinsekai Yori is what makes this anime so special. Viewers learn about the society and its secrets as the five children\u2019s world is turned upside down. What follows is a beautifully crafted world that challenges the viewer's belief on themorality of a society\u2019s decisions for the greater good. Throughout the three main arcs of Shinsekai Yori, information of the world and brilliant foreshadowing from character\u2019s dialogue is presented all leading up to the final arc that combines it all for the amazing conclusion. After finishing the anime, I had the urge to just sit down and discuss with somebody about the choices of the characters, and the grey morality of the entire show. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters  \\n\\n\r\n     During the course of Shinsekai Yori, the viewer is shown the lives of five children who are all sorted into the same group for their school at the beginning of the show. Viewers watch as these children grow throughout the show, and are able to see how their ideas and beliefs change. The show focuses on the character of Saki Watananabe, and how the effects of one summer trip completely changes the view of the world her and her friends share. Watching these children grow into adulthood forms an attachment to the characters, and caused me to care about them when the danger ramps up later on into the story. By using Saki as the eyes of the viewer, we are able to learn about the world as she does, and by using different points in their lives we are able to see how the characters react to the rules of the society around them. \\n\\n\r\nSound   \\n\\n\r\n     The soundtrack for Shinsekai Yori is perfect for the world that exist in this show. Tracks like Going Home and Traditional Song of Shadows are perfect for the feudal Japanese village setting, and can give the feeling of dread in intense moments. Most of the voice work is well done, and each character\u2019s voice seems to fit their design.\\n\\n\r\nArt \\n\\n\r\n     The art design in Shinsekai Yori does its job of creating the village and its inhabints of Saki Watananabe\u2019s world. The design of the village shows how the citizens don\u2019t rely on technology anymore and live in a pre-technology Japan. The creature design does a great job of showing the new otherworldly monsters that inhabit the world, and the design of the Queerrats being my personal favorite. Each of the main character designs fit for their personalities, and makes a logical progression on how that character would look with each of the anime\u2019s arcs. \\n\r\nOverall    \\n\\n\r\n     In conclusion, Shinsekai Yori is an anime that will stick with me for a long time. The beautifully crafted world and its society built around psychic powers was extremely interesting world building for me. Watching five children grow up in this world while learning about how it came to be, and the morally ambiguous ways that the society protected this world provided an engaging story, and provided thought provoking questions such as \u201cDoes the ends justify the means\u201d and \u201cWhen does something count as being equal to a human?\u201d The show ends on an extremely satisfying conclusion, and makes the viewer feel like all the knowledge they learned of this world pays off in the end.     \\n\\n",

            "content": "This series seems to have received a lot of good ratings and while it was quite good at keeping you at the edge of your seat I have to say that it failed in a lot of aspects.\r\nArt:\r\nMaybe this is just my opinion but I thought the character design was not be suitable for the theme of the series. There are shows like Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica that also have this but the character design in Madoka was quite unique and it stood out making you guess. In Shinsekai Yori the character design is really common and it reminded me of some shoujo anime likeYumeiro Patissiere. This is the reason I say it does not seem very fitting. The eyes were huge, even for an anime and it seemed out of place considering the world they were in. I also noticed an inconsistency in one of the characters as they aged. Other than that I think I preferred some of the episodes where the art changed even though it was really strange and by the end it was a bit better. I really liked the backgrounds and the color palettes were really nice at times. Also, the character designs for the queerats were really good.\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nI think this is were I had a major problem with the show. First, it begins with one story arc and then it jumps into another one without having given a conclusion or resolution to the first one. In the end the first one is given a sort of vague resolution. The world that was being built in the very beginning lead us to believe something and then near the half of the series everything changed. It challenged certain views and morals only to throw them out of the window later on for the sake of a plot twist. I don't think it was bad but it was quite abrupt and it completely changed the theme of the story. In short the narrative didn't follow a clear pattern.\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI thought the first ending was really good and I really liked listening to it and there was also a track that I noticed and really made me excited so I would say there sound was very good.\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe characters were not developed enough in my opinion and there was a lot more room for their relationships to grow. Some things seemed abrupt again there were a lot of \"love triangles\" or something of that sort. Saki, the protagonist didn't have anything outstanding about her other than something that is mentioned later on. However that broke the rule of \"show, don't tell\" because I don't think it was depicted really well in the show that she had this sort of personality. Another of the main characters kind of seemed like a plot device to add into the angst rather than anything else which was a shame.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it was a good series but I was quite disappointed as it showed interesting theme which were explored poorly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Minimal spoilers here:\r\nOverall, I enjoyed this show because it sought to ask tough questions and explore dark themes. For example, what is it that makes us human? How natural is the order humans have established? To what extent is sacrificing humanity necessary for stability? Who holds truly holds power, and is that rule just? How does age impact perception of the world and its evils?\r\nAdditionally, I felt that it incorporated elements that make it unique from its other dystopian-world anime counterparts. Shinsekai Yori aims to introduce ideas like evolution into its main plot, something we don't typically see shows like Psycho-Pass. \r\nEven though the animestarts off with the protagonists as children, I thought it did a great job of blending in darker themes into the kids' adventures. IN fact, I think the show introduced its dark elements best because the protagonists were kids. The show definitely makes you feel like you're growing up alongside the characters, and there will be heart wrenching moments along the journey. Furthermore, I thought the relationship between the two main characters was beautifully developed as well.\\n\\n\r\nNow, my qualms.\\n\\n\r\nOne problem with shows that aim to provoke too many deep questions at once (with a limited budget and episode count) is that not all of these questions are answered and not all of these ideas are addressed as deeply as they need to be. My main issue with the show is that some of the themes from season 1 (e.g. proper perception of children, dangers of the subconscious) don't seem to get the justice they deserve in season 2 and the ending. Some of these themes were very prominently featured in season 1, but I felt as if they weren't fleshed out enough in season 2.Maybe it's because season 2's emphasis on an existential threat and the characters' maturation has changed their perception of the follies of society introduced at the beginning of the show. Still, it just doesn't feel like all the loose ends were tied. Season 2 introduced some thought-provoking, disturbing ideas too, but it felt mostly plot-driven to me. I could see that the creators were trying to show society's internal issues through the manifestation of the existential threat introduced in season 2, but it could've been better incorporated. Supposedly, humanity's supposed to make progress, but I don't see concrete evidence of how. I expect grand reform, but the reform feels so much more subtle and not grand enough at the end.\\n\\n\r\nMy other qualm, more minor, is the relationship between the supporting characters. Although they are featured prominently at times, they tend to fade out during others. Some of these characters appear so much that they end up acting like motifs, but I don't feel like the explanation of their continued appearance and role (long after they're gone) is explained well enough.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWelp, those were my thoughts. To sum it up, I enjoyed watching it overall, but I definitely felt like the ending wasn't quite satisfying for me. The anime aims to explore deep themes, but not all of them were fleshed out well enough towards the end. The shift between seasons both made sense to me and felt inappropriate at the same time. I could understand where the creators were going with the plot, but I wasn't quite satisfied with how season 2 ended.",

Although it started off innocent, we soon find ourselves entrapped in a convoluted story of ethics, justice, friendship, and love. This anime really goes after the flaws of humanity, and although it is set in a world that none of us have experienced, it is a society that is very much relatable to the reality we live in, making it all the more scarier. Each episode is another piece to the puzzle thatcome together beautifully in the last episode. The anime uses science and fantasy to build a sound and mesmerizing world that is very much complex. The right way is not always correct, much like in the lives we live and the oxymorons we face with each coming day. I have nothing but praise for this anime, and would recommend it to anyone, regardless of wether they like horror or not, as this is a very enrapturing piece of art that will appeal to anyone's humanity, as well as their fear for their own kind.",

And if someone from kids not good enough at school, they does not get a bad grade, but just mysteriously disappears.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: melodic and mysterious, and drawing: shiny colors, tones, lighting, landscapes, backgrounds, and gives a special atmosphere to anime. Everything displayed naturally, even homosexuality has a special, scientifically based and not at all distorted role.

It's as if you were olone in the dark forest surrounded by wolves, the only difference that in this anime are far deadlier things happening. Unnecessary clans of blood to make you feel the thrill.

Characters did not impressed me much, but unique atmosphere and  plot  makes one of the best anime titles of 2012-13. Would you like fiction, but not in space, mecha, star wars and apocalypse?

It isn\u2019t.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing that I think is brilliant about this plot, is the attention to detail. \\n\r\nEverything is well explained and somehow connects withg the story in the end. They have  a proper background history \u2013 emperros and previous empires, some mythology \u2013 which is proven not to be as mythological as the story develops \u2013 and a \u2013 freakishly - well structured  society. And is that society that happens to be the core of all this. I\u2019m trying really hard not to spoil any of it, but let\u2019s just say that in this anime we watch the consequences of trying to get an utopical society.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-wise, the main characters mays start as kids but they all experience this sudden growth, that obviously has it\u2019s price in some cases. As the story develops, Saki stands out more and more becaus of her curious ways, that arent that good in a society based in secrets.\\n\r\nYou can get moved for even a secondary character that appears in only one episode, because every character is portraied as human as possible.\\n\r\nThe Soundtrack really helps getting in your head with those whimsical songs and all those cliffhangers which I'm pretty sure gave me some white hair while I ha to wait to see the next episode a full week.\\n\\n\r\nOther thing about shinsekai Yori - and actually the thing that makes me love it the most - , is that you end each episode thinking about human nature. It really makes you think about ethics and how far can society go to achieve na image of perfection, passing all the possibilities implied with genetic manipulation. It\u2019s really hard to explain it without spoiling it, but mainly that\u2019s it. an anime that really makes you think.\\n\\n\r\nI'm no anime expert, even though I've watched some over the years, but I can guarantee you that this is the best anime I've seen EVER.\\n\r\nI think I'll rewatch it some times. that's how much I'll love it.\\n\\n\r\nSo, if you find the review even remotely appealing, go and watch the anime, I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019ll love it too.\\n",

            "content": "By now you've probably read the introduction to the show listed above:\r\n\"In this utopian village, strange rumors about a monstrous cat that abducts children circulate, and students are said to disappear from the academy. The world and its history are much darker than they appear and humanity is on the verge of collapse.\"\r\nThat in particular.  This is a spoiler free review, but I'm going to start off with this.  This show is absolutely not entirely about that.  The premise of some big cat being the antagonist slightly interested me, but this show was by no means a priority for me based onthat.  The show starts off as such, everything was pretty much as I expected, along with some cool surprises.  \\n\\n\r\nBut, that simplistic plot soon crashed.  What this show gets into is completely unexpected, and was an amazing experience.  I'm not going to say that what this show did was incredibly unique (honestly, I got a ever-so-slight Final Fantasy X vibe from it.  That in no way spoils anything, but some of the foundation kind of reminded me of it).  But even so, what they pulled off was amazing.  Every major detail this story had got a good amount of attention.  It was at times kind of hard to keep up if you weren't paying attention, but I loved the depth behind everything.  I felt like there was a story behind every house, brick, etc.  \\n\\n\r\nThe story developed well.  Initially, while they're exploring the incident with the big cat, it was interesting, but by no means something that kept me guessing.  While that incident is still important, other things occur is when I was on the edge of my seat.  There were many scenes in this show where I was holding my breath because the situations were so tense.  \\n\\n\r\nEverything aside, I really loved the message this show conveyed.  Just when you feel like you know who the enemy is, they give you a different perspective on things.  Which isn't surprising considering they used a certain establishment to base humanities civilization on.  The last episode left me in shock, not because they revealed something I slightly expected, but because I didn't expect the sudden shift in perspective.  I'm so used to shows ending in a predetermined way \"Bad guy looses, good guy wins, the end\".  The formula doesn't entirely apply here.  The morality of everyone's actions was a common problem in the show (not that they were beating you over the head with it surprisingly enough), and ended on that note.  It was a really great way to carry the story and its characters throughout the show.  \\n\\n\r\nEven with all that, I can't say I was too attached to this show while watching it.  For all its depth, I didn't really feel completely attached to the characters.  I don't know if this was intended or not, but as much as I enjoyed them, I had a hard time feeling too much remorse for them.  That was kind of a problem being a show based on the darkness of humanity.  That isn't to say I didn't feel anything, but I can't say I really had a favorite 'human' in this show.  I absolutely had a favorite character, but it was from a place I didn't expect.  Long story short, I was interested in what happened next, occasionally an episode ended on a cliffhanger and I had to tune in immediately, but that absolute investment wasn't there for me.  \\n\\n\r\nThis show may seem extremely shallow just reading the short bio, reading a couple reviews, or even watching the first few episodes.  However, there are a lot of really great surprises that you can't even comprehend without giving it a chance.  I'm so happy I decided to give this show a chance, I have a feeling you'll feel the same way after finishing it.  It's a great story that really gets you to think while watching it, which is very refreshing.",

            "content": "Shin Sekai Yori is a show I\u2019ve dedicated a lot of time to as a blogger. The task of writing a post on each episode every week was made a lot easier by the fact that I actually really enjoyed it, and always had something to say about it! I actually had too much to say about the show at times, which is why I\u2019ve now decided to write a review on it. I\u2019d like to be able to compile the most important thoughts I\u2019ve had on the show during those 25 weeks into one post. Who knows, maybe it will help someone reading thisto decide whether or not they want to watch the show? One can only dream!!\\n\\n\r\nI won\u2019t waste time by giving you a synopsis- if you want one, read it here on MAL- I\u2019m just gonna launch right into it!!!\\n\\n\r\nThe strongest aspect of SSY was definitely its story. Well, less its story, more the themes it incorporated into it! It frequently used its characters\u2019 actions to make comments on human nature, comments like: humans are evil, if we\u2019re given weapons, we will definitely use them because of this, fear of our destruction will lead to our destruction, etc. And because none of this was said outright, discovering them provided me with a certain satisfaction!! I know many prefer not to think too deeply about shows, but even though the story, at face value, is interesting, with plenty of twists and turns that make it difficult to predict what\u2019s going to happen next, I would strongly recommend taking the time to ponder over what you watch, because if you\u2019re anything like me, the story alone, without any deeper meaning, won\u2019t be enough if you can\u2019t bring yourself to care about its characters, which I\u2019ll elaborate on shortly.\\n\\n\r\nThere were two other things I really liked about SSY\u2019s story. One of these things was that, as the story took place over a span of just under a decade, it really felt as though you\u2019d gone on a journey with the characters by its end. The other thing was that the writers really knew how to get inside your head. It\u2019s strange, even though the human characters in the show often felt artificial (again, I\u2019ll get onto that soon) it really felt as though, at times, the writers understood what it meant to be human, especially in regards to fear. The show could be wonderfully creepy at times simply because the writers understood what we find scary, and exploited that. Pain, darkness, monsters, the unknown, being trapped, being pursued- all things we universally find scary, all things regularly used to create fear!\\n\\n\r\nThe weakest aspect of SSY, however, was its characters. Right up until the end, I\u2019d not heavily invested myself in a single one of them! Frequently they\u2019d be placed in life-threatening situations, but I just wouldn\u2019t care. The problem was that some of them didn\u2019t display enough of a range of emotions for them to feel convincing as characters- Mamoru, for example, only ever seemed to display fear and uncertainty- and some of them could have done with their motives being fleshed out more- like, why was Satoru such a compulsive child, but such a composed and reliable adult? I just felt as though I hadn\u2019t been given enough to get behind them as characters. But I suppose that\u2019s what happens when most of your characters are just vessels used to further the storyline, or emphasise a point\u2026\\n\\n\r\nSaying that, there was one character that stood out, Squealer. Everything about him made him a superb villain: his voice, his appearance, his behaviour\u2026 everything! Firstly, given that he\u2019s a queerat, it was more difficult for us to identify with him, secondly, almost every time he opens his mouth, he sucks up to the humans around him in this sickly sweet tone of voice that just feels wrong, given his sinister appearance and questionable actions- it is obvious from the start that you can\u2019t trust him- thirdly, although I complained about the show not making enough of an effort to tell us what motivated its characters, this wasn\u2019t necessary with Squealer, a little twitch of his eye, or a slight grin was enough to make you think that he wasn\u2019t completely on the level!! But as his motivations were rarely made clear, it was difficult to pinpoint why you felt this way, and it was this uncertainty that made him such an interesting and unnerving character to watch.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of its art, SSY was pretty darn good. Its backgrounds were often stunning, and the nightmare and storytelling sequences looked incredible! The art was extremely varied during these sequences, making use of monochrome and bright, contrasting colours at points. Some of these sequences even reminded me of famous works of art. The storytelling sequence on karma demons reminded me of a Seurat painting (the artist who painted using dots of colour), and one nightmare sequence, one of Salvador Dali\u2019s. My only complaint is that most of the characters weren\u2019t that interesting to look at. This relates back to what I was saying about them not displaying enough of a range of emotions. Because the only expression some characters seemed to wear was one of fear, they quickly became very boring to look at!! It was a nightmare as a blogger to find screenshots to use in my posts, simply because of this lack of variety!!! I think if you look back at my posts, week after week I\u2019ve had to use screenshots of Saki looking scared, which is quite funny, in retrospect!\\n\\n\r\nOverall, a very good show! Worth watching if you\u2019re looking for a visual treat, or something with depth. Avoid if you\u2019re looking for something simple and light-hearted, you will not find it here!!",

            "content": "Shinsekai Yori is one of the most intelligent anime I've ever watched. The dialogue, the plot and characterization are all top notch. None of the main characters feel like flat cardboard cutouts. An example is how the main characters often debate about the motives of other characters, trying to predict what the next actions of other characters may be, and the right way to act so as to achieve their objective. Characters such as Satoru, Inui and Kiroumaru for example are very strategic in their thinking and almost everything they say and do is entirely rational. The plot is very good, logical and consistent. Theplot is not particularly convoluted like in some detective stories, which is a good thing as it makes the story more easily checked - there are no loose ends that I could find, everything is neatly tied up by the time the anime finishes. \\n\\n\r\nActually the main reason I watched this anime is because of the violent scenes involving psychokinesis. These are regrettably few and short. I would have preferred more and longer violent scenes. This is one of the few shortcomings of the series in my opinion, is that it shied away too much from violence and gore. Also the music isn't very good, like, I wouldn't listen to them outside of the anime. But the voice acting is okay. Saki can get annoying but then again she is probably the most emotional character in the series, if you ignore her and focus on the other characters you'll find the anime very enjoyable. And at the end of the story she becomes a conduit for Shun anyway, so at least she does something useful. There is some feudal allegories that may or may not be relevant in the modern world, depending on which perspective you look at things. Satoru says at the end that monster rats are not humans may or may not have significance depending on whether if you think that all homo sapiens are truly human or not. Mamoru and Maria having dun goof'd was probably the \"darkest\" part of the anime, plot wise, but really it could have be much worse, considering some things people have done in real life.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all an excellent anime that I would recommend for anyone who likes an intelligent plot, intelligent rational characters, or violence (although there are only about 10 seconds of violence throughout the whole series added together, these scenes are admittedly pretty gratifying).",

            "content": "Originally a novel Shinsekai Yori or From The New World is not an anime I would usually get into but when I was left with no computer for almost a year I ended up satisfying my anime needs by buying the Rogers Anime on Demand. Which contained no shows that peeked my interest enough to watch or continue watching them. Then I decided to give From the New World a watch to see what it had to offer. \r\nStory:\r\nWhen the anime began I found it rather boring but since I had nothing better to watch I continued through the episodes until it got to episode8 which I will talk about later. One thing I liked about this anime is how you see how the main characters grow up over two seasons of the anime from young children to adults. You can see their world and overtime how it works which is a big step seeing as it is set in the future and would have to have a lot explain in the ways this anime succeeded at doing. It seemed like an average anime nothing special about it until episode 8 where things get much deeper and I was so shocked over the huge 180 this anime decided to take, which paid off in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nStarting off two dimensional for me I really never thought when I began watching this that I would love these characters as much as I did. When the anime takes its dark turn and characters begin to face terrible fates you can't help but feel sad about what is happening to all these characters and almost feel the same pain as Saki. I have to say episode 8-11 for me had to be one of the saddest parts of the anime. When the main characters begin to forget a past you as the viewer watched happen you just can't help but wanna cry cause you know the characters aren't coming back. Shun, Satoru and Saki were my favourites but Maria and Mamoru didn't really do anything for me, they still were good characters but weren't as good as the other members of the main cast.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI do like the art in this anime but I still feel like it isn't anything special or the best art i've seen. It looks very different from the anime style we usually see its nice but not at anime standards. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nNothing special about this soundtrack wasn't exactly up to my standards still fit with the anime and it wasn't like it was ear bleeding to listen to it was nice it fit in the background of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: \\n\r\nThis anime is one of the best animes i've seen in quite awhile it really does kill you on what these characters have to go through overtime. The anime has a way of making you convey emotional turmoil for all the characters and really there has never been an anime for me in quite a while who had done it this well to me before. I suggest you give it a watch atleast until episode 11 if you can't really understand the story or feel empathy for the characters  I'd be surprised. Please give this a watch!It's something new and refreshing for those of you looking for an anime with compelling story and characters. If you don't atleast try it trust me you'll be missing out.",

            "content": "Shinsekai Yori looks like a almost perfect anime, almost. It's not a very popular choice and it's a shame, because it is an anime that a lot of people could very much enjoy.\r\nThere is something different about this series, something mysterious that draws your attention.\r\nIt actually stands for what it's called, it's a story from the New World.\r\nIt's crazy how this series will treat you with new information as the time passes, this anime will slowly show you the truth behind everything, this series is based on words, every single word counts, you need to listen carefully.\r\nBecause the New World, is a different world.\r\nSCORES\r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nBasically youfollow a story of a group of children. They live in a society where people can use telekinesis, they actually polish that ability in schools, that tends to be the only thing they learn at school. This society could be called an \"utopia\", perfect society with perfect families, perfect virtues and perfect decisions. \\n\r\nBasically no big deal, they have some really nice lives and it's pretty good.\\n\r\nThey main protagonist try to deal with the psycho powers and the \"perfect\" society they live in.\\n\\n\r\nVIBE:\\n\r\nWell, you get the \"mystery\" stuff very much while watching this. I like the feeling that something is on, but you are not really certain what. It's very unpredictable and you can't really come up with what will actually happen next. I like that tension, it makes you wanna know what's next, so you keep watching with interest.\\n\r\nThere were no jokes around, which I liked, sometimes in animes you get that really serious plot which drags you onward to watch the whole series in one day, and then it is all destroyed by a ecchi joke.\\n\r\nNo, youre not getting that here. Every single second of this show is grave serious, no jokes, only plot matters. And then there are emotions.\\n\r\nAnd like the best ever character development, best freaking ever.\\n\r\nOverall it's the one I like the most, serious, without any interruption of a bad joke.\\n\r\nI dont mean that I hate bad jokes, I like them, I just hate them when they are in a place they were not supposed to be in.\\n\\n\r\nART STYLE:\\n\r\nHey, it's one of the prettiest animes out there, that is what I think at least. The best thing the managed to do here, is the growth of the characters. Well you follow their lives, so you will see how their looks develop, and that was done quite accurately, I loved that myself.\\n\r\nNot only that you can experience a beautiful scenery of Japan presented there, loads of forests, loads of mountains, and magnificent sunrises. \\n\r\nIt was one of the best visual experiences Ive ever had.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC/VOICEACTING:\\n\r\nThe was no opening music, which is a shame, I tend to love these, but the music was pretty awesome! They had a repetitive motive theyve gone with (made like 5 different tracks from the same theme, just changed a bit), but it is awesome, I myself love what they had in store. A choir of children combined with drums and bells, it matched vibe quite well.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION:\\n\r\nIn the conclusion I can say that it's a series you can really enjoy while watching it in the evening, with the lights turned off. It's an anime that lets you think about different aspects of life. And it's a anime that will surprise you, there's a lot of plot-twists there.\\n\\n\r\nVideo Review: https://youtu.be/nD6kLe_gf4w\\n",

You have to understand ~ That isn't something I throw around carelessly. From the very first episode I was captivated by this dark and twisted tale of love. It stands as the only anime to hold my attention to such an extent that I ended up watching the entire show in one sitting.. I just HAD to know what would happen next.. I've never been gripped like that before it wasa wonderful feeling to say the least. Quite often that wonder was accompanied with dread and sadness. This anime will build you up and then break you down piece by piece. I cannot speak another word for I fear I will spoil your enjoyment of the anime. I believe everyone should go into watching this anime just as I did.. with absolutely no expectations of what the show is about. Go into it as a new born baby that is experiencing life for the first time .. and come out of it as a war hardened man... or woman :)\\n\\n\r\nDISCLAIMER: This show is incredibly DARK and as such is NOT recommended for children under 15 years of age.",

            "content": "First of all, I would say that Shinsekai Yori, is a thoughtful masterpiece, but an animated disaster.\r\nThis anime encourages you to think inwardly, to think deep, to think about your morals, your character, and to judge what is right and wrong in whatever situation. That's all fine and dandy, and they even throw in lots of variables to complicate things and confuse you a bit. That's still okay, the anime may seem quite heavy in terms of its dark atmosphere, but so far, we're still surviving.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nWhen we talk about the plot, most of us would think, \"Wow that was amazing.\" But upon careful discretionwe will see some key plot holes that surface. The society itself that they are living in is greatly flawed, the so-called system that seems to be flawless at the beginning, exposes itself to many loopholes as the story progress.\\n\\n\r\nIt is difficult to think that human society AFTER our current modern era has retrogressed in terms of intelligence, and still is surprised at the thought of a democracy/monarchy... and so on. This incoherence is further emphasized when we see the adults, which the story uses the excuse of \"fear\", causing them to make mistakes and result in horrible tragedies.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, I don't buy that. \"Fear\" is one thing, but as Tomiko has shown \"experience\" is another that probably trumps over all fear. The key conflict in this series only starts like in the last quarter of the entire series, and that is some really screwed up pacing, if you ask me.\\n\\n\r\nSure, they took a long time to develop the characters, which I would give full marks for, but it completely detracts from the plot so much. The characters grow up, they change, it's all good, but I mean cmon, within the transition periods the characters learnt absolutely nothing? Time jumps are an absolute no-no. The anime should have completely shortened the first 3 arcs of the show into maximum 6 episodes (about 1 quarter of the show).\\n\\n\r\nPlot holes are generally unexplained, but well hidden. They try to cover up many things by talking about the \"inhibition\", \"fear\" and even the main characters' morals. But common sense only seems to exist within the queerats and not the Cantus users. \\n\\n\r\nFor example, humanity as they know it takes perfect care to ensure that the epic disaster never happens again. Not bad. But - they forget contingency plans - there is no evacuation route, there is no communication lines, there are no steps, procedures to follow in the event of an epic disaster. In short, disaster and crisis management has gone out the window. Humanity is driven to the point of extinction because, even though they managed to come back from near extinction before, they have not learned their lesson of \"survivability\" which includes \"having a back up plan\".\\n\\n\r\nAnother example, the source and origin of Cantus is never explained. It just seems to be this weird innate power used for crushing the weak, that stems from absolutely nothing, apparently. A huge energy source, created from this \"awakening\" of sorts via a mantra. So basically, everybody is a \"God\". Excellent. And these \"Gods\" would ultimately become useless because they really suck at using their powers - which they have been training their entire lives for. The anime literally shows like about less than 25 people who effectively use their Cantus in any combat or battle situation. That's pathetic and very sad.\\n\\n\r\nThe above two main plot holes justify my giving of the story a 8/10 instead of a 10/10. I have a lot of other plot holes that they haven't addressed - proper explanation of how the final \"fiend\" was \"extracted\" from her parents, explanation how such out-of-this-world sea monsters ever came under queerat control, explanation of why Cantus users need to use waterways when they obviously can fly, explanation of why Cantus users need boats, when they obviously can levitate above water, explanation of why Cantus users don't have planes or helicopters when they have weird-looking boat submarines already, explanation of why Cantus users are unable to escape effectively, even with the use of Cantus, explanation of why Cantus users constantly tire and run out of energy when Cantus is essentially an unlimited source of power which the anime keeps stressing on. If I were to be REALLY fair with this anime, it would deserve a 7/10, but I felt that since the anime was told \"in Saki's perspective\" I can concede that Saki probably would not have known all of these things (although she probably might have known some), so I did not penalize for ANY of these plot holes, when I actually should.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, if you watched the anime and DID NOT pick up any of the plot holes above, you are just not thinking enough about this anime.\\n\\n\r\nStill, I give them bonus points for being able to gloss over quite a few plot holes and not have anyone notice (you probably won't notice it, but some things are unexplained and just dropped off halfway through the series after a time jump). Even the resolution at the end, though it felt good, was not complete - have they really explained everything that came together, the big plan by the queerats at the end, how did it practically take shape? - I feel there are many ways their plan could have just failed in their tracks, but the story does not bother explaining these.\\n\\n\r\nIt was a very good story, but not perfect.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nEnough said, the character development was solid. Although the main characters' whiney nature is really annoying at times. It is btw, completely inconsistent with her \"strong\" yet \"weak\" nature. It doesn't make much sense - sometimes she breaks down and is terrified, other times she suddenly has a strong sense of conviction in spite of great danger, I mean, if you grew through your experiences to become stronger then good for you, but this girl just keeps switching from useless to useful, it just seems like it's all for the convenience of driving the plot. But still, good characters.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5/10 and Sound: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art was confusing at times, really. All those dreams that the main character is having makes me want to puke. The Music, was meh, it hardly had any OP, though the ED was just fine. So I give it half points. Same for the art. It lacked a lot of animation and was pretty dull. Also, the background music I found really annoying for some reason, it was just that same old stretched-out melody, with action-packed music being completely village drummed out. I mean it suits the whole tone of the anime but it really bores me to death.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing for the first half of the show was really slow, and really bad. And then the pacing for the latter half was very slow, then very fast, then very slow, then very fast... and so on. The story could have been driven much better if it didn't gloss over so many key moments, and it explained situations a whole lot better than just a huge narrative that bored me to death, seriously. I had to literally FORCE myself to continue watching past episode 6, and I guess it was slightly worth it. (I would have given this anime an overall score of 4 if I hadn't continued, but I promise the anime does get better towards the end, but still that's a bit too long to expect me continue. PLEASE HOOK ME IN AT EP 1, not at EP 20. cmon!)\\n\\n\r\nI know this show is supposed to make you think, but I really find that narrator's voice of the main character talking in 3rd person all the time, really annoying, useless, and I find it cheating that the narrator literally gives you more clues about the story itself, than the actual visuals that I see.\\n\\n\r\nNice plot twist at the end though, though it wasn't pretty big, and was mostly predictable. I give it a bonus 1 point.\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nWatch it if you really like questioning your own beliefs and if you have a LOT of time. Also, a lot of buddhist references at the start -> it is hard to imagine a POST-MODERN era to still be holding such religious/ritualistic approaches. But okay, since it had to be about hypnosis and whatnot, I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that it was merely a practice and not a belief (this is again a plot point that was never explained and just glossed over)\\n\\n\r\nSo be prepared to be really bored for the entire first half of the show, but after that, the characters really shine (or should I say what's left of the characters... hahahaha)",

            "content": "Very good science fiction that doesn't pull any punches and trusts in the viewer to be able to put the pieces together.  Very well told and conceived - outside of things like psychokinesis, even the science used is within the realm of abstract possibility. Character deaths are often abrupt, but never happen without furthering the plot and making deliberate points. Everything seems to be in service of the underlying story.\r\nMy only complaint, and the thing that kept me from fully enjoying the show, is the main character, who is as bland as stale Wonder Bread.  Characters continually mention how amazing she is, buteven they have a hard time coming up with any reason she would be amazing. \"I guess I would call it strength,\" they say. But Saki is often the first to break down, and is more often than not the most cowardly and useless person in any situation.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting and antagonizing characters are much more interesting, with Squealer and Kidoumaru being prime examples. In the end maybe that's the point.\\n\\n\r\nShinsekai Yori is a largely unheralded gem of modern animation, and is well worth a watch.  Ultimately, it's a story about how to know when you've lost your way, and a cautionary tale that we must always protect the core of our humanity, which is in the end what all great science fiction is about.",

            "content": "I'm writing this seconds after finishing the anime. Through tears of not quite joy and not quite sadness. Let me start off by saying that, it took everything I had not to already write this review 9 episodes in... because honestly by the 6th episode I was 100% sure that this was in fact the best anime I'd ever seen, and would become my all time favorite. Now that I've said that, I'll start the review.\r\nOkay, so the story. I honestly have no words. If you're into philosophy and the question of human morality when it comes to not only us, but other species.. well,honestly this anime beats them all. Every episode made me \"wow\"... It's not so much because the ideas are unique, but rather beautifully executed. It felt like each episode inspired me in my own writing imagination. It has a somewhat Gulliver's travels idea to it in a morality sense (but I won't spoil it more than that). Other than that, everything about the time-period was executed beautifully.. and in 25 episodes you somehow got an amazing story with so many different layers, that never felt like there were holes in the plot. Each episode felt like it lasted 3 minutes, and I couldn't wait to see the next one. It was jam packed, yet flowed evenly, and managed to never feel rushed.\\n\\n\r\nArt. So some people might dislike the art, but I think that the way it's drawn is necessary for the type of anime it is. I loved it, and it had a lot of really beautiful backgrounds and scenes.. and the way the characters moved was very free and loose.\\n\\n\r\nSound. Soundtrack was amazing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: While some characters didn't get as much spotlight, the show wasn't trying to fool you. You knew who the main characters were, and you knew which characters influenced them and why. You really saw them grow in the time skips.. and spoiler: there were points where you felt like you knew why THEY were the main characters when seeing other characters in certain later episodes. Every character had a really different personality. Also, idk if anyone else noticed their resemblance to the original group in digimon, but I did. haha.. Either way, you really felt for the characters and didn't feel like the writers were lying.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime had everything I've ever wanted in an anime. It would have made a great book too, I'm sure. It had action and romance and tragedy and some scenes that made you happy. It definitely wasn't a fun loving anime, but there were definitely points that touched me.. in a way that made me smile. This anime definitely isn't for anyone looking for just entertainment, because there is WAY more to it. If you're into animes that make you think, and wonder, while keeping you on the edge of your seat and guessing different outcomes... this is it. Also, it wasn't always so obvious who you were routing for, which made the relationships and viewpoints realistic. I wouldn't say it ends \"Happy\" but it ends how it's meant to end in the best of possible ways. Definitely not a sad outcome though depending on how it could have ended.\\n\\n\r\n10/10 would recommend.",

            "content": "This is my first review here and English is not my native language. I'll try to make it as objective and spoiler-free as possible.\r\nLet me start by saying that I cannot fathom why this anime has received so many rave reviews. The show starts awfully slow and the story doesn't progress until very late in the anime. There seems to be no clear direction as to where the plot is taking you. You, the watcher, can't help but to feel confused and begin to wonder why are you even watching this particular anime in the first place.\r\nShinsekai yori takes place a thousand years into thefuture. A small percentage of the human population evolved and gained telekinetic powers. After endless wars against non-psychic humans, they rise to power and eventually rule the planet. This is revealed to you through the series and is not particularly important until the very last episode.\\n\\n\r\nWhat you will be watching and following most of the time will be a small group of teenagers enrolled in a school to learn to control their telekinetic powers, referred to as Cantu. Bear in mind, thou, that this show is not action oriented and is not meant to be a pissing contest between Cantu users to prove their powers. For this reason, if you are looking for a flashy anime with cool characters, Shinsekai yori is not for you.\\n\\n\r\nThere are no memorable characters worth mentioning. With no one to root for or care about, you are only drawn at the premise of a compelling and unique story. But after sitting through 25 episodes, it just left a bitter taste in my mouth. The plot is dark sprinkled with short bits of surrealism here and there. With the seemingly omnipotent powers of Cantu, the only real threat to humans is their Cantu going out of control. This serves as the center point of the story.\\n\\n\r\nThat seems interesting, right? Well, I thought so too. There was so much potential here, which sadly was wasted with the introduction of...mole rats at the service of humanity. Yes, read that sentence again. Mole rats. That final revelation at the last episode, which I wont spoil here, doesn't change anything at all or diminishes the silliness of the whole thing. You have to juggle the dark and (at times) interesting parts of the story focused on the Cantu and it's mysteries, and the ridiculous and almost comical parts focused on the mole rats.\\n\\n\r\nThe show takes its sweet time to raise questions and answer them. I found very few plot holes or unanswered question, but in all honestly, I cared less and less about the story as it progressed. The first half of the show is the most interesting and thought provoking part of Shinsekai yori. It definitely caught my attention and got my hopes high, if only for a moment.\\n\\n\r\nIf you find slow-paced psychological anime with lengthy dialogues enjoyable, you might want to watch this. However, don't expect your mind to be blown apart by it's not-so-deep plot and/or lack of witty twists.",

            "content": "While looking up the description of Shinsekai Yori, we see that it is considered to be in the horror genre. Normally, the first things that pop up in your mind might be: blood, ghost, lack of storyline and that it might be not scary at all! Except, the moment you first watch an episode of this anime, you can sense a unique vibe that guides you to watch another episode. From the New World (in english) depicts a dystopia as if you were a true member of its unique society based on the power given by the \u201cgods\u201d\r\nStory- 10/10\r\nThe story if a one of akind. Sure, the subject of a said \"Utopic society\" has been used ten thousand times in our life not only in animes/mangas/light novels, but also in occidental literature, movies and TV shows. So, of course things might get repetitive: a young person finding out that he/she lives in a futuristic place that looks and sounds marvelous, but turns out to be horrific, we all get it. The difference here is that, yes, it takes place in the future, but the fact that we see a group of young people (around 12) finding out that their divine powers have destructed an ulterior society and that their own community based its rules on horrible and terrifying principles is pretty uncommon. Even though some scenes of it might be tough to understand because of their paces, the thoughts given to the storyline are brilliant. A masterpiece to keep you in suspense from beginning to the end.\\n\\n\r\nArt- 10/10\\n\r\nMy oh my, what beautiful graphics have they used here. The vivid colours and the outstanding vibrancy in pretty much everything is just fantastic. These things put an extra plus to this anime series because not only are they here to put the viewers in a trance (which is kind of what you want in this anime) but to put a \"je ne sais quoi\". Think of it as a mood. I'd personally say that without the art used in this series, my opinion would absolutely be different! \\n\\n\r\nSound/music- 9/10\\n\r\nA creepy mood combined with classical music and choirs? Who would\u2019ve thought that something like this would be that effective? Something interesting that we do not encounter that often in the anime world is the non-existence of an opening. Yup, you heard me well, so don\u2019t think that at some random point they\u2019ll put one\u2026 But the fact is that they replaced this almost mandatory factor by some scenes and that just puts the mood to a high standard. Although, the creators have added endings (which, don\u2019t get me wrong, are very beautiful in an artistic way), but from my opinion\u2026 they were not that great... But still, the mood the soundtracks put during the multiple troubling scenes was a necessity.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- 9/10\\n\r\nThe personalities given to each and every characters that we\u2019ve seen in this unique work of art are very important elements since it\u2019s kind of a psychological anime. Although the characterizations were a little vague during the multiple arcs, we cannot deny that the creators did put a lot of efforts so that the numerous main and supportive characters have a significant nature which could change the whole plot of the story. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nPretty much during the entire time I was watching this anime, I kept wondering what would, could and will happen. There was no particular time I said to myself \u201cit will obviously be this\u201d or \u201cOf course, they are SOOOOO going to do this\u201d and that was something that was very interesting. The fun in this is it kept triggering your mind. Plus, maybe lying and saying to yourself \u201cjust another episode\u201d 15 times in a row can also pretty much depict my level of enjoyment while watching it\u2026 so, no need to add more words\u2026 \\n\\n\r\nOverall- 10/10\\n\r\nFinally, I highly recommend you to watch AT LEAST one episode of it during your spare-time even if horror is not your thing. I personally really liked it and all of the little details they put up together was pretty much the main aspect that I noticed and enjoyed\u2026 I really do not have anything else to say since everything you need in written just above\u2026 :-)\\n",

            "content": "Well, this will be a difficult review... but let's give a try. First a disclaimer:\r\nYes, two guys kiss in one episode. It is sad that many people dropped this show only because of a 10 second scene. If you are homophobic, don't even start reading here and go try to be a better person. Curious is how \"two girls kissing\" is ok... oh you people. Now that we are done here, let's go:\r\nStory 9/10\r\nShinsekai Yori takes place 1000 years in the future, where the society returned to a more rural state, and religions like Buddhism and Shintoism are once again predominant. But what makes thisworld so special is the fact that everyone now has telekinesis power, called Cantus, and how everything works around this ability, specially how to control it. There are children disappearing, demons, supernatural killer cats, a strange new humanoid race, Mantras\u2026 and this is only the beginning of the mysteries.\\n\\n\r\nThe best part of Shinsekai Yori is the world where the story takes place, since it is all surrounded with a dark mystery, where most people are unaware of the secrets of their society. With the eyes of the group of five children, we also start to uncover the true nature of the place they live in. But here is the first problem of this show: Despite it was sold as a Horror and Psychological show, it barely has any of this elements. Drama and thriller are the predominant genres here, and they are really competent in these aspects, working with the tragic consequences of the children's discoveries in the show. Also, by the time you reach around episode 18 there won't be anymore mysteries to be revealed, except for a last and awesome revelation in the last episode.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10\\n\r\nSo... if Shinsekai Yori isn't all about mysteries, what else it has to offer? Well, there is another intelligent race living in this world, and they are called Queerats. They are like animals with some humanoid characteristics, that live in tribes in the forest and all their acts are monitored by the humans. And here lies two extremes aspects of Shinsekai Yori:\\n\r\n- Best: The final arc. It is full of action, drama, violence, tension and everything you would expect for. Even better, the final revelation of this anime brings us a good chance to reflect upon everything that happened and we can even try to bring it to our reality.\\n\r\n- Worst: Pacing. Pace is a huge problem in this show, specially when the protagonists are interacting with the Queerats. While we are all looking for the mysteries and thrilling scenes, we have to spend a bunch of episodes watching the kids running in the forest and talking with Queerats. To makes things worse, in the beginning you can't tell if these episodes are relevant or not, until you arrive at the final arc. If they were able to develop the mysteries and the Queerats problems together, definitely we would have a better result in the end.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10; Sound 9/10\\n\r\nThe sound is really competent, it is able to create the mood of melancholy, tension, and brings a kind of \"epic ancestral religious\" music over the show. The art is really beautiful, and the absence of colorful places and clothes makes everything even more melancholic and sad. But the quality of the animation is unstable, and we can notice many episodes with a lack of quality (and many of them are in the Queerat parts).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 8/10\\n\r\nThe characters are ok, they fulfill their roles, but I couldn't develop a stronger link with any of them. Saki is a strong female lead, while Satoru and Shun are the most intelligent ones in the difficult situations. Mamoru is the fragile one, while Maria is more cheerful. There are some other minor characters, but most of them shows up only to die 1 episode later. The Queerats Kiroumaru and Squealer are probably the most interesting characters, since that they are the ones who are the cause of the final conflict, and we understand their point only a few minutes before the ending of the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nShinsekai Yori is a really enjoyable show. It brings an interesting world surrounded of mysteries, that are uncovered little by little, and which their consequences bring a good drama for the plot. It has some problems with the instability of the animation quality and pacing, which causes some let downs while watching it. The secondary plot, which turns out to be the main plot in the future, surrounding the tribes of Queerats is a huge problem that turns out in a good and interesting conclusion, that you are able to enjoy if you put in your mind that this show is not only about mysteries.",

            "content": "So this is how the world could be if Psychokinesis had taken over...\r\nShinsekai Yori takes place in the future - in the very distant future. Interestingly it does not really look like the very distant future; rather than the distant past, before electrcity and that stuff had been invented.\r\n1000 years passed... and people have not changed at all. For instance: they believe in almost the same things as they did back then in 2010. They have not grown over those years or have not made any usages of the modern technology to rebuild their lives after Psychokinesis had almost wiped out humanity (or was onits best way to do so). No TV, no superdimensional computers or futuristic architecture appear in the monitor in front of you. To sum up: People in 1000 years would rather go back in the forest and live under trees - using boats in order to cross (or \"drive\" on) the river and so on - than using the enormous \"power\" of our modern technology. The basic idea of this distant future story might have been pretty interesting and surely had a lot of potential and freedom to make use of it.\\n\\n\r\nWith this being the case, just shows us that there was never much room for an utopian, 24 ep-lasting serie in the distant future. Thus, after the first four episodes, the serie eventually turns into a political, action-packed drama which involves a romantic drama as well with very simple characters. \\n\\n\r\nHaving said that, this leads us the next issue: the characters. They were generally likeable, but definitely not memorable. The anime is told from the perspecitve of (almost) Saki only. There are, however, a lot of other characters stumbling through this Anime; therefore, it would have been nice to get some insights of other characters. Or a proper farewell since some of them just disappaer.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was really inconsistent. Also, there was a guest director for some of the episodes, and while one of them was really good, one of them was not. Notably episode 5. \\n\\n\r\nAnother notable episode is definitely episode 8. It is not mainly due to its subject matter. It is rather due to the fact that there was no lead-up to what happened. There was simply no explanation, no clarification for what they did; or why a certain person has a certain feeling for someone else. And as suddenly it started, as abruptly it ended.\\n\\n\r\nBesides these problems, there are notable things which serves the anime quite a bit. The sound does deserve indubitably solid praise and the serie has a well used voice cast. Sound effects, however, were rather decent. \\n\\n\r\nThe first few episodes need to be praised for its really well-directed, excellently edited and accentuated musically atmosphere. It makes you feel uncomfortable watching it and furthermore shows the seemingly endless power of Psychokinesis in its own true nature. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Shinsekai Yori cannot be classified as bad since the start was very well done; but it is far from being a masterpiece and cannot fully satisfy its more critical viewers.",

Animation, art, development - all meh. It seemed like they wanted to cater it to a gender neutral audience but I don't think they nailed it. Failed to attract me much.\r\nI was only interested in the setting and the premise; how this world came about, what was truly going on and such. At certain point I found the humans and main characters - especailly Saki, so very foolish.\r\nOh yea and a warning, there is a shortbut somewhat explicit BL kissing scene.",
