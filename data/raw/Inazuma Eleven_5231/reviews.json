            "content": "I started to watch Inazuma Eleven out of pure boredom and ended up with a total obsession. You don't have to be a soccer fan to like it (to tell the truth I really dislike soccer ...) or to have an understanding of it. \r\nThe story was, well, surprising. It is a bit unrealistic to use soccer for world domination or try to kill kids because of soccer but it is an anime - it doesn't have to be realistic. At first, I was really annoyed by seeing soccer-playing aliens (2nd arc) who destroyed Japanese high schools like they couldn't use their power for moreprofitable purposes. Of course this made no sense at all on the first glance, but in the end it was surprisingly well resolved. \\n\\n\r\nBesides the story is only secondary. Inazuma Eleven focuses on the characters, which are unique and well designed. There is a character development and even though there are a lot of characters the show managed to balance quantity and quality. Everyone has his own story and his own problems to overcome. I really loved this show because of its characters and would give it 20 out of 10 points if it would be possible.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I recently had the pleasure of watching Inazuma Eleven for a third time and I can safely say it is still as evergreen and exciting as I found it the first and the second time I watched it. \r\nPresented by Oriental Light & Magic, the studio that gave us Pokemon, Inazuma Eleven has been a huge success in Japan and several other countries and it has good reasons for so. \r\nThe story is centered around a young and energetic football freak, Endou Mamoru, who is trying to gather members for the local school football team; The Raimon Junior High. With his charismatic personality and never-givingup spirit, Endou with the help of a few soccer buddies manages to find eleven players to play for the club and to aim for the Football Frontier Tournament. Football Frontier is a competition where all the junior high schools across the nation participate in order to achieve the number one position in the whole country. But before they could even participate in the tournament, they are pit against the famous Teikoku Academy, which is currently the best in the nation and have been winning the tournament for 40 successive years. Things do not go as planned however for Raimon as they are completely overpowered by Teikoku in all departments of the game. Shoot after shoot, goals after goals Raimon players get battered brutally with an overwhelming margin of 20 goals to nil as Endou Mamoru could only watch his friends lying helplessly not able to stand across the field. As everything seems over before it began for Raimon, an unexpected twist occurs as Gouenji Shuuya, the talented striker who swept away all his opponents single-handedly in the previous Football Frontier Tournament while still just being a freshman, takes the field wearing a Raimon unifrom. It seems that Teikoku was waiting all along for him to take the field and as he does an inspired Endou Mamoru catches the ball cleanly hit by Teikoku and throws it straight at Gouenji who then with this amazing shoot makes the goal. Teikoku then abandon the game as they got what they had come for, and thus resulting in a victory for Raimon Junior High. This is the beginning of the adventures that await Raimon and Endou Mamoru in his future. \\n\\n\r\nThe are three different arcs in the show - The Football Frontier arc, The Aliea Academy arc and the Football Frontier International arc. \\n\\n\r\n(i) Football Frontier arc: Follows the journey of Raimon Junior High as they take on the local school teams to enter the competition and play against the best of the nation and their journey to the top.\\n\\n\r\n(ii) Aliea Academy arc: Follows quickly after the Football Frontier Final against Zeus Academy as various schools across the nations including Raimon Junior High is destroyed supposedly by \"Aliens\" who say to come from the far planet of Aliea as the messengers of Aliea Academy. They use a Soccer battle as the means to conquer the Earth. There are five teams in Aliea Academy; Gemini Storm, the second rank team that are the first to arrive. Epsilon (Also play as Epsilon Remastered in the later episodes), the first rank team and the rest are Diamond Dust, Prominence and Genesis which is led by Hiroto, are the three master rank teams.\\n\\n\r\n(iii) Football Frontier International arc: Begins after the victory of Raimon against the Aliea Academy's Genesis and players around the country are gathered to form the Inazuma Japan which is the national team of Japan. The arc follows their journey as they progress through the Asian preliminaries and face the teams from all over the world.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters play a pivotal role in the series as is the case in every anime, and each of them have their own unique personality and appeal. \\n\\n\r\nGouenji Shuuya: The cool-headed striker with great potential and also known as \"The Flame Striker.\"\\n\r\nEndou Mamoru: The Goalkeeper and the protagonist of the series. He is also the Captain of Raimon Junior High. \\n\r\nKidou Yuuto: The brains and the genius strategist of the field. He previously was the Captain of the Teikoku Academy but now is an irreplaceble addition to Raimon Junior High. \\n\\n\r\nThese are just the main three characters of the team and there is the rest of the team as well consisting of Kazemaru, Someoka, Handa, Max, Kabeyama, Shourin along with several other members that join Raimon in the future. \\n\\n\r\nEndou Daisuke is the grandfather and a former soccer player-cum-goalkeeper for the Japan National team and it is he whom Endou looks upon as an inspiration and decides to be a goalkeeper himself.\\n\\n\r\nKageyama Reiji is the main antagonist of the show. Kageyama's father was once hailed as the future of Japanese football and that is before when a group of exceptionally talented players gathered by Endou Daisuke overpower him and he is descended into darkness. This leaves a huge mark on a then young Kageyama as he grows deep hatred for soccer in his heart and vows to use any shrewd means possible to take his revenge and to sit on top of the soccer world. He is the owner of the Teikoku Academy and is mostly called as \"Commander\" by Kidou Yuuto and the rest of his players. It was him that taught Kidou his soccer and made him grow up to be a prodigy. However the sense of self-righteouness earned by playing against Endou and his friends, Kidou vows to leave Teikoku and follow the right path and to play his own soccer. It's pretty ironic actually that the villain whom you will hate for the most of the show then turns good later in the show in what was an absolutely heart-wrenching episode to say the least. I could not hold back my tears at that point and most likely you won't be as well. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound aspect of Inazuma Eleven is one of its strongest assets. The soundtracks used between the episodes are brilliant and it won't be an exaggeration for me to say that Inazuma Eleven has one of the best set of soundtracks in anime. Furthermore, it also boasts of six top-class openings performed by T-Pistonz + KMC. Two of my favorite top 5 anime openings are from the show. They're simply classic. The ending themes vary from person to person as they're all aimed differently for both boys and girls. The voice acting again in this anime is top-notch. A lot of budget was put into this and it clearly verifies it by the class of the voice actors. Each of them is a pro and and you're most likely to find them in any other anime you see. One of the main example is the voice of Endou, which is the same voice actor popular in his role for Naruto in the Naruto franchise. \\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is done well throughout the series and has a simple characteristic look aimed at the teens so nothing too special about them. The football while in a soccer match is done neatly and there is no use of CGI and everything is kept simple which is the best way. The \"Hissatsu Techniques\" as well are drawn beautifully and never under-achieves. \\n\\n\r\nInazuma Eleven is like a dose of childhood to me, I can keep watching this numerous times and it won't disappoint me in a slight way. If you're a football/soccer freak like me then this series is a must see, even if you're not then as well I'd recommend you to watch it. It's very exciting throughout and with the addition of the cool Hissatsu moves it only adds its reputation and for me it cements its position as  one of the best sport anime out there. \\n",

            "content": "Before \"Inazuma Eleven\" came along, I always thought \"Captain Tsubasa\" represented very well the football issue (\"football\" in UK, \"soccer\" in USA). It still does, altough it can be a bit boring sometimes (the first episodes of the 1983 version are unforgettable)\r\nBut in my opinion, so far, \"Inazuma Eleven\" is really the best, with \"Ganbare Kickers\" coming in second place. Sure there's a bit of exageration with those football moves when playing a game, but the football game moments are nice to see (nice sound and art as well)\r\nWhat's really the best is the story out of the football games combined with a great castof characters (when a character is included, the story only gets better): there's some great moments for comedy and drama in there\\n\\n\r\nJunko Takeuchi is always great when she voices the main character, Endou Mamoru. No wonder: she also showed that in \"Hunter x Hunter\" (Gon Freecs) and \"Naruto\" (Uzumaki Naruto)\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, a great anime and hoping for more suprises in it",

            "content": "In December of 2015, I decided to pick a bunch of non- seasonal anime that I wanted to watch alongside the Winter 16 anime season. One of these series was Inazuma Eleven.\r\nNow I went into this anime with very low expectations due to the fact that I don't like sports that much plus some of my least favourite sports are football, boxing volleyball and baseball. So I was expected to hate this anime because of it. As again I don't like sports that much and honestly I was expecting to kinda hate this anime. Was I wrong in my personal judgement or I am right?\r\nStory.\r\nThestory in Inazuma Eleven follows a cheerful goalkeeper captain named Endou Mamoru who is looking for members to join the Raimon Soccer Club. However due to Raimon Soccer Club only having 6 players the student body council president named Natsumi threatens the Raimon Soccer Club by disbandment if they wont win a game by Teikoku Gakuen as well getting enough players. When Raimon recruited enough players they faced off with Teikoku Gakuen however Raimon Soccer were competently outclassed. When all hope was lost at the very last second a striker named Gouenji helps the Raimon team to score a point using a powerful hissatsu technique called Fire Tornado. Shocked about the power Teikoku Gakuen forfeits the match where Raimon Soccer Club won by default. This gives Endou along with the Raimon Soccer members hope that they will one day win the Football Frontier. From there Endou along with the Raimon Soccer members would aimed to become the best soccer time like no other team ever was.\\n\r\nInazuma Eleven is split up into three main arcs as well as some subplots that take place during the main arcs.\\n\r\nFootball Frontier Arc (EP1-26)\\n\r\nAilea Academy Arc (EP27-EP65)\\n\r\nFootball Frontier International Arc (EP66-127 End)\\n\r\nHonestly, the story isn't the strongest part of Inazuma Eleven. I am going to be real honest it's one of its weaker parts of the story especially in the earlier episodes of the first arc which I found to be cheesy at times but at the same time, I just can't help to really get invested by it.\\n\r\nThe first half it execution. In my opinion, you can make even the most boring sounding setups really good if you can get the execution just right and Inazuma Eleven just that. Honestly, I don't care if the sport is realistic or not because for I only care about the execution more than anything else\\n\r\nThe other half are the subplots and in my opinion, they are some best subplots I have ever seen in any anime. They are just really handled well, and they add life to the characters which prevent them from being boring and generic shounen characters.\\n\r\nAll of the arcs were all very enjoyable to watch and they well directed because each arc knows to use its content really well.\\n\r\nThe show explores the theme for friendship, teamwork, value as well as overcoming your fears and weaknesses and this show manages to execute them perfectly.\\n\r\nI really like the story for this one even though it\u2019s on the little basic side for the most part. I don't think much more was needed because the execution of it was so well handled specially in seasons 2 and 3 where the writers decided to go all out.\\n\r\nGreat job director Katsuhito Akiyama.\\n\r\n8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\r\nThe characters are what really brings this show together because like with the story it is the execution was great.\\n\r\nFirst, we have Endou Mamoru who is our main captain for the Raimon and later on Inazuma Japan as well as being the main goalkeeper for the team.\\n\r\nEndou starts off as a goofy and kinda hot-headed protestant who has a passion for football but honestly as the series progresses he developed from a less goofy hot-headed main protagonist to a very determined and more responsible captain for the team. I actually adore this character because he is a well-developed character and a lovable one.\\n\r\nI was really impressed with Endou as a who and that's why I adore him and he's one of my favourite\u2019s characters in the show, to be honest.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNext up we have our main striker for Raimon Gouenji Shuuya\\n\r\nNow like Endou he has a strong passion for football but unlike Endou, he's much calmer but self-centred but as the series progresses he much friendly to the team as having massive character development. Not to mention his subplot and backstory was just great and well told.\\n\r\nOverall Gouenji is a great character on he\u2019s own right.\\n\r\nLastly, we have Kidou Yuuto who is the brains and strategist player for Raimon who is formerly the Captain of the Teikoku Academy but now is an irreplaceable addition to Raimon Junior High. I can only say this much to this character because he is a walking spoiler character which he's side plot. Besides the one that I just mentioned because it happens early on the story anyway.\\n\r\nAll I can say about Kidou is he is an amazing character and he is one of the few complex characters.\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters are hit or mess depending on your tastes.\\n\r\nFor me, most of the characters were great because they had they own subplots which are well written for the most part and they fun to watch as well as being well developed. Sure there were a few miss characters but least they didn't damage the show for me.\\n\r\nThen we have what is easily my favourite characters in Inazuma Eleven. Kazemaru Ichirouta.\\n\r\nI honestly have grown attached with this because I just really liked how his very friendly as well as being competitive player not to mention I really adore his character design.\\n\r\nIn my opinion, Kazemaru is probably the most realistic character in this show personality wise.\\n\r\nOverall the characters were awesome.\\n\r\n9.5/10\\n\r\nVisuals.\\n\r\nVisually Inazuma Eleven is pretty good.\\n\r\nThe art of Inazuma Eleven is fresh and surprised greatly because I like the character designs for the most because they feel fresh and original.\\n\r\nOne thing that I liked that is the use of colour for each arc representing the mood and the tone of each arc.\\n\r\nThe football frontier arc has bright colour feel it to it but not full colourful while the Aliea Academy arc has a more depressing feel to it. Then we have the football frontier arc international arc which has more modern sports anime feel to it because of the colour usage and the art, in general, has greatly improved in terms of quality.\\n\r\nThe animation was surprising really good, and it stays consistent all the thought and when they players use hissatsu techniques its freaking amazing of how well animated they all are. Sure at times can use re-use the hissatsu animation but for a show like this, I didn't really bother me too much because they are amazingly animated.\\n\r\nAlso the character designs, for the most part, were great and unique.\\n\r\nSure there were a few questionable ones, but they didn't really bother me too much.\\n\r\nThis is by definitely Oriental Light and Magic finest work in terms of art and animation especially in season 3 (Football Frontier International Arc) where it looks absolutely beautiful at times putting some of the recent anime to shame at times.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the visuals were great.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nThe first time that I listened to the OST I personally found it lacklustre but over time I started getting used to it and I ended up completely loving the OST because how amazing it was.\\n\r\nHell, some of the tracks in Inazuma Eleven are emotional and just plain epic.\\n\r\nNotable tracks include.\\n\r\nTeikoku Gakuen Theme Empire Gakuen came!\\n\r\nMortal combat with the empire Gakuen\\n\r\nLethal Attack\\n\r\nGathering Circle\\n\r\nKanashii Kano\\n\r\nAll of the Opening and Endings themes are amazing. \\n\r\nMy favourite openings and endings in Inazuma Eleven are opening four and ending 1 because they fit very well with each other like the opening 4 adds hype for that arc while ending 1 closes that arc perfectly.\\n\r\nThe Japanese audio for the series was great, and the voice actors were well acted.\\n\r\nNotable Seiyuu performance goes to Junko Takeuchi as Endou Mamarou, Hiroyuki Yoshino as Kidou Yuuto, Sanae Kobayashi as Natsumi Raimon, Rie Kugimiya aka (Tsundere Queen) as Toramaru Utsunomiya, Yuki Kaji as Kazuya Ichinose and Nishigaki, Yuka as Kazemaru Ichirouta.\\n\r\nThere's also an English dub. Please don't watch the English dub it's really bad. I watch the dub for this on Nintendo's anime channel just to see how it is and it was just awful. Not only the voices were bad but the audio quality itself is bad plus the story and characters development were butchered to all hell.\\n\r\nAll of the characters have different names, and they were really bad on that and the final nail of the coffin for this dub is the show cuts off after season 2 leaving you with an uncompleted story.\\n\r\nI only watched the first 2 episodes for the dub for this I dropped it half way in the episode because the voices were just so freaking horrible to listen plus the voice actors had no emotion with the roles whatsoever.\\n\r\nSo there really no reason to watch Inazuma Eleven dubbed, and I won't take any points away because it's honestly hard to find an Inazuma Eleven dub nowadays let alone good quality.\\n\r\nOverall besides what I said about the dub the I really love the OST, Openings, Endings and voice acting for the original Japanese audio\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts.\\n\\n\r\nInazuma Eleven might just be the anime that I realize I judged this too early.\\n\r\nAm being really honest when I say that my opinions for this anime went from basically is just another mediocre sports anime to oh my god l freaking this anime so much!!!\\n\r\nSeriously this went being something that I will hate to something that I will love, and it impressed me in so many ways that I will never think possible with a sports anime let alone a kid\u2019s anime.\\n\r\nThis is just an awesome anime that I barely speak my praises enough. The story, the characters, the animation the OST, the openings the endings and the voice acting were all just great. I know it could easily have flopped, but execution for everything is so great.\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a great sports anime that is entertaining and has a strong character cast I recommend Inazuma Eleven. It was a great series that I will forever love until the end of time\\n\r\nFinal Score 9/10\\n",

            "content": "Inazuma Eleven is what you would expect from a kids' sport Anime. Full of sparks and over-the-top flashy moves, but little to none substance or story depth. I'm totally not against the characters having super powers, but when this overused feature starts damaging the actually good on-going action, it doesn't work for me. The characters can apparently freeze time or increase the length of the soccer/football field so they can do one of their signature techniques (which makes no sense by the way, it just alter how strong the shoot will be, apart from some few dribble moves). I was also bothered by the repetitiveformula that the anime kept after the first arc. After awhile, the final scores of the matches became futile as we all knew our heroes would emerge triumphant. I found myself urging for something unexpected to happen, but everything was just painfully predictable. \\n\\n\r\nThe Anime, however, kept me insterested into it because of how amusingly absurd it was. I also enjoy this touring around style, so I got that going for me.",

            "content": "This anim\u00e8 is one of the most annoying i have ever seen. It starts of like all other shounen series, but maybe the first one i have seen where the main character still have both his parents. Its about Endou Mamoru, a goalkeeper for a pathetic football team threatened to shut down if they can't get enought members and beat the best youth team in Japan. And that's how it starts, and escalades into one of the most dreadful manuscripts ever. \r\nThe story is not bad because of lack of characters or the lack of plot. But the story itself is just utterly unrealistic. Itsnot about the football in or of itself, but more of the evil people plotting terrifying plans behind the courtain. The plot really pisses me of, and i can guarantee you, if you are not a 9 year old boy. You will get annoyed. \\n\r\nSometimes you would rather tear out your eyeballs and feed them to pigs than to watch particular segments of the episode.\\n\\n\r\nIm not gonna give you any spoilers, but this series is farther away from perfect than Pluto is from the Sun.\\n\\n\r\nBut that is why i love it. I don't take it seriously at all. Ok, ill admit it. I always cheer for Endou and Inazuma Eleven/Inazuma Japan, even though i KNOW they are going to win. But i don't take the manuscript seriously at all. It's brilliant, watching evil people plotting to KILL children because of a youth club football match. It's so unrealistic that i cannot  describe how annoyed this series get me, and i kinda like that feeling to. I want to jump into the screen and knock some sense into them. But this isn't what fuels my \"need\" for this series. It has heart and soul, it got all the right messages morally. Even though you sometimes think the characters are abit one-dimensional. \\n\\n\r\nI don't even think the writers take themselves seriously. I think they blurt out ideas, laught at it, and make it fit. From one moment you are on a football field, the other, on a crime scene. Under pressure by a all powerfull leader that wants to take over the world. \\n\\n\r\nBy using kids... on a football field.... \\n\\n\r\nYou take my point?\\n\\n\r\nTo sum it up.\\n\r\nSTORY-2- As you already have figured out, the story is dreadful. \\n\\n\r\nART-9- I have no complaints about the artwork, some of it are pretty cool. The different \"Hissatsu techniques\" are pretty cool-looking, and good animation overall i must say. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND-8- My main focus when i watch anime is story and how much i enjoy it. But it's all relative, and you can't enjoy an anime without good sound, and i think they did a decent job here. I personally can't put my finger on any major flaws.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER-8- Shounen, everything from evil cocky guyes, to overtrusting guys who relies on their friends, and would die for them. Etc\\n\r\nBut it works on all other shows, so i see no reason why it shouldnt work here\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT-9-I have already explained why i enjoy this, i can disconnect my brain and just watch this, laught at the stupid plot.I give it a 9, because some scenes make me want to crush my computer in anger. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Inazuma Eleven is my greatest accomplishment in anime with its 127 episodes. I can\u2019t remember why I started it, but here I am, 127 episodes after. Yes, 127. That\u2019s one point you must consider before starting this anime.\r\nLet\u2019s begin with the plot. To summarize everything, some aliens came from outer space to destroy everything on Earth with a soccer ball. The team \u2014 that we are following \u2014 must stop them from doing so by winning a soccer tournament against them. You must be thinking it\u2019s funny. You\u2019re right, it is.\r\nMost episodes are soccer matches but sometimes there are some extra spices where they developcharacters, and in so many episodes, they have enough time to do so for everyone in the team. But characters are generic and it isn\u2019t that worth following them. A great example is the leader who can\u2019t stop believing in friendship\u2026 Dear God, how many sh\u014dnen have that annoying character? Of course, thanks to him, while they are always losing in the first half of their matches, they understand the power of the heart in the second half and win\u2026\\n\\n\r\nOne good point in Inazuma Eleven is that you can watch it even if you don\u2019t like soccer. After all, this anime is unrealistic so this is mostly based on production values to be entertaining. There are good voice actors, soundtrack has also some entertaining themes (though there aren\u2019t enough for its length). Animation is fluid, special techniques used in soccer have also great visual effects, no doubt about it.\\n\\n\r\nThen, if you ask me if I liked this anime, I can barely answer. On one hand, the plot isn\u2019t moving on and is terribly repetitive, on the other hand, production values managed to keep me watching this series through the end.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: Inazuma Eleven is an average anime; it is kids-oriented but not like a fairy tale or an original movie from Ghibli that we can still enjoy without being a kid anymore. You are now aware, it is not meant for people seeking for quality. Most kids kill some time watching shows on TV, I\u2019d say Inazuma Eleven is one they should avoid to play real soccer instead.",

Must be pointed out that the setting and the way in which the small players Raimon and the other teams are moving quite reminiscent of those of the movie Shaolin Soccer, with shots that become necessary secrets and balls of fire, ice, penguins with appear from theground to accompany the dynamics of the shot.

            "content": "This is the first anime that I ever watched online. I was in love with the anime on tv, and unfortunately it only aired early in the morning at 6 am, so I set my alarm clock extremely early every time just to watch it. Unfortunately the dub version wasn't that far in my country, and I had to watch the rest of the show online. Glad I did.\r\nThe first thing I want to say is that I'd rate the sound of Inazuma Eleven the highest of all. In fact, out of all animes that I have watched so far, there was no anime Iwould rate the sound of as high as in this show. It used the opening and outro theme songs in the middle of episodes itself as well, which can make me love an anime over 9000 times more. The soundtracks were perfectly fitting with the scenes, and also beautifully orchestrated. I sometimes still listen to some of the soundtracks on youtube, or sing hum them out loud. The opening songs are all enjoyable as well.\\n\\n\r\nNext up is the story, which I don't rate that high. Some things are unrealistic, or found way too far, as if the makers had to come up with something, no matter how realistic, to make something else that's cool possible. And the whole second season doesn't make a lot of sense, but no spoilers on that. The difficulty scaling could be better too. Apart from that there are some touching scenes, characters have good background stories and their own strong personalities, and the connections between characters are strong as well. The art-style isn't outstanding, but pleasing to the eye and enjoyable, and every character is unique, a.k.a. every person has their own unique appearance and amazing hairstyle.\\n\\n\r\nI highly advice you to watch Inazuma Eleven. You can feel the tension on the soccer field. The amazing supernatural techniques can be so awesome, ranging from fire tornadoes to ghost hands, that you want to repeat them on the field in real life. When the main characters score a goal, you just want to cheer together with the crowd, and you feel bad for them as well when they loose. Simply one of the most enjoyable animes I've ever watched.",

But when I got past the first 3 episodes it began to get interesting. The show introduces tons of characters, whereas you will see some re-appear again, and some will get tons of spotlight. Around 50% of the characters will get an in-depth background story, which allows the characters to develop even further. \r\nThe main thing in the anime is soccer, at first I thought it would be plain ball kicking, but thenthey added \"abilities/skills\" to the ball kicking. It really caught my interest, that there were 200+ different abilities the show had to offer. It led to a big variety, which certainly keeps the show interesting. And the animation on those abilities were just fantastic. I was like O_O at them all.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is really good, although it may get \"boring\" on the long term, due to some parts being really predictable. But every single Arc in Inazuma eleven was fantastic. I especially love the way different soccer teams were introduced, and their main \"theme\" by that I mean Jungle team, horror team and much more.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is fantastic, and it really spices the show up, whilst also adding tons of atmosphere for the X situation in the anime. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I really enjoyed this anime, and can definitely recommend it.\\n\\n",

But as it happens I came across this anime while watching TVTokyo at 4 in the morning waiting for Bleach to come on. At first I thought it was ridiculous but it really got me hooked. This series is not like any soccer anime you might have seen before. It is over the top, most the characters develop super powers (but only when they play soccer), and often times they just throw the actual rules of soccer out the window. Butthat's what makes the show, its just over the top fun. If you are in between watching animes and just want something lighthearted to watch, then this is probably the show for you. The series follows a story but for the most part each episode has it's own plot so you can pick up the series whenever and still understand whats going on. Personally I just pick it up in between more heavy shows just to pick my mood up.\\n\r\n     This is a recommend for everyone. Ya, it's a little kiddy but who really cares. If you like a show that takes something normal and blows it completely out of proportion then you will probably like this show. Just go turn it on, I promise you won't regret it.",

            "content": "So there's a whole lot of animes that present about sports, mainly Football or Soccer (Well, they're both the same though), since the 19th century. And as far as i know, there are, (The rather famous) Captain Tsubasa, which has been done in many remakes (Particularly in graphics), Hungry Heart, and Shoot!. Well, that's all i know so far, actually. And now, which i want to review it to you, there's the Inazuma Eleven (Inazuma11 for short), which in my way of point, is rather odd.\r\nStory (3/10)\r\nI don't know where to start, exactly. Because this is... well, what it is actually, is one of thesection where i didn't like about the anime. What sicks me out actually, is it's a junior football game, where most bad guys, is soo obsessed in \"Killing\" the good guys. I'm sorry, but it's a football game! In my childhood, me and my friends is maniacally in love with Captain Tsubasa, because it's SIMPLY cool, and nothing extraordinary... despite the shooting effects, of course. Then there's this....\"Powers\", where it didn't explain itself of \"How the hell did he do that!?\". For example; there's this kid who can make Kagebunshin (or if you're not a Naruto fan, it's something like self-cloning/multiplying... thing) to overtake a single person to take the ball from him. And there's this keeper, who can \"Summon\" thousands of aura-hands to capture a single shot. Well i'm sorry, but i'm TOTALLY prefer to watch Shaolin Soccer rather than something trying to be like one, who is not even close to, even if it's an anime.\\n\\n\r\nSorry for not mentioning the REAL story review, because other than being a spoiler, it's just a standard kids show: Reaching to the top, or like Being a No.1.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nNot to underestimate the Art & Animation, though. For a kids show, it's very top notch. Everything is so smooth and clean. And they take the camera angles very nicely. Although, some fillers take the roll repeatedly in some episodes, which will makes you think something new isn't coming. Fortunately, this rarely happens.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nWell, it's the same as the Art & Animation does, good qualities is in it's package.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (6/10)\\n\\n\r\nBasically, this is a child's anime....sort of. So it's obvious that the character designs is to be made for kids to like, which in our current age, is of course, rather weird. And of course, most of their attitudes is mainly focuses on \"NEVER GIVE UP!\", which is fine by me, since it's of course, good for children development.\\n\\n\r\nAnd as i said earlier, the antagonist is pretty sarcastic, or rather sadistic for a junior football game. Which is pretty annoying..\\n\\n\r\nSo that's the Character, and now we're moving on.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (4/10)\\n\\n\r\nHow do i put this? It's ridiculous on it's story and the characters, but at the same time i kinda like the idea and the concept of the overall anime, which is something the anime didn't make it to what they're after. Well, i assume kids will like it though, but just imagine if they watch this, and they get obsessed with playing soccer, they're definitely going to ask their parents, \"Dad, why can't i summon my clones?\". Why? Because like i said, the anime didn't explain itself about how those powers work, and technically, it's totally magical. If kids watch Captain Tsubasa, they'll find it out eventually how things work, like how Tsubasa could use the Drive Shoot, it explain itself how the technique works, 'cuz the theory is real (although some elements in C. Tsubasa taking it too much thx to the effects).\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall (6/10)\\n\\n\r\nSo overall, it's not so good, but it has it's own unique concept of how football game can be.... on the other world. But truthfully, kids will like this. But always remind them: It's not going to happen.",

            "content": "I don't have any interest in soccer, neither having a reason to watch a kiddy anime while I'm, in fact, 17 years old, especially I like the dark, action theme animes instead of sport and light-hearted shows. My first meeting with IE was when someone used Fubuki Fanart as signature and it looked really beautiful ( I was deceived lol). My first thought was \"WTF is this, so ridiculous\" when watching IE GO. And yet, I was hooked by it, watched the whole IE GO series, and then watched IE. I would say, I love IE more than its sequel.\r\nI didn't expect a sport serieshas a plot beside \"Lettttt's playyyyy gamesssss\", and yet, IE proved me wrong in many, many ways, especially the alien Arc, and I was like whatttt. Surprisingly, the arc ended up pretty well with the most reasonable solution that we can get and with all the character developments. The plot is never boring, in fact, you couldn't get bored because of how likable the characters are, how fun the hissatsu are to look at, and how the matchs are not really predictable. I couldn't guess whether the Raimon would win or lose in the Alien Arc, and maybe Raimon actually lost more than won in that arc. However, I think the reason that makes the plot successful is the pacing. The longest match would only be 3 and half episodes, and there would never be a moment that looked like the match just stops for characters to monologue. That is also the factor that makes some sport animes look like they're buying time (Kuroko no Basuke, Yowamuda Pedal, Diamond no Ace...). And yet, in fact, they actually said in the interview that they were buying time by throwing a random match in, but we would never realize (LOL). I also like the fact that the series doesn't treat us like kids, they already say \"it's a super-dimensional soccer, and this's how IE world works, deal with it.\" That's why, even though it's ridiculous, we can accept it, while some serious animes out there, trying to look as realistic as possible, but end up having unrealistic powers (KnB - no, I don't hate it, I have the whole mangas, but it's the best example) and stupid reasons and twists that comes out of thin air (Gunslinger Strator, Valvrave...). IE doesn't treat itself serious, and that's why we can easily accept it later instead of the annoying feeling hanging in our throats. The balance between goody and sad moments is also perfect, it never gets really bitter and makes us hard to swallow, while keeping the depth in characters' personalities.\\n\\n\r\nThe most thing I like about the series is the characters, and I can feel a strong connection to somes like Fubuki, Kazemaru, and maybe Hiroto, and sometimes I would just wish I have a friend like Endou, he is like a sunshine to everyone. In a show that have so many characters, you wouldn't expect all of them will have backstories, and yet, in IE, all of them would always have one or at least time to shine, although the story would only focus on certain one, like Fubuki and Hiroto in Alien Arc...This wonderful character developments is thank to the amount of episodes, because it's more effective when it takes long time for them to surpass their fears, like in reality. We can't easily change in such 1 or 2 episodes, like most short-term animes love to portray. Fubuki did take nearly 40 episodes to finally change, and his struggle takes like 10 episodes, continuously trembled and couldn't face soccer direcly. However, the director did a perfect job in expressing his deep fear, and we would never yell at Fubuki \"Godarnit get over it already.\" I was sincerely hoping he would get over his fear somedays soon, and when he finally did, I was really happy, and decided to change myself like him. Also, the character's design are really cool, even though it gets overboard sometimes lol, but at least we can easily recognize who with who.\\n\\n\r\nMusic is also a strong part of the series, and I would say the music director did a really great job in inserting the OP and ED in the matchs. Many times, the music make me feel goose bump during the match, when it's not actually that exciting. As expect of one that did the music for many series! The OST are just fun to listen to, and there are some piano songs that really nostagic whenever they're played in sad parts. \\n\\n\r\nThe weakness of the series would be its animation, but it never gets really bad as some A-1's shows, so it's okay.\\n",

            "content": "Inazuma Eleven tells the story of a ragtag group of junior highers on the verge of having their club disbanded -- unless they win an impromptu match against the school that holds a 40 year championship reign. It\u2019s a near impossible task for the kids of Raimon Junior High, since their team is lazy and out of shape, outside of their gung-ho captain Mark Evans -- but there\u2019s one bit of fortune that may turn everything around for them: a new student, with a mysterious soccer past, has recently transferred into the school.\r\nWhat  i like about this anime is how Endo mamoru overcomes hislove for football and his determination not to give up which his character development progresses as the series goes on reminds me of Naruto. and how People within the football team play football as a \"joke for fame and for glory\" However Endo mamoru says the statement  you should love football for who it is and that the main reason why you should play the game. and the way their end the anime cliffhangers is great it seems reasonable enough.\\n\\n\r\nThe part i dislike within the anime is how it lacks in communication with the characters  you will usually notice most character wont communicate with others but  keep most of their thoughts to themselves throughout the whole anime and i don't like the concept of that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the best part of this anime is how the story  progresses and thats pretty much it.",

            "content": "Story: \r\nI couldn't watch past the second episode of this Anime. The story has a major problem in the \u201cwilling suspense of disbelief\u201d department. The idea of the soccer players having super powers just didn't sit well with me as I was watching this. Now, I'm not saying you can't add the fantastical element of super powers to an Anime, but this Anime honestly took things too far. You're given a bunch of really cool \u201csuper power moves\u201d in the second episode and there is no build up to the idea. I also know that this is supposed to be a little kids show andI can see why it would appeal to the intended audience. However, I also dislike the idea of treating kids like they are simple minded and couldn't grasp a more complex series.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art in my opinion is horrible. When people read this part, they may very well think I am refering to the style that is used for this Anime. I actually have seen other Anime shows that share similar elements to Inazuma Eleven and I have to say they are better animated and far less jarring then what I saw here. It was almost as if the person who came up with the character designs really didn't try. There is no consistency in the style either and it is all over the place. There is nothing appealing about the art work except for the characters there is more focus on.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nInazuma Eleven's strong point is the sound and that isn't saying much. I absolutely love the opening line of the opening lyrics. And then there is nothing else that is memorable. Actually, I kind of wanted the umph for that opening line to run through the entire Anime, but it simply didn't.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are horrible. I know I've only watched two episodes and people will likely tell me it is to early to judge. The truth is though, the characters are really obnoxious Gary Stues. I felt like I was reading a bad fanfic for one of the better soccer Anime out there rather then a show that could stand on its own. I mean, its even got your pre-teen/teenager angst which is so annoying in fanfiction because it is just not at all realistic.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI did not enjoy this Anime at all. I might come back and give it a second chance later on, but the honest truth is I was rather disgusted with what I saw in this Anime's first two episodes. I'd rather go and pick up a different sports Anime because this really doesn't cut it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nI suggest not picking this up. The first two episodes were boring and had indicators that the show was overly repetitive.",

You don't have to be a soccer fan to like it (to tell the truth I really dislike soccer ...) or to have an understanding of it. \r\nThe story was, well, surprising. It is a bit unrealistic to use soccer for world domination or try to kill kids because of soccer but it is an anime - it doesn't have to be realistic. At first, I was really annoyed by seeing soccer-playing aliens (2nd arc) who destroyed Japanese high schools like they couldn't use their power for moreprofitable purposes. Of course this made no sense at all on the first glance, but in the end it was surprisingly well resolved. \\n\\n\r\nBesides the story is only secondary. Inazuma Eleven focuses on the characters, which are unique and well designed. There is a character development and even though there are a lot of characters the show managed to balance quantity and quality. Everyone has his own story and his own problems to overcome. I really loved this show because of its characters and would give it 20 out of 10 points if it would be possible.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I recently had the pleasure of watching Inazuma Eleven for a third time and I can safely say it is still as evergreen and exciting as I found it the first and the second time I watched it. \r\nPresented by Oriental Light & Magic, the studio that gave us Pokemon, Inazuma Eleven has been a huge success in Japan and several other countries and it has good reasons for so. \r\nThe story is centered around a young and energetic football freak, Endou Mamoru, who is trying to gather members for the local school football team; The Raimon Junior High. With his charismatic personality and never-givingup spirit, Endou with the help of a few soccer buddies manages to find eleven players to play for the club and to aim for the Football Frontier Tournament. Football Frontier is a competition where all the junior high schools across the nation participate in order to achieve the number one position in the whole country. But before they could even participate in the tournament, they are pit against the famous Teikoku Academy, which is currently the best in the nation and have been winning the tournament for 40 successive years. Things do not go as planned however for Raimon as they are completely overpowered by Teikoku in all departments of the game. Shoot after shoot, goals after goals Raimon players get battered brutally with an overwhelming margin of 20 goals to nil as Endou Mamoru could only watch his friends lying helplessly not able to stand across the field. As everything seems over before it began for Raimon, an unexpected twist occurs as Gouenji Shuuya, the talented striker who swept away all his opponents single-handedly in the previous Football Frontier Tournament while still just being a freshman, takes the field wearing a Raimon unifrom. It seems that Teikoku was waiting all along for him to take the field and as he does an inspired Endou Mamoru catches the ball cleanly hit by Teikoku and throws it straight at Gouenji who then with this amazing shoot makes the goal. Teikoku then abandon the game as they got what they had come for, and thus resulting in a victory for Raimon Junior High. This is the beginning of the adventures that await Raimon and Endou Mamoru in his future. \\n\\n\r\nThe are three different arcs in the show - The Football Frontier arc, The Aliea Academy arc and the Football Frontier International arc. \\n\\n\r\n(i) Football Frontier arc: Follows the journey of Raimon Junior High as they take on the local school teams to enter the competition and play against the best of the nation and their journey to the top.\\n\\n\r\n(ii) Aliea Academy arc: Follows quickly after the Football Frontier Final against Zeus Academy as various schools across the nations including Raimon Junior High is destroyed supposedly by \"Aliens\" who say to come from the far planet of Aliea as the messengers of Aliea Academy. They use a Soccer battle as the means to conquer the Earth. There are five teams in Aliea Academy; Gemini Storm, the second rank team that are the first to arrive. Epsilon (Also play as Epsilon Remastered in the later episodes), the first rank team and the rest are Diamond Dust, Prominence and Genesis which is led by Hiroto, are the three master rank teams.\\n\\n\r\n(iii) Football Frontier International arc: Begins after the victory of Raimon against the Aliea Academy's Genesis and players around the country are gathered to form the Inazuma Japan which is the national team of Japan. The arc follows their journey as they progress through the Asian preliminaries and face the teams from all over the world.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters play a pivotal role in the series as is the case in every anime, and each of them have their own unique personality and appeal. \\n\\n\r\nGouenji Shuuya: The cool-headed striker with great potential and also known as \"The Flame Striker.\"\\n\r\nEndou Mamoru: The Goalkeeper and the protagonist of the series. He is also the Captain of Raimon Junior High. \\n\r\nKidou Yuuto: The brains and the genius strategist of the field. He previously was the Captain of the Teikoku Academy but now is an irreplaceble addition to Raimon Junior High. \\n\\n\r\nThese are just the main three characters of the team and there is the rest of the team as well consisting of Kazemaru, Someoka, Handa, Max, Kabeyama, Shourin along with several other members that join Raimon in the future. \\n\\n\r\nEndou Daisuke is the grandfather and a former soccer player-cum-goalkeeper for the Japan National team and it is he whom Endou looks upon as an inspiration and decides to be a goalkeeper himself.\\n\\n\r\nKageyama Reiji is the main antagonist of the show. Kageyama's father was once hailed as the future of Japanese football and that is before when a group of exceptionally talented players gathered by Endou Daisuke overpower him and he is descended into darkness. This leaves a huge mark on a then young Kageyama as he grows deep hatred for soccer in his heart and vows to use any shrewd means possible to take his revenge and to sit on top of the soccer world. He is the owner of the Teikoku Academy and is mostly called as \"Commander\" by Kidou Yuuto and the rest of his players. It was him that taught Kidou his soccer and made him grow up to be a prodigy. However the sense of self-righteouness earned by playing against Endou and his friends, Kidou vows to leave Teikoku and follow the right path and to play his own soccer. It's pretty ironic actually that the villain whom you will hate for the most of the show then turns good later in the show in what was an absolutely heart-wrenching episode to say the least. I could not hold back my tears at that point and most likely you won't be as well. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound aspect of Inazuma Eleven is one of its strongest assets. The soundtracks used between the episodes are brilliant and it won't be an exaggeration for me to say that Inazuma Eleven has one of the best set of soundtracks in anime. Furthermore, it also boasts of six top-class openings performed by T-Pistonz + KMC. Two of my favorite top 5 anime openings are from the show. They're simply classic. The ending themes vary from person to person as they're all aimed differently for both boys and girls. The voice acting again in this anime is top-notch. A lot of budget was put into this and it clearly verifies it by the class of the voice actors. Each of them is a pro and and you're most likely to find them in any other anime you see. One of the main example is the voice of Endou, which is the same voice actor popular in his role for Naruto in the Naruto franchise. \\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is done well throughout the series and has a simple characteristic look aimed at the teens so nothing too special about them. The football while in a soccer match is done neatly and there is no use of CGI and everything is kept simple which is the best way. The \"Hissatsu Techniques\" as well are drawn beautifully and never under-achieves. \\n\\n\r\nInazuma Eleven is like a dose of childhood to me, I can keep watching this numerous times and it won't disappoint me in a slight way. If you're a football/soccer freak like me then this series is a must see, even if you're not then as well I'd recommend you to watch it. It's very exciting throughout and with the addition of the cool Hissatsu moves it only adds its reputation and for me it cements its position as  one of the best sport anime out there. \\n",

            "content": "Before \"Inazuma Eleven\" came along, I always thought \"Captain Tsubasa\" represented very well the football issue (\"football\" in UK, \"soccer\" in USA). It still does, altough it can be a bit boring sometimes (the first episodes of the 1983 version are unforgettable)\r\nBut in my opinion, so far, \"Inazuma Eleven\" is really the best, with \"Ganbare Kickers\" coming in second place. Sure there's a bit of exageration with those football moves when playing a game, but the football game moments are nice to see (nice sound and art as well)\r\nWhat's really the best is the story out of the football games combined with a great castof characters (when a character is included, the story only gets better): there's some great moments for comedy and drama in there\\n\\n\r\nJunko Takeuchi is always great when she voices the main character, Endou Mamoru. No wonder: she also showed that in \"Hunter x Hunter\" (Gon Freecs) and \"Naruto\" (Uzumaki Naruto)\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, a great anime and hoping for more suprises in it",

            "content": "In December of 2015, I decided to pick a bunch of non- seasonal anime that I wanted to watch alongside the Winter 16 anime season. One of these series was Inazuma Eleven.\r\nNow I went into this anime with very low expectations due to the fact that I don't like sports that much plus some of my least favourite sports are football, boxing volleyball and baseball. So I was expected to hate this anime because of it. As again I don't like sports that much and honestly I was expecting to kinda hate this anime. Was I wrong in my personal judgement or I am right?\r\nStory.\r\nThestory in Inazuma Eleven follows a cheerful goalkeeper captain named Endou Mamoru who is looking for members to join the Raimon Soccer Club. However due to Raimon Soccer Club only having 6 players the student body council president named Natsumi threatens the Raimon Soccer Club by disbandment if they wont win a game by Teikoku Gakuen as well getting enough players. When Raimon recruited enough players they faced off with Teikoku Gakuen however Raimon Soccer were competently outclassed. When all hope was lost at the very last second a striker named Gouenji helps the Raimon team to score a point using a powerful hissatsu technique called Fire Tornado. Shocked about the power Teikoku Gakuen forfeits the match where Raimon Soccer Club won by default. This gives Endou along with the Raimon Soccer members hope that they will one day win the Football Frontier. From there Endou along with the Raimon Soccer members would aimed to become the best soccer time like no other team ever was.\\n\r\nInazuma Eleven is split up into three main arcs as well as some subplots that take place during the main arcs.\\n\r\nFootball Frontier Arc (EP1-26)\\n\r\nAilea Academy Arc (EP27-EP65)\\n\r\nFootball Frontier International Arc (EP66-127 End)\\n\r\nHonestly, the story isn't the strongest part of Inazuma Eleven. I am going to be real honest it's one of its weaker parts of the story especially in the earlier episodes of the first arc which I found to be cheesy at times but at the same time, I just can't help to really get invested by it.\\n\r\nThe first half it execution. In my opinion, you can make even the most boring sounding setups really good if you can get the execution just right and Inazuma Eleven just that. Honestly, I don't care if the sport is realistic or not because for I only care about the execution more than anything else\\n\r\nThe other half are the subplots and in my opinion, they are some best subplots I have ever seen in any anime. They are just really handled well, and they add life to the characters which prevent them from being boring and generic shounen characters.\\n\r\nAll of the arcs were all very enjoyable to watch and they well directed because each arc knows to use its content really well.\\n\r\nThe show explores the theme for friendship, teamwork, value as well as overcoming your fears and weaknesses and this show manages to execute them perfectly.\\n\r\nI really like the story for this one even though it\u2019s on the little basic side for the most part. I don't think much more was needed because the execution of it was so well handled specially in seasons 2 and 3 where the writers decided to go all out.\\n\r\nGreat job director Katsuhito Akiyama.\\n\r\n8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\r\nThe characters are what really brings this show together because like with the story it is the execution was great.\\n\r\nFirst, we have Endou Mamoru who is our main captain for the Raimon and later on Inazuma Japan as well as being the main goalkeeper for the team.\\n\r\nEndou starts off as a goofy and kinda hot-headed protestant who has a passion for football but honestly as the series progresses he developed from a less goofy hot-headed main protagonist to a very determined and more responsible captain for the team. I actually adore this character because he is a well-developed character and a lovable one.\\n\r\nI was really impressed with Endou as a who and that's why I adore him and he's one of my favourite\u2019s characters in the show, to be honest.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNext up we have our main striker for Raimon Gouenji Shuuya\\n\r\nNow like Endou he has a strong passion for football but unlike Endou, he's much calmer but self-centred but as the series progresses he much friendly to the team as having massive character development. Not to mention his subplot and backstory was just great and well told.\\n\r\nOverall Gouenji is a great character on he\u2019s own right.\\n\r\nLastly, we have Kidou Yuuto who is the brains and strategist player for Raimon who is formerly the Captain of the Teikoku Academy but now is an irreplaceable addition to Raimon Junior High. I can only say this much to this character because he is a walking spoiler character which he's side plot. Besides the one that I just mentioned because it happens early on the story anyway.\\n\r\nAll I can say about Kidou is he is an amazing character and he is one of the few complex characters.\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters are hit or mess depending on your tastes.\\n\r\nFor me, most of the characters were great because they had they own subplots which are well written for the most part and they fun to watch as well as being well developed. Sure there were a few miss characters but least they didn't damage the show for me.\\n\r\nThen we have what is easily my favourite characters in Inazuma Eleven. Kazemaru Ichirouta.\\n\r\nI honestly have grown attached with this because I just really liked how his very friendly as well as being competitive player not to mention I really adore his character design.\\n\r\nIn my opinion, Kazemaru is probably the most realistic character in this show personality wise.\\n\r\nOverall the characters were awesome.\\n\r\n9.5/10\\n\r\nVisuals.\\n\r\nVisually Inazuma Eleven is pretty good.\\n\r\nThe art of Inazuma Eleven is fresh and surprised greatly because I like the character designs for the most because they feel fresh and original.\\n\r\nOne thing that I liked that is the use of colour for each arc representing the mood and the tone of each arc.\\n\r\nThe football frontier arc has bright colour feel it to it but not full colourful while the Aliea Academy arc has a more depressing feel to it. Then we have the football frontier arc international arc which has more modern sports anime feel to it because of the colour usage and the art, in general, has greatly improved in terms of quality.\\n\r\nThe animation was surprising really good, and it stays consistent all the thought and when they players use hissatsu techniques its freaking amazing of how well animated they all are. Sure at times can use re-use the hissatsu animation but for a show like this, I didn't really bother me too much because they are amazingly animated.\\n\r\nAlso the character designs, for the most part, were great and unique.\\n\r\nSure there were a few questionable ones, but they didn't really bother me too much.\\n\r\nThis is by definitely Oriental Light and Magic finest work in terms of art and animation especially in season 3 (Football Frontier International Arc) where it looks absolutely beautiful at times putting some of the recent anime to shame at times.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the visuals were great.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nThe first time that I listened to the OST I personally found it lacklustre but over time I started getting used to it and I ended up completely loving the OST because how amazing it was.\\n\r\nHell, some of the tracks in Inazuma Eleven are emotional and just plain epic.\\n\r\nNotable tracks include.\\n\r\nTeikoku Gakuen Theme Empire Gakuen came!\\n\r\nMortal combat with the empire Gakuen\\n\r\nLethal Attack\\n\r\nGathering Circle\\n\r\nKanashii Kano\\n\r\nAll of the Opening and Endings themes are amazing. \\n\r\nMy favourite openings and endings in Inazuma Eleven are opening four and ending 1 because they fit very well with each other like the opening 4 adds hype for that arc while ending 1 closes that arc perfectly.\\n\r\nThe Japanese audio for the series was great, and the voice actors were well acted.\\n\r\nNotable Seiyuu performance goes to Junko Takeuchi as Endou Mamarou, Hiroyuki Yoshino as Kidou Yuuto, Sanae Kobayashi as Natsumi Raimon, Rie Kugimiya aka (Tsundere Queen) as Toramaru Utsunomiya, Yuki Kaji as Kazuya Ichinose and Nishigaki, Yuka as Kazemaru Ichirouta.\\n\r\nThere's also an English dub. Please don't watch the English dub it's really bad. I watch the dub for this on Nintendo's anime channel just to see how it is and it was just awful. Not only the voices were bad but the audio quality itself is bad plus the story and characters development were butchered to all hell.\\n\r\nAll of the characters have different names, and they were really bad on that and the final nail of the coffin for this dub is the show cuts off after season 2 leaving you with an uncompleted story.\\n\r\nI only watched the first 2 episodes for the dub for this I dropped it half way in the episode because the voices were just so freaking horrible to listen plus the voice actors had no emotion with the roles whatsoever.\\n\r\nSo there really no reason to watch Inazuma Eleven dubbed, and I won't take any points away because it's honestly hard to find an Inazuma Eleven dub nowadays let alone good quality.\\n\r\nOverall besides what I said about the dub the I really love the OST, Openings, Endings and voice acting for the original Japanese audio\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts.\\n\\n\r\nInazuma Eleven might just be the anime that I realize I judged this too early.\\n\r\nAm being really honest when I say that my opinions for this anime went from basically is just another mediocre sports anime to oh my god l freaking this anime so much!!!\\n\r\nSeriously this went being something that I will hate to something that I will love, and it impressed me in so many ways that I will never think possible with a sports anime let alone a kid\u2019s anime.\\n\r\nThis is just an awesome anime that I barely speak my praises enough. The story, the characters, the animation the OST, the openings the endings and the voice acting were all just great. I know it could easily have flopped, but execution for everything is so great.\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a great sports anime that is entertaining and has a strong character cast I recommend Inazuma Eleven. It was a great series that I will forever love until the end of time\\n\r\nFinal Score 9/10\\n",

            "content": "Inazuma Eleven is what you would expect from a kids' sport Anime. Full of sparks and over-the-top flashy moves, but little to none substance or story depth. I'm totally not against the characters having super powers, but when this overused feature starts damaging the actually good on-going action, it doesn't work for me. The characters can apparently freeze time or increase the length of the soccer/football field so they can do one of their signature techniques (which makes no sense by the way, it just alter how strong the shoot will be, apart from some few dribble moves). I was also bothered by the repetitiveformula that the anime kept after the first arc. After awhile, the final scores of the matches became futile as we all knew our heroes would emerge triumphant. I found myself urging for something unexpected to happen, but everything was just painfully predictable. \\n\\n\r\nThe Anime, however, kept me insterested into it because of how amusingly absurd it was. I also enjoy this touring around style, so I got that going for me.",

            "content": "This anim\u00e8 is one of the most annoying i have ever seen. It starts of like all other shounen series, but maybe the first one i have seen where the main character still have both his parents. Its about Endou Mamoru, a goalkeeper for a pathetic football team threatened to shut down if they can't get enought members and beat the best youth team in Japan. And that's how it starts, and escalades into one of the most dreadful manuscripts ever. \r\nThe story is not bad because of lack of characters or the lack of plot. But the story itself is just utterly unrealistic. Itsnot about the football in or of itself, but more of the evil people plotting terrifying plans behind the courtain. The plot really pisses me of, and i can guarantee you, if you are not a 9 year old boy. You will get annoyed. \\n\r\nSometimes you would rather tear out your eyeballs and feed them to pigs than to watch particular segments of the episode.\\n\\n\r\nIm not gonna give you any spoilers, but this series is farther away from perfect than Pluto is from the Sun.\\n\\n\r\nBut that is why i love it. I don't take it seriously at all. Ok, ill admit it. I always cheer for Endou and Inazuma Eleven/Inazuma Japan, even though i KNOW they are going to win. But i don't take the manuscript seriously at all. It's brilliant, watching evil people plotting to KILL children because of a youth club football match. It's so unrealistic that i cannot  describe how annoyed this series get me, and i kinda like that feeling to. I want to jump into the screen and knock some sense into them. But this isn't what fuels my \"need\" for this series. It has heart and soul, it got all the right messages morally. Even though you sometimes think the characters are abit one-dimensional. \\n\\n\r\nI don't even think the writers take themselves seriously. I think they blurt out ideas, laught at it, and make it fit. From one moment you are on a football field, the other, on a crime scene. Under pressure by a all powerfull leader that wants to take over the world. \\n\\n\r\nBy using kids... on a football field.... \\n\\n\r\nYou take my point?\\n\\n\r\nTo sum it up.\\n\r\nSTORY-2- As you already have figured out, the story is dreadful. \\n\\n\r\nART-9- I have no complaints about the artwork, some of it are pretty cool. The different \"Hissatsu techniques\" are pretty cool-looking, and good animation overall i must say. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND-8- My main focus when i watch anime is story and how much i enjoy it. But it's all relative, and you can't enjoy an anime without good sound, and i think they did a decent job here. I personally can't put my finger on any major flaws.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER-8- Shounen, everything from evil cocky guyes, to overtrusting guys who relies on their friends, and would die for them. Etc\\n\r\nBut it works on all other shows, so i see no reason why it shouldnt work here\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT-9-I have already explained why i enjoy this, i can disconnect my brain and just watch this, laught at the stupid plot.I give it a 9, because some scenes make me want to crush my computer in anger. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Inazuma Eleven is my greatest accomplishment in anime with its 127 episodes. I can\u2019t remember why I started it, but here I am, 127 episodes after. Yes, 127. That\u2019s one point you must consider before starting this anime.\r\nLet\u2019s begin with the plot. To summarize everything, some aliens came from outer space to destroy everything on Earth with a soccer ball. The team \u2014 that we are following \u2014 must stop them from doing so by winning a soccer tournament against them. You must be thinking it\u2019s funny. You\u2019re right, it is.\r\nMost episodes are soccer matches but sometimes there are some extra spices where they developcharacters, and in so many episodes, they have enough time to do so for everyone in the team. But characters are generic and it isn\u2019t that worth following them. A great example is the leader who can\u2019t stop believing in friendship\u2026 Dear God, how many sh\u014dnen have that annoying character? Of course, thanks to him, while they are always losing in the first half of their matches, they understand the power of the heart in the second half and win\u2026\\n\\n\r\nOne good point in Inazuma Eleven is that you can watch it even if you don\u2019t like soccer. After all, this anime is unrealistic so this is mostly based on production values to be entertaining. There are good voice actors, soundtrack has also some entertaining themes (though there aren\u2019t enough for its length). Animation is fluid, special techniques used in soccer have also great visual effects, no doubt about it.\\n\\n\r\nThen, if you ask me if I liked this anime, I can barely answer. On one hand, the plot isn\u2019t moving on and is terribly repetitive, on the other hand, production values managed to keep me watching this series through the end.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: Inazuma Eleven is an average anime; it is kids-oriented but not like a fairy tale or an original movie from Ghibli that we can still enjoy without being a kid anymore. You are now aware, it is not meant for people seeking for quality. Most kids kill some time watching shows on TV, I\u2019d say Inazuma Eleven is one they should avoid to play real soccer instead.",

The OPs have the soccer anthem feel while the EDs give you anice sweet feeling. Voice acting is great as the voices suit the characters.\\n\\n\r\nStory is nice in your typical road to success way though they incorporate many fantasy-products (see gods, aliens, angels and demons etc.) but never the less is decent\\n\\n\r\nCharcters... now you are talking, surprisingly over the top yet lovable characters, they are the main thing of the story.

I have to admit that the result is not bad, although it is the umpteenth cores taken from a popular topic such as football. This time, however, we are not faced with mileage fields \"hill\" Holly e Benji or games that last bet on betting. Must be pointed out that the setting and the way in which the small players Raimon and the other teams are moving quite reminiscent of those of the movie Shaolin Soccer, with shots that become necessary secrets and balls of fire, ice, penguins with appear from theground to accompany the dynamics of the shot. The power ups then frame the various episodes in which the boys will perform new techniques with the result of workouts to the limits of the human. They will sacrifice and the will to never give up to lead the team to victory\\n\\n\r\nThe story is well woven, starring a guy who dreams of winning the Football Frontier together with his team, Raimon fact. The difficulty, as expected, will soon fail, but thanks to the team spirit and the desire to always fight, Mark, the main character is going to make the situation more desperate.\\n\r\nFootball is here seen as a fun vehicle to make new friends and make connections. In fact, during the fighting the bad guys on duty will receive a severe lesson learning the true meaning of the word football.",

            "content": "This is the first anime that I ever watched online. I was in love with the anime on tv, and unfortunately it only aired early in the morning at 6 am, so I set my alarm clock extremely early every time just to watch it. Unfortunately the dub version wasn't that far in my country, and I had to watch the rest of the show online. Glad I did.\r\nThe first thing I want to say is that I'd rate the sound of Inazuma Eleven the highest of all. In fact, out of all animes that I have watched so far, there was no anime Iwould rate the sound of as high as in this show. It used the opening and outro theme songs in the middle of episodes itself as well, which can make me love an anime over 9000 times more. The soundtracks were perfectly fitting with the scenes, and also beautifully orchestrated. I sometimes still listen to some of the soundtracks on youtube, or sing hum them out loud. The opening songs are all enjoyable as well.\\n\\n\r\nNext up is the story, which I don't rate that high. Some things are unrealistic, or found way too far, as if the makers had to come up with something, no matter how realistic, to make something else that's cool possible. And the whole second season doesn't make a lot of sense, but no spoilers on that. The difficulty scaling could be better too. Apart from that there are some touching scenes, characters have good background stories and their own strong personalities, and the connections between characters are strong as well. The art-style isn't outstanding, but pleasing to the eye and enjoyable, and every character is unique, a.k.a. every person has their own unique appearance and amazing hairstyle.\\n\\n\r\nI highly advice you to watch Inazuma Eleven. You can feel the tension on the soccer field. The amazing supernatural techniques can be so awesome, ranging from fire tornadoes to ghost hands, that you want to repeat them on the field in real life. When the main characters score a goal, you just want to cheer together with the crowd, and you feel bad for them as well when they loose. Simply one of the most enjoyable animes I've ever watched.",

            "content": "I randomly stumbled upon this anime, by finding an amazing OST from it. So I decided to look up the anime itself. At first I was a bit sceptical about 127 episodes. But when I got past the first 3 episodes it began to get interesting. The show introduces tons of characters, whereas you will see some re-appear again, and some will get tons of spotlight. Around 50% of the characters will get an in-depth background story, which allows the characters to develop even further. \r\nThe main thing in the anime is soccer, at first I thought it would be plain ball kicking, but thenthey added \"abilities/skills\" to the ball kicking. It really caught my interest, that there were 200+ different abilities the show had to offer. It led to a big variety, which certainly keeps the show interesting. And the animation on those abilities were just fantastic. I was like O_O at them all.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is really good, although it may get \"boring\" on the long term, due to some parts being really predictable. But every single Arc in Inazuma eleven was fantastic. I especially love the way different soccer teams were introduced, and their main \"theme\" by that I mean Jungle team, horror team and much more.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is fantastic, and it really spices the show up, whilst also adding tons of atmosphere for the X situation in the anime. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I really enjoyed this anime, and can definitely recommend it.\\n\\n",

But as it happens I came across this anime while watching TVTokyo at 4 in the morning waiting for Bleach to come on. At first I thought it was ridiculous but it really got me hooked. This series is not like any soccer anime you might have seen before. It is over the top, most the characters develop super powers (but only when they play soccer), and often times they just throw the actual rules of soccer out the window. Butthat's what makes the show, its just over the top fun. If you are in between watching animes and just want something lighthearted to watch, then this is probably the show for you. The series follows a story but for the most part each episode has it's own plot so you can pick up the series whenever and still understand whats going on. Personally I just pick it up in between more heavy shows just to pick my mood up.\\n\r\n     This is a recommend for everyone. Ya, it's a little kiddy but who really cares. If you like a show that takes something normal and blows it completely out of proportion then you will probably like this show. Just go turn it on, I promise you won't regret it.",

            "content": "So there's a whole lot of animes that present about sports, mainly Football or Soccer (Well, they're both the same though), since the 19th century. And as far as i know, there are, (The rather famous) Captain Tsubasa, which has been done in many remakes (Particularly in graphics), Hungry Heart, and Shoot!. Well, that's all i know so far, actually. And now, which i want to review it to you, there's the Inazuma Eleven (Inazuma11 for short), which in my way of point, is rather odd.\r\nStory (3/10)\r\nI don't know where to start, exactly. Because this is... well, what it is actually, is one of thesection where i didn't like about the anime. What sicks me out actually, is it's a junior football game, where most bad guys, is soo obsessed in \"Killing\" the good guys. I'm sorry, but it's a football game! In my childhood, me and my friends is maniacally in love with Captain Tsubasa, because it's SIMPLY cool, and nothing extraordinary... despite the shooting effects, of course. Then there's this....\"Powers\", where it didn't explain itself of \"How the hell did he do that!?\". For example; there's this kid who can make Kagebunshin (or if you're not a Naruto fan, it's something like self-cloning/multiplying... thing) to overtake a single person to take the ball from him. And there's this keeper, who can \"Summon\" thousands of aura-hands to capture a single shot. Well i'm sorry, but i'm TOTALLY prefer to watch Shaolin Soccer rather than something trying to be like one, who is not even close to, even if it's an anime.\\n\\n\r\nSorry for not mentioning the REAL story review, because other than being a spoiler, it's just a standard kids show: Reaching to the top, or like Being a No.1.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nNot to underestimate the Art & Animation, though. For a kids show, it's very top notch. Everything is so smooth and clean. And they take the camera angles very nicely. Although, some fillers take the roll repeatedly in some episodes, which will makes you think something new isn't coming. Fortunately, this rarely happens.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nWell, it's the same as the Art & Animation does, good qualities is in it's package.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (6/10)\\n\\n\r\nBasically, this is a child's anime....sort of. So it's obvious that the character designs is to be made for kids to like, which in our current age, is of course, rather weird. And of course, most of their attitudes is mainly focuses on \"NEVER GIVE UP!\", which is fine by me, since it's of course, good for children development.\\n\\n\r\nAnd as i said earlier, the antagonist is pretty sarcastic, or rather sadistic for a junior football game. Which is pretty annoying..\\n\\n\r\nSo that's the Character, and now we're moving on.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (4/10)\\n\\n\r\nHow do i put this? It's ridiculous on it's story and the characters, but at the same time i kinda like the idea and the concept of the overall anime, which is something the anime didn't make it to what they're after. Well, i assume kids will like it though, but just imagine if they watch this, and they get obsessed with playing soccer, they're definitely going to ask their parents, \"Dad, why can't i summon my clones?\". Why? Because like i said, the anime didn't explain itself about how those powers work, and technically, it's totally magical. If kids watch Captain Tsubasa, they'll find it out eventually how things work, like how Tsubasa could use the Drive Shoot, it explain itself how the technique works, 'cuz the theory is real (although some elements in C. Tsubasa taking it too much thx to the effects).\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall (6/10)\\n\\n\r\nSo overall, it's not so good, but it has it's own unique concept of how football game can be.... on the other world. But truthfully, kids will like this. But always remind them: It's not going to happen.",

            "content": "I don't have any interest in soccer, neither having a reason to watch a kiddy anime while I'm, in fact, 17 years old, especially I like the dark, action theme animes instead of sport and light-hearted shows. My first meeting with IE was when someone used Fubuki Fanart as signature and it looked really beautiful ( I was deceived lol). My first thought was \"WTF is this, so ridiculous\" when watching IE GO. And yet, I was hooked by it, watched the whole IE GO series, and then watched IE. I would say, I love IE more than its sequel.\r\nI didn't expect a sport serieshas a plot beside \"Lettttt's playyyyy gamesssss\", and yet, IE proved me wrong in many, many ways, especially the alien Arc, and I was like whatttt. Surprisingly, the arc ended up pretty well with the most reasonable solution that we can get and with all the character developments. The plot is never boring, in fact, you couldn't get bored because of how likable the characters are, how fun the hissatsu are to look at, and how the matchs are not really predictable. I couldn't guess whether the Raimon would win or lose in the Alien Arc, and maybe Raimon actually lost more than won in that arc. However, I think the reason that makes the plot successful is the pacing. The longest match would only be 3 and half episodes, and there would never be a moment that looked like the match just stops for characters to monologue. That is also the factor that makes some sport animes look like they're buying time (Kuroko no Basuke, Yowamuda Pedal, Diamond no Ace...). And yet, in fact, they actually said in the interview that they were buying time by throwing a random match in, but we would never realize (LOL). I also like the fact that the series doesn't treat us like kids, they already say \"it's a super-dimensional soccer, and this's how IE world works, deal with it.\" That's why, even though it's ridiculous, we can accept it, while some serious animes out there, trying to look as realistic as possible, but end up having unrealistic powers (KnB - no, I don't hate it, I have the whole mangas, but it's the best example) and stupid reasons and twists that comes out of thin air (Gunslinger Strator, Valvrave...). IE doesn't treat itself serious, and that's why we can easily accept it later instead of the annoying feeling hanging in our throats. The balance between goody and sad moments is also perfect, it never gets really bitter and makes us hard to swallow, while keeping the depth in characters' personalities.\\n\\n\r\nThe most thing I like about the series is the characters, and I can feel a strong connection to somes like Fubuki, Kazemaru, and maybe Hiroto, and sometimes I would just wish I have a friend like Endou, he is like a sunshine to everyone. In a show that have so many characters, you wouldn't expect all of them will have backstories, and yet, in IE, all of them would always have one or at least time to shine, although the story would only focus on certain one, like Fubuki and Hiroto in Alien Arc...This wonderful character developments is thank to the amount of episodes, because it's more effective when it takes long time for them to surpass their fears, like in reality. We can't easily change in such 1 or 2 episodes, like most short-term animes love to portray. Fubuki did take nearly 40 episodes to finally change, and his struggle takes like 10 episodes, continuously trembled and couldn't face soccer direcly. However, the director did a perfect job in expressing his deep fear, and we would never yell at Fubuki \"Godarnit get over it already.\" I was sincerely hoping he would get over his fear somedays soon, and when he finally did, I was really happy, and decided to change myself like him. Also, the character's design are really cool, even though it gets overboard sometimes lol, but at least we can easily recognize who with who.\\n\\n\r\nMusic is also a strong part of the series, and I would say the music director did a really great job in inserting the OP and ED in the matchs. Many times, the music make me feel goose bump during the match, when it's not actually that exciting. As expect of one that did the music for many series! The OST are just fun to listen to, and there are some piano songs that really nostagic whenever they're played in sad parts. \\n\\n\r\nThe weakness of the series would be its animation, but it never gets really bad as some A-1's shows, so it's okay.\\n",

            "content": "Inazuma Eleven tells the story of a ragtag group of junior highers on the verge of having their club disbanded -- unless they win an impromptu match against the school that holds a 40 year championship reign. It\u2019s a near impossible task for the kids of Raimon Junior High, since their team is lazy and out of shape, outside of their gung-ho captain Mark Evans -- but there\u2019s one bit of fortune that may turn everything around for them: a new student, with a mysterious soccer past, has recently transferred into the school.\r\nWhat  i like about this anime is how Endo mamoru overcomes hislove for football and his determination not to give up which his character development progresses as the series goes on reminds me of Naruto. and how People within the football team play football as a \"joke for fame and for glory\" However Endo mamoru says the statement  you should love football for who it is and that the main reason why you should play the game. and the way their end the anime cliffhangers is great it seems reasonable enough.\\n\\n\r\nThe part i dislike within the anime is how it lacks in communication with the characters  you will usually notice most character wont communicate with others but  keep most of their thoughts to themselves throughout the whole anime and i don't like the concept of that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the best part of this anime is how the story  progresses and thats pretty much it.",

            "content": "Story: \r\nI couldn't watch past the second episode of this Anime. The story has a major problem in the \u201cwilling suspense of disbelief\u201d department. The idea of the soccer players having super powers just didn't sit well with me as I was watching this. Now, I'm not saying you can't add the fantastical element of super powers to an Anime, but this Anime honestly took things too far. You're given a bunch of really cool \u201csuper power moves\u201d in the second episode and there is no build up to the idea. I also know that this is supposed to be a little kids show andI can see why it would appeal to the intended audience. However, I also dislike the idea of treating kids like they are simple minded and couldn't grasp a more complex series.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art in my opinion is horrible. When people read this part, they may very well think I am refering to the style that is used for this Anime. I actually have seen other Anime shows that share similar elements to Inazuma Eleven and I have to say they are better animated and far less jarring then what I saw here. It was almost as if the person who came up with the character designs really didn't try. There is no consistency in the style either and it is all over the place. There is nothing appealing about the art work except for the characters there is more focus on.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nInazuma Eleven's strong point is the sound and that isn't saying much. I absolutely love the opening line of the opening lyrics. And then there is nothing else that is memorable. Actually, I kind of wanted the umph for that opening line to run through the entire Anime, but it simply didn't.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are horrible. I know I've only watched two episodes and people will likely tell me it is to early to judge. The truth is though, the characters are really obnoxious Gary Stues. I felt like I was reading a bad fanfic for one of the better soccer Anime out there rather then a show that could stand on its own. I mean, its even got your pre-teen/teenager angst which is so annoying in fanfiction because it is just not at all realistic.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI did not enjoy this Anime at all. I might come back and give it a second chance later on, but the honest truth is I was rather disgusted with what I saw in this Anime's first two episodes. I'd rather go and pick up a different sports Anime because this really doesn't cut it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nI suggest not picking this up. The first two episodes were boring and had indicators that the show was overly repetitive.",

I say to watch it it's my favorite anime and If you like shonen/digimon/sport animes watch it! I thought the football frontier was interesting seeing other countries compete. I learned many things about soccer and makes me play it. Shows you practice and hard working is part of life. It felt like I was watching a soccer soap opera. If you love energetic/serious/adorable guys it's foryou. The girls weren't annoying like in most animes they helped and tried their best for the team. The music is amazing and I suggest you listen to ryuusei boy or the 7th ending. All openings are great too. I love the characters' names and voices. The only thing I don't like is the english dub they made two guys into girls and changed all their names. Watch the movie and the second season go! The movie was really good and the second season reminds you of this season they're planning to have a second movie :) This really made me cry all the drama and I love the cute episode when they're in tuxes. Let me admit this all the guys are sweet and work hard most of these guys are hotties I mean this is a kids show but It's just that awesome. It has a manga and video games too. So If you haven't seen you better watch it! :D",

It's all about  soccer, soccer and soccer, and of course there's friendship too (honestly, compared to the real world, their soccer love is either too extreme or too exaggerated...) but the story's nice. The characters are good. The power and and the actions there. I lovethe team work and I definitely envy their acrobatic skills and combo moves.\\n",

Also some views might find it a bit repetitive and predictable at times i would say that it's more for the under 13's but in saying that am at that age group and am enjoying it just fine (although in saying that there are also parts i wouldn't show my 6 year old cousin).\\n\\n\r\n-ART- \\n\r\nThe art is a little chibi and it is also very bold; but when your watching it i don't think your take much notice mainly because i think it's a pretty good anime to watch when you need a laugh, even so i can't really down it and i can't really stand up for it; either way for the style they chose they did a pretty good job.\\n\\n\r\n-SOUND-\\n\r\nNow i watched the first 25 or so in dub (which was not easy to find by the way)  and so am basing my score on that; i liked it - i know that a lot of people hate that dub more then most but if you listen to the voice then i think they did a pretty good job, the acting on the other hand wasn't so good and need to work on controlling how they make the emotions sound. The music made the climax's and i really did enjoy all the opening's and endings i've seen so far\\n\\n\r\n-CHARACTER- \\n\r\nI really liked the show's characters; it was full of strung, kind people how put everything they have into everything they do, i like the fact that they all lean of off each other at the same time as being leaned on.\\n\r\nAm not a great fan of the sport but on of the best lines in the anime was \" the goals was score are scored by all of us\".\\n\\n\r\n-ENJOYMENT-\\n\r\nEven if you won't like the art work or storyline you can still get enjoyment out of this anime; thats probably why i like it so much; you can hate the sport but the anime will still back you feel (even if it is a little childish), the little nag that i have (and it's probably the only one) is that in the english and japanese and english the names are different - it may not seem like a big deal but i still don't like it.\\n\\n\r\nSorry am gonna have to cut it short with that, am not feeling well and need some sleep- anyway i hope you watch this anime and enjoy it; but do try and keep am open mind coz if you start watching something thinking it will be bad thats all your say; it's not very big but this anime is special",

            "content": "Inazuma Eleven. \r\nAn anime about a bunch of kids playing soccer. That's the review.... Nah just kidding :p \r\nInazuma Eleven is an anime about soccer, about growing up, friendship, tough times and for some reason alot of tragedy, I will get back to this. \r\nHere we meet Endou Mamoru, a total soccer \"idiot\", who never gives up hope, no matter how far he is beat into the ground, the typical shounen hero, like Goku, Naruto etc. I won't give up! \r\nHe is a goalkeeper, so his name is almost kinda ironic, since Mamoru means protect, and well that's what a keeper does, he protects thegoal. \\n\\n\r\n-Story \\n\\n\r\nThe story is very simple and very average. It focuses on the team's ability to rise to the challenge against an enemy team. That's well mostly it. They get \"beaten\" by a team either in a game or mentally, then get stronger, win, get a new challenge. That's mostly it. Inazuma Eleven also has a knack for relying in my opinion, a tad too much on tragic background stories. \\n\\n\r\nEvery new player or the already current players, all seem to have either parents/grandparents/siblings who died in tragic accidents/sickness (Endou, Fubuki, Goenji) or have a hard time trusting people. This is for me kinda what brings down Inazuma alot. \\n\\n\r\nA tragic background story is a powerful tool in the right hands, but once it gets repetitive, it kinda loses most of it's meaning. It's originally used too make you get emotionally attached to a character, but this is hard when so many of the characters have this sort of background. \\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\\n\r\nThe art is also very mediocre. Inazuma eleven is flooded with re-use of same shots to save money, and I feel this show could have been so much better with more originality. Like a shoot is so cool when they make a new hissatsu, but you get kinda tired of seeing the same shot after some time, due to it looking the same all the time. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters though are in my opinion what brings the art a little up. I like the way it's drawn, and it makes the characters look cool and different from each other. \\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\\n\r\nI don't really have much to say about the sound, the soundtrack is ok, nothing that caught my attention, but neither something that distracted me from enjoying the show. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: \\n\\n\r\nAs said earlier in story, I feel the character growth in Inazuma Eleven is a little forced. It's like watching DBZ where Goku always grows, and the \"team\" is \"forced\" to always try and keep up with him. \\n\\n\r\nEndou has a knack for always being the one that is relied upon, even though this makes sense, him being the main character and all. He is voiced by Takeuchi Junko san, and I must say this is the best role i've heard her do. Yes, I mean it's better than her as Naruto. Deal with it (trolol)\\n\\n\r\nThough my favorite character probably is Fubuki. Hey, come on, they are playing with a guy with schizophrenia. His tragic background story, was in my opinion the best, and most understandable story in Inazuma Eleven. \\n\r\nThe way he kept fighting, feeling that the team themselves didn't want him but his \"alter ego\" Atsuya, or his brother if you prefer. \\n\\n\r\nSo there where some good character growth there, hence a 7. \\n\\n\r\n- Enjoyment\\n\\n\r\nWell, what can I say. I can say a lot of things about Inazuma Eleven that could have been better, could have been done differently and so on. But I can't really describe it, but I really enjoy Inazuma 11. \\n\\n\r\nSeeing that shot go in, breaking the keepers hissatsu after countless shots, and struggles just makes you cheer. And when they stop the opponent after failing again and again, you get psyched. \\n\\n\r\nAnd I feel that this series could have been an epic videogame, if properly funded. Like if they made Inazuma 11 with PES/Fifa dedication, and not make it sorta kids game. \\n\\n\r\n- Overall\\n\\n\r\nOverall it's mostly a show about having fun. It's average in all ways but the thrill you get from watching the games themselves. I might sound a little negative to the show, but this is for me a recommendation on the basis of you wanting a show just to keep you busy. It's fun and keeps you entertained, but if you are looking for that great anime, look elsewhere. \\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading my review, any notes are appreciated, both good and bad.",

            "content": "\"Let's play Sakka!\"\r\nI love Football (fav sport) I watched Captain Tsubasa before and i liked it but it wasn't as memorable as Inazuma Eleven. I was bored when I started watching it in Toonami. So let's start. \r\nStory:\r\nThe story centers into Endou Mamoru, the captain of Raimon Junior Soccer Team (Season 1 and 2) and Inazuma Japan (Season 3). I considered him a soccer freak. He really likes soccer. The first season is all about competing in a tournament against schools. But then it gets oddly in the 2nd season because they will fight ALIENS yeah Aliens. Season 3 is my fav its all aboutFFI (or I mean FIFA World Cup U-16). 3rd season all so has..... ANGELS AND DEMONS! But its really a good story so I give it 9.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI am not really a fan of IE's art. Its too much childlish for me. But the animations for the Hissatsu techniques is amazing. 7\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nMy opinions is mixed. But my fav op is Katte Nakou ze for its funky beat. 7\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: \\n\r\nThis where IE shines. Many characters has their backstories. The character development here is amazing. All characters of IE has there own dynamic personality which helps the story to be better. 9\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI really enjoyed IE because I am also a football player. It persuade me to play soccer again. 9\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIE is all about fantasy soccer with dragons, ice, angel, demons, and ridiculously bishounen aliens but with a amazing heartwarming story with a amazing end. 8",

Because TV was showing only 26 episodes i continued it on PC.\r\nStory : 9 - Like most sports anime , IE is not an exception. It starts from team who doesn't have very skilled players and concentrates on their journey to the top of the world. \r\nAlso the 'Arcs' are great - From Region cup to World Cup.\r\nHissatsu techniques made the sport even more interesting.\r\nArt : 8  - I Started liking character designs onlyfrom part when 'Aliea academy' showed up. Great thing about art is hissatsu techniques. They are colorful , enjoyable , I wanted to see even more & more new techniques. \\n\r\nArt for openings was..OK.\\n\\n\r\nSound : 5 - That's what i didn't like so much. Voice of main opening maker didn't get to me , but they fit to the main theme of anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 6  Because this is sports show , here whole story concentrates on football. There was some side stories or past stories of characters , but they are not very needed there. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 9 - I can say , i really enjoyed watching those football matches. The more it progressed - the stronger opponents they faced.The stronger opponents they faced - the stronger and more fantastic hissatsu techniques we were able to see ! :)\\n\\n\r\nSorry for mistakes.",

            "content": "Though many people may turn this anime down because it is centered around soccer and is incredibly long, if you like positive shows with many 1980s-esque story elements and/or magical boys and girls fighting against aliens, this is certainly not an anime to be missed. \r\n____________________\r\n-\"Football Frontier\" arc (Episode 1-26)\r\nIn this world of super-powered-magical-boy-soccer, the story begins following a cheeky little middle school boy named Endou Mamoru, whose late grandfather left behind a legacy in the soccer playing world around 40 years ago. Mamoru starts up a soccer club at his middle school, but the members are never inspired enough to get any practice andhave nowhere on school grounds to do so. The daughter of the school chairman arranges for the soccer club to recruit more members and participate in a soccer match against the super strong Teikoku Academy, or be disbanded. The rest of the season follows the team trying to become stronger to enter in Japan's middle school soccer tournament, the Football Frontier.\\n\\n\r\nThe story after the first four or five episodes started to feel weak and repetitive,  but around the twelfth episode or so quickly regained its pacing. Plot is very generic for the sports anime genre, but is kept interesting by the wide variety of characters and their magical soccer attacks. The art, while still very nice and fluid compared to a lot of other children's anime, falls short in quality compared to the animation in the second and third story arcs, and the colours used felt very washed out. Character designs for several supporting characters felt somewhat dull (like the designs for Kino Aki and Handa Shinichi) but the main three characters as well as a lot of the episodic characters had very nice designs. Sound quality and voice acting are very good and very well done, and good character development occurs in a decent portion of the main team's characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 6/10\\n\r\n____________________\\n\\n\r\n-\"Aliea Academy\" arc (Episode 27-67)\\n\\n\r\nImmediately following the events of the first season, Mamoru and his team return to their city to find their school in ruins. They are encountered by jumpsuit-clad beings who claim to be messengers from a distant planet called \"Aliea\". These beings announce that they have decided to take over Earth by displaying their power to humans through soccer. The main characters set off to recruit the strongest players in Japan to take down the aliens and find out what their true motive is.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is a little hard to comprehend the first time in, as now the magical soccer boys are playing soccer against weird aliens, but the general story flow is very well done, and though a few things are left unexplained by the end, the story is very interesting at the least. The animation improves fairly noticeably, still very fluid and actually improving areas that were fairly rough in the first season. Colours still feel somewhat dry (even more so than the first season) for a 2008-2009 anime, making it feel as if it were a late '90s anime instead. New character designs are very well done, especially the designs for a lot of the aliens. Each of the new (more prominent) characters get a particularly good amount of development, particularly Fubuki Shirou, Tachimukai Yuuki, and Gran/Kiyama Hiroto. Sound quality remains unchanged and is still very well maintained.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 9/10\\n\r\n____________________\\n\\n\r\n-\"Football Frontier International\" arc (Episode 68-127)\\n\\n\r\nJapan's strongest players from the last season are called back to the main character's hometown to participate in a selection match to become Japan's representatives for the international Football Frontier tournament. They have to fight through the Asian team preliminaries to claim their ticket to fight against the rest of the world and aim for the top.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall plot is fairly simplistic and nothing special for a sports anime, much like season one, but there are many interesting sub plots and great character development over the course of the season. The season did feel like it was dragging on a little too long, and had a few filler episodes that were pretty useless and could've been done without. Art is widely improved over the last two seasons, with more vivid colours, and even nicer animation. There are even more new characters including tons from around the world, such as characters from Australia, Brazil, England, and the U.S. The international characters did not get very much development (for example Edgar Valtinas and Mark Kruger felt incredibly flat and uninteresting, and although they had good potential they were ultimately cast aside by creators and fans in favour of the the ironically dull and generic semi-protagonist Fideo Aldena), but other new characters such as Tobitaka Seiya and Mac Roneejo are very interesting and wonderful additions to the cast. Sound quality feels even clearer than the first two seasons.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 7/10\\n\r\n____________________\\n\\n\r\nOver the course of the series, many positive and encouraging morals are displayed, and the general cheery feel of the anime is a good mood lifter, but there are several sad and bittersweet moments throughout the entire series as well. It's a very thoughtful and well balanced series, and though it may not be the greatest anime ever (as yes, it's still a children's sports anime based off a video game), it's worth watching in the end.",

            "content": "I picked up this show because I wanted something that wasn't too heavy, and was enjoyable and lighthearted. And that's exactly what this was. Though silly at times, the essence of this show is something that was created purely for the enjoyment of children. This show achieved just that. A plot that was easy to follow, lovable characters with distinct personalities, and super-cool and flashy powers. Too often I see shows that fail at doing these things and end up being trashy, but Inazuma Eleven manages to capture this spirit perfectly. \r\nThe fact that this show was sponsored by two large companies, P&G and McDonalds,ensured that there was no lack of budget. This means that the art and animation were flawless. I can't tell you how many times I've rewinded and replayed 3-second intervals of scenes just to see how beautiful the animation is. The same goes for the sound - although the use of the opening theme in crucial climaxes in episodes can tire you out, it makes the theme all the more memorable and iconic. The fighting spirit really comes through in the words and resonates with the messages the creators are trying to relay to the audience!\\n\\n\r\nYes, the plot is cheesy and childlike. Aliens trying to control the world with soccer? It seems like a little much. But remember that Inazuma Eleven was a show made to be popular with children. And what's more dire than an alien conquest, what's more, with soccer? The eight-year-old in me was on the edge of her seat. The ups and downs may have seemed too dramatic, but the whole \"overboard\" quality of the situations made it palatable for children - and the exhausted, too-tired-to-think brain of mine post-8-hour-shifts. Plus, the drama made it difficult to stop watching. It's a win-win! The plot was also not dumbed-down to the point where adult viewers could not tolerate it, making it a show to be watched by all ages. \\n\\n\r\nFor what it was meant to be, Inazuma Eleven goes above and beyond with its splendid animation, evasion of mediocrity, and its both consistent and just-sophisticated-enough plot. I would definitely recommend if you're looking for something that won't wear you out!",
