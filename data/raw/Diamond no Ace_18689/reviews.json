Overall, characters psychology and in-game tension is here one of the best you could find in an anime sport, but that's it : for the rest, this anime is way deserved by a pitiful story, pretty much non-existent, and full useless and unbearable flashbacks to know more about characters that will STILL lose at the end (most of the time). You want something original and crazy ? Go for One Outs, that's way better.",

            "content": "This was my first venture into the sports anime genre, and DnA just sucked me into it like a black hole. I've never watched a single baseball game in my life and I've never showed any interest in the sport. I honestly thought that I wouldn't like this show, but if it's good enough to get approved for 52 episodes in its first season (and the fact that it was being produced by Madhouse), I thought I'd give it a try. I can honestly say that DnA has become one of my all-time favourite shows.\r\nThe story (10/10) is pretty straightforward: we follow Sawamura's journey asa pitcher as he grows and develops his skills in order to become the ace of Seidou's (famous) high school baseball team. But the show provides us more than just following Sawamura's journey; we basically get an overall glimpse of how high school baseball in Japan. The show definitely takes its time to progress, and we don't really see Sawamura beginning to grow until we're about 12 or so episodes in. But, in the episodes before that we see exactly why it took him a while and how hard he's worked up till then; we also get to see a pretty touching relationship develop between him and his future mentor.\\n\\n\r\nThough I initially did get the feel that Sawamura is the absolute MC, as the story progressed and more characters were introduced, there was a slight focus shift where Sawamura was undoubtedly still the MC, but the other Seidou team members were also just as important.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that the story always provides and excels at is: SUSPENSE. DnA knows hows to build up suspense leading up to the final scene in every episode, especially in the later episodes when they're in the Koshien qualifying matches.\\n\\n\r\nThe art (8/10) to be honest, didn't really sit well with me in the first episode (and only the first episode; I know, shame on me for judging a show based only one episode). But now, I don't even remember the reason I didn't like it. I re-watched episode 1 and I can only conclude that maybe it was because I wasn't expecting the show to be great and the relatively slow start of that episode that caused me not to like the art immediately. Overall, no complaints; the only reason it didn't get a higher score was because I've been spoilt with unique and or eye-popping art styles lately (Haikyuu! being the best) and can't help but compare them.\\n\\n\r\nThe baseball-playing scenes are very well-done especially some of the pitches which are animated showing clear movement of the ball (slow-mo shots of how the ball moves, or a clear arrow-like streak of light to see the course of the ball). Especially Sawamura's unique pitching form is well done. I never tire of seeing it. In later episodes, we also get to see how genius of a catcher Miyuki is with a few amazing saves.\\n\\n\r\nBecause comedy is a big part of this show, sometimes we'll see chibi forms pop out now and then, or sudden solid-colored background changes (with sfx and the like) when the mood switches suddenly from serious to funny.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the animation gives off a very shounen-like vibe: we get to see red-colored and blue-colored demon eyes for when they're fired up, players aura engulfing their bodies like a flame when they're pumped up, etc.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now onto the TWO PARTS that truly make DnA the great show that it is, the show's soundtrack (and sound effects) and its impressive cast of characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe SOUND (10/10) of this show is just... flawless (swoon). Madhouse somehow just knows how to perfectly fit the background music to whichever scene comes up which in turn really made me feel the intensity/emotion every scene: whoever came up with the score deserves an award (if he's not already gotten one).\\n\\n\r\nAnd the sound effects give me the chills every time: the ball hitting the mitt with a resounding BAM! (or when Furuya throws it's more like thunder splitting open a tree), the sound of the metal bat hitting the ball (or when Raiichi hits it, more like canon fire) vs the sound of Haruichi's wooden bat hitting the ball, etc.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors did (and still do) an amazing job; their voices fit the characters perfectly. If you check out their impressive resumes, it's definitely no wonder.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the OPs and ED's:\\n\r\nBoth OP's so far are by the same artist, and they're really good (and revved me right up); though I'm enjoying the 2nd OP more; I can't help but shout \"Fight!\" as well every time I hear it, putting me in Seidou-cheering mood.\\n\r\nThe ED's have also been good, though not as good as the OP's. The 4th ED, which is sung collectively by 3 of the 4 main cast members, is a really nice tune.\\n\\n\r\nThe CHARACTERS (10/10) are all loveable and memorable. Though we have the main cast consisting of 4 people, the supporting cast is nothing to sneeze at.\\n\\n\r\nSawamura is the loud, cheerful, wears his heart on his sleeve kind of guy. So what kind of quirk does he have that makes him the MC? He's a southpaw (left-handed) pitcher and has a peculiar pitch (both of which make him a unique type of player). But, even though he's unique he isn't the type of MC that's super-talented right from the start, he doesn't suddenly \"power up\" in the middle of a game, is unstoppable and wins all the matches; on the contrary, he gets into Seidou and quickly realises it's not as easy as he thought to become the ace because there are other people there who are more skilled than him. He falters during important moments, and even if he doesn't get back up immediately, he does eventually pick himself up and learns to move on. In other words, he accepts that he has a lot of faults, and this is what makes him so likeable and seem more human. Though a bit of an idiot (well, a big idiot), he works hard, values friendship, supports the team and always puts 120% in everything that he does. And the best part for me, he's unpredictable. Just when you think he's turning the corner and well on his way to becoming the ace, he messes up a play or does something really silly. I'm always on edge with him.\\n\\n\r\nMiyuki, the genius catcher, is personality-wise, almost the exact opposite of Sawamura, except for the cheerful part. He's as crafty and intelligent as they come and though on the outside he's always smiling, he has a bit of a dark side. He's like the evil genius.\\n\\n\r\nFuruya is our MC's rival for the ace spot. At first glance, he looks like the cool and collected type of person, also; but after a while I found him to be an adorable idiot as well: not being able to catch a simple throw and his insta-snooze reaction amongst others.\\n\\n\r\nLast but not least of our main cast quartet, is Haruichi. Character-design wise, he's the cutest one. And though he might be cute, he's one amazing baseball player: not only is he a batting prodigy, but an exceptional fielder as well. At the same time, he's so humble and shy. Cuteness overload!\\n\\n\r\nAnd then we have the other Seidou members, who all play an important role in the show. All have distinctive and quirky personalties and you will grow attached to at least one after watching DnA.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as enjoyment (10/10) goes, I am thoroughly enjoying watching every second of DnA. Whenever I watch it, i can always expect a good dose of humour interlaced with the appropriate amount of emotional moments and also a killer cliff-hanger. I wait eagerly for Saturdays to roll around and every time I finish watching the latest episode, I want to jump out the window because it's going to take another week before I can watch the show again.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9.6/10) I would recommend anyone to start watching DnA immediately, even if you've never seen a baseball match before, even if you know absolutely nothing about the game (but after watching the show, I got so curious I even googled basic baseball rules, pitch types and the structure of Japanese high school baseball tournaments). And I envy you if you haven't watched it yet, because you'll be able to marathon the show, so you don't have to get as frustrated as me with those cliffhangers. :)",

            "content": "Diamond no Ace isn't completed at the time of this review, but I wanted to write a positive review on the anime so maybe more people would watch it. Diamond no Ace is one of the most enjoyable anime I've ever seen. Of course you must be wondering how watching an anime about baseball could possibly be so enjoyable. I'm not much of a baseball fan or sports fan for that matter myself, but Diamond no Ace succeeds in drawing the viewers into all the excitement of the sport with all it's dramatized action. \r\nThe story isn't anything unique or original. The plot is basicallythe same as any other sports anime: the main character, who starts off with almost nothing, journeys to become a great player who eventually wins the trust of his teammates and fights to win a championship. Of course along the way he must endure and go through lots of hardships, obstacles and as hard as it may be, develop friendships with his other teammates. That main character in Diamond no Ace's story would be Eijun Sawamura, a pitcher who attends Seido, an elite baseball school. Eijun is a hard-working, determined boy who used to play baseball because he wanted to have fun with his friends, but as the plot develops, he plays baseball in order to become the ace pitcher of his school's team, and become a winner. To add onto the sports aspect of the anime, the plot also takes place in school for a lot of times (some real comedy relief from the seriousness of the baseball matches). The development of friendship between teammates/friends, and rivalries between opponents were masterfully done. The suspense build-up and excitement in the baseball matches were quite shocking to me, because I didn't expect baseball to seem so epic and entertaining. \\n\\n\r\nPersonally I think that the biggest strength of Diamond no Ace is the variety of interesting characters and how much time is being spent developing the characters aside from the main character, Eijun Sawamura. Eijun, despite being the focal point of the plot, almost feels like a vessel through which the viewer can see and interact with the other side characters. Because the sport of baseball makes it necessary for a lot of characters, there are a lot of characters. But almost none of the side characters are shown just for a gimpse in an episode, then to be found nowhere the next episode. All the characters have some kind of development and unique trait to them that makes them all memorable. I could discuss in detail about 10 other characters in the anime, but since that'd take too long, I'll mention just one other character: Satoru Furuya, who is Eijun's rival for the \"Ace Pitcher\" spot on the team. He's very bad at communicating/getting along with other people, and is keeps to himself for the most part. It's revealed in his past that he never got along and was never accepted by his teammates, but on Seido, he finally does get acceptance by his teammates, leading him to show a tiny bit more emotion. His passion for baseball and determination matches that of Eijun, and so their rivalry for the ace pitcher position takes root, but they also seem to development a friendship and sort of respect/understanding for each other. Diamond no Ace's use of characters is easily a 10/10. \\n\\n\r\nThe music and art in the anime were definitely good. The openings for Diamond no Ace set the exciting tone to come in the anime. The other soundtracks used during the baseball matches managed to amplify the suspense in each moment. The sound of each hit was looouuuudd!! But that also added suspense. The art in the anime was very bright, colorful, and clear; the art that I like. The baseball matches were drawn to near perfection. The characters were all distinctively drawn. The voice acting was superbly done; it must have been hard for them to be yelling all the time. \\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment aspect of the anime was \"high\". Before watching this anime, I didn't expect much, I just watched it because it was on the recommendations list for Haikyuu, one of my favorite anime. But, I was to be surprised to say the least. Diamond no Ace switched around from school-life friendships to off the field issues, to the fantastic baseball matches, never failing to keep me interested. I'd tell all sports-lovers to watch Diamond no Ace, and I'd recommend anyone else to give Diamond no Ace a shot (maybe first 10 episodes), because it's definitely an anime worth giving a chance. Hehe, thanks for reading and I hope you do give Diamond no Ace a watch!",

            "content": "I have never written a review before, nor had I planned to. And I really dont care how un-review-like this review may be. I had to do it. I had to make an exception, just for this series, because I don not think that this series has got the credit or acknowledgement that is deserves. I will not go into detail about the story, the characters, sound or any of that (HOWEVER, I love the opening, story, characters and art.. such beautiful art...) \r\nAll I will say is this: This show is amazing.\r\nIts hilarious. Its intense. Its my favourite anime EVER. (and that's saying something)\r\nIhave not seen any other sports anime (apart from YowaPedal which is also currently airing), so I have nothing to compare this to. I have not read the manga either; I was going to, but this show is so damn god I cant bring myself to spoil the next part of the story.\\n\\n\r\nI have seen a lot of anime, but never have I responded to any like this. After watching the latest episode (13) I downloaded the series and have since watched all the episodes up until then again. I seriously cannot get enough of this show!\\n\\n\r\nI feel so inspired by the main protagonist, Eijun Sawamura; he knows he is not the best, and very far from it. He does not know his potential and does not understand his true talent- which really stands out in this story. Us as viewers know he has it, and he has to become aware of it himself. He has an unwavering dream of becoming the best, the ace of the team, and is simply inspiring. I find it hard to describe, but if you watch the show, you are sure to understand. Though some may seem bothered by his personality, I love it. He is comical when he needs to be, but also serious and has unmatched trust and devotion to his teammates. Each character is individual and different, and it is hard not to like any of them.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the story goes, many people have dropped it because of the slow start- it currently has an unknown number of episodes and the manga is still ongoing, so it is likely to be a longer running anime. However, after episode 10, things start getting more intense, and episode 13 was absolutely perfect.\\n\\n\r\nIf you have spare time on your hands, go watch this. if you don't, go watch it anyway. If you think you don't like baseball (like me), watch it. I don't care. I think I'm becoming a baseball fan just because of this anime. I LIVE for my Sundays now, as soon as the latest episode is released, I drop everything to watch it\\n\\n\r\nI went into this anime not expecting much (not being a fan of baseball), and came out with it being my favourite anime of all time. This may not be everyone's cup of tea, but if even one person gets as much enjoyment and excitement out of this anime as I did, then my job is as good as done. So why are you still here? Go watch it!",

Although hailing from a country where Baseball is scarce, this started out to be a pretty interesting anime. It begins with an aspiring young pitcher named Eijun Sawamura, who throws a wild ball which flies over the catcher giving him no chance to seize it. This happens to grab the attention of a particular woman who turns out to be a scout for the baseball team of the highly popular school named Seido. Hence unfolding the journey which awaited Eijun in his future. \r\nWhat really got me into this at firstwas the soundtrack which had a pretty intimidating atmosphere. Even when I first heard the opening, \"Go EXCEED!!\", I was really fascinated by it and knew it was special. Same goes for the other two openings which approach as the show progresses. The endings were pretty fine too but average compared to the opening themes. \\n\\n\r\nAll the characters are pretty neatly drawn but there were some flaws too as most of the players in the team who rarely got featured were very dull to look at. \\n\\n\r\nI would gladly recommend Diamond no Ace to anyone who is into sports anime's. \\n\r\nThere is a second season coming out and I have high expectations for it.\\n",

            "content": "The one thing I felt missing from Major as much as I loved it, was how little of it was focused on high school baseball. \r\nDiamond no Ace, or Ace of the Diamond, differs from this and is quite strongly focused on high school baseball, and true to it's name focuses on finding the 'Ace' of the team; the pitcher that will bring the team to victory. \r\nBefore I go on I should mention the image you get of Sawamura from the first 2 episodes differs quite a little from how he ends up during the rest of the series. Think 'Small Town Hero, BigCity Zero.' :P\\n\\n\r\nThis isn't an anime about a kid with outstanding talent, it's about a boy who finds himself realising that the world of high school baseball is much bigger than he knew. Having been the star of his 'makeshift' middle school team he is thrown in the deep end when he encounters people with more obvious talents than himself.\\n\\n\r\nYes, he's got potential and yes there's the regular 'train to get stronger' theme that fits in perfectly within a sports setting. He has rivals within his own team, and due to his peculiar way of pitching* he has to prove himself to the large number of students also eager to make the starter team for Koushien. \\n\\n\r\nDnA has a great storyline, original perhaps not, but the relationships between the teammates, the 'senpai-kouhai' dynamics and the hands-on coaching, gives DnA its own flavour, not to mention it has no shortage of hilarious moments. Despite how slowly it starts off concentrating mainly on training, the 'real' matches begin and you will no doubt be rooting for this 'always out of reach' team to win, win and win in face of the unexpected adversity they encounter.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for romance you won't find any here, it's all about baseball, (and Sawamura being a fool). If you want something where the protagonist 'wins' all the time, then you're out of luck. If you want something where the main character is a diamond in the rough however, this is your thing. (Him and his peers).\\n\\n\r\nI don't like the pacing of the anime, but I could be biased having read the manga already. It's a bit too stretched out for my liking, which I think in an anime that doesn't carry the same buzz as Major did is a mistake. The voice acting is really on key, the characters all suit their voices, especially lil' old Harucchi who is my favourite character. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation aspect of it is slightly lacking, since it is a sports anime it should have a little more 'excitement' to it. \\n\\n\r\nPersonally I love it, you can relate to the MC, well at least I can. He struggles on whilst faced with the reality he is not the best, and it works well for him. I just hope other people like it too, because it gets much better, and since it's a very long-running series there is much more to it than what just one season will provide us with. Though even then it is still a really entertaining show to watch with plenty of good moments to keep you interested. \\n\\n\r\n*Sawamura does NOT have the same pitching style as Gorou-Major, his rival's pitching style is more similar to Gorou's. Sawamura's... well you just have to watch it and realise he is his own breed of awesome. :)\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "(This is a spoiler-free review adapted for this site)\r\n[Synopsis]: After failing to take his middle-school team to Nationals, Sawamura Eijun (Osaka, Ryota) decides to enroll at the prestigious Seidou High in order to pursue his aspirations in baseball. The story follows him and the Seidou team as he trains and practices to become the ace pitcher of the team and they try to restore Seidou to its former glory after it\u2019s 6 year absence from the Koushien championship.\r\n[Characters]:\r\nAs is the case with many sports shows, Diamond no Ace has an impressively large cast of characters and so I will address the cast mostly as awhole entity with some focus on the most primary characters.\\n\\n\r\nDespite there being multiple characters, such as Furuya Satoru and Miyuki Kazuya, who also recieve a good deal of the narrative spotlight, I think that Eijun is the indisputable protagonist and the show concerns itself first and foremost with his experiences at Seidou. With this being the case, I think one\u2019s enjoyment of the show can be either amplified or hampered by their level of enjoyment of Eijun though there are plenty of other characters who they might attach themselves to. He is strong-willed, boisterous, and at times obnoxious in his often overenthusiastic approach to things. He is extremely motivated towards reaching his goal of becoming the ace pitcher for the team as well as winning the summer tournament and attending Nationals. While Eijun has a few skills to start out with, his knowledge of pitching and of the sport is mediocre and so his learning as a first-year doubles as character progression for him and explanatory insight into the strategy of the game for the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nAlong with Eijun there are a few other first-year characters (and one second-year) who show notable growth throughout the series. Furuya Satoru is a highly talented pitcher who often acts as Eijun\u2019s rival on the team, Kominato Haruichi is the skilled younger sibling of one of the third-year students, and Miyuki Kazuya is an all-star catcher who enjoys manipulating and reigning in his unruly pitchers. The Seidou school accepts a great many skilled players however the most important of them belong to the First-String \u2013 primarily the third-year players and those skilled enough to win tournament games (the top 20 players for the summer tournament). While these people are the most often featured throughout the show as they play in all of the important games, they are a little slow to be explored initially and not every player is as memorable as the next even on the main team.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters not part of the main team, because it is impossible to present an entire team that is foreign to the audience with the same level of intrigue as the main cast, the opposing teams most often feature between 2 and 3 characters of note \u2013 one usually with slightly more backstory or context than the others. In this way, the teams themselves are not very memorable however they can be identified easily enough by means of their noteworthy player(s). These characters are usually interesting enough however I found that a good deal of the opponents were not as memorable as I might have wished with the exception of a select few. Overall, the method used here is both sufficient and necessary and certain viewers may gravitate in interest towards one interesting player or another.\\n\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]:\\n\\n\r\nI found the art and animation to be highly consistent throughout the show despite its 75-episode length and at no point did I find there was a notable drop in quality. The character designs are pretty subdued as the show comes off as fairly realistic in its approach and so the players look normal while each appearing different enough to be distinguishable from one another. I myself was felt underwhelmed with the art style if only in that it felt like a pretty standard approach to things and didn\u2019t feature anything particularly adventurous however it works perfectly well for what it tries to do and I have no actual qualms with the designs or animation. It was well done however was not done so in such a way that I would actively list it as a strength of the show. In the same vein of the unadventurous approach, I thought that the comedic scenes and comical faces and animations were pretty run of the mill and I didn\u2019t think any gag save maybe 2 really did much for me throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nOne of my biggest gripes with the show appears in this category and that is its rampant overuse of the \u2018white background\u2019 effect. In moments of intensity or drama, it can be visually helpful to have the scenery and setting fall away in place of the character\u2019s reaction or realization and add to the emotion or excitement of the moment however in the case of Diamond no Ace I found it made such excessive use of this technique that it felt exhausted after just a handful of episodes. There are plenty of cases within the show where it uses the white background successfully however with its appearance 4 to 5 times an episode for 75 episodes, its usage firstly comes off as a bit boring and secondly somewhat tarnishes what could have otherwise be well executed uses of the technique in later scenes. What I want for the show in the future is for it to allow the scenes and sentiments stand on their own from time to time while avoiding the usage of a potentially good concept.\\n\\n\r\n[Story]:\\n\\n\r\nThe show starts a little slow as it introduces us to Eijun and subsequently the structure of Seidou High. While this pacing is retrospectively not an issue within the context of its 75-episode length, it is quite slow by other standards. I felt it took nearly 20 episodes to start rolling which can be quite demanding if someone is trying to get into the show. The show has a good deal of drama however I thought that at least the early episodes came off as a little melodramatic whereas the later parts of the show address more interesting and legitimate problems and dilemmas.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing of the games was actually quite an interesting element of the show. At times the games would start off with the first at bat and play out for a good while from there however there were plenty of instances where the show would launch into a prospective game after a couple innings. I found this allowed the games to focus around the compelling parts of the game while avoiding perhaps some of the more typical moments. It also allowed for the show to setup certain situations without having to spend time prefacing itself \u2013 the game could start with 2 runners on base and a full count and you are immediately brought into the excitement of the moment. The end of the games were also sometimes subject to this approach in that, after resolving the key drama of the game or watching a major game-changing play, the game would end as expected and it would skip ahead to the celebration or the aftermath. Overall, I found this kept things fresh and cut out things that otherwise may have seemed grating and so this narrative technique I found to be a strong point within the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is, to a degree, pitcher-centric which is somewhat to be expected given the main character\u2019s vocation and the way baseball is played \u2013 it simply wouldn\u2019t be as interesting if it focused on left field or the shortstop. Because of this necessary focus, we spend a good deal of time, especially in the early half of the show, with the pitchers of the Seidou team. They each have their own unique style; for instance Eijun is known for his unwieldy and aggressive but hard-to-hit pitches whereas Furuya throws an incredible fastball. The show features good progression in the way of their pitching styles and approaches however because each pitcher has a lot of ground to cover, the pitching styles start off rather stark and simple. This can be problematic in the first half of the show because the lack of a dynamic strategy within the main focus of the games can come off as a little boring and it takes a while before things start to mix up.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, because the show takes a long time to get moving and must introduce a lot of different players on the main team, the highlighting of the opposing players starts off a little lackluster whereas the show gets much better at presenting these characters as the show progresses. As Seidou faces tougher and tougher teams in either tournament games or scrimmages, the number of interesting opponents on any one team gradually grows slightly which I felt helped the opposing teams seem more formidable. The progression from one team with a single outstanding player towards one with multiple was an interesting way to evolve the gameplay without making certain players seem unnaturally good or other teams much worse than they were \u2013 each team feels like a legitimate challenge at some level.\\n\\n\r\n[Music]:\\n\\n\r\nThe music is good enough however I felt it was almost non-present in the early episodes of the show as far as impact is concerned \u2013 it was discernible but dialed back. The music was decent when it came around however it didn\u2019t blow me away with its appearance despite adding to the scenes successfully. As the show progresses into the later half of the episodes I found that there were maybe 2 to 3 recognizable songs that would play repeatedly in accordance with the big action scenes or dramatic moments. They worked well however I felt the show was somewhat lacking diversity in this area and I would have liked a few more songs of note to have appeared in this same manner and with similar levels of execution.\\n\\n\r\n[Final Thoughts and Rating]: \\n\\n\r\nDiamond no Ace is a show that accomplishes what it sets out to do. It does baseball well and the characters and plays are appealing enough that one can easily find themselves interested in the outcome of things. Some areas where the show loses some points for me are the sometimes obnoxious nature of the protagonist, the somewhat uninspired art approach, the overuse of certain dramatic visuals, and the slow to start pacing of the show. I also felt that the comedy was pretty lacking despite its frequent presence in each episode. It came off as very bland both in terms of the gags and the character reactions and really didn\u2019t further my enjoyment of the show in any way.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 7\\n\\n\r\nI gave the show a 7 because, either by way of its high points or its consistent appeal, the show was enjoyable. It falls short in a few regards as discussed above and many of those things are fairly subjective to me and so it\u2019s perfectly reasonable that anyone who finds themselves more engrossed in either the main character or the beginning of the show will enjoy the show a good deal more as it only gets better as it continues.\\n\\n\r\n[Recommendations]:\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend Diamond no Ace to any sports fan as I think it does the genre well. The show has good dramatic moments that usually come with the territory of sports and so I would recommend it for that reason as well. Those interested in inter-team rivalry would do well to watch as there is a fair amount of competition in this regard which is not something I see in every sports show.",

The story starts off with our main character Sawamura Eijun, he loves baseball and has a goal of going to nationals with his group of friends. After losing a game, one day Sawamura gets called downstairs to find out he has been invited to Seido High School, which is apparently famous for its strong baseball team. At first Sawamura declines the offer because of his friends but visitingthe school and meeting a few, lets say, interesting characters, changes his mind and soon after he starts his journey to become the ace of Seido baseball team. \\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10) \\n\r\nI saw no real problem with the art in this anime, actually its really well done. It is consistent and never drops in quality.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10)\\n\r\nSo far all of the OPs and EDs have been good, I didn't feel the urge to skip them, in fact I find myself enjoying listening to and watching them. The background music is also very good, it helps set the sometimes tense and sometimes exciting atmosphere in each and every game. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9/10)\\n\r\nI love all of the characters so far, and there is a lot of them, but each and every one is different in their own way. Its interesting to see some of the characters stray away from the generic characters you usually find in sports/shounen animes. I also like that you get to know a lot about the supporting characters instead of just focusing on the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10)\\n\r\nDiamond no Ace is an extremely enjoyable anime, it has the ability to make you laugh but can also get you on the edge of your seat in some of the intense moments, it had me watching episode after episode and once i had got up to date i almost wished there were another 45 episodes so i could keep going.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10)\\n\r\nSo far Diamond no Ace has been an exciting anime that will easily have you hooked. The animation is very well done, the soundtrack is fitting and the characters are outstanding. This is definitely an anime worth watching!",

            "content": "NOTE - Do NOT be fooled by the first few episodes or the sport. This is pretty much the Hunter x Hunter 2011 of Shounen sports anime. Starts off typical and ends up something completely different.\r\nStory - 10/10\r\nThe story is for me split into 2 parts. The first part (episodes 1-20) is used to introduce the characters, the game and the world of this anime. It does so by relying on cliche's. Its the weakest part of the series.\r\nThe second part is episode 20 onwards. This is where the writers talent really shines. After going through all the cliche's most of the setup is donefor the main teams and we enter our first major arc. This arc is only a taste of what's to come, it has everything. The series becomes much more strategic, much more tense, much more emotional, much faster paced, and much much more unpredictable. \\n\r\nThe writing is exceptional in every regard. From tone shifts, to little bits of foreshadowing, everything is perfectly written. Its one of the few anime that even after a major shift in the story which completely changes the series and characters forever, it still manages to impress me in all the ways it previously had. \\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation - 9.5/10\\n\r\nFor a 75 episode series the art and animation is absolutely breathtaking. Its no surprise knowing that this is done by the two leading studios in the industry, Madhouse (HxH2011) and Production I.G. (Kuroko no Basket, Haikyuu, Attack on Titan). Take the beautiful art of Hunter x Hunter 2011's Chimera Ant arc and merge with the fluidity and intensity of Haikyuu and that's the art and animation in a nutshell. Its done in a way that the slow sport of baseball ends up being much more intense than a basketball match from Kuroko No Basket. It's beautifully done. Only major flaw is that some episodes, especially when the studios have new anime starting at the same time, tend to have simplified art, but it is still acceptable as they are in the minority.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10/10\\n\r\nThe music of this series is phenominal. The ost sounds very similar to that of a work by Hiroyuki Sawano, consisting of guitar solo's, rock instruments, large orchestrations and even a cover of a song from Micheal Bay's Transformers! (which far outdo's the original)\\n\r\nThe opening's and ending's are especially note worthy. In particular those done by GLAY and the band consisting of the composer and co-composer called OxT (you may know them from Overlord's opening)\\n\r\nI'd also like to take a moment to talk about the voice actors. HOLY S H I T! (excuse my language) There talent is amazing. It's so obvious that they are pouring there heart and soul into this and the ending themes they themselves create are some of the best ending themes of there year. (Final Victory by the Voice Actor of our main character is easily my ending theme of last year)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - I've already watched the anime 5 times in the past 4 months.... its saddening I can't give it more. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10/10\\n\r\nWith absolutely phenomenal writing that has the ability the grab your heart and stomp it almost every episode, either through heart breaking scenes that are expertly animated and directed, or moments of hope when your heart is jumping with joy at the pleasure of having this experience, this is an anime that is beautifully directed, flawlessly paced, phenomenally written, flawlessly composed and beautifully animated, this is easily in my opinion the greatest sports anime of all time, and easily one of the greatest anime of all time.\\n\\n\r\nPeople who think it will be useless and boring because its about baseball let me leave you with this....\\n\r\nMADHOUSE X PRODUCTION I.G.

            "content": "This review may be biased as baseball is definitely not my cup of tea, but comparatively to other sports and specifically baseball animes I've seen, this one is near the bottom. Nevertheless, Diamond no Ace does it's job well- it stuck to it's focus on baseball, developed a strong cast of likable characters, made every game exciting, and for the most part followed a reasonable plot. If you're looking for an anime entirely dedicated to baseball, this is it. \r\nMy 5 rating is very harsh considering this show does a lot of things well, notably establishing one of the most enjoyable, unique, and vast castof characters. But for a show that is entirely dependent on it's hype, I lost interest too frequently. \\n\\n\r\nConsidering the sheer length of this show, not much happens. Our MC Eijun is scouted for a prestigious baseball school, assimilates to the baseball club, and goes through a tournament. This could theoretically fit 75 episodes with extensive background development of side characters, episode-long training montages, school life, maybe even romance- but that just doesn't happen. The tournament starts at around episode 20, meaning this is a 55 episode tournament arc- it's inherently too long. And yet the show focuses on nothing but the tournament for the following 50 episodes. This means each game becomes progressively longer to fill the inevitable empty space, and that entails constant flashbacks & mundane camera angels between every. single. pitch. I am not exaggerating when saying most flashbacks (which are plentiful) play up to 10 times throughout the tournament arc; the games became awfully slow- painfully slow. \\n\\n\r\nAnd while this is very common in shounen, this one really pushes the boundaries. While overusing cliche flashbacks and showcasing the dugout and crowd every 30 seconds, the dramatization never ends which turns itself dull. Yelling is initially exciting, but at some point it becomes too much, unfortunately, that's the case here. With most games lasting 9 innings, the intelligent-based cast are bestowed closeup screen-time to let the audience know something important is finally about to happen. But the further the tournament progresses they start proclaiming every single inning as the turning point; They start crying wolf. The anime's pattern in general became very predictable, and I ended up skimming through the end due to lack of interest. \\n\\n\r\nLastly the plot is very odd, and personally not to my liking. When following a shounen MC I'm expecting him to be the best. Not from the get go, but he needs to prove his promise. And while Eijun is given immeasurable chances to do so, he seems to always fail when it matters- not once, always. And considering his teammate rival Furuya is outright superior in every sense, seeing Eijun failing again and again and yet still getting supported becomes discouraging. He is in the 1st-string of one of the best baseball schools by sole virtue of his lucky and unique pitching form, and he never pulls through. Either make him struggle more before he makes it or have him be useful. People, even in fiction, don't get this much back patting. His character design is good, its a waste to have him stubbornly cling to his weaknesses. His existence in the team doesn't really make sense, might as well have Furuya as the MC, he gets to play nearly twice as much as Eijun. \\n\\n\r\nThe Characters, art, and sound all range from 7-10, but the story and dependent hype enjoyment just doesn't hold up. If you're looking for either a baseball or sport anime, there is better out there. But if you truly love baseball animes, the cast, don't mind hours of ideal time, and already watched the better shows, this isn't the worst of them either.",

This is a kind of anime which makes you watch for more after each episode. This anime does character development superbly.\r\nStory 9\r\nThe story of this anime is well written. IT shows all the aspect of main character life as well as gives enough story of side characters. It knows the perfect timing of telling the story of character and makes sure that person watching it doesn't get bored. Even though the story is well written the episodes in the series feela bit stretched. In the end the story feels good if you watch it in whole completed series, and beware that series doesn't have the main ending instead it stretch out to second season.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8\\n\r\nThe art in this anime is pretty good. I also can't say that it is too good counting that it is a newer series. The art is good enough that it is not worse like 'ping pong' nor it is as good as 'free'. In the end art is well fitting for the anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9\\n\r\n This anime is one of the best baseball anime which only focuses on the sports rather than making a romance out of it. This anime in my opinion very much in top five best sports anime. In the end, Diamond no ace is a treat to watch and a fabulous anime.",

            "content": "This anime is not yet completed but I am up-to-date in the episodes and have watched every single episode that is out so far. I wanted to give this anime a review however of what I've seen so far. I watched a couple of sports anime before I started watching this anime but I never had seen a baseball one before. This anime did not disappoint. The reasons why is not because the characters \"love the sport\". In every sports anime a character has to love the sport in order for it to even be considered a sports anime. No, the reason that I foundthis anime very intriguing is because of the characters. Never have I ever been so in love and involved with characters from an anime before. I mean I've seen a lot of sports animes and this anime's storyline is no different from the rest but man the characters are really what keeps you watching this anime.\\n\\n\r\nSawamura Eijun, is an open book, loud and very oboxious and like basically what everyone calls him in the anime he is a complete and utter idiot when it comes to baseball. That is why he is so lovable. He is a character you want to root for and you want to succeed. It is because he isn't amazing at the sport that makes the character really relatable. He becomes real. When Eijun is learning about the sport those of us who don't know the sport are learning as well. So in that sense Eijun is essentially the \"viewer\". You make think that sound crazy but I believe when watching this anime it literally feels like you become the characters. I easily found myself in every character because each character all have one aspect that is purely \"their  character\" if that makes any sense haha. I could go in full detail on every main character in this anime but that would just take too much time. However, I will point out a few characters watch out for.\\n\\n\r\nMiyuki Kazuya, is the essential catcher of the first string team of Seidou. The character is very essential in bringing out Eijun's potential. That is because he is the one who catching  Eijun's pitches. He has what the other characters of the anime say \"twisted personality\" but  despite that he is a truly amazing baseball player. He even was showcased in sports magazines in the anime. That is how skilled of a catcher he is.  His dynamic with Eijun is pretty amazing. Despite the fact that Eijun doesn't respect him (because of his twisted personality) like he does with his other sempais, Miyuki is someone that Eijun needs to become a better pitcher and grow into a better baseball player.\\n\\n\r\nFuruya Satoru is literally and emotionless character. He literally always have a blank face unless he feel faint or two he feels really furious. He is an amazing fastball pitcher and is more skilled that Eijun is in regards to pitching which makes him Eijun's rival in becoming the \"ace of the diamond\".\\n\\n\r\nKominato Haruichi is another essential character in this anime. He hasn't gotten much story so far in the anime but the fact that he has to live up to his older brother Kominato Ryousuke makes his story so appealing as well. There are so many other characters that I can explain but these are the main ones that you really follow throughout the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe rivalry between Seidou and Inashiro is the true driving force of this anime. Every episode is leading up to this \"Final Game\" that decides which team gets to go to Nationals. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I truly enjoyed about this anime is that every game shown you see a character grow or break. Each game something happens that pulls you into the game and make you root for Seidou. What is also amazing is that Seidou truly is a team just like how Sohoku is truly a team in Kuroko No Basuke.  The players of Seidou truly know how to work together and make such amazing plays that is just astounding. Sure the point of the anime is to find the true \"Ace\" of the team and I understand that the \"Ace\" is essential to the team since the \"Ace\" is the one that holds the team together during a game but because Seidou doesn't have a true \"Ace\" makes this anime really special. The whole anime follows specifically Sawamura Eijun a novice pitcher. He and the rest of the pitchers, Furuya, Kawakami and Tanba all fight for the \"Ace\" title. I have to admit that yes one these pitchers actually does get the \"Ace\" number but is he really a true ace? Even the coach doesn't really truly know that yet. \\n\\n\r\nPoint is that this anime really had me reeled in because of the characters and because the anime is still exploring on what a \"true ace of the diamond\" is. I won't stop watching this anime until the very end. Everyone who loves sports anime should really give this anime a shot. Even if you don't really like baseball you will find this anime very enjoyable. I never liked baseball but this gave me a new perspective of the sport and taught me so many things I never knew about the sport. It isn't just a sports anime where the characters have to win the championship or go to nationals no its a sports anime in which you have not only go to nationals but also figure out the true meaning of the title of the anime \"Ace of The Diamond\" and that's something other sports animes don't have. Something in which the main character wants to become. Other sports anime the team and main characters only want to become national champions and winners or become a \"true team\" but in this sports anime the main character wants to become the \"Ace of The Diamond\" and because the fact that the main character has the spirit but not the skills makes this show really worth watching.\\n",

            "content": "I was initially introduced to this show when through a comment on a show saying \"Man.. Ace of Diamond makes my Saturdays better.\" Having no expectations for this show, I decided to watch it because I had not else better to watch. I mean, let\u2019s be real\u2026 With Basketball, and Volleyball, and Soccer, and other sports, Baseball is obviously not the most exciting sport to watch. But man, was I wrong.The first click to episode 1 landed me to episode 13. Marathoning all the airing episodes, I was so excited and couldn't focus on any other anime or school work, or sleep or anything atall. \\n\\n\r\nThe art, story, sound and character are elements that help make this anime shine;but the one element that distinguish this anime from a diamond and a mere crystal are the characters. At first impression, Eijun Sawamura may only appear to be a  a silly boy with a talent for baseball; however, that is not all this anime presents. Sawamura is carefree but not lazy, rowdy but still serious, simple but not brainless. Even though this is a show that is shown on a screen, each and every one of the character traits are delivered appropriately. As if the characters were flesh and blood, you could see their disappointment, cheer them on their success and laugh with them on their mistakes.Sure, you can watch an anime and know which character is an idiot or an intellect,talented or not,but, very rarely, would there be an instant where you could watch an anime and actually know about the characters as if they were your best friend. All the characters such as Sawamura, Furuya, Ryousuke, Yuki and  his teammates and their rivals are created and developed splendidly.To be honest, this was one of the few anime where I remember most of the names of the characters. I mean I don't even remember what I wore yesterday or what my breakfast was, so imagine how I managed to remember 50 characters in a show..\\n\\n\r\nWhile the story may seem to follow the typical sports anime route, the most important aspect about the story is the message it delivers:\"Not everyone is good at first.\" \"Practice makes permanent.\" The best feature of this anime is that it motivates individuals to strive to improve and practice. Whether it be baseball, soccer, studying, piano, it is not talent that is the deciding factor, but ultimately, it is effort that counts.\\n\\n\r\n Along with the character and beautiful art, the soundtrack is gear that pumps motivation and excitement in the anime. I been waiting for 50 episodes for the soundtrack to get released and now it's finally out!! Not to sound crazy or anything,but I listen to the soundtrack to get inspired and find motivation to study and it works!\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I found this anime by surprise, and I can say I'm never so glad I didn't overlook it. This anime is a long adventure, but I can ensure you, it's not a boring one.  Throwing in interesting characters, humor, art and  amazing soundtracks, the producers have churned out an amazing sport anime. Whether you want to kill time, ease away your sadness, or look for motivation. This is the right sport anime for you. \\n",

            "content": "TLDR Review: \r\n     I don\u2019t exactly enjoy the idea of rating something before it\u2019s over but after 59 episodes I think I've gotten the gist of the show. From the standpoint of someone who has been around and played baseball since I was able to walk, Diamond no Ace is a show that gets baseball right. DnA is by no means a perfect show but in terms of understanding the sport of baseball and developing the characters as a result, it hits the nail on the head. So if you are looking for a realistic baseball anime then DnA should beon your very short plan-to-watch list. \\n\\n\r\nIn Depth Review: \\n\r\n    For me, personally, I've found shows that exceed the 20-30 episode mark are hard to get into. Though I never felt that while watching DnA, now whether that was because of my ability to relate to the characters and the situations or not could be left up for interpretation. DnA is simply the anime adaptation of the DnA manga that has been published since 2006 and is still publishing. The current show is being animated primarily by Production I.G. with help from Madhouse. The show begins with a practically hopeless pitcher by the name of Eijun Sawamura who has a couple tricks up his sleeve. Eijun is scouted during a game with his middle school team and ends up getting an offer to play baseball with one of the most renowned baseball high schools in all of Tokyo: Seido. The story picks up from there on, so for the sake of not spoiling anything major I will not say any more. With that aside lets begin with the actual review. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10 \\n\r\n    The story itself is not anything special, it follows your regular routine in a shonen similar to that of Naruto. Where the main protagonist is not reliable in the slightest but has the will and determination to get better, However the story begins to take a bit of a turn after the initial arc. The story turns more into the team itself instead of what the main character can accomplish and that in itself turns into one of the story\u2019s strong points. Granted that the story is a bit generic but you can\u2019t exactly expect much in that aspect from a light-hearted sports anime, what the show does it does to the best of its abilities. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10 \\n\r\n     The characters are one of, if not the strongest point of this show. As I said previously the show turns into more of the team and form that you don\u2019t just feel for one of the characters but everyone as a whole. You physically want them to win against every team they play against, following every player and hoping that they can do their part in sealing the win for the team. Characters are certainly something that this show did right and I feel other shows could learn from it.  \\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10 \\n\r\n     Unfortunately the art and animation suffer a bit because of the sheer length of the show. You can\u2019t exactly ask for gorgeous fight scenes, well in this case batting or fielding scenes. Mainly due to the fact that the animation studios simply do not have the money to invest into a 60+ episode series. I won\u2019t harp on the art for too long but they do again use it to the best of their abilities which is by no means a bad thing. All in all the art is not bad, it\u2019s just very mediocre from their excessive use of still frames and such. \\n\\n\r\nMusic/Sound Design: 7/10 \\n\r\n       In terms of sound and music design there really isn't much to choose from aside from the sounds of dialogue and baseballs being hit and caught. With the occasional hype music to keep you in tune with the scene. Aside from those sounds, which do in fact sound accurate, I can\u2019t REALLY rate this. So from that I just went with my go to rating, really nothing more to say about this. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10 \\n\r\n       Now I don\u2019t particularly like to rate things subjectively but because this one hit home (no pun intended) for me this is MY opinion on the show. It really reminded me of some of the things that baseball was to me, whether remembering these things are a bad thing or not I have yet to find out. The show suffers from small things such as many still frames and mediocre animation but that is not what makes this show great. The teamwork of everyone, the build-up of every antagonist and every game, giving characters that need a back-story one. Everything about this show just fits for what it is. Sports anime can be particularly hard to get into, especially if you don\u2019t understand many of the complex rules of the game such as baseball. However this show is by no means hard to get into and if you\u2019re looking for a longer sports show, give it a try. \\n",

            "content": "Yes, I know that that number of episodes are intimidating, but this anime is truly one of the greatest sports anime I have seen up to date. I normally do not like to watch sport animes, but after convincing myself to keep an open mind, I tried this anime out. And now i am simply hooked. I would like to say beforehand that this anime is not yet completed, everything in here is my own opinion, and that I definitely give this an a solid 10/10\r\nThe storyline is rather simple, but just to sum it up in a few words; Sawamura is a country boywho loves baseball, and gets scouted for Seido High School's baseball team in the city. A simple baseball anime but the way the story is played out is amazing! The character interactions and the  tournaments are very well developed and invigorating. The beginning starts off rather slow but intriguing enough to continue. However once you reach deeper into the anime, you have seen these characters work so hard and bond so well for so long that to see them win or lose completely moves you to feel as they do. Also this anime is very realistic about how baseball is played, how teams do win and lose, and does not have any ridiculous-named moves/attacks.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style might be what turns you away but I find it okay and very unique. Its graphics and animation is not out-of-this-world amazing, but its good enough to keep you okay with it and continue the show. But I do think that the animation for the game scenes are done rather well. The slow-motion or the fast-pace combined with the music really gets you absorbed into the moment\\n\\n\r\nThe OSTs are also something to be praised. I wouldn't call the music original but it has character to it. The OSTs fit into their respective scenes and some of them even have the power to move you to feel energized or sad or even shocked. As mentioned above the music combined with the scene in the game really has an impact.\\n\\n\r\nA 10/10 for these characters are very very well developed, and absolutely none are hate-able. There is a huge cast of different teams and its amazing how the mangaka is able to make each and every one of them special and different. Right off form the bat, I was able to remember who was who and their special little quirks that make them so likable! It is a pleasure to watch these different characters learn how to trust each other and form a team based connected and strengthen by their individual special skills. Ace of Diamond really shows how important teamwork and trust is in baseball and also in life. \\n\r\nYou can really see the strong bonds between characters and that shows in their great display of teamwork. I greatly admire all of the teamwork and friendship that the characters display. They act cute and funny with each other, but right in the next moment, can act serious. Especially after watching these characters struggle to improve themselves through hours of long practice and learn how to trust each other, you get really attached to them. You even get attached to the opponents because of how great they fought to win. \\n\\n\r\nYes that was a very long paragraph for characters, so all you need to really know is that these characters are extremely likable, display great teamwork, and have the funniest to the most serious interactions with one other.\\n\\n\r\nWhether or not you like sports anime will determine if you like this anime, but it certainly doesn't hurt to give sport animes a shot.  Ace of Diamond is realistic, funny, suspenseful, and, for me at certain scenes, tear-jerking. I am rather glad that I opened myself because then i would have never been able to have the pleasure in watching Ace of Diamond.",

            "content": "Spoiler free review\r\n\"I'm here to become the ace!\" - Sawamura Eijun\r\nDiamond no Ace is an exhilarating ride - filled with emotion that is complimented by exciting action.\r\nStory: If one has seen a substantial amount of high school sports anime, one will quickly begin to see that Diamond no Ace follows the typical formula for a successful sports anime albeit with alterations. This makes certain plot elements less meaningful and predictable, however the execution of these elements is skillfully done in order to differ from other titles in its genre.\r\nOn the other hand, if one isn't well-versed in this genre, then congratulations the experience will beamplified by two fold. Plot elements will be original, consequently resulting in the emotional aspects of the plot to be more effective that really pound one's heart.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation: The art quality is fair, it is not the best one has seen nor is it the worst. However, for a series that boasts a 75 episode count, it certainly is impressive that the art quality never deteriorated into a horrible mess, a testament to the studio's skill and organisation. \\n\r\nWhat really shines in Diamond no Ace is the animation quality. This is evidently demonstrated when pitches are thrown, one can really feel the intensity, speed and power. This is also the case for batting, catching etc. This type of fluid animation aids to further immerse the viewer into the world of Diamond no Ace.  \\n\\n\r\nSound: It is difficult to describe sound in a written review. Nonetheless, the sound in Diamond no Ace, in my humble opinion, is the best aspect of the series. Receiving a great rating of 9. The soundtrack (excluding openings and endings) really accentuates the character's emotions, their determination, conviction etc. It transforms the baseball field into an epic battlefield unveiling the tense and epic atmosphere the characters are experiencing. The complimenting soundtrack was what enabled me to become a fan of baseball, it converts viewers who never had an interest in baseball to enthusiastically watch and cheer for the team they like best (Seidou for most of us).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Diamond no Ace has a plethora of characters. This results in a lot of mentor, supporting and rival characters for our main protagonist, Sawamura Eijun to learn and grow from. The bonds that each of these characters share with each other is another aspect in which Diamond no Ace excels at. As we observe the characters throughout each episode, it is evident that all of them slowly grow, adding more depth to the characters which further immerses the viewer into this fictional world creating a more personal link with the characters of the series. However, having too many characters can deteriorate the plot and thus the effectiveness of the series. Although, Diamond no Ace creates great bonds between its characters, some of them seem quite one dimensional, this is especially the case for some of the supporting characters (third years). Furthermore, the overabundance of rivals, existing in the same team, creates a frustrating conflict for the main character. At times, it seems the main antagonist is the rival not the opposing team.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7 - A good rating\\n\r\nThrough the combination of impressive animation, decent visuals, amazing sound and a fair plot, the final rating for (non spoiler) Diamond no Ace is a good rating of 7. Worth checking out if you are a fan of sports anime in general. However the limitations due to the character and plot sections prevent this anime from reaching a greater score of an 8 or a 9.          \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review :) below is spoiler filled comment/rant discussing the character and plot sections of this anime.\\n\\n\r\n~~~~~~spoiler comment alert~~~~~~\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nFor those of you who have watched the series, i am mainly talking about Furuya. His character was interesting at first, i believed that he was going to be another obstacle to Eijun's journey in becoming the ace - which was built up from episode 1 and obviously the title reflects that the plot is going to be centered on his journey in becoming the ace, ultimately leading his team to victory.\\n\r\nFrom episode 1, the audience is teased that our main protagonist was going to form an unstoppable battery with Miyuki - the genius catcher. But this was not the case, as even in the manga Sawamura is still a bench warmer, and at this rate it seems Miyuki is going to graduate before Sawamura ever dreams of becoming the ace. I would understand about 20-30 episodes of Sawamura becoming a bench warmer to Furuya, in order to train and build more character depth in order to return stronger. But unfortunately this was not the case. Even in season 2 of the anime (episode 22 as of this date) and the manga - Sawamura is still a bench warmer. It appears that Sawamura is turning into a support character for Furuya - his rival. He is seen cheering Furuya and motivating him to pitch well, when in reality the main protagonist Sawamura should be pitching as the ace. It is incomprehensible that the main protagonist is reduced to be part of a supporting cast, as Furuya begins to form a battery with Miyuki. After enduring 65 episodes of Sawamura bench warming for Furuya and Tanba (i can accept this), the mangaka wants us to endure another 100 episodes of Sawamura bench warming, and now even being part of Furuya's supporting cast. I have heard rumors that the mangaka did not originally intend for Sawamura to be the main protagonist but instead have Furuya to be the protagonist, but his editor wanted Sawamura to be the main protagonist due to his Naruto/shounen like personality (no source). Nevertheless, it almost seems that Sawamura is shoehorned into the series at this rate.\\n\\n\r\nI am not a shounen fan or a Sawamura lover etc. It is frustrating that the character we followed from episode 1 and the character we have the most emotional attachment with is reduced to nothing but a supporting cast. It would of been perfectly fine for Furuya to be the main protagonist if we just followed his journey from the start instead of Sawamura's, as his character is much more unique and fresh to the sports anime genre.\\n\r\nI am also not a lover of overpowered naruto type of plots either ( i dislike them) , but enduring 65 episodes of training (im sweet with this - was a great arc) then another 30 episodes of bench warming (k, its sweet as long as we see him grow and in the end see him as the ace forming a battery with Miuyki as teased), but then realizing that even in the manga he is still a bench warmer -.- that's going to be like 100 episodes of bench warming and possibly Miyuki graduating before even forming a battery together. k no thanks -.-\\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, a good sports anime series - there is no denying that.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I have caught up with the current ongoing manga so my thoughts on the anime has changed a little since reading it\r\nStory -6 : The story of this series is very typical shounen material so its something you would expect from most sports anime. Usually a sports series is good because of its characters anyways so thats all I will say for the story.\r\nArt -7: I liked the art, it doesn't try to be too flashy, and characters all have different designs so its easy to tell the difference. I think the anime does a decent job, especially when trying to portray the emotions ofcertain characters like when they feel frustrated the color of the backgrounds change with the emotions of the characters. I think the art of the manga is better though as the author is pretty good at drawing the faces of his characters, especially the eyes. Really brings out the intensity of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nSound -7: The sound was decent, although sometime the ost were repetitive, i enjoyed them. The sounds of the baseball bat hitting the ball is also repetitive but its not an issue for me. The openings were great and the endings were ok. The best part is for sure the voice acting. The VAs are so into their roles that they hold special events to do with this series and cosplay as the characters. There are even character songs of our favorite characters in the series which i recommend everyone to give a listen.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters -8: Now, like most sports anime this is the best part of a series . There are a lot of characters in this series and while not all of them are amazing, there are quite a few likable ones. Usually, the mc Sawamura eijun would be the main focus of the series. However, a lot of times the focus shifts to the Seido team as a whole. There are senpais in the series who are great supporting characters of the first years but they also have their own goals that they want to accomplish, to be a big contributor to the team. Seido baseball club is so lovable because of the interactions of all these characters as well as how they support one another or striving to improve themselves. \\n\\n\r\nYuki is the captain of the team so he has a lot of responsibility and usually gives his teammates encouragement. The most important characters to the mc are Miyuki the catcher and Chris the other catcher. Chris is the main support of Sawamura and is a big part of his development as a character. Chris himself was struggling because of an injury and this was also one of the reason why Sawamura developed. These characters support one another but are also self motivated.\\n\\n\r\nMiyuki, the main catcher of the team is sometimes the core of the team because he is the one who takes care of all the catchers. He has a carefree attitude and his teammates get pissed off because of him sometimes but they respect him a lot. Like Chris, his relationship with Sawamura is amazing and you get to see it from a realistic perspective. Miyuki's relationship with Sawamura is one of the best dynamics in the series. \\n\\n\r\nThe backstory of the characters are simple to understand, and although the series is never deep, its executed in a realistic way. Sawamura is still the main character and got the most development. He was a typical shounen mc at first but his characters development is done in the most realistic way possible. Many people complain that he gets overshadowed by his rival Furuya and doesn't get enough screen time but for me that was why I liked Sawamura even more. He struggled a lot and being an inexperienced first year, he had to learn a lot from his mistakes. Its amazing how much struggles he goes through and seeing him overcome them is satisfying. He has a loud personality but is also very self motivated, which makes him a perfect character to root for and makes him more suitable to be an ace. Season one is him discovering his potential from the help from others and from himself, and slowly developing it so his struggles made a lot of sense. His rival Furuya however, is different because he had natural talent from the start, which was a good contrast. Character interactions, relationships, and their goals is what makes this series great in its characters. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment -9 and overall : I enjoyed this series a lot. It can be slow in pace and some fans might still be angry or impatient about Sawamura struggling so much but for me thats why this series is so different than the other shounen. This series is nothing deep like Ping pong or Ashita no joe but its done realistically in shounen fashion. Its pretty similar to haikyuu but the writing is better imo because of how the sport of baseball is structured where there is a special meaning of being an ace in the team- a person who shoulders the hopes and dreams of everyone else and leads the team to victory, which is different than haikyuu because volleyball has way more teamwork in it. Mainly I love seeing Sawamura working hard to reach that goal of becoming an ace and he still has a lot to learn. \\n\\n\r\n7.5 is my score of the anime. I originally gave it at least an 8 but after catching up with the current manga, season 1 is good but not nearly as good as the current manga. I recommend more people to watch this anime because it is not that popular, yet I think anyone can come to know the purpose of the character struggles and learn to appreciate a writing like this.\\n\\n",

This review is also spoiler free.\r\nDiamond no Ace ( Ace of Diamond) is far too underated outside of Japan.\r\nThis year DnA was the 7th most sold manga in Japan (right behind Naruto) so that is proof enough of its greatness. \r\nThe story for DnA seems fairky straight forward, to make nationals. However the characters will and devotion to accomplish theis dream is inspiring.\r\nAlso there is so many funny and enjoyable characters in this show that it is hard not to like atleast one. I believe the characters make this show, they are easy to follow,relatable, funny and they way they bond and care with eachother leaves us as massive seido fans. (And Kura senpai's laugh)\\n\r\nThe art fits a sports genre well and is well detailed aswell as great op's. \\n\\n\r\nIt doesnt matter if you arent a sports genre fan, there far more to this show other than gameplay.i know DnA was my 2nd ever sports anime and now it is my all time favorite. I thoroughly reccomend this great and enjoyable series to anyone!  \\n\r\n9/10\\n",

            "content": "[This review contains minor spoilers. Major spoilers are obfuscated with a DVORAK-to-QWERTY substitution cipher. You should be able to find a translation webpage online.]\r\n[This is a review of both seasons, together.]\r\nI am glad that I watched this.\r\nI would recommend this to others.\r\nI have watched this once, subtitled. I have only watched the anime.\r\nI probably won't watch this again.\r\n---- Positives ----\r\nIt's acceptably easy to follow along even if you aren't familiar with baseball, to a degree.\r\nBecause the series primarily follows to growth of a pitcher who was never formally trained to pitch, during the series there's a decent amount of information regarding what types of pitchesexist. For example, you don't need to know what a \"changeup\" [pitch] is because Sawamura doesn't know either, so when he learns what it is, so do you. However, for the non-pitcher-related rules of baseball, you're pretty much on your own, though after some number of games and paying attention to dialogue, you should be able to figure out most of the rules, even if you know nothing of the sport. While knowing all the rules will make it easier to follow the games, the way in which the scenes progress makes it so that you only really need to know the utmost basics in order to enjoy the games, so even if you don't know anything about baseball, you should be able to figure out enough of the rules early on enough to enjoy the rest of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe games are all fun to watch.\\n\r\nAll of the scenes shown during the games are interesting to watch. Important moments happen in 1x time or slower, and unimportant, repetitive moments are usually skipped over. During the games, we primarily hear characters thinking to themselves or discussing strategy with each other. We are, as far as I could keep track of, always informed regarding unique styles of the players on both sides. You'll hear that one player on the other team is a fast runner, and then you'll see them steal bases. Sometimes, it happens the other way, such as a pitcher pitching a new type of pitch, then you see the batting team be surprised and do their best to adjust for that. This event-and-explanation pair are always very close together, so we never feel lost for very long during a game, and whenever you feel surprised, it's likely that some number of characters in the series are also surprised.\\n\\n\r\nThe team sends scouts to watch the games of their future opponents.\\n\r\nNot only does this allow Seidou to be prepared for their competition, it allows us to understand the other team ahead of time. Sometimes we'll even get to see flashbacks of the opposing team to better understand them.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing is uncharacteristically quick for a long-running series.\\n\r\nThis series has pacing that's almost slow enough to make you want to fast forward at times [such as the obligatory silent reaction frames for every major event], but is actually quick enough that I rarely had to actually do that. Having decent pacing really means a lot with this high of an episode count.\\n\\n\r\n---- Negatives ----\\n\\n\r\nThe series suffers from unlucky unpredictability.\\n\r\nWhen the series has tense, unpredictable moments, they will either end badly for Seidou, or Seidou will awkwardly overcome them. This definitely isn't a Hard Work Overcomes All Barriers success story. There is no meta force propelling the team to victory. --and considering how often there are tense, unpredictable moments, the entire series, for me, had this bizarre, uncomfortable feeling about it. Also, I felt that multiple teams deserved to win more than Seidou did - teams that ended up losing to Seidou for no particularly outstanding reasons. This realization of mine was not felt by Seidou.\\n\r\nOpportunity for cancel: No, because I don't think this series was going for realism, and, in addition, the focus of this series did not seem to be It All Comes Down To Luck.\\n\\n\r\nThe series lacks a consistent focus.\\n\r\nThe series comes close to having a focus, but every candidate is scratched out at some point along the series. The focus is not Hard Work Overcomes All Barriers, because many of the teams in this series that worked very hard, harder than Seidou did, lost. The focus is not It All Comes Down To Luck, though, if I had to identify this series' focus, that is what I would pick. The focus is not Let's Go To Nationals, because many risky, illogical plays are made that counter this goal, as even Ochiai points out multiple times in-series. The focus is not Let's Play Our Own Baseball, because there's too much focus on winning and too much focus on the negative aspects whenever the team loses. It has an awkward mixture of all these focuses and doesn't spend adequate resources to any of them.\\n\r\nOpportunity for cancel: No. It would have been a simple matter to choose any one or two of these focuses and shaped the series around them. The series would have ended stronger and would have had a stronger progression throughout.\\n\\n\r\nSawamura isn't treated well by the author.\\n\r\nThe way I thought Sawamura would grow throughout the series didn't happen at all. [Spoilers: D. b.k.p n.apbo dr, yr .q.py yryan jrbyprn rk.p dco mrkcbi uaoyxannw abe d. b.k.p x.jrm.o yd. aj. ru yd. y.amv]\\n\r\nOpportunity for cancel: No. This should have been the most obvious character progression in the series, and it didn't happen.\\n\\n\r\nTheir assistant coach, Ochiai, is an unnecessary jerk in most cases.\\n\r\nPartway through the series, Seidou gets an assistant coach. This coach meshes poorly with the team and the head coach. He spends the majority of his time criticizing the head coach and the players, as well as going around the team trying to make rifts solely for the purpose of, which he even states [as thoughts] multiple times, getting the talented players to like him better than they like the head coach - because Ochiai will favor them and give them special treatment.\\n\r\nOpportunity for cancel: No. However, I'll mention that Ochiai helps out the team with their technical skills much later in the series, and may have even directly enabled the team to get as far as they did. He also dials back his hostility toward the head coach and shows a more comical side near the end.\\n\\n\r\nThe art rarely, yet still, dips very low.\\n\r\nMy favorite bad shots were of the school band. The brief bleacher scenes were an occasional danger zone regarding art quality. I'm motivated to write this negative because of one band shot in particular where their instruments look really wrong.\\n\r\nOpportunity for cancel: Yes. Firstly, most of the art in the series is consistently acceptable - there are only rare occurrences of bad art. Secondly, this is a long-running series, and I've never seen a long-running series with outstanding art - I assume by now that these two things go hand in hand.",

            "content": "This was my first venture into the sports anime genre, and DnA just sucked me into it like a black hole. I've never watched a single baseball game in my life and I've never showed any interest in the sport. I honestly thought that I wouldn't like this show, but if it's good enough to get approved for 52 episodes in its first season (and the fact that it was being produced by Madhouse), I thought I'd give it a try. I can honestly say that DnA has become one of my all-time favourite shows.\r\nThe story (10/10) is pretty straightforward: we follow Sawamura's journey asa pitcher as he grows and develops his skills in order to become the ace of Seidou's (famous) high school baseball team. But the show provides us more than just following Sawamura's journey; we basically get an overall glimpse of how high school baseball in Japan. The show definitely takes its time to progress, and we don't really see Sawamura beginning to grow until we're about 12 or so episodes in. But, in the episodes before that we see exactly why it took him a while and how hard he's worked up till then; we also get to see a pretty touching relationship develop between him and his future mentor.\\n\\n\r\nThough I initially did get the feel that Sawamura is the absolute MC, as the story progressed and more characters were introduced, there was a slight focus shift where Sawamura was undoubtedly still the MC, but the other Seidou team members were also just as important.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that the story always provides and excels at is: SUSPENSE. DnA knows hows to build up suspense leading up to the final scene in every episode, especially in the later episodes when they're in the Koshien qualifying matches.\\n\\n\r\nThe art (8/10) to be honest, didn't really sit well with me in the first episode (and only the first episode; I know, shame on me for judging a show based only one episode). But now, I don't even remember the reason I didn't like it. I re-watched episode 1 and I can only conclude that maybe it was because I wasn't expecting the show to be great and the relatively slow start of that episode that caused me not to like the art immediately. Overall, no complaints; the only reason it didn't get a higher score was because I've been spoilt with unique and or eye-popping art styles lately (Haikyuu! being the best) and can't help but compare them.\\n\\n\r\nThe baseball-playing scenes are very well-done especially some of the pitches which are animated showing clear movement of the ball (slow-mo shots of how the ball moves, or a clear arrow-like streak of light to see the course of the ball). Especially Sawamura's unique pitching form is well done. I never tire of seeing it. In later episodes, we also get to see how genius of a catcher Miyuki is with a few amazing saves.\\n\\n\r\nBecause comedy is a big part of this show, sometimes we'll see chibi forms pop out now and then, or sudden solid-colored background changes (with sfx and the like) when the mood switches suddenly from serious to funny.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the animation gives off a very shounen-like vibe: we get to see red-colored and blue-colored demon eyes for when they're fired up, players aura engulfing their bodies like a flame when they're pumped up, etc.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now onto the TWO PARTS that truly make DnA the great show that it is, the show's soundtrack (and sound effects) and its impressive cast of characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe SOUND (10/10) of this show is just... flawless (swoon). Madhouse somehow just knows how to perfectly fit the background music to whichever scene comes up which in turn really made me feel the intensity/emotion every scene: whoever came up with the score deserves an award (if he's not already gotten one).\\n\\n\r\nAnd the sound effects give me the chills every time: the ball hitting the mitt with a resounding BAM! (or when Furuya throws it's more like thunder splitting open a tree), the sound of the metal bat hitting the ball (or when Raiichi hits it, more like canon fire) vs the sound of Haruichi's wooden bat hitting the ball, etc.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors did (and still do) an amazing job; their voices fit the characters perfectly. If you check out their impressive resumes, it's definitely no wonder.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the OPs and ED's:\\n\r\nBoth OP's so far are by the same artist, and they're really good (and revved me right up); though I'm enjoying the 2nd OP more; I can't help but shout \"Fight!\" as well every time I hear it, putting me in Seidou-cheering mood.\\n\r\nThe ED's have also been good, though not as good as the OP's. The 4th ED, which is sung collectively by 3 of the 4 main cast members, is a really nice tune.\\n\\n\r\nThe CHARACTERS (10/10) are all loveable and memorable. Though we have the main cast consisting of 4 people, the supporting cast is nothing to sneeze at.\\n\\n\r\nSawamura is the loud, cheerful, wears his heart on his sleeve kind of guy. So what kind of quirk does he have that makes him the MC? He's a southpaw (left-handed) pitcher and has a peculiar pitch (both of which make him a unique type of player). But, even though he's unique he isn't the type of MC that's super-talented right from the start, he doesn't suddenly \"power up\" in the middle of a game, is unstoppable and wins all the matches; on the contrary, he gets into Seidou and quickly realises it's not as easy as he thought to become the ace because there are other people there who are more skilled than him. He falters during important moments, and even if he doesn't get back up immediately, he does eventually pick himself up and learns to move on. In other words, he accepts that he has a lot of faults, and this is what makes him so likeable and seem more human. Though a bit of an idiot (well, a big idiot), he works hard, values friendship, supports the team and always puts 120% in everything that he does. And the best part for me, he's unpredictable. Just when you think he's turning the corner and well on his way to becoming the ace, he messes up a play or does something really silly. I'm always on edge with him.\\n\\n\r\nMiyuki, the genius catcher, is personality-wise, almost the exact opposite of Sawamura, except for the cheerful part. He's as crafty and intelligent as they come and though on the outside he's always smiling, he has a bit of a dark side. He's like the evil genius.\\n\\n\r\nFuruya is our MC's rival for the ace spot. At first glance, he looks like the cool and collected type of person, also; but after a while I found him to be an adorable idiot as well: not being able to catch a simple throw and his insta-snooze reaction amongst others.\\n\\n\r\nLast but not least of our main cast quartet, is Haruichi. Character-design wise, he's the cutest one. And though he might be cute, he's one amazing baseball player: not only is he a batting prodigy, but an exceptional fielder as well. At the same time, he's so humble and shy. Cuteness overload!\\n\\n\r\nAnd then we have the other Seidou members, who all play an important role in the show. All have distinctive and quirky personalties and you will grow attached to at least one after watching DnA.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as enjoyment (10/10) goes, I am thoroughly enjoying watching every second of DnA. Whenever I watch it, i can always expect a good dose of humour interlaced with the appropriate amount of emotional moments and also a killer cliff-hanger. I wait eagerly for Saturdays to roll around and every time I finish watching the latest episode, I want to jump out the window because it's going to take another week before I can watch the show again.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9.6/10) I would recommend anyone to start watching DnA immediately, even if you've never seen a baseball match before, even if you know absolutely nothing about the game (but after watching the show, I got so curious I even googled basic baseball rules, pitch types and the structure of Japanese high school baseball tournaments). And I envy you if you haven't watched it yet, because you'll be able to marathon the show, so you don't have to get as frustrated as me with those cliffhangers. :)",

            "content": "Diamond no Ace isn't completed at the time of this review, but I wanted to write a positive review on the anime so maybe more people would watch it. Diamond no Ace is one of the most enjoyable anime I've ever seen. Of course you must be wondering how watching an anime about baseball could possibly be so enjoyable. I'm not much of a baseball fan or sports fan for that matter myself, but Diamond no Ace succeeds in drawing the viewers into all the excitement of the sport with all it's dramatized action. \r\nThe story isn't anything unique or original. The plot is basicallythe same as any other sports anime: the main character, who starts off with almost nothing, journeys to become a great player who eventually wins the trust of his teammates and fights to win a championship. Of course along the way he must endure and go through lots of hardships, obstacles and as hard as it may be, develop friendships with his other teammates. That main character in Diamond no Ace's story would be Eijun Sawamura, a pitcher who attends Seido, an elite baseball school. Eijun is a hard-working, determined boy who used to play baseball because he wanted to have fun with his friends, but as the plot develops, he plays baseball in order to become the ace pitcher of his school's team, and become a winner. To add onto the sports aspect of the anime, the plot also takes place in school for a lot of times (some real comedy relief from the seriousness of the baseball matches). The development of friendship between teammates/friends, and rivalries between opponents were masterfully done. The suspense build-up and excitement in the baseball matches were quite shocking to me, because I didn't expect baseball to seem so epic and entertaining. \\n\\n\r\nPersonally I think that the biggest strength of Diamond no Ace is the variety of interesting characters and how much time is being spent developing the characters aside from the main character, Eijun Sawamura. Eijun, despite being the focal point of the plot, almost feels like a vessel through which the viewer can see and interact with the other side characters. Because the sport of baseball makes it necessary for a lot of characters, there are a lot of characters. But almost none of the side characters are shown just for a gimpse in an episode, then to be found nowhere the next episode. All the characters have some kind of development and unique trait to them that makes them all memorable. I could discuss in detail about 10 other characters in the anime, but since that'd take too long, I'll mention just one other character: Satoru Furuya, who is Eijun's rival for the \"Ace Pitcher\" spot on the team. He's very bad at communicating/getting along with other people, and is keeps to himself for the most part. It's revealed in his past that he never got along and was never accepted by his teammates, but on Seido, he finally does get acceptance by his teammates, leading him to show a tiny bit more emotion. His passion for baseball and determination matches that of Eijun, and so their rivalry for the ace pitcher position takes root, but they also seem to development a friendship and sort of respect/understanding for each other. Diamond no Ace's use of characters is easily a 10/10. \\n\\n\r\nThe music and art in the anime were definitely good. The openings for Diamond no Ace set the exciting tone to come in the anime. The other soundtracks used during the baseball matches managed to amplify the suspense in each moment. The sound of each hit was looouuuudd!! But that also added suspense. The art in the anime was very bright, colorful, and clear; the art that I like. The baseball matches were drawn to near perfection. The characters were all distinctively drawn. The voice acting was superbly done; it must have been hard for them to be yelling all the time. \\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment aspect of the anime was \"high\". Before watching this anime, I didn't expect much, I just watched it because it was on the recommendations list for Haikyuu, one of my favorite anime. But, I was to be surprised to say the least. Diamond no Ace switched around from school-life friendships to off the field issues, to the fantastic baseball matches, never failing to keep me interested. I'd tell all sports-lovers to watch Diamond no Ace, and I'd recommend anyone else to give Diamond no Ace a shot (maybe first 10 episodes), because it's definitely an anime worth giving a chance. Hehe, thanks for reading and I hope you do give Diamond no Ace a watch!",

            "content": "I have never written a review before, nor had I planned to. And I really dont care how un-review-like this review may be. I had to do it. I had to make an exception, just for this series, because I don not think that this series has got the credit or acknowledgement that is deserves. I will not go into detail about the story, the characters, sound or any of that (HOWEVER, I love the opening, story, characters and art.. such beautiful art...) \r\nAll I will say is this: This show is amazing.\r\nIts hilarious. Its intense. Its my favourite anime EVER. (and that's saying something)\r\nIhave not seen any other sports anime (apart from YowaPedal which is also currently airing), so I have nothing to compare this to. I have not read the manga either; I was going to, but this show is so damn god I cant bring myself to spoil the next part of the story.\\n\\n\r\nI have seen a lot of anime, but never have I responded to any like this. After watching the latest episode (13) I downloaded the series and have since watched all the episodes up until then again. I seriously cannot get enough of this show!\\n\\n\r\nI feel so inspired by the main protagonist, Eijun Sawamura; he knows he is not the best, and very far from it. He does not know his potential and does not understand his true talent- which really stands out in this story. Us as viewers know he has it, and he has to become aware of it himself. He has an unwavering dream of becoming the best, the ace of the team, and is simply inspiring. I find it hard to describe, but if you watch the show, you are sure to understand. Though some may seem bothered by his personality, I love it. He is comical when he needs to be, but also serious and has unmatched trust and devotion to his teammates. Each character is individual and different, and it is hard not to like any of them.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the story goes, many people have dropped it because of the slow start- it currently has an unknown number of episodes and the manga is still ongoing, so it is likely to be a longer running anime. However, after episode 10, things start getting more intense, and episode 13 was absolutely perfect.\\n\\n\r\nIf you have spare time on your hands, go watch this. if you don't, go watch it anyway. If you think you don't like baseball (like me), watch it. I don't care. I think I'm becoming a baseball fan just because of this anime. I LIVE for my Sundays now, as soon as the latest episode is released, I drop everything to watch it\\n\\n\r\nI went into this anime not expecting much (not being a fan of baseball), and came out with it being my favourite anime of all time. This may not be everyone's cup of tea, but if even one person gets as much enjoyment and excitement out of this anime as I did, then my job is as good as done. So why are you still here? Go watch it!",

            "content": "DnA is probably one of the best sports anime that I've come across yet. Although hailing from a country where Baseball is scarce, this started out to be a pretty interesting anime. It begins with an aspiring young pitcher named Eijun Sawamura, who throws a wild ball which flies over the catcher giving him no chance to seize it. This happens to grab the attention of a particular woman who turns out to be a scout for the baseball team of the highly popular school named Seido. Hence unfolding the journey which awaited Eijun in his future. \r\nWhat really got me into this at firstwas the soundtrack which had a pretty intimidating atmosphere. Even when I first heard the opening, \"Go EXCEED!!\", I was really fascinated by it and knew it was special. Same goes for the other two openings which approach as the show progresses. The endings were pretty fine too but average compared to the opening themes. \\n\\n\r\nAll the characters are pretty neatly drawn but there were some flaws too as most of the players in the team who rarely got featured were very dull to look at. \\n\\n\r\nI would gladly recommend Diamond no Ace to anyone who is into sports anime's. \\n\r\nThere is a second season coming out and I have high expectations for it.\\n",

            "content": "The one thing I felt missing from Major as much as I loved it, was how little of it was focused on high school baseball. \r\nDiamond no Ace, or Ace of the Diamond, differs from this and is quite strongly focused on high school baseball, and true to it's name focuses on finding the 'Ace' of the team; the pitcher that will bring the team to victory. \r\nBefore I go on I should mention the image you get of Sawamura from the first 2 episodes differs quite a little from how he ends up during the rest of the series. Think 'Small Town Hero, BigCity Zero.' :P\\n\\n\r\nThis isn't an anime about a kid with outstanding talent, it's about a boy who finds himself realising that the world of high school baseball is much bigger than he knew. Having been the star of his 'makeshift' middle school team he is thrown in the deep end when he encounters people with more obvious talents than himself.\\n\\n\r\nYes, he's got potential and yes there's the regular 'train to get stronger' theme that fits in perfectly within a sports setting. He has rivals within his own team, and due to his peculiar way of pitching* he has to prove himself to the large number of students also eager to make the starter team for Koushien. \\n\\n\r\nDnA has a great storyline, original perhaps not, but the relationships between the teammates, the 'senpai-kouhai' dynamics and the hands-on coaching, gives DnA its own flavour, not to mention it has no shortage of hilarious moments. Despite how slowly it starts off concentrating mainly on training, the 'real' matches begin and you will no doubt be rooting for this 'always out of reach' team to win, win and win in face of the unexpected adversity they encounter.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for romance you won't find any here, it's all about baseball, (and Sawamura being a fool). If you want something where the protagonist 'wins' all the time, then you're out of luck. If you want something where the main character is a diamond in the rough however, this is your thing. (Him and his peers).\\n\\n\r\nI don't like the pacing of the anime, but I could be biased having read the manga already. It's a bit too stretched out for my liking, which I think in an anime that doesn't carry the same buzz as Major did is a mistake. The voice acting is really on key, the characters all suit their voices, especially lil' old Harucchi who is my favourite character. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation aspect of it is slightly lacking, since it is a sports anime it should have a little more 'excitement' to it. \\n\\n\r\nPersonally I love it, you can relate to the MC, well at least I can. He struggles on whilst faced with the reality he is not the best, and it works well for him. I just hope other people like it too, because it gets much better, and since it's a very long-running series there is much more to it than what just one season will provide us with. Though even then it is still a really entertaining show to watch with plenty of good moments to keep you interested. \\n\\n\r\n*Sawamura does NOT have the same pitching style as Gorou-Major, his rival's pitching style is more similar to Gorou's. Sawamura's... well you just have to watch it and realise he is his own breed of awesome. :)\\n\\n\\n",

The story follows him and the Seidou team as he trains and practices to become the ace pitcher of the team and they try to restore Seidou to its former glory after it\u2019s 6 year absence from the Koushien championship.\r\n[Characters]:\r\nAs is the case with many sports shows, Diamond no Ace has an impressively large cast of characters and so I will address the cast mostly as awhole entity with some focus on the most primary characters.\\n\\n\r\nDespite there being multiple characters, such as Furuya Satoru and Miyuki Kazuya, who also recieve a good deal of the narrative spotlight, I think that Eijun is the indisputable protagonist and the show concerns itself first and foremost with his experiences at Seidou. With this being the case, I think one\u2019s enjoyment of the show can be either amplified or hampered by their level of enjoyment of Eijun though there are plenty of other characters who they might attach themselves to. He is strong-willed, boisterous, and at times obnoxious in his often overenthusiastic approach to things. He is extremely motivated towards reaching his goal of becoming the ace pitcher for the team as well as winning the summer tournament and attending Nationals. While Eijun has a few skills to start out with, his knowledge of pitching and of the sport is mediocre and so his learning as a first-year doubles as character progression for him and explanatory insight into the strategy of the game for the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nAlong with Eijun there are a few other first-year characters (and one second-year) who show notable growth throughout the series. Furuya Satoru is a highly talented pitcher who often acts as Eijun\u2019s rival on the team, Kominato Haruichi is the skilled younger sibling of one of the third-year students, and Miyuki Kazuya is an all-star catcher who enjoys manipulating and reigning in his unruly pitchers. The Seidou school accepts a great many skilled players however the most important of them belong to the First-String \u2013 primarily the third-year players and those skilled enough to win tournament games (the top 20 players for the summer tournament). While these people are the most often featured throughout the show as they play in all of the important games, they are a little slow to be explored initially and not every player is as memorable as the next even on the main team.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters not part of the main team, because it is impossible to present an entire team that is foreign to the audience with the same level of intrigue as the main cast, the opposing teams most often feature between 2 and 3 characters of note \u2013 one usually with slightly more backstory or context than the others. In this way, the teams themselves are not very memorable however they can be identified easily enough by means of their noteworthy player(s). These characters are usually interesting enough however I found that a good deal of the opponents were not as memorable as I might have wished with the exception of a select few. Overall, the method used here is both sufficient and necessary and certain viewers may gravitate in interest towards one interesting player or another.\\n\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]:\\n\\n\r\nI found the art and animation to be highly consistent throughout the show despite its 75-episode length and at no point did I find there was a notable drop in quality. The character designs are pretty subdued as the show comes off as fairly realistic in its approach and so the players look normal while each appearing different enough to be distinguishable from one another. I myself was felt underwhelmed with the art style if only in that it felt like a pretty standard approach to things and didn\u2019t feature anything particularly adventurous however it works perfectly well for what it tries to do and I have no actual qualms with the designs or animation. It was well done however was not done so in such a way that I would actively list it as a strength of the show. In the same vein of the unadventurous approach, I thought that the comedic scenes and comical faces and animations were pretty run of the mill and I didn\u2019t think any gag save maybe 2 really did much for me throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nOne of my biggest gripes with the show appears in this category and that is its rampant overuse of the \u2018white background\u2019 effect. In moments of intensity or drama, it can be visually helpful to have the scenery and setting fall away in place of the character\u2019s reaction or realization and add to the emotion or excitement of the moment however in the case of Diamond no Ace I found it made such excessive use of this technique that it felt exhausted after just a handful of episodes. There are plenty of cases within the show where it uses the white background successfully however with its appearance 4 to 5 times an episode for 75 episodes, its usage firstly comes off as a bit boring and secondly somewhat tarnishes what could have otherwise be well executed uses of the technique in later scenes. What I want for the show in the future is for it to allow the scenes and sentiments stand on their own from time to time while avoiding the usage of a potentially good concept.\\n\\n\r\n[Story]:\\n\\n\r\nThe show starts a little slow as it introduces us to Eijun and subsequently the structure of Seidou High. While this pacing is retrospectively not an issue within the context of its 75-episode length, it is quite slow by other standards. I felt it took nearly 20 episodes to start rolling which can be quite demanding if someone is trying to get into the show. The show has a good deal of drama however I thought that at least the early episodes came off as a little melodramatic whereas the later parts of the show address more interesting and legitimate problems and dilemmas.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing of the games was actually quite an interesting element of the show. At times the games would start off with the first at bat and play out for a good while from there however there were plenty of instances where the show would launch into a prospective game after a couple innings. I found this allowed the games to focus around the compelling parts of the game while avoiding perhaps some of the more typical moments. It also allowed for the show to setup certain situations without having to spend time prefacing itself \u2013 the game could start with 2 runners on base and a full count and you are immediately brought into the excitement of the moment. The end of the games were also sometimes subject to this approach in that, after resolving the key drama of the game or watching a major game-changing play, the game would end as expected and it would skip ahead to the celebration or the aftermath. Overall, I found this kept things fresh and cut out things that otherwise may have seemed grating and so this narrative technique I found to be a strong point within the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is, to a degree, pitcher-centric which is somewhat to be expected given the main character\u2019s vocation and the way baseball is played \u2013 it simply wouldn\u2019t be as interesting if it focused on left field or the shortstop. Because of this necessary focus, we spend a good deal of time, especially in the early half of the show, with the pitchers of the Seidou team. They each have their own unique style; for instance Eijun is known for his unwieldy and aggressive but hard-to-hit pitches whereas Furuya throws an incredible fastball. The show features good progression in the way of their pitching styles and approaches however because each pitcher has a lot of ground to cover, the pitching styles start off rather stark and simple. This can be problematic in the first half of the show because the lack of a dynamic strategy within the main focus of the games can come off as a little boring and it takes a while before things start to mix up.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, because the show takes a long time to get moving and must introduce a lot of different players on the main team, the highlighting of the opposing players starts off a little lackluster whereas the show gets much better at presenting these characters as the show progresses. As Seidou faces tougher and tougher teams in either tournament games or scrimmages, the number of interesting opponents on any one team gradually grows slightly which I felt helped the opposing teams seem more formidable. The progression from one team with a single outstanding player towards one with multiple was an interesting way to evolve the gameplay without making certain players seem unnaturally good or other teams much worse than they were \u2013 each team feels like a legitimate challenge at some level.\\n\\n\r\n[Music]:\\n\\n\r\nThe music is good enough however I felt it was almost non-present in the early episodes of the show as far as impact is concerned \u2013 it was discernible but dialed back. The music was decent when it came around however it didn\u2019t blow me away with its appearance despite adding to the scenes successfully. As the show progresses into the later half of the episodes I found that there were maybe 2 to 3 recognizable songs that would play repeatedly in accordance with the big action scenes or dramatic moments. They worked well however I felt the show was somewhat lacking diversity in this area and I would have liked a few more songs of note to have appeared in this same manner and with similar levels of execution.\\n\\n\r\n[Final Thoughts and Rating]: \\n\\n\r\nDiamond no Ace is a show that accomplishes what it sets out to do. It does baseball well and the characters and plays are appealing enough that one can easily find themselves interested in the outcome of things. Some areas where the show loses some points for me are the sometimes obnoxious nature of the protagonist, the somewhat uninspired art approach, the overuse of certain dramatic visuals, and the slow to start pacing of the show. I also felt that the comedy was pretty lacking despite its frequent presence in each episode. It came off as very bland both in terms of the gags and the character reactions and really didn\u2019t further my enjoyment of the show in any way.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 7\\n\\n\r\nI gave the show a 7 because, either by way of its high points or its consistent appeal, the show was enjoyable. It falls short in a few regards as discussed above and many of those things are fairly subjective to me and so it\u2019s perfectly reasonable that anyone who finds themselves more engrossed in either the main character or the beginning of the show will enjoy the show a good deal more as it only gets better as it continues.\\n\\n\r\n[Recommendations]:\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend Diamond no Ace to any sports fan as I think it does the genre well. The show has good dramatic moments that usually come with the territory of sports and so I would recommend it for that reason as well. Those interested in inter-team rivalry would do well to watch as there is a fair amount of competition in this regard which is not something I see in every sports show.",

The story starts off with our main character Sawamura Eijun, he loves baseball and has a goal of going to nationals with his group of friends. After losing a game, one day Sawamura gets called downstairs to find out he has been invited to Seido High School, which is apparently famous for its strong baseball team. At first Sawamura declines the offer because of his friends but visitingthe school and meeting a few, lets say, interesting characters, changes his mind and soon after he starts his journey to become the ace of Seido baseball team. \\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10) \\n\r\nI saw no real problem with the art in this anime, actually its really well done. It is consistent and never drops in quality.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10)\\n\r\nSo far all of the OPs and EDs have been good, I didn't feel the urge to skip them, in fact I find myself enjoying listening to and watching them. The background music is also very good, it helps set the sometimes tense and sometimes exciting atmosphere in each and every game. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9/10)\\n\r\nI love all of the characters so far, and there is a lot of them, but each and every one is different in their own way. Its interesting to see some of the characters stray away from the generic characters you usually find in sports/shounen animes. I also like that you get to know a lot about the supporting characters instead of just focusing on the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10)\\n\r\nDiamond no Ace is an extremely enjoyable anime, it has the ability to make you laugh but can also get you on the edge of your seat in some of the intense moments, it had me watching episode after episode and once i had got up to date i almost wished there were another 45 episodes so i could keep going.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10)\\n\r\nSo far Diamond no Ace has been an exciting anime that will easily have you hooked. The animation is very well done, the soundtrack is fitting and the characters are outstanding. This is definitely an anime worth watching!",

            "content": "NOTE - Do NOT be fooled by the first few episodes or the sport. This is pretty much the Hunter x Hunter 2011 of Shounen sports anime. Starts off typical and ends up something completely different.\r\nStory - 10/10\r\nThe story is for me split into 2 parts. The first part (episodes 1-20) is used to introduce the characters, the game and the world of this anime. It does so by relying on cliche's. Its the weakest part of the series.\r\nThe second part is episode 20 onwards. This is where the writers talent really shines. After going through all the cliche's most of the setup is donefor the main teams and we enter our first major arc. This arc is only a taste of what's to come, it has everything. The series becomes much more strategic, much more tense, much more emotional, much faster paced, and much much more unpredictable. \\n\r\nThe writing is exceptional in every regard. From tone shifts, to little bits of foreshadowing, everything is perfectly written. Its one of the few anime that even after a major shift in the story which completely changes the series and characters forever, it still manages to impress me in all the ways it previously had. \\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation - 9.5/10\\n\r\nFor a 75 episode series the art and animation is absolutely breathtaking. Its no surprise knowing that this is done by the two leading studios in the industry, Madhouse (HxH2011) and Production I.G. (Kuroko no Basket, Haikyuu, Attack on Titan). Take the beautiful art of Hunter x Hunter 2011's Chimera Ant arc and merge with the fluidity and intensity of Haikyuu and that's the art and animation in a nutshell. Its done in a way that the slow sport of baseball ends up being much more intense than a basketball match from Kuroko No Basket. It's beautifully done. Only major flaw is that some episodes, especially when the studios have new anime starting at the same time, tend to have simplified art, but it is still acceptable as they are in the minority.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10/10\\n\r\nThe music of this series is phenominal. The ost sounds very similar to that of a work by Hiroyuki Sawano, consisting of guitar solo's, rock instruments, large orchestrations and even a cover of a song from Micheal Bay's Transformers! (which far outdo's the original)\\n\r\nThe opening's and ending's are especially note worthy. In particular those done by GLAY and the band consisting of the composer and co-composer called OxT (you may know them from Overlord's opening)\\n\r\nI'd also like to take a moment to talk about the voice actors. HOLY S H I T! (excuse my language) There talent is amazing. It's so obvious that they are pouring there heart and soul into this and the ending themes they themselves create are some of the best ending themes of there year. (Final Victory by the Voice Actor of our main character is easily my ending theme of last year)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - I've already watched the anime 5 times in the past 4 months.... its saddening I can't give it more. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10/10\\n\r\nWith absolutely phenomenal writing that has the ability the grab your heart and stomp it almost every episode, either through heart breaking scenes that are expertly animated and directed, or moments of hope when your heart is jumping with joy at the pleasure of having this experience, this is an anime that is beautifully directed, flawlessly paced, phenomenally written, flawlessly composed and beautifully animated, this is easily in my opinion the greatest sports anime of all time, and easily one of the greatest anime of all time.\\n\\n\r\nPeople who think it will be useless and boring because its about baseball let me leave you with this....\\n\r\nMADHOUSE X PRODUCTION I.G. X UFOTABLE",

            "content": "This review may be biased as baseball is definitely not my cup of tea, but comparatively to other sports and specifically baseball animes I've seen, this one is near the bottom. Nevertheless, Diamond no Ace does it's job well- it stuck to it's focus on baseball, developed a strong cast of likable characters, made every game exciting, and for the most part followed a reasonable plot. If you're looking for an anime entirely dedicated to baseball, this is it. \r\nMy 5 rating is very harsh considering this show does a lot of things well, notably establishing one of the most enjoyable, unique, and vast castof characters. But for a show that is entirely dependent on it's hype, I lost interest too frequently. \\n\\n\r\nConsidering the sheer length of this show, not much happens. Our MC Eijun is scouted for a prestigious baseball school, assimilates to the baseball club, and goes through a tournament. This could theoretically fit 75 episodes with extensive background development of side characters, episode-long training montages, school life, maybe even romance- but that just doesn't happen. The tournament starts at around episode 20, meaning this is a 55 episode tournament arc- it's inherently too long. And yet the show focuses on nothing but the tournament for the following 50 episodes. This means each game becomes progressively longer to fill the inevitable empty space, and that entails constant flashbacks & mundane camera angels between every. single. pitch. I am not exaggerating when saying most flashbacks (which are plentiful) play up to 10 times throughout the tournament arc; the games became awfully slow- painfully slow. \\n\\n\r\nAnd while this is very common in shounen, this one really pushes the boundaries. While overusing cliche flashbacks and showcasing the dugout and crowd every 30 seconds, the dramatization never ends which turns itself dull. Yelling is initially exciting, but at some point it becomes too much, unfortunately, that's the case here. With most games lasting 9 innings, the intelligent-based cast are bestowed closeup screen-time to let the audience know something important is finally about to happen. But the further the tournament progresses they start proclaiming every single inning as the turning point; They start crying wolf. The anime's pattern in general became very predictable, and I ended up skimming through the end due to lack of interest. \\n\\n\r\nLastly the plot is very odd, and personally not to my liking. When following a shounen MC I'm expecting him to be the best. Not from the get go, but he needs to prove his promise. And while Eijun is given immeasurable chances to do so, he seems to always fail when it matters- not once, always. And considering his teammate rival Furuya is outright superior in every sense, seeing Eijun failing again and again and yet still getting supported becomes discouraging. He is in the 1st-string of one of the best baseball schools by sole virtue of his lucky and unique pitching form, and he never pulls through. Either make him struggle more before he makes it or have him be useful. People, even in fiction, don't get this much back patting. His character design is good, its a waste to have him stubbornly cling to his weaknesses. His existence in the team doesn't really make sense, might as well have Furuya as the MC, he gets to play nearly twice as much as Eijun. \\n\\n\r\nThe Characters, art, and sound all range from 7-10, but the story and dependent hype enjoyment just doesn't hold up. If you're looking for either a baseball or sport anime, there is better out there. But if you truly love baseball animes, the cast, don't mind hours of ideal time, and already watched the better shows, this isn't the worst of them either.",

This is a kind of anime which makes you watch for more after each episode. This anime does character development superbly.\r\nStory 9\r\nThe story of this anime is well written. IT shows all the aspect of main character life as well as gives enough story of side characters. It knows the perfect timing of telling the story of character and makes sure that person watching it doesn't get bored. Even though the story is well written the episodes in the series feela bit stretched. In the end the story feels good if you watch it in whole completed series, and beware that series doesn't have the main ending instead it stretch out to second season.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8\\n\r\nThe art in this anime is pretty good. I also can't say that it is too good counting that it is a newer series. The art is good enough that it is not worse like 'ping pong' nor it is as good as 'free'. In the end art is well fitting for the anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9\\n\r\n This anime is one of the best baseball anime which only focuses on the sports rather than making a romance out of it. This anime in my opinion very much in top five best sports anime. In the end, Diamond no ace is a treat to watch and a fabulous anime.",

            "content": "This anime is not yet completed but I am up-to-date in the episodes and have watched every single episode that is out so far. I wanted to give this anime a review however of what I've seen so far. I watched a couple of sports anime before I started watching this anime but I never had seen a baseball one before. This anime did not disappoint. The reasons why is not because the characters \"love the sport\". In every sports anime a character has to love the sport in order for it to even be considered a sports anime. No, the reason that I foundthis anime very intriguing is because of the characters. Never have I ever been so in love and involved with characters from an anime before. I mean I've seen a lot of sports animes and this anime's storyline is no different from the rest but man the characters are really what keeps you watching this anime.\\n\\n\r\nSawamura Eijun, is an open book, loud and very oboxious and like basically what everyone calls him in the anime he is a complete and utter idiot when it comes to baseball. That is why he is so lovable. He is a character you want to root for and you want to succeed. It is because he isn't amazing at the sport that makes the character really relatable. He becomes real. When Eijun is learning about the sport those of us who don't know the sport are learning as well. So in that sense Eijun is essentially the \"viewer\". You make think that sound crazy but I believe when watching this anime it literally feels like you become the characters. I easily found myself in every character because each character all have one aspect that is purely \"their  character\" if that makes any sense haha. I could go in full detail on every main character in this anime but that would just take too much time. However, I will point out a few characters watch out for.\\n\\n\r\nMiyuki Kazuya, is the essential catcher of the first string team of Seidou. The character is very essential in bringing out Eijun's potential. That is because he is the one who catching  Eijun's pitches. He has what the other characters of the anime say \"twisted personality\" but  despite that he is a truly amazing baseball player. He even was showcased in sports magazines in the anime. That is how skilled of a catcher he is.  His dynamic with Eijun is pretty amazing. Despite the fact that Eijun doesn't respect him (because of his twisted personality) like he does with his other sempais, Miyuki is someone that Eijun needs to become a better pitcher and grow into a better baseball player.\\n\\n\r\nFuruya Satoru is literally and emotionless character. He literally always have a blank face unless he feel faint or two he feels really furious. He is an amazing fastball pitcher and is more skilled that Eijun is in regards to pitching which makes him Eijun's rival in becoming the \"ace of the diamond\".\\n\\n\r\nKominato Haruichi is another essential character in this anime. He hasn't gotten much story so far in the anime but the fact that he has to live up to his older brother Kominato Ryousuke makes his story so appealing as well. There are so many other characters that I can explain but these are the main ones that you really follow throughout the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe rivalry between Seidou and Inashiro is the true driving force of this anime. Every episode is leading up to this \"Final Game\" that decides which team gets to go to Nationals. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I truly enjoyed about this anime is that every game shown you see a character grow or break. Each game something happens that pulls you into the game and make you root for Seidou. What is also amazing is that Seidou truly is a team just like how Sohoku is truly a team in Kuroko No Basuke.  The players of Seidou truly know how to work together and make such amazing plays that is just astounding. Sure the point of the anime is to find the true \"Ace\" of the team and I understand that the \"Ace\" is essential to the team since the \"Ace\" is the one that holds the team together during a game but because Seidou doesn't have a true \"Ace\" makes this anime really special. The whole anime follows specifically Sawamura Eijun a novice pitcher. He and the rest of the pitchers, Furuya, Kawakami and Tanba all fight for the \"Ace\" title. I have to admit that yes one these pitchers actually does get the \"Ace\" number but is he really a true ace? Even the coach doesn't really truly know that yet. \\n\\n\r\nPoint is that this anime really had me reeled in because of the characters and because the anime is still exploring on what a \"true ace of the diamond\" is. I won't stop watching this anime until the very end. Everyone who loves sports anime should really give this anime a shot. Even if you don't really like baseball you will find this anime very enjoyable. I never liked baseball but this gave me a new perspective of the sport and taught me so many things I never knew about the sport. It isn't just a sports anime where the characters have to win the championship or go to nationals no its a sports anime in which you have not only go to nationals but also figure out the true meaning of the title of the anime \"Ace of The Diamond\" and that's something other sports animes don't have. Something in which the main character wants to become. Other sports anime the team and main characters only want to become national champions and winners or become a \"true team\" but in this sports anime the main character wants to become the \"Ace of The Diamond\" and because the fact that the main character has the spirit but not the skills makes this show really worth watching.\\n",

            "content": "I was initially introduced to this show when through a comment on a show saying \"Man.. Ace of Diamond makes my Saturdays better.\" Having no expectations for this show, I decided to watch it because I had not else better to watch. I mean, let\u2019s be real\u2026 With Basketball, and Volleyball, and Soccer, and other sports, Baseball is obviously not the most exciting sport to watch. But man, was I wrong.The first click to episode 1 landed me to episode 13. Marathoning all the airing episodes, I was so excited and couldn't focus on any other anime or school work, or sleep or anything atall. \\n\\n\r\nThe art, story, sound and character are elements that help make this anime shine;but the one element that distinguish this anime from a diamond and a mere crystal are the characters. At first impression, Eijun Sawamura may only appear to be a  a silly boy with a talent for baseball; however, that is not all this anime presents. Sawamura is carefree but not lazy, rowdy but still serious, simple but not brainless. Even though this is a show that is shown on a screen, each and every one of the character traits are delivered appropriately. As if the characters were flesh and blood, you could see their disappointment, cheer them on their success and laugh with them on their mistakes.Sure, you can watch an anime and know which character is an idiot or an intellect,talented or not,but, very rarely, would there be an instant where you could watch an anime and actually know about the characters as if they were your best friend. All the characters such as Sawamura, Furuya, Ryousuke, Yuki and  his teammates and their rivals are created and developed splendidly.To be honest, this was one of the few anime where I remember most of the names of the characters. I mean I don't even remember what I wore yesterday or what my breakfast was, so imagine how I managed to remember 50 characters in a show..\\n\\n\r\nWhile the story may seem to follow the typical sports anime route, the most important aspect about the story is the message it delivers:\"Not everyone is good at first.\" \"Practice makes permanent.\" The best feature of this anime is that it motivates individuals to strive to improve and practice. Whether it be baseball, soccer, studying, piano, it is not talent that is the deciding factor, but ultimately, it is effort that counts.\\n\\n\r\n Along with the character and beautiful art, the soundtrack is gear that pumps motivation and excitement in the anime. I been waiting for 50 episodes for the soundtrack to get released and now it's finally out!! Not to sound crazy or anything,but I listen to the soundtrack to get inspired and find motivation to study and it works!\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I found this anime by surprise, and I can say I'm never so glad I didn't overlook it. This anime is a long adventure, but I can ensure you, it's not a boring one.  Throwing in interesting characters, humor, art and  amazing soundtracks, the producers have churned out an amazing sport anime. Whether you want to kill time, ease away your sadness, or look for motivation. This is the right sport anime for you. \\n",

            "content": "TLDR Review: \r\n     I don\u2019t exactly enjoy the idea of rating something before it\u2019s over but after 59 episodes I think I've gotten the gist of the show. From the standpoint of someone who has been around and played baseball since I was able to walk, Diamond no Ace is a show that gets baseball right. DnA is by no means a perfect show but in terms of understanding the sport of baseball and developing the characters as a result, it hits the nail on the head. So if you are looking for a realistic baseball anime then DnA should beon your very short plan-to-watch list. \\n\\n\r\nIn Depth Review: \\n\r\n    For me, personally, I've found shows that exceed the 20-30 episode mark are hard to get into. Though I never felt that while watching DnA, now whether that was because of my ability to relate to the characters and the situations or not could be left up for interpretation. DnA is simply the anime adaptation of the DnA manga that has been published since 2006 and is still publishing. The current show is being animated primarily by Production I.G. with help from Madhouse. The show begins with a practically hopeless pitcher by the name of Eijun Sawamura who has a couple tricks up his sleeve. Eijun is scouted during a game with his middle school team and ends up getting an offer to play baseball with one of the most renowned baseball high schools in all of Tokyo: Seido. The story picks up from there on, so for the sake of not spoiling anything major I will not say any more. With that aside lets begin with the actual review. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10 \\n\r\n    The story itself is not anything special, it follows your regular routine in a shonen similar to that of Naruto. Where the main protagonist is not reliable in the slightest but has the will and determination to get better, However the story begins to take a bit of a turn after the initial arc. The story turns more into the team itself instead of what the main character can accomplish and that in itself turns into one of the story\u2019s strong points. Granted that the story is a bit generic but you can\u2019t exactly expect much in that aspect from a light-hearted sports anime, what the show does it does to the best of its abilities. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10 \\n\r\n     The characters are one of, if not the strongest point of this show. As I said previously the show turns into more of the team and form that you don\u2019t just feel for one of the characters but everyone as a whole. You physically want them to win against every team they play against, following every player and hoping that they can do their part in sealing the win for the team. Characters are certainly something that this show did right and I feel other shows could learn from it.  \\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10 \\n\r\n     Unfortunately the art and animation suffer a bit because of the sheer length of the show. You can\u2019t exactly ask for gorgeous fight scenes, well in this case batting or fielding scenes. Mainly due to the fact that the animation studios simply do not have the money to invest into a 60+ episode series. I won\u2019t harp on the art for too long but they do again use it to the best of their abilities which is by no means a bad thing. All in all the art is not bad, it\u2019s just very mediocre from their excessive use of still frames and such. \\n\\n\r\nMusic/Sound Design: 7/10 \\n\r\n       In terms of sound and music design there really isn't much to choose from aside from the sounds of dialogue and baseballs being hit and caught. With the occasional hype music to keep you in tune with the scene. Aside from those sounds, which do in fact sound accurate, I can\u2019t REALLY rate this. So from that I just went with my go to rating, really nothing more to say about this. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10 \\n\r\n       Now I don\u2019t particularly like to rate things subjectively but because this one hit home (no pun intended) for me this is MY opinion on the show. It really reminded me of some of the things that baseball was to me, whether remembering these things are a bad thing or not I have yet to find out. The show suffers from small things such as many still frames and mediocre animation but that is not what makes this show great. The teamwork of everyone, the build-up of every antagonist and every game, giving characters that need a back-story one. Everything about this show just fits for what it is. Sports anime can be particularly hard to get into, especially if you don\u2019t understand many of the complex rules of the game such as baseball. However this show is by no means hard to get into and if you\u2019re looking for a longer sports show, give it a try. \\n",

            "content": "Yes, I know that that number of episodes are intimidating, but this anime is truly one of the greatest sports anime I have seen up to date. I normally do not like to watch sport animes, but after convincing myself to keep an open mind, I tried this anime out. And now i am simply hooked. I would like to say beforehand that this anime is not yet completed, everything in here is my own opinion, and that I definitely give this an a solid 10/10\r\nThe storyline is rather simple, but just to sum it up in a few words; Sawamura is a country boywho loves baseball, and gets scouted for Seido High School's baseball team in the city. A simple baseball anime but the way the story is played out is amazing! The character interactions and the  tournaments are very well developed and invigorating. The beginning starts off rather slow but intriguing enough to continue. However once you reach deeper into the anime, you have seen these characters work so hard and bond so well for so long that to see them win or lose completely moves you to feel as they do. Also this anime is very realistic about how baseball is played, how teams do win and lose, and does not have any ridiculous-named moves/attacks.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style might be what turns you away but I find it okay and very unique. Its graphics and animation is not out-of-this-world amazing, but its good enough to keep you okay with it and continue the show. But I do think that the animation for the game scenes are done rather well. The slow-motion or the fast-pace combined with the music really gets you absorbed into the moment\\n\\n\r\nThe OSTs are also something to be praised. I wouldn't call the music original but it has character to it. The OSTs fit into their respective scenes and some of them even have the power to move you to feel energized or sad or even shocked. As mentioned above the music combined with the scene in the game really has an impact.\\n\\n\r\nA 10/10 for these characters are very very well developed, and absolutely none are hate-able. There is a huge cast of different teams and its amazing how the mangaka is able to make each and every one of them special and different. Right off form the bat, I was able to remember who was who and their special little quirks that make them so likable! It is a pleasure to watch these different characters learn how to trust each other and form a team based connected and strengthen by their individual special skills. Ace of Diamond really shows how important teamwork and trust is in baseball and also in life. \\n\r\nYou can really see the strong bonds between characters and that shows in their great display of teamwork. I greatly admire all of the teamwork and friendship that the characters display. They act cute and funny with each other, but right in the next moment, can act serious. Especially after watching these characters struggle to improve themselves through hours of long practice and learn how to trust each other, you get really attached to them. You even get attached to the opponents because of how great they fought to win. \\n\\n\r\nYes that was a very long paragraph for characters, so all you need to really know is that these characters are extremely likable, display great teamwork, and have the funniest to the most serious interactions with one other.\\n\\n\r\nWhether or not you like sports anime will determine if you like this anime, but it certainly doesn't hurt to give sport animes a shot.  Ace of Diamond is realistic, funny, suspenseful, and, for me at certain scenes, tear-jerking. I am rather glad that I opened myself because then i would have never been able to have the pleasure in watching Ace of Diamond.",

            "content": "Spoiler free review\r\n\"I'm here to become the ace!\" - Sawamura Eijun\r\nDiamond no Ace is an exhilarating ride - filled with emotion that is complimented by exciting action.\r\nStory: If one has seen a substantial amount of high school sports anime, one will quickly begin to see that Diamond no Ace follows the typical formula for a successful sports anime albeit with alterations. This makes certain plot elements less meaningful and predictable, however the execution of these elements is skillfully done in order to differ from other titles in its genre.\r\nOn the other hand, if one isn't well-versed in this genre, then congratulations the experience will beamplified by two fold. Plot elements will be original, consequently resulting in the emotional aspects of the plot to be more effective that really pound one's heart.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation: The art quality is fair, it is not the best one has seen nor is it the worst. However, for a series that boasts a 75 episode count, it certainly is impressive that the art quality never deteriorated into a horrible mess, a testament to the studio's skill and organisation. \\n\r\nWhat really shines in Diamond no Ace is the animation quality. This is evidently demonstrated when pitches are thrown, one can really feel the intensity, speed and power. This is also the case for batting, catching etc. This type of fluid animation aids to further immerse the viewer into the world of Diamond no Ace.  \\n\\n\r\nSound: It is difficult to describe sound in a written review. Nonetheless, the sound in Diamond no Ace, in my humble opinion, is the best aspect of the series. Receiving a great rating of 9. The soundtrack (excluding openings and endings) really accentuates the character's emotions, their determination, conviction etc. It transforms the baseball field into an epic battlefield unveiling the tense and epic atmosphere the characters are experiencing. The complimenting soundtrack was what enabled me to become a fan of baseball, it converts viewers who never had an interest in baseball to enthusiastically watch and cheer for the team they like best (Seidou for most of us).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Diamond no Ace has a plethora of characters. This results in a lot of mentor, supporting and rival characters for our main protagonist, Sawamura Eijun to learn and grow from. The bonds that each of these characters share with each other is another aspect in which Diamond no Ace excels at. As we observe the characters throughout each episode, it is evident that all of them slowly grow, adding more depth to the characters which further immerses the viewer into this fictional world creating a more personal link with the characters of the series. However, having too many characters can deteriorate the plot and thus the effectiveness of the series. Although, Diamond no Ace creates great bonds between its characters, some of them seem quite one dimensional, this is especially the case for some of the supporting characters (third years). Furthermore, the overabundance of rivals, existing in the same team, creates a frustrating conflict for the main character. At times, it seems the main antagonist is the rival not the opposing team.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7 - A good rating\\n\r\nThrough the combination of impressive animation, decent visuals, amazing sound and a fair plot, the final rating for (non spoiler) Diamond no Ace is a good rating of 7. Worth checking out if you are a fan of sports anime in general. However the limitations due to the character and plot sections prevent this anime from reaching a greater score of an 8 or a 9.          \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review :) below is spoiler filled comment/rant discussing the character and plot sections of this anime.\\n\\n\r\n~~~~~~spoiler comment alert~~~~~~\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nFor those of you who have watched the series, i am mainly talking about Furuya. His character was interesting at first, i believed that he was going to be another obstacle to Eijun's journey in becoming the ace - which was built up from episode 1 and obviously the title reflects that the plot is going to be centered on his journey in becoming the ace, ultimately leading his team to victory.\\n\r\nFrom episode 1, the audience is teased that our main protagonist was going to form an unstoppable battery with Miyuki - the genius catcher. But this was not the case, as even in the manga Sawamura is still a bench warmer, and at this rate it seems Miyuki is going to graduate before Sawamura ever dreams of becoming the ace. I would understand about 20-30 episodes of Sawamura becoming a bench warmer to Furuya, in order to train and build more character depth in order to return stronger. But unfortunately this was not the case. Even in season 2 of the anime (episode 22 as of this date) and the manga - Sawamura is still a bench warmer. It appears that Sawamura is turning into a support character for Furuya - his rival. He is seen cheering Furuya and motivating him to pitch well, when in reality the main protagonist Sawamura should be pitching as the ace. It is incomprehensible that the main protagonist is reduced to be part of a supporting cast, as Furuya begins to form a battery with Miyuki. After enduring 65 episodes of Sawamura bench warming for Furuya and Tanba (i can accept this), the mangaka wants us to endure another 100 episodes of Sawamura bench warming, and now even being part of Furuya's supporting cast. I have heard rumors that the mangaka did not originally intend for Sawamura to be the main protagonist but instead have Furuya to be the protagonist, but his editor wanted Sawamura to be the main protagonist due to his Naruto/shounen like personality (no source). Nevertheless, it almost seems that Sawamura is shoehorned into the series at this rate.\\n\\n\r\nI am not a shounen fan or a Sawamura lover etc. It is frustrating that the character we followed from episode 1 and the character we have the most emotional attachment with is reduced to nothing but a supporting cast. It would of been perfectly fine for Furuya to be the main protagonist if we just followed his journey from the start instead of Sawamura's, as his character is much more unique and fresh to the sports anime genre.\\n\r\nI am also not a lover of overpowered naruto type of plots either ( i dislike them) , but enduring 65 episodes of training (im sweet with this - was a great arc) then another 30 episodes of bench warming (k, its sweet as long as we see him grow and in the end see him as the ace forming a battery with Miuyki as teased), but then realizing that even in the manga he is still a bench warmer -.- that's going to be like 100 episodes of bench warming and possibly Miyuki graduating before even forming a battery together. k no thanks -.-\\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, a good sports anime series - there is no denying that.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I have caught up with the current ongoing manga so my thoughts on the anime has changed a little since reading it\r\nStory -6 : The story of this series is very typical shounen material so its something you would expect from most sports anime. Usually a sports series is good because of its characters anyways so thats all I will say for the story.\r\nArt -7: I liked the art, it doesn't try to be too flashy, and characters all have different designs so its easy to tell the difference. I think the anime does a decent job, especially when trying to portray the emotions ofcertain characters like when they feel frustrated the color of the backgrounds change with the emotions of the characters. I think the art of the manga is better though as the author is pretty good at drawing the faces of his characters, especially the eyes. Really brings out the intensity of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nSound -7: The sound was decent, although sometime the ost were repetitive, i enjoyed them. The sounds of the baseball bat hitting the ball is also repetitive but its not an issue for me. The openings were great and the endings were ok. The best part is for sure the voice acting. The VAs are so into their roles that they hold special events to do with this series and cosplay as the characters. There are even character songs of our favorite characters in the series which i recommend everyone to give a listen.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters -8: Now, like most sports anime this is the best part of a series . There are a lot of characters in this series and while not all of them are amazing, there are quite a few likable ones. Usually, the mc Sawamura eijun would be the main focus of the series. However, a lot of times the focus shifts to the Seido team as a whole. There are senpais in the series who are great supporting characters of the first years but they also have their own goals that they want to accomplish, to be a big contributor to the team. Seido baseball club is so lovable because of the interactions of all these characters as well as how they support one another or striving to improve themselves. \\n\\n\r\nYuki is the captain of the team so he has a lot of responsibility and usually gives his teammates encouragement. The most important characters to the mc are Miyuki the catcher and Chris the other catcher. Chris is the main support of Sawamura and is a big part of his development as a character. Chris himself was struggling because of an injury and this was also one of the reason why Sawamura developed. These characters support one another but are also self motivated.\\n\\n\r\nMiyuki, the main catcher of the team is sometimes the core of the team because he is the one who takes care of all the catchers. He has a carefree attitude and his teammates get pissed off because of him sometimes but they respect him a lot. Like Chris, his relationship with Sawamura is amazing and you get to see it from a realistic perspective. Miyuki's relationship with Sawamura is one of the best dynamics in the series. \\n\\n\r\nThe backstory of the characters are simple to understand, and although the series is never deep, its executed in a realistic way. Sawamura is still the main character and got the most development. He was a typical shounen mc at first but his characters development is done in the most realistic way possible. Many people complain that he gets overshadowed by his rival Furuya and doesn't get enough screen time but for me that was why I liked Sawamura even more. He struggled a lot and being an inexperienced first year, he had to learn a lot from his mistakes. Its amazing how much struggles he goes through and seeing him overcome them is satisfying. He has a loud personality but is also very self motivated, which makes him a perfect character to root for and makes him more suitable to be an ace. Season one is him discovering his potential from the help from others and from himself, and slowly developing it so his struggles made a lot of sense. His rival Furuya however, is different because he had natural talent from the start, which was a good contrast. Character interactions, relationships, and their goals is what makes this series great in its characters. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment -9 and overall : I enjoyed this series a lot. It can be slow in pace and some fans might still be angry or impatient about Sawamura struggling so much but for me thats why this series is so different than the other shounen. This series is nothing deep like Ping pong or Ashita no joe but its done realistically in shounen fashion. Its pretty similar to haikyuu but the writing is better imo because of how the sport of baseball is structured where there is a special meaning of being an ace in the team- a person who shoulders the hopes and dreams of everyone else and leads the team to victory, which is different than haikyuu because volleyball has way more teamwork in it. Mainly I love seeing Sawamura working hard to reach that goal of becoming an ace and he still has a lot to learn. \\n\\n\r\n7.5 is my score of the anime. I originally gave it at least an 8 but after catching up with the current manga, season 1 is good but not nearly as good as the current manga. I recommend more people to watch this anime because it is not that popular, yet I think anyone can come to know the purpose of the character struggles and learn to appreciate a writing like this.\\n\\n",

            "content": "So this is my first review so pls have mercy. This review is also spoiler free.\r\nDiamond no Ace ( Ace of Diamond) is far too underated outside of Japan.\r\nThis year DnA was the 7th most sold manga in Japan (right behind Naruto) so that is proof enough of its greatness. \r\nThe story for DnA seems fairky straight forward, to make nationals. However the characters will and devotion to accomplish theis dream is inspiring.\r\nAlso there is so many funny and enjoyable characters in this show that it is hard not to like atleast one. I believe the characters make this show, they are easy to follow,relatable, funny and they way they bond and care with eachother leaves us as massive seido fans. (And Kura senpai's laugh)\\n\r\nThe art fits a sports genre well and is well detailed aswell as great op's. \\n\\n\r\nIt doesnt matter if you arent a sports genre fan, there far more to this show other than gameplay.i know DnA was my 2nd ever sports anime and now it is my all time favorite. I thoroughly reccomend this great and enjoyable series to anyone!  \\n\r\n9/10\\n",

            "content": "[This review contains minor spoilers. Major spoilers are obfuscated with a DVORAK-to-QWERTY substitution cipher. You should be able to find a translation webpage online.]\r\n[This is a review of both seasons, together.]\r\nI am glad that I watched this.\r\nI would recommend this to others.\r\nI have watched this once, subtitled. I have only watched the anime.\r\nI probably won't watch this again.\r\n---- Positives ----\r\nIt's acceptably easy to follow along even if you aren't familiar with baseball, to a degree.\r\nBecause the series primarily follows to growth of a pitcher who was never formally trained to pitch, during the series there's a decent amount of information regarding what types of pitchesexist. For example, you don't need to know what a \"changeup\" [pitch] is because Sawamura doesn't know either, so when he learns what it is, so do you. However, for the non-pitcher-related rules of baseball, you're pretty much on your own, though after some number of games and paying attention to dialogue, you should be able to figure out most of the rules, even if you know nothing of the sport. While knowing all the rules will make it easier to follow the games, the way in which the scenes progress makes it so that you only really need to know the utmost basics in order to enjoy the games, so even if you don't know anything about baseball, you should be able to figure out enough of the rules early on enough to enjoy the rest of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe games are all fun to watch.\\n\r\nAll of the scenes shown during the games are interesting to watch. Important moments happen in 1x time or slower, and unimportant, repetitive moments are usually skipped over. During the games, we primarily hear characters thinking to themselves or discussing strategy with each other. We are, as far as I could keep track of, always informed regarding unique styles of the players on both sides. You'll hear that one player on the other team is a fast runner, and then you'll see them steal bases. Sometimes, it happens the other way, such as a pitcher pitching a new type of pitch, then you see the batting team be surprised and do their best to adjust for that. This event-and-explanation pair are always very close together, so we never feel lost for very long during a game, and whenever you feel surprised, it's likely that some number of characters in the series are also surprised.\\n\\n\r\nThe team sends scouts to watch the games of their future opponents.\\n\r\nNot only does this allow Seidou to be prepared for their competition, it allows us to understand the other team ahead of time. Sometimes we'll even get to see flashbacks of the opposing team to better understand them.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing is uncharacteristically quick for a long-running series.\\n\r\nThis series has pacing that's almost slow enough to make you want to fast forward at times [such as the obligatory silent reaction frames for every major event], but is actually quick enough that I rarely had to actually do that. Having decent pacing really means a lot with this high of an episode count.\\n\\n\r\n---- Negatives ----\\n\\n\r\nThe series suffers from unlucky unpredictability.\\n\r\nWhen the series has tense, unpredictable moments, they will either end badly for Seidou, or Seidou will awkwardly overcome them. This definitely isn't a Hard Work Overcomes All Barriers success story. There is no meta force propelling the team to victory. --and considering how often there are tense, unpredictable moments, the entire series, for me, had this bizarre, uncomfortable feeling about it. Also, I felt that multiple teams deserved to win more than Seidou did - teams that ended up losing to Seidou for no particularly outstanding reasons. This realization of mine was not felt by Seidou.\\n\r\nOpportunity for cancel: No, because I don't think this series was going for realism, and, in addition, the focus of this series did not seem to be It All Comes Down To Luck.\\n\\n\r\nThe series lacks a consistent focus.\\n\r\nThe series comes close to having a focus, but every candidate is scratched out at some point along the series. The focus is not Hard Work Overcomes All Barriers, because many of the teams in this series that worked very hard, harder than Seidou did, lost. The focus is not It All Comes Down To Luck, though, if I had to identify this series' focus, that is what I would pick. The focus is not Let's Go To Nationals, because many risky, illogical plays are made that counter this goal, as even Ochiai points out multiple times in-series. The focus is not Let's Play Our Own Baseball, because there's too much focus on winning and too much focus on the negative aspects whenever the team loses. It has an awkward mixture of all these focuses and doesn't spend adequate resources to any of them.\\n\r\nOpportunity for cancel: No. It would have been a simple matter to choose any one or two of these focuses and shaped the series around them. The series would have ended stronger and would have had a stronger progression throughout.\\n\\n\r\nSawamura isn't treated well by the author.\\n\r\nThe way I thought Sawamura would grow throughout the series didn't happen at all. [Spoilers: D. b.k.p n.apbo dr, yr .q.py yryan jrbyprn rk.p dco mrkcbi uaoyxannw abe d. b.k.p x.jrm.o yd. aj. ru yd. y.amv]\\n\r\nOpportunity for cancel: No. This should have been the most obvious character progression in the series, and it didn't happen.\\n\\n\r\nTheir assistant coach, Ochiai, is an unnecessary jerk in most cases.\\n\r\nPartway through the series, Seidou gets an assistant coach. This coach meshes poorly with the team and the head coach. He spends the majority of his time criticizing the head coach and the players, as well as going around the team trying to make rifts solely for the purpose of, which he even states [as thoughts] multiple times, getting the talented players to like him better than they like the head coach - because Ochiai will favor them and give them special treatment.\\n\r\nOpportunity for cancel: No. However, I'll mention that Ochiai helps out the team with their technical skills much later in the series, and may have even directly enabled the team to get as far as they did. He also dials back his hostility toward the head coach and shows a more comical side near the end.\\n\\n\r\nThe art rarely, yet still, dips very low.\\n\r\nMy favorite bad shots were of the school band. The brief bleacher scenes were an occasional danger zone regarding art quality. I'm motivated to write this negative because of one band shot in particular where their instruments look really wrong.\\n\r\nOpportunity for cancel: Yes. Firstly, most of the art in the series is consistently acceptable - there are only rare occurrences of bad art. Secondly, this is a long-running series, and I've never seen a long-running series with outstanding art - I assume by now that these two things go hand in hand.",

            "content": "Being a rather large fan of sports anime, I really enjoyed (and still do enjoy) 'Ace of Diamond'. The art style is really fitting for a sports anime, and the characters are very well thought out. I'm quite fond of the soundtrack, too - especially when the school's band plays during Seido's games. The storyline is fair, as it is similar to the anime 'Cross Game' (though, that being said, there are distinct differences). \r\nAs I stated above, I feel that the art style is fitting for the main genre of the anime. The art style has thicker strokes, as most Shounen anime have, soit reflects the characters' \"manliness\". If they used thinner strokes, like they do in Shoujo anime ('Brother's Conflict', for example), it wouldn't give you the same \"manly\" feel. I rated the art an eight because, although I really love sports anime, I'm a sucker for \"girly\" and pretty animation (like 'Karneval'). I do, however, find the art to quite attractive - hence the high rating.\\n\\n\r\nI am very fond of 'Ace of Diamond''s characters, almost to the point where I love each and everyone of them. All of the characters have diversity, and none of them are completely the same. Sawamura Eijun, the protagonist, is quite loud and boisterous. In contrast to him, we have Kominato Ryosuke, whom is sadist and devil-ish. Once again, in contrast to them both we have Miyuki Kazuya, whom is forthright, confident and cocky. No two characters are the same in 'Ace of Diamond', and they all have their downfalls - which is why I ranked \"Characters\" as 10.\\n\\n\r\nSince the animators haven't realised the full soundtrack yet, I can't fully judge it. However, upon hearing it during the anime, I can say that I am fond of it. When a certain scene has music added to it (such as when Yuki Tetsuya steps up onto the bating plate in official games), it enhances it greatly and you can practically feel the atmosphere surrounding the characters. When they play unnerving music during serious scenes, it really gives you the \"nail-biting\" feeling. I would like to get in depth with the soundtrack more, by listening to them by themselves, but since they haven't been released yet, I've rated it an eight. \\n\\n\r\nOut of all my rankings, the storyline was the lowest. This is mainly because it is very similar to the anime 'Cross Game', where they too aim for nationals. I did take into consideration that, being a sports anime, and furthermore for baseball, it's kind of the only goal you can really have. I do enjoy the development none-the-less, and 'Ace of Diamond ' does have distinct differences to 'Cross Game' (and I am in favour of the former). Admittedly, though, it did take me a while to really get into the series. It was fine after about episode seven, for I feel like the everything starts to build up from then on. All in all, I ranked the storyline a seven. \\n\\n\r\nTo sum everything up, 'Ace of Diamond' is a very captivating anime and will get you hooked. It's art style is fitting, and the character set-ups are outstanding. The soundtrack is very well done, and it used effectively all throughout the series. 'Ace of Diamond' really is an incredibly enjoyable series, and I'm sure you'll love it.",

This show caused the opposite reaction right off the bat. (No pun intended)\r\nAce of the Diamond / Daiya no Ace has caused me so much laughter, tears, and joy that If I didn't give this show a 10 I'd be lying to my heart.\r\nIt isn't the BEST all around show I've ever watched, however something about it is just really right. It isn't a Shounen where everything goes completely right and you get an invinciblemain character who wins every game. (Although, it does still maintain that Shounen feel) You've got lessons being taught that you could only learn while playing and losing on a real sports team. That is no easy feat; to achieve such an emotion as defeat while instilling lessons in the viewer because of a tv show. \\n\r\nThe animation is AMAZING at times and other times its just solid. It never is low quality (unless intended for comedic purposes)\\n\r\nThe sound REALLY pulls me in as a viewer. I think the emotions behind the timing of the music, the dynamic sound effects, and a crew of great voice actors make this sound category of this show a solid 10/10.\\n\r\nCharacters. 9/10. Just watch it and find out. I won't say more here.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all I enjoy this anime very much for many reasons. I'd give it an overall score of 10 likely due to emotional impact.\\n\\n\r\nI have actually found myself rewatching this anime, so I'd suggest at least watching it once. Best sports anime I've seen.\\n\\n\r\n(sorry for my lame review, I'm not a writer.)",

The story may seem boring at first, but once you are a few episodes in it hooks you and you can't stop watching. All of the characters are amazing, and you see great character development. The soundtrack isn't anything special, it stays the same throughout out the series (so far). \r\nWhat I really liked about this anime was that it wasn't overdramatic, in many cheesy sports anime it's a lot of the classic teamwork and power of friendship; and yes they do have there cheesymoments, but they aren't very common in the show. This show is hilarious, fun, and just overall awesome. I recommend it to anyone who likes sports anime, or just needs something to watch in their past time.",

            "content": "While I am not a huge baseball fan, and was actually a little skeptical at first, Diamond no Ace turns out to be one of the most interesting sports anime I've watched. \r\nThe story begins slow paced but steady and the hype eventually builds up. What I love the most in this series is that it leans more on the realistic side, rather than being too exaggerated or the supernatural. The games are also really interesting and entertaining to watch, and most of the time the outcome is unpredictable.  \r\nI also liked the fact that the series showcases various \"aces\" / pitchers (and notjust the main protagonist) with different personalities, and that getting to the top is not as easy-- even prestigious teams fall while the underdogs win. Nearly all the teams and characters here are very likable. The tracks are also amazing and helps build up the hype in a lot of scenes and matches.  \\n\\n\r\n***However, if you are not open to a series that's not solely focused on it's protagonist, I suggest you can skip this one (rather than ranting about later).\\n\\n\r\nThe character development here is SLOW though,  and might get frustrating but then again, its steady and realistic if you put into account the personalities of the characters. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, its a smart, engagingly entertaining and a great sports anime to watch whether it be that you're a baseball fan or not. :)",

            "content": "This is my first time writing a review, and usually I wouldn't care much about reviews or such but since this anime was a bit underrated in my community, I had to write a review about it since this anime was the one that made me took a liking on baseball.\r\nStory : I watched many famous and well-known sports anime and usually the characters went to an underdog school and joined the club that has few numbers of members, but Diamond no Ace was different. The main character, Sawamura Eijun, joined Seidou High, a pretty prestigious high school with a strong baseball team that hadso many members. It's a new experience for me to watch Eijun struggled in the baseball team to become the number 1 Ace of Seidou Baseball Team. He still have a loong way to go though. I gave the story 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt : I fell in love with the art when I watched the 1st episode. My friend joked that maybe this kind of art was the one that suits me the best. I like how the animators of the anime made the art and animations so it's 9/10 for the art from me.\\n\\n\r\nSound : At first I'm not particularly fond with the first opening but it grew on me, that goes the same with the second opening. The OST was also good, I enjoyed it to the point where sometimes humming it without realizing. But I didn't really enjoy the first three endings, I hope the last ending will cover it since the CV of Eijun, Furuya and Haruichi will be the one who sang it. I gave the sound 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : The characters.. There's more than a dozen. It took me a while to memorize the first string members of Seidou High Baseball Team line-up and boy there's still many to come. But, I enjoy it nevertheless. Each character were given a background story that made me having a hard time to hate them. The Seidou team also supports each other, teaching their player that baseball is a team play and that kind of stuffs. But really, sometimes the Diamond no Ace characters could be a giant huge dorks too. And for that, I gave 9/10 for the characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : At first few episodes Diamond no Ace was the anime that could made you bored pretty quickly because at first it was all about training and practice matches. But, when the summer tournament arc began it became the anime that will made you bite your nails in excitement because you will be looking forward about the matches that are still on-going. At least for me. It's an 8/10 for me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall : I just recently started watching Diamond no Ace, actually. I had to watched it from the first episode to the latest twenties. At first, I thought Diamond no Ace will be a plain baseball-themed anime but I was wrong when I watched the first episode. It's a 8/10 from me. You guys would think that Diamond no Ace will be boring and such, but believe me, try to watch it and you'll think different and maybe ended up watching through the latest episode? Trust me It's a really good and fun anime to watch! \\n\\n\r\nFollow Sawamura Eijun's intense (and sometimes, stupid) path on becoming the Seidou number one Ace!",

I dropped it multiple times and had to watch the last few episodes recently in order to catch up with \"Season 2\"(which sadly follows the same drill). \r\nI seperated the ranting from the review, so feel free to only read the review :)]\r\nGeneral Review: [The story and the art aren't bad, and the characters are actually interesting, but the pace the anime is progressing, especially while in matches, is really annoying.. The main character is hardly considered theprotagonist, though he is clearly special, for an unclear(?) reason. The (writing-)reasoning behind \"why things happened the way they did\" are so bad that I sometimes felt that the writer was insulting my intelligence. It also had it's moments, though; moving certain emotions and funny moments.]\\n\\n\r\nReasoning + Ranting: [The manga indeed has a lot of pages without dialogues, but that's alright because u can catch on what's going on pretty quick and move on, and in my opinion this is alright for a sports manga(although the writing is still terrible). The makers of the anime just took those icons and animated them for, like, ages. I'm actually surprised it has such high ratings, but i suppose it was aimed on a YOUNGER audience(I'm 22 and started watching this anime when i was 20).]\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: [If you value your time I suggest you skip this anime, or watch in 3x speed or something, or even read the manga, as the story is actually interesting.]\\n\r\nPS Note: My low rating on animation doesn't mean that the animations are bad, just badly executed in my opinion.",

            "content": "*THIS MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS\r\nAlright so this is going to be my first ever review, so don't mind all details hehe.\r\nFor me Diamond no Ace was at first sight a no-go anime but then until I actually gave it a try it became one of my favorite. In no sense was I ever into baseball and I've only played it during PE classes.\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nThe story goes around Sawamura who tries to be the Ace of his team, by far he makes such good progress in doing. Every game shows the history or past of the opposite team and most unique characters aswell, such as the aceof the oppposite team etc, the anime goes in depth, also shows a lot of every small detail. The anime story is EXACTLY the same as the manga, which is so good considering that's rare to see nowadays. Second the detail in goal, as in Sawamura trying to be the ace, thinking about how he should get there, how to think about it, how to behave, how to suit to not cause a last to other teammates especially in what his job should be in the team, the anime looks it into very detail and tells specific details once again. But not only Sawamura, they show the past, the goals, the wishes of every character in the series. The idea of having a third year, with variation of different tournaments. The finals being really true to the story, when Inashiro won vs Seido in the Qualification Finals, suited really well for Sawamura as he was inexperienced in pressure plays, one of the best examples. That and very much more.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nAt first, I disliked the art a bit but further being used to it, I liked the detail of many character designs, lay-out designs and more. The one thing I hated was the lack of detail when focusing on a player, the background art as in such. Not much needed to tell here.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nAn anime with by far, the greatest sport OST's ever. Sawamura's theme is just unavoidable, it's so good. As for the openings, the openings are so good and fit their theme arc so well. Especially expected Season 2 to have worse openings, but in such need it was so good and was full of such feeling after watching the whole season, who would get anybody in tears, including me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nAs said before, every character has it's own background, their own past which suits the design of the character aswell, such as Furuya coming out of a cold weather district, fitting his quiet and fast illness in the warm weathers of tokyo. Or the third years who lay their dream on winning before retiring to college, all fit so good onto the character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nIf you really want to enjoy epic moments, you should definitely watch this, this show carries so much momentum after an epic moment, that it's almost unbreakable, or to break up your mood. Such as Sawamura striking out Yakushi, when a quiet sound follows up from the stands because of amazement and then the epic OST plays, these are moments that carry so much momentum that gets you hyped up so much. Aswell as the Tournaments, I mean everyone loves Tournament Arcs, and these are so well done.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nThis is a go to anime, don't judge it by the first episode or the cover like I did. It's definitely worth of your time and the momentum this anime carries is insane. I definitely would watch this if you search for a good and TRUE sports anime with a decent amount of episodes and great storyline.",

            "content": "The mediocre rating I give Diamond no Ace is solely based on the fact that I have seen many sports anime who did it much better. I am sure that if I had watched this anime before I watched other and better sports anime, I would have given it a better rating. I am not going to list all the sports anime I find better. I will just compare it to 3 other baseball anime who did it better in some way or another.\r\n1. Cross Game: My all time favorite sports/baseball anime. The characters, the story, the drama, the tension, ... all of it justperfect. In terms of story and characters is this the best sport anime I have ever watched. The focus is perfectly ballanced between the characters and story and the actual game, baseball. For me, a must watch even if you do not like baseball.\\n\\n\r\n2. Major: This anime is the real reason why I found Diamond no Ace boring and predictable. Diamond no ace and Major are basically the same kind of anime only Major is far superior. Where Diamond no ace only focuses on the game and never really tells a story, Major gives you the same tension and debt to baseball with a compelling story. I watched 20 episodes of Diamond no Ace and couldn't care less for the characters (except Chris-senpai). Major fleshes it charaters out.\\n\\n\r\n3. One Outs: A totally different kind of sport anime. It is not all about Kousien or friendship. One Outs is unique. The story revolves around its protagonist and him outsmarting everyone. It's not about evolving and becoming better. It's about becoming rich. To compare it with diamond no ace, One Outs is smart and interesting. Diamond no ace is boring and predictable.\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion: If you like the premiss of Diamond no Ace, watch Major. It's better. To watch both is just a chore. But make sure to watch the others too. They are really good in their own way.",

Great characters, great art, great story of growing up and discovering yourself while dealing with hardships, great variety in OP's and ED's (even though not all of them are memorable), great source to bring you knowledge about a sport you may not care much about but which you definitely WILL care about once you start watching the show.\r\nI used to know nothing about Baseball and thought it was boring. That started to change when I watched Cross Game, but I still didn't care much about it - then I watched Ace of Diamond and everything changed.\r\nHonestly, thisis one of the most ''gripping'' shows I've ever watched. I completed all 75 Episodes in a little more than one week, and I'd have completed it sooner if I didn't have to work a lot during that week. It looks and sounds great, the animation during the games is so good that I went back to see the characters batting and pitching just because of how gorgeous it is.\\n\\n\r\nThere's a character for everyone here too, you'll not be disappointed (even though you may be annoyed by Sawamura every now and then).\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you like sports (any sports, not Baseball necessarily) or if you're just looking to laugh out loud while watching great action during games, you can't go wrong with Ace of Diamond. Just watch it, you'll not be disappointed.",

            "content": "Rewatched the anime a short while a go and thought that if it was worth a rewatch it was worth a review.\r\nSo to begin with i will give a brief caution to those who want to see it. If your one of those pretty much sick of the main character being largely underpowered in comparison to those around him and to top it all being only as clever as a monkey then this anime is really something you should be careful about getting to high expectations from. i will write both good and bad about the main character so that it gives both of myviews so to speak on him\\n\\n\r\nTo begin with i really like the story since it kinda puts you in the shoes of a big baseball school and its not like you follow a tiny baseball club that has some fantasy dream. It feels real when they talk about it and it ads to the fun of it. The sound and the entire atmosphere you can get from just watching as the pitcher steps on the mound or the hitter stands ready to maybe hit a big homerun. Eventhough im not one to be spesific when it comes to the art i do like it. Its nice and smooth enough but feels like  a sports animation. The main character  which the story is supposed to revolve around has his moments. Eventhough he has alot of bad sides you can say he also has his good parts.  he creates and enthusiasm few people have on his team and he manages to create a good mood and sometimes so funny that you will laugh your ass off. \\n\\n\r\nSo the to downside. As i said before if you dont like the moneky stupidity and majorly underpowered Main character then this will piss you of which it often at times did to me. So on the more negative side of the supposed main character swamura ejun. Why supposed well through the anime it was rare to really feel that he was the main character unless you looking at the first episodes there he is introduced. But after that he dissapears more and more only giving hints of what he might be in the creator of this anime eyes. He is a pitcher with not much room between his ear which he componsate by being loudmouthed and at times annoying and cringy. \\n\\n\r\nTo  summarise fun and good anime to watch if you need a good sports anime that gives you much of what every sports/baseball anime can give you but. There will be time that the irritation might make you want to just press pause and think back on and consider if you really want to continue since something annoying might have happened at the end. I rewatched it because much of it had great parts that i loved and that i could still remember. Things that made me laugh or just love a certain character eventhough he might be wicked. But it never felt great its not like an anime there you want to say this is one of the best sports or  baseball anime you have watched. Its more like this was fun and good maybe i will watch it another time if i feel for it.",

Now it is about time I sprinted toe first into this review.\r\nI finally did it, I made it through all 126 episodes of Ace of the Diamond! Although I didn\u2019t watch the recap episodes so it is a little less than that, but it was a long a heartfelt journey that I did not expect to be graced with. Most sports anime these days last around twentyfive or fifty episodes so if a show is this long it had better be good and for the most part Ace of the Diamond is. This show has some of the highest highs I have ever gotten in sports anime and I can honestly say I actually enjoy watching baseball now where before I found it tedious and dreary. It does a great job of teaching the viewer the necessary information and then slowly adding layers of complexity. Making you appreciate every good pitch and clutch fielding play. There is also an assortment of matches that don\u2019t involve the main team and that leads to some truly nail biting moments as I couldn\u2019t guess who was going to pull out on top in those games, even the main team isn\u2019t safe! This unpredictability helps to raise the stakes and build tension where other sports shows can feel like they have a pre-determined outcome. One of the shows greatest strengths is in how it makes the opposing teams feel real, and that they are people working together even though there are some stars. I found myself rooting for the opposing team after hearing some of their backstories. It makes you appreciate that everyone is giving it their all and I felt heartbroken a few times when the main team won because I had gotten so invested in the other team. While this could be seen as a weakness, as it takes quite awhile for the main team to be fleshed out, I really enjoyed the ride and the second season does a great job of making up for lost time. Now the show isn\u2019t perfect, and the time between games can really drag the show to a less than stellar pace. I found myself setting the show down a few times when I was following it week to week because of those slower sections. They do have some touching character moments and build up drama for the upcoming games, but it can sometimes feel more like an excuse to give the animators a break than intentional pacing. If you are unsure as to whether you want to dive into the show, the first two episodes do a great job of building up excitement so I would watch those two and make your judgement. I\u2019m sure this show isn\u2019t for everyone but as a sports anime aficionado myself I found Ace of the Diamond to be a long ride worth taking.  \\n\\n",

            "content": "I finished watching Ace of Diamond a long time ago, but I decided to write this preview after I saw how underrated this amazing anime is.\r\nI noticed that many people don't watch Ace of Diamond because they don't understand the sport itself, which is baseball. I didn't know anything about baseball when I started watching it either, but then I started understanding it and I realized that it's the most astounding sport ever. Maybe you will agree with me after understanding this astonishing sport too.\r\nAce of Diamond is the type of anime which is very realistic, and that's honestly one of the best things aboutit. The main character, Sawamura Eijun, is a pitcher and has this big dream of being the ace of his team, almost like any other main sports anime character. He is seriously so precious and a very determined player. He deeply cherishes his teammates, and will do whatever it takes to cheer them and lighten their mood. \\n\\n\r\nMiyuki Kazuya is a second year catcher, and known in Tokyo for his amazing ability to catch. Miyuki is the type of character that you would understand a lot more better later in the anime. He is also very trusted by his teammates, and is known by them for his irritating personality (which you won't find irritating at all). Miyuki is the most loved character in Ace of Diamond, so I'm pretty sure you will all love him too.\\n\\n\r\nThe other two main characters, Furuya and Huruichi, along with the other supporting characters (specially Kuramochi) are also amazing. If you want a review on them I would be happy to write it.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, please give this amazing anime a chance, and I'm sure you won't be disappointed at all. It's truly an anime you wouldn't wanna miss, specially if you are into sports anime.",

The story is, yes about baseball, (TBH i don't like sports in general and don't like to watch baseball games) But Diamond no ace is great at capturing the audience. As a person who hates baseball this anime has made me care more. The games are long, but i felt like if i skipped anything, i felt empty and i HAD to watch the whole game. \r\nThe characters, let me say are awesome. Their personalities are each unique and they all have their own story but bondas a team. However, I felt like could have been beter as was just never as good as he wanted to be. I feel that Sawamura should have been better and i wish for him the best. BUT I still feel as though he was amazing in his own way. His personality as determined but still an idiot (by anime standards). The other characters, lets me just say ARE SO AWESOME TOO!!!! (Especially Miyuki XD) Its got a lot of humor but also is serious and pretty emotional. \\n\\n\r\nThe Music, i loved the openings and even the endings and the animation is just great! I love this anime over all and would totally recommend!!!!!!!!!!!",

            "content": "Ace of the Diamond. Truly a series that I've always been wanting to see. Baseball? After watching Oofuri and Major, I was entranced by this wonderful strategic and systematic sport. Both an individual and a team sport, if focuses on the actual game play and all positions are very important. As of now, baseball has become my favorite sport and for good reason. I like Shounen for its wonderful idea and world building concepts but characters are what makes a show for me. Their interactions and their aspiring motivations can be very well be the life of any series for me and that is whyI am not big on romance, or forcing romantic interests in any given show which should be focusing on the promised concept. And that's where DnA caught me at first, it's the fact that it is as pure as baseball manga/anime gets. I've always been wanting to see a show like this, granted Oofuri was very very good in this but the slowness of the updates is not enough to quench my thirst. \\n\\n\r\nWhen I first came across of this series, I was skeptical at the first two episodes. As I am not big on romance, I am not big on underdog stories as well. Sometimes, you just want to see a battle with only truly good players present. (my fave in KnB are the miracles and their matches). So when the plot moves on to say that Eijun will be going to a powerhouse school, I was excited because finally, an elite team. This should be good.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it did not disappoint. The plot may have been simplistic to all but what can you expect, it is a series focus on High School baseball. There are only so many routes to choose from and yet DnA can make one wonder where the story might take us. It's like knowing the destination but not sure how to get there. This is the charm of DnA because it's cliche, but it's a better cliche.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I wanna talk about the characters. Oh, such a large and loveable cast from both the home team and the adversaries. My favorite has got to be the MC, Eijun Sawamura as he is a character that can make anyone like him. Yes, he's cheerful and has a never give up attitude very common in Shonen but this also where a cliche is good and taken a little step further. He's the perfect MC, a mixture of raw talent and the touch of an underdog because he's a diamond in the rough. We get to follow his worries, aspirations and his struggles as he tries to acquire that coveted number. He's literally the sunshine this series has and the fans are never wrong about him on this. Aside from Eijun, we get the whole Seidou team and they are literally the best team for me. Senpais and kouhais, coaches and managers, everyone is doing their job so profoundly than any other sports series I've watched. (it's a lot, actually. my other fave sport other than baseball is soccer and Captain Tsubasa is really good for me, the same level as Major). The team play combined with the character dynamics makes this series very enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nFor the art, I personally think manga is better but the OP/ED can make one think that the animators made a good deal out of this. The music score/OST are full of feels and suspense, oh so very good. The overall enjoyment of the show is consistent, I love it more and more.",

            "content": "I think people looking for thrilling sports matches should give the series a try. For me, it was kind of predictable which team would win but it was still enjoyable for several reasons.\r\nFirst, was that just because the team won the match does not necessarily mean that the main character or side characters won or was satisfied with his performance. Since the mc is a pitcher, when he couldn't strike a batter out and had to get switched out, there is a sense that he lost to that batter. I liked this because I don't like it when everything goes in favor towards the maincharacter.\\n\\n\r\nThe second reason is related to the first reason, there's some rivalry between the characters about who gets to play to be a regular. Its more highlighted here because the baseball team is prestigious, so there's like seventy or more players fighting for twenty spots. \\n\\n\r\nThirdly, the people playing are usually motivated to get on base, hit the ball, etc. So I felt like cheering them on and felt a bit sad when when things don't go well.\\n\\n\r\nFourth, the series gives screen time to side characters and rival teams which makes sense for me since this is a team sport. This can also be a con too especially if you want to see the mc hog more screen time.\\n\\n\r\nOther cons include\\n\\n\r\n-the mc feels like a typical main character who gets called an idiot/baka all the time, super hyper, loud and pretty hilarious. He's like Naruto, basically. (though I like this type character at times so it can be a pro)\\n\\n\r\n-injuries are used to move the plot or give excuses for the mc so the mc can pitch more. I much rather see the mc beat down his rivals fair and square.",

            "content": "Ah baseball, also known as America's pastime. But in this anime we explore the vast world and popularity of high school baseball and the realisticness of both winning and losing on a large stage. Not only does Diamond no Ace portray this very well, it also captures the essence of the dynamics of a baseball team. We also get an inside look at great characters and how they strive to be the best.\r\n Normally in many sport animes, the main character's team is seen as an underdog and not really taken that seriously. However, Seidou high is different. Despite them not making nationals in6 years, they have a certain aura of prestige surrounding their name and already well known in the baseball world. This fact illustrates how our main character has to bust his ass to get to a significant position in such a well known and strong baseball team.\\n\\n\r\n The story in diamond no ace isn't really that special. We have our main character who is from the country who has a gift for baseball. He is unaware of how to use this gift and gets an offer to a prestigious high school where he meets a genius catcher to get his potential truly realized. Now he faces many trials and tribulations to try to become the ace of the baseball team.\\n\\n\r\n  Despite the fairly formulaic plot structure, the story is actually quite well executed which saves it from being a failure. I mentioned earlier that this show illustrated the dynamics of a baseball team well. I say this because this show has a realistic and well executed approach to the hierarchy of a baseball team. Examples would be that a player would have to go through the second string to get to the first string and how new members spend a lot of their time running. I also enjoyed how the strategy of baseball is fully explored which is a treat for baseball fans such as myself. However there was a flaw in that. That flaw is that the pacing in this anime isn't really the greatest. For example when a character is pitching, there are a million things happening from in between him winding up and the ball actually going into the catcher's glove. This really slows down the pace of a lot of games and drags out a lot of at bats when it is really unnecessary.\\n\\n\r\n  Another thing there were some enjoyable episodes that didn't do a lot for the overall plot. However I can't be too mad about that due to some of these episodes containing great character development. Speaking of character development, the characters in this show are great. The interactions and chemistry between the characters is well executed. There are both comedic and dramatic moments present and it really heightens the character interaction. Different traits for each character is present and for the most part they are all likeable. \\n\\n\r\n We know that in any sport we win or we lose. The pain of defeat and the sweetness of victory is present here. The characters also do their best to help eachother to improve. I thought that Coach Kataoka and Chris did this the best because they help the characters grow and mature and learn from their mistakes. A great point in this character growth would be how all of the characters kind of improve over time and how they rise up in the team. The jealousy and rivalry of trying to keep your spot on the team is also here and well illustrated.\\n\\n\r\n I had barely any complaints with the art and due to the series' length, the art improves as it went on. The sound was also great with the voice work being solid and the music was amazing. I enjoyed all of the opening themes as well as the OST as they really set a great mood depending on the scene. \\n\\n\r\n I  mainly checked out this anime because I am now enjoying sport anime. And I also love baseball and can understand all of the depth they go into as far as game strategy goes. So overall if you want an enjoyable sport anime with awesome characters and music with a well executed story, check this one out.",

Yes, he is fired up that is good. But no, he has to be that arrogant, being so disappointed when he cannot pitch. \r\nNot my dish.\r\nUnlike Kuroko no Basuke, one of my fav. Sport anime,the MC in Diamond No Ace, is just too arrogant for my taste. He does things his own way and while the author tried to make him look like a normal everyday highschooler, HE JUST CANNOT BE. *cough* Sorry. \\n\\n\r\nBut the overall plot was okay, so I will give it a 7.

            "content": "Story:\r\nI never, ever watch nor play baseball, and I have no idea about baseball at all. The story is actually quite basic for a sport anime, but somehow this anime took my interest, even though I need to watch several episodes before finally giving myself to continue watching this show. \r\nWith 75 episodes for one season, I firstly wonder where the hell this anime is going? What on earth happen to this anime if it keeps going for 75 episodes? Not even Kuroko no Basket took that much episodes to complete a whole manga.\r\nAnd now I understood as to why it has so many episodes.This show is giving each and every teams their own highlights. They didn't abandoned even one single small team, they at least show a bit of story and/or history.\\n\\n\r\nYou would be wondering (including me), that who is the real main team for this show? You might guess it's Seido, but somehow other teams also (and almost) got same portion on the show. Which is great, because you would understand each and every team, how hard they are working, and you'll be confused as to whom you'll be cheering on. \\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly, even though this might seems like it takes so much time (slow plot) but it didn't. It's actually interesting, as to not many sports anime did this, since usually they focused on the main team/school.\\n\\n\r\nIt might getting a bit boring though, during the game. Because there are many 'strategic mind talking', for me, who barely understand a single thing about baseball, it was something to work on, so I'm a bit tired and bored. But, somehow the action of the game never let me down.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nSawamura Eijun is the main character, but as you watch along, you'll be as confused as I was, who is the real main character? lol since as the show goes, the story does not revolved around Sawamura anymore, there were even several episodes where he didn't get his face on the screen. You'll wonder, I'm sure. \\n\\n\r\nAs stated previously, this show does not only focus on main character and team. It tells the other teams and of course almost each and every one on the team. And not to be surprised, baseball teams have many people, of course.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, this is actually amazing, because you could definitely see each and every character development, their relationship (in and between the team). You will understand each personality. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nGreat, everything is great. Nothing to be complained.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nOh glob. I love their OPs and EDs. I don't know why but their songs are kind of making me in high spirits. All songs were totally match with the scene and sport thing-y.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment & Overall:\\n\r\nWatch this anime and you'll hardly find any great baseball anime as this one. It's refreshing and enjoyable and fun and exciting.",

It's really different from Majors which mostly focuses in Shigeno/Honda. The main character Eijun Sawamura is also a likable protagonist which started off as a not so good player and pitcher. But through out the series due to his hard work, determination and guts he developed a strong foundation or to say his own original style which he can use in the future even though it's still really rough. Although his abilities is still lacking here in the first part I hope by the second season ofDiamond no Ace,  Sawamuras efforts pay-off. Well the same goes for the the Diamond no Ace manga Act II, I'm looking forward for his improvement.\\n\\n\r\nI'm really curious!! when will Sawamura become an ace? and How?. Will he really ever gain the number 1 jersey? or he will become a secret weapon of the team?..\\n\\n\r\nAll in all it is really an interesting anime. The manga is also great to read.",

I specially like how the Coach and the main character's instructor puts faith on him and helps succeed no matter what, its emotional and weall wish we had guidance like what he gets. \\n\\n\r\n And Last of all it made me cry, first anime that made me cry, I love the sense of helping each other out no matter what and trying your best to achieve a goal and the impossible stuff a dream! \\n\\n\r\nTIME TO WATCH SEASON 2, AND PITCH, I WILL BE THE ACE!",

If you have seen another anime about baseball or sport for that matter its pretty much the same. A high school team aiming for the nationals. Its a different perspective from my favorite baseball anime Major but its a decent story.\r\nThe art is great and I have no complaints.\r\nCharacter is where this anime disappoints me, don't get me wrong this anime has some interesting characters and fun ones too. My issueis for the most part character growth feels lacking, for like 50 episodes of the first season, Eijun Sawamura keeps being told he lacks control/power and they don't show anything about him training to fix these issues. It comes up a lot and after watching around 50 episodes it starts to get annoying hearing that his teammates keep telling him this yet he hasn't done anything to try and fix his issues. I don't know if its implied that hes doing training in the \"background\" but this just ended up taking the enjoyment out of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is a good anime, I laughed more than once and I enjoyed it. I will say this for anyone who likes more in-depth character development, watch this anime in spurts, like a couple episodes a week or so. Otherwise it gets tiring not seeing any type of character building except for the occasional emotional character building.",

I Love Sawamura and the rest of characters in this show. Very amusing. And lots of unexpected yet realistic things happen in this show. I love how it's not always a home run. In an anime you'd expect more spectacular things to happen but sometimes it's justan RBI Double to win. They have foul balls, pitching to contact, stealing bases, and emphasize everyone's roles on the team so everyone seems useful.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the music... I can't state how much the music hypes me up when I'm watching the show and the ball flies in slow motion. My heart beats at the ninth inning of every game when Sawamura pitches that last ball. In terms of hype, this is the hypest anime I've ever seen. In my opinion, this is this is the best sports anime out there.",

I feel that was one thing that left me wanting in this series. The desire for Sawamura to be great. \r\nOutside of my main character issues, this series was great. The characters were all very well done, even the less important characters were given depth and some back story.\r\nAlthough if you are looking for another anime like Major, this is definitely not it. Thereare no \"gyro\" pitches here and the anime focuses heavily on realistic Baseball and working from the bottom to the top.  There is a lot of excellent humor packed in with serious moments, I'm sure I will never forget their Koshien prelim games.  \\n\\n\r\nSo for those of you who are baseball fans, or sports anime fans and are looking for a laugh, this series is definitely for you! I know I will be looking to continue the adventure in the manga.  \\n\\n\r\n8/10",

You are probably missing one of the best sports underrated anime. I do not speak English fluently and it is not my main so bare with my grammar!\r\nStory - Story is about Sawamura Eijun a pitcher in his own school. After being invited to play with a prestigious school called Seidou High School Baseball Team with a high level of baseball. we see him improve and hone his skills as a pitcher. And wanting to take the title asthe \"Ace\" of the team. But its not easy as he thought it would be. As the story goes on you will see the MC's improve from many problems he encounter. And as the story progress he will encounter also rivals and teammates.\\n\\n\r\nArt - The art was good as it is (Of course it was made by 2 AWESOME and one of the best studios - Madhouse & Production I.G) I like the environment and also how to use the light of the sun and shadows. Im not professional in looking into the art of an anime. Like the enemy adding pressure then a red aura comes.\\n\\n\r\nSound - I like the sound it blends in every scenes they executed it properly. Gives you the feel of excitement!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - Not a one man spotlight. Its like the all of them are the MC's  side characters are given spotlight not left behind. Its good that not only one is focused. They are likeable characters and funny in their own way. The enemies also are introduced well and also their teammates and backstory of them every team in the story has hilarious members and not focused on Seidou only.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - The story just keeps getting better. Funny moments there are no scenes that ruins the atmosphere. Every characters in the story are fun to watch and has unique personalities. Every scenes are awesome in their own way! I may not be a baseball fan but this just made me want to watch and play baseball games. I definitely recommend this. Its one of my fav anime!\\n\\n",
