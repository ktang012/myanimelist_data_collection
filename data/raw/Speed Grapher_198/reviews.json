            "content": "Main  \r\nNo matter which site or forum I go to I see very mixed reviews for this show, Speed Grapher. And it's usually because the show looks good and dark and gritty but then it's disliked because it's not as action packed as___ &ldquo;insert your favorite anime here.&rdquo; So based on that I think a good review should point this out. It should also state that if you want an anime that's good and dark and gritty but is also character driven and therefore will dedicate a few episodes to building and defining the characters' personalities, then you will like this show....if youwant a show that's gritty and dark but has low character development and more shootings and bigger explosions then watch, Black Lagoon.\\n\\n\r\n Art-Style  \t\\n\r\nThe animation is very good....it's by Gonzo [I'm actually starting to remember these company names]. Gonzo is the company that did &quot;Last Exile&quot;, which had very awesome art and animation, so Gonzo is a good company to base your art/anime standards by. Speed Grapher is very dark and gritty. Even grittier than Black Lagoon because there was really nothing that seedy about Black Lagoon. Black Lagoon tried to make their town [what was it....Roanapour?] seem so bad ass and dirty, but the art style contradicted that image they were trying to portray, it was too clean, too slick and polished. With Speed Grapher, you got the true sense of being in those respective environments; in the fancy mansions you felt it was fancy and high-class, in the seedy parts of town you got that feeling, seeing the trash and hookers and stuff. Also as I said earlier the animation was excellent, good fight scenes, no corners were cut and no looping.\\n\\n\r\n Sound  \t\\n\r\nThe OP, well I never really liked Duran Duran, hmmmm OK well maybe except for the song they did for the James Bond movie also I liked &ldquo;The Reflex&rdquo; but I didn't go wild for this song &ldquo;Girls on Film&rdquo; it's just not my thing. But you gotta respect any anime that's willing to make that their OP. The ED songs were forgettable even if the art was nice. The Japanese voice cast did a good job [I don't think the Japanese have ever really done a bad job....except for Inuyasha's voice, where the US voice was waaay better!]\\n\\n\r\n Story  \t\\n\r\nOK so this is where it's crucial in the review, and this is where I diverge from the reviewers that didn't like the show or at least the story part. Because I really was impressed by this story. Like I had said in the animation part, this story is gritty! It gives you are real no-holds-barred account of how truly seedy and disgusting is the underbelly of the world's richest top 2%! Well at least within the fictionalized world of Speed Grapher. And you see the sleaze up close and personal, right down to the funky drool and the raunchy sex-orgies. This story depicts just how the real world works, that those in power feel then can do just about anything....that since they MAKE the laws, they are ABOVE the law. Sure a lot of things in the story are make-believe fantasy and science fiction but make no mistake that the very core of this story carries a kernel of truth! Political rants aside, will also be entertained [again as I said in the first part, you have to love character-based anime] by the various inter-relationships and dynamics between the characters as well as character development episodes, that lets you know some of the good guys aren't so good and some of the bad guys aren't so bad.\\n\\n\r\n Cast/Characters  \t\\n\r\nI have to say the bad guy, Chouji, stole the show for me! He was tall with long hair, sleek and impeccably dressed....oh and he has a kick-ass power! No doubt in my mind he's merciless, just for the simple fact that he allowed or even orchestrated Kagura to be subjected to all of that sick shit so I can't say I condone his behavior or even understand him on a moral level. He's simply on my radar because he scored high points when it came to the coolness factor. The main guy, Saiga, is an alright guy. I mean he has no 'razzle dazzle' qualities or anything, but he's cool. I guess you would have to look at it from the story point of view, he's supposed to be a normal citizen, he's not rich or anything....even though he's considered high-profile. Also he's supposed to be a bit on the older side and has been though a couple of wars and has seen and experienced a lot of hardcore shit so it wouldn't seem right for him to be this young fetchingly hot bishounen&mdash;right? Kagura, is the princess&mdash;or in this case goddess&mdash;so there really is no need to talk about her, she's cute she skinny and beautiful with long locks. OK, the last person worth mentioning is the blond chic with the gun. I think she's cool, she became a little bit scary and obsessive for a while......and I wasn't feeling that whole 'let's rape an unconscious dude thing' I don't care if he's your man&mdash;it's creepy! OK there are some gay dudes in this show that were not only there to be funny but were actually kind of vital to the plot.\\n\\n\r\n Worth it or NOT?  \t\\n\r\nThis is a keeper. I would recommend this to people because it is more on the 'hardcore' side of anime, lots of sex and blood. I wouldn't consider this one of the anime greats but it is cool, intelligent and picks up the pace when it needs to. I can see my self re-watching this.",

            "content": "Speed Grapher\r\nThis Series has a lot of Adult Subjects such as: Corruption, Greed, Power, Action, Sexploitation, Blood and Gore. So before u even give this series a try u should be careful as to what u are in for. \r\nGeneral Thoughts: This is a relatively old Series exactly a decade old by the time of this review. However it does necessarily mean u should not give this show a try. As it has a lot to offer if u stick around to watching it till the end.\r\nStory: 7.5 ,The Story is about this Former War photographer who is now making a living as a freelancephotographer journalist named Tatsumi Saiga who has found himself investigating a secret fetish club for the Ultra wealthy called Roppongi Club. He tries to photograph the club's \"goddess,\" a 15-year-old, exploited girl named Kagura, but is discovered. As he is about to be killed, Kagura kisses him, granting him the ability to destroy anything he photographs. Saiga soon discovers that Kagura's body fluids, like her saliva, in combination with a certain \"virus\", can give people bizarre abilities relating to their secret desires, fetishes, and obsessions. Club members strive for the honor of becoming \"gifted\" via Kagura's power.\\n\\n\r\n Saiga soon becomes entangled in this secret underground society and the powerful and corrupt Tenn\u014dzu Group mega-corporation that operates it. He attempts to free Kagura, a move that puts the two of them on the run from the Tenn\u014dzu Group and blood-thirsty members of the club with bizarre and often horrifying special power.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot itself I found to be entertaining and it really engages how those with power and control can really become corrupted by that authority and wealth they outline and how they use it to their advantage. It is also set as a cat and mouse game where the main 2 protagonists are constantly on the run as they try to escape the Clutches of the club members and the corporation. \\n\\n\r\nThere is also a revenge story that builds as the story goes which would finally reach it\u2019s climax at the end. The story itself is not exactly the greatest as there are time where it would seem a bit silly and the scenarios a bit repetitive but that it actually improved over time especially towards the second half.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9 What really drives the series is not as much as the story but the characters that are within it. All of who have such complexities in their personalities and histories that all in one way or in another intertwine with each other that makes the story progression even more worthwhile. \\n\\n\r\nEven the one off villains are given some form of development and background that would give the audience time to see as to what drove them to these actions and the reasons behind them. If not u can even sympathize with them to some extent no matter what the justification was. \\n\\n\r\nThe 2 main protangsts are also great because there chemistry works so well. There interactions and behaviour towards another is built up slow and progressively that in the end nothing would seem so forced or overdone. \\n\\n\r\nHowever the real character that has been built up so well and done so right would be the main villain, In order not to give away spoilers all I can say is this, What he started out as one way would find himself different in another.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation: 7 This is probably the series main real weakness, Even for a series that is over a decade old, the art and animation is not exactly the greatest as with other series that have also come out during that time. \\n\\n\r\nAt times it might seem a little foggy or a bit hiccuped and the frames might a little to stiff at certain scenes. However it is not exactly the worst either.\\n\\n\r\n Despite the outdated animation and art it is still good, particularly the animation sequences that reflect the dark and twisted atmosphere that the story focuses on as well as those special moments where the focus on the characters feelings or to reflect their emotions with the animation background in which in those cases they work wonderful.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack: 9 The series features a wide variety of music types which range from classical music such as moonlight sonata, to quire music such as Amazing Graze to a jazzy, action oriented sound track that makes it so compelling. Most of it actually is a combination of Jazz mixed in with piano and acoustic music. \\n\\n\r\nThe classical music is mostly used in scenes to reflect situations that would fit with the appropriate tone that the music is known to accessories with. It defiantly keeps up with the overall scenes and situations that makes watching the series even more worthwhile.\\n\\n\r\nBottom line: 8 If u are a looking for a good show that focuses on corruption and greed as well as fun action and good character build up and a good old revenge story than I would defiantly recommend you Speed Grapher.\\n\\n\r\n It is not a series that would win high praise or a lot of attention but it is a good show to watch if u like the sort of genres that I have mentioned as well as to give something a try when u have some free time \uf04a. \\n",

            "content": "Story (7.7) - It starts when Saiga, who was a war photogapher, started investigating an special underground group controlled by Suitengu, a survivor from an attack to an island in an attempt to erase some kind of weird experience. Only 2 people survived that day, suitengu and saiga. Thats where they got some kind of virus that allows them to have \"superpowers\". \r\nAfter finding out what the group was all about, Saiga decided to fight against them using his special ability, killing everyhing he photographs.\r\nIts a fine story, it started very well indeed, then by episode 12 it gets a bit worse, but still verynice. \\n\\n\r\nArt (7.2) - Art...Although not bad, i think it lacks in some characters design, also is not an aspect that got my attention. But its not that terrible,so 7.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7.3) - Sometimes fits well, sometimes it doesnt fit so well. Besides that, the voices are ok, opening and ending are also ok, the big problem is just the other sound, from the ost some are good, other are not good, and as i said it in some moments the action doesnt fit perfectly with the music. But still ok.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - (9.0) There it is.. i liked the characthers in speed grapher. After i finihsed i can say some things about all the most important characters in the anime, and thats positive. Another point is that the characters have nice abilities, and that turns it more interesting. Not perfect, but for sure one of the best aspects in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8.0) - I liked! I seriously dont think i wasted my time..an anime with lots of action, with fine story and characthers..so i recommend..\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8.0) - Not much left to say, basically its an average of all the aspects.\\n",

            "content": "In all my years of watching anime I\u2019ve encountered some really strange shows that left me scratching my head. But in all this time, despite the Boku no Pico\u2018s and the Kodomo no Jikan\u2018s, and even the Jojo\u2019s Bizarre Adventures, I\u2019ve never encountered anything quite as strange as Speed Grapher, a Gonzo anime from 2005. And this isn\u2019t a strange anime in that it\u2019s inherently difficult to understand or presents itself as wacky comedy, it\u2019s strange because it\u2019s just really fucking weird.\r\nOur hero is named Saiga, a famed war photographer. Working for a newspaper in Tokyo, he gets caught  up in a club whereJapan\u2019s richest and most powerful go to have sex, eat, drink; indulging in depravity. Saiga winds up being captured by these people and is going to be executed when a young girl falls from the sky named The Goddess. She kisses him and  gives him apparent superpowers. He can use his camera to make things blow up by snapping a picture of whatever it is. Anyway, he saves the girl, gets caught up in a plot to destroy Japan, and spends the whole series battling a bevy of strange enemies with  superpowers like his, while also protecting the girl.  There\u2019s biological weapons, gray area bad guys, and lots and lots of really creepy sexual tension.\\n\\n\r\nAnd this is where I find that the series really excelled: the bad guys. Each bad guy had a  superpower related to his or her fetish or addiction. There was a dentist who got off to kissing a tooth he pulled. He turns into a spider person with dental equipment at the ends of his legs. There was a guy in a gimp suit who had elastic abilities. There\u2019s a guy who\u2019s made out of speakers who tweaks his nipples to turn up the volume. It\u2019s really freaking funny and I don\u2019t particularly know if it was supposed to be. I spent more time laughing at this series than I have at any anime I\u2019ve ever watched. So if you\u2019re looking for a comedy, you have one here.\\n\\n\r\nThe entirety of the bad guys is supposed to apparently represent the greed and corruption of the Japanese government, a notion that will be jammed down your throat more often than you\u2019ll like. Especially toward the end, the message is so loud and spelled out in such simple terms that you\u2019ll want to bang your head against a wall. \u201cGOVERNMENT IS CORRUPT! OKAY! GOT IT!\u201d\\n\\n\r\nAnother bang your head theme is how often the Goddess, whose real name is  Kagura and has the ability to give people the superpowers, is kidnapped. If you\u2019re looking for a strong female lead, this series is not for you. Kagura is weak, whiny, and entirely depends too much on someone to save her. A portion of the series is dedicated to her and Saiga escaping from the bad guys, but a majority is spent with Saiga saving her ass.\\n\\n\r\nThe interaction between these two is interesting though and the few reviews I\u2019ve seen for this show either call the character development between these two one of pedophilia or one of brother and sister. I didn\u2019t feel romance in any way brewing between the two characters, but it\u2019s easily misconstrued as Saiga\u2019s girlfriend gets completely jealous of the two anytime she sees them together. This makes the relationship out to be something creepy between a thirty-some year old and a fifteen year old. But nowhere in there is there sexual tension. He loves her, she loves him. If any romance was to be had it\u2019s one-sided from Kagura\u2019s end considering she spent all of her life bottled up in her house with very little outside interaction. So it\u2019s pretty easy to understand if she loves the guy who saved her.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, I should bring up Ginza, the cop whose in love with Saiga and the character who gets my Seal of Best Character award. She\u2019s a sort of yandere, threatening to kill Saiga if he doesn\u2019t fuck her and such. But she\u2019s got a more compassionate side that the series gives a little time to shine. She\u2019s also hilarious, calling out any act of violence as \u201cself defense\u201d. The biggest problem with her is her outfit. Do Tokyo police not have regulation outfits? She\u2019s basically showing off her thong. That is not regulation anywhere lady.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally we have the bad guy, Suitengu. At first he\u2019s a bad guy, later he\u2019s in the gray area. He has a terrible past and back story and he has white hair, glasses, and a coat, so you know he\u2019s a conniving, evil person. In the grand scheme of things he\u2019s not a memorable bad guy, especially compared to the weirdos Saiga battles to get to him. But he served his purpose and became a little more three-dimensional toward the end.\\n\\n\r\nIssues with the series are plentiful, the main one with the story, for me, being the pacing. It starts off pretty fast-paced but the middle slumps a little and the end is protracted and drawn out to get to a slightly satisfactory conclusion. The formula also gets dull. A bad guy is played up then goes to face off against Saiga. Then when that bad guy\u2019s dead, the next one shows up. So it can get a little stale which might be why I felt the middle wasn\u2019t as exciting as the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem is the music. And it\u2019s not the actual music because the OST is fantastic, blending  haunting piano with the jazzy action-movie music of the eighties. It\u2019s the overuse of the same five or six songs. It\u2019s obvious this show wasn\u2019t made with a huge budget and the music really tells you that. The same songs over and over and over to a point of total annoyance. Plus, that damn piano gets stuck in your head.\\n\\n\r\nThe dub is\u2026edgy? There\u2019s a lot of curse words thrown in pointlessly and lots of yelling. It\u2019s a pretty good dub that could do with just a few less \u201cfucks\u201d thrown in to make it \u201cmature\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is dated and doesn\u2019t hold up in any way. It\u2019s low-budget and can look like total crap at points. It\u2019s not  God-awful, but it does make some still-shots laughable as hell.\\n\\n\r\nSo where do I stand on Speed Grapher?  When it started, I loved it. It was wacky, it was weird, it was original. But as it kept going it got mired in politics and giving off a message. It grew stale because of the formula but stayed fresh by introducing ridiculous bad guys. The characters were, for the most part, decent, but  could use more fleshing out. And the ending wasn\u2019t  as spectacular as I was hoping  it to be.\\n\\n\r\nSay one thing about Speed Grapher though: it\u2019s entertaining as hell for all the wrong reasons. The inclusion of all these sexual deviants getting off to some of the weirdest stuff makes the show hilarious, despite the fact it\u2019s trying to give us a message of greed and corruption. It\u2019s an extended metaphor that is given in such a way as to make whatever message it\u2019s sending a joke. Yes, political greed is bad. Yes the country is fucked up. But when you play up the Prime Minister to be absolutely evil then fight him as his head  expands into a giant balloon and his tongue becomes spider legs, your whole message is destroyed.\\n\\n\r\nMetal Gear Solid could throw us messages because, despite the bevy of insane, weird, and otherwise unrealistic characters, there were still human characters and situations we could relate to. And I see a lot of Metal Gear Solid trying to come through here. It just doesn\u2019t work.\\n\\n\r\nThis is an entertaining, dark, and edgy anime. But it\u2019s also not at all as smart as it tries to be, nor as serious. It\u2019s hilarious, it\u2019s weird, and it, ultimately, is one of the strangest things I\u2019ve ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nEspecially Saiga baring his chest to show the ten cameras he has strapped to himself. If ever there were a laughable way to defeat a bad guy, it\u2019s goddam chest cameras.\\n\\n\r\nSuggested.",

            "content": "Oh the 2000\u2019s\u2026 It was a growing period for anime, but produced some of the most gripping series in the history of the medium (Monster, Full Metal Alchemist, Ergo Proxy etc.). It was also a period of time when directors tried new things, for better or for worse and major risks were taken to produce that next \u201cbig\u201d original series.  Produced by the once giant Gonzo studios (Kaze no Stigma, Welcome to the NHK), Speed Grapher tries to push the envelope of an adult anime while making every effort to establish itself as a standalone success. Unfortunately, lofty expectations mixed with inconsistent animation anda sporadic use of themes cause the anime to meander to the point where it loses itself. Simply put, Speed Grapher is what happens when an anime tries to do \u201ctoo\u201d much.\\n\\n\r\nFor story\u2019s sake, Speed Grapher has a solid premise laid out from the get-go. A once acclaimed war photographer, Tatsumi Saiga, decides to investigate the inner-workings of a private club for high ranking Japanese officials in order to help reinvigorate his career. He ends up getting more than he bargained for and becomes tied up in the club\u2019s intimate secrets when he is kissed by a 15 year old girl at one of the parties. The girl, Kagura Tennouzu, has a unique virus dwelling in her body that can be transferred to certain individuals possessing a genetic variant causing mutations. Basically, she accidentally kisses Saiga and now he can blow shit up with his camera. That\u2019s the kind of show we\u2019re talking about here.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime sounded so outlandish that I just had to give it the old college try, and although there were massive hindrances, I enjoyed it overall. The first thing I want to throw out there is that Speed Grapher is absolutely NOT suitable for children. The series is interspersed with adult themes, and incorporates vivid scenes of dismemberment and borderline pornography. Although it didn't get tagged with the \u201cadults only\u201d title, I would strongly advise against anyone under 14 watching this. Unfortunately these lewd scenes are so prevalent that it ends up detracting from the overall experience in Speed Grapher. It's one thing to show shots of ongoing orgies featuring heavyset 50-year-old men when it ties together with the scene (I guess), but it's another to drop them in sporadically. It leaves a bad taste in your mouth, to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the groundwork for the story is quite well written. It features two strong protagonists, each with their own set of goals and morals and plenty of nonstop action and brilliantly paced suspense around every turn. The show\u2019s villain is bad to the core, stopping at nothing to get what he wants\u2026 which of course he initially does. There are a multitude of themes explored in Speed Grapher as well, but due to the sheer number and relatively short air time, most of these ideas become diluted and ineffective. After a promising first few episodes, the series limps to the finish line in the most predictable anime ending of the century. Although so much was attempted, few aspects were actually fully explored or successful. By the end of the series I began to become bored and felt like it drug on into its inevitable conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nThe complexity in dialogue within Speed Grapher is very erratic and inconsistent. One minute they're talking about serotonin levels and brain functionality, and the next they're throwing around four letter vulgar insults and pedophilia references. I'm all for playful conversation, but at least be more consistent. The tumultuous dialogue, mixed with the overwhelming number of ideas explore cause Speed Grapher to fall into a \u201chodgepodge\u201d of sorts, making it harder to understand the overarching message the writers were trying to convey.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter wise, the two mains (Saiga and Kagura) are leagues above everyone else in the series when it comes to development. Saiga is actually a \u201csmart\u201d protagonist, which is hard to come by these days. He is dealt defeat multiple times throughout the series and most of the time isn't rushing to save Kagura with a blind eye (pun intended for those of you who have seen the anime). His motives and justification are made very clearly known and his relationship with Kagura is more of a bond than anything sexual. Fortunately for the viewers, the writers didn't overstep their bounds in trying to make a romance happen between a 15 year old and a 30-somethings washed up photographer. Kagura, in contrast to Saiga is fragile, innocent and pure. She knows nothing about her condition and Saiga does his best to keep it that way. The two play well off each other, taking the damsel in distress concept a bit further than normal. It's interesting to see Kagura\u2019s growth into a more independent woman as opposed to her aimlessness from the beginning of the series. Some of her moments (acting wise) are a bit cliched, but she IS supposed to be a highschooler after all.\\n\\n\r\nOur main villain, Chouji Suitengu is a one-dimensional character on the surface: wanting only money and power to spread his influence. Needless to say it was nice to see his past and motives fleshed out, even though they were somewhat irrational. His acting was superb, and added to the level of mystery immensely. The episodic antagonists each had a small backstory, and starkly unique abilities. It reminded me of Xmen in an odd way, with each of them harboring a strange power only they would have. In the whole scheme of things I don't really care for the one-off approach to characters, and Speed Grapher was full of them\u2026 and it seemed like sometimes the writers were just trying to fill episodes. I was a bit let down that more time wasn't spent getting backgrounds of Suitengu\u2019s henchman, and why they were so loyal to him in the first place. I think there was only about two scenes that expounded on this.\\n\\n\r\nAlright, let's get down to the fatal flaws Speed Grapher has: the animation and the sound. I understand that the anime came out over ten years ago, but there are some straight up sloppy instances of animation here. Disfigured character faces, choppy action scenes and bland background images did not bode well with me at all. I get that the washed spectrum of colors sought to set the atmosphere, but it just didn't translate well for me.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is especially bad. The OP is decent, but the real pain was the misuse of background music throughout the entire anime. I could probably count 8 tracks that were played over and over and over and over and\u2026 well you get the point. The style of music the worked with shows like Gungrave failed miserably here because of their repetitiveness. If you can sing each tune from the OST after watching the series once, they're probably overdoing it a bit. The tracks, in addition to being overused were also too loud, causing the dialogue between characters to be drowned out occasionally. The 2nd ED was perhaps my favorite track of all, and the images were drawn quite well. Best part of the audio? The English dub. It is FAR superior to the Japanese one, and offers much more to the mood due to its noticeable Western influences. Chris Sabat\u2019s role of Saiga was brilliant, and I'm glad to see Justin Cook\u2019s skills on full display here adapting it.\\n\\n\r\nWell, I can say that I really did enjoy Speed Grapher more than I should\u2019ve based on its shortcomings. I'd chalk it up under a \u201ccult classic\u201d or \u201cguilty pleasure\u201d category. It's low brow, vulgar and justice filled, with the standard good guy, bad guy ending we all know so well. I'd recommend this to fans of similar 2000\u2019s shows like Gungrave, Black Lagoon and Darker than Black\u2026 though sadly I don't feel it's technically as good as any of those. Take what I say with a grain of salt, because this could very well be a surprise series for you if you can get past the imperfections. As always, thanks for reading!",

            "content": "Speed Grapher initially seems to have a lot going for it. The plot is semi-episodic, with an overall story arc that binds the individual episodes together. While some people complain about the art, I had no objections there: it is a grim, gritty setting, and the art has a film noir look that fits that setting. Likewise with the sound: while I don't have much to praise about the series's music, I don't have anything to complain about. \r\nWhere it really failed for me was in the category of character. To give the show credit, both the heroes and the villains have well-developed back stories.These are people who have suffered, and it seems like we ought to care about them when they are fail or triumph, as the case may be. And I have to say that the story arcs for all significant characters have satisfying endings: whether the characters live or die, you feel that their stories are wrapped up well. That was one of the things I liked about the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem is that I simply didn't care that much about any of the characters, not even the two central characters. Saiga was a passable hero. In my opinion, he lacked an appealing-enough personality to carry the show on  his own, but he could have worked as a hero given the right pairing. Unfortunately, he was paired with a girl who had virtually no personality at all. Under the circumstances, I wouldn't expect a young girl like Kagura to be a fighter, but she should have at least shown some sense of humor, or charm, or wit, or emotional depth . . . or,  well, anything other than the naive sweetness and vulnerability that characterized her. A sweet, vulnerable heroine is not always a bad thing (such a character can give the hero a reason to protect her), but Kagura needed some additional spark of personality in order to function as a likeable protagonist or a believable potential love interest. \\n\\n\r\nUltimately, this meant that the relationship between the two main characters --which COULD have been one of the strengths of the series--was, from my perspective, shallow and uninteresting. At the end of the series, I was relieved to be done with it, but while I could abstractly note that the finale was a solid one, I just didn't really care about the fates of any of the characters. And, in my book, that's a major failure on the part of the series, given that it tried so hard to develop both villains and protagonists as well-rounded characters. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Story: 8. Pretty interesting story. Kept me on my toes to know what happens next and for that I give it an eight. It didn't give me any chills down my spine that would deserve a 10 but connecting all the stories of Suitengu Saiga and the other characters so well served as a good point.\r\nArt: 8. I love the realistic animation style Gonzo and Asahi used for this series. The action scenes are also pretty good. Could have used more visible wounds though for an R rated anime.\r\nSound: 9. If there is one thing that irritates me about using English in anime it iswhen the English is bad. What stopped this show from getting a 10 (the opening by Duran Duran was sick) was their voicing for the occasional parts in English. I don't know why anime producers can't just get someone actually ENGLISH to do the voicing. Good music though.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime were awesome. You came to love to hate characters like Suitengu and Kagura's mother and get attached to Saiga and Kagura. The side character's are also great: Bob, Ginza, Ryougoku, and Tokoshi are all of Saiga's friends and are great supporting characters. Suitengu's Tsujido, Makabe, and Niihari are great supporting character's as well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9. I really did enjoy this anime. It's dark elements were very interesting (for example the Club) and it was never really boring. Good show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9.",

            "content": "Speed Grapher embodies the spirit of \"close but no cigar\" unlike any other anime I have seen.  The show makes honest attempts at greatness, but it practically feels like various people throughout the creative/production process just said \"fuck it\" and decided to ship out an unpolished product.  That said, there are moments when Speed Grapher truly shines, and are not to be overlooked.\r\nThe story centers around Saiga, a photojournalist who made his big name doing war photography.  When on an assignment as a detective, he discovers an underground club where the rich and powerful indulge in hedonism and depravity.  He endsup in the center of a seemingly occult ritual in which a beautiful girl who the club patrons only refer to as 'Goddess' kisses him, and his life changed forever.\\n\\n\r\nUsing his new-found ability to make things that he takes pictures of explode, he escapes with the Goddess, and swears to save her, get to the bottom of this, and understand his new powers.\\n\\n\r\nIt is from this jumping point that the show starts to try and offer social commentary, to varying degrees of effectiveness.  We quickly learn that the basis of these superpowers is that they have their roots in their wielder's innermost desires i.e. their fetish.  This concept alone is plenty interesting, they way that the series handles the wielders of these powers (referred to as 'Euphorics') could have been better.  Around every two episodes or so we get introduced to a new Baddie of the Week who does something repulsive in their first scene.  They get called on to take down the protagonist, wherein we see that their Euphoric powers are tied to the repulsive thing that they did earlier, possibly as they rant elatedly about their fetish.\\n\\n\r\nWhen combined with the antagonists' speeches on how Euphoric powers are meant to be enjoyed and that to refuse to revel in them is foolish, the takeaway message from it all seems to be 'Sex Is Evil', or at least when wallowed in to the point of having it define your life.   By the end of the series, commentary has turned more to the likes of 'wealth and power corrupt absolutely', which is reiterated at every point possible to the point of losing all sapience.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the best thing about the series is its primary antagonist, who I will avoid filling in too many details about in the name of avoiding spoilers.  However, one thing that I will say was that I found discovering this character's backstory and filling in all the character development that drove them to their current path to be the most interesting and well-thought-out part of the anime.  Even this was not flawless in it's execution, as the final step in the antagonist's plan doesn't make sense and would almost be counterproductive to their primary motivation-- but this short-falling doesn't seem to stem from the character's character so much as from sub-par writing, almost as though the writing team couldn't come up with a better conclusion that would still be dramatic.\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings me to another major issue with the production-- the animation quality.  While some scenes and backgrounds are beautiful, it is easy to tell where the budget went in any given episode.  For every fluidly-rendered fight scene there are three scenes of conversations between off-model faces, lazy foreshortening, and bad collisions.  In stark contrast to many other Gonzo works, such as Gankutsuou and Last Exile, Speed Grapher is anything but eye candy.\\n\\n\r\nAll that negativity aside, I rate Speed Grapher as a solid 7/10 because even for all the flaws it was still an enjoyable and compelling watch.",

            "content": "I was on the lookout for as mature anime series - mature in the sense of gritty and adult themed plot - and following some surfing I found this gem - Speed Grapher.\r\nOnce the I saw the opening with Duran Duran's Girls on Film, I knew I would like this. The idea of the main character using his camera as a weapon was an interesting concept, kind of reminded me of the horror PS2 game Project Zero (Fatal Frame), and although this series has slight horror by the way of various monsters making their entrance in the show, I felt this series to be moreof a action drama. \\n\\n\r\nThe relationship between Saiga and Kagura was sweet and core to the series. It was his teachings to Kagura about the reality of the world which was interesting to watch and you can really see their affinity for each other grow as the series progresses. However it was the villain Sitengu who stole the show for me, after seeing his background and motivations in what he is doing and I personally felt - good on him and hope he succeeds, which to have that kind of feeling for the villain for the peice proved to me that this was good story. YOu even start to have feelings for his back up crew of villains, which again I have only seen in Black Lagoon.\\n\\n\r\nI did feel however the series did become a monster of the week scenario, and the series could have been shorter, but its a TV series so I think we all have to live with this!\\n\\n\r\nFan fave - Ginza was welcome humour relief to the series, however she was a much needed contrast and flip side of the coin in protection Saiga. It was nice to see that similarity portrayed. Plus she fulfilled a guys fantasy of taking control of some situations - if you know what i mean! ;)\\n\\n\r\nWith regards to the sexual themes, were they required? I think this aspect is where Speed Grapher was trying too hard to aim for its intended mature audience, and could've been handled better, but I think it was probably a way of enticing people to watch the series,m thankfully it didn't interfer with the story. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation wise - not as good as Gonzo could be, but not that bad that it effects enjoyment. Sound track wise - fiited the series well, but nothing too memorable that makes you want to OST. \\n\\n\r\nAt 24 episodes not much of investment of time, and if you do like a dark gritty character driven story, and you dont mind some OTT, give Speed Grapher a go, especially past episode 4 where it starts to shine. \\n\\n\r\nAn overall 8/10.\\n\\n",

            "content": "This anime was, for lack of a better word, weird. There\u00a0are\u00a0a lot of\u00a0anime\u00a0that are strange, but they're usually trying to be deeply philosophical or artistic, touch some weird topics, or forcing themselves to be weird. This doesn't really fall into any of these categories. While in some sense it does try to make some philosophical points, these are pretty superficial, and pretty simplistic. While it certainly does have some scenes that have a good amount of artistic flair, that still isn't at the core of why this show is strange. It also does have some strange topics, mostly how degenerate people can be, but thatjust feels like a part of why\u00a0it's\u00a0strange. Furthermore, the strangeness never feels forced, and that's why how weird it is\u00a0is\u00a0so striking, because there's no specific thing that makes it so strange, but rather everything comes together to be really strange. For example, the\u00a0individual\u00a0powers being tied to strange desires is somewhat weird, but if it went full battle anime it probably wouldn't be that strange. But it doesn't, rather it keeps things fairly grounded even when these\u00a0powers\u00a0get completely\u00a0ridiculous.\u00a0The scenes showcasing depravity or\u00a0showing the rich and powerful as degenerates wouldn't\u00a0be so weird if that seemed to be the point of the anime, but rather, they just seem to be the backdrop, which makes it more likely to make the viewer uncomfortable I'd say.\u00a0Just\u00a0all around, there's a lot\u00a0individually\u00a0and in combination that makes it super strange, and that's certainly not a bad thing. Rather, I'd say that it's one of the best things, in that it keeps things super interesting.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of plot, the core plot is basically Saiga simply trying to save\u00a0Kaguya. However, this is made difficult by the real plot driver, which is\u00a0Suitengu\u00a0and his machinations that require\u00a0Kaguya. This plot does a really good job with characters. The main heroes, Saiga and\u00a0Kaguya, have a strange relationship, but they come across really well after all they go through. Other side characters such as Ginza and Bob also feel important enough to matter, and ultimately come across just as well.\u00a0A real strength with this show though, is that the core cast of villains\u00a0is\u00a0great, though not in terms of having super\u00a0sympathizable\u00a0backstories or goals the viewer can sympathize with. Rather,\u00a0Suitengu's\u00a0goal doesn't really seem to be anything beyond simply achieving revenge on the world. But still, they come across as human characters, with depth, and ultimately have an air to them that makes them seem cool despite everything. This is emphasized by the fact that there are also another\u00a0group\u00a0of villains, basically the politicians, who serve somewhat as a foil in that they're incredibly easy to hate. The various side\u00a0Euphoriacs\u00a0were also interesting, in that\u00a0their\u00a0power seemed to delve into the core of who they are, which was strange, but certainly made good characters. Ultimately, all of this drives the plot at a good pace, slowly building things up to a massive scale ending, which was strange, in that both the villain and heroes seem to win, in that their ultimate goals in the end weren't entirely incompatible, and hence even though there is a tremendous disaster, it ends on a somewhat happy\u00a0lighthearted\u00a0note that was reasonably satisfying.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation were really good and there were a lot of good action and artistic shots. The OP for the first half had an interesting concept of basically being a recap, with each episode having a different one, which I thought worked well. The song was completely random but I suppose it worked. The OP for the second half used the same song for a standard OP, but also had great and memorable visuals. The soundtrack was really good with a number of really memorable tracks. Overall the sense of\u00a0style\u00a0and atmosphere created was really good.\u00a0\u00a0\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr: A show that comes together to be very bizarre but still works really well.",

            "content": "The story follows the exploits of former war photographer Tatsumi Saiga, who is on the trail a secret fetish club for the ultra-wealthy called the Roppongi Club where politicians, media moguls and industry CEOs meet to indulge in primal and deprived fantasies and everything from sexual fulfillment to torturing someone to death is possible. He tries to photograph the club's \"goddess,\" a 15-year-old exploited girl named Kagura, but is discovered. But instead of killing him, she kisses him, and the photographer gains a strange new power from that kiss: everything he takes a photo of explodes\u2026 \r\nMy thoughts:\r\nThis is an interesting series that contains alot of nudity and sexual references so I don\u2019t recommend it for those under the age of 16. It depicts the greed in human nature; what people will do to get what they want. The action in the story is really just the encounters Saiga has with the \u2018monster of the week\u2019 that show up to stop him and grab the girl. Although sometimes the villain of the story is to be hated, I found that I liked Suitengu and his three loyal goons. What happened in his life is what shaped him and though you\u2019re sure of what he\u2019ll do; he surprises you when he does something totally out of character. If you like dark, gritty and the hardcore side of anime, then you\u2019ll enjoy Speed Grapher.",

            "content": "Story 5: We have a pretty standard storyline with a few spurts of originality. Basically the male protagonist and the female protagonist are on the run from an evil organization. Oh and some people have super powers. As you can imagine the protagonists have to hide from/kill a whole horde of henchmen while learning about the organization and how they fit into it. Around the halfway mark things just fizzle out. It\u2019s not even like they start up a lame new story arc\u2026they continue the first one with no new ideas. This series could have been 12 episodes long. This anime is watchable ONLY ifyou\u2019ve seen everything else in this genre already. \\n\\n\r\nStory pros:\\n\r\n-Some of the characters have pretty cool super powers. The main bad guy\u2019s power is awesome.\\n\r\n-There are some really twisted themes in here that try to explore the depths of human depravity. Money is portrayed as an all-powerful corruptive force that runs the world, while the elite are portrayed as hedonistic monsters who live only to sate their dark, perverse fantasies (in this anime they are usually violent, sexual or both). There are definitely more than a few WTF moments..\\n\\n\r\nStory cons: \\n\r\n-Some of the characters have pretty lame super powers. The second in command bad guy\u2019s power is a great sense of smell\u2026there\u2019s a bit more but he\u2019s pretty much useless. \\n\r\n-They have this habit of randomly cutting to flashbacks without warning the audience. I appreciate the attempt at developing a backstory but it sometimes takes a few minutes for you to go \u201cohhh, this is in the past\u201d\u2026usually after you see an already-dead character come on screen. \\n\r\n-There are definitely dead spots in this anime where nothing is really happening. There will be long car rides with Saiga and Kagura and you\u2019ll think \u201cthis is a great opportunity for a conversation and character development\u201d\u2026then Kagura falls asleep in her chair.\\n\r\n-One episode is SHAMELESS filler. It\u2019s the worst filler episode I\u2019ve seen. They play 15 minutes of old scenes (usually explosion/action) scenes and tally up the monetary damage as they go along. \\n\\n\r\nArt 5: Weakest part of the show. The animations look pretty dingy and cheap. Maybe it adds to the whole \u201cgritty\u201d feel but it feels dated and sloppy. And oh god I want to shoot myself whenever they show a scene with mist or smoke (there are a bunch of them). It makes the screen look like a giant smudge.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7: I felt like the music was not too memorable. What stood out (in kind of a bad way) was their frequent use of English in the anime (the Japanese version). As much as I dislike listening to English dubs, I really, really hate it when Japanese voice actors attempt to do either American and European accents. I\u2019ve never seen it done well and it always makes me cringe. This anime may be the worst case of it. Jesus, there were at least 2 episodes with 10+ minutes each of \u201cEnglish\u201d dialogue. It wasn\u2019t pretty. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 6: The leads were boring. Saiga is your classic, gruff, tough, scruffy male protagonist\u2026the type of dude who\u2019s burnt out, drinks more than he should and probably has PTSD. His past as a war photographer is interesting but I felt like they didn\u2019t develop him enough. By the end of the series I still wasn\u2019t quite sure what he was all about. Kagura was also kind of disappointing. She lacked any emotional depth and pretty much stayed a pawn for the entire series. The romance story was also done wrong. The ages are just too far apart. Saiga looks 30+ and acts like a broken down old man while Kagura is 15 and is basically a na\u00efve child. I feel like the series didn\u2019t quite know whether to make Kagura a girlfriend, sister or daughter figure to Saigas. For most of us, these are mutually exclusive roles so it was just weird to see them interact in some scenes. Ex: (Saiga to Kagura) \u201cYou haven\u2019t even lived half as long as I have!\u201d wtf do I make of that?. I thought Suitengu (bad guy) was very cool as a character and had complexity and an engaging back story.  All of his scenes were interesting. Despite his depth, he and Saiga didn\u2019t really click well as enemies and there wasn\u2019t any of that synergy between foes (i.e. like in Death Note or Psycho Pass). In essence they didn\u2019t make each other shine. One more thing. I\u2019m a fan of the Yandere character archetype and I feel like the series missed a real opportunity with Ginza. I mean she is psychotic, a police officer, in love with Saiga, and prefers using lethal force over making an arrest. She could have had a much more interesting an influential part in the series than the always-one-step-behind the action role that she got.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 6.5: I realized what this series was a few episodes into it and I continued to watch it for the hell of it. I didn\u2019t hate this series but it left me feeling irritated and unimpressed.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 5: Just not enough substance to keep me entertained or caring about what would happen next.\\n\\n\r\nViolence/Gore: lots of blood and killing. If you want that then this may be the anime\u2019s salvation. Usually something fucked up or violent every episode\\n\r\nLove/Romance: They tried to stitch something together but it came out forced and creepy. I would have gone with Ginza.\\n\r\nSex/Nudity: yes. Lots of bizarre sexual situations. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Want a taste of 80s inspired action, that also manages to hold itself together and have earnest character drama and development? Well, look no further, for this wild ride of a series will satisfy your entertainment needs in every aspect you can ask for. As a Gonzo show, it has sexual themes, romantic themes, revenge, justice, tragedy, conviction, conspiracy, thrill, adventure, sci-fi and all the like. It's a lot for a show to handle but the way it weaves its narrative, along with episodic villains to spice things up, it comes out with some very good pacing, making for an enjoyable binge experience, once youget past its exploitation film aspirations that is. Thus, a true action series with an earnest heart of gold underneath! Oh, and WATCH THE DUB, it's very good and takes great advantage of the obvious western influence of the series, on top of not sounding as self-serious, which helps emphasize the fun aspects more.\\n\\n\r\nThe storyline beyond the synopsis flows very naturally with only a few stumbles along the way, where the pacing is slowed down, looking for material to keep going, only to then move on to setting up the last, pivotal, climactic arc. I cannot overstate how it managed to hook me for an entire day, always leaving the right amount of questions open, with equally rewarding answers. \\n\r\nBut, as a show with many spices, it also includes monster-of-the-week type villains, all of which have their own creepy atmosphere surrounding them. They are all given just enough screen time to seem like true adversaries to Saiga. For whatever minor plot details are left hanging or unresolved, you don't care because the show has moved smoothly enough by keeping tabs on Kagura and Saiga, and later on: the antagonist Suitengu. These three characters make up the heart and soul of Speed Grapher.\\n\r\nThe many, many themes in Speed Grapher are tied very closely to the characters, forming their motives in a believable fashion, creating a grounded world of absurdist realism, not unlike a superhero film with complicated themes. There are more hyperbolic extremes than metaphors, which fits so much better in the essence of an action show that isn't afraid to step into schlock, yet also be earnest in its character drama and development. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is rough on the eyes. The western dark urban aesthetic isn't pleasant, but it also shows ghetto alleys and slums. But we also get out of the city quite a few times, so there absolutely is variety in setting and color palette, even if it's washed out most of the time. It serves as a great background to BLOW SHIT UP, regardless of it. The designs are made to be realistic and move smoothly, yet there are no comedic scenes to where you get other versions of said designs. This would ruin its noir grounded tone. However that doesn't stop the show from having a humor about itself, be quirky and accentuate its weirdness when the time is right.\\n\r\nAction cinematography isn't to be underestimated either, a lot of the close up cuts are done in a thrilling fashion to where it's entertaining to watch, yet economical for production. It's most obvious in the monster of the week battles as well. While the dramatic close ups don't overdo it, to where you see the rough cel lines of a character model, it's kept snappy where it needs to be, yet also underlines a dramatic moment just right, in whatever ridiculous circumstance. And that's not to take away from the creative, yet also tactically savvy skirmishes.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is servicable, keeps tension and pressure when needed. Lightens the mood during downtime. Accentuates the BOOMING action with joy and glory. Everything you need a good ost a audio design to do, especially the tension soundtrack, it works very well for the moments it is picked and is in my head since the climax of episode 1. But the bigger credit here should go to the Funimation dubbing team. They uplifted the material into a whole new territory where it doesn't feel as dry or as self-serious as the Japanese voicing. There's a better, softer, and equally somber flow to the American English, and even if it is set in Tokyo and its surroundings, the noir urban atmosphere, along with the 80s action and exploitation film influence it fits like a glove. Kagura doesn't need to sound like a squeaky school girl, she is 16 after all. Saiga is just as impassioned and badass, while Suitengu captures every frame he is in with his charming presence that makes you tingle, with his buttery smooth voice.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, oh, the characters. Saiga in a lot of ways is your shounen protagonist. Yet as an adult he is free to be proactive as much as he goddamn wants, and less reactive to the plot. He IS a driving force quite a few times throughout the show, and every time it is backed by an impassioned, idealistic motive of his that is pure in spirit. He is the reason why I would call this show an adult shounen, due to him representing ideals of righteousness and especially freedom, be it from materialistic or spiritualistic bonds. He isn't cocky, and fights when he needs to, not when he pleases. He runs away from overwhelming forces, but is not afraid to push forward the mystery behind his newly acquired powers. A war journalist at heart, seeking an intense experience that enables him do everything in the show. He feels alive, but you also see what he's like before we got to the juicy action he craves for subconsciously.\\n\r\nKagura is quite the intriguing character. She in aspects embodies the angsty teen, but as she becomes unsheltered and embraces the sweet smell of freedom, slowly becomes something much more than a damsel in distress plot device. At the end of her journey, she is shown to be her own, independent woman. Not afraid to take rash action and control. Doesn't play the \"I'm sheltered\" gimmick for too long, but naturally she feels guilty for her own powers within her that essentially are the basis for the plot. \\n\\n\r\nAnd finally Suitengu. This guy may remind you of Sepphiroth, but trust me he is his own person as well. He is more than a mercenary, ruthless capitalist, he has an underlined, pervasive charm than that. One of the most amazing turnarounds is his backstory, providing new thematic avenues worthy of the final arc that's all about him. Why he treasures Kagura on a personal level and wants her back at any cost. In the end he is not the true foil to Saiga, but rather someone who takes freedom in a completely different direction. One that is ever so personal, yet grand at the same time. He is truly a memorable and supremely villain that you come to respect throughout and at the climactic end of the series. \\n\\n\r\nNotable supporting characters include Mrs Tennouzu and Ginza. Mrs Tennouzu is more of a background story filler character, she has her own sets of characteristics and mysteries that are revealed over time, also fleshing out her behavior and her approach to politics, how she acquired her position in the story. \\n\r\nInspector Ginza is obsessed with Saiga, but not in a healthy way, nor is he recipient of it. In a lot of ways she may remind you of Revy from Black Lagoon, albeit less aggressive and more sensual. She gets her own subtle development over time, yet still manages to hold screen presence as an essential support character that follows the plot with the viewer. \\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment of the series doesn't only come from how bingable it is. But, for the earnest storytelling it offers. The explanations it provides satisfy the autist in me just enough. The twists and turns of the story hit all the right notes. The monster of the week battles never felt like they interfere with previous plot establishments. They accentuate what began as schlock entertainment. It's a main dish of action with lots of different spices that give it a distinct taste of its own that is astringently sweet. The sex and BDSM imagery is an aesthetic I'm completely unphased by, for the show manages to handle all its tones with a masterful stroke, whether its absurd or dramatic. But above all, I respect the show for being honest to the ore with what it is: entertainment. \\n\r\nIt is not here for any huge twist to present a perspective of life, nor is it insulting to my intelligence in providing a sloppy plot with flimsy motivations and dark twists for their own sake. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I loved my time with this show. But due to its inherent nature as a purely entertainment action series, with no aspirations for anything higher, which in turn takes to its advantage all the way. Including a satisfying epilogue conclusion to everyone's arcs and plot threads after all is said and done. So you can safely invest in this experience and come out satisfied at the end. Assuming you enjoy bizarre superpowers, schlock overtones and monster of the week battles. Who knows, this might just be the close up you've been wanting.",

Nowadays, there is no more fine piece like this and monster, Steingate anime anymore. Truely recommand for mature audience, not for kids. Suitengu starts up this society, then the photographer guy, Saiga, crashes the party, gets kissed by the girl with the power-giving powers, Kagura, gets his powers to kill/explode things through his camera lens, and then kidnaps the girl and kills a bunch of richies as he makeshis break for freedom. Then the chase begins. This is a multi-angled chase too. Suitengu's boys are after Saiga and Kagara; Saiga and Kagara are after relics of both their pasts; and Saiga's domineering S&M fuck buddy, police detective Ginza, is after her boytoy in order to keep him all to herself. Then the show becomes a bit like Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon in that it becomes \"He's got the sword.. Now the other guy has the sword.... Now he's got it back again... No, wait, now somebody else has the sword!\" Only instead of \"sword\" I mean \"weak-willed, rich, little, persecuted, teenage girl named Kagara.\" It doesn't get tedious, and quite frankly it does advance the plot; it just seems like they could have done something more interesting. Whatever. It's just, wow, really strange to make this show seem somewhat normal in this review. Because it is as bizarro a show as one could imagine. Strange. Very strange. Imagine watching Terry Gilliam's Brazil or Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas for the first time when you're 3 years old, and that's kind of like what this show is like to an adult with the mind of a child (i.e. me and people like me).",

            "content": "Here's my first review... \r\nSpeed Grapher, an anime mostly about  money, abuse of power and more money. Overall it's very darktoned and dramatic. Not my kind of thing but I decided to watch it anyway. \r\nStory: 7\r\nA girl, Kagura, is drugged and used to pleasure rich politicians. Then a famous photographer, Saiga, gets caught up in it and decides he wants to save the girl. \r\nThe main story is that of Kagura and Saiga. Infected with a virus (at least I think it is a virus) they try to save themselves while escaping from the aristocrats who try to capture them. \r\nBehind this thereis a deeper story which centers on the \"dirty politicians\" and messed up society we live in. Though showing their good face to the citizens, these politicians abuse their power to achieve money and sexual pleasure. \\n\r\nIt's not my thing, but it portrays reality pretty good. \\n\r\nThen there also is the supernatural part in which people turn into maniacs who basically have orgasms collecting human legs, eating diamonds or bouncing around like tennis balls.  I hoped the story would center more on the virus which inflicts these crazy habits and abilities, but it didn't. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 5\\n\r\nDidn't like it. Very little color, but I suppose that goes with the dark tone the anime has. Little time was spend on the caracter design. They only one I enjoyed watching was Tsujido. \\n\r\nDon't remember the backgrounds too well so I guess they weren't too special either.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4 \\n\r\nAt the beginning the music was nice. The fact that they only used 3 tracks in the entire anime bothered me. \\n\r\nOpening was nice, so is the video that goes with it. The first ending was horrible, Shione Yukawa just can't sing. Luckily halfway the series they save us by changing the ending song to another, much better, one. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7 \\n\r\nThey are good characters, Saiga, Kagura, Suitengu, Tsujido... Very distinct, each with a fixed goal to achieve. They are all quite powerful characters. Kagura I liked least, she's so manipulative, running behind anyone depending on how she feels. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\r\nIf you like this kind of drama you'll probably enjoy it a lot more then I did. It's a story about reality like we all know it. I see it every day so I don't have to see it in an anime too. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6 \\n\r\nIt's a good anime, has a lot of drama and criticizes society. It also has quite a bit of supernatural events to make things more interesting. If I would be neutral about my preferences in anime I would probably give this an 8. But I expected a more supernatural-based anime, which I didn't get, hence the 6. \\n\r\nIf you're looking for a dramatic view on society however, you'll probably enjoy this very much.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Speed Grapher is about a man named Saiga. Saiga is a photojournalist who's seen it all. He is well known for being a war photographer. He now lives in Tokyo doing regular photo work and is completely disappointed with his work, until one night he stumbles into a secret club where he finds some of the darkest most disturbing truths about the world around him. But amongst the grim he find's the beautiful girl which to him instantly becomes the perfect subject for his camera. All hell breaks loose and Saiga now finds himself with a new disturbing power which he can't explain and theyoung female who doesn't understand what's going on either. They end up running for their lives while trying to solve the mystery behind Saiga's powers and the girls connection to the club and what it all means for the city.\\n\\n\r\nStory: The story is well told and very complex. This anime does a great job of showing some of the more disturbing sides of life. You can actually walk away with a wider perspective of some of the ways people in this world actually think.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is very sharp  and crisp. The scenery changes quite a bit giving you different contrast in colors so that you're not always looking at the same thing.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The music and sound of the anime is good but probably one of the weaker points not because it is bad but more because it really doesn't stand out much on its own at any point.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Other than the main character's, you'll meet a new character every episode. It's unique in the fact even in just a 30 minute episode the creators do a great job of letting you understand the new character's quite well before the end of the episode. The main character's are very well explained through the show, you're constantly learning something new about them while you watch the story progress.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: While you're constantly wondering what's going to happen next. You'll also be trying to understand the world in where this is all taking place as and get a handle on it. It's definitely a suspenseful show that does a great job of making you sit back and think about the world around you.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I'd recommend this show to anyone that like's a interesting story but its definitely at an off beat pace. Be forewarned though, this anime delves into the sick and perverse side of human lives, so you'll see a couple slightly disturbing imagines depending on how sensitive you are to said scenes. But the show tells a great story which gives some good insight to life.",

And the lyrics... \"I'm all jittery like a horse's tail\"? That's, like, the worst simile ever. The opening theme is fantastic, though, and the dubbing simply kicks ass. You will hear lines like \"Get me more diamonds, you cocksuckers!\", \"Geez lady, that was fucked up\", and \"Try not to crap yourself with excitement.\"\r\nCharacter:The characters are great and they have different sides to them. Like the gun-toting detective woman you'll meet in episode one. You think you have her figured out, but then in the third volume it turns out she's more than meets the eye.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This is a nine only because I don't like Tsujido (sp?). Just plain don't like him. Yeah you are probably saying that should go under 'Character', but I don't enjoy this character... I found out his voice is Greg Ayres, and that might be why I dislike him.\\n\r\nOverall: MUST SEE.",

            "content": "Main  \r\nNo matter which site or forum I go to I see very mixed reviews for this show, Speed Grapher. And it's usually because the show looks good and dark and gritty but then it's disliked because it's not as action packed as___ &ldquo;insert your favorite anime here.&rdquo; So based on that I think a good review should point this out. It should also state that if you want an anime that's good and dark and gritty but is also character driven and therefore will dedicate a few episodes to building and defining the characters' personalities, then you will like this show....if youwant a show that's gritty and dark but has low character development and more shootings and bigger explosions then watch, Black Lagoon.\\n\\n\r\n Art-Style  \t\\n\r\nThe animation is very good....it's by Gonzo [I'm actually starting to remember these company names]. Gonzo is the company that did &quot;Last Exile&quot;, which had very awesome art and animation, so Gonzo is a good company to base your art/anime standards by. Speed Grapher is very dark and gritty. Even grittier than Black Lagoon because there was really nothing that seedy about Black Lagoon. Black Lagoon tried to make their town [what was it....Roanapour?] seem so bad ass and dirty, but the art style contradicted that image they were trying to portray, it was too clean, too slick and polished. With Speed Grapher, you got the true sense of being in those respective environments; in the fancy mansions you felt it was fancy and high-class, in the seedy parts of town you got that feeling, seeing the trash and hookers and stuff. Also as I said earlier the animation was excellent, good fight scenes, no corners were cut and no looping.\\n\\n\r\n Sound  \t\\n\r\nThe OP, well I never really liked Duran Duran, hmmmm OK well maybe except for the song they did for the James Bond movie also I liked &ldquo;The Reflex&rdquo; but I didn't go wild for this song &ldquo;Girls on Film&rdquo; it's just not my thing. But you gotta respect any anime that's willing to make that their OP. The ED songs were forgettable even if the art was nice. The Japanese voice cast did a good job [I don't think the Japanese have ever really done a bad job....except for Inuyasha's voice, where the US voice was waaay better!]\\n\\n\r\n Story  \t\\n\r\nOK so this is where it's crucial in the review, and this is where I diverge from the reviewers that didn't like the show or at least the story part. Because I really was impressed by this story. Like I had said in the animation part, this story is gritty! It gives you are real no-holds-barred account of how truly seedy and disgusting is the underbelly of the world's richest top 2%! Well at least within the fictionalized world of Speed Grapher. And you see the sleaze up close and personal, right down to the funky drool and the raunchy sex-orgies. This story depicts just how the real world works, that those in power feel then can do just about anything....that since they MAKE the laws, they are ABOVE the law. Sure a lot of things in the story are make-believe fantasy and science fiction but make no mistake that the very core of this story carries a kernel of truth! Political rants aside, will also be entertained [again as I said in the first part, you have to love character-based anime] by the various inter-relationships and dynamics between the characters as well as character development episodes, that lets you know some of the good guys aren't so good and some of the bad guys aren't so bad.\\n\\n\r\n Cast/Characters  \t\\n\r\nI have to say the bad guy, Chouji, stole the show for me! He was tall with long hair, sleek and impeccably dressed....oh and he has a kick-ass power! No doubt in my mind he's merciless, just for the simple fact that he allowed or even orchestrated Kagura to be subjected to all of that sick shit so I can't say I condone his behavior or even understand him on a moral level. He's simply on my radar because he scored high points when it came to the coolness factor. The main guy, Saiga, is an alright guy. I mean he has no 'razzle dazzle' qualities or anything, but he's cool. I guess you would have to look at it from the story point of view, he's supposed to be a normal citizen, he's not rich or anything....even though he's considered high-profile. Also he's supposed to be a bit on the older side and has been though a couple of wars and has seen and experienced a lot of hardcore shit so it wouldn't seem right for him to be this young fetchingly hot bishounen&mdash;right? Kagura, is the princess&mdash;or in this case goddess&mdash;so there really is no need to talk about her, she's cute she skinny and beautiful with long locks. OK, the last person worth mentioning is the blond chic with the gun. I think she's cool, she became a little bit scary and obsessive for a while......and I wasn't feeling that whole 'let's rape an unconscious dude thing' I don't care if he's your man&mdash;it's creepy! OK there are some gay dudes in this show that were not only there to be funny but were actually kind of vital to the plot.\\n\\n\r\n Worth it or NOT?  \t\\n\r\nThis is a keeper. I would recommend this to people because it is more on the 'hardcore' side of anime, lots of sex and blood. I wouldn't consider this one of the anime greats but it is cool, intelligent and picks up the pace when it needs to. I can see my self re-watching this.",

            "content": "Speed Grapher\r\nThis Series has a lot of Adult Subjects such as: Corruption, Greed, Power, Action, Sexploitation, Blood and Gore. So before u even give this series a try u should be careful as to what u are in for. \r\nGeneral Thoughts: This is a relatively old Series exactly a decade old by the time of this review. However it does necessarily mean u should not give this show a try. As it has a lot to offer if u stick around to watching it till the end.\r\nStory: 7.5 ,The Story is about this Former War photographer who is now making a living as a freelancephotographer journalist named Tatsumi Saiga who has found himself investigating a secret fetish club for the Ultra wealthy called Roppongi Club. He tries to photograph the club's \"goddess,\" a 15-year-old, exploited girl named Kagura, but is discovered. As he is about to be killed, Kagura kisses him, granting him the ability to destroy anything he photographs. Saiga soon discovers that Kagura's body fluids, like her saliva, in combination with a certain \"virus\", can give people bizarre abilities relating to their secret desires, fetishes, and obsessions. Club members strive for the honor of becoming \"gifted\" via Kagura's power.\\n\\n\r\n Saiga soon becomes entangled in this secret underground society and the powerful and corrupt Tenn\u014dzu Group mega-corporation that operates it. He attempts to free Kagura, a move that puts the two of them on the run from the Tenn\u014dzu Group and blood-thirsty members of the club with bizarre and often horrifying special power.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot itself I found to be entertaining and it really engages how those with power and control can really become corrupted by that authority and wealth they outline and how they use it to their advantage. It is also set as a cat and mouse game where the main 2 protagonists are constantly on the run as they try to escape the Clutches of the club members and the corporation. \\n\\n\r\nThere is also a revenge story that builds as the story goes which would finally reach it\u2019s climax at the end. The story itself is not exactly the greatest as there are time where it would seem a bit silly and the scenarios a bit repetitive but that it actually improved over time especially towards the second half.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9 What really drives the series is not as much as the story but the characters that are within it. All of who have such complexities in their personalities and histories that all in one way or in another intertwine with each other that makes the story progression even more worthwhile. \\n\\n\r\nEven the one off villains are given some form of development and background that would give the audience time to see as to what drove them to these actions and the reasons behind them. If not u can even sympathize with them to some extent no matter what the justification was. \\n\\n\r\nThe 2 main protangsts are also great because there chemistry works so well. There interactions and behaviour towards another is built up slow and progressively that in the end nothing would seem so forced or overdone. \\n\\n\r\nHowever the real character that has been built up so well and done so right would be the main villain, In order not to give away spoilers all I can say is this, What he started out as one way would find himself different in another.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation: 7 This is probably the series main real weakness, Even for a series that is over a decade old, the art and animation is not exactly the greatest as with other series that have also come out during that time. \\n\\n\r\nAt times it might seem a little foggy or a bit hiccuped and the frames might a little to stiff at certain scenes. However it is not exactly the worst either.\\n\\n\r\n Despite the outdated animation and art it is still good, particularly the animation sequences that reflect the dark and twisted atmosphere that the story focuses on as well as those special moments where the focus on the characters feelings or to reflect their emotions with the animation background in which in those cases they work wonderful.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack: 9 The series features a wide variety of music types which range from classical music such as moonlight sonata, to quire music such as Amazing Graze to a jazzy, action oriented sound track that makes it so compelling. Most of it actually is a combination of Jazz mixed in with piano and acoustic music. \\n\\n\r\nThe classical music is mostly used in scenes to reflect situations that would fit with the appropriate tone that the music is known to accessories with. It defiantly keeps up with the overall scenes and situations that makes watching the series even more worthwhile.\\n\\n\r\nBottom line: 8 If u are a looking for a good show that focuses on corruption and greed as well as fun action and good character build up and a good old revenge story than I would defiantly recommend you Speed Grapher.\\n\\n\r\n It is not a series that would win high praise or a lot of attention but it is a good show to watch if u like the sort of genres that I have mentioned as well as to give something a try when u have some free time \uf04a. \\n",

Only 2 people survived that day, suitengu and saiga. Thats where they got some kind of virus that allows them to have \"superpowers\". \r\nAfter finding out what the group was all about, Saiga decided to fight against them using his special ability, killing everyhing he photographs.\r\nIts a fine story, it started very well indeed, then by episode 12 it gets a bit worse, but still verynice. \\n\\n\r\nArt (7.2) - Art...Although not bad, i think it lacks in some characters design, also is not an aspect that got my attention. But its not that terrible,so 7.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7.3) - Sometimes fits well, sometimes it doesnt fit so well. Besides that, the voices are ok, opening and ending are also ok, the big problem is just the other sound, from the ost some are good, other are not good, and as i said it in some moments the action doesnt fit perfectly with the music. But still ok.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - (9.0) There it is.. i liked the characthers in speed grapher. After i finihsed i can say some things about all the most important characters in the anime, and thats positive. Another point is that the characters have nice abilities, and that turns it more interesting. Not perfect, but for sure one of the best aspects in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8.0) - I liked! I seriously dont think i wasted my time..an anime with lots of action, with fine story and characthers..so i recommend..\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8.0) - Not much left to say, basically its an average of all the aspects.\\n",

            "content": "In all my years of watching anime I\u2019ve encountered some really strange shows that left me scratching my head. But in all this time, despite the Boku no Pico\u2018s and the Kodomo no Jikan\u2018s, and even the Jojo\u2019s Bizarre Adventures, I\u2019ve never encountered anything quite as strange as Speed Grapher, a Gonzo anime from 2005. And this isn\u2019t a strange anime in that it\u2019s inherently difficult to understand or presents itself as wacky comedy, it\u2019s strange because it\u2019s just really fucking weird.\r\nOur hero is named Saiga, a famed war photographer. Working for a newspaper in Tokyo, he gets caught  up in a club whereJapan\u2019s richest and most powerful go to have sex, eat, drink; indulging in depravity. Saiga winds up being captured by these people and is going to be executed when a young girl falls from the sky named The Goddess. She kisses him and  gives him apparent superpowers. He can use his camera to make things blow up by snapping a picture of whatever it is. Anyway, he saves the girl, gets caught up in a plot to destroy Japan, and spends the whole series battling a bevy of strange enemies with  superpowers like his, while also protecting the girl.  There\u2019s biological weapons, gray area bad guys, and lots and lots of really creepy sexual tension.\\n\\n\r\nAnd this is where I find that the series really excelled: the bad guys. Each bad guy had a  superpower related to his or her fetish or addiction. There was a dentist who got off to kissing a tooth he pulled. He turns into a spider person with dental equipment at the ends of his legs. There was a guy in a gimp suit who had elastic abilities. There\u2019s a guy who\u2019s made out of speakers who tweaks his nipples to turn up the volume. It\u2019s really freaking funny and I don\u2019t particularly know if it was supposed to be. I spent more time laughing at this series than I have at any anime I\u2019ve ever watched. So if you\u2019re looking for a comedy, you have one here.\\n\\n\r\nThe entirety of the bad guys is supposed to apparently represent the greed and corruption of the Japanese government, a notion that will be jammed down your throat more often than you\u2019ll like. Especially toward the end, the message is so loud and spelled out in such simple terms that you\u2019ll want to bang your head against a wall. \u201cGOVERNMENT IS CORRUPT! OKAY! GOT IT!\u201d\\n\\n\r\nAnother bang your head theme is how often the Goddess, whose real name is  Kagura and has the ability to give people the superpowers, is kidnapped. If you\u2019re looking for a strong female lead, this series is not for you. Kagura is weak, whiny, and entirely depends too much on someone to save her. A portion of the series is dedicated to her and Saiga escaping from the bad guys, but a majority is spent with Saiga saving her ass.\\n\\n\r\nThe interaction between these two is interesting though and the few reviews I\u2019ve seen for this show either call the character development between these two one of pedophilia or one of brother and sister. I didn\u2019t feel romance in any way brewing between the two characters, but it\u2019s easily misconstrued as Saiga\u2019s girlfriend gets completely jealous of the two anytime she sees them together. This makes the relationship out to be something creepy between a thirty-some year old and a fifteen year old. But nowhere in there is there sexual tension. He loves her, she loves him. If any romance was to be had it\u2019s one-sided from Kagura\u2019s end considering she spent all of her life bottled up in her house with very little outside interaction. So it\u2019s pretty easy to understand if she loves the guy who saved her.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, I should bring up Ginza, the cop whose in love with Saiga and the character who gets my Seal of Best Character award. She\u2019s a sort of yandere, threatening to kill Saiga if he doesn\u2019t fuck her and such. But she\u2019s got a more compassionate side that the series gives a little time to shine. She\u2019s also hilarious, calling out any act of violence as \u201cself defense\u201d. The biggest problem with her is her outfit. Do Tokyo police not have regulation outfits? She\u2019s basically showing off her thong. That is not regulation anywhere lady.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally we have the bad guy, Suitengu. At first he\u2019s a bad guy, later he\u2019s in the gray area. He has a terrible past and back story and he has white hair, glasses, and a coat, so you know he\u2019s a conniving, evil person. In the grand scheme of things he\u2019s not a memorable bad guy, especially compared to the weirdos Saiga battles to get to him. But he served his purpose and became a little more three-dimensional toward the end.\\n\\n\r\nIssues with the series are plentiful, the main one with the story, for me, being the pacing. It starts off pretty fast-paced but the middle slumps a little and the end is protracted and drawn out to get to a slightly satisfactory conclusion. The formula also gets dull. A bad guy is played up then goes to face off against Saiga. Then when that bad guy\u2019s dead, the next one shows up. So it can get a little stale which might be why I felt the middle wasn\u2019t as exciting as the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem is the music. And it\u2019s not the actual music because the OST is fantastic, blending  haunting piano with the jazzy action-movie music of the eighties. It\u2019s the overuse of the same five or six songs. It\u2019s obvious this show wasn\u2019t made with a huge budget and the music really tells you that. The same songs over and over and over to a point of total annoyance. Plus, that damn piano gets stuck in your head.\\n\\n\r\nThe dub is\u2026edgy? There\u2019s a lot of curse words thrown in pointlessly and lots of yelling. It\u2019s a pretty good dub that could do with just a few less \u201cfucks\u201d thrown in to make it \u201cmature\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is dated and doesn\u2019t hold up in any way. It\u2019s low-budget and can look like total crap at points. It\u2019s not  God-awful, but it does make some still-shots laughable as hell.\\n\\n\r\nSo where do I stand on Speed Grapher?  When it started, I loved it. It was wacky, it was weird, it was original. But as it kept going it got mired in politics and giving off a message. It grew stale because of the formula but stayed fresh by introducing ridiculous bad guys. The characters were, for the most part, decent, but  could use more fleshing out. And the ending wasn\u2019t  as spectacular as I was hoping  it to be.\\n\\n\r\nSay one thing about Speed Grapher though: it\u2019s entertaining as hell for all the wrong reasons. The inclusion of all these sexual deviants getting off to some of the weirdest stuff makes the show hilarious, despite the fact it\u2019s trying to give us a message of greed and corruption. It\u2019s an extended metaphor that is given in such a way as to make whatever message it\u2019s sending a joke. Yes, political greed is bad. Yes the country is fucked up. But when you play up the Prime Minister to be absolutely evil then fight him as his head  expands into a giant balloon and his tongue becomes spider legs, your whole message is destroyed.\\n\\n\r\nMetal Gear Solid could throw us messages because, despite the bevy of insane, weird, and otherwise unrealistic characters, there were still human characters and situations we could relate to. And I see a lot of Metal Gear Solid trying to come through here. It just doesn\u2019t work.\\n\\n\r\nThis is an entertaining, dark, and edgy anime. But it\u2019s also not at all as smart as it tries to be, nor as serious. It\u2019s hilarious, it\u2019s weird, and it, ultimately, is one of the strangest things I\u2019ve ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nEspecially Saiga baring his chest to show the ten cameras he has strapped to himself. If ever there were a laughable way to defeat a bad guy, it\u2019s goddam chest cameras.\\n\\n\r\nSuggested.",

            "content": "Oh the 2000\u2019s\u2026 It was a growing period for anime, but produced some of the most gripping series in the history of the medium (Monster, Full Metal Alchemist, Ergo Proxy etc.). It was also a period of time when directors tried new things, for better or for worse and major risks were taken to produce that next \u201cbig\u201d original series.  Produced by the once giant Gonzo studios (Kaze no Stigma, Welcome to the NHK), Speed Grapher tries to push the envelope of an adult anime while making every effort to establish itself as a standalone success. Unfortunately, lofty expectations mixed with inconsistent animation anda sporadic use of themes cause the anime to meander to the point where it loses itself. Simply put, Speed Grapher is what happens when an anime tries to do \u201ctoo\u201d much.\\n\\n\r\nFor story\u2019s sake, Speed Grapher has a solid premise laid out from the get-go. A once acclaimed war photographer, Tatsumi Saiga, decides to investigate the inner-workings of a private club for high ranking Japanese officials in order to help reinvigorate his career. He ends up getting more than he bargained for and becomes tied up in the club\u2019s intimate secrets when he is kissed by a 15 year old girl at one of the parties. The girl, Kagura Tennouzu, has a unique virus dwelling in her body that can be transferred to certain individuals possessing a genetic variant causing mutations. Basically, she accidentally kisses Saiga and now he can blow shit up with his camera. That\u2019s the kind of show we\u2019re talking about here.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime sounded so outlandish that I just had to give it the old college try, and although there were massive hindrances, I enjoyed it overall. The first thing I want to throw out there is that Speed Grapher is absolutely NOT suitable for children. The series is interspersed with adult themes, and incorporates vivid scenes of dismemberment and borderline pornography. Although it didn't get tagged with the \u201cadults only\u201d title, I would strongly advise against anyone under 14 watching this. Unfortunately these lewd scenes are so prevalent that it ends up detracting from the overall experience in Speed Grapher. It's one thing to show shots of ongoing orgies featuring heavyset 50-year-old men when it ties together with the scene (I guess), but it's another to drop them in sporadically. It leaves a bad taste in your mouth, to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the groundwork for the story is quite well written. It features two strong protagonists, each with their own set of goals and morals and plenty of nonstop action and brilliantly paced suspense around every turn. The show\u2019s villain is bad to the core, stopping at nothing to get what he wants\u2026 which of course he initially does. There are a multitude of themes explored in Speed Grapher as well, but due to the sheer number and relatively short air time, most of these ideas become diluted and ineffective. After a promising first few episodes, the series limps to the finish line in the most predictable anime ending of the century. Although so much was attempted, few aspects were actually fully explored or successful. By the end of the series I began to become bored and felt like it drug on into its inevitable conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nThe complexity in dialogue within Speed Grapher is very erratic and inconsistent. One minute they're talking about serotonin levels and brain functionality, and the next they're throwing around four letter vulgar insults and pedophilia references. I'm all for playful conversation, but at least be more consistent. The tumultuous dialogue, mixed with the overwhelming number of ideas explore cause Speed Grapher to fall into a \u201chodgepodge\u201d of sorts, making it harder to understand the overarching message the writers were trying to convey.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter wise, the two mains (Saiga and Kagura) are leagues above everyone else in the series when it comes to development. Saiga is actually a \u201csmart\u201d protagonist, which is hard to come by these days. He is dealt defeat multiple times throughout the series and most of the time isn't rushing to save Kagura with a blind eye (pun intended for those of you who have seen the anime). His motives and justification are made very clearly known and his relationship with Kagura is more of a bond than anything sexual. Fortunately for the viewers, the writers didn't overstep their bounds in trying to make a romance happen between a 15 year old and a 30-somethings washed up photographer. Kagura, in contrast to Saiga is fragile, innocent and pure. She knows nothing about her condition and Saiga does his best to keep it that way. The two play well off each other, taking the damsel in distress concept a bit further than normal. It's interesting to see Kagura\u2019s growth into a more independent woman as opposed to her aimlessness from the beginning of the series. Some of her moments (acting wise) are a bit cliched, but she IS supposed to be a highschooler after all.\\n\\n\r\nOur main villain, Chouji Suitengu is a one-dimensional character on the surface: wanting only money and power to spread his influence. Needless to say it was nice to see his past and motives fleshed out, even though they were somewhat irrational. His acting was superb, and added to the level of mystery immensely. The episodic antagonists each had a small backstory, and starkly unique abilities. It reminded me of Xmen in an odd way, with each of them harboring a strange power only they would have. In the whole scheme of things I don't really care for the one-off approach to characters, and Speed Grapher was full of them\u2026 and it seemed like sometimes the writers were just trying to fill episodes. I was a bit let down that more time wasn't spent getting backgrounds of Suitengu\u2019s henchman, and why they were so loyal to him in the first place. I think there was only about two scenes that expounded on this.\\n\\n\r\nAlright, let's get down to the fatal flaws Speed Grapher has: the animation and the sound. I understand that the anime came out over ten years ago, but there are some straight up sloppy instances of animation here. Disfigured character faces, choppy action scenes and bland background images did not bode well with me at all. I get that the washed spectrum of colors sought to set the atmosphere, but it just didn't translate well for me.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is especially bad. The OP is decent, but the real pain was the misuse of background music throughout the entire anime. I could probably count 8 tracks that were played over and over and over and over and\u2026 well you get the point. The style of music the worked with shows like Gungrave failed miserably here because of their repetitiveness. If you can sing each tune from the OST after watching the series once, they're probably overdoing it a bit. The tracks, in addition to being overused were also too loud, causing the dialogue between characters to be drowned out occasionally. The 2nd ED was perhaps my favorite track of all, and the images were drawn quite well. Best part of the audio? The English dub. It is FAR superior to the Japanese one, and offers much more to the mood due to its noticeable Western influences. Chris Sabat\u2019s role of Saiga was brilliant, and I'm glad to see Justin Cook\u2019s skills on full display here adapting it.\\n\\n\r\nWell, I can say that I really did enjoy Speed Grapher more than I should\u2019ve based on its shortcomings. I'd chalk it up under a \u201ccult classic\u201d or \u201cguilty pleasure\u201d category. It's low brow, vulgar and justice filled, with the standard good guy, bad guy ending we all know so well. I'd recommend this to fans of similar 2000\u2019s shows like Gungrave, Black Lagoon and Darker than Black\u2026 though sadly I don't feel it's technically as good as any of those. Take what I say with a grain of salt, because this could very well be a surprise series for you if you can get past the imperfections. As always, thanks for reading!",

            "content": "Speed Grapher initially seems to have a lot going for it. The plot is semi-episodic, with an overall story arc that binds the individual episodes together. While some people complain about the art, I had no objections there: it is a grim, gritty setting, and the art has a film noir look that fits that setting. Likewise with the sound: while I don't have much to praise about the series's music, I don't have anything to complain about. \r\nWhere it really failed for me was in the category of character. To give the show credit, both the heroes and the villains have well-developed back stories.These are people who have suffered, and it seems like we ought to care about them when they are fail or triumph, as the case may be. And I have to say that the story arcs for all significant characters have satisfying endings: whether the characters live or die, you feel that their stories are wrapped up well. That was one of the things I liked about the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem is that I simply didn't care that much about any of the characters, not even the two central characters. Saiga was a passable hero. In my opinion, he lacked an appealing-enough personality to carry the show on  his own, but he could have worked as a hero given the right pairing. Unfortunately, he was paired with a girl who had virtually no personality at all. Under the circumstances, I wouldn't expect a young girl like Kagura to be a fighter, but she should have at least shown some sense of humor, or charm, or wit, or emotional depth . . . or,  well, anything other than the naive sweetness and vulnerability that characterized her. A sweet, vulnerable heroine is not always a bad thing (such a character can give the hero a reason to protect her), but Kagura needed some additional spark of personality in order to function as a likeable protagonist or a believable potential love interest. \\n\\n\r\nUltimately, this meant that the relationship between the two main characters --which COULD have been one of the strengths of the series--was, from my perspective, shallow and uninteresting. At the end of the series, I was relieved to be done with it, but while I could abstractly note that the finale was a solid one, I just didn't really care about the fates of any of the characters. And, in my book, that's a major failure on the part of the series, given that it tried so hard to develop both villains and protagonists as well-rounded characters. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Story: 8. Pretty interesting story. Kept me on my toes to know what happens next and for that I give it an eight. It didn't give me any chills down my spine that would deserve a 10 but connecting all the stories of Suitengu Saiga and the other characters so well served as a good point.\r\nArt: 8. I love the realistic animation style Gonzo and Asahi used for this series. The action scenes are also pretty good. Could have used more visible wounds though for an R rated anime.\r\nSound: 9. If there is one thing that irritates me about using English in anime it iswhen the English is bad. What stopped this show from getting a 10 (the opening by Duran Duran was sick) was their voicing for the occasional parts in English. I don't know why anime producers can't just get someone actually ENGLISH to do the voicing. Good music though.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime were awesome. You came to love to hate characters like Suitengu and Kagura's mother and get attached to Saiga and Kagura. The side character's are also great: Bob, Ginza, Ryougoku, and Tokoshi are all of Saiga's friends and are great supporting characters. Suitengu's Tsujido, Makabe, and Niihari are great supporting character's as well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9. I really did enjoy this anime. It's dark elements were very interesting (for example the Club) and it was never really boring. Good show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9.",

            "content": "Speed Grapher embodies the spirit of \"close but no cigar\" unlike any other anime I have seen.  The show makes honest attempts at greatness, but it practically feels like various people throughout the creative/production process just said \"fuck it\" and decided to ship out an unpolished product.  That said, there are moments when Speed Grapher truly shines, and are not to be overlooked.\r\nThe story centers around Saiga, a photojournalist who made his big name doing war photography.  When on an assignment as a detective, he discovers an underground club where the rich and powerful indulge in hedonism and depravity.  He endsup in the center of a seemingly occult ritual in which a beautiful girl who the club patrons only refer to as 'Goddess' kisses him, and his life changed forever.\\n\\n\r\nUsing his new-found ability to make things that he takes pictures of explode, he escapes with the Goddess, and swears to save her, get to the bottom of this, and understand his new powers.\\n\\n\r\nIt is from this jumping point that the show starts to try and offer social commentary, to varying degrees of effectiveness.  We quickly learn that the basis of these superpowers is that they have their roots in their wielder's innermost desires i.e. their fetish.  This concept alone is plenty interesting, they way that the series handles the wielders of these powers (referred to as 'Euphorics') could have been better.  Around every two episodes or so we get introduced to a new Baddie of the Week who does something repulsive in their first scene.  They get called on to take down the protagonist, wherein we see that their Euphoric powers are tied to the repulsive thing that they did earlier, possibly as they rant elatedly about their fetish.\\n\\n\r\nWhen combined with the antagonists' speeches on how Euphoric powers are meant to be enjoyed and that to refuse to revel in them is foolish, the takeaway message from it all seems to be 'Sex Is Evil', or at least when wallowed in to the point of having it define your life.   By the end of the series, commentary has turned more to the likes of 'wealth and power corrupt absolutely', which is reiterated at every point possible to the point of losing all sapience.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the best thing about the series is its primary antagonist, who I will avoid filling in too many details about in the name of avoiding spoilers.  However, one thing that I will say was that I found discovering this character's backstory and filling in all the character development that drove them to their current path to be the most interesting and well-thought-out part of the anime.  Even this was not flawless in it's execution, as the final step in the antagonist's plan doesn't make sense and would almost be counterproductive to their primary motivation-- but this short-falling doesn't seem to stem from the character's character so much as from sub-par writing, almost as though the writing team couldn't come up with a better conclusion that would still be dramatic.\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings me to another major issue with the production-- the animation quality.  While some scenes and backgrounds are beautiful, it is easy to tell where the budget went in any given episode.  For every fluidly-rendered fight scene there are three scenes of conversations between off-model faces, lazy foreshortening, and bad collisions.  In stark contrast to many other Gonzo works, such as Gankutsuou and Last Exile, Speed Grapher is anything but eye candy.\\n\\n\r\nAll that negativity aside, I rate Speed Grapher as a solid 7/10 because even for all the flaws it was still an enjoyable and compelling watch.",

            "content": "I was on the lookout for as mature anime series - mature in the sense of gritty and adult themed plot - and following some surfing I found this gem - Speed Grapher.\r\nOnce the I saw the opening with Duran Duran's Girls on Film, I knew I would like this. The idea of the main character using his camera as a weapon was an interesting concept, kind of reminded me of the horror PS2 game Project Zero (Fatal Frame), and although this series has slight horror by the way of various monsters making their entrance in the show, I felt this series to be moreof a action drama. \\n\\n\r\nThe relationship between Saiga and Kagura was sweet and core to the series. It was his teachings to Kagura about the reality of the world which was interesting to watch and you can really see their affinity for each other grow as the series progresses. However it was the villain Sitengu who stole the show for me, after seeing his background and motivations in what he is doing and I personally felt - good on him and hope he succeeds, which to have that kind of feeling for the villain for the peice proved to me that this was good story. YOu even start to have feelings for his back up crew of villains, which again I have only seen in Black Lagoon.\\n\\n\r\nI did feel however the series did become a monster of the week scenario, and the series could have been shorter, but its a TV series so I think we all have to live with this!\\n\\n\r\nFan fave - Ginza was welcome humour relief to the series, however she was a much needed contrast and flip side of the coin in protection Saiga. It was nice to see that similarity portrayed. Plus she fulfilled a guys fantasy of taking control of some situations - if you know what i mean! ;)\\n\\n\r\nWith regards to the sexual themes, were they required? I think this aspect is where Speed Grapher was trying too hard to aim for its intended mature audience, and could've been handled better, but I think it was probably a way of enticing people to watch the series,m thankfully it didn't interfer with the story. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation wise - not as good as Gonzo could be, but not that bad that it effects enjoyment. Sound track wise - fiited the series well, but nothing too memorable that makes you want to OST. \\n\\n\r\nAt 24 episodes not much of investment of time, and if you do like a dark gritty character driven story, and you dont mind some OTT, give Speed Grapher a go, especially past episode 4 where it starts to shine. \\n\\n\r\nAn overall 8/10.\\n\\n",

There were some very beautiful scenic or sky backrounds that took my breath away, but there wasn't anything especially brilliant.\r\nThe sound was also pretty good, I think. I really enjoyed the opening theme song.\r\nThe characters were outstanding. Every villian was great with their own different power. I was always amazed at the powersthey came up with and couldn't wait to see what the next villian could do. The main characters were also outstanding, all with their own personalities and features.\\n\\n\r\nThis is not an anime for kids though, because there were some sex scenes, all though they never really lasted more than a few seconds. It wasn't for hentai reasons and it helped add to the story.\\n\\n\r\nSpeed Grapher was the perfect mix of violence, hate, friendship, and love. It was dark and deep.

            "content": "This anime was, for lack of a better word, weird. There\u00a0are\u00a0a lot of\u00a0anime\u00a0that are strange, but they're usually trying to be deeply philosophical or artistic, touch some weird topics, or forcing themselves to be weird. This doesn't really fall into any of these categories. While in some sense it does try to make some philosophical points, these are pretty superficial, and pretty simplistic. While it certainly does have some scenes that have a good amount of artistic flair, that still isn't at the core of why this show is strange. It also does have some strange topics, mostly how degenerate people can be, but thatjust feels like a part of why\u00a0it's\u00a0strange. Furthermore, the strangeness never feels forced, and that's why how weird it is\u00a0is\u00a0so striking, because there's no specific thing that makes it so strange, but rather everything comes together to be really strange. For example, the\u00a0individual\u00a0powers being tied to strange desires is somewhat weird, but if it went full battle anime it probably wouldn't be that strange. But it doesn't, rather it keeps things fairly grounded even when these\u00a0powers\u00a0get completely\u00a0ridiculous.\u00a0The scenes showcasing depravity or\u00a0showing the rich and powerful as degenerates wouldn't\u00a0be so weird if that seemed to be the point of the anime, but rather, they just seem to be the backdrop, which makes it more likely to make the viewer uncomfortable I'd say.\u00a0Just\u00a0all around, there's a lot\u00a0individually\u00a0and in combination that makes it super strange, and that's certainly not a bad thing. Rather, I'd say that it's one of the best things, in that it keeps things super interesting.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of plot, the core plot is basically Saiga simply trying to save\u00a0Kaguya. However, this is made difficult by the real plot driver, which is\u00a0Suitengu\u00a0and his machinations that require\u00a0Kaguya. This plot does a really good job with characters. The main heroes, Saiga and\u00a0Kaguya, have a strange relationship, but they come across really well after all they go through. Other side characters such as Ginza and Bob also feel important enough to matter, and ultimately come across just as well.\u00a0A real strength with this show though, is that the core cast of villains\u00a0is\u00a0great, though not in terms of having super\u00a0sympathizable\u00a0backstories or goals the viewer can sympathize with. Rather,\u00a0Suitengu's\u00a0goal doesn't really seem to be anything beyond simply achieving revenge on the world. But still, they come across as human characters, with depth, and ultimately have an air to them that makes them seem cool despite everything. This is emphasized by the fact that there are also another\u00a0group\u00a0of villains, basically the politicians, who serve somewhat as a foil in that they're incredibly easy to hate. The various side\u00a0Euphoriacs\u00a0were also interesting, in that\u00a0their\u00a0power seemed to delve into the core of who they are, which was strange, but certainly made good characters. Ultimately, all of this drives the plot at a good pace, slowly building things up to a massive scale ending, which was strange, in that both the villain and heroes seem to win, in that their ultimate goals in the end weren't entirely incompatible, and hence even though there is a tremendous disaster, it ends on a somewhat happy\u00a0lighthearted\u00a0note that was reasonably satisfying.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation were really good and there were a lot of good action and artistic shots. The OP for the first half had an interesting concept of basically being a recap, with each episode having a different one, which I thought worked well. The song was completely random but I suppose it worked. The OP for the second half used the same song for a standard OP, but also had great and memorable visuals. The soundtrack was really good with a number of really memorable tracks. Overall the sense of\u00a0style\u00a0and atmosphere created was really good.\u00a0\u00a0\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr: A show that comes together to be very bizarre but still works really well.",

            "content": "The story follows the exploits of former war photographer Tatsumi Saiga, who is on the trail a secret fetish club for the ultra-wealthy called the Roppongi Club where politicians, media moguls and industry CEOs meet to indulge in primal and deprived fantasies and everything from sexual fulfillment to torturing someone to death is possible. He tries to photograph the club's \"goddess,\" a 15-year-old exploited girl named Kagura, but is discovered. But instead of killing him, she kisses him, and the photographer gains a strange new power from that kiss: everything he takes a photo of explodes\u2026 \r\nMy thoughts:\r\nThis is an interesting series that contains alot of nudity and sexual references so I don\u2019t recommend it for those under the age of 16. It depicts the greed in human nature; what people will do to get what they want. The action in the story is really just the encounters Saiga has with the \u2018monster of the week\u2019 that show up to stop him and grab the girl. Although sometimes the villain of the story is to be hated, I found that I liked Suitengu and his three loyal goons. What happened in his life is what shaped him and though you\u2019re sure of what he\u2019ll do; he surprises you when he does something totally out of character. If you like dark, gritty and the hardcore side of anime, then you\u2019ll enjoy Speed Grapher.",

            "content": "Story 5: We have a pretty standard storyline with a few spurts of originality. Basically the male protagonist and the female protagonist are on the run from an evil organization. Oh and some people have super powers. As you can imagine the protagonists have to hide from/kill a whole horde of henchmen while learning about the organization and how they fit into it. Around the halfway mark things just fizzle out. It\u2019s not even like they start up a lame new story arc\u2026they continue the first one with no new ideas. This series could have been 12 episodes long. This anime is watchable ONLY ifyou\u2019ve seen everything else in this genre already. \\n\\n\r\nStory pros:\\n\r\n-Some of the characters have pretty cool super powers. The main bad guy\u2019s power is awesome.\\n\r\n-There are some really twisted themes in here that try to explore the depths of human depravity. Money is portrayed as an all-powerful corruptive force that runs the world, while the elite are portrayed as hedonistic monsters who live only to sate their dark, perverse fantasies (in this anime they are usually violent, sexual or both). There are definitely more than a few WTF moments..\\n\\n\r\nStory cons: \\n\r\n-Some of the characters have pretty lame super powers. The second in command bad guy\u2019s power is a great sense of smell\u2026there\u2019s a bit more but he\u2019s pretty much useless. \\n\r\n-They have this habit of randomly cutting to flashbacks without warning the audience. I appreciate the attempt at developing a backstory but it sometimes takes a few minutes for you to go \u201cohhh, this is in the past\u201d\u2026usually after you see an already-dead character come on screen. \\n\r\n-There are definitely dead spots in this anime where nothing is really happening. There will be long car rides with Saiga and Kagura and you\u2019ll think \u201cthis is a great opportunity for a conversation and character development\u201d\u2026then Kagura falls asleep in her chair.\\n\r\n-One episode is SHAMELESS filler. It\u2019s the worst filler episode I\u2019ve seen. They play 15 minutes of old scenes (usually explosion/action) scenes and tally up the monetary damage as they go along. \\n\\n\r\nArt 5: Weakest part of the show. The animations look pretty dingy and cheap. Maybe it adds to the whole \u201cgritty\u201d feel but it feels dated and sloppy. And oh god I want to shoot myself whenever they show a scene with mist or smoke (there are a bunch of them). It makes the screen look like a giant smudge.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7: I felt like the music was not too memorable. What stood out (in kind of a bad way) was their frequent use of English in the anime (the Japanese version). As much as I dislike listening to English dubs, I really, really hate it when Japanese voice actors attempt to do either American and European accents. I\u2019ve never seen it done well and it always makes me cringe. This anime may be the worst case of it. Jesus, there were at least 2 episodes with 10+ minutes each of \u201cEnglish\u201d dialogue. It wasn\u2019t pretty. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 6: The leads were boring. Saiga is your classic, gruff, tough, scruffy male protagonist\u2026the type of dude who\u2019s burnt out, drinks more than he should and probably has PTSD. His past as a war photographer is interesting but I felt like they didn\u2019t develop him enough. By the end of the series I still wasn\u2019t quite sure what he was all about. Kagura was also kind of disappointing. She lacked any emotional depth and pretty much stayed a pawn for the entire series. The romance story was also done wrong. The ages are just too far apart. Saiga looks 30+ and acts like a broken down old man while Kagura is 15 and is basically a na\u00efve child. I feel like the series didn\u2019t quite know whether to make Kagura a girlfriend, sister or daughter figure to Saigas. For most of us, these are mutually exclusive roles so it was just weird to see them interact in some scenes. Ex: (Saiga to Kagura) \u201cYou haven\u2019t even lived half as long as I have!\u201d wtf do I make of that?. I thought Suitengu (bad guy) was very cool as a character and had complexity and an engaging back story.  All of his scenes were interesting. Despite his depth, he and Saiga didn\u2019t really click well as enemies and there wasn\u2019t any of that synergy between foes (i.e. like in Death Note or Psycho Pass). In essence they didn\u2019t make each other shine. One more thing. I\u2019m a fan of the Yandere character archetype and I feel like the series missed a real opportunity with Ginza. I mean she is psychotic, a police officer, in love with Saiga, and prefers using lethal force over making an arrest. She could have had a much more interesting an influential part in the series than the always-one-step-behind the action role that she got.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 6.5: I realized what this series was a few episodes into it and I continued to watch it for the hell of it. I didn\u2019t hate this series but it left me feeling irritated and unimpressed.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 5: Just not enough substance to keep me entertained or caring about what would happen next.\\n\\n\r\nViolence/Gore: lots of blood and killing. If you want that then this may be the anime\u2019s salvation. Usually something fucked up or violent every episode\\n\r\nLove/Romance: They tried to stitch something together but it came out forced and creepy. I would have gone with Ginza.\\n\r\nSex/Nudity: yes. Lots of bizarre sexual situations. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Want a taste of 80s inspired action, that also manages to hold itself together and have earnest character drama and development? Well, look no further, for this wild ride of a series will satisfy your entertainment needs in every aspect you can ask for. As a Gonzo show, it has sexual themes, romantic themes, revenge, justice, tragedy, conviction, conspiracy, thrill, adventure, sci-fi and all the like. It's a lot for a show to handle but the way it weaves its narrative, along with episodic villains to spice things up, it comes out with some very good pacing, making for an enjoyable binge experience, once youget past its exploitation film aspirations that is. Thus, a true action series with an earnest heart of gold underneath! Oh, and WATCH THE DUB, it's very good and takes great advantage of the obvious western influence of the series, on top of not sounding as self-serious, which helps emphasize the fun aspects more.\\n\\n\r\nThe storyline beyond the synopsis flows very naturally with only a few stumbles along the way, where the pacing is slowed down, looking for material to keep going, only to then move on to setting up the last, pivotal, climactic arc. I cannot overstate how it managed to hook me for an entire day, always leaving the right amount of questions open, with equally rewarding answers. \\n\r\nBut, as a show with many spices, it also includes monster-of-the-week type villains, all of which have their own creepy atmosphere surrounding them. They are all given just enough screen time to seem like true adversaries to Saiga. For whatever minor plot details are left hanging or unresolved, you don't care because the show has moved smoothly enough by keeping tabs on Kagura and Saiga, and later on: the antagonist Suitengu. These three characters make up the heart and soul of Speed Grapher.\\n\r\nThe many, many themes in Speed Grapher are tied very closely to the characters, forming their motives in a believable fashion, creating a grounded world of absurdist realism, not unlike a superhero film with complicated themes. There are more hyperbolic extremes than metaphors, which fits so much better in the essence of an action show that isn't afraid to step into schlock, yet also be earnest in its character drama and development. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is rough on the eyes. The western dark urban aesthetic isn't pleasant, but it also shows ghetto alleys and slums. But we also get out of the city quite a few times, so there absolutely is variety in setting and color palette, even if it's washed out most of the time. It serves as a great background to BLOW SHIT UP, regardless of it. The designs are made to be realistic and move smoothly, yet there are no comedic scenes to where you get other versions of said designs. This would ruin its noir grounded tone. However that doesn't stop the show from having a humor about itself, be quirky and accentuate its weirdness when the time is right.\\n\r\nAction cinematography isn't to be underestimated either, a lot of the close up cuts are done in a thrilling fashion to where it's entertaining to watch, yet economical for production. It's most obvious in the monster of the week battles as well. While the dramatic close ups don't overdo it, to where you see the rough cel lines of a character model, it's kept snappy where it needs to be, yet also underlines a dramatic moment just right, in whatever ridiculous circumstance. And that's not to take away from the creative, yet also tactically savvy skirmishes.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is servicable, keeps tension and pressure when needed. Lightens the mood during downtime. Accentuates the BOOMING action with joy and glory. Everything you need a good ost a audio design to do, especially the tension soundtrack, it works very well for the moments it is picked and is in my head since the climax of episode 1. But the bigger credit here should go to the Funimation dubbing team. They uplifted the material into a whole new territory where it doesn't feel as dry or as self-serious as the Japanese voicing. There's a better, softer, and equally somber flow to the American English, and even if it is set in Tokyo and its surroundings, the noir urban atmosphere, along with the 80s action and exploitation film influence it fits like a glove. Kagura doesn't need to sound like a squeaky school girl, she is 16 after all. Saiga is just as impassioned and badass, while Suitengu captures every frame he is in with his charming presence that makes you tingle, with his buttery smooth voice.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, oh, the characters. Saiga in a lot of ways is your shounen protagonist. Yet as an adult he is free to be proactive as much as he goddamn wants, and less reactive to the plot. He IS a driving force quite a few times throughout the show, and every time it is backed by an impassioned, idealistic motive of his that is pure in spirit. He is the reason why I would call this show an adult shounen, due to him representing ideals of righteousness and especially freedom, be it from materialistic or spiritualistic bonds. He isn't cocky, and fights when he needs to, not when he pleases. He runs away from overwhelming forces, but is not afraid to push forward the mystery behind his newly acquired powers. A war journalist at heart, seeking an intense experience that enables him do everything in the show. He feels alive, but you also see what he's like before we got to the juicy action he craves for subconsciously.\\n\r\nKagura is quite the intriguing character. She in aspects embodies the angsty teen, but as she becomes unsheltered and embraces the sweet smell of freedom, slowly becomes something much more than a damsel in distress plot device. At the end of her journey, she is shown to be her own, independent woman. Not afraid to take rash action and control. Doesn't play the \"I'm sheltered\" gimmick for too long, but naturally she feels guilty for her own powers within her that essentially are the basis for the plot. \\n\\n\r\nAnd finally Suitengu. This guy may remind you of Sepphiroth, but trust me he is his own person as well. He is more than a mercenary, ruthless capitalist, he has an underlined, pervasive charm than that. One of the most amazing turnarounds is his backstory, providing new thematic avenues worthy of the final arc that's all about him. Why he treasures Kagura on a personal level and wants her back at any cost. In the end he is not the true foil to Saiga, but rather someone who takes freedom in a completely different direction. One that is ever so personal, yet grand at the same time. He is truly a memorable and supremely villain that you come to respect throughout and at the climactic end of the series. \\n\\n\r\nNotable supporting characters include Mrs Tennouzu and Ginza. Mrs Tennouzu is more of a background story filler character, she has her own sets of characteristics and mysteries that are revealed over time, also fleshing out her behavior and her approach to politics, how she acquired her position in the story. \\n\r\nInspector Ginza is obsessed with Saiga, but not in a healthy way, nor is he recipient of it. In a lot of ways she may remind you of Revy from Black Lagoon, albeit less aggressive and more sensual. She gets her own subtle development over time, yet still manages to hold screen presence as an essential support character that follows the plot with the viewer. \\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment of the series doesn't only come from how bingable it is. But, for the earnest storytelling it offers. The explanations it provides satisfy the autist in me just enough. The twists and turns of the story hit all the right notes. The monster of the week battles never felt like they interfere with previous plot establishments. They accentuate what began as schlock entertainment. It's a main dish of action with lots of different spices that give it a distinct taste of its own that is astringently sweet. The sex and BDSM imagery is an aesthetic I'm completely unphased by, for the show manages to handle all its tones with a masterful stroke, whether its absurd or dramatic. But above all, I respect the show for being honest to the ore with what it is: entertainment. \\n\r\nIt is not here for any huge twist to present a perspective of life, nor is it insulting to my intelligence in providing a sloppy plot with flimsy motivations and dark twists for their own sake. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I loved my time with this show. But due to its inherent nature as a purely entertainment action series, with no aspirations for anything higher, which in turn takes to its advantage all the way. Including a satisfying epilogue conclusion to everyone's arcs and plot threads after all is said and done. So you can safely invest in this experience and come out satisfied at the end. Assuming you enjoy bizarre superpowers, schlock overtones and monster of the week battles. Who knows, this might just be the close up you've been wanting.",

            "content": "As 22 yr old uni student, its a core anime to watch in my top ten list. This show is mean for adult audience with action, blood, nudity and truely great to sit back and enjoy. Nowadays, there is no more fine piece like this and monster, Steingate anime anymore. Truely recommand for mature audience, not for kids. Suitengu starts up this society, then the photographer guy, Saiga, crashes the party, gets kissed by the girl with the power-giving powers, Kagura, gets his powers to kill/explode things through his camera lens, and then kidnaps the girl and kills a bunch of richies as he makeshis break for freedom. Then the chase begins. This is a multi-angled chase too. Suitengu's boys are after Saiga and Kagara; Saiga and Kagara are after relics of both their pasts; and Saiga's domineering S&M fuck buddy, police detective Ginza, is after her boytoy in order to keep him all to herself. Then the show becomes a bit like Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon in that it becomes \"He's got the sword.. Now the other guy has the sword.... Now he's got it back again... No, wait, now somebody else has the sword!\" Only instead of \"sword\" I mean \"weak-willed, rich, little, persecuted, teenage girl named Kagara.\" It doesn't get tedious, and quite frankly it does advance the plot; it just seems like they could have done something more interesting. Whatever. It's just, wow, really strange to make this show seem somewhat normal in this review. Because it is as bizarro a show as one could imagine. Strange. Very strange. Imagine watching Terry Gilliam's Brazil or Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas for the first time when you're 3 years old, and that's kind of like what this show is like to an adult with the mind of a child (i.e. me and people like me).",

            "content": "Here's my first review... \r\nSpeed Grapher, an anime mostly about  money, abuse of power and more money. Overall it's very darktoned and dramatic. Not my kind of thing but I decided to watch it anyway. \r\nStory: 7\r\nA girl, Kagura, is drugged and used to pleasure rich politicians. Then a famous photographer, Saiga, gets caught up in it and decides he wants to save the girl. \r\nThe main story is that of Kagura and Saiga. Infected with a virus (at least I think it is a virus) they try to save themselves while escaping from the aristocrats who try to capture them. \r\nBehind this thereis a deeper story which centers on the \"dirty politicians\" and messed up society we live in. Though showing their good face to the citizens, these politicians abuse their power to achieve money and sexual pleasure. \\n\r\nIt's not my thing, but it portrays reality pretty good. \\n\r\nThen there also is the supernatural part in which people turn into maniacs who basically have orgasms collecting human legs, eating diamonds or bouncing around like tennis balls.  I hoped the story would center more on the virus which inflicts these crazy habits and abilities, but it didn't. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 5\\n\r\nDidn't like it. Very little color, but I suppose that goes with the dark tone the anime has. Little time was spend on the caracter design. They only one I enjoyed watching was Tsujido. \\n\r\nDon't remember the backgrounds too well so I guess they weren't too special either.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4 \\n\r\nAt the beginning the music was nice. The fact that they only used 3 tracks in the entire anime bothered me. \\n\r\nOpening was nice, so is the video that goes with it. The first ending was horrible, Shione Yukawa just can't sing. Luckily halfway the series they save us by changing the ending song to another, much better, one. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7 \\n\r\nThey are good characters, Saiga, Kagura, Suitengu, Tsujido... Very distinct, each with a fixed goal to achieve. They are all quite powerful characters. Kagura I liked least, she's so manipulative, running behind anyone depending on how she feels. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\r\nIf you like this kind of drama you'll probably enjoy it a lot more then I did. It's a story about reality like we all know it. I see it every day so I don't have to see it in an anime too. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6 \\n\r\nIt's a good anime, has a lot of drama and criticizes society. It also has quite a bit of supernatural events to make things more interesting. If I would be neutral about my preferences in anime I would probably give this an 8. But I expected a more supernatural-based anime, which I didn't get, hence the 6. \\n\r\nIf you're looking for a dramatic view on society however, you'll probably enjoy this very much.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Speed Grapher is about a man named Saiga. Saiga is a photojournalist who's seen it all. He is well known for being a war photographer. He now lives in Tokyo doing regular photo work and is completely disappointed with his work, until one night he stumbles into a secret club where he finds some of the darkest most disturbing truths about the world around him. But amongst the grim he find's the beautiful girl which to him instantly becomes the perfect subject for his camera. All hell breaks loose and Saiga now finds himself with a new disturbing power which he can't explain and theyoung female who doesn't understand what's going on either. They end up running for their lives while trying to solve the mystery behind Saiga's powers and the girls connection to the club and what it all means for the city.\\n\\n\r\nStory: The story is well told and very complex. This anime does a great job of showing some of the more disturbing sides of life. You can actually walk away with a wider perspective of some of the ways people in this world actually think.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is very sharp  and crisp. The scenery changes quite a bit giving you different contrast in colors so that you're not always looking at the same thing.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The music and sound of the anime is good but probably one of the weaker points not because it is bad but more because it really doesn't stand out much on its own at any point.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Other than the main character's, you'll meet a new character every episode. It's unique in the fact even in just a 30 minute episode the creators do a great job of letting you understand the new character's quite well before the end of the episode. The main character's are very well explained through the show, you're constantly learning something new about them while you watch the story progress.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: While you're constantly wondering what's going to happen next. You'll also be trying to understand the world in where this is all taking place as and get a handle on it. It's definitely a suspenseful show that does a great job of making you sit back and think about the world around you.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I'd recommend this show to anyone that like's a interesting story but its definitely at an off beat pace. Be forewarned though, this anime delves into the sick and perverse side of human lives, so you'll see a couple slightly disturbing imagines depending on how sensitive you are to said scenes. But the show tells a great story which gives some good insight to life.",

And the lyrics... \"I'm all jittery like a horse's tail\"? That's, like, the worst simile ever. The opening theme is fantastic, though, and the dubbing simply kicks ass.

Like the gun-toting detective woman you'll meet in episode one. You think you have her figured out, but then in the third volume it turns out she's more than meets the eye.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This is a nine only because I don't like Tsujido (sp?). Just plain don't like him. Yeah you are probably saying that should go under 'Character', but I don't enjoy this character... I found out his voice is Greg Ayres, and that might be why I dislike him.\\n\r\nOverall: MUST SEE.",

            "content": "Studio Gonzo has developed a reputation for making some questionable anime. The anime ranges from a rare hit to some of the worst rated anime ever. However, Gonzo tends to make average anime at best usually. Does Speed Grapher fit the mold though? More notable then the main director is the guy who was involved in many aspects of the show: Co-director, episode- and animation- director, key animation, and even character design; Masashi Ishihama was clearly determined to make his mark on making Speed Grapher a success.\r\nOur main character is Saiga Tatsumi. He is an ex-war photographer and his current case is following the trailof a secret club in high end Japanese society. As a freelancer, he uses his old war skills and his determination to get into this secret club. There he discovers this club strives to get the member to enjoy their deepest sexual desires ranging from bondage sex to torture. Of course, Saiga gets caught, but is strangely sacrificed to their \u201cgoddess.\u201d Instead of killing him, Saiga is kissed by the goddess and somehow granted powers based on his most sexual desire, everything he takes a picture of explodes.\\n\\n\r\nSpeed Grapher does some things right and at the time, has not been seen in anime for a while. The plot is pretty interesting which makes for a decent story overall. It even places an intriguing take on society in a setting that has pretty good atmosphere. Saiga is a good character that has the right motivations, but so do the few side characters as well. However well the show starts out and no matter how much action takes place, Speed Grapher quickly falls into a long loop of \u201cmonster-of-the-week\u201d syndrome. Sure, the antagonists known as Euphoria are fairly memorable with their interesting designs and small backgrounds. Unfortunately, this drags on and puts the plot on hold. Even the \u201cgoddess\u201d which was interesting at first suffers from damsel in distress disease constantly and quickly wears on the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter designs are pretty bland even for 2005. Even the art just lacks so much detail along with chopped up animation. This hurts the action sequences in the show no matter how cool they may be. The over-top-villains with the evil society made the plot go on, and watching Saiga\u2019s struggle seemed real. Again however, this is even thrown to the curb by a very lack-luster ending making the viewer wish something else would have happened.\\n\\n\r\nThis could have been a great series, but so much seemed half-way done. Maybe so much was lost in animation and dragging the series along this just does not live up to a good action show, but an average one at best. It has originality, but is poorly thought out and executed overall.",

            "content": "speed grapher it's good because it shows you the world we're living now, and criticice the capitalism. Some scenes, like the desesperate ones who can't pay the menbership of the tennouzu group, are a good example of the well-construct critic. Despite it was released in 2005, the economical themes are just what happened in the last years. Unfortunately, some stuff bring the quality of this series down: the animation is mediocre and looks old, but it wouldn't be a excuse to don't give a try to this series. The characters give me different impressions: Saiga is a good main character, but Kagura, despite she startedfine, lacks in character development. The best characters, along Ginza, the cool police woman, are the villains, Suitengu, Tsujido, Makabe and Ginji, they're cool, and it the end of the show they really feel human. Others, like Bob, act too steryotipical. And then the Euphoria...some of them are really memorable, like Lady Diamond, other are just weird and perverted dudes the main couple has to defeat, and really forgeteable.\\n\r\nMy recommendation: give it a try, just for the social, political and economic themes, the show deserved it.",

            "content": "First and foremost, don't try and think too much while watching this anime. You'll damage your brain in how much it goes up and down with the characters ever changing views of each other. It doesn't do a horrible job conveying a villainous plot, but it doesn't do a good job either.\r\nSpeed Grapher has a very abstract story line. It sometimes gets confusing and changes pace quite often but it doesn't entirely make it a bad anime. While throughout the most of it's slow paced moments, it leaves you wanting so many answers for things and it takes its sweet time to answer them, sometimesnot answering them all. at about two, thirds through, It gets to the point where it seems like the writers didn't know what else to do. So they just made up new, odd powers and gave them random people. But none of them survive past 2 battle encounters with the main character, which makes Europhein fights almost bores you.\\n\\n\r\nArt is easily sub par. characters lack proper emotion in their animation, and too often you can easily distinguish static backdrops from animated pieces. Colour palates are most times dark making everything dull. The lighting with tones and shades never really added much to the scenes them selves as most times it wouldn't have changed the mood regardless of time of day.\\n\\n\r\nSound is the toughest category of this anime as it had some really good original pieces however it reused the same ones far too many times. Occasionally even adding famous music pieces. It lacks sound in some places where there really should be, making it seems like its either jumped a mute section or they cut corners with their sound budget.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development can be confusing as at one point the main female character hates her mother and the main antagonist, another moment she cries and almost does a complete 180 on her feelings to them. The main villain seems to have no real goal at the beginning apart from wanting to rule everything but at the end it's revealed everything that was though about him was wrong. It's a  decent development but it really does your head in.\\n\\n\r\nOverall enjoyment isn't terribly high, as mentioned in the sound, it plays some of its original pieces way too much to the point where it ruins what could have been a  good feels or action scene. Some episodes are good enough to make you re think a few of your opinions while others seem to drag on pointless aspects with added important factors that almost make you have to watch the fillers so you don't miss something.",

            "content": "\"Speed Grapher\" is a near-future sci-fi anime from Gonzo that is at times lurid, perverted, nihilistic, gory and vulgar, but that's all part of its deliberate \"charm\". What we have here is a \"chase, capture, escape\" action thriller that has been given the sort of glossy superficial trashiness that we haven't seen much of since sci-fi magazines of the 70's, while at the same time the story is, at its heart, an odd mix of romance, lust and longing.\r\nTatsumi Saiga, a famous but now burned-out war photographer who has recently recovered from near fatal wounds from his last assignment, stumbles upon a true \"den ofiniquities\" in Tokyo where the rich and powerful in Japan get to taste the most forbidden of pleasures, and if they are chosen, get to have their innermost dreams made real by a kiss from a \"goddess\".  Saiga unintentionally gets kissed by the young \"goddess\", who tearfully asks Saiga to save her. That kiss changes Saiga into a \"Euphoria\", a monstrous being whose innermost wish has now turned into a terrible reality. In Saiga's case, his \"wish come true\" means that now when he \"shoots a photo\", his camera truly \"shoots\" the target with varying amounts of destructive power. \\n\\n\r\nSaiga is not the only person to have been transformed into the \"Euphoria\" state. There are many others out there who now have unimaginable powers of cruelty and destruction and they are sent after Saiga after he becomes obsessed with answering the plea for help from Kagura, the young \"goddess\", who is the powerless pawn of her fabulously wealthy and powerful mother Shinsen and her mother's aid and lover Suitenguu. Add to this set-up a slew of baroquely conceived characters, animation that occasionally approaches a dreamlike quality, and a jazzy sound track and you have a dark and sometimes subtly humorous bit of fast-action brain candy that doesn't take itself too seriously and is consistently entertaining. Never-the-less, \"Speed Grapher\" is not for all tastes and this is a case where \"viewer discretion\" is definitely advised. \\n",

            "content": "This anime is truly an unforgettable anime. While there are many anime that I've watched where I go, \"Yay, this seems like an interesting anime!\" then at the end go, \"...Well, that was okay, I guess. Next!\" and completely proceed to forget about it, this anime does not fall into that category. Even the next morning, I found myself still thinking of the intricacies, of the plot, of what-ifs that could have happened, of what things that could have been done differently. Oh, and even though this is an anime, I actually cried at the end. It's that good.\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nThis is one of those veryfew anime which actually get you hooked even midway into the first episode. There have been many anime where I've stopped midway because it was moving too slowly, or even more anime where it just fails to get more exciting or get a move on even after five episodes. For me, this anime was paced beautifully, not too much action or dialogue in one episode, and telling just enough to not get you confused yet keep you interested enough that you HAVE to watch the next episode. The plot and the way it was carried was as interesting as every bit it sounded, and just overall amazingly carried out. It did not feel rushed nor did it feel slow, and this is actually one of those anime which I've watched all 24 episodes straight (yes, 12 hours straight) because every time I try to leave it for the next day, I just HAVE to peek at the next episode and end up watching the whole thing. In fact, the only warning I have is that if you don't want to lose sleep by watching this 12 hours straight, then don't even watch until you have the time to do so, because I GUARANTEE you, you will NOT be able to put this down once you've started it.\\n\\n\r\nWhat interested me the most is the balance of action and \"lay-low\" scenes in the whole anime. Also, the battles that they face are not like any of those random battles in other anime that are added in there just for the sake of it: every battle they face actually has a significant contribution to the overall plot and are all stepping stones to finding out more about the true nature of Japan. And what I really like the most? They've manage to turn a cliche-type plot into something that was interesting, dramatic, and so well-woven together that there was no room for fillers. Every theme is present in this anime: revenge, corruption, seeking justice in an unjust society, money, power, politics... You name it, they have it. And most of all, this cliche-type plot that they have, they have managed to turn into a mind-boggling anime that will make you think about it long after you have finished the entire series (in one sitting, I guarantee you).\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nI am not a big fan of the art simply because the lighting, for me, was too dark. I suppose it adds to the mood of the story, and it works fantastically, but there are times where the art looked like it was hurriedly drawn, or times when some of them looked a little bit deformed. The art looked kind of... 2D-ish, for me, though the art was not really so much of an obstruction to keep me from watching it, because the exciting story and plot twists just keep you from even noticing how badly drawn something is. And this is coming from someone who is very picky with anime art.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nSimply because there was nothing memorable about the background music or the opening and ending themes. But this might be because the music blended in so beautifully with the action on-screen that I didn't notice it. Either way, it's a fair score.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nJust the occupation of the main character should be enough to draw you in: a war photographer. Now that's something interesting, something that hasn't been focused on too much before. Now, this may be a little biased since I am a politics/war junkie (yes, despite me being a girl), but it really is something new. His personality is just as beautiful as well. While you would expect a cynical, overly angry tough guy who in reality really just wants someone to hold him close and love him, such a stereotypical personality for a character with an occupation like his is NOT at all present. In fact, he is quite a mysterious man and doesn't open up, but at the same time, he is not this overly angry person who pushes everyone away and refuses their help just because of his pride. He is a balance of mystery and seclusion and also loving and generous who does not want anyone important to him harmed. What I love about him, too, is that even though he is a tough guy, he knows when he needs help, and takes that help. I don't like characters who are overly proud, and he is not one of those typical angry tough guys.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the one I did not like very much is Kagura. She seems like the typical \"oh, I want to do something/ help you with this, but I'm so weak I can't do anything and end up getting captured all the time\" type of damsel in distress. Sure, I appreciate her efforts and her thoughts, but it's most of the time her fault why Tatsumi gets into danger/ has to put himself in danger. Her determination is truly admirable, but at points where Tatsumi has sacrificed everything for her and she chooses to give up... just irks me. I don't like girls who are overly weak and can't do anything like her, and yet because of their wanting to help, they just make the situation worse. She seems like a very common character, and nothing about her stands out.\\n\\n\r\nThere was one woman I really liked in that anime, though, and it was Ginza. Now there's a woman: tough, and can handle herself. While I was kind of annoyed at first that all she cares about is Saiga and doesn't realize just how many lives she is jeopardizing, and coupled with her attitude towards murders waving them off as if they were just another thing on her to-investigate list, the way her outlook in life changes once she has seen the full-blown corruption of all the higher people in Japan coupled with the fact that she is able to finally let go of Tatsumi once she realizes that he really doesn't love her and won't ever love her because of Kagura, made her one of my favorite characters. She is not the overly annoying type of stalker nor is she the overly tough woman who can defend herself against anything. And that's what's beautiful about the characters of Speed Grapher overall- they are not complete Mary or Gary Sues. Tatsumi, just because he has a camera that can explode things, is not overly powerful or undefeated. Ginza, just because she has guns and can shoot a pinhole from 200000000 miles away, does not mean she manages to get a headshot at anyone and everyone she meets. They all have a balance of good traits and bad traits, strengths and weakness, and for me that is just amazing.\\n\\n\r\nAnd Suitengu is your typical bad guy: badass, calm, collected, and smokes REAL money. NOT. Unlike most bad guys in anime, he actually HAS a purpose for doing all the things he's doing, not just because he's evil and he likes to bring harm to other people or anything like that. Of course, I won't tell you just what is his real purpose, you just have to find out for yourself. And also, he has an interesting plot twist concerning Saiga as well, but again, I'm not going to say what it is.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nLike I said, this is one anime that you will never put down once you've started watching it. I enjoyed every single episode, and there was never one where I went \"ho-hum, this is starting to get really boring\". And if there ever was a filler episode, I didn't notice one. For me, everything blended well into each other perfectly, and there is nothing I would want changed in this anime, plot-wise. Though the art could have been better.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is truly a balanced, well-created masterpiece. If you want an anime that will strike a sensitive cord, or an anime that will make you think, then this anime is just for you.",

It was like nothing I'd ever watched at the time, not because it was \"edgy\" or trying too hard to be mature like many will tell you - but because the characters and story were truly interesting. \r\nPart II: Art\r\nI really love the character designs in this show, they're unique and expressive. This is one of those rare occasions were I really feel like they nailed both the character designs and the overall art style. \r\nThe animation isn't perfect but I think itaged well, it won't make you feel like you're watching a low-budget or 30 year old show. \\n\\n\r\nPart III: Sound\\n\r\nAdmittedly the sound is probably the weakest part of Speed Grapher, it's not that it's glaringly bad and you most likely won't even form an opinion on it while watching because it's pretty mediocre. It could have been better, and I think having a really good OST would have pushed my overall score and nostalgia to the top. \\n\\n\r\nPart IV: Story\\n\r\nThe story is perfect for what the show is going for, it seemingly does everything it sets out to do. I don't want to give even a grain of detail about the actual subject of the story because I feel like even the synopsis gives too much away so I apologize for the vagueness but I promise the story is best enjoyed going in completely blind.",

I felt like the morbid aspects of the show could not be outweighed, and the anime failed in what it intended to do and instead comes off as a really bizarre, botched attempt to say something profound abt the sex industry. \r\nTHAT BEING SAID, it is a wonderful experience makingother people watch this show.

This anime provides a crazy situation about money hungry figures who use sex and currency to corrupt the minds of famous actors, doctors, and especially politicians, through the power of the supernatural.

            "content": "In theory, Speed Grapher is an adult anime with themes of greed and love, but in execution, is an anime that just kind of falls flat in its theming and characterization of villains in exchange for some really cool and innovative action scenes. Allow me to explain. (Theming and character issues in paragraphs 2,3&4, Music in 5, Positivity in 6)\r\n     The writers of Speed Grapher want the viewer to see a world where in a post-war environment the rich have gotten richer and the poor get poorer. The first mistake made is that one sees nopoor people in this show. The rich are set up to be extraordinarily wealthy. This is okay. The problem starts with how as far as the exposition says, the poor lead absolutely terrible lives, yet none of them are ever seen. We see some prostitutes and drag queens, but those are just generic things out of any poor environment. They aren't starving or anything either. Nobody in this show is doing all that bad for themselves overall. This means that there is no dichotomy shown between the rich and the poor, which was part of the original premise. Anyone who claims that the main character, Saiga, is poor is clearly wrong based on how he can constantly buy new cameras, outfits, medical treatment, get cars, and support another human being the whole time throughout the entire series. Seeing as how Saiga is supposed to be a mirror of Suitengu, the villain, who has more money than god, this is a bit of a major screw up. The lack of  juxtaposition between the rich and the poor leads to the viewer believing that there aren't actually any poor people and fails to get the point of the \"money is the root of all evil\" theme through. I guess a war between the wealthy and the slightly less wealthy will just have to do.\\n\\n\r\n     The second major problem with Speed Grapher is that despite trying to show that money corrupts people, none of the things that the various villains of the show do seem to be caused by being rich. One lady eats diamonds. That's not because she's rich, it's because she's a freak. She belongs on My Strange Addiction rather than be a henchman for the leader of a large underground organization. The show goes into a backstory bit about how her husband drove himself into debt getting diamonds for her, but she isn't ever shown to be sympathetic. Instead, the story leads the viewer to dislike her more, seeing as how it seems as though she liked the diamonds more than her husband. It isn't shown that money made any of the characters in the show crazy. In fact, it only shows that all of the people in the super special rich people club are just a bunch of sexual deviants and freaks because  that's just how they are. One guy is just obsessed with skin because that's his bit. It just seems like money isn't even the problem in this world as much as just weirdoes who also happen to have money.\\n\\n\r\n    This leads into the third major problem with this show, which is the gratuity with which we are exposed to degenerate sexual behaviors. The degeneracy isn't the problem. The sex isn't the problem. The problem is that the viewer is shown these things far too many times after they've already gotten the point. While at first it seems to be a display of maturity on the part of the series, being willing to show sex stuff openly and all, but as it goes on, it just demonstrates how little understanding it has for all things lewd. This comes from an overall lack of sexual tension between any characters in the show. Saiga and his lady Ginza have a sort of sexual relationship, but there isn't any tension. The same can at first be said of The villain Suitengu and his lady-friend Shinsen Tenozu. They just kind of have sex sometimes with no real build up or expectation. Characters never explore sex or sexuality in any way, and it's just there for no particular reason. It's dumb.\\n\\n\r\n   The last thing I have to complain about before explaining that I actually like this show is the music. The opening and the second ending theme of Speed Grapeher are pretty good. Everything else is trash that never sets the mood or accurately displays the tone of any given scene. The show has an odd amount of 80's synthesizers despite having a 2000's grunge vibe that would have felt more dirty if more grunge, punk, and progressive rock had been used in the soundtrack opposed to clean and controlled sounds they have. That's it for my complaints.\\n\\n\r\n    I liked this show. You as the reader of this review have no reason to believe that, but it's true. Despite its faults, Speed Grapher did one thing really well, and that one thing drives its score up to a seven. That thing of course is its action scenes. Every fight and encounter in Speed Grapher is outstanding. All of the characters have cool powers that work in interesting ways and are used with a great amount of creativity. Due to this, the show has an appeal closer to Jojo's Bizarre Adventure and Darker than Black. In fact, I'd say that it's a really good in-between of those two shows. In Darker than Black, the powers are only used in one way, but the fights are really dynamic because of it, and in Jojo, the powers are complex, and the fights have a lot of creativity behind them because of it. Speed Grapher gives our main character the ability to blow things up with his camera. This is used in interesting ways, such as when he photographs a reflective surface, the reflection blows up. If he shoots a transparent surface, whatever's behind it blows up. Where the characters fall short, their powers do the heavy lifting. Whether that happens to be a good or bad thing is really up to the viewer, but I was in the mood for some neat action scenes when I was watching it, and the show definitely delivers on that front.\\n\\n\r\n     Speed Grapher has a number of problems, but is worth a watch if you like Darker than Black (Dynamic fights), Jojo (But not as campy) , and Texhnolyze (With a lot less nihilism), but serves as a watered down, shallow combination of them. It's pretty neat. Try it out.",

Pretty boring tbh and I stopped watching it after about 3 episodes, then skimmed through it a little further.\r\nI think it's because the characters are just all so fucking retarded, I couldn't invest in the story one bit. Sure, there is a crazy rubber gimp flying around ripping people's heads off with his crotch,and the heroine's mother did just pay her (female) schoolteacher to have sex with her in front of her daughter, in order to teach her a lesson about \"money iz poweru\" or something, but beyond the initial \"shock\" value I find myself not really giving a fuck about any of it. The whole show seems to have been designed to be perfect for reviewers to come up with great summary sentences about all the crazy whacky things that happen in it, without any further thought going to its actual substance. Most of the episodes beyond the first one don't even have much action - just a long slow buildup full of boring conversations, and then a retarded animefight to finish it. \\n\\n\r\nAnd all this despite fairly decent art. It is not an ugly show by any means, but my brain still just forgot I was watching it before too long.",

The first hint that things are going wrong in SG is how the fights take on a suspiciously monster-of-the-week format where the photographer shoots a plutocrat or their agents to death, inside a boring 'flee with the girl from baddies'. This too-long plot finally breaks down into an even more bizarre plot involving the big bad, which I give props for at least not being nearly as boring and predictable as the chase arc (even if I kept wondering, \"wouldn't this all work much better if toned down, rewritten by someone reasonably intelligent, and set in the _GitS: Stand Alone Complex_ universe?\").\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, unsatisfactory.

            "content": "Speed Grapher, I think, may be the most underrated anime i've seen :) It seems that very few people watch it, and very few appreciate the(Though at times weird and creepy) beautiful aspect of the story.\r\nStory: 8- Speed Grapher has an extremely unique and well executed story, im not going to give away any spoilers, just know its amazingly original.\r\nArt: 9- The visuals of the anime aren't anything amazingly breathtaking, however the anime is almost 10 years old, so in my opinion the art was pretty great for the time it was made.\r\nSound: 8- The only reason this got knocked down 2 points is becauseof the dull opening of the show. The Ost doesn't stand out,but it fits the anime perfectly. Both of the ed's(The second being my favorite) are standout's as well.\\n\r\nCharacters: 10- All of the main cast in the anime are unique and stand out in a crowd. I also love the kind of Father/Daughter type of relationship between the two main characters Saiga and Kagyra.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10- Though this anime is extremely dark and not for everyone, i myself throughly enjoyed it, i also though that it had an absolutely perfect ending.\\n\r\nOverall: 9- Speed Grapher is an exceptional anime, with a unique plot,great animation, nice ed's, Terrific characters, and a satisfying ending, and i highly reccomend it those who are searching for an anime that is darker and rather twisted\\n\r\n:)\\n\\n",

            "content": "I found this anime, Speed Grapher, a fairly refreshing change of pace from a lot of the turds in the anime pool now a days. for the first half it was a thrilling and genuinely shocking if, like me, you didnt bother with the synopsis and checked it out on good faith that you'll find a diamond in this beach full of rhinestones. The plot has its holes, like why the hell the main guy was the only one who had a limit on his powers (you'll see what i mean) while the rest just went bitch crazy. character development is beautifully executed in myopinion, whether it be the story behind the main character and his camera, the main bad guy and his sister, or the parents of our main heroin, all nicely thought out i believe. its not perfection but better than just having some average looking ass unrealistically fucking and cheating on/with 7 different girls (*cough* school days) \\n\r\nthe sound track is also very fitting. It added what most scenes needed.\\n\r\nArt had its moments nothing really extraordinary.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment I give an 8 and in my opinion this is the important one, I watch anime to be entertained more than just watch pretty pictures. I enjoyed the legit suspense at times, it was fun observing the characters change, the story had its holes but nothing too outrageous taking away from it all. the story does slow after bout the half-way point but nothing so bad that you sit there wishing the writers's crabs get herpes like in some other animes.\\n\\n\r\nIt was  enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nif you have the time, i think this is worth a peek. I recommend it.\\n",

            "content": "I find when I see this anime on forums alike It usually has a Hate or Love sorta aspect to it. Personally, I absolutely loved this anime, though it is definitely not for the faint of heart.\r\nThis story revolves around a war photographer, who gets caught up in a mystery revolving around a young girl. I don't usually like to give synopsis's within my reviews, so if you want the nitty gritty details you can go find those yourselves. Personally, I enjoy watching older characters more than younger ones, but that definitely depends on the anime. Saiga, the protagonist is a vetran war photographer whoinherits the ability to... explode anything he takes a picture of. When I explain this to people most just stop listening when I mention that bit. But the anime still maintains its serious edge with absolutely stellar fight scenes and very serious adult undertones.  The story overall was nice and unique, not over top and even, just maybe, realistic. Maybe the peep show bit with the harem or nudity was pushing it a little, but if you get past all the echi, and heavy severe sexual themes, you get an amazing mix of action and plot that will most likely satisfy your urge of badass anime.\\n\\n\r\nFor characters, I didn't have a problem with any particular one. Maybe slight things pissed me off here and there, but overall no one went onto my bad side. The protagonist, Saiga, and Kagura, the two main characters had nice character development throughout the story. Each one had unique views and pasts. One thing I noticed though, having watched this anime multiple times is that almost every character presented here had a terrible past - I can name at least 3 characters that had a form of human trafficking or violent assault in their past. It wasn't bad though, since the story was pretty much chalk full of that sort of topic and It just added to the dark undertone of each character. Each one had a reason for they're actions, and the antagonist especially. It was a constant struggle from dislike to sympathy with the main antagonist. I found it visually and mentally interesting trying to piece together each and every story.\\n\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed the music. I personally love when Anime decide to go out of they're comfort zone with something different. Whether it works or not I always seem to have a sort of respect for those kinds of productions. In the case for Speed Grapher, they used an American song, Girls on Film by Duran Duran. It fit it quite nicely, with a retro theme but still giving it nice dark undertones.\\n\\n\r\nArt wise I was impressed. It wasn't one of those stellar animations, but it never seemed to bug me. I tend to be hyper sensitive with art and animation - but this anime never seemed to let me down in that department.\\n\\n\r\nAfter hearing all the good things I have to say about this anime, there is just one tiny little thing that gets me every time I re watch this anime. For how ever many people I speak to, I like to associate Siaga and Kagura as a sort of fatherly love/desire relationship. Yet at the very end of the series, it contradicted they're relationship and hints in the 2-3 last episodes of something more than protector or friend. I really REALLY do not see those two as any more than that. It's up to your discretion but I personally don't like to entertain the thought of a 40 year old man with a 16-18 year old high school student.\\n\\n\r\nOther than that I absolutely loved this anime and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good story, but can handle the gore, violence, dark undertones and sexual themes.",

Sound is ok, voices are generic, music sounds 80's. Character is ok, nothing great about them, interesting but just didn't grab me. \r\nI think they should have focused on saiga's war stories. If they did I didn't get far enough to see it. \r\nA better yet similar anime would definitely be Darker than Black.",
