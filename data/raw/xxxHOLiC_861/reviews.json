            "content": "On the technical side of things, I have many bones to pick with the art and animation here. Actually there are too many bones to pick out on these spaghetti people, who I feel like I could easily snap across my thumb if I ever pat them on the back, even the supernaturally voluptuous Yuuko. Seriously, that woman should have SPINAL PROBLEMS with a rack of that magnitude on that beanpole, and throughout the entire series\u2019 run, I never got used to the tiny-headed, long-bodied creatures they call people in this show, or the way they move either. Really fluid animation could have compensated forthis bizarre art style, maybe even made it really cool, but the animation here is middling at best, and oftentimes slips into shaky and poor. It\u2019s just unsettling. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is wickedly haunting and appropriate, and compensates for the limited animation well in some episodes where it\u2019s dearly needed. Actually, the music is pretty top-tier, especially when the mood calls for SCARY! \\n\\n\r\nThe dub is actually easier on the ears than the original Japanese and this is mostly due to the soothing liquidity in Yuuko and Doumeki\u2019s voicework. It was wise of them to play their characters so rich and low, because Watanuki is the most incredibly annoying little goober I\u2019ve ever heard. I\u2019m not saying the acting is bad, because Watanuki\u2019s clearly supposed to reach that ungodly level of spastic that he does and sometimes it\u2019s really funny, but MORE often, oh gosh, I just want to send him to that little internment camp in Japan where they keep all the School Rumble characters so they can whip him into shape. Still, there\u2019s no big difference between the language tracks, so preferences will just split where they always do. Oh, one of these days I\u2019ll get to slam some bad voice acting\u2026but not yet.\\n\\n\r\nThis series really isn\u2019t bad for wasting time on, but the fact that I have to use the word \u201cwasting\u201d probably indicates how original or striking it is. Most of the adventures of Yuuko and company are underwhelming and talky enough to turn a two minute neat idea into a twenty minute \u201cwhat the heck was that?\u201d Let\u2019s just say that Yuuko has a very particular way of looking at the world, and her routine cautionary speeches can become grating at best, and childishly elementary or just plain stupid in a pretty package at worst. Occasionally, Yuuko would state some grand moral that REALLY rubbed me the wrong way, and given how much she has to say, I imagine that this will be the case for most viewers at one point or another. \\n\\n\r\nMixed in with all these middling ideas, there are a few glowing gems, though, I can\u2019t deny that. Episodes involving a snowball fight where the snowmen do the battling, and a shoutout episode to the famous short story, \u201cThe Monkey\u2019s Paw,\u201d are a few among them. Still, I\u2019m talking roughly an eighth of the episodes are really memorable. xxxHolic relies far too much on these tired platitudes and more tired running gags like Yuuko always being drunk and/or hung over and Watanuki going off on Doumeki like a pasty-white cherry bomb. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a shame because we really want to know more about Watanuki\u2019s gift and what it has to do with the death of his parents, his friendship with Doumeki, and most importantly, his \u201cdestined\u201d servitude to Yuuko. It\u2019s something that is constantly foreshadowed but never revealed to even the smallest extent, in favor of more Hogwarts-esque hijinks. Sometimes all an episode will have going for it is a fun little reference to one of CLAMP\u2019s many other series, and if that\u2019s a draw, you know you\u2019re in trouble story-wise.\\n\\n\r\nSo, while there\u2019s fun to be had, the basic fact is that everything xxxHolic attempts, the style and the spirit, or spirits, if you wanna get all punny, has been done much better in different shows with higher budgets. (Kino\u2019s Journey, Mushi-Shi, Galaxy Express 999) As such, while not at all bad, this is the first show I\u2019ve reviewed that I can\u2019t honestly recommend. It\u2019s tearfully AVERAGE in every way possible. A ghost, if you will, of what it seems to promise.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, xxxHolic leaps out as visually strange and narratively exciting, but it\u2019s a hollow fa\u00e7ade hiding a frequently boring show.\\n\\n\r\n*THIS IS A PARTIAL TRANSCRIPT OF MY VIDEO REVIEW WHICH CAN BE FOUND HERE: \\n\\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJMlYfyErY\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!",

            "content": "Funny, creepy, dark, interesting and clever. Those would be the words that could describe this anime.\r\nIt&rsquo;s funny &ndash; thanks to Watanuki&rsquo;s wild antics as well as Mokona&rsquo;s drunkenness. Creepy &ndash; mostly because it scared the heck out of me sometimes (especially episode 10, 12 and 24). Dark, because it presents the world in a way that people rarely see. It&rsquo;s interesting &ndash; you get hooked into it and you actually become an xxxHOLIC-holic. Finally, it&rsquo;s clever because it doesn&rsquo;t take the viewers for fools.\r\nThe characters are just great. Doumeki and Watanuki are yin and yang. They always seem to have this love-hate comedy routine whereinDoumeki says one thing then it annoys Watanuki right off the bat, then Himawari comments on how close they are. I also like Yuuko. I am always amazed by her wisdom and how she takes on her job. I think the concept of just compensation in something other than money is very clever. I like her here more, instead of the Yuuko from TRC. The black Mokona cracks me up as well even though I&rsquo;m a tad bothered that he&rsquo;s not as well mannered as the white Mokona.\\n\\n\r\nProduction IG&rsquo;s work was a bit interesting. The visuals seemed off to me sometimes, but there&rsquo;s something about it that keeps me watching. I didn&rsquo;t like the colors though, since most of it was concentrated on the main characters/elements. The background elements seemed a bit dull sometimes. I did like the demon parade episode, because the scenes were more vivid than usual. As expected of CLAMP, the characters have slightly deformed body types and tall and stringy characters. I guess it&rsquo;s what separates them from others.\\n\\n\r\nI&rsquo;m not familiar too with the three main seiyuu, but I think they did a splendid job. Jun Fukuyama was very entertaining as Watanuki. Sayaka Ohara&rsquo;s mature, sultry and womanly voice fit Yuuko&rsquo;s personality really well and Kazuya Nakai&rsquo;s voice was also well suited to Doumeki&rsquo;s character. Of course, Mika Kikuchi was very entertaining as Mokona as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe music was very much like the plot &ndash; a bit dark, but contemporary. I like the catchy opening theme (19sai), the cutesy first ending theme (Reason), and the j-rock second ending theme (Kagerou). The BGM really helped in making things a lot more creepier too.\\n\\n\r\nI&rsquo;m really glad that I found the time to watch the series. I have to say that this is my favorite CLAMP series by far &ndash; mostly because the CLAMP series I&rsquo;ve seen haven&rsquo;t impressed me as much as xxxHOLIC. I&rsquo;ll end this review with Yuuko&rsquo;s words that resonated throughout the series &ndash; There is no such thing as coincidence in this world. There is only the inevitable.",

            "content": "Prepare to be taken on a tour de force through the world of the supernatural. Or maybe just a regular tour. I wouldn't know. Having only recently experienced the genre of \"supernatural\" anime, xxxHOLiC (hereby referred to as simply \"Holic\") was a breath of fresh air from my usual action/fantasy fare.\r\nThe story behind Holic is intriguing and interesting, revolving around spirits, ghosts, and the very strange. Geared towards an older and more sophisticated audience, there's little action, but loads of thought-provoking and amazingly insightful dialogue. Holic is the kind of anime that gets your mind pumping about topics such as fate, destiny, and one's purposein life. Plus, there's a side to it that makes statements about how people live and society in general. Not to mention that it's educational as well. Holic offers an insight into a part of Japanese culture that most people rarely see. \\n\\n\r\nConcerning the plot, however, Holic is another anime that is driven by episodic events. There seems to be no real overall direction for the story. Normally, this would leave me feeling slightly cheated and unsatisfied, but after surviving through the likes of Ouran and the Wallflower, I've come to accept that the episodic plot system is a genre on its own and it's here to stay.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, a plot that doesn't know where it's going hurts any character development. The characters are well made, with their own distinct personalities, but stay relatively the same throughout the course of the plot.  No one shows very much significant growth. Granted, everyone is wiser and better, having learned the lessons distributed throughout 24 episodes of madness. Perhaps that's the elusive character growth that I've been looking for?\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of artwork, the artistic foundations were laid down in the manga by the increasingly popular mangaka group CLAMP. And they've done a very good job. Yuuko's wardrobe is definitely something to pay attention to (ahem), and though everyone has ridiculously long arms, legs, and necks, it actually provides a sense of levity in a serious setting (that, and the alcoholism). Alas, there's a slight issue with the fact that only the characters important to the plot are actually drawn in. Any bodies that are only required to be &quot;fillers&quot; (like a bunch of random people at a supermarket) are not colored and lack faces. In my opinion, it has symbolic meaning, but it could also be attributed to pure laziness. Dunno which to choose.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and speaking of laziness, the sound was great. Loved the opening theme, but didn't really pay attention to the background music. Voice-acting was top notch, especially with all the high pitched and slightly unique voices coming from characters like Mokona, Maru, and Moro. That is all.\\n\\n\r\nIn the enjoyment section: I finished Holic in the space of a week, and indeed, I was completely hooked. I savored every bit of supernatural strangeness, and I'll be looking for more with the second season.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, Holic certainly isn't unique, for there seems to be an ever-growing list of anime that deal with the supernatural, the occult, and just really weird stuff in general. But as a starter series for the newly-converted, it's definitely worth watching.",

            "content": "Surprisingly enough, xxxHolic is the first request I've had for a Clamp review. For those of you who aren't familiar with the group, they're an all female group who started out writing doujinshi before moving on to professional work in 1987. They've been fairly prolific, but their end products tend to range considerably in quality. Some being spectacular, others being terrible. xxxHolic leans toward the latter.\r\nxxxHolic is an anime that doesn't have an underlying plot so much as a series of loosely connected episodes that are all based off of Japanese folk lore. A young man named Watanuki can see spirits. He finds a shopthat grants wishes and ends up working there part time. Shenanigans ensue. Most of the episodes have only very loose connections to each other. An anime can be setup like this and still be well done, but xxxholic isn't. One major issue that pops up multiple times is that serious moments, which should have some impact on the characters or the plots to come, are dropped and never mentioned again instead. Another issue is that the episodes don't really do anything interesting with the folklore. Instead it just throws the reference at you, follows up with some faux intellectual statement to wrap things up and moves on to the next thing. The comedic aspect is another area where it fails since there are very few moments that are actually funny. Most of the humour is based on Watanuki having really over the top reactions to what's going on and it's not particularly funny when they do it the first time. So doing it multiple times every bloody episode just gets repetitive and really boring. The semi-serious moments they try to have are also ruined by them always reverting to \"comedy\" quickly after those moments end. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters certainly don't make up for the largely absent plot. Each one has one or two exaggerated personality traits that define them. Watanuki over-reacts to things and is a tool. Doumeki helps Watanuki and has no visible reaction to anything. Himawari either doesn't understand the obvious or toys with Watanuki for fun. Yuuko always knows what's happening but only deals with issues personally when she has too. She also drinks a lot. And I just described the four major characters completely with a few adjectives. I could do the same for the secondary characters, but that would take a while. One other issue with the characters is that there are several plot lines involving individual characters that seem like they could potentially lead to development, but they either get dropped or go unresolved in favour of keeping the status quo.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is terrible. I'm used to borked proportions in anime, but xxxHolic just takes it too far. The characters have ludicrously long and slim limbs and bodies with tiny little heads. This makes them look more like models made out of string cheese than actual people. The backgrounds are generally sparse and the supernatural beings don't have much impact. They just look bland most of the time. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice work is difficult to judge. There are a lot of really talented voice actors working on this such as Nakai Kazuya, Ohara Sayaka, Itou Shizuka and Fukuyama Jun but they all adopt these really exaggerated voices which add to the lack of depth for their characters. I blame the direction since I know that all of them can do roles with depth. The music ranges from bad to generic. \\n\\n\r\nThe yuri factor is a 2.4/10. Simply because Yuuko gets really touchy with some of the other female characters and it comes off as a bit homoerotic. \\n\\n\r\nMy final rating for xxxHolic is a 3/10. The art is bad. The characters have no depth. It's not funny and what little story there is lacks interesting content. If you want a good anime grounded in Japanese myths there are far better options like Mushishi or Kino's Journey. If you want something by Clamp specifically there are still better anime, like Magic Knight Rayearth or Cardcaptor Sakura. As for xxxHolic, you can skip it.",

            "content": "\u201cMokona is a Mokona.\u201d - Mokona\r\nThere are many things we don\u2019t understand about the world. But as much as we are stupefied by the unknown, we often take everyday human behavior for granted. And with a show centered on the supernatural, we\u2019d think that the supernatural are the enigma, when in reality, humanity and society are the real mystery.\r\nEnter xxxHOLiC, a show that explores the irrationality of human behavior in a supernatural context. I admit, this show wasn\u2019t too high on my priority list. Though after my cousin watched and expressed his love for it, I decided to give it a shot and boy, wasI in for an unexpected treat; a treat that spawned a second season, four OVAs, and a movie. Note that this review will only be about the first season, but rest assured that I will get to the other installments. \\n\\n\r\nSTORY - 7\\n\\n\r\nxxxHOLiC is the story of a high school boy\u2019s encounters with the supernatural after being taken in as an apprentice by a rather odd employer who claims to grant wishes. That pretty much sums it up. Nothing more, nothing less.\\n\\n\r\nPacing-wise, this is where xxxHOLiC shines.\\n\\n\r\nEpisodic shows are a double-edged blade. On one hand, they excel stylistically by putting the characters in various scenarios of differing themes, thus granting an expansion of premise and necessary character development. On the other, each episode has an individual story which allows little room to move the overarching plot along. It isn\u2019t one unified narrative, but a collection of short stories; each with their own style, conflict, and lesson. For the first season at least, xxxHOLiC may not have a sense of plot direction yet but it takes full advantage of its pacing in displaying its brand of weird charm, unsettling atmosphere, and surprising insight. You get goosebumps on one episode, ponder on another, and smile after the next. The episodic pacing in this show makes it seem like a slice-of-life show more than anything, incorporating elements of supernatural, horror, suspense, comedy, and romance along the way. \\n\\n\r\nART - 8\\n\\n\r\nTwo words: Character design.\\n\\n\r\nWhen you have characters that have the average height of a professional basketball player, hands as big as their head, arms as long as their legs, and virtually no muscle, you know people will love it or hate it. Fortunately, I belong to the former.\\n\\n\r\nI commend Clamp for a job well done on the zany, slenderman-like character designs. Though anatomically incorrect and disproportionate, it intensifies both wacky and tense scenes by emphasizing body movement, and exudes an exotic vibe that complements the show\u2019s eerie and mystical setting. Seeing the fleshed-out stick figure look is also reminiscent to the flat, gritty, and edgy cartoon style of the 90\u2019s which are a refreshing departure from today\u2019s smooth, vibrant, and meaty designs.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation, provided by Production I.G., is standard for a show aired on 2006. Colors are dull and faded, supernatural set pieces are smoky and oriental, lighting is dim and claustrophobic, and cinematography is still and calm. In general, the animation is\u2026 subtly off, and it works in the show\u2019s favor surprisingly well.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND - 9\\n\\n\r\nFor xxxHOLiC\u2019s sound, I\u2019ve taken into account the OP/EDs, BGM, ambient sounds, and voice acting, because all of these are worth the mention.\\n\\n\r\nFor your information, I have never skipped this show\u2019s openings and two ending songs. Not even once. I might even go as far as to say that this show\u2019s OP and first ED are one of the best I\u2019ve heard in a while. Each episode starts with an infectious funk song of quirky synthesizers, hypnotic guitars, and groovy basslines riddled with dissonant angst and regret. \u201c19sai\u201d (19 Years Old) by Shikao Suga perfectly encapsulates what xxxHOLiC is all about: an otherworldly coming-of-age story in a strange and wonderful world full of temptation and misunderstanding where everyone just wants to break free and find peace of mind. All of that is neatly wrapped in a nice little bow by the end of each episode with Fonogenico\u2019s \u201cReason,\u201d a cute and light piece of keyboard and guitar pop which resonates with the show\u2019s motif of inevitabilities; in that everything happens for a reason and embracing what has happened and what will happen is the only way to go. By the second half of the show, the show ends with Buck-Tick\u2019s \u201cKagerou\u201d (Shimmering Air), a straightforward rock song of wailing guitars and yearning vocals dominated with themes of dire escapism and obsessive attachment which fits the more serious tone of the latter half of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe BGM did an exemplary job in covering a wide array of moods while being consistent with the show\u2019s supernatural backdrop due to the songs\u2019 dreamlike quality. The instrumentation ranged from hair-raising ambient scores of distant howls, sinister chords, and violent percussions to playfully halloweenish or heartfelt synthesizer, string, and piano pieces. It became integral in defining xxxHOLiC\u2019s hauntingly eccentric yet down-to-earth nature.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s common sense that ambient sounds are supposed to match a given atmosphere. So in this case, there will be two instances when I mention ambient sound engineering; either when it stands out in a bad or good way. In xxxHOLiC, ambient sounds surprisingly affect a scene\u2019s inflection in such a way that it disconcerts the viewer even in the most mundane of scenes. The ambience rides along with the show\u2019s animation by exhibiting a nuance that there\u2019s always something wrong, despite a given context being normal and safe. xxxHOLiC gains this added horror/suspense edge even if that isn\u2019t necessarily what the show is all about. But like the BGM, it immensely aids in immersion and made the setting darker without feeling unnatural to the show\u2019s premise. Because let\u2019s face it, what you don\u2019t understand scares you. And the sound department did a great job of capturing the fear and awe of the supernatural experience. xxxHOLiC knows when to use silence, cut off sound, modulate voices, and mix in subtle noises, whispers, and sounds to enhance the profound yet dubious undertone lying beneath the show\u2019s innocent exterior. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting expressed each character\u2019s key trait very well. The lovably annoying Watanuki gets an incessant high-pitched voice that hushes down on the show\u2019s more solemn moments. Deadpan Doumeki remains a deep and monotone pitch all throughout but can give off a softer vibe while still keeping his cool. Yuuko\u2019s voice completely captivates the ears; shifting from immature exuberance to alluring sultriness while maintaining a neutral and elusive stance. Maru, Moro, and Mokona keep up with the playful high-pitched voice to even out the show\u2019s somber tendencies. Himawari\u2019s typical schoolgirl voice is cute and unassuming. Let\u2019s just leave it at that.  The characters often change in every episode with these being the main recurring characters with ample screen time.\\n\\n\r\nP.S. The dub wasn\u2019t really my cup of tea. Todd Haberkorn\u2019s Watanuki turned the lovably annoying character into a whining wuss.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS - 7\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in xxxHOLiC are similar to that of a fairy tale. They are very distinct from one another and portray a striking personality all throughout the series to fulfill each of their respective roles. \\n\\n\r\nWatanuki is the ceaselessly complaining and hardworking nice guy we all know and love. Doumeki is the dull and straightforward jock as well as Watanuki\u2019s polar opposite and comic foil. Together, they banter their way into their own supernatural misadventures under the watchful eye of Yuuko. Occasionally joining them in their struggle to address Yuuko\u2019s customers (if they aren\u2019t doing various odd jobs), we have:\\n\\n\r\nMaru and Moro, a jolly pair of kids serving Yuuko. Mokona, Clamp\u2019s bunny-like mascot that serves as Yuuko\u2019s mischievous friend and drinking buddy. And Himawari, Watanuki\u2019s ditzy and innocent love interest. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest are either the shop\u2019s customers or supernatural entities involved.\\n\\n\r\nInteractions between the main cast can get formulaic and most of the character development can only be credited to Watanuki. His character development was more personal than substantial. It wasn\u2019t a noticeable growth spurt nor a radical shift in ideals. It was more of a hushed voice within the character telling him that he learned something that he still can\u2019t fully comprehend. Though lacking well-roundedness and middle ground, the characters were all lovable and relatable, with both the humans and the supernatural having independent and realistic ideals. The huge cast of episode-specific characters also left a memorable impact which made up for their static personality.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT - 9\\n\\n\r\nAs you can already tell, I love this show. It was like watching a more light-hearted yet more sinister version of The Addams Family with all the grim and whimsical energy evident in the show\u2019s production. With constant references to superstition and common social stigma, it provided enough realism to make it accessible and understandable compared to most supernatural lore. What it lacked in plot direction, it made up for in style, immersion, and groundedness. But what really left a lasting impression on me was the insight.\\n\\n\r\nxxxHOLiC tells us how little we understand life, society, and ourselves. How learning, growing and transforming into something better means going outside our comfort zone and exploring the world. How meeting different people with various problems helps us understand that there is nothing good or evil. How inherently selfish and fickle we are. \\n\\n\r\nUltimately, how strange it is to be human. \\n\\n\r\nWe are riddled with inconsistencies and flaws which drive us to suffering and bitter realization. And in those moments when we are most vulnerable, we understand how beautiful it is to feel pain and embrace reality. We bask in our imperfection and eccentricity because it is what defines us.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - 8\\n\\n\r\nxxxHOLiC is a wondrous, uncanny, frisky, and sentimental ride through the life and times of Watanuki, a highschool boy blessed and cursed with the blood that attracts spirits. It deserves praise, not for overwhelming the viewer with something revolutionary, but for telling a story that says something about ourselves. Maybe I\u2019m just putting too much thought into this. Overall, the show was simple, yet clever in its execution to deliver the full force of its content. As for where that content is going, I\u2019m eager to find out in the next season.",

The characters are so annoying and they say the same thing over and over, so many times in each episode that it will start to bother you. In my opinion the art design is lacking.

Two characters whos fate has intertwined. xxxHOLiC is a collection of different strange yet interesting stories which happens to produce a happy ending on every episode. One particular viewer would learn something from the episodes of xxxHOLiC. It's about the mistake of humans and the solution to them were given by the main character \"Yuuko\". I'd say that some episodes were mediocre but interesting enough. \r\nArt\r\n- Production IG was involved, judging the fact that this anime were made in theyear 2006, I'd say that the animation is somewhat outdated. I'm not saying that it is that bad, it's just that there's nothing special about the animation. The characters stays on their intentionally deformed shape. It's not that bad really.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\n- I like the BGM used in this anime. It is ingeniously used in every episode and fits the whole episode inside out. The group behind the BGM is SENS project and they're really good. They really did portray the word &quot;Mysterious&quot; in their works and it is really notable. Some scores were relaxing, one track I liked is shizuka na hibi. The OP is good and the ED &quot;Reason&quot; is love XDD. Everyone would enjoy listening to the music used in xxxHOLiC.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\n-There are different characters with different situations. Most of the characters bears different sins and after they consult Yuuko, they seem to vanish for Yuuko grants their wish to cleanse their sins and live normally. One would relate to one or two characters or even more in xxxHOLiC. In short, xxxHOLiC portrays the problems of today and how to solve them, this is one factor that I've noticed and cherished most. That's why I gave it this score.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\n-It's enjoyable and relaxing. Although there are some scary episodes, it's not like you'll brood and will never sleep about it, the scare factor here is mild don't worry. This anime will relax you and you'll learn different lessons about life, sins and the pain they bring.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\n-The second season is coming out, what are you waiting for? grab xxxHOLiC. It's worth your time and I hope you will enjoy this anime just like I did.",

            "content": "Oh CLAMP! I&rsquo;ve always loved their works; there is (albeit, sometimes misguided) sincerity in their stories that many other anime/manga can&rsquo;t quite manage. An example of this is in the second episode that revolved around a girl with a pinky problem. It is revealed that it&rsquo;s not mere limb stiffness, because to Yuuko and Watanuki, they see that she has a trail of black smoke coming out from her finger. The episode goes to reveal what the black smoke is about and the type of life this girl leads. There is obvious social commentary going on, and in a very CLAMP-esque way, rather than anyform of judgement, it is simply an observation into human behaviour and how people cope with living.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style was something I had to get used to. Everyone in xxxHOLiC has tremendously long limbs, which makes them really tall. I guess it makes it stand out compared to other more glossy, better-proportioned anime series out there. It&rsquo;s pretty amusing how bosomy Yuuko is and how some of her many costumes shows it off off quite unabashedly. :P\\n\\n\r\nAs for characters, I really don&rsquo;t care for Watanuki too much. He&rsquo;s always so neurotic and prone to making a ruckus over the smallest things. However, as the main character, he gets the most character development, so that does make him difficult to hate. The other characters are prone to be kind of one-dimensional and can be summed up with a sentence. Watanuki&rsquo;s love interest is cute, pretty and sweet and his rival/friend is stoic, dependable and more silent than not. I guess my favourite character is definitely Yuuko. While she doesn&rsquo;t vary much from polarising from being mysterious and thoughtful, to being a spontaneous drunk, the former quality makes her very interesting. Character exploration is not too big in xxxHOLiC, but if you don&rsquo;t mind the existing, albeit archetypal, character types, then it shouldn&rsquo;t be a problem.\\n\\n\r\nCLAMP&rsquo;s attempt at humour works at times but it&rsquo;s not a consistent thing. I personally don&rsquo;t find it very funny whenever Watanuki gets all slapstickishly angry about something, but at times it does surprise me with how funny and adorable some of the characters are at times. But if you&rsquo;re looking for consistent humour, this anime probably would not fit the bill.\\n\\n\r\nxxxHOLiC is great if you want a well-paced, episodic anime that has somewhat of a focus on exploring social phenomena and human behaviour through a fate/destiny, supernatural light. Sometimes touching, often spooky, kooky and clever. Each episode, while it may not be gripping plot-wise, is one that leaves you wondering what the next episode would be about.",

            "content": "There are no coincidences in this world. There is only inevitability. If you find Yuko's shop, then that too was fate. It means you have a wish that can be granted. For a price of course. This is the simple premise for xxxHolic, a stylish and magical anime and manga series by CLAMP.\r\nxxxHolic is a show that tries to stimulate the viewer in many different ways. There's adventure, philosophy, plenty of comedy, and sometimes action, all with a distinctly CLAMPy flair. The routine nature of Watanuki's life between school and the shop allows for episodes to be largely interchangeable with no heavy storyline that coversall or even most of the season. Truth be told, Watanuki's wish to stop seeing spirits is rarely mentioned after the first episode, and it's basically just an excuse to have him start working at the shop. That's not necessarily a complaint though, because the individual stories or mini-arcs that make up the show are wholly fulfilling on their own.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough Watanuki is the protagonist, Yuko is the real star of the series and undeniably magnetic. Although her origins remain a mystery, she has enough charm and personality to keep one watching in any situation. On the surface, she playfully teases and bosses Watanuki around but seems to genuinely care about him even though she never explicitly states her feelings about... well, anything. Because Yuko is so attuned to the absolution of fate, she never gets emotional. Because Yuko is a wish granter, she doesn't help other people until they ask for and purchase her help. Even if she wanted to do otherwise, it would create an imbalance. Yet she never comes across as cold. She can be playful, aloof, serious, motherly, childish, sexy, and spontaneous.\\n\\n\r\nThe strength of xxxHolic is the way it uses colorful and whimsical events to illustrate the hidden side of human nature. Everyone who comes into the shop has a wish. It's never a shallow wish, and it's often something that is unusual or shameful. Watanuki is often confused by the problem or the solution, but Yuko explains to him many truths to life. The unspoken plot of xxxHolic is Yuko's role as a teacher to Watanuki, in result making him more of an adult. Aside from the philosophy, just being able to witness the wonderful mystical scenes of the spirit world for the first time with Watanuki is a treat.\\n\\n\r\nIf there's a downside to xxxHolic, it is probably the comedy, which comes across as cliched. Plus, they run the same gags into the ground again and again. One can't help but notice how Watanuki happily spazzes out every time the girl he has a crush on, Himawari, smiles at him. Then, his rival/friend Doumeki shows up, says one or two words, and Watanuki spazzes angrily with cartoonish exuberance. This is a scene you'll find in almost every episode of xxxHolic through both seasons. It's unfortunate that such a large amount of the show is comedy, because those parts are very run-of-the-mill.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is largely what you might expect from CLAMP, which is good to me, but everyone has REALLY long and skinny arms, legs, and torsos, to the point where Watanuki looks like a spider when he bends his legs. So while I wouldn't call most of the characters attractive, the style fits the show. The animation is minimized in a lot of scenes and episodes, and it's easy to see that when you contrast the first season to the second season which has improved production values. But it absolutely doesn't hurt the show very much.\\n\\n\r\nFor me, the complete attraction to xxxHolic is hard to summarize. It's a stylish feel, a mood, a charisma that the entire show gives off that kept me watching from beginning to end. It's the tension when Yuko shares a cup of tea with her new client. It's the relaxed feeling when Doumeki and Watanuki participate in the annual monster procession. It's the creeping madness of the owner of a monkey's paw. While not a perfect show by any means, it's a worthy addition to any library.",

            "content": "(Spoiler Free)\r\nA misleading title is one of my only qualms with this series. Far from being some sort of ecchi comedy, xxxHolic was one of the most thought provoking, moving, and beautiful animes I've had the pleasure of viewing.\r\nThe roots of the show are set deep in the grounds of Japanese folklore. Fans of the animated movie Spirited Away or of animes like Natsume Yuujinchou are sure to love the world of spirits and mysteries crafted in xxxHolic. \r\nThe story is mostly episodic with numerous different stories taking palce over 1 or 2 episodes each. While I usually prefer serial animes with longer arcs, xxxHolicsucceeds in connecting many of its episodes together. Instead of 20+ independant, stand-alone stories, we instead get what are more like snapshots of the characters life. Each 'picture' is different, yet all are connected and make up a larger story. Not only is this an excellent way to present a series, but each of the 20+ stories are masterpieces in and of themselves. Story earns a 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art in xxxHolic is, in my experience, unique. I personally found the original style to be completely beautiful, but not all will agree. Many find the slightly off human proprtions to be odd, and some find fault with over the top character movements. However most can agree that many of the backrounds, stories, and characters in xxxHolic are simply breathtaking. Scenic landscapes, a lantern parade of 1000 spirits, and an ever mysterious fortune teller's shop are just a handful of the many original and gorgeous scenes crafted by the show's masterful artwork. A deserved 10/10 for art in my most humble opinion.\\n\\n\r\nSound was also impressive. I, like most, don't often notice a soundtrack unless I'm listening for it. Yet the oftentimes powerful, and beautiful music of xxxHolic perfectly meshed with the art and story to create some truely moving moments. Character voicing was superb, from the exasperated voice of the protagonist to the lofty, confident tone of a fortune teller, the actors of the show did a fabulous job bringing the characters to life. And lastly, a catchy opener, and two decent endings left me smiling. Sound earns a 9/10\\n\\n\r\nMany characters in xxxHolic are familiar arcetypes. Yet even though I'd seen every character's personality and mannerisms before, I hadn't always seen depth in those characters. Specifically the protagonist who, albeit slowly and more towards the end of the series, reveals himself as a person. Meanwhile a relationship forms seamlessly with his mysterious employer, a relationship that by the end of the series becomes a real, and believable bond between the two. Characters are by no means perfect however. A few cross the line from being 'familiar' to full blown cliche, and at times, the main character can be somewhat of a brat. Overall however the cast in xxxHolic carry the story well. An 8/10 for character.\\n\\n\r\nI loved the series from start to finish. The beautiful stories, the sporadic, but no less enjoyable humor, and the overall depth of the show were simply incredible, and a joy to watch. Enjoyment earns a solid 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall xxxHolic earns a 9/10 and my eager reccomendation. Beautiful art and stories that range from scary, to hilarious, to proverbial combined with solid characters and sound make this an anime well worth looking into.",

            "content": "Where do I begin with this amazing anime? I suppose I'll start with the lowest rated category: Story. The reason this is so low, is well, bluntly, there isn't much of a story. The first episode segways into the rest of the show, and is more of an excuse than anything to at least make sense of the series. There's very little persistence throughout the story, other than tiny character progression. Each episode is typically unrelated to the previous one. Now, although there isn't plot, that's not necessarily a bad thing. Each episode is unique from one another, aside from the typical antics of Watanukiand Domoki. Seemingly, in every episode, there's a philosophical idea behind it. I feel like, with each episode, a life lesson is taught. The dialogue is superb, and it feels like each word spoken actually means something. Many of Yuukos teachings to Watanuki are applicable to real life, and if you truly think about them, can change your life. The final episode might leave you wanting more, but you have to realize what this anime is. It's not about the destination, it's about the journey, and what you've taken away from it. Sure, you could watch this anime for pure entertainment purposes, Watanuki, Mocona, Domoki, all the characters are hilarious! But, the mature themes this anime addresses in such a light hearted tone is truly a work of art.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of art, there's not much to talk about. The character's extremities are blown way out of proportion. It is what it is, I suppose it adds a unique spin on the quite regular locations where the anime takes place. The one really interesting thing about the artwork though, is that any non-essential character to the episode isn't colored, and isn't detailed. They  have no face, no distinguishable clothes from each other(as in variety) ,  or any vibrance to them whatsoever. Now, this may be seen from a lack of funding/laziness perspective, but to me it really adds to the whole feel of the philosophical side. They don't change the anime in any way, so it doesn't matter what they look like, or what they wear. Very much so like in real life. There is really only one complaint you can have about this series, and that would be the actual animation. It can be choppy at times, but truly doesn't count as a negative in my opinion. It's not a fast paced anime, there's practically never any action, so higher framerate animations wouldn't add much to the series. Just my 2 cents.\\n\\n\r\nOnto the sound, fantastic. Numerous times throughout the anime characters will be walking around in a crowded area, like a mall or courtyard. The ambient chatter and conversations are always present when you'd expect them. Footsteps aplenty, making the environment always feel real.  I guess voice acting would fall under this category, so I must say, it was superb. Honestly, top notch voice acting on Watanuki. The first episode had me crying from laughter at the sincerity with which the voice actor portrayed in his voice. You can tell the emotion is there, from Himawari's schoolgirl innocent-esque, to Yuuko's deep, sophisticated delivery. These voice actors absolutely nailed their parts, and made the characters extremely life like, and made the world  entirely believable.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves are well thought out, though interaction between them can be muddy at times (Watanuki's seemingly irrational hate for Domoki). This can easily be forgotten though, as it is hyperbole for the sake of comedy. Each individual character though, is different from the others, and contrast with the others very well. Each one of them  has a distinct characteristic that makes them unique, Domoki's indifference, Watanuki's passion,  Yuuko's intelligence, and Himowari's innocence.  I suppose each one represent's an element of human  behavior, and the relations between them show how we have conflicting emotions within us at all times. I'm no philosopher, so enough about that.\\n\\n\r\nMy overall enjoyment of xxxHOLiC was through the roof. I honestly was ecstatic when I found out xxxHOLic Kei was the sequel,  because I can't get enough of this series. From Watanuki's always present sarcastic remarks, to the intelligent philosophical intrigues from Yuuko, this whole series amazed me.  I honestly don't understand how you can pack so much into just one anime. It has the perfect blend of comedy, and brilliance, which don't typically go hand in hand, at least not very well. I felt like each episode taught me something new about myself, and left me pondering life with the questions Yuuko arose  many times throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you're looking for a clever plot with thought-out character progression, look elsewhere, because there's little to none in xxxHOLiC. But, if you are looking for a mature anime, that's extremely entertaining, look no further.",

The Credits song was okay, but the intro won out :)\r\nArt_ I loved the artwork, it could have been touched up or more vibrant, but for this anime it definitely suited the dark atmosphere. The detailed kimonas, the cat like eyes, everything was perfectly in place. The way they did Yuuko's hair so beautifully. \r\nThe Subject: Most then anything I enjoyed the offbeat plot. Most of the themes in this series revolved around bad vices and good vices and what control we really have over them. All in allit's the type of story that makes you think and has in impact whether you take it lightly or not. There can be a deeper meaning. For those who like to delve into the darker side of the human psyche this would be a perfect anime for you watch. Wise tales can be told in fiction..\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nWatanuki Kimihiro:   is a typical high-school student living on his own because his parents were lost at a young age. He is down-to-earth and selfless, however some what of a loner. Also since he was a small he has has the ability to see and hear spirits.\\n\\n\r\nThe story seems to jump write into the plot line within the first few minutes. At once it is a typical scholastic student heading home from school when suddenly he is surrounded by demons, unknown to the casual observer; he becomes weighed down in all this supernatural power. Some how he manages to find refuge in a strange shop he hadn't noticed before. Inside the shop is a beautiful but almost devilish woman who tell that she can grant his with to make the spirits disappear. \\n\r\nOf course with some compensation.\\n\\n\r\nYuuko Ichiharais:   a very powerful witch, mostly known for her ability to send people to other dimensions and times (sometimes called \"The Dimensional Witch\" reference from Card Captor and Tsubasa Chronicles), and for her ability to grant any wish in exchange for an equal cost. Despite her seemingly immature and free-spirited attitude, Yuuko is also sage-like and serious when the time calls for it. \\n\\n\r\nDuring is part time work at her shop Yuku inadvertently helps Watanuki in daily trials and dealing with his gifts. Watanuki also finds friends who accept his strange gifts. Along the way he befriends a  Shinto Priest in training who helps ward off the demons that Watanuki seems to attract.\\n\\n\r\nShizuka D\u014dmeki:   is Watanuki's classmate and one-sided rival. He is part of the school's archery club and often participates in school competitions. He lives in a shrine owned by his late grandfather. D\u014dmeki's personality sharply contrasts with Watanuki's, as he is calm and often sarcastic. D\u014dmeki has the ability to rid evil spirits and is immune to most curses, mostly due to his ancestry and his upbringing in his grandfather's temple.\\n\\n\r\nWatanuki at first disdains Domeki kun but eventually appreciates his presence in most things unless he tries in interferer with his love interest that is... \\n\\n\r\nHimawari Kunogi:   Watanuki's main love interest. She is a kind and caring girl, but inadvertently brings bad luck to everyone she comes into contact with, with the exception of her parents and D\u014dmeki.\\n\\n\r\nMusic:   Excellent, the background music was perfect at all time and I loved the theme songs. The Credits song was okay, but the intro won out :)\\n\\n\r\nArt:   I loved the artwork, it could have been touched up or more vibrant, but for this anime it definitely suited the dark atmosphere.

I even showed this show to my friend, who also FELL ASLEEP. What is it about this show that is so dreadful, well...\r\nThe story revolves around a boy named Watanuki who has the uncanny ability see generic, uninspired spirits. He runs into Yuuko who runs a stupid and useless store, in which I have no idea how she would be able to obtain any sort of decent revenue. Maybe she sells drugs as a sidejob? From there, there really isn't even a story, just a mash of random and uninteresting events.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in xxxholic is hideous. All the characters are extremely lanky and pencil thin to the point that they are unattractive to look at. The main character, Watanuki is one of the worst characters ever conceived and is an extremely annoying protagonist who easily gets on my nerves.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I don't recommend xxxHolic to anyone. It is a bland unimaginative show that needs to be thrown in the trash. The only reason to watch xxxHolic, is if you are having trouble sleeping.",

It shows how greed brings loss, lies can be fatal and how love andfriendship can save.\r\nThe story is about extra-ordinary events in Watanuki's life such as meeting creatures seen from folk and fairy tales and exploring different grounds known only from myth books, while working as a part-timer in a mysterious shop of Ichihara Yuuko, the witch thatgrants wishes for a price.\\n\\n\r\nIf you noticed how I emphasized this anime as a masterpiece, it's because I've never seen an anime done a marvelous job in connecting fantasy and reality than this one.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding it's art and character, the design was good especially in creating Ichihara Yuuko (my favorite CLAMP character), the CLAMP expressed well how an Elegant Witch would be.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I enjoyed the most is how every conflict was ended by a conclusion from Yuuko.

We're watching it in anime club now.\r\nAk: Is it good?\r\nNK: I enjoyed it the first time around.  Now that I'm rewatching it, I'm noticing some parts are still pretty funny, and others aren't as funny as I remember them.\r\nAk: But, this is in Japanese, right?\r\nNK: Yeah.  The first time I watched it in English, so it's interesting to compare the two.\r\nAk: Whaddya think of the voices so far?\r\nNK: Hmm...I liked a lot of the English voices better because they brought out more of the character.  Yuuko's especially.The lines in the Japanese version seem to be a bit funnier, though.\\n\\n\r\nAk: Did that change your favorite character?\\n\r\nNK: Nope.  I never really had a single favorite character to begin with.  The interactions between the characters is better than each character individually.  Mokona and Yuuko especially.\\n\\n\r\nAk: You like the art?\\n\r\nNK: I'm not especially fond of the art.  The characters look...strange, to say the least.  Even Mokona looks weird when it opens its eyes.  Kinda creepy, actually.\\n\\n\r\nAk: What about the music?\\n\r\nNK: Never really paid attention to the music the first time.  It's actually pretty good.  I like the theme now that I've listened to it a few times.\\n\\n\r\nAk: You think I would like it?\\n\r\nNK: Not sure.  It has a lot of dark moments amongst the funny ones, being a story about the supernatural and all.  Plus, it explains a lot of things in a very strange way that just leaves more questions unanswered.  It's still a good series, and even if you watch it for the funny moments, there's enough there to keep you humored.\\n\\n\r\nAk: Wait, why'd you watch it in the first place?  It doesn't sound like something you'd normally watch...\\n\r\nNK: The story's by CLAMP, the same group that did Cardcaptor Sakura, Chobits, Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle.  It's a pretty long story as to why I actually started watching it, but I'm sure I'll explain it to you eventually.\\n\\n\r\nAk: If it's CLAMP, then why doesn't it look the same?\\n\r\nNK: That's because xxxHolic has a different artist, even though it's the same group of people.  The interesting thing is that there are a lot of objects littered throughout Yuuko's shop from other CLAMP series.  Fai's staff makes an appearance, and I believe you see Kinomoto Sakura's staff at one point as well.  The headphones Watanuki uses in episode 3 should also look quite familiar to CLAMP fans.\\n\\n\r\nAk: Should I watch those other series then?\\n\r\nNK: You don't have to, though technically xxxHolic runs parallel to Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle.  It never directly references TRC, though.  Just a few random objects here and there.\\n\\n\r\nAk: Where do you rank it?  Is it your favorite?\\n\r\nNK: Not by a long shot.  I enjoyed it, but not on the level of a 9 or a 10.  It's one of those good-not-great series.  Some people will like it, some people won't.  I'm one of the ones that does like it.",

Captivating and with unexpected rezolve, the most interesting thing being the fact that if you wish to grant your wish you must give something of equal value (and I'm not talking about money).\\n\r\nNot very much action, but still a pretty nice complex story.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork - The artwork at first seems simple, but as you continue to watch you get the feeling that it's like an ukyo-e (art of the fleeting world) especialy when inside the spirit world or the shop (the way the smoke is drawn, the symbol of the moon, yuuko's clothes (which I absolutely adore) (although not all of them, some being vicotian, modern, a lot of styles(you can see it better in the manga)\\n\r\nI also enjoyed the butterfly symbol how it was drawn and its segnificance.\\n\\n\r\nSound- openings definetely loved them, endings not so much and also \"Lost memory\"(very sand and beautiful from the ost)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- At first you think that the characters aren't so complex, but as the story goes on and you discover more about each of them, you begin to realise that each of them were created with a purpose.\\n\r\nMy favourite character would definetely be miss Yuuko Ichihara because of her dual personality, or maybe she has that misterious, serious and all knowing gaze all the time and the fooling around laughing and getting drunk part is only for show. Who knows? But she is definetely very interesting and would never get you bored.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this show is definetelly worth watching, as it opens up your mind, makes you thing about life and everything that surrounds you and also teaches about some of the japanese folklore.

            "content": "xxxHolic is an anime I just finished not long ago. It's based on the manga of the same name by CLAMP. It is also a spin-off of another CLAMP famous anime/manga, called Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle.\r\nThe story is basically about a guy called Watanuki who can see spirits and other supernatural things. One day, while he is being chased by a spirit, he finds himself entering a store with no reason. Once he enters, he meets Yuuko, the owner of the store. He finds out that it's not a normal store, but a store that grants wishes for a cost. Watanuki asks Yuuko to get ridof his ability to see spirits, so they can't chase him anymore, but in order to get his wish granted, Watanuki has to start working in the store.\\n\\n\r\nThat's basically the main plot. It may not sound as interesting as it is, but in every episode, something new happens. For example, an episode can be about a girl who is always negative about things, or about a girl who always lies, etc. Those persons with problems somehow get to meet Watanuki and you can see how what they do reflects in their lives, and how Watanuki tries to help them. All of this is developed with a paranormal touch, for example being negative can attract negative thing, and stuff like that.\\n\\n\r\nThe series is episodic, but really interesting, with every episode bringing something new, and a few 2-episodes arcs here and there which leave you in suspense.\\n\\n\r\nWatanuki and Yuuko aren't the only characters however. Doumeki is Watanuki's friend and he can repel spirits, but he can't see them. Even when he is Watanuki's best friend, Watanuki is always fighting with him. He has a very calm personality, which differs from Watanuki's, and he's very popular with girls.\\n\\n\r\nHimawari is the girl Watanuki likes, and she's a very good friend with Watanuki and Doumeki, but Watanuki doesn't dare confess her his love.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the series is really good. The only thing that people think keeps it from reaching it's full potential is the art style. Something else people complain about is that minor characters just look like shadows, with no face.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally I don't really care about the art since the anime is so great and just feels so mystical at times.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is also amazing, with some awesome tracks that always make you feel what the anime wants you to feel. Most tracks were good IMO.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, this is an awesome anime, don't hesitate to watch it now\\n\\n",

            "content": "On the technical side of things, I have many bones to pick with the art and animation here. Actually there are too many bones to pick out on these spaghetti people, who I feel like I could easily snap across my thumb if I ever pat them on the back, even the supernaturally voluptuous Yuuko. Seriously, that woman should have SPINAL PROBLEMS with a rack of that magnitude on that beanpole, and throughout the entire series\u2019 run, I never got used to the tiny-headed, long-bodied creatures they call people in this show, or the way they move either. Really fluid animation could have compensated forthis bizarre art style, maybe even made it really cool, but the animation here is middling at best, and oftentimes slips into shaky and poor. It\u2019s just unsettling. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is wickedly haunting and appropriate, and compensates for the limited animation well in some episodes where it\u2019s dearly needed. Actually, the music is pretty top-tier, especially when the mood calls for SCARY! \\n\\n\r\nThe dub is actually easier on the ears than the original Japanese and this is mostly due to the soothing liquidity in Yuuko and Doumeki\u2019s voicework. It was wise of them to play their characters so rich and low, because Watanuki is the most incredibly annoying little goober I\u2019ve ever heard. I\u2019m not saying the acting is bad, because Watanuki\u2019s clearly supposed to reach that ungodly level of spastic that he does and sometimes it\u2019s really funny, but MORE often, oh gosh, I just want to send him to that little internment camp in Japan where they keep all the School Rumble characters so they can whip him into shape. Still, there\u2019s no big difference between the language tracks, so preferences will just split where they always do. Oh, one of these days I\u2019ll get to slam some bad voice acting\u2026but not yet.\\n\\n\r\nThis series really isn\u2019t bad for wasting time on, but the fact that I have to use the word \u201cwasting\u201d probably indicates how original or striking it is. Most of the adventures of Yuuko and company are underwhelming and talky enough to turn a two minute neat idea into a twenty minute \u201cwhat the heck was that?\u201d Let\u2019s just say that Yuuko has a very particular way of looking at the world, and her routine cautionary speeches can become grating at best, and childishly elementary or just plain stupid in a pretty package at worst. Occasionally, Yuuko would state some grand moral that REALLY rubbed me the wrong way, and given how much she has to say, I imagine that this will be the case for most viewers at one point or another. \\n\\n\r\nMixed in with all these middling ideas, there are a few glowing gems, though, I can\u2019t deny that. Episodes involving a snowball fight where the snowmen do the battling, and a shoutout episode to the famous short story, \u201cThe Monkey\u2019s Paw,\u201d are a few among them. Still, I\u2019m talking roughly an eighth of the episodes are really memorable. xxxHolic relies far too much on these tired platitudes and more tired running gags like Yuuko always being drunk and/or hung over and Watanuki going off on Doumeki like a pasty-white cherry bomb. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a shame because we really want to know more about Watanuki\u2019s gift and what it has to do with the death of his parents, his friendship with Doumeki, and most importantly, his \u201cdestined\u201d servitude to Yuuko. It\u2019s something that is constantly foreshadowed but never revealed to even the smallest extent, in favor of more Hogwarts-esque hijinks. Sometimes all an episode will have going for it is a fun little reference to one of CLAMP\u2019s many other series, and if that\u2019s a draw, you know you\u2019re in trouble story-wise.\\n\\n\r\nSo, while there\u2019s fun to be had, the basic fact is that everything xxxHolic attempts, the style and the spirit, or spirits, if you wanna get all punny, has been done much better in different shows with higher budgets. (Kino\u2019s Journey, Mushi-Shi, Galaxy Express 999) As such, while not at all bad, this is the first show I\u2019ve reviewed that I can\u2019t honestly recommend. It\u2019s tearfully AVERAGE in every way possible. A ghost, if you will, of what it seems to promise.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, xxxHolic leaps out as visually strange and narratively exciting, but it\u2019s a hollow fa\u00e7ade hiding a frequently boring show.\\n\\n\r\n*THIS IS A PARTIAL TRANSCRIPT OF MY VIDEO REVIEW WHICH CAN BE FOUND HERE: \\n\\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJMlYfyErY\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!",

            "content": "Funny, creepy, dark, interesting and clever. Those would be the words that could describe this anime.\r\nIt&rsquo;s funny &ndash; thanks to Watanuki&rsquo;s wild antics as well as Mokona&rsquo;s drunkenness. Creepy &ndash; mostly because it scared the heck out of me sometimes (especially episode 10, 12 and 24). Dark, because it presents the world in a way that people rarely see. It&rsquo;s interesting &ndash; you get hooked into it and you actually become an xxxHOLIC-holic. Finally, it&rsquo;s clever because it doesn&rsquo;t take the viewers for fools.\r\nThe characters are just great. Doumeki and Watanuki are yin and yang. They always seem to have this love-hate comedy routine whereinDoumeki says one thing then it annoys Watanuki right off the bat, then Himawari comments on how close they are. I also like Yuuko. I am always amazed by her wisdom and how she takes on her job. I think the concept of just compensation in something other than money is very clever. I like her here more, instead of the Yuuko from TRC. The black Mokona cracks me up as well even though I&rsquo;m a tad bothered that he&rsquo;s not as well mannered as the white Mokona.\\n\\n\r\nProduction IG&rsquo;s work was a bit interesting. The visuals seemed off to me sometimes, but there&rsquo;s something about it that keeps me watching. I didn&rsquo;t like the colors though, since most of it was concentrated on the main characters/elements. The background elements seemed a bit dull sometimes. I did like the demon parade episode, because the scenes were more vivid than usual. As expected of CLAMP, the characters have slightly deformed body types and tall and stringy characters. I guess it&rsquo;s what separates them from others.\\n\\n\r\nI&rsquo;m not familiar too with the three main seiyuu, but I think they did a splendid job. Jun Fukuyama was very entertaining as Watanuki. Sayaka Ohara&rsquo;s mature, sultry and womanly voice fit Yuuko&rsquo;s personality really well and Kazuya Nakai&rsquo;s voice was also well suited to Doumeki&rsquo;s character. Of course, Mika Kikuchi was very entertaining as Mokona as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe music was very much like the plot &ndash; a bit dark, but contemporary. I like the catchy opening theme (19sai), the cutesy first ending theme (Reason), and the j-rock second ending theme (Kagerou). The BGM really helped in making things a lot more creepier too.\\n\\n\r\nI&rsquo;m really glad that I found the time to watch the series. I have to say that this is my favorite CLAMP series by far &ndash; mostly because the CLAMP series I&rsquo;ve seen haven&rsquo;t impressed me as much as xxxHOLIC. I&rsquo;ll end this review with Yuuko&rsquo;s words that resonated throughout the series &ndash; There is no such thing as coincidence in this world. There is only the inevitable.",

            "content": "Prepare to be taken on a tour de force through the world of the supernatural. Or maybe just a regular tour. I wouldn't know. Having only recently experienced the genre of \"supernatural\" anime, xxxHOLiC (hereby referred to as simply \"Holic\") was a breath of fresh air from my usual action/fantasy fare.\r\nThe story behind Holic is intriguing and interesting, revolving around spirits, ghosts, and the very strange. Geared towards an older and more sophisticated audience, there's little action, but loads of thought-provoking and amazingly insightful dialogue. Holic is the kind of anime that gets your mind pumping about topics such as fate, destiny, and one's purposein life. Plus, there's a side to it that makes statements about how people live and society in general. Not to mention that it's educational as well. Holic offers an insight into a part of Japanese culture that most people rarely see. \\n\\n\r\nConcerning the plot, however, Holic is another anime that is driven by episodic events. There seems to be no real overall direction for the story. Normally, this would leave me feeling slightly cheated and unsatisfied, but after surviving through the likes of Ouran and the Wallflower, I've come to accept that the episodic plot system is a genre on its own and it's here to stay.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, a plot that doesn't know where it's going hurts any character development. The characters are well made, with their own distinct personalities, but stay relatively the same throughout the course of the plot.  No one shows very much significant growth. Granted, everyone is wiser and better, having learned the lessons distributed throughout 24 episodes of madness. Perhaps that's the elusive character growth that I've been looking for?\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of artwork, the artistic foundations were laid down in the manga by the increasingly popular mangaka group CLAMP. And they've done a very good job. Yuuko's wardrobe is definitely something to pay attention to (ahem), and though everyone has ridiculously long arms, legs, and necks, it actually provides a sense of levity in a serious setting (that, and the alcoholism). Alas, there's a slight issue with the fact that only the characters important to the plot are actually drawn in. Any bodies that are only required to be &quot;fillers&quot; (like a bunch of random people at a supermarket) are not colored and lack faces. In my opinion, it has symbolic meaning, but it could also be attributed to pure laziness. Dunno which to choose.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and speaking of laziness, the sound was great. Loved the opening theme, but didn't really pay attention to the background music. Voice-acting was top notch, especially with all the high pitched and slightly unique voices coming from characters like Mokona, Maru, and Moro. That is all.\\n\\n\r\nIn the enjoyment section: I finished Holic in the space of a week, and indeed, I was completely hooked. I savored every bit of supernatural strangeness, and I'll be looking for more with the second season.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, Holic certainly isn't unique, for there seems to be an ever-growing list of anime that deal with the supernatural, the occult, and just really weird stuff in general. But as a starter series for the newly-converted, it's definitely worth watching.",

            "content": "Surprisingly enough, xxxHolic is the first request I've had for a Clamp review. For those of you who aren't familiar with the group, they're an all female group who started out writing doujinshi before moving on to professional work in 1987. They've been fairly prolific, but their end products tend to range considerably in quality. Some being spectacular, others being terrible. xxxHolic leans toward the latter.\r\nxxxHolic is an anime that doesn't have an underlying plot so much as a series of loosely connected episodes that are all based off of Japanese folk lore. A young man named Watanuki can see spirits. He finds a shopthat grants wishes and ends up working there part time. Shenanigans ensue. Most of the episodes have only very loose connections to each other. An anime can be setup like this and still be well done, but xxxholic isn't. One major issue that pops up multiple times is that serious moments, which should have some impact on the characters or the plots to come, are dropped and never mentioned again instead. Another issue is that the episodes don't really do anything interesting with the folklore. Instead it just throws the reference at you, follows up with some faux intellectual statement to wrap things up and moves on to the next thing. The comedic aspect is another area where it fails since there are very few moments that are actually funny. Most of the humour is based on Watanuki having really over the top reactions to what's going on and it's not particularly funny when they do it the first time. So doing it multiple times every bloody episode just gets repetitive and really boring. The semi-serious moments they try to have are also ruined by them always reverting to \"comedy\" quickly after those moments end. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters certainly don't make up for the largely absent plot. Each one has one or two exaggerated personality traits that define them. Watanuki over-reacts to things and is a tool. Doumeki helps Watanuki and has no visible reaction to anything. Himawari either doesn't understand the obvious or toys with Watanuki for fun. Yuuko always knows what's happening but only deals with issues personally when she has too. She also drinks a lot. And I just described the four major characters completely with a few adjectives. I could do the same for the secondary characters, but that would take a while. One other issue with the characters is that there are several plot lines involving individual characters that seem like they could potentially lead to development, but they either get dropped or go unresolved in favour of keeping the status quo.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is terrible. I'm used to borked proportions in anime, but xxxHolic just takes it too far. The characters have ludicrously long and slim limbs and bodies with tiny little heads. This makes them look more like models made out of string cheese than actual people. The backgrounds are generally sparse and the supernatural beings don't have much impact. They just look bland most of the time. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice work is difficult to judge. There are a lot of really talented voice actors working on this such as Nakai Kazuya, Ohara Sayaka, Itou Shizuka and Fukuyama Jun but they all adopt these really exaggerated voices which add to the lack of depth for their characters. I blame the direction since I know that all of them can do roles with depth. The music ranges from bad to generic. \\n\\n\r\nThe yuri factor is a 2.4/10. Simply because Yuuko gets really touchy with some of the other female characters and it comes off as a bit homoerotic. \\n\\n\r\nMy final rating for xxxHolic is a 3/10. The art is bad. The characters have no depth. It's not funny and what little story there is lacks interesting content. If you want a good anime grounded in Japanese myths there are far better options like Mushishi or Kino's Journey. If you want something by Clamp specifically there are still better anime, like Magic Knight Rayearth or Cardcaptor Sakura. As for xxxHolic, you can skip it.",

Note that this review will only be about the first season, but rest assured that I will get to the other installments. \\n\\n\r\nSTORY - 7\\n\\n\r\nxxxHOLiC is the story of a high school boy\u2019s encounters with the supernatural after being taken in as an apprentice by a rather odd employer who claims to grant wishes. That pretty much sums it up. Nothing more, nothing less.\\n\\n\r\nPacing-wise, this is where xxxHOLiC shines.\\n\\n\r\nEpisodic shows are a double-edged blade. On one hand, they excel stylistically by putting the characters in various scenarios of differing themes, thus granting an expansion of premise and necessary character development. On the other, each episode has an individual story which allows little room to move the overarching plot along. It isn\u2019t one unified narrative, but a collection of short stories; each with their own style, conflict, and lesson. For the first season at least, xxxHOLiC may not have a sense of plot direction yet but it takes full advantage of its pacing in displaying its brand of weird charm, unsettling atmosphere, and surprising insight. You get goosebumps on one episode, ponder on another, and smile after the next. The episodic pacing in this show makes it seem like a slice-of-life show more than anything, incorporating elements of supernatural, horror, suspense, comedy, and romance along the way. \\n\\n\r\nART - 8\\n\\n\r\nTwo words: Character design.\\n\\n\r\nWhen you have characters that have the average height of a professional basketball player, hands as big as their head, arms as long as their legs, and virtually no muscle, you know people will love it or hate it. Fortunately, I belong to the former.\\n\\n\r\nI commend Clamp for a job well done on the zany, slenderman-like character designs. Though anatomically incorrect and disproportionate, it intensifies both wacky and tense scenes by emphasizing body movement, and exudes an exotic vibe that complements the show\u2019s eerie and mystical setting. Seeing the fleshed-out stick figure look is also reminiscent to the flat, gritty, and edgy cartoon style of the 90\u2019s which are a refreshing departure from today\u2019s smooth, vibrant, and meaty designs.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation, provided by Production I.G., is standard for a show aired on 2006. Colors are dull and faded, supernatural set pieces are smoky and oriental, lighting is dim and claustrophobic, and cinematography is still and calm. In general, the animation is\u2026 subtly off, and it works in the show\u2019s favor surprisingly well.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND - 9\\n\\n\r\nFor xxxHOLiC\u2019s sound, I\u2019ve taken into account the OP/EDs, BGM, ambient sounds, and voice acting, because all of these are worth the mention.\\n\\n\r\nFor your information, I have never skipped this show\u2019s openings and two ending songs. Not even once. I might even go as far as to say that this show\u2019s OP and first ED are one of the best I\u2019ve heard in a while. Each episode starts with an infectious funk song of quirky synthesizers, hypnotic guitars, and groovy basslines riddled with dissonant angst and regret. \u201c19sai\u201d (19 Years Old) by Shikao Suga perfectly encapsulates what xxxHOLiC is all about: an otherworldly coming-of-age story in a strange and wonderful world full of temptation and misunderstanding where everyone just wants to break free and find peace of mind. All of that is neatly wrapped in a nice little bow by the end of each episode with Fonogenico\u2019s \u201cReason,\u201d a cute and light piece of keyboard and guitar pop which resonates with the show\u2019s motif of inevitabilities; in that everything happens for a reason and embracing what has happened and what will happen is the only way to go. By the second half of the show, the show ends with Buck-Tick\u2019s \u201cKagerou\u201d (Shimmering Air), a straightforward rock song of wailing guitars and yearning vocals dominated with themes of dire escapism and obsessive attachment which fits the more serious tone of the latter half of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe BGM did an exemplary job in covering a wide array of moods while being consistent with the show\u2019s supernatural backdrop due to the songs\u2019 dreamlike quality. The instrumentation ranged from hair-raising ambient scores of distant howls, sinister chords, and violent percussions to playfully halloweenish or heartfelt synthesizer, string, and piano pieces. It became integral in defining xxxHOLiC\u2019s hauntingly eccentric yet down-to-earth nature.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s common sense that ambient sounds are supposed to match a given atmosphere. So in this case, there will be two instances when I mention ambient sound engineering; either when it stands out in a bad or good way. In xxxHOLiC, ambient sounds surprisingly affect a scene\u2019s inflection in such a way that it disconcerts the viewer even in the most mundane of scenes. The ambience rides along with the show\u2019s animation by exhibiting a nuance that there\u2019s always something wrong, despite a given context being normal and safe. xxxHOLiC gains this added horror/suspense edge even if that isn\u2019t necessarily what the show is all about. But like the BGM, it immensely aids in immersion and made the setting darker without feeling unnatural to the show\u2019s premise. Because let\u2019s face it, what you don\u2019t understand scares you. And the sound department did a great job of capturing the fear and awe of the supernatural experience. xxxHOLiC knows when to use silence, cut off sound, modulate voices, and mix in subtle noises, whispers, and sounds to enhance the profound yet dubious undertone lying beneath the show\u2019s innocent exterior. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting expressed each character\u2019s key trait very well. The lovably annoying Watanuki gets an incessant high-pitched voice that hushes down on the show\u2019s more solemn moments. Deadpan Doumeki remains a deep and monotone pitch all throughout but can give off a softer vibe while still keeping his cool. Yuuko\u2019s voice completely captivates the ears; shifting from immature exuberance to alluring sultriness while maintaining a neutral and elusive stance. Maru, Moro, and Mokona keep up with the playful high-pitched voice to even out the show\u2019s somber tendencies. Himawari\u2019s typical schoolgirl voice is cute and unassuming. Let\u2019s just leave it at that.  The characters often change in every episode with these being the main recurring characters with ample screen time.\\n\\n\r\nP.S. The dub wasn\u2019t really my cup of tea. Todd Haberkorn\u2019s Watanuki turned the lovably annoying character into a whining wuss.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS - 7\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in xxxHOLiC are similar to that of a fairy tale. They are very distinct from one another and portray a striking personality all throughout the series to fulfill each of their respective roles. \\n\\n\r\nWatanuki is the ceaselessly complaining and hardworking nice guy we all know and love. Doumeki is the dull and straightforward jock as well as Watanuki\u2019s polar opposite and comic foil. Together, they banter their way into their own supernatural misadventures under the watchful eye of Yuuko. Occasionally joining them in their struggle to address Yuuko\u2019s customers (if they aren\u2019t doing various odd jobs), we have:\\n\\n\r\nMaru and Moro, a jolly pair of kids serving Yuuko. Mokona, Clamp\u2019s bunny-like mascot that serves as Yuuko\u2019s mischievous friend and drinking buddy. And Himawari, Watanuki\u2019s ditzy and innocent love interest. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest are either the shop\u2019s customers or supernatural entities involved.\\n\\n\r\nInteractions between the main cast can get formulaic and most of the character development can only be credited to Watanuki. His character development was more personal than substantial. It wasn\u2019t a noticeable growth spurt nor a radical shift in ideals. It was more of a hushed voice within the character telling him that he learned something that he still can\u2019t fully comprehend. Though lacking well-roundedness and middle ground, the characters were all lovable and relatable, with both the humans and the supernatural having independent and realistic ideals. The huge cast of episode-specific characters also left a memorable impact which made up for their static personality.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT - 9\\n\\n\r\nAs you can already tell, I love this show. It was like watching a more light-hearted yet more sinister version of The Addams Family with all the grim and whimsical energy evident in the show\u2019s production. With constant references to superstition and common social stigma, it provided enough realism to make it accessible and understandable compared to most supernatural lore. What it lacked in plot direction, it made up for in style, immersion, and groundedness. But what really left a lasting impression on me was the insight.\\n\\n\r\nxxxHOLiC tells us how little we understand life, society, and ourselves. How learning, growing and transforming into something better means going outside our comfort zone and exploring the world. How meeting different people with various problems helps us understand that there is nothing good or evil. How inherently selfish and fickle we are. \\n\\n\r\nUltimately, how strange it is to be human. \\n\\n\r\nWe are riddled with inconsistencies and flaws which drive us to suffering and bitter realization. And in those moments when we are most vulnerable, we understand how beautiful it is to feel pain and embrace reality. We bask in our imperfection and eccentricity because it is what defines us.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - 8\\n\\n\r\nxxxHOLiC is a wondrous, uncanny, frisky, and sentimental ride through the life and times of Watanuki, a highschool boy blessed and cursed with the blood that attracts spirits. It deserves praise, not for overwhelming the viewer with something revolutionary, but for telling a story that says something about ourselves. Maybe I\u2019m just putting too much thought into this. Overall, the show was simple, yet clever in its execution to deliver the full force of its content. As for where that content is going, I\u2019m eager to find out in the next season.",

None of the \"scary\" stories would ever cause one to think twice about how ominous they are, let alone keep one up at night. The characters are so annoying and they say the same thing over and over, so many times in each episode that it will start to bother you. In my opinion the art design is lacking. WORST of all, after watching xxxHOLiC Kei, Rou, and Shunmuki there is no plot at all.

Two characters whos fate has intertwined. xxxHOLiC is a collection of different strange yet interesting stories which happens to produce a happy ending on every episode. One particular viewer would learn something from the episodes of xxxHOLiC. It's about the mistake of humans and the solution to them were given by the main character \"Yuuko\". I'd say that some episodes were mediocre but interesting enough. \r\nArt\r\n- Production IG was involved, judging the fact that this anime were made in theyear 2006, I'd say that the animation is somewhat outdated. I'm not saying that it is that bad, it's just that there's nothing special about the animation. The characters stays on their intentionally deformed shape. It's not that bad really.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\n- I like the BGM used in this anime. It is ingeniously used in every episode and fits the whole episode inside out. The group behind the BGM is SENS project and they're really good. They really did portray the word &quot;Mysterious&quot; in their works and it is really notable. Some scores were relaxing, one track I liked is shizuka na hibi. The OP is good and the ED &quot;Reason&quot; is love XDD. Everyone would enjoy listening to the music used in xxxHOLiC.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\n-There are different characters with different situations. Most of the characters bears different sins and after they consult Yuuko, they seem to vanish for Yuuko grants their wish to cleanse their sins and live normally. One would relate to one or two characters or even more in xxxHOLiC. In short, xxxHOLiC portrays the problems of today and how to solve them, this is one factor that I've noticed and cherished most. That's why I gave it this score.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\n-It's enjoyable and relaxing. Although there are some scary episodes, it's not like you'll brood and will never sleep about it, the scare factor here is mild don't worry. This anime will relax you and you'll learn different lessons about life, sins and the pain they bring.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\n-The second season is coming out, what are you waiting for? grab xxxHOLiC. It's worth your time and I hope you will enjoy this anime just like I did.",

            "content": "Oh CLAMP! I&rsquo;ve always loved their works; there is (albeit, sometimes misguided) sincerity in their stories that many other anime/manga can&rsquo;t quite manage. An example of this is in the second episode that revolved around a girl with a pinky problem. It is revealed that it&rsquo;s not mere limb stiffness, because to Yuuko and Watanuki, they see that she has a trail of black smoke coming out from her finger. The episode goes to reveal what the black smoke is about and the type of life this girl leads. There is obvious social commentary going on, and in a very CLAMP-esque way, rather than anyform of judgement, it is simply an observation into human behaviour and how people cope with living.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style was something I had to get used to. Everyone in xxxHOLiC has tremendously long limbs, which makes them really tall. I guess it makes it stand out compared to other more glossy, better-proportioned anime series out there. It&rsquo;s pretty amusing how bosomy Yuuko is and how some of her many costumes shows it off off quite unabashedly. :P\\n\\n\r\nAs for characters, I really don&rsquo;t care for Watanuki too much. He&rsquo;s always so neurotic and prone to making a ruckus over the smallest things. However, as the main character, he gets the most character development, so that does make him difficult to hate. The other characters are prone to be kind of one-dimensional and can be summed up with a sentence. Watanuki&rsquo;s love interest is cute, pretty and sweet and his rival/friend is stoic, dependable and more silent than not. I guess my favourite character is definitely Yuuko. While she doesn&rsquo;t vary much from polarising from being mysterious and thoughtful, to being a spontaneous drunk, the former quality makes her very interesting. Character exploration is not too big in xxxHOLiC, but if you don&rsquo;t mind the existing, albeit archetypal, character types, then it shouldn&rsquo;t be a problem.\\n\\n\r\nCLAMP&rsquo;s attempt at humour works at times but it&rsquo;s not a consistent thing. I personally don&rsquo;t find it very funny whenever Watanuki gets all slapstickishly angry about something, but at times it does surprise me with how funny and adorable some of the characters are at times. But if you&rsquo;re looking for consistent humour, this anime probably would not fit the bill.\\n\\n\r\nxxxHOLiC is great if you want a well-paced, episodic anime that has somewhat of a focus on exploring social phenomena and human behaviour through a fate/destiny, supernatural light. Sometimes touching, often spooky, kooky and clever. Each episode, while it may not be gripping plot-wise, is one that leaves you wondering what the next episode would be about.",

            "content": "There are no coincidences in this world. There is only inevitability. If you find Yuko's shop, then that too was fate. It means you have a wish that can be granted. For a price of course. This is the simple premise for xxxHolic, a stylish and magical anime and manga series by CLAMP.\r\nxxxHolic is a show that tries to stimulate the viewer in many different ways. There's adventure, philosophy, plenty of comedy, and sometimes action, all with a distinctly CLAMPy flair. The routine nature of Watanuki's life between school and the shop allows for episodes to be largely interchangeable with no heavy storyline that coversall or even most of the season. Truth be told, Watanuki's wish to stop seeing spirits is rarely mentioned after the first episode, and it's basically just an excuse to have him start working at the shop. That's not necessarily a complaint though, because the individual stories or mini-arcs that make up the show are wholly fulfilling on their own.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough Watanuki is the protagonist, Yuko is the real star of the series and undeniably magnetic. Although her origins remain a mystery, she has enough charm and personality to keep one watching in any situation. On the surface, she playfully teases and bosses Watanuki around but seems to genuinely care about him even though she never explicitly states her feelings about... well, anything. Because Yuko is so attuned to the absolution of fate, she never gets emotional. Because Yuko is a wish granter, she doesn't help other people until they ask for and purchase her help. Even if she wanted to do otherwise, it would create an imbalance. Yet she never comes across as cold. She can be playful, aloof, serious, motherly, childish, sexy, and spontaneous.\\n\\n\r\nThe strength of xxxHolic is the way it uses colorful and whimsical events to illustrate the hidden side of human nature. Everyone who comes into the shop has a wish. It's never a shallow wish, and it's often something that is unusual or shameful. Watanuki is often confused by the problem or the solution, but Yuko explains to him many truths to life. The unspoken plot of xxxHolic is Yuko's role as a teacher to Watanuki, in result making him more of an adult. Aside from the philosophy, just being able to witness the wonderful mystical scenes of the spirit world for the first time with Watanuki is a treat.\\n\\n\r\nIf there's a downside to xxxHolic, it is probably the comedy, which comes across as cliched. Plus, they run the same gags into the ground again and again. One can't help but notice how Watanuki happily spazzes out every time the girl he has a crush on, Himawari, smiles at him. Then, his rival/friend Doumeki shows up, says one or two words, and Watanuki spazzes angrily with cartoonish exuberance. This is a scene you'll find in almost every episode of xxxHolic through both seasons. It's unfortunate that such a large amount of the show is comedy, because those parts are very run-of-the-mill.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is largely what you might expect from CLAMP, which is good to me, but everyone has REALLY long and skinny arms, legs, and torsos, to the point where Watanuki looks like a spider when he bends his legs. So while I wouldn't call most of the characters attractive, the style fits the show. The animation is minimized in a lot of scenes and episodes, and it's easy to see that when you contrast the first season to the second season which has improved production values. But it absolutely doesn't hurt the show very much.\\n\\n\r\nFor me, the complete attraction to xxxHolic is hard to summarize. It's a stylish feel, a mood, a charisma that the entire show gives off that kept me watching from beginning to end. It's the tension when Yuko shares a cup of tea with her new client. It's the relaxed feeling when Doumeki and Watanuki participate in the annual monster procession. It's the creeping madness of the owner of a monkey's paw. While not a perfect show by any means, it's a worthy addition to any library.",

            "content": "(Spoiler Free)\r\nA misleading title is one of my only qualms with this series. Far from being some sort of ecchi comedy, xxxHolic was one of the most thought provoking, moving, and beautiful animes I've had the pleasure of viewing.\r\nThe roots of the show are set deep in the grounds of Japanese folklore. Fans of the animated movie Spirited Away or of animes like Natsume Yuujinchou are sure to love the world of spirits and mysteries crafted in xxxHolic. \r\nThe story is mostly episodic with numerous different stories taking palce over 1 or 2 episodes each. While I usually prefer serial animes with longer arcs, xxxHolicsucceeds in connecting many of its episodes together. Instead of 20+ independant, stand-alone stories, we instead get what are more like snapshots of the characters life. Each 'picture' is different, yet all are connected and make up a larger story. Not only is this an excellent way to present a series, but each of the 20+ stories are masterpieces in and of themselves. Story earns a 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art in xxxHolic is, in my experience, unique. I personally found the original style to be completely beautiful, but not all will agree. Many find the slightly off human proprtions to be odd, and some find fault with over the top character movements. However most can agree that many of the backrounds, stories, and characters in xxxHolic are simply breathtaking. Scenic landscapes, a lantern parade of 1000 spirits, and an ever mysterious fortune teller's shop are just a handful of the many original and gorgeous scenes crafted by the show's masterful artwork. A deserved 10/10 for art in my most humble opinion.\\n\\n\r\nSound was also impressive. I, like most, don't often notice a soundtrack unless I'm listening for it. Yet the oftentimes powerful, and beautiful music of xxxHolic perfectly meshed with the art and story to create some truely moving moments. Character voicing was superb, from the exasperated voice of the protagonist to the lofty, confident tone of a fortune teller, the actors of the show did a fabulous job bringing the characters to life. And lastly, a catchy opener, and two decent endings left me smiling. Sound earns a 9/10\\n\\n\r\nMany characters in xxxHolic are familiar arcetypes. Yet even though I'd seen every character's personality and mannerisms before, I hadn't always seen depth in those characters. Specifically the protagonist who, albeit slowly and more towards the end of the series, reveals himself as a person. Meanwhile a relationship forms seamlessly with his mysterious employer, a relationship that by the end of the series becomes a real, and believable bond between the two. Characters are by no means perfect however. A few cross the line from being 'familiar' to full blown cliche, and at times, the main character can be somewhat of a brat. Overall however the cast in xxxHolic carry the story well. An 8/10 for character.\\n\\n\r\nI loved the series from start to finish. The beautiful stories, the sporadic, but no less enjoyable humor, and the overall depth of the show were simply incredible, and a joy to watch. Enjoyment earns a solid 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall xxxHolic earns a 9/10 and my eager reccomendation. Beautiful art and stories that range from scary, to hilarious, to proverbial combined with solid characters and sound make this an anime well worth looking into.",

            "content": "Where do I begin with this amazing anime? I suppose I'll start with the lowest rated category: Story. The reason this is so low, is well, bluntly, there isn't much of a story. The first episode segways into the rest of the show, and is more of an excuse than anything to at least make sense of the series. There's very little persistence throughout the story, other than tiny character progression. Each episode is typically unrelated to the previous one. Now, although there isn't plot, that's not necessarily a bad thing. Each episode is unique from one another, aside from the typical antics of Watanukiand Domoki. Seemingly, in every episode, there's a philosophical idea behind it. I feel like, with each episode, a life lesson is taught. The dialogue is superb, and it feels like each word spoken actually means something. Many of Yuukos teachings to Watanuki are applicable to real life, and if you truly think about them, can change your life. The final episode might leave you wanting more, but you have to realize what this anime is. It's not about the destination, it's about the journey, and what you've taken away from it. Sure, you could watch this anime for pure entertainment purposes, Watanuki, Mocona, Domoki, all the characters are hilarious! But, the mature themes this anime addresses in such a light hearted tone is truly a work of art.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of art, there's not much to talk about. The character's extremities are blown way out of proportion. It is what it is, I suppose it adds a unique spin on the quite regular locations where the anime takes place. The one really interesting thing about the artwork though, is that any non-essential character to the episode isn't colored, and isn't detailed. They  have no face, no distinguishable clothes from each other(as in variety) ,  or any vibrance to them whatsoever. Now, this may be seen from a lack of funding/laziness perspective, but to me it really adds to the whole feel of the philosophical side. They don't change the anime in any way, so it doesn't matter what they look like, or what they wear. Very much so like in real life. There is really only one complaint you can have about this series, and that would be the actual animation. It can be choppy at times, but truly doesn't count as a negative in my opinion. It's not a fast paced anime, there's practically never any action, so higher framerate animations wouldn't add much to the series. Just my 2 cents.\\n\\n\r\nOnto the sound, fantastic. Numerous times throughout the anime characters will be walking around in a crowded area, like a mall or courtyard. The ambient chatter and conversations are always present when you'd expect them. Footsteps aplenty, making the environment always feel real.  I guess voice acting would fall under this category, so I must say, it was superb. Honestly, top notch voice acting on Watanuki. The first episode had me crying from laughter at the sincerity with which the voice actor portrayed in his voice. You can tell the emotion is there, from Himawari's schoolgirl innocent-esque, to Yuuko's deep, sophisticated delivery. These voice actors absolutely nailed their parts, and made the characters extremely life like, and made the world  entirely believable.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves are well thought out, though interaction between them can be muddy at times (Watanuki's seemingly irrational hate for Domoki). This can easily be forgotten though, as it is hyperbole for the sake of comedy. Each individual character though, is different from the others, and contrast with the others very well. Each one of them  has a distinct characteristic that makes them unique, Domoki's indifference, Watanuki's passion,  Yuuko's intelligence, and Himowari's innocence.  I suppose each one represent's an element of human  behavior, and the relations between them show how we have conflicting emotions within us at all times. I'm no philosopher, so enough about that.\\n\\n\r\nMy overall enjoyment of xxxHOLiC was through the roof. I honestly was ecstatic when I found out xxxHOLic Kei was the sequel,  because I can't get enough of this series. From Watanuki's always present sarcastic remarks, to the intelligent philosophical intrigues from Yuuko, this whole series amazed me.  I honestly don't understand how you can pack so much into just one anime. It has the perfect blend of comedy, and brilliance, which don't typically go hand in hand, at least not very well. I felt like each episode taught me something new about myself, and left me pondering life with the questions Yuuko arose  many times throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you're looking for a clever plot with thought-out character progression, look elsewhere, because there's little to none in xxxHOLiC. But, if you are looking for a mature anime, that's extremely entertaining, look no further.",

The Credits song was okay, but the intro won out :)\r\nArt_ I loved the artwork, it could have been touched up or more vibrant, but for this anime it definitely suited the dark atmosphere. The detailed kimonas, the cat like eyes, everything was perfectly in place. The way they did Yuuko's hair so beautifully. \r\nThe Subject: Most then anything I enjoyed the offbeat plot. Most of the themes in this series revolved around bad vices and good vices and what control we really have over them. All in allit's the type of story that makes you think and has in impact whether you take it lightly or not. There can be a deeper meaning. For those who like to delve into the darker side of the human psyche this would be a perfect anime for you watch. Wise tales can be told in fiction..\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nWatanuki Kimihiro:   is a typical high-school student living on his own because his parents were lost at a young age. He is down-to-earth and selfless, however some what of a loner. Also since he was a small he has has the ability to see and hear spirits.\\n\\n\r\nThe story seems to jump write into the plot line within the first few minutes. At once it is a typical scholastic student heading home from school when suddenly he is surrounded by demons, unknown to the casual observer; he becomes weighed down in all this supernatural power. Some how he manages to find refuge in a strange shop he hadn't noticed before. Inside the shop is a beautiful but almost devilish woman who tell that she can grant his with to make the spirits disappear. \\n\r\nOf course with some compensation.\\n\\n\r\nYuuko Ichiharais:   a very powerful witch, mostly known for her ability to send people to other dimensions and times (sometimes called \"The Dimensional Witch\" reference from Card Captor and Tsubasa Chronicles), and for her ability to grant any wish in exchange for an equal cost. Despite her seemingly immature and free-spirited attitude, Yuuko is also sage-like and serious when the time calls for it. \\n\\n\r\nDuring is part time work at her shop Yuku inadvertently helps Watanuki in daily trials and dealing with his gifts. Watanuki also finds friends who accept his strange gifts. Along the way he befriends a  Shinto Priest in training who helps ward off the demons that Watanuki seems to attract.\\n\\n\r\nShizuka D\u014dmeki:   is Watanuki's classmate and one-sided rival. He is part of the school's archery club and often participates in school competitions. He lives in a shrine owned by his late grandfather. D\u014dmeki's personality sharply contrasts with Watanuki's, as he is calm and often sarcastic. D\u014dmeki has the ability to rid evil spirits and is immune to most curses, mostly due to his ancestry and his upbringing in his grandfather's temple.\\n\\n\r\nWatanuki at first disdains Domeki kun but eventually appreciates his presence in most things unless he tries in interferer with his love interest that is... \\n\\n\r\nHimawari Kunogi:   Watanuki's main love interest. She is a kind and caring girl, but inadvertently brings bad luck to everyone she comes into contact with, with the exception of her parents and D\u014dmeki.\\n\\n\r\nMusic:   Excellent, the background music was perfect at all time and I loved the theme songs. The Credits song was okay, but the intro won out :)\\n\\n\r\nArt:   I loved the artwork, it could have been touched up or more vibrant, but for this anime it definitely suited the dark atmosphere.

From there, there really isn't even a story, just a mash of random and uninteresting events.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in xxxholic is hideous.

We're watching it in anime club now.\r\nAk: Is it good?\r\nNK: I enjoyed it the first time around.  Now that I'm rewatching it, I'm noticing some parts are still pretty funny, and others aren't as funny as I remember them.\r\nAk: But, this is in Japanese, right?\r\nNK: Yeah.  The first time I watched it in English, so it's interesting to compare the two.\r\nAk: Whaddya think of the voices so far?\r\nNK: Hmm...I liked a lot of the English voices better because they brought out more of the character.  Yuuko's especially.The lines in the Japanese version seem to be a bit funnier, though.\\n\\n\r\nAk: Did that change your favorite character?\\n\r\nNK: Nope.  I never really had a single favorite character to begin with.  The interactions between the characters is better than each character individually.  Mokona and Yuuko especially.\\n\\n\r\nAk: You like the art?\\n\r\nNK: I'm not especially fond of the art.  The characters look...strange, to say the least.  Even Mokona looks weird when it opens its eyes.  Kinda creepy, actually.\\n\\n\r\nAk: What about the music?\\n\r\nNK: Never really paid attention to the music the first time.  It's actually pretty good.  I like the theme now that I've listened to it a few times.\\n\\n\r\nAk: You think I would like it?\\n\r\nNK: Not sure.  It has a lot of dark moments amongst the funny ones, being a story about the supernatural and all.  Plus, it explains a lot of things in a very strange way that just leaves more questions unanswered.  It's still a good series, and even if you watch it for the funny moments, there's enough there to keep you humored.\\n\\n\r\nAk: Wait, why'd you watch it in the first place?  It doesn't sound like something you'd normally watch...\\n\r\nNK: The story's by CLAMP, the same group that did Cardcaptor Sakura, Chobits, Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle.  It's a pretty long story as to why I actually started watching it, but I'm sure I'll explain it to you eventually.\\n\\n\r\nAk: If it's CLAMP, then why doesn't it look the same?\\n\r\nNK: That's because xxxHolic has a different artist, even though it's the same group of people.  The interesting thing is that there are a lot of objects littered throughout Yuuko's shop from other CLAMP series.  Fai's staff makes an appearance, and I believe you see Kinomoto Sakura's staff at one point as well.  The headphones Watanuki uses in episode 3 should also look quite familiar to CLAMP fans.\\n\\n\r\nAk: Should I watch those other series then?\\n\r\nNK: You don't have to, though technically xxxHolic runs parallel to Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle.  It never directly references TRC, though.  Just a few random objects here and there.\\n\\n\r\nAk: Where do you rank it?  Is it your favorite?\\n\r\nNK: Not by a long shot.  I enjoyed it, but not on the level of a 9 or a 10.  It's one of those good-not-great series.  Some people will like it, some people won't.  I'm one of the ones that does like it.",

I might be exaggerating, but really, its 'that'  amazing! Though I haven't  finished  reading the manga, i swear the anime was good enough that  i almost cried the hell out after I finished watching it.\r\nYuuko Ichihara really has her own way to  touch my soul,, everything she says,  every deliberate acts she do, it is as if she knew everything since the very beginning. (Indeed, she do!)\r\nWhat she says, itseems she feels the same way... it seems she could actually read one's soul. She sees right through you, she feels right through you... and every time i watched it, it makes me think,  do such person exist? I mean, she's way beyond an  existence, and for the first time in my life, after i learned about her, i realize how ignorant i am  in this damn cruel world. I hate to admit this, but she  sure was the one who enlightens me. She  was the one that makes me see the world otherwise.\\n\r\nEven with Watanuki Kimihiro,  though he is clumsy in some way (every way), he has this certain 'charisma' that makes me love him. He's one hell of a friend, a perfect friend you would want to have in your locker. (Though he didn't notice it himself). The 'bad' part about him was  he was willing to sacrifice even his own self for the sake of others... but i still like him anyway...\\n\r\nOh great... to put  it simply, xxxHolic is GREAT!",

            "content": "\"There is no such thing as a coincidence in this world, there is only the inevitable\" (as miss Yuuko Ichihara would say, this containing the essence of the anime and personally my favourite quote)\r\nIf you are into supernatural and think that there is more to the world that meets the eye and are looking for interesting characters than definetely this is you kind of anime.\r\nI first found out about this amazing work through manga and then started watching the series but it also works the other way around- you can start watching the anime and then continue with the manga- which is actually better.\r\nStory -Shortly said, you can say that the anime revolves around a shop that grants wishes, or better said around it's \"owner\" miss Yuuko Ichihara and the \"trials\" that Watanuki must go through in order to grant his wish and the wishes of others.\\n\r\n The story isn't continuous as it is formed from other smaller stories each of them very interesting to watch because in the end you realize that the vast majority of supernatural problems (unexplained accidents, ghosts, spirits) are caused from the inside out (strong feelings  that ar not shared, deep sadness, etc). Captivating and with unexpected rezolve, the most interesting thing being the fact that if you wish to grant your wish you must give something of equal value (and I'm not talking about money).\\n\r\nNot very much action, but still a pretty nice complex story.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork - The artwork at first seems simple, but as you continue to watch you get the feeling that it's like an ukyo-e (art of the fleeting world) especialy when inside the spirit world or the shop (the way the smoke is drawn, the symbol of the moon, yuuko's clothes (which I absolutely adore) (although not all of them, some being vicotian, modern, a lot of styles(you can see it better in the manga)\\n\r\nI also enjoyed the butterfly symbol how it was drawn and its segnificance.\\n\\n\r\nSound- openings definetely loved them, endings not so much and also \"Lost memory\"(very sand and beautiful from the ost)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- At first you think that the characters aren't so complex, but as the story goes on and you discover more about each of them, you begin to realise that each of them were created with a purpose.\\n\r\nMy favourite character would definetely be miss Yuuko Ichihara because of her dual personality, or maybe she has that misterious, serious and all knowing gaze all the time and the fooling around laughing and getting drunk part is only for show. Who knows? But she is definetely very interesting and would never get you bored.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this show is definetelly worth watching, as it opens up your mind, makes you thing about life and everything that surrounds you and also teaches about some of the japanese folklore. It's an anime you won't forget!",

            "content": "xxxHolic is an anime I just finished not long ago. It's based on the manga of the same name by CLAMP. It is also a spin-off of another CLAMP famous anime/manga, called Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle.\r\nThe story is basically about a guy called Watanuki who can see spirits and other supernatural things. One day, while he is being chased by a spirit, he finds himself entering a store with no reason. Once he enters, he meets Yuuko, the owner of the store. He finds out that it's not a normal store, but a store that grants wishes for a cost. Watanuki asks Yuuko to get ridof his ability to see spirits, so they can't chase him anymore, but in order to get his wish granted, Watanuki has to start working in the store.\\n\\n\r\nThat's basically the main plot. It may not sound as interesting as it is, but in every episode, something new happens. For example, an episode can be about a girl who is always negative about things, or about a girl who always lies, etc. Those persons with problems somehow get to meet Watanuki and you can see how what they do reflects in their lives, and how Watanuki tries to help them. All of this is developed with a paranormal touch, for example being negative can attract negative thing, and stuff like that.\\n\\n\r\nThe series is episodic, but really interesting, with every episode bringing something new, and a few 2-episodes arcs here and there which leave you in suspense.\\n\\n\r\nWatanuki and Yuuko aren't the only characters however. Doumeki is Watanuki's friend and he can repel spirits, but he can't see them. Even when he is Watanuki's best friend, Watanuki is always fighting with him. He has a very calm personality, which differs from Watanuki's, and he's very popular with girls.\\n\\n\r\nHimawari is the girl Watanuki likes, and she's a very good friend with Watanuki and Doumeki, but Watanuki doesn't dare confess her his love.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the series is really good. The only thing that people think keeps it from reaching it's full potential is the art style. Something else people complain about is that minor characters just look like shadows, with no face.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally I don't really care about the art since the anime is so great and just feels so mystical at times.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is also amazing, with some awesome tracks that always make you feel what the anime wants you to feel. Most tracks were good IMO.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, this is an awesome anime, don't hesitate to watch it now\\n\\n",

            "content": "The anime interpretation of CLAMP's story \"xxxHolic\" is a marvelously witty and stylishly animated look into the old saying, \"Be careful of what you wish for, because you might get it.\" High school student Watanuki is not much different from most other guys his age. He just wants to outdo his rival Doumeki, and to win the affection of a pretty girl named Himawari who is in his class. But the \"difference\" in Watanuki is a bit more \"different\" than normal, because Watanuki attracts and can see spirits, but he can't keep them from bothering him. \r\nThis \"attraction\" eventually brings Watanuki to the very mysterioushouse/shop of an agelessly beautiful witch named Yuuko, who grants wishes for a price. Yuuko takes a fancy to Watanuki and offers to eventually rid him of his problem, but for the price of having Watanuki become an unpaid servant in Yuuko's very strange household. Watanuki very quickly learns that there are many things in the world that are much stranger than the spirits that pester him, as he gains both an education in life, and an odd sort of \"family\" to replace the one that he doesn't have.\\n\\n\r\nThe \"xxxHolic\" anime excels at mixing humor, horror, romance and pathos in surprising doses and patterns. The cast of characters are likeable and intriguing, and the stories skillfully reiterate classical morality tales. Add to this a very enjoyable sound track and theme songs, and the result is a series that is memorable and demands re-watching.\\n",

            "content": "I do love this show a lot but there are some problems in it too. Inconsistencies between the manga and the anime make me cringe just a tad. Now I have not actually read the manga, but I have seen enough to find that some of the artwork is not right, but we will get to that in a moment. This is pretty much Pet Shop of Horrors with wishes and spirits; sometimes their good, and sometimes they will try to rip you apart. \r\nThe story follows a fail of a boy named Watanuki. Pretty much everything he does, he messes up with and isalways hunted down by spirits. He is the only one who can see them which makes him look like a fool most of the time when he runs around the town from spirits that seem to not exist. Now here is where some of the inconsistencies that I found. Almost every picture I have seen of him has two different eye colors but yet, the anime has given him both blue eyes. I am not sure exactly which is true but it\u2019s what I\u2019ve seen from the manga, it\u2019s supposed to be the later. (Now that I have read the manga, I found out that it happens after a event.)\\n\\n\r\nYuuko is an interesting character and from what I\u2019ve seen, they are actually alike between the manga and anime at least in looks. She has a way of getting what she wants with no worry as to what will happen to the other person although I believe she always knows it will work out. I never once saw her worried that something may happen. \\n\\n\r\nIf Watanuki wears his emotions on his sleeve, Domeki is the exact opposite. Maybe that\u2019s why they make a great pair. Domeki cancels all of Watanuki\u2019s crazy antics, giving mostly a base monotone as he speaks. I wish he was actually in the show more often and given a bigger role because it was really fun to see the conversation between him and Watanuki (and the idea of them being a yaoi pair makes my fan girl in me scream for joy...)\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, all the characters are pretty memorable as main characters except for one. Himawari is a little two plain and cheerful all the time. Sometimes I want to smack her hard because she just gets so annoying. There are many times that Yuko gives cryptic statements about her but it is never explained what is going on with her.\\n\\n\r\n I somewhat understood all that was being said but then some of what they talked about, I felt would only make sense to a Japanese person such as the game \u2018Angel\u2019 which seems to be a Japanese version of Ouija Board or Wigi Board. When they first talked about it, I thought that it was something else. Another thing that is bothersome to me is that no one takes her advice, which I understand, some of the reasons for it but then they get into problems and suffer for it and I just have to roll my eyes at it.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is alright but all the characters are much too thin and long limbed which makes it hard to watch sometimes. Even fluid movements would never make the shows good to me. There are many times when the artwork pretty much sucks for an anime, and really makes me wonder. It surprises me that such a low design could come from Clamp. In fact, the fact that there are references to other Clamp manga\u2019s in the show is interesting if you take the time to pick them out. Sadly, the only details with this seem to be in the background except one or two things the characters end up wearing and the characters themselves are poorly lacking in detail and actual proportions with arms and legs going everywhere during freak outs. I also don\u2019t like how their eyes are all blank. They have no high lights what so ever so it makes them look dead.\\n\\n\r\nI really like the English Voice acting, which to me, it\u2019s much better then the Japanese. The English has more fluid movement in fact then the Animation and feels like a cloud of smoke to the ears. At least for most of the things Yoko says. The other actors are pretty good for them going with Shizuka\u2019s monotone to the crazy way Watanuki\u2019s voice gets with some of the things he gets in to. Really I do feel sorry for the boy. The music is also really well done, giving it a really nice mystic feel to it and the opening is rather fun.\\n\\n\r\nThis show works a bit better in the manga because it explains so much more. \\n",

            "content": "Masterpiece, fucking masterpiece. Just beautiful. Let me tell you something, this is honestly the most unique series I have ever seen. Every part of this series is amazing in it's own way and I honestly won't understand how this animu is underrated. It makes me way too upset.\r\nSo the whole animu was based off Watanuki's life seeing spirits and how he meets Yuuko to grant his wish of getting rid of the spirits. I'm glad this animu didn't turn out to be one of those where something life changing happens at the beginning and the whole story is him living his new life. No, notat all. He spends the whole series up until Rou working for Yuuko and changing his life bit by bit throughout the story, and his progression and the story let alone was pure enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nI'm telling you, this animu will change some of your point of views in ways. I for one after finishing the whole series (Holic, Holic Kei, Holic Shunmuki, Holic Rou, TV series, excluding the movie which was the prequel to Holic) I learned a few such as how, basically a famous line thanks to animu, --\"There is no such thing as coincidence, there is only inevitable\" or \"It was destined to be\". Cliche, rite????? But either way, how it's used in the animu is completely outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nThere's always been complaints about how the characters are drawn and look like walking stick figures, honestly who the hell cares? Remember how in video games, the N64 is probably still one of the biggest consoles in history, hell not even speaking of the parent SNES, for the games? How the games had crappy 3D graphics compared to nowadays and even with that, people probably play N64 games more than the current consoles? It's because THERE'S A POINT IN THE STORYLINE, SOUND AND ENJOYMENT. I agree the animation stands out from the rest, but honestly isn't seeing something different good most of the time? Not only that, it's what made the animu even  more unique so it probably doesn't even matter. \\n\\n\r\nNow, here's another thing. The soundtrack for this is fascinating, Rou had my favorite soundtrack out of the TV/OVA series. Honestly, I'm sure some people can agree? I wasn't a fan of the Holic Kei OP/ED, aiming more towards the ED so I'm glad Rou was there in terms of the sound. I really did love the whole soundtrack of the anime however, most animus have similar tastes and relations in their music. Sort of like how Deadman Wonderland and Mirai Nikki share similar soundtrack and such. Holic's soundtrack is completely unique and amazing which was one of my favorable parts of the animu. I'm going to download the whole original soundtrack soon because it really is worth it. Huge 10/10 here.\\n\\n\r\nSo for the characters, despite the animu not having a lot of characters, the characters were also really nice and shared their own personalities. Watanuki being the protagonist shares comedic personalities, Yuuko shares the wise personalities, Himawari shares that happy/cute personality, Zashiki shares that really shy personality towards Watanuki for liking him, Ame shares the rude personality, Doumeki shares the brave personality and so forth. It's really nice seeing how all of the characters in this didn't share each others personalities but their own. Cheers for this, this isn't something you see a lot. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed watching the whole series. I learned a lot of things from this and my love for this grew so and so much throughout me watching. It is simply outstanding, unique and perfect. I wish to not change a single part of this.",

            "content": "This series is a delightful treat that places great emphasis on symbolism, perspective, traditions & rituals, and above all else: the notion to overcome any obstacle and to never regret your decisions.\r\nI'll admit that the animation often became irritating during specific scenes, what with the constant blundering on proper anatomy and overly limp noodle figurines. To say they became obscenely anorexic spaghetti shapes would be the understatement of the century. Though at times, it may have been tolerable.\r\nOverall, the color palette, lighting, and entirety of the show's mood was a treat that rightfully haunted over the less-than-exceptional animation style.\r\nDespite some characters having no real purpose(what we like to call \"comic relief\"), all of them often displayed an over-the-top and bright personality in their own unique ways; though the story is often dark and intellectual. It's a wonderful contrast of the two, which I believe made it all the more enjoyable. I never found the mood to have too much of anything in particular\u2014the balance between making you laugh and intriguing you with philosophies of all kinds was absolutely perfectly executed.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the outstanding parts of the series without a doubt is its music! This along with the actual dialogue of the show is where the show really shines effortlessly. The music captivated me into how I should feel at a moment's notice, and set the tone for the mood of not only the characters, but the story itself.\\n\\n\r\nDespite my harsh critique on its poor animation style as many others might agree, I overall loved watching this show. The ending feels a little rushed and cut-off too quickly, with that lingering feeling of wanting more. However, in spite of these transparent issues, this was an absolutely wonderful story filled with so many good qualities to pass up!\\n\r\nFor this reason, I give this show an 8/10! Because xxxHolic is here to prove that \"nothing in this world is a coincidence...\"",

            "content": "Now when I first saw this anime, in my mind i thought it might be a good anime because I've seen many mystery anime but guess what I was wrong and let me tell you why. Be sure to know that this is my personal opinion and if I say something that you don't agree that's fine. I don't think I'll spoil it but i might just a bit because i was getting pretty pissed throughout the episode. \r\nStory (7/10) : Okay so the story is alright but there were some episodes that didn't quite finish the story and was left not complete. Now Iknow this is a mystery anime, but some episodes were just left unfinished and i was quite piss because i wanted to know what exactly happen but it didn't show the next episode and went on to a different event or story whatever you want to called it. The story wasn't what i expected but it's quite nice and a bit funny to watch. So if you're looking for a good nice story. I suggest you watch this.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10): It's great nothing to be concern about unless you're not into this kind of art. I gave that score it was because the people in the background was kind of disturbing since it has no color on them. You know what i mean when you watch it.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10): Not important to even talk about this since i find nothing serious wrong with it but just one thing that I found and it's quite of surprised that they missed it when airing this anime. I wonder if you guys can find it too. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (5/10): Oh yeah this is what you're seeing five out of ten that's right the characters are horrible oh wait let me rephrase that again Watanuki , the main character, is horrible and i mean really horrible. Yes, he's a funny guy with a good heart but let's be serious okay because I'm pretty sure that I say something like I was pretty pissed throughout the episode, and he is what I would describe useless yes USELESS. He's the most useless MC (main character) I've ever seen and I mean really. I thought he would be a pretty good talker but no he's not what i thought he would be I mean yeah we wouldn't know until it seen it ourselves but let me tell you guys. If you're here to see a good know-how-to-solve character (Watanuki) I suggest you don't watch this. The other characters like Doumeki, Watanuki's \"love rival,\" is an okay character but nothing special about him, but I was kind of pissed at him too because he's the only person that always help Watanuki out which is like me watching a snake helping out a mouse. Himawari....that girl I didn't really pay much attention to her because i have no interest in her, but Yuuko is her who I really pay attention to. She's really mystery but it's what I like about her. There's more characters but they're not worth talking about. Don't be mistaken that I was talking about the style of the characters like they look skinny or whatever. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7/10): Now just because I say something bad on the characters doesn't mean I wouldn't enjoy it but there were few I didn't quite to be honest with you. It's good what people would say it's nice and kind of smooth to watch (kind of).\\n\\n\r\nOverall (6/10): It's fair. This first season was good and bad. The MC Watanuki is what I didn't enjoy watching him. I expected something good but no. He's what he is and I can't change anything from him and he doesn't change at all too. I would recommend this anime to people who is looking for a good story but if you're here for the characters or expect something from the Watanuki don't watch it. Let this be the final warning for you. I'll be watching the second season and see if there's something good would show but I highly doubt it. Anyway if you like this it's great but if you don't well that's too bad because you won't be liking it unless you don't care about Watanuki you're be fine.   \\n\\n",

            "content": "People not knowing anything about this show might see the name and wonder, 'Is this show a porno or something?' And the simple answer is no. Doesn't even come close which is a good thing. \r\nHolic is a supernatural anime that follows our main lead Watanuki with an interesting ability to see spirits. Very much to his annoyance as he just wants to live a normal, peaceful life. One day while trying to escape from a spirit, he stumbles across a shop run by an odd woman called Yuko who specializes in the granting of wishes. She forces him to work for her as aform of payment for helping him to deal with his ability and so begins his new life as a part time worker in a less than normal environment. \\n\\n\r\nThe story takes on a sort of episodic nature with some episodes dealing with various customers who stumble upon the shop while others deal with Watanuki dealing with various supernatural events so there isn't really a grand plot to the show. Despite this, it's very fun to watch and is quite comedic while some elements can get quite serious which I suppose makes it a sort of dark comedy. \\n\\n\r\nFor our main characters we have of course Watanuki. He is an all round decent guy who enjoys sports and cooking and is extremely self-sufficient since his parents died at a young age. Since he was young, he's been able to see spirits to his utter dismay as they tend to be a nuisance rather than life threatening and sometimes makes him look like an escaped mental patient to people who happen to see him when he is being 'attacked'. He works part time at Yukos shop as an errand boy. He cooks and cleans for Yuko and is often sent out to shop for food and alcohol which annoys him most of the time. Then we have Yuko who is completely shrouded in mystery as we know very little about her or her past. She is generally very lazy, getting Watanuki to do everything for her and enjoys drinking a lot, usually suffering from hangovers the next day despite Watanuki's warnings. She often states that there is no such thing as coincidence, only inevitability which she often states to customers who don't understand why they came to the shop. She has a laid back sort of attitude to her work as she appears to get rather annoyed when someone shows up. She gives advice and objects to help them probably knowing he/she won't listen hence leaving the outcome to fate. Next we have Doumeki who is a 'friend' to Watanuki. They are in the same year in school. He comes from a family of monks and posses a power to repel spirits as a contrast of Watanuki's attraction of them. For this reason, Yuko always insists Watanuki have him by his side much to Watanukis annoyance. He acts as a rational thinker and calm, quiet personna to Watanuki's more eccentric and loud personality. One can say they compliment each other but Watanuki refuses to acknowledge it. He tends to find Watanuki annoying at times but still sees him as his best friend and is always there to help him no matter the risk. And finally we have Himawari, a classmate of Watanuki and obvious love interest for Watanuki who goes into a sort of 'lovey dovey' mood around her only to be 'interrupted' by Doumeki. She is generally upbeat and high spirited and loves seeing Watanuki and Doumeki together as she finds their actions together funny.     \\n\\n\r\nThe show has a few recurring characters such as an elder Fox who runs a food stand, a rain spirit who doesn't have much time for Watanuki or any human really and a more nicer spirit who seems to exhibit feelings for Watanuki but is very shy. We also have Maru and Moro. Yuko's 2 assistants. They seem to be young girls who speak in unison together and tend to play around a lot. And of course we have Mokona, a black Firby like creature that lives with Yuko. He often accompanies Watanuki on some jobs, usually just to boss him around and is Yuko's drinking buddy. \\n\\n\r\nOverall the shows characters are pretty well rounded and fun to watch. Watanuki's rage moments can get annoying at times but most are still quite funny so don't let it discourage. \\n\\n\r\nThe show was made by Production I.G with the source material being a manga of the same name by CLAMP. The animation of the show is decent with it's best being during serious moments. However it can be quite inconsistent at times, especially when making legs and arms 10 feet long at times which isn't too much of an issue but still noticeable. The Japanese audio is pretty good with Jun Fukuyama as Watanuki who gives a great performance. The English audio is top notch to with Todd Haberkorn as Watanuki. One of my favourite Haberkorn performances. We also have Collen Clinkenbeard as Yuko and she gives a very performance, really nailing the mysterious nature of her character. J. Michael Tatum gives a nice performance of Doumeki. I believe he really nails silent nature of Doumeki very well. I believe Haberkorn and Tatum displayed great chemistry between their respective characters very well. Cherami Leigh gives a lovely performance as Himawari also. She highlights her outgoing personality well I think. I'd recommend to watch the show in English but if you're a sub person, the Japanese audio is perfectly fine to. \\n\\n\r\nI'd recommend this show as a buy personally. For folks, like myself, who live in the UK, you should be able to pick up the show pretty cheap from Manga UK. Funimation has the show licensed in the US and Madman has the show licensed in Australia. However the 2nd season remains unlicensed unfortunately. I hope it's gets picked up at some point.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading. Hope it was beneficial.",

            "content": "xxxHolic (pronounced \"holic\") is an anime adaptation of a CLAMP manga of the same name. The anime was made as a 24-episode advertisement for the manga. There's no real overarching plot or even an end. The show expects you to read the manga if you want any kind of closure. This series is exactly what you'd expect from CLAMP. It's in each episode the main characters solve a person's problem, making the person happy by the end of the episode. If you've read anything by CLAMP you'll know what to expect. On top of that, the character designs for xxxHolic are downright ugly! Every characterlooks like some kind of demented Ent-frog with their tall, skinny bodies and long limbs. As much as I'm hating on it, it's not a terrible show. It's a lot like CLAMP's other non-Cardcaptor shows, remarkably average. So, if you've read the manga and want to see the exact same thing animated, then it might be worth checking out. But if you're not already in love with CLAMP, then you might want to skip this one.",

            "content": "xxxHolic is a 26-episode anime series produced by TBS and Production I.G. and is based on the CLAMP manga of the same name. It's a highly exciting and delightful anime, and will offer the viewer a different side of the CLAMP franchise. \r\n  The art of the anime is superlative. It takes time to get adjusted to the slightly unconventional art, but one soon gets used to it. Additionally, every character except the lead characters is not clearly drawn; rather, you get gray silhouettes which serve to further accentuate the lead characters&rsquo; behavior. \r\n  The lead characters themselves are very-well conceivedof. Their physical structure embodies their traits, and gives us a sense of something slightly off from the real world.\\n\r\n  That said the story is eerily un-CLAMP-like. There are not many happy endings, just enough to get the reader hooked. Most times, the evildoer gets a punishment for what he has done, in a way that serves to hold his crime up to the moral judgment of the viewer. But the damage is not restricted; sometimes, even the person who is nearby or a family member also gets mixed up. The story at times seems so real-life that one has to literally shake his illusions away. Several philosophical issues are treated with such deftness that even the hardiest Sophist would be hard put to deny their efficacy on the viewer&rsquo;s mind.  \\n\r\n  The character conceptualization is a work of pure finesse, characteristic of I.G. works. Watanuki is a deep study in psychology, Yuuko Ichihara is one of the charismatic philosophers ever seen in anime, and both Domeki and Himawari depict two sides of the human animal: the strong, disbelieving side, and the believer inside every one of us. Maru and Moro, as well as the irritably cute Mokona, serve to lighten the viewer&rsquo;s concentration with a dash of well-placed humor. Additional characters, such as the incredibly likable Vestal, and the hoity-toity Rain Sprite, also attract the viewer&rsquo;s affection or irritation: an altogether natural reaction that all anime hopes for.\\n\r\n  The music for the show is great. The OP, Suga Shikao&rsquo;s 19sai, is a foot-tapping number (and my flagship song, hee hee). Its tight vocals and awesome accompaniments will make it an effortless climber on your playlist for sure. The EDs are similarly awesome; the first one, Reason by Fonogenico, will bring out the goofy side of you, while the second ED, Kagerou by BUCK-TICK, is a great listen, well-assisted by the credit scene, where we see Maru and Moro playing air guitar. \\n\r\n  So, in conclusion, who do I recommend to? All the seriously concerned folks out there, for starters. Here many sensitive and basic ethical problems are treated with a delicacy and sophistry that&rsquo;ll probably satisfy all your dreams of being philosophers. Secondly, all you guys who like the fables and myths of Japan should check it out; these abound in the anime. Thirdly, I&rsquo;d recommend this anime to all those who enjoyed Ghost in the Shell and its beautiful leading lady; I assure you, Yuuko Ichihara is eminently suitable for your appreciation as well. \\n\r\n  But that&rsquo;s of course just a suggestion. All are welcome to see this funny yet serious, hysterical yet humbling view of men and their conception of their true worth in the world.  \\n",

As an artist I both laugh at, and with, the design. I think the consistency and unique style made me appreciate it. Is it ugly? Sometimes, but I think the overall style is very cool - especially with the monsters and story elements. \r\nI found that it doesn't flow together like a traditional story. It's more episodic, which makes me look forward to each new tale. \r\nI'm not a huge fan of Watanuki. He's loud, clumsy,slow, and his personality is all over the place but he has his funny moments. Himawari is okay, there's just not much to her. But the other characters are worth it, I do enjoy watching Yuuko boss Watanuki around.\\n\r\nI don't like the ending all that much. It seemed out of nowhere, and for some reason I always forget what actually happened in the last episode.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I really like this show. I agree it's not amazing, but it's a nice little ride. When I'm not in the mood for a psychological anime, an amazing love story, or an intense thriller, I find myself relaxing to this one.",

The English voice actors are very well chosen and Todd Haberkorn was a very good choice for Watanuki. Colleen Clinkenbeard as Yuuko is also a very good choice as she fits the character very well.\r\nThe music choice is very good the opening andclosing songs are very good and suite the show well. Also the show is full of interesting little words of wisdom like little fortune cookie moments.\\n\\n\r\nA truly great show anyone should love this show.",

As in right now!!\r\nMy gosh!!! How could I almost miss this one??? I bought this with D. Gray Man, and I planned to watch the shounen first, thinking that Holic might suck and I would be \r\njinxed by it. Oh yes, I had that thought. How horrible...but, MUKYAAA~~~I was left in AWE!!.\r\nI don't have high expectations with this one. Clamp's works remind me of Card Captor and Magic Knight Rayearth, both I enjoyed whenI was in grade school, but watching them today doesn't make me a fan anymore. That's why I have doubts,, and doubts, and doubts, until....I heard the OPening...\\n\\n\\n\r\nWushu!! it keeps on singing in my head until now,,for real..It definitely grew in me...How could you not like this? this song simply makes you for a good mood...and is so so so so appropriate for the anime it self...Yosh!\\n\\n\r\nI never thought that I would love all the CHARACTERS in this one. Yuuko-san is the most LOVABLE Witch, as described in the DVD cover, I have ever known. it's okay that she isn't given much of a development compared to other leads because her general presence makes her femininity stand out the best!! I love her, she's like a bigger sister..Tee-hee ^__^\\n\\n\r\nWatanuki is the most vulnerable male character I've ever met...hehehe, as if...He is so handsome when he is serious..I remember the first episode where he is walking in the street so seriously then suddenly started to run so fast as if someone is chasing him, later on revealed that he is being annoyed by the spirits which made him roll in the road for real...hehehe..so cute attention-getter for a start...He is voiced by my second favorite dubber, Jun Fukuyama,so great of him...\\n\\n\r\nIs the relationship between Doumeki and Watanuki considered as Shounen Ai? Can it be called simply as Friendship? Why people have to label simple gestures as it is??? Sigh~~~ Whatever...\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, the animation doesn't seem realistic..I mean how the characters are drawn, they don't seem like real people..But I think the artwork is great,,Well, I'm not really good with this technical stuff...hek hekkk.,,\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is a SUUUUPPPERRR recommended Anime. I have my best times, my average moments and my love-to-watch-it-at-night-but-is-so-scary-i-always-look-at-my-back syndrome...heheheheh\\n\\n\\n\r\nFrom me,\\n\r\nYour Love BUG",

            "content": "xxxHolic is a another awesome work of CLAMP and is a crossover to Tsubasa. It has a good english and japanese dub ( especially with Yuuko :3) and also its supernatural-like artwork. We've seen Yuuko in Tsubasa's OVAs and episodes, but there's more to her and Watanuki's ,the main charater,story. It all began with Kimihiro Watakuni, a boy who saw spirits all his life and came into a magical shop and met the one and only, Yuuko Ichihara. She said the reason that he came to the shop was that he had a wish to not  see spirits anymore. So she made a dealwith him that she would grant his wish, but he had to pay for it so he decided to work at her shop. But there's always an adventure once he started to work with her at good times and bad times. There is also a girl that Watanuki likes named Himawari and a boy that Watanuki dislikes but has exroist's powers named Domeki in the series and are half main charaters, but of course we can't forget the little Mokona and Yuuko's assintists Maru and Moro. Ever since I read the first chapter of the manga, I fell in love with it and decided to watch the anime. Lucky its dubbed by Funmation so I gotta say the english dub is good (also the japanese is awesome too). It has one ,i think, filier episode but its really good and the soundtrack is pretty good too. So all I have to say is the show is good,but for some people it can get boring sometimes. There is a second series out, but it hasn't been realsed to America yet and there's no episodes of it on Youtube ( there is also changes in there like Kohane's story). So to all of the CLAMP fans and people who like supernatural, fatansy and mystery animes, then xxxHolic is the one for you!",

            "content": "Xxxholic is a anime of whimsical spells, charm, and other worldly things that gives the lesson of \"what comes around goes around\" the story came pounding in 2003 and has taken over into a movie,2 anime series and several magazines dedicated to this story. I like how abstract everything is the animation is very different when it comes to people. For one thing everyone looks like they are 8 feet tall. But also the animation goes perfectly with the idea of supernatural with faded colors , swirls and the traditional Japanese painting style\r\n The story starts with a high school guy called Watanuki ( meansApril 1st) he constantly deals with pesky spirits and absolutely hates life. He somehow is drawn into a shop where a woman ( who sorta reminds me of the caterpillar in Alice in Wonderland) named Yuko grants wishes. He doesn't believe her and walks away ,to see that his wish came true. But with every gift Yuko gives there is a price. He starts working for her and being her funny slave as she orders him to make way too much food. He has to deal with this while he struggles with his secret crush for a classmate named Himawari. Yuko starts getting them together and the bunch actually starts becoming close. Even though Watanuki has to deal with the annoyance of Yuko , her adorable rabbit thing and Domeki ( a guy he has to work with who can hear spirits and watanuki is very jealous of him.)\\n\\n\r\nYou need to get this whole series it really makes you think of how things you do can affect others or yourself without you knowing it like being addicted to something, cheating on your boyfriends , or lying . But also the characters really funny and charming.And the soundtrack is hypnotizing with deep beats and a scratchy voice.  (Besides Himawari she sorta annoyed me ! )I want him with Yuko!!! but idk who it ends because I haven't seen the movie . You won't be disappointed in this ! I got into this after my dear old wise friend Graham recommended it to me. ^^ ps it is pronounced as holic with silent Xxx lol it's confusing :P\\n\\n\r\n XxxHolic A Midnight Summers dream - movie\\n\\n\r\nxxxholic - anime and manga READ AND WATCH IT! you can also get several fanbooks  from this but idk how they are because I haven't seen them before.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a great series that will grip your heart strings and make you think what you do .. * turning head suspiciously * because you never know when karma will come around and get you XD",

            "content": "It's a must watch anime. Subtle storyline with not many twists and turns, acceptable behaviour of the characters with the hint of supernatural, that's something unusual in today's animes. This anime proves that a good logical and sensible anime doesn't have to be full with hell lots of characters or technical terms but just connection to the real world and time fills all the requirements. The first time I saw this anime, I was actually feeling bored since I didn't like the characters but within few moments, I got obsessed with the \"ghostly experience\".\r\n* Story: 1010\r\nI've no complain or demand with the story or whatsoever.It fulfilled everything I need to stick to the TV for 24 mins. Watanuki, a high schooler with the ability to see supernatural stuffs. In many animes it is shown that the characters express their feelings in an extraordinary manner than their usual demeanor. For example Bleach, where the hero Ichigo is not ready to help normal people yet have sympathetic side for ghosts. I liked the behaviour of Watanuki that instead of being scared or happy to be surrounded by those creatures, he called them \"bugs\" which stick to him everywhere he goes. Then came Yuuko. I got stuck to the anime because of her. Extremely sensitive dialogues yet delivered in such simplicity. No doubt, her quotes over life are moving. \"For everything you get, you must pay an equal price to balance the rules of nature\" I made this quote the principle of my life. Psychological animes are always a masterpiece and this one is no less. The last four episodes were rather moving, I must say. But the ending of episode 10 was rather intriguing.\\n\\n\r\n* Characters and Animation: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nI have no problem with the character profile rather the animation. I don't think it would have been a problem to create perfect characters. Yet they were all having elongated hands and legs. This somehow suited Watanuki though. The way he walked in sigh nad angry made it look more funny. Character development was perfect. Nothing more nothing less for the season. It went on slow and steady so that people who miss some episodes might catch up. Yuuko Ichihara, the witch, her dialogues were spot-on for the situation. I liked the fact that there weren't any friends of Watanuki otherwise the character development could have been a mess. Shizuka Domeiki, the next character, he was good. Just little so much serious in my eyes, good thing that he smiled in the second last episode.\\n\\n\r\n* Music and Soundtracks: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe background play was smooth. It wasn't fighting for spotlight. It fitted the show's theme perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening 19sai by Suga Shikao was very catchy. I got it in my playlist right after I heard it. The first ending Reason by Fotogenico was good. The second ending was not my type and hence wasn't good.\\n\\n\r\n* Reason to Watch/Enjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nA great mixture of spook plus psychology! I can't wait to watch the further seasons! This story can hold you up as long as you like mystery. I will say if you want something else other than the mainline animes with lots of action and gory scenes then this is the place for you to visit. It will not only entertain you but also help you with some great quotes over human's life.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI would highly suggest people watching it because it is worth spending your time on TV or net. There are small defects in it but hey, every good thing has to have something bad or there is saying like that ^_^ Anyways, if you haven't seen the anime then surely visit it once.",

Watanuki is a orphaned high schooler who can see spirits, which to him is more of a burden that gift. He feels out of place and is socially akward sometimes so he doesnt have many friends but is very kind, responsible, and hardworking. One day  he is drawn into a shop where the owner's service available is granting wishes. His life changes dramatically from that day. Overall this anime is one of my favorites. I love the original storyline and artwork and i find that all the characters are verycreative and have not found any other like them. There is a good mixture of comedy and supernatural in the plotline as well as several plot twists and leaves the watcher very entertained throughout the story. I recommend this anime highly for it originality and well developed plot line and characters.",

            "content": "xxxHolic is about Watanuki who, unlike most people, all his life has been able to see supernatural spirits. Unfortunately this means when he is attacked by a spirit in public he looks like a lunatic.\r\nOne day he stumbles across a strange shop owned by the equally mysterious Yuuko who has the ability to grant any wish for a price which means you won't always be expected to pay with money. In exchange for taking away Watanuki's ability to see spirits Watanuki has to work part-time at the shop as er Yuuko's dogs body. However, by working at the shop Watanuki learns about the spirit worldand there is sometimes a reason behind Yuuko's often unreasonable demands.\\n\\n\r\nI have to say it took me a while to get used to xxxHolic with the long character designs and Watanuki's one way arguments with Domeki and his fawning over Himawari. However, I slowly got used to it and honestly began to enjoy Watanuki's adventures in the spirit world and the interesting and sometimes troubled characters he meets not to mention.\\n\\n\r\nThe series is episodic with a different story each episode which are mostly well written with interesting plots.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the design of the characters the animation was good without being spectacular although I don't think it really needed to be and the music was good.\\n\\n\r\nWhat xxxHolic excelled in the most was the characters. It was one of the few anime's I've seen which I saw with the English dub. Happily they used some of the best English voice actors and properly translated the Japanese script, which I don't think is always the case, so they don't look like they are reading the English subtitles in the subbed version.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed Yuuko and Domeki's deadpan laidback persona. When Watanuki was not complaining at Domeki or fawning over Himawari he was a likable main character. I also like the spirits Zashiki-warashi and Ame-warashi as well as the characters we see in only one episode.\\n\\n\r\nIf there is one thing I really bugged me that was Mokena. Whatever it was it wasn't funny and added nothing to the series and I think wouldn't be missed.",

This makes it easy to re-watch favorite episodes.  \r\nMost of the events seemed a bit...how do I say...childish?  A lot of the time it felt like a morality show for children, with each episode teaching a particular lesson (do not lie, do not kill, benice to strangers, etc.).  \\n\\n\r\nThere was also plenty of comedy to keep things entertaining.",

            "content": "In the grand scheme of things I can't recommend this show. While I'm a big fan of different and outside the box anime, this felt lacking. It avoid all the cliches that one tires of in anime, but that's not enough. Noteworthy for not being note worthy. It mixes the genres of supernatural, comedy slice of life and romance, but doesn't excel at any of them. Also, it's not very exciting, and down right boring at times. It's at it's best when Yuko is granting wishes. But all in all it doesn't gain or build any steam. You'd think Watanuki would grow, learn, overcome and/oradapt but no (this becomes a problem considering how the last three episodes play out). So every character is reduced to one note that is repeated every episode. The very definition of lack of character development. While refreshing to see an anime stick with the same opening theme for 24 episodes, the two ending themes don't really fit the tone of the series. The gigantic bodies (or is it tiny heads?) that is the CLAMP signature is bothersome, but not annoying. It's distracting but not a distraction. It's worth pointing out because of a similar critique for Code Geass.\\n\r\nUltimately the principal thing I dislike here is Watanuki himself. He comes across as a terrible person. He constantly complains about his servitude and Yuko & Mokona's behavior, but masochistically complies. I get it he might face dire consequences for just quitting and walking out on Yuko, but we never catch a glimpse of that. His adoration of Himawari makes him a borderline stalker, flying into a rage whenever he talks to another male. And of course he can never simply just express his feelings for her without distraction or misunderstanding. Thus leaving the love unrequited, something I've grown to hate in anime. Then there's his baseless jealousy and envy of Doumeki. I understand Watanuki is suppose to portray an average high school boy with average high school boy insecurities; but Doumeki doesn't do anything to warrant Watanuki's outbursts. \\n\r\nMaybe had I watched it when it was new (and I was ten years younger) I would have enjoyed it more. But c'est la vie, I watched it, it's over and I'm looking ahead to the next series.",

It can be really cheerful and funny too. I do fine their first opening and ending quite catchy. \r\nI really love their character development. Itmakes me so attach to them. When I finish watching, I just miss their presence. I do long for more episode. Sadly, there will be no more. It is like a roller coaster-up and down.

So let\u2019s rock!\r\nStory: \u201cCopied from xxxHOLiC Wiki\u201d\r\nKimihiro Watanuki is a high school student plagued by y\u014dkai and ayakashi spirits, both of which are invisible to everyone else but him. The series begins when Watanuki stumbles, seemingly by chance, into a shop that grants wishes. The shop is owned by Y\u016bko Ichihara, a mysterious witch of many names and esoteric renown. For a price, she offers to grant Watanuki's wish to be rid of the spirits. The price, according to Y\u016bko,must be of equal value; so, as payment, he must become Y\u016bko's temporary, part-time cook and housekeeper. While his established job consists of household chores, Y\u016bko increasingly sends him on errands of a supernatural or spiritual nature as the series develops. Himawari Kunogi, Watanuki's love interest, and Shizuka D\u014dmeki, a classmate whom Watanuki initially detests, occasionally join him in his work as per Y\u016bko's request. The three become increasingly close, and though Watanuki is often annoyed with D\u014dmeki, he grows to value the new friendships he makes and his life at the wish shop.\\n\\n\r\nMy comment: So that is the gist of the first season, which is 23 episodes long [with a flash back-like extra] making it 24 episodes. There is also a movie, a live-action series, and a second season xxxHOLiC: Kei. The series is also a CLAMP series [I love CLAMP] which means it does intertwine with the Tsubasa Chronicles [which I have just started watching myself]. CLAMP is known for bringing us many anime/manga like Chobits, and a collaboration work that produced Code Geass. I will just be reviewing the first season\u2026since I\u2019m in the middle of the second season and just started the Tsubasa Chronicles, bear with me xD.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: So there are about four characters that really stand out and that we get to see most often, and four that hold some importance to the series itself. Personally I liked the uniqueness of all the characters. I especially loved Mokona o_o\u2026loved. An adorable chubby stuffed animal looking bunny, with some supernatural abilities; Mokona\u2019s mouth was like a vacuum of sorts, sucking up evil auras, and such. Mokona also had the ability to see youkai, ayakashi spirits, and the dead. Not to mention Mokona is a heavy drinker like Yuuko. [More Sake! Pleeaaasee!]. Speaking of Yuuko, she is the owner of the wish shop. She holds some intense powers and is knowledgeable and all-seeing. She grants wishes by taking something of the collateral, but she\u2019s also a heavy drinker [more like xxxALCOHOLiC] and an overbearing employer to our humble main character Watanuki. Now I can\u2019t say I disliked Watanuki, he could cook, he could clean, he could see things we only dreamed of; and yet his character design flaw was his lack of concern for himself. He always thought of others before himself, well others\u2026except for Doumeki. Kidding! He cared for Doumeki, somewhere deep inside. Doumeki was almost like a \u2018love rival\u2019 in his eyes although he was born as a natural spirit repeller. [Err\u2026like insect repellent but\u2026a human\u2026]. Yuuko constantly pairs Doumeki and Watanuki together because as long as Doumeki is around, spirits won\u2019t attack Watanuki. He\u2019s athletic [Arching], and very nonchalant I could honestly say he was my favorite human character. Well, earlier I mentioned \u2018love-rival\u2019; enter Himawari-chaaaan. Watanuki\u2019s love interest [he\u2019s literally obsessed], but as Yuuko said herself, and I quote: \u201cI don\u2019t think she is your destined one\u201d. Himawari is not the most annoying female character; she\u2019s often helping Watanuki, hanging out with both him and Doumeki. She likes creepy things, and honestly gives off a vibe sometimes\u2026something\u2019s not right with her\u2026I swear. Alright, now the secondary characters! Maru & Moro adorable as they are, they are soulless assistants that work in the shop. They speak in rhymes and patterns and are just, adorable. Yet, they cannot leave the shop because they lack real souls. Next, Zashiki-warashi, she\u2019s a spirit girl, she\u2019s adorable and shy, but has a crush on Watanuki. She cries often and has these karasutengu guarding her and they attack Watanuki whenever she cries\u2026even if they are happy-happy tears\u2026[poor guy]. Lastly there is Ame-warashi who is a rain spirit, and does not have the best opinion of humans. She\u2019s like a big sister to Zashiki-warashi and cares for her well-being. There are maaannny other characters I don\u2019t think hold that much significance in the first season so I shall not speak of them. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound: You must be thinking. What lanky long bodies they have. That\u2019s CLAMP\u2019s style and at first, that\u2019s what I thought too. It\u2019s a part of the reason why I wasn\u2019t too appealed to several CLAMP series [at first]\u2026except Chobits. God, I loved Chobits. Although the art style may not look too appealing, Production I.G Studio does a good job with keeping the art style of the original. I love that, and it grows on you. They make their lanky people look gooood. If you\u2019re not familiar with Suga Shikao. Search him, now. 19sai the opening song for xxxHOLiC fit perfectly. It kept the dark theme and mysteriousness of the series so real I loved it! Although I haven\u2019t looked too much into their OSTs their soundtrack is nothing to laugh at, really. It\u2019s amazing how nicely the show and the sound just fit together. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: \u2018Twas an awesome and beautiful series that got me hooked on it, and made me really look at CLAMP in a whole new light. Blew my mind, and almost every expectation I had for it. Would I recommend it? Most definitely, but if you\u2019re not into mysterious, somewhat spine chilling things that make you take a second look at life. This probably isn\u2019t the show for you, and that\u2019s okey because I believe there is an anime out there for everyone no matter how different your tastes may be. This anime resonated with me. I give it an 8.5/10!\\n\\n\r\nThis is Cyn signing off! I hope to do more of these, so let\u2019s hope we get to rock again, be ready to bear with me xD.\\n",

            "content": "This anime is the stereotypical mc helps other people out scenario kinda like Gintama except they get compensation for it. \r\nStory- There isn't really a main plot but the individual ones plus creep factor were pretty good. \r\nArt- I've watched so many anime I'm really picky with art style. I understand this is 2006 but still every time I saw them it annoyed me to no end. Their limbs are so long when they stand up they're equivalent to half of a 5 story building. The way the moved really irritated me too. Sometimes Watanuki would fall and his movements were so exaggerated he lookedlike a giant spider.\\n\\n\r\nSound- There are definitely some nice sound tracks especially when they have fuzzy and warm moments. The seiyuu's are good too. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter- The mc Watanuki was kinda obnoxious fawning over Himawari every single freaking time he saw her. They went so classic with the straight man character, the silent popular guy, and the high pitched nice girl. There is a little character development. You see the mcs get closer even though Watanuki is still in denial. Yuko was a good mc too. I loved her childish and selfish personality towards Watanuki even though constantly watching him do work was annoying. \\n\\n\r\nOverall- It was ok. The art was a huge minus but that's only because I'm so used to good art from modern anime. They really pushed the humor but it wasn't really that funny. Again all of this is probably the 2006 factor. The character designs weren't really that original, but the story was decent. They did a really good job with creep factor. If you can bear through all 24 episodes of 2006 art and repeats of kinda bad jokes you'll probably like it. \\n\r\nThat's all thanks for reading. ^~^",

But do you think that horror animes are usually gore? xxxHolic doesn't have gore but still you will like this anime. This anime I loved \r\nArt:\r\nThis anime had some of the most unique style of artwork. But it actually fits the scenery to this anime knowing that it has to do with spirits. But the one thing I find the most unique in the character art is that all the human characters have long slender bodies. When I say that thoughI mean long legs and arms.\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe opening theme was not the best song through out the series in my opinion all though it really is a good opening. The first ending song was a little bit catchy but just wasn't the best in the show. The second ending was the best in the show and probably one of the greatest endings in my opinion. The soundtrack through out the series was very fitting for it though.\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nI will just say that the characters had their good points not so much bad points though. First Yuko the woman who runs the shop who has a lot of knowledge about everything at the shop and loves alcohol. Than Watanuki  the person who sees spirits and mostly makes up the whole story. Mokona my favorite character but I cant say much about mokona except Mokona is mokona. Domoki the one person for some reason watanuki cant stand at all. himawari who is Watanuki's crush. and finally maru and moro who are Yuko's servents.\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI enjoyed this show a lot I just loved the story line of this anime and just everything.",

            "content": "xxxHolic is the first anime that I had watched in a while. I wanted to get back into the Anime, and a friend suggested this one as one that was more obscure of sorts. It was a very good one to start with in my opinion. \r\nStory: It's more of a psychological story than I was used too. Every episode made me think about what was going on in my own life and I was easily able to relate. It deals with morality, the actions that people make, and how everyone must make their own choices. In the 24 episodes, the story is very wellplayed out. However, there are other series after xxxHolic that should be looked into if one wants to see the rest of the story played out. \\n\\n\r\nArt: It is a very different style than I'm used too. The art focuses on the main characters and the scenery, and those who aren't as important do not have as much detail. I like the contrast between the two. I'm not sure what to think of how people are portrayed in this series however. I have mixed feelings about how overly exaggerated the limbs on all the characters are. It is nothing to look down on though, the art is still very well done. \\n\\n\r\nSound: There isn't much in the sense of different music in the series overall. The opening music though is quite catchy. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters are very well fleshed out. Not every character is seen in depth, but there is a good mix of those who are looked deep into and those who are covered, but not in an extreme amount of detail. The characters do have different relationships with one another, and the links are easy to follow. The cast is set up in a way that everyone can have a different favorite (in comparison to some who the majority of the people will be behind one specific character, normally the protagonist). \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This is a very enjoyable anime. It's easy to follow, good character development, and each episode brings a message that people can take from it (minus a couple of episodes that seem to focus solely on entertainment, but there's no problem with that). Definitely a series that worth watching, be it once or a few times. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: Linear and straightforward story, good cast of characters, and it makes you think. I believe teens and young adults (say, late high school through college) kids may get the most out of it, being able to relate to the characters more.",
