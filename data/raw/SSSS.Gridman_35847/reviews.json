            "content": "After 25 years since the original Gridman TV series debuted in 1993, Studio Trigger and Tsuburaya Productions, the company behind Gridman and Ultraman, have collaborated to produce the magnificent tokusatsu inspired reboot SSSS.Gridman. For those who are new to Gridman and tokusatsu entertainment, it is the Japanese term attached to any sci-fi/fantasy live-action series that uses an abundance of special effects. More specifically, practical effects; think people wrestling in rubber monster suits smashing through model cities and stop motion animation.\r\nThat leads us to SSSS.Gridman, the love child of first-time director Akira Amemiya and Keiichi Hasegawa, famed screenwriter of the 1990s Ultraman. It is overflowing withreferences and callbacks to the live-action series, SSSS is a lovingly crafted modernized take on the original series. The new story takes a theme relevant to today\u2019s audiences and focuses on the youth of Japan and their relationship to technology. \\n\\n\r\nThe show opens on Yuta Hibiki, an amnesiac first-year in high school who\u2019s just woken up in the home of Rikka Takarada, a girl in his class. With no clue who she is, or who he is for that matter. His standard introduction no doubt had people rolling their eyes, including me, and it does detract from the story, at least until we learn why he lost his memory. Yuta sees hallucinations of a robot named Gridman in an old computer in Takarada's family store, later called \u2018Junk\u2019 in reference to its name in the original show. Afterward, he meets Sho Utsumi, his friend before getting amnesia. Sho helps him with his memory loss, which is more or less his role in the series, being Yuta's support. He's a decent character, with a minor arc and some development. Throughout the first episode, the information we\u2019re being fed by the characters is incongruous with what we observe from Yuta\u2019s perspective. Rikka and Utsumi easily accept Yuta\u2019s amnesia and when he sees Kaiju looming in the distance they assume he\u2019s joking because\u2014like his Gridman hallucinations\u2014he is the only one who can see them at first. In spite of the mundane reactions of people around Yuta, the directing of nearly every scene communicates dread. It constantly feels like danger is just off the frame and the next scene will change everything.\\n\\n\r\nAmemiya lingers on long shots too long for them to feel normal, instead, they communicate anxiety, you constantly are waiting for something to happen that will break the mundanity. Lighting is oversaturated during the daytimes to convey the crushing heat of the summer, and at night is subdued with fog and the monsters are constantly shown looming in the distance over the heroes. In the first episode, a radio playing is placed in between scenes to shift the tone. It bears so much similarity to Neon Genesis Evangelion, it's unsurprising the director is a Gainax veteran. No doubt, SSSS.Gridman's greatest strength is the tone, it balances the mundane life of high school students with the dread of a Kaiju attack. Eventually, when the Kaiju do attack, it is equally satisfying to watch play out. The three main characters are together in Rikka\u2019s family store when the first Kaiju begins wreaking havoc on the city, forcing Yuta to work with Gridman fight off the monsters in giant robot form. Together they create the Gridman Alliance, dedicated to defeating any Kaiju that threatens their city.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation is fluid, characters are incredibly expressive, storyboards are filled with detail, shots are excellently framed. The camera work is dynamic making the action always exciting and even the CGI used during many of the fight scenes is superb. The sound design is especially amazing at giving audio feedback during these scenes, a vehicle being crushed, the ground crumbling under a monster, and all of the attacks sound so visceral and lifelike. From time to time the show's incredible opening is used as background music in fights, and this would typically grow tiresome but because the song is so good and relevant to the story it never bothered me. At times the monster's movements look janky, but it never feels unintentional, watching old tokusatsu series shows that this is how the monster/giant robot fights looked, they move in ways that make it seem as though someone is inside a suit navigating them. 2D animation could never have achieved the authenticity of the monsters they were aiming for here. Not every scene is exploding with action, but even when the pace slows down, the directing and intruiging storyboarding are still visually arresting. One qualm I would bring up is the overabundance of fanservice placed at awkward moments, this thankfully only happened in certain episodes around the midpoint of the show. All around, this show is incredibly faithful to the original series, visually, audibly, and narratively.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is at times too standard to the genre and could have used more originality rather than reliance on the source material. It delivers it's story beats confidently and plenty self-aware of the nostalgia it's evoking, but the times it updates the script to a modern audience are worthwhile. Important information is shown to us rather than told, a characters motivation is never told to us before it is shown, a twist never comes that wasn\u2019t foreshadowed heavily. This showing rather than telling comes across the most in Akane Shinjou's scenes, a classmate of Yuta\u2019s. She offers the most exciting writing in the show. In the first episode alone, her scenes convey more fear than any of the Kaiju scenes. She\u2019s subtle with her dark side and when she gets her quiet moments of angry reflection you get to see how bitter she is. Her psychotic tendencies and lack of care for others are made all the more frightening by how much power she proves to have.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough Yuta's simplistic personality is explained very well in the narrative, Rikka and Akane get far more development than him. Eventually, they even take his place as the protagonists, and the show is much better for it. Rikka gets more development than Yuta and becomes a remarkably sympathetic character right away. While Yuta and Utsumi celebrate their victories against Kaiju she worries about the fallout of the city being attacked and if her friends are safe. She's the most nuanced character in the show, and it often feels like she is a normal person who was placed into the plot of a wild sci-fi kids show. Her apprehension towards conflict and her contemplation of the effects of what's occurring in the story are what makes her so believable. Yuta and Utsumi are at first, ecstatic to escape the mundane life of being a student, then the shock of the danger they\u2019re in forces them to face reality and change their mindsets. Whereas Yuta accepts he has to overcome challenges at face value and follows through like a typical protagonist, Rikka is constantly questioning why she\u2019s in such a dire situation and where her place is in all of it. Her development throughout the show is intertwined with Akane's and they both change in ways that are very engaging to watch play out. \\n\\n\r\nThe themes of Gridman are showcased throughout the story in the elaborate technology the villain has, all alone in her room, contrasted with the beat-up old computer the Gridman Alliance use. Yet even with basic technology, they prove to be formidable foes to the Kaiju, and they enjoy working together. What the screenwriter is trying to say is rather basic, but it\u2019s nonetheless a well-reinforced theme and consistent throughout the show, you don\u2019t need an abundance of technology to have good relationships and valued friendships. \\n\\n\r\n[Final Score: 8/10]\\n\r\nSSSS.Gridman stands as one of the best mecha in recent memory. Stylistically it is much different than the rest of Studio Trigger's anime, but it is one of their greatest works yet. It wears its love for the original series and tokusatsu entertainment on its sleeve. The story is wonderfully nostalgic, and surprisingly enough, thought-provoking. Laden with subtle details building up to every twist, every theme, it is both visually interesting and endlessly analyzable. I look forward to rewatching it time and time again in the future.",

            "content": "This show is so under-rated. I don't know how it's rating is so low on MyAnimeList. Big shotout to PhenomSage for recommending.\r\nIt proves that you really can't judge a book by its cover, or review on MAL.\r\nSo to start off, a lot of you will probably look at this anime and think: \"Ew, its UltraMan animated\". This is for kids... Next. \r\nBut not so fast, while this anime does borrow a lot of inspiration from UltraMan, it is in a differnt league. The story is very fresh and creative, with it's own spin on the UltraMan genre that is obviously intented for a more matureaudience. The closest anime I can think of is Madoka Magica and its adoptation of the SaliorMoon genre. \\n\\n\r\nThe story started off awesomely and is getting more and more interesting every episode. You just need to watch it without any prejudice. Yes, it's about a boy who transforms into an UltraMan-like hero and fights monsters, but this is only a cover-up for a deeper underlying story. There's is clearly some dark mystery going on in the background, but the story doesn't draw more attention to it than it needs to. \\n\\n\r\nI need to applaud the storytelling so far, it's so on-point with its humour, pace, and suspense. The characters are also very interesting and beautifully created. They are super relatable and realistic. They are never oblivious to their situation and stalls out the story. Instead, they are the key driving force of the plot. The whole \"battling monsters\" acts as more of a background entertainment, which can be pretty nostalgic for those of us growing up watching UltraMan. The art is amazing! Top-tier along side animes like Code Geass and Macross Frontier. Music is awesome too! You can tell the creators are putting a lot of thought and efforts into this. \\n\\n\r\nBut seriously, you've got to watch it to believe it. I don't want to spoil anything. And trust me, you won't regret it.",

            "content": "Warning: spoilers and sarcasm are featured below\r\nHey, are you feeling down because you have this great idea for an anime but keep getting rejected by every studio that you try to sell your pitch to? Well it's time to turn that frown upside down, because Studio Trigger will gladly produce your anime for you, as long as your anime contains a few specific things of course. Here are the three easy steps that you must follow in order to have your anime green lit by Studio Trigger!\r\n1. Make sure to have a LOT of steamy hot fan service. It's best if your main source ofsex appeal comes from your leading female character, because being hot waifu material > having a personality and depth.\\n\\n\r\n2. Have your main character (who has to be an edgy teen btw) fly around in a giant mecha all the time because BIG ROBOTS ARE AWESOME!!!\\n\\n\r\n3. ADD ALIENS! Especially as twist villains for the final arc of your story, because there's nothing better than kids in giant robots fighting against aliens in FREAKING SPACE!!!\\n\\n\r\nFollow these simple steps and your anime will be practically guaranteed to end up as Trigger's next unsuccessful imitation of great anime like NGE and TTGL just like SSSS.Gridman is!\\n\\n\r\n...On second thought, maybe you should just try your luck with a no-name studio.\\n\\n\r\nI'm starting to think that creativity died at Studio Trigger. Yet although they seem to consistently recycle the same exact ideas, I've still enjoyed their works. I loved Kill la Kill because it somewhat deviated from the traditional Trigger formula and was just a great and fun anime all around. I even really liked Darling in the FranXX up until they butchered the ending because Trigger just HAD to have aliens. But with StopSoundingSoStupid.Gridman (Seriously, are the four S's supposed to mean something?), it just felt hollow. I never got the impression that this anime was trying to stand out and make a name for itself, and it unfortunately ended up being painfully average because of it.\\n\\n\r\nInterestingly enough, my score for this anime fluctuated several times throughout its run time. I actually did find some episodes to be enjoyable and even thought provoking, yet others were the embodiment of mediocrity equipped with bad character interactions and bland scenarios. The only things that remained consistent throughout were Rikka's sexy legs. But even those thick thighs weren't enough to salvage the dysfunctional plotline of this anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe setting is quite bizarre. Our protagonist has come down with a rather unfortunate case of amnesia that is poorly explained near the end of the anime and finds himself in a city surrounded by a bunch of giant kaiju that only he can see. But he doesn't really seem too concerned about any of this. In fact, he doesn't seem to care about anything at all except for getting in Rikka's pants. And when other characters finally realize that our hero Yuuta isn't insane and see the kaiju too, they also don't seem to care too much about their situation. And that's one of the glaring issues with this anime. If the characters are completely nonchalant about basically everything, then why should we the viewers care about what's going on? Not that the story itself is anything exciting. It's just a typical monster of the week that Gridman and Yuuta beat up and then everything resets (the damage to the city and the memories of everyone who isn't an important character) because plot. And despite what you may be thinking, there really isn't much more to this anime than that. If anything, it just became even more confusing and convoluted by the end of the show.\\n\\n\r\nFor the most part, the characters are pretty stale. Gridman is the most bland sentient robot ever conceived and is piloted by the most uninspired kid imaginable. Utsumi is that typical freind guy who never does anything useful except crack a joke or two every ten minutes. Rikka is the attractive female lead who's personality unfortunately isn't as good as her looks. Alexis is some random alien that's randomly in this anime because Trigger has an alien fetish. The other characters bar one aren't even worth mentioning.\\n\\n\r\n*This short segment contains spoilers as well as positive thoughts on this anime*\\n\\n\r\nThe one person who keeps this anime from falling below average in my eyes would be Akane. She takes the role of the antagonist, making all of the kaiju herself and trying to kill Gridman and people she doesn't like with them, and the anime literally revolves around her since she is, you know, a god. She seems like a fun and energetic girl at first, but after peeling away her mask, her true colors as a heartless, attention seeking psycho are exposed. And the anime even further sheds light on her intricate and delicate psyche later on in the show. The dream sequence episode, while weird, was one of my favorites from the anime simply because of how it portrayed Akane. She's just a really engaging character who I enjoyed watching. Her body is also pretty hot, I'd say even more so than Rikka's (Yeah, I said it). Akane is definitely the highlight of SSSS.Gridman for me.\\n\\n\r\n*End of spoilers and positivity*\\n\\n\r\nDespite my obvious displeasure with a decent chunk of this anime, it was still semi enjoyable to watch. Sure, the anime doesn't have much heart, but watching a giant robot beat up giant monsters is always fun, despite how repetitive it gets. And Rikka and Akane were a pleasure to watch (for more reasons than one~), so that's always a plus.\\n\\n\r\nShow'sStorySeriouslySucks.Gridman is underwhelming. It never really went anywhere and just felt sort of pointless. A lot of things didn't make sense and when the anime did try to explain something, it usually just made it even more confusing. Let's hope that Studio Trigger is able to improve with their next project.\\n\\n\r\nAnd hopefully not include any aliens.",

            "content": "SSSesth Gridman is the newest name monster from the studio everyone knows and which creativity after Inferno Cop has been entirely limited to their ability to make up shitty names that don't mean anything. eSeSeSeS. Gridman's biggest achievement is confirming that the future won't be changing this to any direction, especially not for better.\r\nStory:\r\nDude who has red hair starts hearing his computer talking to him and claiming he is this thing called Gridman while girl who he has never seen before in his life is now living with him or something. Then they start arguing over if the pc really talked. Less than half wayinto episode 1 and I was already confident that this is going to be a veeery long show despite its 1-cour length. \\n\\n\r\nRest of the writing centers around student life, chats about sandwiches, monster of the week epicness, reveals regarding the daily life of our cast, some mystery elements that are mysterious because they don't make any sense, mecha fights and new things that matter even less than the events before them. Also aliens with swords and yu-gi-oh arm bands, because more > less, apparently. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\\n\r\nDid I mention the dude has red hair? Well, that's not exactly important, but I just can't figure out what else there supposed to be to him. He also suffers from a memory loss which is the single worst trope invented by man, which is great because that's exactly the type of lame shit this show deserves.\\n\\n\r\nRikka is the best girl because she sighs every 3 seconds and sounds both disinterested and bored, which is also great because I imagine she has become self-aware and has realized she is a character in this fucking thing. *sigh* \"this out of all anime\" \\n\\n\r\nThere are also other characters here. One of them stares at the sky and it looks like she is finding it very fascinating, she is also insane or mentally ill / both. Another has glasses so that's kinda cool, always need that one motherfucker who can't see shit. I would love to mock all of these characters for more meaningful and less shallow reasons, but they are shells whose presence is entirely limited to their character models. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nGliddoman's animation consists of completely still background images, extremely slow tempo walking scenes and character interaction / dialog moments where the character animation is like 2 frames-per-second and there is no in-between animation at all: what we see is teleportation without any continuity. I have personally never seen anything like this in my life, but I am sure they managed to execute the whole thing with 70% less animators than is normally required, so if we are looking into pros: very few people have been required to waste their time working with this awful piece of anime. Kudos.\\n\\n\r\nThe monster design is great. The first thing that appears is basically oversized, pink colored Donatello who has a dragon head in the place of a navel. Which is amazing since its shell is so full of spikes it well get stuck on any surface it lays on its back and if it falls on its stomach, its neck will break. This is pretty much why I am finding this show to be worth of watching, I have had a blast imaging this fking thing yelling \"I am invincible!\" then tripping over and never moving again. Its movements are even better. Waddles from side to side and occasionally looks like a passable, decent quality slide show....\\n\\n\r\nSounds:\\n\\n\r\nWhy would anyone even want music amirite. It's so much more pleasant to listen teenagers acting like they are surprised. I can't figure out if this is really supposed to be voice acting or a parody of the seiyuu industry. Dude sees a Gozilla in the sky and gets almost as excited about it as a house wife who is ironing her husband's socks. \"Oh wow, this shit's great.\" Except that's the first time he ever sees one. Or maybe not because he suffers from memory loss. On the other hand, I care way too little to consider more possibilities. \\n\\n\r\nAlso I kinda lied. There are songs, but they mainly exist in action scenes and don't work very well. First one lasted like 15 seconds and was terrible trailer-music-tier stuff but lacking anything that makes them good. The second lasted approximately 4 seconds and I am still uncertain if it was really a song or the sound of a siren just before its battery runs dry. The third song was an anime opening you hear typically in seasonal slice of life shows except here it was inserted in the middle of an action sequence and its vocals were more visible than the action itself. I am not sure why anyone would want to make something like this or think this is a good idea, but whatever, since everything else is already terrible, why not make the sounds awful, too, I guess.  \\n\\n\r\nConclusions:\\n\\n\r\nSSS Gridman Sucks. The last S. is really supposed to be moved at the end of the sentence, hence the dot in title. Thanks Triggarh",

            "content": "When SSSS.Gridman first began, people really didn\u2019t like it. I think a lot of the surface-level elements turned people away, especially since the first few episodes were fairly slow and predictable. But once the show actually got going, the actual content there kept us coming back week after week, and it ended up being not just one of my favorite shows of its season, but of the year as a whole.\r\n\tGridman is a precarious mix of genres, balancing seemingly everyday school life against giant mecha fights. The former goes against what people expect from mecha anime, and is likely responsible for the show being labeledas slow. However, these two disparate halves somehow built off each other, with the tension of the daily life feeding into the catharsis of the action scenes. Since it's the more mundane material that seems to have garnered the most criticism, that'll be the focus of this review.\\n\\n\r\n\tInterestingly enough, this means I really don\u2019t need to talk about Yuta. While he may pilot Gridman, his amnesiac protagonist bit gets in the way of him having a particularly interesting school life, and instead Rikka steps forward as the protagonist. Rikka is the more emotionally-driven of the two, and while she\u2019s aware of all the kaiju shenanigans going on in the show, it\u2019s never really her main drive.\\n\\n\r\n\tInstead, Rikka\u2019s conflict is her trying to reconnect with Akane, the antagonist of the series with whom she used to be close friends. Akane creates the kaiju that terrorize the city, and it would be so easy to just view her as the villain, especially since this is how she presents herself. But unlike the other protagonists, Rikka doesn't look at her through this lens. By refusing to play on Akane\u2019s terms of mecha and kaiju, she is the one who is able to genuinely reach out to Akane and save her from her isolation. This story of reconnection could have been treated as secondary to the main action, but instead it\u2019s given the same level of attention, receiving much of the show\u2019s expressive animation and relatable character moments.\\n\\n\r\n\tAlso, the show absolutely nails atmosphere. Though everything seems mostly normal for the first half of the run, the show's use of its claustrophobic camera and tendency for long pauses serve to constantly instill a sense of discomfort in the viewer as they try to figure out why the world seems off. The summer heat is tangible and oppressive, and the rainy days are all the more miserable. The soundtrack goes a long way to sell these scenes, and the opening and ending are both fantastic.\\n\\n\r\n\tBriefly, I\u2019ll talk about how the show handles homage. I think a lot of the criticism leveled at the show is based on it being too steeped in references to other shows, to the point that animator for the original Gridman Obari Masami complained that they weren\u2019t doing anything new with the material. With that said, I don\u2019t mind having these callbacks as fanservice to fans of the original, especially since they don\u2019t conflict with the story being told. Plus, how upset can I really be over all of the character designs being based on obscure Transformers? That\u2019s adorable.\\n\\n\r\n\tIn conclusion, Gridman is just really good, you know? If you\u2019ve been on the fence about watching Gridman because of the initial negative reception, I'd say it's worth trying for yourself. I'm still not entirely clear why so much of the community is down on this show, but I absolutely loved it, and I hope that more people will give it a chance.",

Now, I'm not saying all Mechca anime is bad because that's true. There are some good one out there... but there is more bad than good. SSSS.Gridman has such a simple plot. Kaiju comes, transform into Gridman, and done. Rinse and repeat pretty much. They might add a bit more \"drama\" to the mix but the formula wouldn't change since it's so simple. I'm not saying \"simple\" is also bad, anime such anime \"Yuru Camp\" is so simple but so satisfyingto watch because the characters make up for it. I see a lot of people be like Rikka is different or something about her is special. What in the hell are you even looking at? She's literally those typical character where she value friends and whatnot and will do her best to save those relationship ties that she has with them. And trust me, Yuuta isn't any better. This anime is literally a cover of a book with no story inside of the book itself.\\n\\n\r\nSubject to change but I don't think it will.",

            "content": "SSSS.Gridman is an anime inspired by the old tokusatsu series Denkou Choujin Gridman. It takes what's interesting about the genre and adjusts it to fit the modern day's standards. Thanks to that the final product turned out to be an interesting mix of old and new. Add to it the outstandingly good execution and you get a masterpiece that can keep you glued to the screen with every episode.\r\nThe main character of the anime is Yuuta Hibiki - a high school boy that wakes up at Rikka Takarada's home having no memories at all. At the Junk Shop, which belongs to Rikka's family, there's anold computer called Junk. And inside of it there's Gridman - the Hyper Agent telling Yuuta there's a mission he needs to fulfill. Yuuta lets his school friend Utsumi in on what's happened and when huge monsters called kaijuu start attacking the city, these three form the Gridman Alliance and with the help of the robot inside Junk, they start fighting said monsters and begin the journey to discover the truth about the city and everyone in it.\\n\\n\r\nSince the very beginning there's a feeling that there's more to the show than it might appear at first. In what could be labelled as a naive show targetting the younger audience there's always the feeling that something is off and with every episode the eerie atmosphere becomes more apparent, which only makes the experience better. I loved the mysterious atmosphere of the weird, closed off city and the scenery filled with giant dormant monsters reminding you that even the calm days aren't how they should be.\\n\\n\r\nWhat adds to the atmosphere is the background music, or rather the frequent lack thereof. Because of that (and of the animation) some scenes look pretty slow, but I wouldn't call it a bad thing in this particular case. The music does always appear during the fight scenes, though, and it's fitting and good. I also liked both the opening and ending song. There's a song I liked even more, though, and namely Yume no Hero - the original Gridman's opening song - which the original version of we can hear in the last episode and there was also a rearrangement of it played before. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the fights, what's much more outstanding about them than the soundtrack are the visuals. The fight scenes are super good and in my opinion they only get better with every episode. The CGI used during them looks clean and good quality and it also makes Gridman and the kaijuu look kind of heavy like they are supposed to be. We also get to see lots of cool transformations and gattai. Many cool combinations appeared throughout the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe visuals are great not only during the fight scenes. There are rather many still frames, but I perceive them as an artistic move, which I like. But when things are moving, the animation is fluid, especially when there's a lot of action going on. The backgrounds are full of details, the characters have nice designs (I also love their eyes) and there is nothing about the visual side of the show that I could complain about.\\n\\n\r\nI found the characters to be another really strong point of the anime. Our main trio is totally likeable. Although devoid of some super unique traits, they feel genuine and their actions are understandable. And that's exactly what I like about them. They are just a group of normal high school kids whose everyday life changes because of the strange events happening. One could complain about the main character being bland, but there's a reason behind that, and it's more than just the fact that he has no memories. There's also Akane Shinjou - the girl everyone loves and a friend of Rikka. The Neon Genesis Junior High Students are a crazy but lovable and useful bunch, whose eccentricity doesn't fail to make the viewers smile. There's also a certain kaijuu boy that grew on me over time. The supporting characters are also fine. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the references - there seem to be many of them, but as someone that has never been into tokusatsu shows, I can't say much about them, unfortunately. I feel like I'm missing out a bit, but it's not like being knowledgeable about this kind of thing is necessary to enjoy the show. I'm sure the references will add to the experience for people that are more familiar with that stuff, though. I also wanted to mention one thing I looked up before, and namely the background of a certain girl that played an important role in the episode 6. If you are interested in that, I recommend looking up a kaijuu named Anosillus. It's quite moving. Episode 6 is also the one the aforementioned rearrangement of the old opening song was played in.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum it up, I see SSSS.Gridman as a show made of love and care for details. In spite of it taking inspirations from other things, it feels like it has its own identity. The quality of the anime is super good. To me this show is one of a kind. Simple, yet interesting and satisfying. I found it to be extremely enjoyable and I highly recommend giving it a try!",

While being heavily inspired by the 1993 live-action series Gridman the Hyper Agent, this version is loaded with visual references to numerous tokusetsu series and mecha anime of the past \u2013 Space Runaway Ideon, Getter Robo, Evangelion, several iterations of Gundam and more receive stunning rendition scenes that serve as quick but effective throwbacks appealing to nostalgia for the die-hard fans of yesterday. Whilst on the other side of the community, Gridman had managed to conquer the ever-present \u201cbest girl\u201d debate of the season, with each week providing more material and support for why each girl and this series is worth one\u2019s attention. Hell, there was even a theory made halfway into Gridman about whether or not Rikka was secretly pregnant with the protagonist\u2019s child the entire time (there\u2019s actually a fair amount of evidence about it, not gonna lie.) But first impressions are usually not what they seem and this saying holds true for Gridman, as the very first episode comes off as anything but the fun mecha shows its constantly compared to.\\n\\n\r\nSSSS.Gridman introduces its audience with several long shots lasting for uncomfortable periods of time \u2013 focusing on rather mundane things like a pile of shoes and dozens of students leaving school for the day, with only the sounds of cicadas being heard. Our protagonist Yuta wakes up in an unfamiliar room, with an unfamiliar female sitting across from him. The unfamiliarity continues as shots continue having characters fail to dominate the frames they are in, often outsized by their environment; constrained into small spaces of scenes. And when characters are allowed to dominate frames, the camera often takes weird perspectives placed either above or below their eyelines, almost intimately close to these characters. There\u2019s a strong, distinct direction present that forces the viewer to rarely ever feel comfortable about what is being presented, coupled by a minimalist-style soundtrack that further emphasizes a quiet, environmental atmosphere rarely ever attributed with mecha shows. Its presentation is one that is more inclined to push anime fans away given just how different the show appears to contrast with the majority of anime airing nowadays. Some may call it a series with striking directing techniques that ultimately lacks proper direction. but I would urge otherwise as Gridman still has a lot of upside that helped make it one of the most popular shows of the season.\\n\\n\r\nThe story focuses on amnesiac Yuta Hibike, who after finding himself in the home of fellow classmate Rikka Takarada meets a robot known as Gridman inside of an old computer. This has coincided with a sudden appearance of giant unmoving Kaiji, with one abruptly attacking the city causing Yuta to merge with Gridman to battle the Kaiju. In the aftermath however, the city around them appears rebuilt, with those having died being forgotten and people\u2019s memories being reset around this fact, all bar the main characters. Because of this, Yuta attempts to stop the Kaiji from attacking and uncover the truth behind these disappearances. The mystique behind these events is what ultimately drives the story forward, however majority of the first half of Gridman almost rigidly follows a simple formula akin to tokusetsu monster-of-the-week: slight plot development occurs, monster appears, big hero/monster fight ensues with the heroes coming out on top, maybe some followup and repeat. This is not necessarily a detriment to the show as it works well to further establish most side characters and the setting in general, but once again it\u2019s a tool that can easily alienate more viewers looking to see why Gridman is so well-liked.\\n\\n\r\nGridman\u2019s cast may not be seriously complex in their characterization nor development but still remain a solid aspect of the series, especially with the chemistry between more characters. The way each of the high school students are able to bounce personalities off each other is impressive and the least someone like myself can ask for of characters barely important to the plot. Although there still are some specific characters worth mentioning: Yuta as an amnesiac portrays a relatable human response in trying to carry on as usual to the best of his ability, reflecting how many of us will often try and find a sense of normalcy, coping to the best of our abilities instead of shutting out entirely despite the desire of sometimes wanting to. Meanwhile on the other side of the spectrum, Akane serves as the main antagonist to Yuta and friends, spending most of her time inside her eerie room, creating Kaiji inspired from daily frustrations and petty grudges. Underneath her outward reputation as a talented student lies a psychologically twisted girl barely able to be kept contained. Thematically, the series dangles along threads of memory and connection and both of these characters are integral to these ideas.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as Gridman's production value is concerned, this is where the series really shows off its strengths. Distinct character designs and colour palette that never overwhelms a single scene, detailed backgrounds that give off an ominous sense of uncertainty, subtle edits to further keep the audience away from any settled feeling. Its animation is somewhat limited considering the number of stills used in Gridman but does utilize a significant amount of 3D animation in conjuction with 2D animation, and here is where opinions can get easily divisive. From the time of Gridman\u2019s airing, anime still has a long way to go with improving CG animation to looking anywhere near as appealing as traditional-style animation, and when both styles are used in the same show, the consensus thought is that it comes off clunky, immersion-breaking and overall detrimental to the show visually. But Gridman stands as an exception to this, with the CG-animated fights coming across more reminiscent to that of tokusetsu battles. In this way, these action scenes give off a similar sense of scale of larger-than-life monsters duking it out, destroying vehicles and buildings as if they were mere toys. These moments also encapsulate what I feel are the best parts of SSSS.Gridman.\\n\\n\r\nWhenever a Kaiju attacks and Gridman, the hero and giant ass-kicking robot enters the fray, everything regarding the purposeful directing fades out: the unsettling camera angles, the absence of music, the alienation \u2013 all of the uncanniness is annihilated for this moment courtesy of the triumphant emergence of the hero confronting the evil. All of the sudden the cameras move into action, the music blares out, frames are completely dominated by the two behemoths. It doesn\u2019t last very long but for this moment we as viewers finally are at ease and it becomes a glorious release of pent-up emotion. Expert manipulation of the audience that while it may sound simple on paper, could only work under the guise of splendid filmmaking ability. And that, is where SSSS.Gridman truly shines.\\n",

            "content": "SSSS.Gridman is a truly bizarre experience. After the monumentally disappointing Darling in the FranXX and the surprisingly worthwhile Planet With, this show completes the year\u2019s holy trinity of super robot anime by being a confusing mixed bag that is a nightmare to discuss. While it doesn\u2019t exactly go full Evangelion, there are still references to it as well as stylistic similarities between the two. However, there\u2019s more to this peculiar anime than just being another run-of-the-mill mecha series.\r\nFirst and foremost, this is both a tokusatsu and super robot anime. Sparing you the lengthy history of both concepts, it\u2019s clear that the trappings of the twogenres aren\u2019t easy to deal with in contemporary anime\u2014or any anime in the case of tokusatsu. Case in point: while reused animation is common in mecha series, they\u2019re mainly utilized for robot transformations and special attacks. However, SSSS.Gridman goes as far as to rewind even non-action scenes, creating unnecessary repetition. Studio Trigger also decided to render the Gridman and its Kaiju foes using CGI, and the jarring blend between these 3D models and their 2D environment causes a serious case of the uncanny valley. Not helping matters is how these hulking titans continually swap between 2D and 3D, making everything they interact with --i.e. the road, the cars, the debris, etc.-- become a visual disaster. It\u2019s a shame these graphical problems make the fights harder to follow given their cool choreography and sakuga moments.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style of this series is far from appealing. Aesthetically, the show is incredibly bland. The inconsistent animation can sometimes make the faces look like deformed potatoes, which are further accentuated by the uninspired character designs. The characters look incredibly plain apart from their vibrant eyes, and even the more appealing individuals such as Anti and Rikka seem lacking. Another problem is the awkward movements, specifically the hand and arm motions. Long story short, this show has a bunch of visual oddities that dampen the experience.\\n\\n\r\nIn spite of all the aforementioned problems, SSSS.Gridman has a striking direction. There are moments between fights that highlight a sense of discomfort and eerie quietness, similar to the atmospheric pauses in Evangelion. These scenes feel pretentious at times, but the clever framing of shots that illustrate the emotional distance of the characters makes them more engrossing than not. Film buffs might find this directing standard fare, but such a thing is noteworthy in the anime landscape. The dream sequences in episode nine are particularly fun to witness and showcase the creative talent of director Akira Amemiya.\\n\\n\r\nS^4 Gridman heavily restrains its usage of background music. Most non-action scenes lack an accompanying soundtrack. You would think the absence of music makes their purpose more meaningful, but sadly this isn\u2019t the case. Since the soundtracks aren\u2019t utilized frequently, none of them are memorable as a result. However, there is one track that stood out: the opening theme \u201cUnion\u201d by OxT. As an uplifting song, it works as a call to action that plays when the main cast is gaining the upper hand against their Kaiju opponents. The song doesn\u2019t always mesh properly with the sequence since it\u2019s sometimes too quiet, but when it does, be prepared for some epic moments. Sadly, all this can\u2019t be said for the forgettable ending theme.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of SSSS.Gridman is a mixed bag. For every character like Calibur, whose quirkiness comes from his silent, dorky attitude, we have someone boring like Yuta, our unremarkable protagonist. Most of the main characters, including the titular Gridman, are one-dimensional; the most interesting thing about them is their genuine interactions amongst each other. On the other hand, the three antagonists are highly fascinating. Akane is similar to a child trapped in her own sandbox video game world, twisted by her own influence, loneliness, and creations. One of these creations, Anti, is a foil to Gridman. He\u2019s an overly serious edgelord so hell-bent on destroying Gridman that he ends up being hilariously awkward in social interactions. He would even pick fights with other Kaiju simply because of his desire to personally kill Gridman. As for Alexis, his voice and demeanor make him seem incredibly humorous and lackadaisical -- even as he shoves a buzzsaw to someone\u2019s eye.\\n\\n\r\nOne irksome trait the cast share is their tendency to restrict themselves for no proper reason. For example, in episode three, Yuta, Calibur, and Gridman worry the others by disappearing after a Kaiju defeats them, only for them to be on standby the entire time. One could make the argument that rushing back into battle or retreating immediately would have tipped the Kaiju off, but they could have escaped after it left since they can just warp back to the shop. \\n\\n\r\nAll this segues perfectly into SSSS.Gridman\u2019s obscure narrative. The mystery surrounding the show\u2019s existentially horrifying world is unnerving in the sense that the narrative gradually becomes more destructive as secrets begin to unravel, a la FranXX. While I don\u2019t feel the show crosses that line enough to destroy any investment I could possibly have --at least until episode 10-- there\u2019s a fundamental aspect of the world-building that doesn\u2019t strike me the right way. \\n\\n\r\nTiptoeing around spoilers, one of the major gimmicks of this show's world is that everyone\u2019s memories of the dead are altered when a character dies at the hands of a Kaiju, or a Kaiju gets destroyed. With the exception of the surviving combatants, everyone\u2019s mind starts to become hazy. It\u2019s not quite on the level of Re:Zero where society begins to doubt the existence of certain individuals, but it\u2019s still a frustrating gimmick that doesn\u2019t entirely make sense. As such, the show\u2019s convoluted narrative makes it difficult to recommend. The asspulls in the second half only adds to this problem.\\n\\n\r\nDespite its various shortcomings, SSSS.Gridman is still an entertaining mecha anime. The fights are fun to watch, the banters between the characters are engaging, and the twisted hellhole of a world leaves viewers with much to ponder. Maybe I would have enjoyed this more if I\u2019m familiar with the tokusatsu genre, but I doubt such knowledge would make this show any less difficult to unpack. It\u2019s an enigmatic mixed bag that I am glad to have watched.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOh, and on top of the Eva references, this show makes a Gurren Lagann reference, so there\u2019s another link between the Gridman Planet With FranXX trio.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWritten/Edited by: CodeBlazeFate \\n\r\nProofread by: Peregrine and Skittles",

            "content": "SSSS.hit!\r\nIs Studio Trigger aware that they are not required to produce wack-ass anime ad infinitum?  It feels like they take pleasure in discovering new ways to SSSS.hit all over your computer screens, just to see how desperate we are for a new Mecha anime.  Perhaps the success of Inferno Cop went to their heads, giving them a false sense of entitlement to shove even worse rubbish up our collective SSSS.hit(holes), in hopes that we would gobble it up like a bunch of mindless, horny drones.  I can\u2019t blame a player for wanting to get paid, but I can certainly blame Studio Triggerfor wanting to get paid\u2026\u2026\u2026\\n\\n\r\n\u2026What?  Why are you staring at your screen like that?  Nothing to see here.\\n\\n\r\nSSSS.Gridman is an anime that utilizes a formulaic approach to present a vapid adventure about a young boy who merges with a Mecha to fight outlandish \u201cmonsters\u201d in a no holds barred, explosive battle to the death.  The fights, themselves, are  standard-fare.  Emulating the exaggerated absurdity of Gurren Lagann, but never quite reaching the eccentricity of Kill la Kill.  But while the former two attempted to stitch together (see what I did there? **Kill la Kill reference**) an acceptable narrative with their own, unique brand of action-comedy, SSSS.Gridman fails to capture the viewer\u2019s attention in any meaningful fashion.  Per the cyclical, episodic framework, each 23 minute offering utilizes a \u201crinse and repeat\u201d approach, where a new \u201cmonster\u201d/Kaiju enters the city only to be defeated by the Gridman and reset everyone\u2019s memories (except for those directly involved), as if the crisis never happened.\\n\\n\r\nBy virtue of being repetitious, Studio Trigger, once again, displayed a general lack of ambition and creativity, especially with the addition of a superfluous river rafting episode, to give the staff an excuse to animate the girls in scantily clad outfits.  Furthermore, SSSS.Gridman is not funny.  The entertainment is lackluster, at best.  The concepts and themes are tedious.  And dare I mention the plot?\u2026It\u2019s not like the staff cared to mention it in any detail.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the worst aspect of the show is the prosaic, uninspired characters.  None of  them say/do anything worth remembering, nor do they come off as likable or worth caring about.  Yuta is your typical \u201conly I can save the day\u201d protagonist, with a plain, \u201cnice guy\u201d demeanor and a distinct red hair color.  His rival, Akane Shinjou, is a cold, despondent female with a murderous rage that can only be quelled by generating new Kaiju to terrorize the city and anyone who has wronged her.  Why, you may ask: because she\u2019s a psychotic bitch (need I elaborate?).  Akane\u2019s manipulator, Alexis Kerib, is the show\u2019s token evil \u201calien,\u201d to guide events to their ultimate conclusion. Studio Trigger, much to my dismay, seems to excel at producing low quality characters that exude pure nothingness, except for some hackneyed quarks and superficial characteristics.\\n\\n\r\nThe only positive aspect about SSSS.Gridman is the OST, not that it was anything spectacular, but it accomplished its goal of being mildly entertaining.  But if we consider that an OP/ED are merely shallow, trivial components of what a show truly entails, then it\u2019s quite the condemnation to the substantive portions of the show in question.  \\n\\n\r\nWouldn\u2019t you agree?\u2026",

            "content": "I went into SSSS Gridman with high expectations because outside of me being big fan Gainax/Trigger I wanted to see if Trigger its wounds after they got drill blasted by Darling in the Franxx by A1/Cloverworks that left a nasty wound which needed a lot of time to recover from. I actually thought the series would go back it's Little Witch Academia/Kill la Kill days where it a nice blend of style and substance. However, after watching all 12 episodes of this show subbed and the first 8 episodes dubbed I can definitely say that this is not Trigger as it's best. In fact, thisis one of Trigger's weaker shows. I know you guys are thinking right now.\\n\\n\r\n> Trigger hasn't got a big library of anime.\\n\r\nWell if I had to personally rank every anime from Trigger, it would go as follows.\\n\\n\r\nBest.\\n\\n\r\nLittle Witch Academia (TV)\\n\\n\r\nLittle Witch Academia: The Enchanted Parade\\n\\n\r\nKill la Kill\\n\\n\r\nLittle Witch Academia OVA\\n\\n\r\nSpace Patrol \\n\\n\r\nInferno Cop\\n\\n\r\nWhen Supernatural Battles Became Common Place\\n\\n\r\nSSSS Gridman\\n\\n\r\nKiznaiver\\n\\n\r\nDarling in the Franxx\\n\\n\r\nWorst\\n\\n\r\nAs you can see here SSSS Girdman is in the bottom 3 meaning that the show was clearly not triggered at it's finest. In fact, I go as far that this is Trigger holding back as well playing it too safe, This is not to say that SSSS Girdman was a awful series as I thought it was a average to below average series however after watching the trailer for Promare you can easily tell that Trigger put more effort for Promare and as a result SSSS Girdman feels and functions like a side project that the B team for Trigger decided to work on this while the A team for Trigger went to work on Promare and it clearly shows from the plot, characters, and writing quality.\\n\\n\r\nStory.\\n\r\nThe story follows Yuuta Hibiki, who is an amnesiac first-year high school student living in the fictional Japanese city of Tsutsujidai. He soon meets the Hyper Agent Gridman in an old computer, who stated that the boy has a mission he must fulfil, as he sets out to find the meaning to those words and his memory loss. The sudden appearance of Kaiju would eventually change the usual dynamics of Yuuta and his classmates. Hibiki is able to merge with Gridman to fight kaiju, but after the kaiju attacks, people's memories are reset and those who die are forgotten. As the \"Gridman Alliance\", Hibiki and his friends now seek to stop the kaiju and uncover the truth behind the disappearances, with assistance from mysterious friends of Gridman that can transform into weapons Gridman can use in combat.\\n\\n\r\nThe word dull is honestly the best word to describe the story of SSSS Girdman. While it wasn't actually awful by any means it just so dull and at times uninteresting to follow. The series basically follows your classic monster of the week formula where set kaiju comes in to cause trouble in the city then they get defeated by Girdman and the series goes back to the status quo. Rinse and repeat.\\n\\n\r\nAlong with the show's monster/kaiju of the week formula, the series uses a certain plot device that I have grown to dislike over the years and that is Amnesia. If you don't know what Amnesia is then is basically a person who has no memory thanks to a certain event that caused him to lose memories and they essentially walking husks on screen until set character of set series gets they memory back. It is a plot device that essentially takes a big shit of the plot for set show as set show is literally forced to follow every amnesiac plot device possible and it's honestly tedious to watch.\\n\r\nSSSS Girdman is no different to this and as a result, the series was a chore to watch as we just see this our amnesia protagonist defeat Kanju left and right without a second thought.\\n\\n\r\nWhen the show finally stops being this generic monster of the week in the last couples the series is being a boring God story with our main antagonist Akame and surprise it's generic as hell just like the rest of this series. Honestly what the hell were you thinking Trigger!!!\\n\\n\r\nFinally, did a forget that Trigger was completely holding back when they did decide to make this show. I understand Trigger wanted to play itself after the disaster that was Franxx but unfortunately there is a huge difference between playing itself and simply holding back for no reason and it really shows.\\n\\n\r\nIf there was any silver lining to SSSS Girdman to speak of it was the show was simply a fun throwback to not only the mecha anime genre from the past but Tokusatsu genre as a whole. While I personally cannot get into the Tokusatsu genre, I will admit it genre has its appeal and anyone who is a fan of the Tokusatsu genre would probably have a good time with SSSS Girdman. It's such a shame the narrative isn't all that good to back it up.\\n\r\nOverall the story of SSSS Girdman was shallow that was plagued with cheap plot devices.\\n\r\n3/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\r\nThe characters in SSSS Girdman were easily the weakest part of SSSS Girdman. They aren't terrible but they don't stand out all that much outside of a certain character trait for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nYuuta is your typical mecha/high school boy shounen protagonist that we all have seen before. Thanks to his amnesia in the narrative, he has no real personality to speak off. He doesn't grow as a character all that much and just simply a bore to watch. Even more boring than Katsuhira from Kiznaver.\\n\r\nRikka started off as a decent character at first but my god did she devolved into boring ass meme as the series progresses where the only she had going for was her sexy thick tights.\\n\r\nShou is just there. He doesn't offer much to the story other to be a semi-useless sidekick for Yuuta.\\n\r\nThe only slightly decent main character in the show was Akane as she has a decent motivation of killing all the Girdman. I really enjoyed how after she had peeled her cute face as she turned into a proper psycho. She was the most entertaining thing about this subpar series.\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters were just as interesting as watching those dumb Channel Awesome anniversary specials on Youtube.\\n\r\nOverall the characters in SSSS Gridman were very dull.\\n\r\n4/10\\n\\n\r\nVisuals.\\n\r\nCompared to the unpolished Trigger+ Cloverworks that was Darling in the Franxx the visuals in SSSS were pretty appealing for the most part. The characters were very distant and pretty to look at thanks to the beautiful smooth colour palette that was used to colour each character, Kanj and Gridman mecha itself which was nicely designed. The background scenery was well drawn as it had a lot of detail.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was pretty solid for what it was however at the time it got a bit choppy in certain fights least it's not as bad as Franxx second half although the CGI itself could have been a lot better as it rather janky at times.\\n\r\n7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is alright for what it is but not that memorable.\\n\r\nThe opening and ending themes were decent but nothing too special.\\n\r\nAs for sub vs dub well, this was a tricky one because I only saw the last 2 episodes subbed as I mainly watched this show dubbed and it was great and it manages to surpass the sub which was already pretty good on its own. The voice actors really did an excellent job with the roles they were given as it was well acted and nicely directed.\\n\r\n6.5/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts.\\n\r\nWhy Trigger why do you do this to me...\\n\r\nI really wanted to like SSSS Girdman I really do, but the series was ultimately average at best and lacklustre at worst. The story was very bland that has a boring episodic narrative that was mixed with weak writing, The characters were as interesting as eating eggs with no salt as they all lack any personality to speak off other than memes and generic character traits. The only things that were good about this show were the visuals, soundtrack and the English dub everyone was mediocre at best. It was honestly sad that the way Trigger didn't put a lot of effort into this project as I feel they put more effort into the movie Promare which is set to release in 2019 while Trigger ended up giving this show to they B team and it clearly shows. This show would have been better off as a 6 episode OVA instead of a 12 episode mediocre Trigger feast that we ultimately got.\\n\r\nNow if I think about it I think this is Trigger second worst series that they made because least Kizaiver had some interesting elements things that made the series a somewhat decent watch despite its massive flaws. This show is nothing more but a love letter to the Tokusatsu genre and nothing else.\\n\r\nUnless you're into the Tokusatsu genre as well as LA HOT THICK TIGHTS MEMES XD I cannot recommend this show to people especially who are Trigger fans such as myself. \\n\r\nYou're honestly better watching Planet With or King of Braves series over this.\\n\\n\r\nBetter luck next time Trigger. \\n\r\nAlso for the love of God Trigger please do not screw up Promare I'm begging you.\\n\r\nFinal Score 5/10",

            "content": "Only a few months after releasing one of the most controversial anime of the year that caused a huge stir in the anime fandom, studio TRIGGER is back with, another one! Collaborating with Tsuburaya Productions, they bring to you, SSSS.Gridman. It pays homage to the original Gridman and the Superhuman Samurai Syber Squad series from the \u201990s. Also, the tokusatsu shows such as the Ultraman franchise and lastly, to good old Gainax. There are many otaku culture references throughout, mostly to do with Evangelion, especially the episodes that have the Anno Hideaki directing style and feel to it. This is an anime that is packedwith vexing mysteries, it puts forth a lot of interesting questions and conveys a wide variety of themes. If you fancy the \u2018more about the journey than the destination\u2019 type of stories than this one is for you.\\n\\n\r\nThe story begins with a first-year high schooler in Yuuta Hibiki, a protagonist that is already shrouded in mystery, he wakes up to discover he has no memories. After a series of events, he meets the Hyper Agent Gridman who is inside an old computer, which is referred to as, \u201cJunk.\u201d Gridman tells him that he is needed and he has a mission to fulfil, that only he can do it. Everything is happening so fast but with the help from his classmates, Shou Utsumi and Rikka Takarada, he embarks on a quest to realize the revelation from Gridman and to regain his lost memories. Part of this quest revolves around in fighting against these giant kaiju that have suddenly appeared and have been causing havoc and destruction. It\u2019s later revealed that his fellow classmate Akane Shinjou has been designing these creatures who are then brought to life by a menacing being that has been influencing and guiding Akane in Alexis Kerib. \\n\\n\r\nSSSS.Gridman uses the \u2018monster-of-the-week\u2019 formula where Akane designs a new Kaiju that Alexis brings to life, and Yuuta, who is aided by his friends and a special team of characters\u2014who are essentially the Hyper Agent\u2019s assist weapons\u2014go out to defeat the creatures and protect the city with the help of Gridman. Yuuta is Gridman's partner and is able to merge with him through the Primal Acceptor device which then he uses the phrase, \"Access Flash,\" to allow the inter-dimensional being to materialize in this world. What Yuuta and the others find puzzling is after the colossal-like battles, the city has seemingly been restored and everyone\u2019s memory but their own has been wiped clean of those events. There is always a twist around every corner of this story, everyone besides the main cast also, cannot remember those that were murdered by the Kaiju or were caught in the crossfire, it\u2019s as if they never existed. This gives our protagonist even more motivational to search for the truth behind these mysteries.\\n\\n\r\nInitially, the characters felt bland but you soon realize that they just don\u2019t have the \u2018anime troupe\u2019 kind of personalities. I\u2019d go as far to say they are well-made seeing that they are depicted in a realistic manner\u2014from the tone in which they speak, their vocabulary, the way they react to various situations and their decision making is very relatable to us as the audience. They talk and act like human beings, they are grounded characters who are genuine and share many similar flaws that are common in adolescence. I think the most interesting character in the story is also the one who happens to be the biggest \u2018asshole\u2019 for the majority of the runtime and that is Akane. Sometimes she feels like the main character, seeing that the source of these events is directly in service of the decisions she makes that are heavily influenced by Alexis, and, tragic experiences from her past. She\u2019s trying to create this world where she can escape from a reality that she detests, and Rikka is very much connected to this, which you can also see from the visual messages of the ED.\\n\\n\r\nThere are consequences here for Akane for the power she wields, she develops a God complex, the fine line of reality and morality becomes blurred, and she becomes more unstable that her bubbly fa\u00e7ade can\u2019t suppress her true self. This becomes more evident the more she interacts with a Kaiju she created named Anti, whose sole purpose was to kill Gridman. He ends up becoming the stories anti-hero. Akane is clearly a psychologically damaged individual, harbouring murderous intent towards anyone that pisses her off, even over something so minor. In a turn of events, our protagonists are now the ones trying to wake her from this twisted reality she has created. There is an opportunity for a \u2018redemption\u2019 story for Akane, one that proves to be very controversial once the story reaches the ninth episode and onwards. This is where you really need to pay attention, as these episodes are some of the best directed this year, which is thanks to such an all-star team that is made up of upcoming, promising talents from TRIGGER, Tsuburaya and others.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, director Akira Amemiya has proven to be a formidable talent, he and his team have combined the elements of tokusatsu, kaiju, mecha, and Gainax to evolve the TRIGGER model, thus establishing itself as something new and refreshing. A truly remarkable job production wise. The cinematography is outstanding, the shot composition is done so well along with various other techniques like framing, following the rule of the thirds, leading lines, the centre dominate eye and symmetry that made the imagery aesthetically pleasing, and helped conveyed the visual messages and themes, giving us multiple unique perspectives. The animation, including the CG, was top-notch, fluid, movie-like and firing on all cylinders when it came to Gridman\u2019s encounters with the Kaiju, the action sequences and choreography were eye candy. Visually, the characters designs and layouts were impressive, the background art and architecture were alluring and helped you immerse into this world, especially given the number of details implemented in. \\n\\n\r\nAs you would guess, the score draws a lot of similarities the tokusatsu shows, especially when it comes to Gridman\u2019s main theme and battle sequences. A fair share of scenes, go without background music, but when it plays, it to heighten the mood and emotion, giving those scenes the impactful punch. You\u2019ll get accustomed to the OP, \"UNION\" by OxT, because it serves in many scenes regarding Gridman himself. It\u2019s very catchy. The ED, \"youthful beautiful\" by Maaya Uchida, is a moving ballad. The imagery in both the OP and ED is what really makes them worth watching, they are filled with a lot of symbolism. The casting humanizes these characters, making them feel more authentic and capturing some emotion that \u2018anime troupe\u2019 personalities are incapable of.\\n\\n\r\nSSSS.Gridman isn\u2019t a perfect show, there are definitely areas that could be explored more, there are a few unanswered questions but it made a great effort to tie loose ends within 12 episodes when this is a type of story that needs 12 more. This is not a popcorn flick, it requires you to pay attention to really understand what is going on. It has a bit of everything that is generally liked by most fans of anime from relatable characters, blood-pumping action, amazing visuals, subtle-comedy that is filled with references, there\u2019s twists, suspense and quintessentially executes the \u2018show, don\u2019t tell\u2019 approach. After the controversy from Darling of the FranXX, this love letter to the tokusatsu era is sure to be a mark of something new for studio TRIGGER.\\n",

            "content": "(WARNING: Some spoilers)\r\nI\u2019ll admit being fairly biased when it comes to most TRIGGER produced shows, especially with the likes of Kill La Kill, Little Witch Academia, and Kiznaiver; even Darling in the FranXX, with all the screw-ups it had down the final stretch, was still very enjoyable for me personally. So when the announcement for SSSS Gridman (or as I call it, SSSS Sleepman) came around, I was initially hyped and hoping that this series gives me a more positive outlook for mecha series in general. However, a little later on, when the visuals for the character and kaiju designs were released for the publiceye to see, a part of me thought \u201cthe show is gonna do something to really upset or bore me\u201d. At the time, I genuinely hoped my suspicions were wrong and that I would be able to overlook this sense of doubt I had, so I kept a fair amount of optimism heading into the season of Fall 2018. I mean, even the PV made it seem really promising.\\n\\n\r\nNow when I think about it, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever comprehend why Gridman supposedly deserves so much praise, even if I understand why it does. I understand that my opinion is probably in the minority and that I might get called out by excessively sensitive fans of this show or tokusatsu-related stuff in general. Nevertheless, I want to try to at least explain why I think SSSS Gridman, which is actually based off of a retro tokusatsu series called Ultraman, is the most \u201cover-praised\u201d show I\u2019ve ever watched in a long time.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 2/10\\n\r\nThe story starts off with a young man named Yuuta Hibiki waking up without any prior memories, later befriending the likes of Rikka \u201cThunder Thighs\u201d (a nickname I decided to go with) Takarada amd Shou Utsumi, who said they are his fellow classmates. Yuuta later meets Hyper Agent GRIDMAN through an ancient-as-hell PC, who tells him to \u201cfulfill his purpose\u201d.  All the sudden, a kaiju appears out of nowhere, setting the stage and course for the show.\\n\r\nRight off the bat, the show wants to use the \u201camnesia\u201d factor, a plot device that is often misused, especially in many sci-fi shows. Yuuta\u2019s lack of memories limited his capacity to think or act in a logical manner, and without the likes of Gridman and his friend circle, he probably would be going off making too many ridiculous mistakes. Even the eventual revelations regarding Yuuta\u2019s memories were cheaply written to make him look even more like not just a generic \u201cchosen one\u201d with plot armor, but a literal deus ex machina manifestation. So you\u2019re telling me that the Yuuta we\u2019ve followed throughout the entirety of the show ain\u2019t really Yuuta at all, but actualy Gridman in a \u201cYuuta\u201d body that had NO memories to begin with? Regardless of the details, that\u2019s not exactly the best way to go about with a character you\u2019ve decided to give up making a decent backstory on. Heck, only maybe one character in the entirety of the show got a fairly good structure in terms of background\u2026.I\u2019ll get to that later, though.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the structure of the show itself, it is basically a rinse-and-repeat episodic format. While I\u2019m okay with episodic formats most of the time, this show doesn\u2019t really know how to give much more structure outside of a kaiju/character of the week theme with 15-20 minutes of detached character dialogue and awkward durations of silence during certain frames, usually centered around adolescent school life, followed by 5-10 minutes of wonky, mostly CG-fied action coupled with intentionally cheesy names for transformations and attacks. The first few episodes seem quite fine due to the appeal of the action, but afterwards, you\u2019d have to think it\u2019d get boring due to lack of proper exposition and emotion. When the story finally does get some sort of progression due to the constant atmosphere the show tries to emulate, it\u2019s very underwhelming even with the plot twists that try to be very compelling.\\n\\n\r\nLet me bring some pet peeves I had with the story: apparently, Akane is a main antagonist for the majority of the show, and at one point, was considered the \u201cgod\u201d of this apparently \u201cfake\u201d world that the story takes in, due to the generic backstory of \u201cnot really having many friends, if at all\u201d, and thus wanting to create an ideal world for herself (though it\u2019s later revealed that Alexis played a major part for that in terms of pulling the strings\u2026typical ass villain shenanigans). Our main group did find out at some point that Akane was responsible for making the kaijus that were causing havoc. While I can agree that Akane does not seem like a true villain despite her odd, \u201cfuck everything else\u201d manner, and that they should not go ahead and kill her\u2026.why the hell did they not at least try to physically stop her in some other way? Logically, wouldn\u2019t that provoke the real baddie to take action and reveal himself, so that the good guys can finally face the true adversary? Then the story wouldn\u2019t need to try to overdose the audience with so much mystery elements and force drama at the end to make itself seem more compelling in nature.\\n\r\nLikewise, Akane at some point found out that Yuuta is the vessel of Gridman and the cause of her failures with the artificial kaiu, and was able to physically meet him when he is still a normal human being\u2026.why does she not, at the time, try to kill him when she\u2019s in the perfect position to do so, or even call Alexis to do the dirty job? It really seemed like the backstory around her tried to make an excuse as to why she didn\u2019t try to eliminate the good guys during the handful of times she had the opportunity. The rush to make her a sympathetic antagonist was not very appealing, considering that she displayed no redeemable character qualities to begin with\u2026trying to make her be savvy in tone and mannerism is such a generic gimmick to make gullible viewers buy into her more easily. One more thing, the series\u2019s attempts to be clever with giving clues to the mystery are just nothing more than something to try to keep the audience more interested.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 7/10\\n\r\nFor the most part, the soundtracks are honestly quite solid, but I will say that the opening and ending theme are polar opposites in nature. The opening theme, sung by OxT, is a very grandiose soundtrack that would fit more with most shounen shows...heck, it actually sounds like something that belongs in the likes of stuff like Digimon, Cardfight Vanguard, and Yugioh. The ending theme, on the other hand, sung by Maaya Uchida, who is well known for her contributions to several Chuunibyou theme songs, as well as voicing the main heroine of that show (whom is, coincidentally enough, is also named Rikka\u2026.who woulda thunk it). The visuals of the ending theme, which I want to note here in particular, showcase shots of Rikka and Akane, making them seem very close friends. This isn\u2019t very surprising because the ending theme would be made to fit in shows centered on school drama and/or adolescent romance.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the soundtracks are nice, but very sparse and not utilized enough, because the majority of the show is filled with silent still-frames. The voice acting is kinda lifeless or bland, and any sort of emotion seemed very forced to an attempt to balance out the lack of cohesiveness and chemistry in terms of dialogue.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION: 6/10\\n\r\nFirst off, the 2D animation is actually hella good, and felt very reminiscent of the good ol\u2019 Trigger shows, except they look hella cleaner and more detailed. There\u2019s nothing much else to say about that.\\n\\n\r\nNow here\u2019s a big bugaboo: the CG animation. Now before you say why I have to have such an issue regarding 3D animation, I\u2019ll just say this: blame the number of other shows I\u2019ve watched that literally traumatized me with their eye-burning showcases of horrible CGI usage. To be very honest, the 3D designs ain\u2019t that all bad, but their overall movements, especially during the action scenes, felt very wonky\u2026..in particular, the fake kaijus. Again, it points back to how much this show wants to trap the audience in tokusatsu nostalgia by trying to \u201cperfectly emulate\u201d how tokusatsu shows were produced. The wobbly 3D figurines of the kaijus are supposed to imitate someone walking in a monster costume, and the sequences of Gridman getting bigger are supposed to mirror how tokusatsu shows use camera tricks and angles. However, all of this supposedly masterful elements of \u201ccreating art\u201d is simply the show choosing more \u201cstyle over substance\u201d, which is almost never a good thing in the current era of anime. Because of this, the action scenes just felt very awkward to me.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 4/10\\n\r\nI touched upon some stuff regarding Akane much earlier, so I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll need to repeat for her.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of this show, while not god awful, are too bland to really make enough of an impact. Considering the lack of life the show has in general, the cast themselves just don\u2019t really have any unique perks about them would make them legitimately likable characters.\\n\\n\r\nYuuta looks like someone that should\u2019ve belonged to a frigging shounen series, where he would\u2019ve gotten more of a chance for actual character development as well as a more structured background\u2026instead, he comes off as just a bland, mostly clueless individual who is only relevant because he\u2019s the main vessel of Gridman.\\n\\n\r\nRikka seems like a decent character at the start, due to her acting more like a realistic individual compared to the other cast members, but ultimately got sucked into the usual tropes surrounding \u201cfriendship\u201d, which I felt deconstructed her\u2026in the end, she is simply meme fodder due to her thick-as-f*** thighs.\\n\\n\r\nUtsumi. Is. USELESS. He\u2019s simply the typical middle man wearing glasses who feels compelled to overreact to literally anything and everything he\u2019s not familiar with or prepared for. Ultimately, he\u2019s just a fake main character swept up by this sh**storm of a story.\\n\\n\r\nAkane is a character who actually got the most decent of backstories and characterization in the entire show, but what doesn\u2019t feel right to me is that the show tried too hard to make her a sympathetic antagonist, as I mentioned much earlier. She can be waifu material, I guess, but she ain\u2019t mine. Not with that twisted persona\u2026no, not at all did I feel any sympathy for her, I\u2019m sorry. Even with the interesting revelations at the end regarding the truth about her and the world, that by itself does not give a redeemable impression of her.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast just seem hella bland, too. The kids from the school really are just there for the background, regardless of whether or not they\u2019re there cause it\u2019s some fake world or something. Even the self-named \u201cNeon Genesis\u201d gang of the human avatars of Gridman\u2019s equipment are one-dimensional and quite forgettable in all honesty. Calibur and Max did look cool at first, but the lack of depth just makes them fodder characters only made relevant due to being associated with the main characters. There is one notable character that I did honestly give a nod to: the human Kaiju. His constant drive to want to beat Gridman was initially very obnoxious, but after interactions with the likes of more sane humans like Rikka (cause f*** Akane), as well as watching Gridman\u2019s battles from the sidelines, he started to really question himself as to what his purpose should be, and whether or not he had to find a new reason to fight and/or live. This was, however, downplayed by yet another deus ex machina implementation, where his evolution turned him into basically an entity almost exactly like the original Gridman. I don\u2019t understand why they needed to fall back to such lazy scriptwriting like that for him. As for Alexis, he\u2019s just a typical run-of-the-mill villain who only attempts to seem different by sounding savvy and friendly whenever possible, which is just lame way to go off the status quo.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 4/10\\n\r\nNow before anyone tries to get at me saying I don\u2019t understand tokusatsu\u2026.trust me, I\u2019ve watched quite a bit of tokusatsu films back when I was very young, though I have forgotten the majority of which films exactly that I watched back then. I completely understand the nod to tokusatsu shows that this series tried to make and then emulate. I get it! Ok?! Honestly, though, tokusatsu shows are better off sticking to live action, in my honest opinion. In anime form, it just doesn\u2019t really transfer over well.\\n\r\nWhile I will say that as JUST as a straight-up recreation of tokusatsu, this show does extremely well and would deserve at least a B+ for it. But in terms of being an anime series in general, it doesn\u2019t cut it due to the lack of character structure, superfluous storywriting, and the constant need to puff out copious amounts of nostalgia clouds.\\n\\n\r\nAfter around five to six episodes in, the redundancy of each progressing episode lowered my levels of expectations and excitement, to where I decided to no longer include the show in my reactions on my own YouTube channel. Despite this, watching the show on my own time was not that far off from feeling like a chore up until the final stretch, where the show tried to be interesting with the revelations and plot twists. However, it failed to really appeal to me enough outside of flashy action scenes.\\n\\n\r\nFINAL WORD: \\n\r\nWhile I don\u2019t think this is a necessarily awful show, I honestly believe that this show is just \u201cgassed up\u201d for the most part, and is honestly tasteless. The series tends to use the nostalgia factor and mecha action appeal to try to make itself look good, but lacks in structure and depth in terms of story and characters. It\u2019s honestly one of the most underwhelming shows I\u2019ve ever watched in recent years.\\n\\n\r\nIf you do want to watch something based off retro shows that has actual depth, solid storywriting, and interesting characters, here\u2019s one series I\u2019d recommend: Casshern Sins (based off 1973 Casshan show). That show has heavy themes and well-written characters, and while its nature of its story pacing feels weird, thus making it a hard recommendation, there is considerably more emotion and thought-provoking elements; the action scenes in that show, while not very common, are actually quite entertaining as well.\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re that kind of person who will try to watch and enjoy a show with your brain turned off, I\u2019d say go ahead and knock yourself out. Whether you like it or not, that\u2019s your choice. I\u2019m by no means trying to force you to not watch it or change your perspective on it. I\u2019m simply stating my good-to-honest thoughts regarding a show that people tried to give too much credit to.",

            "content": "Anime consumers typically stay loyal to certain genres or a specific franchise when they purchase goods. I\u2019m not an avid fan of collecting anime merchandise but I've seen people with stacks and shelves filled with anime figures. Out of all the genres though, mecha seems to be one that I\u2019ve always been fascinated by. In recent years, it seems mecha shows have caused a bit of controversy. From Full Metal Panic to Darling in the Frankxx, they can either be really, really good or pretty damn despicable. \r\nPerhaps we shouldn\u2019t jump too far ahead. Studio Trigger has been able to produce series with memorable qualityfrom their lineup. Sure, Darling in the Frankxx was a show that had a divided fan base but who can forget some of their other phenomenal work like Kill la Kill or Little Witch Academia? SSSS.Gridman got announced during Summer 2017 and to think, it also stands out as a celebration for the 25th anniversary of the original Denkou Choujin Gridman from 1993. I think if you\u2019re a fan of tokusatsu programs, then you may be prepared for a treat. But if you\u2019re not, be prepared for a wildly bizarre adventure.\\n\\n\r\nI should say right off the bat that SSSS.Gridman\u2019s synopsis may take a few times to read before getting a first impression of what the show may be really about. It reminds me of a bit of blending between the Western and Japanese culture. We have mecha that somehow reminds me of Transformers, action heroes that feel like they are in the role as Power Rangers, and battles that resemble Pacific Rim. When I was young, there was a time when I watched Power Rangers especially the classics like Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. However, I was never too big in the Ultraman franchise despite also being a tokusatsu classic. When people mention Ultraman, SSSS.Gridman also comes to my mind with the similar style of presentation. The first few episodes quickly unravels a dark plot about Akane Shinjo. As a central antagonist, she has a troubling personality and holds disturbing grudges towards those who \u201cwrongs her\u201d. She could be someone you would call a sociopath and can be highly manipulative. When we meet Akane the first time, it doesn\u2019t take long to realize that there\u2019s something deeply wrong about her inner personality. And honestly, a type of character like her easily brings in trouble into the main story.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, our main story involves protagonist Yuta Hibiki who wakes up with no apparent memory. As the human host of Gridman, he fulfills the role of an action hero. That is, he fights the Kaiju (the main monsters in the show) and protects the innocent. You could say he is the show\u2019s friendly neighborhood Spiderman type of guy who swings into action when trouble knocks at doors. Thankfully, he gets assistance not just from Gridman but also from his friends. These the Gridman Alliance such as Shou, Rikka, and members of the Neon Genesis Junior High Students. The show reveals more about their roles as Yuta develops an alliance between them. However, the elephant in the room should be addressed. Why should you care about a story that resembles something done over a decade ago? \\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned before, most anime fans tends to favor genres that they\u2019ve really experienced with. SSSS.Gridman blends a variety that\u2019s draws the line of science fiction, mecha, and super hero. The plot isn\u2019t hard to understand but may take some take to get attached to. Mainly, some of the first half resembles more of the Monster of the Week format where a hero fights against an enemy, defeats it, and saves the day. But don\u2019t worry, the show does get more complex later on that deals with their world and Akane herself. I\u2019m not going to throw spoilers as the show gets fairly dark as every episode progresses. Maybe that\u2019s even an understatement because right from the start, this show had an unsettling mood. I\u2019ll make this crystal clear now. Characters that die doesn\u2019t just result in death but disappear completely. Erased from seemingly existing. If that doesn\u2019t instill a sense of fear, then I don\u2019t know what does.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond the dark story, we\u2019re also treated with character relationships that play some key emphasis on the show altogether. Akane, Yuta, and Rikka stars as the main characters and they connect on a level that is fairly important. By understanding each other, they establish character connection that the viewers can get invested in. This is especially true to learn about character motivations such as Rikka\u2019s desire to be a hero despite wanting to live a normal life. Or in the opposite case, Rikka\u2019s resentment and desire for revenge for those who wronged her. Indeed, Rikka is a complex character, perhaps one of the hardest to accept but also incredibly enticing to watch for her unpredictable role. Her character expressions often hides her fa\u00e7ade like a monster would. It\u2019s as if she\u2019s always wearing a mask as a beautiful creature on the outside and a harbinger of death on the inside.\\n\\n\r\nWith 12 episodes, some questions popped to my head made me wonder if it\u2019s really enough. Despite the show having a more serious storytelling, it still retains lighthearted moments and humor. Not to mention, we also got an obligatory beach episode to service the fans and one other particular episode to showcase Kajiu\u2019s human-like behaviors. Viewers will also likely to poke fun at some of the character interactions and behaviors such as Akane\u2019s hikikomori-like lifestyle. I think what the producers were aiming for is resurrecting this franchise as a way to pay homage to the original series while crafting its own story. It definitely succeeds at that when committing to its genres without stepping out of its comfort zone.\\n\\n\r\nAmong the many elements of the show, one that\u2019s impossible to evade is the style of its artwork. Studio Trigger has been known to make some extravagant cinematography with its battle contents. Here, SSSS.Gridman succeeds in similar ways. The action is over the top like how a tokusatsu show should be. From the first few episodes, it manages to showcase just how dangerous the Kajiu are and what they can do. Gridman himself has abilities that can neutralize monsters such as energy lasers and is incredibly durable as a fighting Hyper Agent. Make no mistake though. The monsters themselves are formidable ranging from the debut of Ghoulghalias to the deadly Devadadan. Each of them are decorated with impressive fighting capabilities and poses a threat to humanity. Similar to Godzilla in size, it\u2019s nightmares coming to life in their world. The CGI was easy to get accompanied to and adds a colorful style to the overall character designs. Oh and before I forgot to mention, Rikka has some really meaty legs.\\n\\n\r\nI should say while SSSS.Gridman is more suitable for the Japanese audience, it can hit home for newer fans too. Prior to watching this show, I had little experience with tokusatsu related shows outside of Ultraman. Hell, Ultraman was an iconic franchise but that hasn\u2019t been resurrected as a full anime show in a long time (2019 does have one though). Outside of Asia, tokusatsu had limited popularity so perhaps SSSS.Gridman could raise the bar. Funimation dubbed the series for the Western audience we may see more coming ahead.",

            "content": "Opinions on SSSS.Gridman are widely divided: you either love it or hate it. Interestingly enough, those who hate it all have similar criticisms, mainly the premise is unoriginal, the title is stupid, the action just rips off Ultraman, etc. To such comments I would say: do your homework and maybe you\u2019ll learn something. The source material (because yes, this is based on something) was a sentai show from the height of the tokusatsu era. And let\u2019s face it, every sentai show has at least 87% Ultraman-inspired content. It just goes with the territory.\r\nRegarding the story however, Trigger has decided to move away from the typicalPower Ranger-esque scenarios and inject more characterization and atypical pacing into the anime. This, I think is a good thing. The original Superhuman Samurai Syber Squad (yes it is a dumb name, and yes it is misspelled for the sake of alliteration. Blame DIC Entertainment, who brought Gridman to the US market for that.) was probably even less popular in the US than contemporary shows like Beetleborgs. So switching up the story for the anime gives opportunity to rise above mediocre sentai action to something with actual substance. The show mixes the expected kaiju fights with slice-of-life scenes along with unexplained plot points yet to be revealed. Is there a *reason* everyone in the town seems somewhat bland and full of ennui? Is there more to the town then appears at first glance? And WTF is with the insanely immense ever-present daikaiju that everyone just kinda ignores? Only story development and plot progression will tell. =)\\n\\n\r\nAnd the characters themselves play a large role in that development as they themselves progress in their relationships and understanding of the world around them. And character development involves realistic situations in slice-of-life environments, not the continual amped-up, hyper, in your face action of a typical shonen anime. Heck, there\u2019s more fight scenes in MHA, but the cast doesn\u2019t run around in rage mode all the time (except Bakugo, but he\u2019s... unique).\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is decent, granted not Trigger\u2019s best, but sufficient for conveying the jagged atmosphere of a robot-versus-giant-monster scenario. And the music, while sparse, matches the understated feel of the characters well. \\n\\n\r\nSo, it\u2019s a mecha/kaiju anime with a different slant that pays homage to its roots. It\u2019s not Gundam, it\u2019s not Code Geass, heck, it\u2019s not even the original Gridman. There\u2019s plenty of shows out there like those but there\u2019s not many anime that feel like SSSS.Gridman. But I\u2019m glad there\u2019s at least one =)",

            "content": "TL;DR at the bottom. \r\nCharacters 2/10:\r\nMain Character has red hair and he is \"special\". He is your everyday high-schooler with nothing that stands out about him. You could replace him with any generic main character from any anime and it won't change a thing.\r\nThe main girl \"Rikka\" comes off as bored, uninterested and fed-up, all the time. She is sighing constantly and has no expressions. \r\nMay be she is supposed to reflect the audience response while watching this anime. \r\nOnly good thing about her is her character design, which is pretty good. \r\nMC has a generic supportive sidekick. But he is only there to befriend-zoned and not threaten the MC's chances with the girl.\\n\r\nRest of supporting cast is also pretty ordinary. \\n\\n\r\nStory 2/10:\\n\r\nA giant robot shows up and wrecks the city. MC fights the enemy with his own robot. MC wins. Next day everything resets to normal. \\n\r\nRinse. Repeat\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound 6/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10:\\n\r\nIt is good. Most of the attention has been given to character of \"Rikka\" to make her look good.

Feels like they are trying to use less frames per second to save money.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 3/10:\\n\r\nIf you have watched more than a few good anime, you won't find it particularly enjoyable.\\n\r\nUnless Mecha anime is your guilty pleasure.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMost People who like this anime have 1 reason only. That is the design of character \"Rikka\". She has become somewhat of a meme for her \"THICC THIGHS\". (Although I disagree that her thighs could be classified as thicc.

            "content": "Anime \ud83d\udc4f Review \ud83d\udc4f \r\nFirst of all, I don't think Gridman is underrated. As I was watching Guriddoman I felt a sense of emptiness in the show and I started wondering about what others thought about this show. So I thought I would write my honest review of this show.\r\nStory: The story revolves around this yung redhead lad who has amnesia. This dude goes on trip and talks to a computer and they fight together against Godzillas. This is simplified episode synopsis for the initial 5 episodes. This made it feel like I was watching some pokemon episodes where main characters are doing their thinguntil obnoxious antagonist arrives and the protagonist defeats em. It felt like watching same episode over and over again. What was able to keep me watching was big bob the builder (referring to boobs) girl and the dark gurren lagann looking thing. The plot never had anything else interesting in it to keep me hooked for the first 4 episodes. In general Gridman felt like I was watching some lame ass mecha PG-7 anime for children(minus the parts where Akane ordered to kill someone). \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: We have a MC with amnesia. This is a good start since it fucking destroys his whole personality(not like there was any in the beginning because of amnesia). We have MC's friend who doesn't neither show almost any personality aside from drooling for Akane (big bob girl). Main heroine is a tsundere bait that in reality just doesn't give a fuck. She doesn't show much of emotions aside from time to time some cute behavior so that she doesn't seem like to be just dead inside (She also learns to smile towards the end). Then we have team Gridman support group. This consist some forgettable characters and their only reason is to be Gridman's augementations. So the cast is Optimus Prime's sonic wing and super mode (Transformers: Cybertron), Gurren Lagann drill mode and sword mode (couldn't think any reference but sword is pretty generic). Not too original. To me only interesting characters are the antagonists Akane and Alexis echo. Akane's motives are lacking so Alexis is probably controlling her for it's own purpose.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation: I won't tackle on this too hard but the fighting animations are orgasmic and on par with Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. High Quality CG.\\n\\n\r\nSounds: Musics are good too but nothing ground breaking. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and conclusion: I cant really enjoy anything in this show except \\n\r\nfor animation and sounds. It's just overall a mediocre mecha anime in my opinion.  Be sure to give me some (constructive) criticism if you feel like it, I would really appreciate it.",

            "content": "You\u2019ll have to excuse the history lesson, but for those of you who don\u2019t know, the Tokusatsu (\u7279\u64ae) Genre, more commonly known as \u201ctoku\u201d, is the East Asian cultural description for science fiction TV and film that utilizes a certain brand of special effects to bring super-powered and/or overlarge action set pieces to life, which are usually in service of monstrous kaiju (\u602a\u7363). While much of this culture has remained fairly regional, some immensely popular exceptions including but not limited to Godzilla, Ultraman, and Kamen Rider have become somewhat iconic on an international scale, even including some western productions like King Kong and Pacific Rim.If any of those examples rung any bells for you, then you already know what to expect from SSSS.Gridman. It\u2019s good old Monster of the Week style storytelling with kaiju fighting giant mechas in bombastically destructive action sequences. That said, being a characteristically original and unique story as expected from Studio Trigger, SSSS.Gridman has far more intrigue and character than the basic toku formula could even begin to offer and uses the genre\u2019s inherent simplicity as a solid foundation to craft their own masterwork.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll begin discussion with the only aspect of the show that I could\u2019ve and honestly should\u2019ve had a problem with, which just happens to be the main character, Yuta Hibiki. My potential problem with Yuta, for there was really only one issue, is the fact that Yuta had amnesia at the start of the story, which is a trope that I hate to death (nor do I know a single person who likes it either.) Luckily, this is Trigger. This is a show with more love, creativity, and passion behind it than you could ever begin to imagine, so it\u2019s not like Yuta had amnesia just to be a self-inset MC or something, it\u2019s for plot reasons, but even with that defense it doesn\u2019t even matter because they still forged pure gold with it. You see, while Yuta has lost all of his memories, he still has his emotions, which makes him a breeze to characterize and empathize with right out of the gate. It\u2019s just like Trigger to take one of the most trite and overused tropes in the book, make the simplest yet most fresh alteration, and walk away with their own original treasure trove. Yuta aside, the other characters are totally flawless in their own right. Forget all the loud, obnoxious, autistic anime dialogue you\u2019re presented with by all the other seasonal garbage your watching as SSSS.Gridman and it\u2019s small, focused, highly developed main cast presents you with the exact same humanity, realism, and complexity you\u2019d expect from Trigger and their past roots in Gainax. Akane, Rikka, and Utsumi who make up the remaining main character cast are extremely multilayered, flawed, and human characters reminiscent of the cast of Neon Genesis Evangelion. The dialogue is turned down to a minimum, and the strong direction and passionately drawn facial animation brings the characters to life without them having to scream about their emotions for an entire episode like you\u2019d get from any other show. It\u2019s quiet, emotional, tonal, and contemplative, allowing you to sit down with the characters, look at them in their beautiful detailed eyes, and really get to know them as if they were people, you know?\\n\\n\r\n\u2026AND THEN THE ACTION KICKS IN AND GRINDS YOUR BRAIN THROUGH A FUCKING CHEESE GRATER!!!\\n\\n\r\nAkira Amemiya, the director of SSSS.Gridman and living legend Hiroyuki Imaishi\u2019s up-and-coming prot\u00e9g\u00e9, is a fanboy of Trigger, Gainax, and mecha anime just like you and I, and boy does it show or what!?! He knew exactly how to give the fans precisely what kind of action spectacle they wanted because he is a fan too. The action direction is epic as hell, using no shortage of extrapolated perspective shots, panoramic cinematography, sweeping angels, and even grounded perspective shots to show you just how monstrous and utterly enormous the fighting mechas and kaiju really are. CG animation is employed expertly to mercilessly rip an entire city to shreds right before your eyes and then throw whole buildings in your face, to have flawlessly detailed models of mechas and kaiju alike thrown across the screen and back again four times per second, and to show ginormous mechanical limbs scrape dozens of cars up across the street only to immediately send them soaring through the air and smashing into hellish fireballs as they hit their equally destructive and killer targets. On top of the pristine CG work, the absolute gods animating this show hand drew almost all of the static-framing shots and transformation sequences that show Gridman being as legendary as The Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann himself. Jesus, it\u2019s so awesome! I could go on for hours, but if you\u2019re at all missing Hiroyuki Imaishi\u2019s bombastic action hurricanes like Kill la Kill or Gurren Lagann, or Kazuya Tsurumaki\u2019s iconic environment breaking pan-out shots of the single most unforgettable action genre staples such as FLCL or Diebuster, then you absolutely MUST watch SSSS.Gridman because it brought it all back and more! \\n\\n\r\nThe amount of sheer love and inspiration that clearly brought this show to life shines through every single frame of it\u2019s display. Densely drawn artwork, poppy personable character animation, naturalistic character driven dialogue, and highly imagined direction are all there as Trigger is known for, but in addition to all that Amemiya\u2019s fresh directing style adds so many more all-new layers that have yet to take part in Trigger\u2019s crazy genius formula. If a character gets mad, for example, then Amemiya will bring in this weird semi-horror direction that makes the scene almost thrilling. There\u2019s so many occasions that the framing angles, the lighting effects, the zoom effects, or the color palette will do this interesting little shift that makes the scene feel so refreshing and inspired. Sometimes it\u2019s weirdness is a bit much, but, personally, I\u2019d rather watch a show which fails to fit the mold due to its uncontainable creativity and innovation, like SSSS.Gridman, than watch a show which fails to fit the mold due to its sheer incompetence, like basically everything else currently airing.\\n\\n\r\nDo you know why FLCL had a totally random South Park style episode? \\n\r\nIt\u2019s because Kazuya Tsurumaki and his team at Gainax had been watching South Park in the office and thought it\u2019d be a funny meme to put in the show. \\n\r\nDo you know why the Inferno Cop anime got made? \\n\r\nIt\u2019s because Hiroyuki Imaishi and his team at Trigger were jokingly dared by their fans on Twitter to make it after episode eleven of Space Patrol Luluco came out. \\n\r\nDo you know why Ragyo Kiryuin\u2019s hair was always framed to make her glowing hair look like horns? \\n\r\nIt\u2019s because Kazuki Nakashima had recently read the original Devilman manga and told the Trigger character designers to have her look \u201cdemonic in nature.\u201d \\n\r\nDo you know why Akko was accepted into Luna Nova Academy even though she couldn\u2019t use magic properly?\\n\r\nIt\u2019s because You Yoshinari was accepted into the anime industry before he could animate key frames, and he wanted his protagonist to be relatable.\\n\\n\r\nAll of these examples are able to be made because this line of creators are known for their involvement in the fandom, the fact that they actually care about the story they\u2019re telling, and they\u2019re equally impassioned about the way they go about telling them. Akira Amemiya has proven himself to be no exception. He\u2019s lived up to his successors and I couldn\u2019t possibly be more excited to see his future works with Trigger, because SSSS.Gridman was just as much of a loved and cared for passion-project as any other Trigger or Gainax show ever was! I was skeptical after suffering though A-1 Pictures in the FranXX, but this new team truly was able to bring Trigger\u2019s genuine style and imagination without their established legendary creators holding the reins. \\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading.",

            "content": "After 25 years since the original Gridman TV series debuted in 1993, Studio Trigger and Tsuburaya Productions, the company behind Gridman and Ultraman, have collaborated to produce the magnificent tokusatsu inspired reboot SSSS.Gridman. For those who are new to Gridman and tokusatsu entertainment, it is the Japanese term attached to any sci-fi/fantasy live-action series that uses an abundance of special effects. More specifically, practical effects; think people wrestling in rubber monster suits smashing through model cities and stop motion animation.\r\nThat leads us to SSSS.Gridman, the love child of first-time director Akira Amemiya and Keiichi Hasegawa, famed screenwriter of the 1990s Ultraman. It is overflowing withreferences and callbacks to the live-action series, SSSS is a lovingly crafted modernized take on the original series. The new story takes a theme relevant to today\u2019s audiences and focuses on the youth of Japan and their relationship to technology. \\n\\n\r\nThe show opens on Yuta Hibiki, an amnesiac first-year in high school who\u2019s just woken up in the home of Rikka Takarada, a girl in his class. With no clue who she is, or who he is for that matter. His standard introduction no doubt had people rolling their eyes, including me, and it does detract from the story, at least until we learn why he lost his memory. Yuta sees hallucinations of a robot named Gridman in an old computer in Takarada's family store, later called \u2018Junk\u2019 in reference to its name in the original show. Afterward, he meets Sho Utsumi, his friend before getting amnesia. Sho helps him with his memory loss, which is more or less his role in the series, being Yuta's support. He's a decent character, with a minor arc and some development. Throughout the first episode, the information we\u2019re being fed by the characters is incongruous with what we observe from Yuta\u2019s perspective. Rikka and Utsumi easily accept Yuta\u2019s amnesia and when he sees Kaiju looming in the distance they assume he\u2019s joking because\u2014like his Gridman hallucinations\u2014he is the only one who can see them at first. In spite of the mundane reactions of people around Yuta, the directing of nearly every scene communicates dread. It constantly feels like danger is just off the frame and the next scene will change everything.\\n\\n\r\nAmemiya lingers on long shots too long for them to feel normal, instead, they communicate anxiety, you constantly are waiting for something to happen that will break the mundanity. Lighting is oversaturated during the daytimes to convey the crushing heat of the summer, and at night is subdued with fog and the monsters are constantly shown looming in the distance over the heroes. In the first episode, a radio playing is placed in between scenes to shift the tone. It bears so much similarity to Neon Genesis Evangelion, it's unsurprising the director is a Gainax veteran. No doubt, SSSS.Gridman's greatest strength is the tone, it balances the mundane life of high school students with the dread of a Kaiju attack. Eventually, when the Kaiju do attack, it is equally satisfying to watch play out. The three main characters are together in Rikka\u2019s family store when the first Kaiju begins wreaking havoc on the city, forcing Yuta to work with Gridman fight off the monsters in giant robot form. Together they create the Gridman Alliance, dedicated to defeating any Kaiju that threatens their city.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation is fluid, characters are incredibly expressive, storyboards are filled with detail, shots are excellently framed. The camera work is dynamic making the action always exciting and even the CGI used during many of the fight scenes is superb. The sound design is especially amazing at giving audio feedback during these scenes, a vehicle being crushed, the ground crumbling under a monster, and all of the attacks sound so visceral and lifelike. From time to time the show's incredible opening is used as background music in fights, and this would typically grow tiresome but because the song is so good and relevant to the story it never bothered me. At times the monster's movements look janky, but it never feels unintentional, watching old tokusatsu series shows that this is how the monster/giant robot fights looked, they move in ways that make it seem as though someone is inside a suit navigating them. 2D animation could never have achieved the authenticity of the monsters they were aiming for here. Not every scene is exploding with action, but even when the pace slows down, the directing and intruiging storyboarding are still visually arresting. One qualm I would bring up is the overabundance of fanservice placed at awkward moments, this thankfully only happened in certain episodes around the midpoint of the show. All around, this show is incredibly faithful to the original series, visually, audibly, and narratively.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is at times too standard to the genre and could have used more originality rather than reliance on the source material. It delivers it's story beats confidently and plenty self-aware of the nostalgia it's evoking, but the times it updates the script to a modern audience are worthwhile. Important information is shown to us rather than told, a characters motivation is never told to us before it is shown, a twist never comes that wasn\u2019t foreshadowed heavily. This showing rather than telling comes across the most in Akane Shinjou's scenes, a classmate of Yuta\u2019s. She offers the most exciting writing in the show. In the first episode alone, her scenes convey more fear than any of the Kaiju scenes. She\u2019s subtle with her dark side and when she gets her quiet moments of angry reflection you get to see how bitter she is. Her psychotic tendencies and lack of care for others are made all the more frightening by how much power she proves to have.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough Yuta's simplistic personality is explained very well in the narrative, Rikka and Akane get far more development than him. Eventually, they even take his place as the protagonists, and the show is much better for it. Rikka gets more development than Yuta and becomes a remarkably sympathetic character right away. While Yuta and Utsumi celebrate their victories against Kaiju she worries about the fallout of the city being attacked and if her friends are safe. She's the most nuanced character in the show, and it often feels like she is a normal person who was placed into the plot of a wild sci-fi kids show. Her apprehension towards conflict and her contemplation of the effects of what's occurring in the story are what makes her so believable. Yuta and Utsumi are at first, ecstatic to escape the mundane life of being a student, then the shock of the danger they\u2019re in forces them to face reality and change their mindsets. Whereas Yuta accepts he has to overcome challenges at face value and follows through like a typical protagonist, Rikka is constantly questioning why she\u2019s in such a dire situation and where her place is in all of it. Her development throughout the show is intertwined with Akane's and they both change in ways that are very engaging to watch play out. \\n\\n\r\nThe themes of Gridman are showcased throughout the story in the elaborate technology the villain has, all alone in her room, contrasted with the beat-up old computer the Gridman Alliance use. Yet even with basic technology, they prove to be formidable foes to the Kaiju, and they enjoy working together. What the screenwriter is trying to say is rather basic, but it\u2019s nonetheless a well-reinforced theme and consistent throughout the show, you don\u2019t need an abundance of technology to have good relationships and valued friendships. \\n\\n\r\n[Final Score: 8/10]\\n\r\nSSSS.Gridman stands as one of the best mecha in recent memory. Stylistically it is much different than the rest of Studio Trigger's anime, but it is one of their greatest works yet. It wears its love for the original series and tokusatsu entertainment on its sleeve. The story is wonderfully nostalgic, and surprisingly enough, thought-provoking. Laden with subtle details building up to every twist, every theme, it is both visually interesting and endlessly analyzable. I look forward to rewatching it time and time again in the future.",

            "content": "This show is so under-rated. I don't know how it's rating is so low on MyAnimeList. Big shotout to PhenomSage for recommending.\r\nIt proves that you really can't judge a book by its cover, or review on MAL.\r\nSo to start off, a lot of you will probably look at this anime and think: \"Ew, its UltraMan animated\". This is for kids... Next. \r\nBut not so fast, while this anime does borrow a lot of inspiration from UltraMan, it is in a differnt league. The story is very fresh and creative, with it's own spin on the UltraMan genre that is obviously intented for a more matureaudience. The closest anime I can think of is Madoka Magica and its adoptation of the SaliorMoon genre. \\n\\n\r\nThe story started off awesomely and is getting more and more interesting every episode. You just need to watch it without any prejudice. Yes, it's about a boy who transforms into an UltraMan-like hero and fights monsters, but this is only a cover-up for a deeper underlying story. There's is clearly some dark mystery going on in the background, but the story doesn't draw more attention to it than it needs to. \\n\\n\r\nI need to applaud the storytelling so far, it's so on-point with its humour, pace, and suspense. The characters are also very interesting and beautifully created. They are super relatable and realistic. They are never oblivious to their situation and stalls out the story. Instead, they are the key driving force of the plot. The whole \"battling monsters\" acts as more of a background entertainment, which can be pretty nostalgic for those of us growing up watching UltraMan. The art is amazing! Top-tier along side animes like Code Geass and Macross Frontier. Music is awesome too! You can tell the creators are putting a lot of thought and efforts into this. \\n\\n\r\nBut seriously, you've got to watch it to believe it. I don't want to spoil anything. And trust me, you won't regret it.",

            "content": "Warning: spoilers and sarcasm are featured below\r\nHey, are you feeling down because you have this great idea for an anime but keep getting rejected by every studio that you try to sell your pitch to? Well it's time to turn that frown upside down, because Studio Trigger will gladly produce your anime for you, as long as your anime contains a few specific things of course. Here are the three easy steps that you must follow in order to have your anime green lit by Studio Trigger!\r\n1. Make sure to have a LOT of steamy hot fan service. It's best if your main source ofsex appeal comes from your leading female character, because being hot waifu material > having a personality and depth.\\n\\n\r\n2. Have your main character (who has to be an edgy teen btw) fly around in a giant mecha all the time because BIG ROBOTS ARE AWESOME!!!\\n\\n\r\n3. ADD ALIENS! Especially as twist villains for the final arc of your story, because there's nothing better than kids in giant robots fighting against aliens in FREAKING SPACE!!!\\n\\n\r\nFollow these simple steps and your anime will be practically guaranteed to end up as Trigger's next unsuccessful imitation of great anime like NGE and TTGL just like SSSS.Gridman is!\\n\\n\r\n...On second thought, maybe you should just try your luck with a no-name studio.\\n\\n\r\nI'm starting to think that creativity died at Studio Trigger. Yet although they seem to consistently recycle the same exact ideas, I've still enjoyed their works. I loved Kill la Kill because it somewhat deviated from the traditional Trigger formula and was just a great and fun anime all around. I even really liked Darling in the FranXX up until they butchered the ending because Trigger just HAD to have aliens. But with StopSoundingSoStupid.Gridman (Seriously, are the four S's supposed to mean something?), it just felt hollow. I never got the impression that this anime was trying to stand out and make a name for itself, and it unfortunately ended up being painfully average because of it.\\n\\n\r\nInterestingly enough, my score for this anime fluctuated several times throughout its run time. I actually did find some episodes to be enjoyable and even thought provoking, yet others were the embodiment of mediocrity equipped with bad character interactions and bland scenarios. The only things that remained consistent throughout were Rikka's sexy legs. But even those thick thighs weren't enough to salvage the dysfunctional plotline of this anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe setting is quite bizarre. Our protagonist has come down with a rather unfortunate case of amnesia that is poorly explained near the end of the anime and finds himself in a city surrounded by a bunch of giant kaiju that only he can see. But he doesn't really seem too concerned about any of this. In fact, he doesn't seem to care about anything at all except for getting in Rikka's pants. And when other characters finally realize that our hero Yuuta isn't insane and see the kaiju too, they also don't seem to care too much about their situation. And that's one of the glaring issues with this anime. If the characters are completely nonchalant about basically everything, then why should we the viewers care about what's going on? Not that the story itself is anything exciting. It's just a typical monster of the week that Gridman and Yuuta beat up and then everything resets (the damage to the city and the memories of everyone who isn't an important character) because plot. And despite what you may be thinking, there really isn't much more to this anime than that. If anything, it just became even more confusing and convoluted by the end of the show.\\n\\n\r\nFor the most part, the characters are pretty stale. Gridman is the most bland sentient robot ever conceived and is piloted by the most uninspired kid imaginable. Utsumi is that typical freind guy who never does anything useful except crack a joke or two every ten minutes. Rikka is the attractive female lead who's personality unfortunately isn't as good as her looks. Alexis is some random alien that's randomly in this anime because Trigger has an alien fetish. The other characters bar one aren't even worth mentioning.\\n\\n\r\n*This short segment contains spoilers as well as positive thoughts on this anime*\\n\\n\r\nThe one person who keeps this anime from falling below average in my eyes would be Akane. She takes the role of the antagonist, making all of the kaiju herself and trying to kill Gridman and people she doesn't like with them, and the anime literally revolves around her since she is, you know, a god. She seems like a fun and energetic girl at first, but after peeling away her mask, her true colors as a heartless, attention seeking psycho are exposed. And the anime even further sheds light on her intricate and delicate psyche later on in the show. The dream sequence episode, while weird, was one of my favorites from the anime simply because of how it portrayed Akane. She's just a really engaging character who I enjoyed watching. Her body is also pretty hot, I'd say even more so than Rikka's (Yeah, I said it). Akane is definitely the highlight of SSSS.Gridman for me.\\n\\n\r\n*End of spoilers and positivity*\\n\\n\r\nDespite my obvious displeasure with a decent chunk of this anime, it was still semi enjoyable to watch. Sure, the anime doesn't have much heart, but watching a giant robot beat up giant monsters is always fun, despite how repetitive it gets. And Rikka and Akane were a pleasure to watch (for more reasons than one~), so that's always a plus.\\n\\n\r\nShow'sStorySeriouslySucks.Gridman is underwhelming. It never really went anywhere and just felt sort of pointless. A lot of things didn't make sense and when the anime did try to explain something, it usually just made it even more confusing. Let's hope that Studio Trigger is able to improve with their next project.\\n\\n\r\nAnd hopefully not include any aliens.",

            "content": "SSSesth Gridman is the newest name monster from the studio everyone knows and which creativity after Inferno Cop has been entirely limited to their ability to make up shitty names that don't mean anything. eSeSeSeS. Gridman's biggest achievement is confirming that the future won't be changing this to any direction, especially not for better.\r\nStory:\r\nDude who has red hair starts hearing his computer talking to him and claiming he is this thing called Gridman while girl who he has never seen before in his life is now living with him or something. Then they start arguing over if the pc really talked. Less than half wayinto episode 1 and I was already confident that this is going to be a veeery long show despite its 1-cour length. \\n\\n\r\nRest of the writing centers around student life, chats about sandwiches, monster of the week epicness, reveals regarding the daily life of our cast, some mystery elements that are mysterious because they don't make any sense, mecha fights and new things that matter even less than the events before them. Also aliens with swords and yu-gi-oh arm bands, because more > less, apparently. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\\n\r\nDid I mention the dude has red hair? Well, that's not exactly important, but I just can't figure out what else there supposed to be to him. He also suffers from a memory loss which is the single worst trope invented by man, which is great because that's exactly the type of lame shit this show deserves.\\n\\n\r\nRikka is the best girl because she sighs every 3 seconds and sounds both disinterested and bored, which is also great because I imagine she has become self-aware and has realized she is a character in this fucking thing. *sigh* \"this out of all anime\" \\n\\n\r\nThere are also other characters here. One of them stares at the sky and it looks like she is finding it very fascinating, she is also insane or mentally ill / both. Another has glasses so that's kinda cool, always need that one motherfucker who can't see shit. I would love to mock all of these characters for more meaningful and less shallow reasons, but they are shells whose presence is entirely limited to their character models. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nGliddoman's animation consists of completely still background images, extremely slow tempo walking scenes and character interaction / dialog moments where the character animation is like 2 frames-per-second and there is no in-between animation at all: what we see is teleportation without any continuity. I have personally never seen anything like this in my life, but I am sure they managed to execute the whole thing with 70% less animators than is normally required, so if we are looking into pros: very few people have been required to waste their time working with this awful piece of anime. Kudos.\\n\\n\r\nThe monster design is great. The first thing that appears is basically oversized, pink colored Donatello who has a dragon head in the place of a navel. Which is amazing since its shell is so full of spikes it well get stuck on any surface it lays on its back and if it falls on its stomach, its neck will break. This is pretty much why I am finding this show to be worth of watching, I have had a blast imaging this fking thing yelling \"I am invincible!\" then tripping over and never moving again. Its movements are even better. Waddles from side to side and occasionally looks like a passable, decent quality slide show....\\n\\n\r\nSounds:\\n\\n\r\nWhy would anyone even want music amirite. It's so much more pleasant to listen teenagers acting like they are surprised. I can't figure out if this is really supposed to be voice acting or a parody of the seiyuu industry. Dude sees a Gozilla in the sky and gets almost as excited about it as a house wife who is ironing her husband's socks. \"Oh wow, this shit's great.\" Except that's the first time he ever sees one. Or maybe not because he suffers from memory loss. On the other hand, I care way too little to consider more possibilities. \\n\\n\r\nAlso I kinda lied. There are songs, but they mainly exist in action scenes and don't work very well. First one lasted like 15 seconds and was terrible trailer-music-tier stuff but lacking anything that makes them good. The second lasted approximately 4 seconds and I am still uncertain if it was really a song or the sound of a siren just before its battery runs dry. The third song was an anime opening you hear typically in seasonal slice of life shows except here it was inserted in the middle of an action sequence and its vocals were more visible than the action itself. I am not sure why anyone would want to make something like this or think this is a good idea, but whatever, since everything else is already terrible, why not make the sounds awful, too, I guess.  \\n\\n\r\nConclusions:\\n\\n\r\nSSS Gridman Sucks. The last S. is really supposed to be moved at the end of the sentence, hence the dot in title. Thanks Triggarh",

            "content": "When SSSS.Gridman first began, people really didn\u2019t like it. I think a lot of the surface-level elements turned people away, especially since the first few episodes were fairly slow and predictable. But once the show actually got going, the actual content there kept us coming back week after week, and it ended up being not just one of my favorite shows of its season, but of the year as a whole.\r\n\tGridman is a precarious mix of genres, balancing seemingly everyday school life against giant mecha fights. The former goes against what people expect from mecha anime, and is likely responsible for the show being labeledas slow. However, these two disparate halves somehow built off each other, with the tension of the daily life feeding into the catharsis of the action scenes. Since it's the more mundane material that seems to have garnered the most criticism, that'll be the focus of this review.\\n\\n\r\n\tInterestingly enough, this means I really don\u2019t need to talk about Yuta. While he may pilot Gridman, his amnesiac protagonist bit gets in the way of him having a particularly interesting school life, and instead Rikka steps forward as the protagonist. Rikka is the more emotionally-driven of the two, and while she\u2019s aware of all the kaiju shenanigans going on in the show, it\u2019s never really her main drive.\\n\\n\r\n\tInstead, Rikka\u2019s conflict is her trying to reconnect with Akane, the antagonist of the series with whom she used to be close friends. Akane creates the kaiju that terrorize the city, and it would be so easy to just view her as the villain, especially since this is how she presents herself. But unlike the other protagonists, Rikka doesn't look at her through this lens. By refusing to play on Akane\u2019s terms of mecha and kaiju, she is the one who is able to genuinely reach out to Akane and save her from her isolation. This story of reconnection could have been treated as secondary to the main action, but instead it\u2019s given the same level of attention, receiving much of the show\u2019s expressive animation and relatable character moments.\\n\\n\r\n\tAlso, the show absolutely nails atmosphere. Though everything seems mostly normal for the first half of the run, the show's use of its claustrophobic camera and tendency for long pauses serve to constantly instill a sense of discomfort in the viewer as they try to figure out why the world seems off. The summer heat is tangible and oppressive, and the rainy days are all the more miserable. The soundtrack goes a long way to sell these scenes, and the opening and ending are both fantastic.\\n\\n\r\n\tBriefly, I\u2019ll talk about how the show handles homage. I think a lot of the criticism leveled at the show is based on it being too steeped in references to other shows, to the point that animator for the original Gridman Obari Masami complained that they weren\u2019t doing anything new with the material. With that said, I don\u2019t mind having these callbacks as fanservice to fans of the original, especially since they don\u2019t conflict with the story being told. Plus, how upset can I really be over all of the character designs being based on obscure Transformers? That\u2019s adorable.\\n\\n\r\n\tIn conclusion, Gridman is just really good, you know? If you\u2019ve been on the fence about watching Gridman because of the initial negative reception, I'd say it's worth trying for yourself. I'm still not entirely clear why so much of the community is down on this show, but I absolutely loved it, and I hope that more people will give it a chance.",

Kaiju comes, transform into Gridman, and done. Rinse and repeat pretty much. They might add a bit more \"drama\" to the mix but the formula wouldn't change since it's so simple. I'm not saying \"simple\" is also bad, anime such anime \"Yuru Camp\" is so simple but so satisfyingto watch because the characters make up for it. I see a lot of people be like Rikka is different or something about her is special. What in the hell are you even looking at?

            "content": "SSSS.Gridman is an anime inspired by the old tokusatsu series Denkou Choujin Gridman. It takes what's interesting about the genre and adjusts it to fit the modern day's standards. Thanks to that the final product turned out to be an interesting mix of old and new. Add to it the outstandingly good execution and you get a masterpiece that can keep you glued to the screen with every episode.\r\nThe main character of the anime is Yuuta Hibiki - a high school boy that wakes up at Rikka Takarada's home having no memories at all. At the Junk Shop, which belongs to Rikka's family, there's anold computer called Junk. And inside of it there's Gridman - the Hyper Agent telling Yuuta there's a mission he needs to fulfill. Yuuta lets his school friend Utsumi in on what's happened and when huge monsters called kaijuu start attacking the city, these three form the Gridman Alliance and with the help of the robot inside Junk, they start fighting said monsters and begin the journey to discover the truth about the city and everyone in it.\\n\\n\r\nSince the very beginning there's a feeling that there's more to the show than it might appear at first. In what could be labelled as a naive show targetting the younger audience there's always the feeling that something is off and with every episode the eerie atmosphere becomes more apparent, which only makes the experience better. I loved the mysterious atmosphere of the weird, closed off city and the scenery filled with giant dormant monsters reminding you that even the calm days aren't how they should be.\\n\\n\r\nWhat adds to the atmosphere is the background music, or rather the frequent lack thereof. Because of that (and of the animation) some scenes look pretty slow, but I wouldn't call it a bad thing in this particular case. The music does always appear during the fight scenes, though, and it's fitting and good. I also liked both the opening and ending song. There's a song I liked even more, though, and namely Yume no Hero - the original Gridman's opening song - which the original version of we can hear in the last episode and there was also a rearrangement of it played before. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the fights, what's much more outstanding about them than the soundtrack are the visuals. The fight scenes are super good and in my opinion they only get better with every episode. The CGI used during them looks clean and good quality and it also makes Gridman and the kaijuu look kind of heavy like they are supposed to be. We also get to see lots of cool transformations and gattai. Many cool combinations appeared throughout the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe visuals are great not only during the fight scenes. There are rather many still frames, but I perceive them as an artistic move, which I like. But when things are moving, the animation is fluid, especially when there's a lot of action going on. The backgrounds are full of details, the characters have nice designs (I also love their eyes) and there is nothing about the visual side of the show that I could complain about.\\n\\n\r\nI found the characters to be another really strong point of the anime. Our main trio is totally likeable. Although devoid of some super unique traits, they feel genuine and their actions are understandable. And that's exactly what I like about them. They are just a group of normal high school kids whose everyday life changes because of the strange events happening. One could complain about the main character being bland, but there's a reason behind that, and it's more than just the fact that he has no memories. There's also Akane Shinjou - the girl everyone loves and a friend of Rikka. The Neon Genesis Junior High Students are a crazy but lovable and useful bunch, whose eccentricity doesn't fail to make the viewers smile. There's also a certain kaijuu boy that grew on me over time. The supporting characters are also fine. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the references - there seem to be many of them, but as someone that has never been into tokusatsu shows, I can't say much about them, unfortunately. I feel like I'm missing out a bit, but it's not like being knowledgeable about this kind of thing is necessary to enjoy the show. I'm sure the references will add to the experience for people that are more familiar with that stuff, though. I also wanted to mention one thing I looked up before, and namely the background of a certain girl that played an important role in the episode 6. If you are interested in that, I recommend looking up a kaijuu named Anosillus. It's quite moving. Episode 6 is also the one the aforementioned rearrangement of the old opening song was played in.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum it up, I see SSSS.Gridman as a show made of love and care for details. In spite of it taking inspirations from other things, it feels like it has its own identity. The quality of the anime is super good. To me this show is one of a kind. Simple, yet interesting and satisfying. I found it to be extremely enjoyable and I highly recommend giving it a try!",

            "content": "(An Abridged Take Inside TRIGGER Studios)\r\nDirector [claps hands]: Okay. Thank you all for coming on such short notice. I just wanted to discuss some further details on the series that I thought appropriate.\r\n[Staff members nod their heads and grunt in agreement]\r\nDirector [smiling]: Great! Okay. Masaru [Sakamoto], you are in charge of the character designs, right?\r\nMasaru [nodding]: Yes, that is correct.\r\nDirector: Okay. May I see how they look so far?\r\n[Masaru nods and shows him a clipboard containing several designs of the main characters. The director takes his time glancing at each of the female designs.]\r\nDirector: Okay. I like what you have here, but I think wecan make both of these female characters stand out more.\\n\\n\r\nMasaru [intrigued]: Sure. What would you want to change about them?\\n\\n\r\nDirector [pointing at Rikka]: Okay. [leans towards Masaru\u2019s ear and whispers in a serious tone] I want dat ass big and her thighs thicc!\\n\\n\r\nMasaru [choking in absolute shock]: Uhh sir, I mean\u2026 are you sure about that?\\n\\n\r\nDirector [grabs Masaru by the collar]: Okay listen here bucko, I\u2019ve been in this industry for over a decade. I was an animator for one of the most successful anime from this year, Darling in the FranXX, so I think I know a thing or two about what sells in this business. [Releases his grip on Masaru and returns to a light-hearted tone] And try and make the other girl look cute, but not with thicc thighs. Only one girl gets that.\\n\\n\r\nMasaru [still stunned after what had just transpired]: Wh-what do you mean, \u201clook cute\u201d?\\n\\n\r\nDirector [walking away]: Just think what I would look like if I were a high school girl. Okay?\\n\\n\r\n[Masaru has no idea how to respond and decides to ask mechanical designer Shigeto Koyama on his opinion. Koyama sees the designs of both girls and a slick smile forms across his face.]\\n\\n\r\nShigeto [amused]: Well, when all else fails, you can always make dem titties big!\\n\\n\r\nMasaru: \u2026.\\n\\n\r\n(Inner Masaru [sighing]: What the hell did I sign up for?)\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________\\n\r\nRegardless of how seriously you take the transcript written above, it\u2019s hard to argue just how much attention to detail went into the creation of SSSS.Gridman. While being heavily inspired by the 1993 live-action series Gridman the Hyper Agent, this version is loaded with visual references to numerous tokusetsu series and mecha anime of the past \u2013 Space Runaway Ideon, Getter Robo, Evangelion, several iterations of Gundam and more receive stunning rendition scenes that serve as quick but effective throwbacks appealing to nostalgia for the die-hard fans of yesterday. Whilst on the other side of the community, Gridman had managed to conquer the ever-present \u201cbest girl\u201d debate of the season, with each week providing more material and support for why each girl and this series is worth one\u2019s attention. Hell, there was even a theory made halfway into Gridman about whether or not Rikka was secretly pregnant with the protagonist\u2019s child the entire time (there\u2019s actually a fair amount of evidence about it, not gonna lie.) But first impressions are usually not what they seem and this saying holds true for Gridman, as the very first episode comes off as anything but the fun mecha shows its constantly compared to.\\n\\n\r\nSSSS.Gridman introduces its audience with several long shots lasting for uncomfortable periods of time \u2013 focusing on rather mundane things like a pile of shoes and dozens of students leaving school for the day, with only the sounds of cicadas being heard. Our protagonist Yuta wakes up in an unfamiliar room, with an unfamiliar female sitting across from him. The unfamiliarity continues as shots continue having characters fail to dominate the frames they are in, often outsized by their environment; constrained into small spaces of scenes. And when characters are allowed to dominate frames, the camera often takes weird perspectives placed either above or below their eyelines, almost intimately close to these characters. There\u2019s a strong, distinct direction present that forces the viewer to rarely ever feel comfortable about what is being presented, coupled by a minimalist-style soundtrack that further emphasizes a quiet, environmental atmosphere rarely ever attributed with mecha shows. Its presentation is one that is more inclined to push anime fans away given just how different the show appears to contrast with the majority of anime airing nowadays. Some may call it a series with striking directing techniques that ultimately lacks proper direction. but I would urge otherwise as Gridman still has a lot of upside that helped make it one of the most popular shows of the season.\\n\\n\r\nThe story focuses on amnesiac Yuta Hibike, who after finding himself in the home of fellow classmate Rikka Takarada meets a robot known as Gridman inside of an old computer. This has coincided with a sudden appearance of giant unmoving Kaiji, with one abruptly attacking the city causing Yuta to merge with Gridman to battle the Kaiju. In the aftermath however, the city around them appears rebuilt, with those having died being forgotten and people\u2019s memories being reset around this fact, all bar the main characters. Because of this, Yuta attempts to stop the Kaiji from attacking and uncover the truth behind these disappearances. The mystique behind these events is what ultimately drives the story forward, however majority of the first half of Gridman almost rigidly follows a simple formula akin to tokusetsu monster-of-the-week: slight plot development occurs, monster appears, big hero/monster fight ensues with the heroes coming out on top, maybe some followup and repeat. This is not necessarily a detriment to the show as it works well to further establish most side characters and the setting in general, but once again it\u2019s a tool that can easily alienate more viewers looking to see why Gridman is so well-liked.\\n\\n\r\nGridman\u2019s cast may not be seriously complex in their characterization nor development but still remain a solid aspect of the series, especially with the chemistry between more characters. The way each of the high school students are able to bounce personalities off each other is impressive and the least someone like myself can ask for of characters barely important to the plot. Although there still are some specific characters worth mentioning: Yuta as an amnesiac portrays a relatable human response in trying to carry on as usual to the best of his ability, reflecting how many of us will often try and find a sense of normalcy, coping to the best of our abilities instead of shutting out entirely despite the desire of sometimes wanting to. Meanwhile on the other side of the spectrum, Akane serves as the main antagonist to Yuta and friends, spending most of her time inside her eerie room, creating Kaiji inspired from daily frustrations and petty grudges. Underneath her outward reputation as a talented student lies a psychologically twisted girl barely able to be kept contained. Thematically, the series dangles along threads of memory and connection and both of these characters are integral to these ideas.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as Gridman's production value is concerned, this is where the series really shows off its strengths. Distinct character designs and colour palette that never overwhelms a single scene, detailed backgrounds that give off an ominous sense of uncertainty, subtle edits to further keep the audience away from any settled feeling. Its animation is somewhat limited considering the number of stills used in Gridman but does utilize a significant amount of 3D animation in conjuction with 2D animation, and here is where opinions can get easily divisive. From the time of Gridman\u2019s airing, anime still has a long way to go with improving CG animation to looking anywhere near as appealing as traditional-style animation, and when both styles are used in the same show, the consensus thought is that it comes off clunky, immersion-breaking and overall detrimental to the show visually. But Gridman stands as an exception to this, with the CG-animated fights coming across more reminiscent to that of tokusetsu battles. In this way, these action scenes give off a similar sense of scale of larger-than-life monsters duking it out, destroying vehicles and buildings as if they were mere toys. These moments also encapsulate what I feel are the best parts of SSSS.Gridman.\\n\\n\r\nWhenever a Kaiju attacks and Gridman, the hero and giant ass-kicking robot enters the fray, everything regarding the purposeful directing fades out: the unsettling camera angles, the absence of music, the alienation \u2013 all of the uncanniness is annihilated for this moment courtesy of the triumphant emergence of the hero confronting the evil. All of the sudden the cameras move into action, the music blares out, frames are completely dominated by the two behemoths. It doesn\u2019t last very long but for this moment we as viewers finally are at ease and it becomes a glorious release of pent-up emotion. Expert manipulation of the audience that while it may sound simple on paper, could only work under the guise of splendid filmmaking ability. And that, is where SSSS.Gridman truly shines.\\n",

            "content": "SSSS.Gridman is a truly bizarre experience. After the monumentally disappointing Darling in the FranXX and the surprisingly worthwhile Planet With, this show completes the year\u2019s holy trinity of super robot anime by being a confusing mixed bag that is a nightmare to discuss. While it doesn\u2019t exactly go full Evangelion, there are still references to it as well as stylistic similarities between the two. However, there\u2019s more to this peculiar anime than just being another run-of-the-mill mecha series.\r\nFirst and foremost, this is both a tokusatsu and super robot anime. Sparing you the lengthy history of both concepts, it\u2019s clear that the trappings of the twogenres aren\u2019t easy to deal with in contemporary anime\u2014or any anime in the case of tokusatsu. Case in point: while reused animation is common in mecha series, they\u2019re mainly utilized for robot transformations and special attacks. However, SSSS.Gridman goes as far as to rewind even non-action scenes, creating unnecessary repetition. Studio Trigger also decided to render the Gridman and its Kaiju foes using CGI, and the jarring blend between these 3D models and their 2D environment causes a serious case of the uncanny valley. Not helping matters is how these hulking titans continually swap between 2D and 3D, making everything they interact with --i.e. the road, the cars, the debris, etc.-- become a visual disaster. It\u2019s a shame these graphical problems make the fights harder to follow given their cool choreography and sakuga moments.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style of this series is far from appealing. Aesthetically, the show is incredibly bland. The inconsistent animation can sometimes make the faces look like deformed potatoes, which are further accentuated by the uninspired character designs. The characters look incredibly plain apart from their vibrant eyes, and even the more appealing individuals such as Anti and Rikka seem lacking. Another problem is the awkward movements, specifically the hand and arm motions. Long story short, this show has a bunch of visual oddities that dampen the experience.\\n\\n\r\nIn spite of all the aforementioned problems, SSSS.Gridman has a striking direction. There are moments between fights that highlight a sense of discomfort and eerie quietness, similar to the atmospheric pauses in Evangelion. These scenes feel pretentious at times, but the clever framing of shots that illustrate the emotional distance of the characters makes them more engrossing than not. Film buffs might find this directing standard fare, but such a thing is noteworthy in the anime landscape. The dream sequences in episode nine are particularly fun to witness and showcase the creative talent of director Akira Amemiya.\\n\\n\r\nS^4 Gridman heavily restrains its usage of background music. Most non-action scenes lack an accompanying soundtrack. You would think the absence of music makes their purpose more meaningful, but sadly this isn\u2019t the case. Since the soundtracks aren\u2019t utilized frequently, none of them are memorable as a result. However, there is one track that stood out: the opening theme \u201cUnion\u201d by OxT. As an uplifting song, it works as a call to action that plays when the main cast is gaining the upper hand against their Kaiju opponents. The song doesn\u2019t always mesh properly with the sequence since it\u2019s sometimes too quiet, but when it does, be prepared for some epic moments. Sadly, all this can\u2019t be said for the forgettable ending theme.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of SSSS.Gridman is a mixed bag. For every character like Calibur, whose quirkiness comes from his silent, dorky attitude, we have someone boring like Yuta, our unremarkable protagonist. Most of the main characters, including the titular Gridman, are one-dimensional; the most interesting thing about them is their genuine interactions amongst each other. On the other hand, the three antagonists are highly fascinating. Akane is similar to a child trapped in her own sandbox video game world, twisted by her own influence, loneliness, and creations. One of these creations, Anti, is a foil to Gridman. He\u2019s an overly serious edgelord so hell-bent on destroying Gridman that he ends up being hilariously awkward in social interactions. He would even pick fights with other Kaiju simply because of his desire to personally kill Gridman. As for Alexis, his voice and demeanor make him seem incredibly humorous and lackadaisical -- even as he shoves a buzzsaw to someone\u2019s eye.\\n\\n\r\nOne irksome trait the cast share is their tendency to restrict themselves for no proper reason. For example, in episode three, Yuta, Calibur, and Gridman worry the others by disappearing after a Kaiju defeats them, only for them to be on standby the entire time. One could make the argument that rushing back into battle or retreating immediately would have tipped the Kaiju off, but they could have escaped after it left since they can just warp back to the shop. \\n\\n\r\nAll this segues perfectly into SSSS.Gridman\u2019s obscure narrative. The mystery surrounding the show\u2019s existentially horrifying world is unnerving in the sense that the narrative gradually becomes more destructive as secrets begin to unravel, a la FranXX. While I don\u2019t feel the show crosses that line enough to destroy any investment I could possibly have --at least until episode 10-- there\u2019s a fundamental aspect of the world-building that doesn\u2019t strike me the right way. \\n\\n\r\nTiptoeing around spoilers, one of the major gimmicks of this show's world is that everyone\u2019s memories of the dead are altered when a character dies at the hands of a Kaiju, or a Kaiju gets destroyed. With the exception of the surviving combatants, everyone\u2019s mind starts to become hazy. It\u2019s not quite on the level of Re:Zero where society begins to doubt the existence of certain individuals, but it\u2019s still a frustrating gimmick that doesn\u2019t entirely make sense. As such, the show\u2019s convoluted narrative makes it difficult to recommend. The asspulls in the second half only adds to this problem.\\n\\n\r\nDespite its various shortcomings, SSSS.Gridman is still an entertaining mecha anime. The fights are fun to watch, the banters between the characters are engaging, and the twisted hellhole of a world leaves viewers with much to ponder. Maybe I would have enjoyed this more if I\u2019m familiar with the tokusatsu genre, but I doubt such knowledge would make this show any less difficult to unpack. It\u2019s an enigmatic mixed bag that I am glad to have watched.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOh, and on top of the Eva references, this show makes a Gurren Lagann reference, so there\u2019s another link between the Gridman Planet With FranXX trio.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWritten/Edited by: CodeBlazeFate \\n\r\nProofread by: Peregrine and Skittles",

            "content": "SSSS.hit!\r\nIs Studio Trigger aware that they are not required to produce wack-ass anime ad infinitum?  It feels like they take pleasure in discovering new ways to SSSS.hit all over your computer screens, just to see how desperate we are for a new Mecha anime.  Perhaps the success of Inferno Cop went to their heads, giving them a false sense of entitlement to shove even worse rubbish up our collective SSSS.hit(holes), in hopes that we would gobble it up like a bunch of mindless, horny drones.  I can\u2019t blame a player for wanting to get paid, but I can certainly blame Studio Triggerfor wanting to get paid\u2026\u2026\u2026\\n\\n\r\n\u2026What?  Why are you staring at your screen like that?  Nothing to see here.\\n\\n\r\nSSSS.Gridman is an anime that utilizes a formulaic approach to present a vapid adventure about a young boy who merges with a Mecha to fight outlandish \u201cmonsters\u201d in a no holds barred, explosive battle to the death.  The fights, themselves, are  standard-fare.  Emulating the exaggerated absurdity of Gurren Lagann, but never quite reaching the eccentricity of Kill la Kill.  But while the former two attempted to stitch together (see what I did there? **Kill la Kill reference**) an acceptable narrative with their own, unique brand of action-comedy, SSSS.Gridman fails to capture the viewer\u2019s attention in any meaningful fashion.  Per the cyclical, episodic framework, each 23 minute offering utilizes a \u201crinse and repeat\u201d approach, where a new \u201cmonster\u201d/Kaiju enters the city only to be defeated by the Gridman and reset everyone\u2019s memories (except for those directly involved), as if the crisis never happened.\\n\\n\r\nBy virtue of being repetitious, Studio Trigger, once again, displayed a general lack of ambition and creativity, especially with the addition of a superfluous river rafting episode, to give the staff an excuse to animate the girls in scantily clad outfits.  Furthermore, SSSS.Gridman is not funny.  The entertainment is lackluster, at best.  The concepts and themes are tedious.  And dare I mention the plot?\u2026It\u2019s not like the staff cared to mention it in any detail.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the worst aspect of the show is the prosaic, uninspired characters.  None of  them say/do anything worth remembering, nor do they come off as likable or worth caring about.  Yuta is your typical \u201conly I can save the day\u201d protagonist, with a plain, \u201cnice guy\u201d demeanor and a distinct red hair color.  His rival, Akane Shinjou, is a cold, despondent female with a murderous rage that can only be quelled by generating new Kaiju to terrorize the city and anyone who has wronged her.  Why, you may ask: because she\u2019s a psychotic bitch (need I elaborate?).  Akane\u2019s manipulator, Alexis Kerib, is the show\u2019s token evil \u201calien,\u201d to guide events to their ultimate conclusion. Studio Trigger, much to my dismay, seems to excel at producing low quality characters that exude pure nothingness, except for some hackneyed quarks and superficial characteristics.\\n\\n\r\nThe only positive aspect about SSSS.Gridman is the OST, not that it was anything spectacular, but it accomplished its goal of being mildly entertaining.  But if we consider that an OP/ED are merely shallow, trivial components of what a show truly entails, then it\u2019s quite the condemnation to the substantive portions of the show in question.  \\n\\n\r\nWouldn\u2019t you agree?\u2026",

            "content": "I went into SSSS Gridman with high expectations because outside of me being big fan Gainax/Trigger I wanted to see if Trigger its wounds after they got drill blasted by Darling in the Franxx by A1/Cloverworks that left a nasty wound which needed a lot of time to recover from. I actually thought the series would go back it's Little Witch Academia/Kill la Kill days where it a nice blend of style and substance. However, after watching all 12 episodes of this show subbed and the first 8 episodes dubbed I can definitely say that this is not Trigger as it's best. In fact, thisis one of Trigger's weaker shows. I know you guys are thinking right now.\\n\\n\r\n> Trigger hasn't got a big library of anime.\\n\r\nWell if I had to personally rank every anime from Trigger, it would go as follows.\\n\\n\r\nBest.\\n\\n\r\nLittle Witch Academia (TV)\\n\\n\r\nLittle Witch Academia: The Enchanted Parade\\n\\n\r\nKill la Kill\\n\\n\r\nLittle Witch Academia OVA\\n\\n\r\nSpace Patrol \\n\\n\r\nInferno Cop\\n\\n\r\nWhen Supernatural Battles Became Common Place\\n\\n\r\nSSSS Gridman\\n\\n\r\nKiznaiver\\n\\n\r\nDarling in the Franxx\\n\\n\r\nWorst\\n\\n\r\nAs you can see here SSSS Girdman is in the bottom 3 meaning that the show was clearly not triggered at it's finest. In fact, I go as far that this is Trigger holding back as well playing it too safe, This is not to say that SSSS Girdman was a awful series as I thought it was a average to below average series however after watching the trailer for Promare you can easily tell that Trigger put more effort for Promare and as a result SSSS Girdman feels and functions like a side project that the B team for Trigger decided to work on this while the A team for Trigger went to work on Promare and it clearly shows from the plot, characters, and writing quality.\\n\\n\r\nStory.\\n\r\nThe story follows Yuuta Hibiki, who is an amnesiac first-year high school student living in the fictional Japanese city of Tsutsujidai. He soon meets the Hyper Agent Gridman in an old computer, who stated that the boy has a mission he must fulfil, as he sets out to find the meaning to those words and his memory loss. The sudden appearance of Kaiju would eventually change the usual dynamics of Yuuta and his classmates. Hibiki is able to merge with Gridman to fight kaiju, but after the kaiju attacks, people's memories are reset and those who die are forgotten. As the \"Gridman Alliance\", Hibiki and his friends now seek to stop the kaiju and uncover the truth behind the disappearances, with assistance from mysterious friends of Gridman that can transform into weapons Gridman can use in combat.\\n\\n\r\nThe word dull is honestly the best word to describe the story of SSSS Girdman. While it wasn't actually awful by any means it just so dull and at times uninteresting to follow. The series basically follows your classic monster of the week formula where set kaiju comes in to cause trouble in the city then they get defeated by Girdman and the series goes back to the status quo. Rinse and repeat.\\n\\n\r\nAlong with the show's monster/kaiju of the week formula, the series uses a certain plot device that I have grown to dislike over the years and that is Amnesia. If you don't know what Amnesia is then is basically a person who has no memory thanks to a certain event that caused him to lose memories and they essentially walking husks on screen until set character of set series gets they memory back. It is a plot device that essentially takes a big shit of the plot for set show as set show is literally forced to follow every amnesiac plot device possible and it's honestly tedious to watch.\\n\r\nSSSS Girdman is no different to this and as a result, the series was a chore to watch as we just see this our amnesia protagonist defeat Kanju left and right without a second thought.\\n\\n\r\nWhen the show finally stops being this generic monster of the week in the last couples the series is being a boring God story with our main antagonist Akame and surprise it's generic as hell just like the rest of this series. Honestly what the hell were you thinking Trigger!!!\\n\\n\r\nFinally, did a forget that Trigger was completely holding back when they did decide to make this show. I understand Trigger wanted to play itself after the disaster that was Franxx but unfortunately there is a huge difference between playing itself and simply holding back for no reason and it really shows.\\n\\n\r\nIf there was any silver lining to SSSS Girdman to speak of it was the show was simply a fun throwback to not only the mecha anime genre from the past but Tokusatsu genre as a whole. While I personally cannot get into the Tokusatsu genre, I will admit it genre has its appeal and anyone who is a fan of the Tokusatsu genre would probably have a good time with SSSS Girdman. It's such a shame the narrative isn't all that good to back it up.\\n\r\nOverall the story of SSSS Girdman was shallow that was plagued with cheap plot devices.\\n\r\n3/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\r\nThe characters in SSSS Girdman were easily the weakest part of SSSS Girdman. They aren't terrible but they don't stand out all that much outside of a certain character trait for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nYuuta is your typical mecha/high school boy shounen protagonist that we all have seen before. Thanks to his amnesia in the narrative, he has no real personality to speak off. He doesn't grow as a character all that much and just simply a bore to watch. Even more boring than Katsuhira from Kiznaver.\\n\r\nRikka started off as a decent character at first but my god did she devolved into boring ass meme as the series progresses where the only she had going for was her sexy thick tights.\\n\r\nShou is just there. He doesn't offer much to the story other to be a semi-useless sidekick for Yuuta.\\n\r\nThe only slightly decent main character in the show was Akane as she has a decent motivation of killing all the Girdman. I really enjoyed how after she had peeled her cute face as she turned into a proper psycho. She was the most entertaining thing about this subpar series.\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters were just as interesting as watching those dumb Channel Awesome anniversary specials on Youtube.\\n\r\nOverall the characters in SSSS Gridman were very dull.\\n\r\n4/10\\n\\n\r\nVisuals.\\n\r\nCompared to the unpolished Trigger+ Cloverworks that was Darling in the Franxx the visuals in SSSS were pretty appealing for the most part. The characters were very distant and pretty to look at thanks to the beautiful smooth colour palette that was used to colour each character, Kanj and Gridman mecha itself which was nicely designed. The background scenery was well drawn as it had a lot of detail.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was pretty solid for what it was however at the time it got a bit choppy in certain fights least it's not as bad as Franxx second half although the CGI itself could have been a lot better as it rather janky at times.\\n\r\n7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is alright for what it is but not that memorable.\\n\r\nThe opening and ending themes were decent but nothing too special.\\n\r\nAs for sub vs dub well, this was a tricky one because I only saw the last 2 episodes subbed as I mainly watched this show dubbed and it was great and it manages to surpass the sub which was already pretty good on its own. The voice actors really did an excellent job with the roles they were given as it was well acted and nicely directed.\\n\r\n6.5/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts.\\n\r\nWhy Trigger why do you do this to me...\\n\r\nI really wanted to like SSSS Girdman I really do, but the series was ultimately average at best and lacklustre at worst. The story was very bland that has a boring episodic narrative that was mixed with weak writing, The characters were as interesting as eating eggs with no salt as they all lack any personality to speak off other than memes and generic character traits. The only things that were good about this show were the visuals, soundtrack and the English dub everyone was mediocre at best. It was honestly sad that the way Trigger didn't put a lot of effort into this project as I feel they put more effort into the movie Promare which is set to release in 2019 while Trigger ended up giving this show to they B team and it clearly shows. This show would have been better off as a 6 episode OVA instead of a 12 episode mediocre Trigger feast that we ultimately got.\\n\r\nNow if I think about it I think this is Trigger second worst series that they made because least Kizaiver had some interesting elements things that made the series a somewhat decent watch despite its massive flaws. This show is nothing more but a love letter to the Tokusatsu genre and nothing else.\\n\r\nUnless you're into the Tokusatsu genre as well as LA HOT THICK TIGHTS MEMES XD I cannot recommend this show to people especially who are Trigger fans such as myself. \\n\r\nYou're honestly better watching Planet With or King of Braves series over this.\\n\\n\r\nBetter luck next time Trigger. \\n\r\nAlso for the love of God Trigger please do not screw up Promare I'm begging you.\\n\r\nFinal Score 5/10",

            "content": "Only a few months after releasing one of the most controversial anime of the year that caused a huge stir in the anime fandom, studio TRIGGER is back with, another one! Collaborating with Tsuburaya Productions, they bring to you, SSSS.Gridman. It pays homage to the original Gridman and the Superhuman Samurai Syber Squad series from the \u201990s. Also, the tokusatsu shows such as the Ultraman franchise and lastly, to good old Gainax. There are many otaku culture references throughout, mostly to do with Evangelion, especially the episodes that have the Anno Hideaki directing style and feel to it. This is an anime that is packedwith vexing mysteries, it puts forth a lot of interesting questions and conveys a wide variety of themes. If you fancy the \u2018more about the journey than the destination\u2019 type of stories than this one is for you.\\n\\n\r\nThe story begins with a first-year high schooler in Yuuta Hibiki, a protagonist that is already shrouded in mystery, he wakes up to discover he has no memories. After a series of events, he meets the Hyper Agent Gridman who is inside an old computer, which is referred to as, \u201cJunk.\u201d Gridman tells him that he is needed and he has a mission to fulfil, that only he can do it. Everything is happening so fast but with the help from his classmates, Shou Utsumi and Rikka Takarada, he embarks on a quest to realize the revelation from Gridman and to regain his lost memories. Part of this quest revolves around in fighting against these giant kaiju that have suddenly appeared and have been causing havoc and destruction. It\u2019s later revealed that his fellow classmate Akane Shinjou has been designing these creatures who are then brought to life by a menacing being that has been influencing and guiding Akane in Alexis Kerib. \\n\\n\r\nSSSS.Gridman uses the \u2018monster-of-the-week\u2019 formula where Akane designs a new Kaiju that Alexis brings to life, and Yuuta, who is aided by his friends and a special team of characters\u2014who are essentially the Hyper Agent\u2019s assist weapons\u2014go out to defeat the creatures and protect the city with the help of Gridman. Yuuta is Gridman's partner and is able to merge with him through the Primal Acceptor device which then he uses the phrase, \"Access Flash,\" to allow the inter-dimensional being to materialize in this world. What Yuuta and the others find puzzling is after the colossal-like battles, the city has seemingly been restored and everyone\u2019s memory but their own has been wiped clean of those events. There is always a twist around every corner of this story, everyone besides the main cast also, cannot remember those that were murdered by the Kaiju or were caught in the crossfire, it\u2019s as if they never existed. This gives our protagonist even more motivational to search for the truth behind these mysteries.\\n\\n\r\nInitially, the characters felt bland but you soon realize that they just don\u2019t have the \u2018anime troupe\u2019 kind of personalities. I\u2019d go as far to say they are well-made seeing that they are depicted in a realistic manner\u2014from the tone in which they speak, their vocabulary, the way they react to various situations and their decision making is very relatable to us as the audience. They talk and act like human beings, they are grounded characters who are genuine and share many similar flaws that are common in adolescence. I think the most interesting character in the story is also the one who happens to be the biggest \u2018asshole\u2019 for the majority of the runtime and that is Akane. Sometimes she feels like the main character, seeing that the source of these events is directly in service of the decisions she makes that are heavily influenced by Alexis, and, tragic experiences from her past. She\u2019s trying to create this world where she can escape from a reality that she detests, and Rikka is very much connected to this, which you can also see from the visual messages of the ED.\\n\\n\r\nThere are consequences here for Akane for the power she wields, she develops a God complex, the fine line of reality and morality becomes blurred, and she becomes more unstable that her bubbly fa\u00e7ade can\u2019t suppress her true self. This becomes more evident the more she interacts with a Kaiju she created named Anti, whose sole purpose was to kill Gridman. He ends up becoming the stories anti-hero. Akane is clearly a psychologically damaged individual, harbouring murderous intent towards anyone that pisses her off, even over something so minor. In a turn of events, our protagonists are now the ones trying to wake her from this twisted reality she has created. There is an opportunity for a \u2018redemption\u2019 story for Akane, one that proves to be very controversial once the story reaches the ninth episode and onwards. This is where you really need to pay attention, as these episodes are some of the best directed this year, which is thanks to such an all-star team that is made up of upcoming, promising talents from TRIGGER, Tsuburaya and others.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, director Akira Amemiya has proven to be a formidable talent, he and his team have combined the elements of tokusatsu, kaiju, mecha, and Gainax to evolve the TRIGGER model, thus establishing itself as something new and refreshing. A truly remarkable job production wise. The cinematography is outstanding, the shot composition is done so well along with various other techniques like framing, following the rule of the thirds, leading lines, the centre dominate eye and symmetry that made the imagery aesthetically pleasing, and helped conveyed the visual messages and themes, giving us multiple unique perspectives. The animation, including the CG, was top-notch, fluid, movie-like and firing on all cylinders when it came to Gridman\u2019s encounters with the Kaiju, the action sequences and choreography were eye candy. Visually, the characters designs and layouts were impressive, the background art and architecture were alluring and helped you immerse into this world, especially given the number of details implemented in. \\n\\n\r\nAs you would guess, the score draws a lot of similarities the tokusatsu shows, especially when it comes to Gridman\u2019s main theme and battle sequences. A fair share of scenes, go without background music, but when it plays, it to heighten the mood and emotion, giving those scenes the impactful punch. You\u2019ll get accustomed to the OP, \"UNION\" by OxT, because it serves in many scenes regarding Gridman himself. It\u2019s very catchy. The ED, \"youthful beautiful\" by Maaya Uchida, is a moving ballad. The imagery in both the OP and ED is what really makes them worth watching, they are filled with a lot of symbolism. The casting humanizes these characters, making them feel more authentic and capturing some emotion that \u2018anime troupe\u2019 personalities are incapable of.\\n\\n\r\nSSSS.Gridman isn\u2019t a perfect show, there are definitely areas that could be explored more, there are a few unanswered questions but it made a great effort to tie loose ends within 12 episodes when this is a type of story that needs 12 more. This is not a popcorn flick, it requires you to pay attention to really understand what is going on. It has a bit of everything that is generally liked by most fans of anime from relatable characters, blood-pumping action, amazing visuals, subtle-comedy that is filled with references, there\u2019s twists, suspense and quintessentially executes the \u2018show, don\u2019t tell\u2019 approach. After the controversy from Darling of the FranXX, this love letter to the tokusatsu era is sure to be a mark of something new for studio TRIGGER.\\n",

            "content": "(WARNING: Some spoilers)\r\nI\u2019ll admit being fairly biased when it comes to most TRIGGER produced shows, especially with the likes of Kill La Kill, Little Witch Academia, and Kiznaiver; even Darling in the FranXX, with all the screw-ups it had down the final stretch, was still very enjoyable for me personally. So when the announcement for SSSS Gridman (or as I call it, SSSS Sleepman) came around, I was initially hyped and hoping that this series gives me a more positive outlook for mecha series in general. However, a little later on, when the visuals for the character and kaiju designs were released for the publiceye to see, a part of me thought \u201cthe show is gonna do something to really upset or bore me\u201d. At the time, I genuinely hoped my suspicions were wrong and that I would be able to overlook this sense of doubt I had, so I kept a fair amount of optimism heading into the season of Fall 2018. I mean, even the PV made it seem really promising.\\n\\n\r\nNow when I think about it, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever comprehend why Gridman supposedly deserves so much praise, even if I understand why it does. I understand that my opinion is probably in the minority and that I might get called out by excessively sensitive fans of this show or tokusatsu-related stuff in general. Nevertheless, I want to try to at least explain why I think SSSS Gridman, which is actually based off of a retro tokusatsu series called Ultraman, is the most \u201cover-praised\u201d show I\u2019ve ever watched in a long time.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 2/10\\n\r\nThe story starts off with a young man named Yuuta Hibiki waking up without any prior memories, later befriending the likes of Rikka \u201cThunder Thighs\u201d (a nickname I decided to go with) Takarada amd Shou Utsumi, who said they are his fellow classmates. Yuuta later meets Hyper Agent GRIDMAN through an ancient-as-hell PC, who tells him to \u201cfulfill his purpose\u201d.  All the sudden, a kaiju appears out of nowhere, setting the stage and course for the show.\\n\r\nRight off the bat, the show wants to use the \u201camnesia\u201d factor, a plot device that is often misused, especially in many sci-fi shows. Yuuta\u2019s lack of memories limited his capacity to think or act in a logical manner, and without the likes of Gridman and his friend circle, he probably would be going off making too many ridiculous mistakes. Even the eventual revelations regarding Yuuta\u2019s memories were cheaply written to make him look even more like not just a generic \u201cchosen one\u201d with plot armor, but a literal deus ex machina manifestation. So you\u2019re telling me that the Yuuta we\u2019ve followed throughout the entirety of the show ain\u2019t really Yuuta at all, but actualy Gridman in a \u201cYuuta\u201d body that had NO memories to begin with? Regardless of the details, that\u2019s not exactly the best way to go about with a character you\u2019ve decided to give up making a decent backstory on. Heck, only maybe one character in the entirety of the show got a fairly good structure in terms of background\u2026.I\u2019ll get to that later, though.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the structure of the show itself, it is basically a rinse-and-repeat episodic format. While I\u2019m okay with episodic formats most of the time, this show doesn\u2019t really know how to give much more structure outside of a kaiju/character of the week theme with 15-20 minutes of detached character dialogue and awkward durations of silence during certain frames, usually centered around adolescent school life, followed by 5-10 minutes of wonky, mostly CG-fied action coupled with intentionally cheesy names for transformations and attacks. The first few episodes seem quite fine due to the appeal of the action, but afterwards, you\u2019d have to think it\u2019d get boring due to lack of proper exposition and emotion. When the story finally does get some sort of progression due to the constant atmosphere the show tries to emulate, it\u2019s very underwhelming even with the plot twists that try to be very compelling.\\n\\n\r\nLet me bring some pet peeves I had with the story: apparently, Akane is a main antagonist for the majority of the show, and at one point, was considered the \u201cgod\u201d of this apparently \u201cfake\u201d world that the story takes in, due to the generic backstory of \u201cnot really having many friends, if at all\u201d, and thus wanting to create an ideal world for herself (though it\u2019s later revealed that Alexis played a major part for that in terms of pulling the strings\u2026typical ass villain shenanigans). Our main group did find out at some point that Akane was responsible for making the kaijus that were causing havoc. While I can agree that Akane does not seem like a true villain despite her odd, \u201cfuck everything else\u201d manner, and that they should not go ahead and kill her\u2026.why the hell did they not at least try to physically stop her in some other way? Logically, wouldn\u2019t that provoke the real baddie to take action and reveal himself, so that the good guys can finally face the true adversary? Then the story wouldn\u2019t need to try to overdose the audience with so much mystery elements and force drama at the end to make itself seem more compelling in nature.\\n\r\nLikewise, Akane at some point found out that Yuuta is the vessel of Gridman and the cause of her failures with the artificial kaiu, and was able to physically meet him when he is still a normal human being\u2026.why does she not, at the time, try to kill him when she\u2019s in the perfect position to do so, or even call Alexis to do the dirty job? It really seemed like the backstory around her tried to make an excuse as to why she didn\u2019t try to eliminate the good guys during the handful of times she had the opportunity. The rush to make her a sympathetic antagonist was not very appealing, considering that she displayed no redeemable character qualities to begin with\u2026trying to make her be savvy in tone and mannerism is such a generic gimmick to make gullible viewers buy into her more easily. One more thing, the series\u2019s attempts to be clever with giving clues to the mystery are just nothing more than something to try to keep the audience more interested.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 7/10\\n\r\nFor the most part, the soundtracks are honestly quite solid, but I will say that the opening and ending theme are polar opposites in nature. The opening theme, sung by OxT, is a very grandiose soundtrack that would fit more with most shounen shows...heck, it actually sounds like something that belongs in the likes of stuff like Digimon, Cardfight Vanguard, and Yugioh. The ending theme, on the other hand, sung by Maaya Uchida, who is well known for her contributions to several Chuunibyou theme songs, as well as voicing the main heroine of that show (whom is, coincidentally enough, is also named Rikka\u2026.who woulda thunk it). The visuals of the ending theme, which I want to note here in particular, showcase shots of Rikka and Akane, making them seem very close friends. This isn\u2019t very surprising because the ending theme would be made to fit in shows centered on school drama and/or adolescent romance.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the soundtracks are nice, but very sparse and not utilized enough, because the majority of the show is filled with silent still-frames. The voice acting is kinda lifeless or bland, and any sort of emotion seemed very forced to an attempt to balance out the lack of cohesiveness and chemistry in terms of dialogue.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION: 6/10\\n\r\nFirst off, the 2D animation is actually hella good, and felt very reminiscent of the good ol\u2019 Trigger shows, except they look hella cleaner and more detailed. There\u2019s nothing much else to say about that.\\n\\n\r\nNow here\u2019s a big bugaboo: the CG animation. Now before you say why I have to have such an issue regarding 3D animation, I\u2019ll just say this: blame the number of other shows I\u2019ve watched that literally traumatized me with their eye-burning showcases of horrible CGI usage. To be very honest, the 3D designs ain\u2019t that all bad, but their overall movements, especially during the action scenes, felt very wonky\u2026..in particular, the fake kaijus. Again, it points back to how much this show wants to trap the audience in tokusatsu nostalgia by trying to \u201cperfectly emulate\u201d how tokusatsu shows were produced. The wobbly 3D figurines of the kaijus are supposed to imitate someone walking in a monster costume, and the sequences of Gridman getting bigger are supposed to mirror how tokusatsu shows use camera tricks and angles. However, all of this supposedly masterful elements of \u201ccreating art\u201d is simply the show choosing more \u201cstyle over substance\u201d, which is almost never a good thing in the current era of anime. Because of this, the action scenes just felt very awkward to me.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 4/10\\n\r\nI touched upon some stuff regarding Akane much earlier, so I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll need to repeat for her.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of this show, while not god awful, are too bland to really make enough of an impact. Considering the lack of life the show has in general, the cast themselves just don\u2019t really have any unique perks about them would make them legitimately likable characters.\\n\\n\r\nYuuta looks like someone that should\u2019ve belonged to a frigging shounen series, where he would\u2019ve gotten more of a chance for actual character development as well as a more structured background\u2026instead, he comes off as just a bland, mostly clueless individual who is only relevant because he\u2019s the main vessel of Gridman.\\n\\n\r\nRikka seems like a decent character at the start, due to her acting more like a realistic individual compared to the other cast members, but ultimately got sucked into the usual tropes surrounding \u201cfriendship\u201d, which I felt deconstructed her\u2026in the end, she is simply meme fodder due to her thick-as-f*** thighs.\\n\\n\r\nUtsumi. Is. USELESS. He\u2019s simply the typical middle man wearing glasses who feels compelled to overreact to literally anything and everything he\u2019s not familiar with or prepared for. Ultimately, he\u2019s just a fake main character swept up by this sh**storm of a story.\\n\\n\r\nAkane is a character who actually got the most decent of backstories and characterization in the entire show, but what doesn\u2019t feel right to me is that the show tried too hard to make her a sympathetic antagonist, as I mentioned much earlier. She can be waifu material, I guess, but she ain\u2019t mine. Not with that twisted persona\u2026no, not at all did I feel any sympathy for her, I\u2019m sorry. Even with the interesting revelations at the end regarding the truth about her and the world, that by itself does not give a redeemable impression of her.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast just seem hella bland, too. The kids from the school really are just there for the background, regardless of whether or not they\u2019re there cause it\u2019s some fake world or something. Even the self-named \u201cNeon Genesis\u201d gang of the human avatars of Gridman\u2019s equipment are one-dimensional and quite forgettable in all honesty. Calibur and Max did look cool at first, but the lack of depth just makes them fodder characters only made relevant due to being associated with the main characters. There is one notable character that I did honestly give a nod to: the human Kaiju. His constant drive to want to beat Gridman was initially very obnoxious, but after interactions with the likes of more sane humans like Rikka (cause f*** Akane), as well as watching Gridman\u2019s battles from the sidelines, he started to really question himself as to what his purpose should be, and whether or not he had to find a new reason to fight and/or live. This was, however, downplayed by yet another deus ex machina implementation, where his evolution turned him into basically an entity almost exactly like the original Gridman. I don\u2019t understand why they needed to fall back to such lazy scriptwriting like that for him. As for Alexis, he\u2019s just a typical run-of-the-mill villain who only attempts to seem different by sounding savvy and friendly whenever possible, which is just lame way to go off the status quo.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 4/10\\n\r\nNow before anyone tries to get at me saying I don\u2019t understand tokusatsu\u2026.trust me, I\u2019ve watched quite a bit of tokusatsu films back when I was very young, though I have forgotten the majority of which films exactly that I watched back then. I completely understand the nod to tokusatsu shows that this series tried to make and then emulate. I get it! Ok?! Honestly, though, tokusatsu shows are better off sticking to live action, in my honest opinion. In anime form, it just doesn\u2019t really transfer over well.\\n\r\nWhile I will say that as JUST as a straight-up recreation of tokusatsu, this show does extremely well and would deserve at least a B+ for it. But in terms of being an anime series in general, it doesn\u2019t cut it due to the lack of character structure, superfluous storywriting, and the constant need to puff out copious amounts of nostalgia clouds.\\n\\n\r\nAfter around five to six episodes in, the redundancy of each progressing episode lowered my levels of expectations and excitement, to where I decided to no longer include the show in my reactions on my own YouTube channel. Despite this, watching the show on my own time was not that far off from feeling like a chore up until the final stretch, where the show tried to be interesting with the revelations and plot twists. However, it failed to really appeal to me enough outside of flashy action scenes.\\n\\n\r\nFINAL WORD: \\n\r\nWhile I don\u2019t think this is a necessarily awful show, I honestly believe that this show is just \u201cgassed up\u201d for the most part, and is honestly tasteless. The series tends to use the nostalgia factor and mecha action appeal to try to make itself look good, but lacks in structure and depth in terms of story and characters. It\u2019s honestly one of the most underwhelming shows I\u2019ve ever watched in recent years.\\n\\n\r\nIf you do want to watch something based off retro shows that has actual depth, solid storywriting, and interesting characters, here\u2019s one series I\u2019d recommend: Casshern Sins (based off 1973 Casshan show). That show has heavy themes and well-written characters, and while its nature of its story pacing feels weird, thus making it a hard recommendation, there is considerably more emotion and thought-provoking elements; the action scenes in that show, while not very common, are actually quite entertaining as well.\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re that kind of person who will try to watch and enjoy a show with your brain turned off, I\u2019d say go ahead and knock yourself out. Whether you like it or not, that\u2019s your choice. I\u2019m by no means trying to force you to not watch it or change your perspective on it. I\u2019m simply stating my good-to-honest thoughts regarding a show that people tried to give too much credit to.",

            "content": "Anime consumers typically stay loyal to certain genres or a specific franchise when they purchase goods. I\u2019m not an avid fan of collecting anime merchandise but I've seen people with stacks and shelves filled with anime figures. Out of all the genres though, mecha seems to be one that I\u2019ve always been fascinated by. In recent years, it seems mecha shows have caused a bit of controversy. From Full Metal Panic to Darling in the Frankxx, they can either be really, really good or pretty damn despicable. \r\nPerhaps we shouldn\u2019t jump too far ahead. Studio Trigger has been able to produce series with memorable qualityfrom their lineup. Sure, Darling in the Frankxx was a show that had a divided fan base but who can forget some of their other phenomenal work like Kill la Kill or Little Witch Academia? SSSS.Gridman got announced during Summer 2017 and to think, it also stands out as a celebration for the 25th anniversary of the original Denkou Choujin Gridman from 1993. I think if you\u2019re a fan of tokusatsu programs, then you may be prepared for a treat. But if you\u2019re not, be prepared for a wildly bizarre adventure.\\n\\n\r\nI should say right off the bat that SSSS.Gridman\u2019s synopsis may take a few times to read before getting a first impression of what the show may be really about. It reminds me of a bit of blending between the Western and Japanese culture. We have mecha that somehow reminds me of Transformers, action heroes that feel like they are in the role as Power Rangers, and battles that resemble Pacific Rim. When I was young, there was a time when I watched Power Rangers especially the classics like Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. However, I was never too big in the Ultraman franchise despite also being a tokusatsu classic. When people mention Ultraman, SSSS.Gridman also comes to my mind with the similar style of presentation. The first few episodes quickly unravels a dark plot about Akane Shinjo. As a central antagonist, she has a troubling personality and holds disturbing grudges towards those who \u201cwrongs her\u201d. She could be someone you would call a sociopath and can be highly manipulative. When we meet Akane the first time, it doesn\u2019t take long to realize that there\u2019s something deeply wrong about her inner personality. And honestly, a type of character like her easily brings in trouble into the main story.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, our main story involves protagonist Yuta Hibiki who wakes up with no apparent memory. As the human host of Gridman, he fulfills the role of an action hero. That is, he fights the Kaiju (the main monsters in the show) and protects the innocent. You could say he is the show\u2019s friendly neighborhood Spiderman type of guy who swings into action when trouble knocks at doors. Thankfully, he gets assistance not just from Gridman but also from his friends. These the Gridman Alliance such as Shou, Rikka, and members of the Neon Genesis Junior High Students. The show reveals more about their roles as Yuta develops an alliance between them. However, the elephant in the room should be addressed. Why should you care about a story that resembles something done over a decade ago? \\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned before, most anime fans tends to favor genres that they\u2019ve really experienced with. SSSS.Gridman blends a variety that\u2019s draws the line of science fiction, mecha, and super hero. The plot isn\u2019t hard to understand but may take some take to get attached to. Mainly, some of the first half resembles more of the Monster of the Week format where a hero fights against an enemy, defeats it, and saves the day. But don\u2019t worry, the show does get more complex later on that deals with their world and Akane herself. I\u2019m not going to throw spoilers as the show gets fairly dark as every episode progresses. Maybe that\u2019s even an understatement because right from the start, this show had an unsettling mood. I\u2019ll make this crystal clear now. Characters that die doesn\u2019t just result in death but disappear completely. Erased from seemingly existing. If that doesn\u2019t instill a sense of fear, then I don\u2019t know what does.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond the dark story, we\u2019re also treated with character relationships that play some key emphasis on the show altogether. Akane, Yuta, and Rikka stars as the main characters and they connect on a level that is fairly important. By understanding each other, they establish character connection that the viewers can get invested in. This is especially true to learn about character motivations such as Rikka\u2019s desire to be a hero despite wanting to live a normal life. Or in the opposite case, Rikka\u2019s resentment and desire for revenge for those who wronged her. Indeed, Rikka is a complex character, perhaps one of the hardest to accept but also incredibly enticing to watch for her unpredictable role. Her character expressions often hides her fa\u00e7ade like a monster would. It\u2019s as if she\u2019s always wearing a mask as a beautiful creature on the outside and a harbinger of death on the inside.\\n\\n\r\nWith 12 episodes, some questions popped to my head made me wonder if it\u2019s really enough. Despite the show having a more serious storytelling, it still retains lighthearted moments and humor. Not to mention, we also got an obligatory beach episode to service the fans and one other particular episode to showcase Kajiu\u2019s human-like behaviors. Viewers will also likely to poke fun at some of the character interactions and behaviors such as Akane\u2019s hikikomori-like lifestyle. I think what the producers were aiming for is resurrecting this franchise as a way to pay homage to the original series while crafting its own story. It definitely succeeds at that when committing to its genres without stepping out of its comfort zone.\\n\\n\r\nAmong the many elements of the show, one that\u2019s impossible to evade is the style of its artwork. Studio Trigger has been known to make some extravagant cinematography with its battle contents. Here, SSSS.Gridman succeeds in similar ways. The action is over the top like how a tokusatsu show should be. From the first few episodes, it manages to showcase just how dangerous the Kajiu are and what they can do. Gridman himself has abilities that can neutralize monsters such as energy lasers and is incredibly durable as a fighting Hyper Agent. Make no mistake though. The monsters themselves are formidable ranging from the debut of Ghoulghalias to the deadly Devadadan. Each of them are decorated with impressive fighting capabilities and poses a threat to humanity. Similar to Godzilla in size, it\u2019s nightmares coming to life in their world. The CGI was easy to get accompanied to and adds a colorful style to the overall character designs. Oh and before I forgot to mention, Rikka has some really meaty legs.\\n\\n\r\nI should say while SSSS.Gridman is more suitable for the Japanese audience, it can hit home for newer fans too. Prior to watching this show, I had little experience with tokusatsu related shows outside of Ultraman. Hell, Ultraman was an iconic franchise but that hasn\u2019t been resurrected as a full anime show in a long time (2019 does have one though). Outside of Asia, tokusatsu had limited popularity so perhaps SSSS.Gridman could raise the bar. Funimation dubbed the series for the Western audience we may see more coming ahead.",

            "content": "Opinions on SSSS.Gridman are widely divided: you either love it or hate it. Interestingly enough, those who hate it all have similar criticisms, mainly the premise is unoriginal, the title is stupid, the action just rips off Ultraman, etc. To such comments I would say: do your homework and maybe you\u2019ll learn something. The source material (because yes, this is based on something) was a sentai show from the height of the tokusatsu era. And let\u2019s face it, every sentai show has at least 87% Ultraman-inspired content. It just goes with the territory.\r\nRegarding the story however, Trigger has decided to move away from the typicalPower Ranger-esque scenarios and inject more characterization and atypical pacing into the anime. This, I think is a good thing. The original Superhuman Samurai Syber Squad (yes it is a dumb name, and yes it is misspelled for the sake of alliteration. Blame DIC Entertainment, who brought Gridman to the US market for that.) was probably even less popular in the US than contemporary shows like Beetleborgs. So switching up the story for the anime gives opportunity to rise above mediocre sentai action to something with actual substance. The show mixes the expected kaiju fights with slice-of-life scenes along with unexplained plot points yet to be revealed. Is there a *reason* everyone in the town seems somewhat bland and full of ennui? Is there more to the town then appears at first glance? And WTF is with the insanely immense ever-present daikaiju that everyone just kinda ignores? Only story development and plot progression will tell. =)\\n\\n\r\nAnd the characters themselves play a large role in that development as they themselves progress in their relationships and understanding of the world around them. And character development involves realistic situations in slice-of-life environments, not the continual amped-up, hyper, in your face action of a typical shonen anime. Heck, there\u2019s more fight scenes in MHA, but the cast doesn\u2019t run around in rage mode all the time (except Bakugo, but he\u2019s... unique).\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is decent, granted not Trigger\u2019s best, but sufficient for conveying the jagged atmosphere of a robot-versus-giant-monster scenario. And the music, while sparse, matches the understated feel of the characters well. \\n\\n\r\nSo, it\u2019s a mecha/kaiju anime with a different slant that pays homage to its roots. It\u2019s not Gundam, it\u2019s not Code Geass, heck, it\u2019s not even the original Gridman. There\u2019s plenty of shows out there like those but there\u2019s not many anime that feel like SSSS.Gridman. But I\u2019m glad there\u2019s at least one =)",

She is sighing constantly and has no expressions. \r\nMay be she is supposed to reflect the audience response while watching this anime. \r\nOnly good thing about her is her character design, which is pretty good. \r\nMC has a generic supportive sidekick.

As I was watching Guriddoman I felt a sense of emptiness in the show and I started wondering about what others thought about this show. So I thought I would write my honest review of this show.\r\nStory: The story revolves around this yung redhead lad who has amnesia. This dude goes on trip and talks to a computer and they fight together against Godzillas. This is simplified episode synopsis for the initial 5 episodes. This made it feel like I was watching some pokemon episodes where main characters are doing their thinguntil obnoxious antagonist arrives and the protagonist defeats em. It felt like watching same episode over and over again. What was able to keep me watching was big bob the builder (referring to boobs) girl and the dark gurren lagann looking thing. The plot never had anything else interesting in it to keep me hooked for the first 4 episodes. In general Gridman felt like I was watching some lame ass mecha PG-7 anime for children(minus the parts where Akane ordered to kill someone). \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: We have a MC with amnesia. This is a good start since it fucking destroys his whole personality(not like there was any in the beginning because of amnesia). We have MC's friend who doesn't neither show almost any personality aside from drooling for Akane (big bob girl). Main heroine is a tsundere bait that in reality just doesn't give a fuck. She doesn't show much of emotions aside from time to time some cute behavior so that she doesn't seem like to be just dead inside (She also learns to smile towards the end). Then we have team Gridman support group. This consist some forgettable characters and their only reason is to be Gridman's augementations. So the cast is Optimus Prime's sonic wing and super mode (Transformers: Cybertron), Gurren Lagann drill mode and sword mode (couldn't think any reference but sword is pretty generic). Not too original. To me only interesting characters are the antagonists Akane and Alexis echo. Akane's motives are lacking so Alexis is probably controlling her for it's own purpose.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation: I won't tackle on this too hard but the fighting animations are orgasmic and on par with Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. High Quality CG.\\n\\n\r\nSounds: Musics are good too but nothing ground breaking. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and conclusion: I cant really enjoy anything in this show except \\n\r\nfor animation and sounds. It's just overall a mediocre mecha anime in my opinion.  Be sure to give me some (constructive) criticism if you feel like it, I would really appreciate it.",

            "content": "You\u2019ll have to excuse the history lesson, but for those of you who don\u2019t know, the Tokusatsu (\u7279\u64ae) Genre, more commonly known as \u201ctoku\u201d, is the East Asian cultural description for science fiction TV and film that utilizes a certain brand of special effects to bring super-powered and/or overlarge action set pieces to life, which are usually in service of monstrous kaiju (\u602a\u7363). While much of this culture has remained fairly regional, some immensely popular exceptions including but not limited to Godzilla, Ultraman, and Kamen Rider have become somewhat iconic on an international scale, even including some western productions like King Kong and Pacific Rim.If any of those examples rung any bells for you, then you already know what to expect from SSSS.Gridman. It\u2019s good old Monster of the Week style storytelling with kaiju fighting giant mechas in bombastically destructive action sequences. That said, being a characteristically original and unique story as expected from Studio Trigger, SSSS.Gridman has far more intrigue and character than the basic toku formula could even begin to offer and uses the genre\u2019s inherent simplicity as a solid foundation to craft their own masterwork.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll begin discussion with the only aspect of the show that I could\u2019ve and honestly should\u2019ve had a problem with, which just happens to be the main character, Yuta Hibiki. My potential problem with Yuta, for there was really only one issue, is the fact that Yuta had amnesia at the start of the story, which is a trope that I hate to death (nor do I know a single person who likes it either.) Luckily, this is Trigger. This is a show with more love, creativity, and passion behind it than you could ever begin to imagine, so it\u2019s not like Yuta had amnesia just to be a self-inset MC or something, it\u2019s for plot reasons, but even with that defense it doesn\u2019t even matter because they still forged pure gold with it. You see, while Yuta has lost all of his memories, he still has his emotions, which makes him a breeze to characterize and empathize with right out of the gate. It\u2019s just like Trigger to take one of the most trite and overused tropes in the book, make the simplest yet most fresh alteration, and walk away with their own original treasure trove. Yuta aside, the other characters are totally flawless in their own right. Forget all the loud, obnoxious, autistic anime dialogue you\u2019re presented with by all the other seasonal garbage your watching as SSSS.Gridman and it\u2019s small, focused, highly developed main cast presents you with the exact same humanity, realism, and complexity you\u2019d expect from Trigger and their past roots in Gainax. Akane, Rikka, and Utsumi who make up the remaining main character cast are extremely multilayered, flawed, and human characters reminiscent of the cast of Neon Genesis Evangelion. The dialogue is turned down to a minimum, and the strong direction and passionately drawn facial animation brings the characters to life without them having to scream about their emotions for an entire episode like you\u2019d get from any other show. It\u2019s quiet, emotional, tonal, and contemplative, allowing you to sit down with the characters, look at them in their beautiful detailed eyes, and really get to know them as if they were people, you know?\\n\\n\r\n\u2026AND THEN THE ACTION KICKS IN AND GRINDS YOUR BRAIN THROUGH A FUCKING CHEESE GRATER!!!\\n\\n\r\nAkira Amemiya, the director of SSSS.Gridman and living legend Hiroyuki Imaishi\u2019s up-and-coming prot\u00e9g\u00e9, is a fanboy of Trigger, Gainax, and mecha anime just like you and I, and boy does it show or what!?! He knew exactly how to give the fans precisely what kind of action spectacle they wanted because he is a fan too. The action direction is epic as hell, using no shortage of extrapolated perspective shots, panoramic cinematography, sweeping angels, and even grounded perspective shots to show you just how monstrous and utterly enormous the fighting mechas and kaiju really are. CG animation is employed expertly to mercilessly rip an entire city to shreds right before your eyes and then throw whole buildings in your face, to have flawlessly detailed models of mechas and kaiju alike thrown across the screen and back again four times per second, and to show ginormous mechanical limbs scrape dozens of cars up across the street only to immediately send them soaring through the air and smashing into hellish fireballs as they hit their equally destructive and killer targets. On top of the pristine CG work, the absolute gods animating this show hand drew almost all of the static-framing shots and transformation sequences that show Gridman being as legendary as The Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann himself. Jesus, it\u2019s so awesome! I could go on for hours, but if you\u2019re at all missing Hiroyuki Imaishi\u2019s bombastic action hurricanes like Kill la Kill or Gurren Lagann, or Kazuya Tsurumaki\u2019s iconic environment breaking pan-out shots of the single most unforgettable action genre staples such as FLCL or Diebuster, then you absolutely MUST watch SSSS.Gridman because it brought it all back and more! \\n\\n\r\nThe amount of sheer love and inspiration that clearly brought this show to life shines through every single frame of it\u2019s display. Densely drawn artwork, poppy personable character animation, naturalistic character driven dialogue, and highly imagined direction are all there as Trigger is known for, but in addition to all that Amemiya\u2019s fresh directing style adds so many more all-new layers that have yet to take part in Trigger\u2019s crazy genius formula. If a character gets mad, for example, then Amemiya will bring in this weird semi-horror direction that makes the scene almost thrilling. There\u2019s so many occasions that the framing angles, the lighting effects, the zoom effects, or the color palette will do this interesting little shift that makes the scene feel so refreshing and inspired. Sometimes it\u2019s weirdness is a bit much, but, personally, I\u2019d rather watch a show which fails to fit the mold due to its uncontainable creativity and innovation, like SSSS.Gridman, than watch a show which fails to fit the mold due to its sheer incompetence, like basically everything else currently airing.\\n\\n\r\nDo you know why FLCL had a totally random South Park style episode? \\n\r\nIt\u2019s because Kazuya Tsurumaki and his team at Gainax had been watching South Park in the office and thought it\u2019d be a funny meme to put in the show. \\n\r\nDo you know why the Inferno Cop anime got made? \\n\r\nIt\u2019s because Hiroyuki Imaishi and his team at Trigger were jokingly dared by their fans on Twitter to make it after episode eleven of Space Patrol Luluco came out. \\n\r\nDo you know why Ragyo Kiryuin\u2019s hair was always framed to make her glowing hair look like horns? \\n\r\nIt\u2019s because Kazuki Nakashima had recently read the original Devilman manga and told the Trigger character designers to have her look \u201cdemonic in nature.\u201d \\n\r\nDo you know why Akko was accepted into Luna Nova Academy even though she couldn\u2019t use magic properly?\\n\r\nIt\u2019s because You Yoshinari was accepted into the anime industry before he could animate key frames, and he wanted his protagonist to be relatable.\\n\\n\r\nAll of these examples are able to be made because this line of creators are known for their involvement in the fandom, the fact that they actually care about the story they\u2019re telling, and they\u2019re equally impassioned about the way they go about telling them. Akira Amemiya has proven himself to be no exception. He\u2019s lived up to his successors and I couldn\u2019t possibly be more excited to see his future works with Trigger, because SSSS.Gridman was just as much of a loved and cared for passion-project as any other Trigger or Gainax show ever was! I was skeptical after suffering though A-1 Pictures in the FranXX, but this new team truly was able to bring Trigger\u2019s genuine style and imagination without their established legendary creators holding the reins. \\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading.",

            "content": "(There will be spoilers in this review.)\r\nArt and Animation: For me personally, the word mediocre perfectly encapsulates it. I see people heaping a lot of praise on the CG of the Gridman, but being slightly better that your contemporaries, in this department, hardly warrants all the commendation. 2D animation can be summed up by the word decent.\r\nSound: I think this section is highly subjective. I didn't like nor the OP nor the ED, and can't remember a single piece of background music, but that doesn't mean you won't like any of the music in Gridman aswell, you'll just have to listen to it and findout for yourself.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: It's sort of there, but at the same time it's not. Essentially, pretty much every episode follows an extremely simplistic formula of \"Have 15 minutes of inane chit-chat in a high-school-esque setting, then be alerted to the presence of a new Kaiju and have a 5-minute long one-sided fight\", and that's about it. I will elaborate on what final episodes bring us a bit later.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nYuuta: He's not a character, he's merely a vessel for Gridman. The fact that he's an amnesiac is also very convenient cause that just takes off some work from the scriptwriter, as the typical amnesic character is defined solely by that trait and, therefore, doesn't require any personality at all.\\n\\n\r\nUtsumi: By his own admission in the last episode, a completely useless character that serve barely any purpose and is defined by a single trait of being a Kaiju fanatic.\\n\\n\r\nRikka: At first she seems somewhat interesting, as she's protrayed as an apathetic person that sighs every 10 seconds and hardly seems interested in anything, but later evolves (devolves?) into your typical \"friendship is paramount and is above all else\" character.\\n\\n\r\nAkane: I will cover her more in-depth down the line.\\n\\n\r\nHyper Agents: They're so cookie-cutter you can guess their personalities from their design. It seems like their reason d'etre is to simply provide upgrades for the primary Gridman unit so he can show a new attack in an episode. They claim they have a purpose and are here to deal with Alexis, but strangely enough spent 85% of their time lounging in Rikka's shop, doing absolutely nothing.\\n\\n\r\nRikka's mom: She's there. She mostly just cheers the main cast from the sideline, even though she appears to be bewildered by everything that's going on.\\n\\n\r\nRikka's classmates: They're also there.\\n\\n\r\nAnti: A very moody young man who is defined by a single trait of wanting to destroy Gridman, as that his reason for existance. He later undergoes a character development after standing for 30 seconds in the rain and listening to Akane, after which he decides he's a good guy now.\\n\\n\r\nAlexis: He's an evil man that's evil, he takes pleasure in depraved acts of destruction and suffering of the people. Your typical Trigger antagonist.\\n\\n\r\nEnding analysis: My take on the ending is that Akane is actually a real-life person, that appears to be bullied at school, probably because she's geeky and nerdy, due to her affection for Kaiju and Gundams, so when she comes home she, probably, writes a story (aka the actual Gridman show we see), and that's her method of releasing her frustration and coping with the stress (as she destroys things, then fixes them right back, and also removes umpleasant characters).\\n\r\nWhat supports this theory is that characters in the show recognize her as a god, just like writer is technically a god to the characters he created. The symbolism in Gridman and Alexis, is that Alexis is the evil within Akane, due to all the bullying, and Gridman is that proverbial remaining light of hope, which fixes everything by the end (he does this quite literally with his Fixer Beam). Rikka is just a perfect friend that Akane wishes she had in a real world. Utsumi low-key looks like a love interest Akane would've liked, as he's a giant Kaiju geek and all. The final frames are also that of real world, shot with an actual camera, and we can see Rikka's gift to Akane on the table, which further confirms my idea. \\n\r\nAll said and done, by no means do I think this is correct, or anything plausible to begin with, but who knows. Seems a little too deep for a show that essential a one giant homegae to a lot of different titles.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: A typical Trigger fair, style and action over subtelty and substance. I personally cannot recommend it, even if it had some interesting moments and, perhaps, even some meaningful and intersting concept that ended up being butchered.\\n\r\nI think the original Gridman, with it's abundance of pyrothecnical effects and models of cities being crushed by actors wearing monster suits, is a vastly superior experience. But if that's (understandably) might not be your cup of tea, and you would rather watch some mecha anime, then I would recommend you Shin Getter Robo Armageddon, Gundam franchise (Zeta and 0083, specifically, are quite good) and even TTGL, even though I'm not a fan of it.",

You wanted to see what Trigger's latest project is like hoping to see the magic that their previous great works had.\r\nOr...\r\n2.Rikka's Thighs/Akane's Plot.\r\nBut on a serious note.\r\nAt the moment the anime feels like those good old shows we used to watch as kids.Villain plans out how to beat the hero. Villain gets the attention of the hero. And the hero reigns victorious. The Formula for each of the episodes so far is mostly the same. If you were to watch the first episode alone i would not blame you for saying that the shows plotis pretty much non existent. I would like to argue that it was just like goblin slayer's first episode in the sense that they are just giving you a general overview of how everything works in the world. If the first few episode/chapters of goblin slayer are supposed to give you reasons to hate the goblins even more. Then i would argue that the first episode of gridman is to show you what this show has to offer. Big Robots/Mecha's Fighting big Monsters/Kaiju. If you don't like that on it's own its perfectly fine. I would suggest turning off your brain while watching this anime if you are in for a good time.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTL:DR \\n\r\nThis serves as a pretty good substitute for your typical moe anime however replace the cute girls with big mecha fights\\n\r\n8.5/10 for me",

It provided exactly what you\u2019d expect from the genre with a more interesting than average story, even if fairly simple. Its straight to the point without much fluff. I love how it dances around Toku tropes to make something unique while still respecting it\u2019s roots.

            "content": "I couldn't really and I still can't really fully appreciate this anime. Mostly because it is literally  \"mind storming\". What I mean is that the whole story - as I noticed - comes from the old Ultraman story, something my age could not really know.\r\nSo basically I was lost from the start and ended up half lost. The whole anime remains very mysterious until something like episode 6-7. Then you will slowly but surely get to know every important point to fully understand the plot. Anyway it doesn't mean SSSS.Gridman represents a full reflexion show, many parts (not to say, every second half ofeach episode) will feature big mecha fights vs Kaijus. Powerful, joyful and explosives as always ! \\n\\n\r\nThe major positive points are surely the intriguing story (even at the end you might feel quite lost), with a really surprising conclusion. Indeed, to sum up my mind : it in fact tells the story of a young normal girl, inventing in her head, her ideal life, in an ideal city with the ideal persons. But contrary to me, you or any human being, she will actually become the God of her dream and will live in her dream, at a so deep point that she can't figure out how to live normally, she can't turn back.\\n\\n\r\nThis, is the daily routine of many persons : going to work / school / college, coming back to their home, listening to some music while thinking - no, dreaming - about an ideal life. I was really astonished by the fact they told a sad story without even showing any sad side until the last episode. I should probably watch it again with another eye, able to see more than it could by the past. A really interesting show with a catching (for some viewers, heart-breaking) ending / conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, the fact that I was lost and discovered everything progressively cannot be a full positive point. Indeed, it even was a negative point for me, leading to almost dropping the show. What I would like to explain, is that you won't see where the devs wanted to go with their production ; you won't be able to get answer unless you decide to act like \"Ok, I don't get it but let's move forward to learn\".\\n\\n\r\nIf you dislike mysterious and weird stories, better not starting this show. The fighting moments were good but not extremely impressive. Plus, all the characters are quite undevelopped ; you get to know the major parts for the rest of 'em, yuck... Example : what is the real purpose of Hyper Agent ? What is the Neon Genesis High School ? Where does Akane really go at the end ? What would happen to the city ? Who was the little Kaiju girl we see twice in the show ? Etc etc\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe global anime was satisfying to watch - not a masterpiece - but still a great mash up of mechas, fight, waifus (I'm not into stuff like this, but shit, every one claims Rikka or Akane were best girls) and complexed plot. Probably a bigger surprise than a deception, but it was close...",

            "content": "If there is one thing that will always be associated with Japan it's Kaijus. Kaijus are a mainstay in popular culture due to their massive size and their ability to level entire cities with their overwhelming strength. They are pop culture icons with monsters like Godzilla being easily recognisable. But you know what also is associated with Japan? Giant robots. With series like Ultraman or mecha series like Gundam helping to strengthen that idea, it is no wonder we have had robot vs Kaiju shows and movies before. Even today, shows like this one are still being made. With Trigger at the helm of thisanime as well as being a homage to older kaiju movies like the Godzilla and the Ultraman series, it made for some interesting results. \\n\\n\r\nSit back, relax, put on a rubber costume and roar as loud as you can as I present to you the anime review for SSSS.Gridman. Lets begin. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6.5/10\\n\\n\r\nSet in modern day Japan, the story follows Yuuta Hibiki who wakes up in Rikka Takarada's (a fellow classman) house while also suffering from amnesia. He is then shocked to see massive Kaiju just standing in the distance with the city covered by a massive fog and for some reason, aw well as a human looking robot in a very old computer. The next day, the city is attacked by a Kaiju and with the help of the robot in the computer who calls himself Gridman and the help of his classmates Rikka and Shou Utsumi, they managed to defeat the Kaiju. From there \"The Gridman Alliance\" is formed and vows to stop every Kaiju from destroying the city and find out where they come from. \\n\\n\r\nPredictably, the structure for the story is very much a monster of a week type setup. Every episode, they encounter a new Kaiju, smack it around a bit, then get smacked around themselves, only to find a new power and defeat the Kaiju. Meanwhile, the plot is more developed and more is unveiled as they slowly learn the point to all of these Kaiju attacks and why there are massive Kaiju just standing there in the distance. While the plot starts out slow as it is establishing its characters, it starts to pick up and get real interesting, real fast. This is supported by the significance of the characters in the story and some nice curveballs to keep the viewer hooked. \\n\\n\r\nIt is pretty standard affair because I would say it doesn't do anything unique or does anything to make itself unique. But it does things that we have seen before pretty well. The fact we get the villains' perspective early on as well help see both sides and what these characters are essentially fighting for and what they desire. However, it does have a plot dump halfway through the show as to why the things are the way they are. So instead of finding these things out naturally, we essentially just get and exposition dump just so we can move the plot forward. Yeah, that's not good storytelling. If we were told these things in small handfuls, then that's fine, but to tell it all at once leaves the story in a state of mind of \"where to go now?\" Thankfully, it does know where to go next with a greater perspective on the villain and how the villain feels about everything that is happening around his/her perspective. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7.5/10 \\n\\n\r\nYuuta is the bog standard protagonist of the show and along with Gridman, is the character that fights the Kaijus. His amnesia allows him to basically make him a blank slate for the story to help develop his character (even if it is a bit cliched). Just like a standard protagonist, he's naive, too kind for his own good and just wants to help people. He doesn't really have qualities that make him stand out but doesn't do things that make me groan in annoyance. He's just there to be the main protagonist. \\n\\n\r\nShou acts as the comic relief character and is pretty much the enthusiastic one due to his love for Kaijus. Honestly he doesn't have too much relevance to the plot and acts as more as a right hand man for Yuuta to lift his spirit and to motivate him. But it is something that develops later on in the show so you could say it was intentional. But instead lets talk about best girl Rikka as she has some of the best character scenes in the anime and some of the best thighs in anime history due to them being EXTRA THICC. But seriously, she has some interesting development as she doesn't know if everything they are doing is right due to her friendship with the show's villain. She also acts as the middleman when she needs to get some sense into Yutta and Shou or to support them. She slowly becomes a character that stands thighs first above the cast of the show due to her being somewhat relateable. In fact, the show does a nice job of treating these three like actual high school teenagers and not a veteran defence force in stopping Kaijus. It's some nice realism that these are characters that would act like this in real life. \\n\\n\r\nMy favourite character in this show though is the shows main villain named Akane Shinjou. She is another character with some delicious thighs as well. But other than that obvious statement, her character arc throughout the show takes some twists and turns as she sees her world slowly crumble around her thanks to Gridman. Being the one that creates the Kaijus along with her accomplice, Alexis Kerib, in order to shape the city to her liking. She essentially has a god complex as she believes everything is done because she is making everything better. So when The Gridman Alliance appears to defeat the Kaijus she helps create, she doesn't know what to do because the everything is not going her way. This makes her fall from grace throughout the show a rather tragic one because she is only doing what she believes is right to make a better place. \\n\\n\r\nAnti is the final character I want to talk about. He is one of the created kaijus by Akane and Alexis designed specifically to defeat Gridman. All he wants to do is to defeat Gridman because that is his purpose in life. So throughout the show, we see him get told that there is more to life than fighting Gridman and that he is more than just a Kaiju. The show makes us question how much humanity Anti has and if he can have a change of heart by embracing it. He makes a good rival and foil for Gridman by being somewhat of a sympathetic character and you hope he can have some redemption. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 8.5/10 \\n\\n\r\nNow this is where things get interesting. Trigger; I will type it again, TRIGGER. The same studio that brought us shows with great animation like Kill La Kill, Little, Witch Academia and Darling in the Franxx uses, in this series, CGI animation...AND IT WORKS. Let me explain. If this show was done using traditional animation, then you wouldn't be able to see all the little details put into the fight scenes to make it feel authentic. The entire show is an homage to all of the Kaiju related movies and TV shows that uses props, rubber suits and wires to make the fight scenes feel like two people fighting in rubber costumes in the studio full of paper mahce buildings and toy cars. To the way the Kaijus are designed and how they attack using flailing parts of their rubber suit to how Gridman makes his entrance, making it look like it is all on a green-screen. The attention to detail put into this must be applauded because Tigger has clearly done their homework on this. Traditional animation just wouldn't work because of how the Kaijus are designed and how they attack just wouldn't feel as authentic. \\n\\n\r\nNow for the rest of the animation, it does look good with plenty of colour to make it vibrant and the character designs are unique from one another (even if Rikka's mother looks like a character out of flcl). I could go on about Rikka and Akanes' thighs and how you just want to look at them all day but it would make this review too long so I won't dribble on about these \"unique\" features. But I do have a gripe with the animation and that there is still images throughout the show with the characters doing nothing and you just hear background noises or they are just talking. This is especially noticeable in earlier episodes. How bad is it you may ask. Well I would say it is Evangelion bad but just lasts a little bit shorter. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10 \\n\\n\r\nThe Soundtrack can also be considered an homage to shows like Ultraman with its rather cheesy power up moments, its fast beat music in fight scenes, and the fact that the main theme of the show plays whenever Gridman is close to victory. So not only do the fight scenes and designs are authentic, the music is also trying to be authentic by playing the right music at the right time. Sound effects as well help with explosions, sound of collision between Gridman and the Kaijus and how the Kaijus roar also help add to the authenticity.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening \"UNION\" by OxT is made to be more like an opening that you would see in a Saturday morning show with simple zoom ups of the characters and their personalities somewhat to the catchy lyrics that you could sing along to. While it still has some action to get hooked to, it's main selling point for this opening is to kick back and relax as you sing along to the opening. OxT knows how to make a catchy opening song (just look at the first two Overlord openings) and here, I would say there is no exception. It also updates with slight changes to the scenes to keep up with the plot of the show. It is a nice touch. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending sequence is used to highlight the two best girls in the show, Rikka and Akane and their friendship. It uses live action backgrounds with the girls being their animated selves. It likes to show the more good side of Akane and how thoughtful and kind Rikka can be. It is just a nice, pleasant ending sequence. \\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: \\n\\n\r\nSSSS.Gridman is a show that wants to pay homage to old Kaiju shows and films and I would say it does that. The animation and sound do that very well with a story that doesn't require alot of thinking and you can just relax while you watch it. Its characters as well are all likeable (well, except the ones you're supposed to hate) and never rubbed me the wrong way. The show is a complete package with not one aspect dragging the others down as they all compliment each other. I think this is the kind of show Trigger needed to make after Darling in the Franxx. Something that they can have fun making and have people who can make it enjoyable for the viewer. Girdman does this and I would recommend this to someone looking for some good old robot on Kaiju action. \\n\\n\\n\r\nMy personal enjoyment: 8.5/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall score: 7.8/10  Recommendation: Watch it\\n\\n",

            "content": "For those angsty new anime fans bashing on the 'story', 'character', and other supposed failures, this anime is perhaps one of the greatest homages to the tokusatsu TV shows of the 1970-2000's (mostly the Ultraman franchise, which most people don't even know about nowadays). \r\nStory: \r\nFrom the first episode, i could pretty much see how the plot will play out - start off with your MC combining with a giant hero who fights the monsters (kaiju) that appear. Each episode has a different monster, and the hero finds some new way to destroy them. This is probably the generic tokusatsu storyline, and for a modernremake in anime form, Gridman does this quite well, and adds a few extra plot points in.\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nNow, while the CG may seem 'clunky' and annoying, remember that the tokusatsu genre had people in bad-quality plastic constumes acting out the monsters and heroes - so the CG in the anime is already a massive upgrade, not to mention the numerous possibilities that it creates (if you did everything in 2D, the art would be quite horrendous and janky).\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nNot much to say, often comes up with the generic \"opening during battle\" trope which never fails to create goosebumps.\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe characters are admittedly quite one-dimensional and generic, but considering how the main selling point of the show is the Gridman vs Kaiju battle sequences (much like how tokusatsu was only enjoyable because of the battles), I really couldn't care less about the character developments and individual arcs.\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nIf you're looking for some deep, profoundly impacting anime, SSSS. Gridman probably isn't the one to go with. However, if you're simply looking for a quick break from everyday boredom and some superficial fun, Gridman will most likely be one of the more entertaining choices out there.",

            "content": "What a better way to start my first review of the year that with one of the most pleasant surprises that I have taken in the last quarter of 2018. Being the second animated project from the Trigger studio in regards to last year, we move away completely from the whole controversy about whether Darling in the Franxx was a good series or not, to instead witness one of the clearest love letters to the genre of tokusatsu given by the anime industry in recent years.\r\nSSSS.Gridman is an original anime inspired by the tokusatsu live action series 1993-1994 Gridman the Hyper Agent, also referencing withthe SSSS of the title Superhuman Samurai Syber-Squad the American adaptation of Gridman in 1995. Being produced by the studio Trigger with support of Tsuburaya Productions, the company with the rights of Gridman and the Ultra Series (Ultraman, as it is the best known of its work on this side of the world) this series had a total of 12 episodes broadcast between October and December of the year 2018. Directed by Akira Amemiya whose peculiar style had already been seen in Trigger series such as Inferno Cop or Ninja Slayer, with screenplays written by the ultra legendary Keiichi Hasegawa who left his name on the tokusatsu industry being one the main writers of the Ultra Series. The sound direction was provided by Toshiki Kameyama, while the soundtrack was composed by Shir\u014d Sagisu. Meanwhile the design of characters with Masayuki Gotou preparing the designs of Gridman, and Masaru Sakamoto managing the rest of the characters that participated in the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe synopsis of this series is the following: Focusing mainly on Y\u016bta Hibiki, a freshman who lives in the city of Tsutsujidai. Suffering a strange case of amnesia and being able to see a mysterious being called Gridman through an old computer, Yuta will be involved with his friends in the mission to stop the sudden attacks of the huge Kaijus that threaten to wipe out the city and all its inhabitants, while trying to find the answers after all the mysteries that are affecting what they know as reality.\\n\\n\r\nUnder the guise of a simple, somewhat ridiculous and undoubtedly kitschy tokusatsu aimed at the whole family with its already ancestral monster routine of the week, SSSS.Gridman actually presents us with a story a bit darker and stark compared to the original that aims not only those who grew up consuming this genre but also trying to attract a new generation of viewers. Being a thematic sequel that reinterprets and updates several of the concepts of the original of 1993, this is a work that among multiple references and tributes seeks to demonstrate its own value as an individual work. This being a story that uses fighting against monsters as secondary, when the priority is above all to focus on the development of their characters and the need to accept reality instead of escaping from it.\\n\r\nWe are facing a work that does not hesitate to have multiple silent, uncomfortable, or plainly strange scenes that invite you to try to understand the mentality and emotions of its protagonists with what you can infer from their unspoken language or visual narrative. For those who expect great surprises, the turns of this anime may not be satisfactory or even consider how the events progress, but Gridman from the first episode has been a series that has had most of the answers to its mysteries hidden to simple view, waiting for someone to focus on them and get to understand them, thus leading an incredible thematic attachment in all its aspects.\\n\\n\r\nTrigger is a studio known for always offering a high quality animation and Gridman is no exception, although it does have curious differences to the standard when we take notice that the main names of the studio are working on Promare leaving the door open for Amemiya and Hasegawa to do the least \"Trigger\" anime in the history of the Trigger studio. As one would expect the animation is incredible with great care in its scenarios, the action is dynamic with fluid and natural movements that complements the sample character of do not tell of the series, along with a cast of expressive characters that show a lot even in the scenes more silent, however where the average series of this studio would bet to do something bombastic, in Gridman is decided by a much more subtle and intriguing approach, using from the saturation of the light to represent the summer heat to static shots or irregular angles to generate anxiety to create a balance between the most mundane and human of the series with the supernatural of the Kaiju. Speaking of the Kaiju even though it may seem that making them in 3D is a strange decision when most of the elements in the series is 2D, however when we consider how to manage in this way to simulate the movements of a person in a complicated costume crushing a diorama, it can be seen that it is an alternative chosen to capture the originality style of the series.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the music and soundtrack of the series, Gridman surprises us by balancing the silence with energetic and positive songs for the action scenes together with much more classical or melancholic tunes, some themes seem straight out of the original series with that nineties style, but others take a much more electronic and modern way, but as strange as the mix seems, they never break with the atmosphere that the series wants to build. I recognize that out of a few issues like \"HumanLove\" that did not drastically alter the atmosphere, does not make them particularly memorable, however it is a soundtrack that deserves to be listened to separately since the work of Shiro Sagisu has no loss. The entry theme to the series is \"UNION\" of the Japanese duo OxT which perfectly represents the theme of youth in the series allowing to initiate in an energetic and optimistic way each episode, on the other hand the closing theme \"youthful beautiful\" of the singer Maaya Uchida, although she maintains the theme of youth, focuses more on being a quiet but energetic song about friendship that manages to fit more than well with the themes that the series wants to relate.\\n\\n\r\nSSSS.Gridman is by no means a perfect series, however, what series is it? Although it tried to reach viewers who do not know anything about the Ultra Series, a great fact that affects how you enjoy this series is if you can ignore the ridiculous / inherent kinkiness of the tokusatsu and if you are willing to follow the game of its narrative, since in the worst case it will seem like a boring work. However if you manage to connect with the story, this production, as I said at the beginning, is a tribute and a love letter to everything that makes the tokusatsu great and could easily enter the list of the best works of the Trigger studio.",

            "content": "To simplify things: what a majestic tribute to Tsuburaya Productions' 90's Denkou Choujin Gridman!\r\nMy first contact with Gridman was watching Superhuman Samurai, the American version. Back then I loved it but never thought about watching the original tokusatsu series because my SHS's memories were the best and I didn't want to ruin it. SSSS. Gridman came to fit my desire to know better the world from the original Japanese series and I decided to watch it for the nostalgia.\r\nSome elements surprised me a lot during the series. First was the development of the history that differs from the live-action tokusatsu \"rule\" of getting a newmonster per episode with minimum or no-story sustaining it. Although I think it is still a teen-series, it has a solid story! Another thing is THE REFERENCES! From Tsuburaya's Superheroes Universe and its monsters. From small lines to literally showing the figures and talking about Ultraman during some episodes - that's something you can only do when you are the owner of the show. You really feel you are watching a tokusatsu series. My third surprise was the amazing work from the guys at TRIGGER Studio to create a 3D that finally doesn't bother me AT ALL!!! Guys, please talk with the staff from \"Berserk\" to change things there for the next season!!! It's simply beautiful and fluid; all the fighting scenes are really really well choreographed and I have nothing but to be grateful for all the effort they put in it! Finally, the last half of the last episode that is just... please watch the series I guarantee that if you are a tokusatsu fan, you will enjoy it! Better get some information from the original series like watching the first episode at least to get a 100% full experience from the references SSSS. Gridman will show you.\\n\\n\r\nThat's it! Access Flash!!!",

I started it solely because people wouldn't stop talking about Rikka's thighs. I was very shocked at how well this show turned out, the characters were amazing and fun and I hope that we can see at least an OVA or Special for Gridman in the future!\r\nP.S I've seen a lot of theories about Rikka and Akane actually being the same person. Akane is actually Rikka in real life and so when Akane went into the digital world she created Rikka based on her own appearanceand then created herself based off what she thought a cute cool girl looked like. As much as this show was about Gridman fighting giant Kaiju, this show was also about learning to love yourself which is also why I think Rikka was designed to like Akane so much. She was trying to help Akane come to terms with herself and by the end of the show Akane was ready to leave the world that she created to grow on its own (hopefully Rikka x Yuta for my own sanity the yuri bait was strong in this one) and for her to get back to her own life and face things head on instead of hiding away.",

            "content": "SSSS Gridman is a pastiche of Tokusatsu media, transformers, and landmark mecha anime; framed in the skin of a reboot of a moderately successful live action Tokusatsu show. It's also an anime that excels in direction, shot composition and in the use of motifs. To the unassuming viewer, it's just another show that references other popular shows. But in the little details does it express it's own unique offerings, eventually surfacing in bombastic moments of action and character expression, often with brutal consequences. But it's biggest achievement is possibly questioning the very act of being in love with the media that is adores. Lets beclear, this is a show tailor made for the people who love the things the creators of this show adores and isn't for everyone.\\n\\n\r\nThe titular Gridman is a hero of all that is well and good. However this is not his story, rather it is the story of the villain. A rarity in the genre. But more on that later.\\n\\n\r\nFirst off on the technical side, Gridman excels at the use of clever shot composition and motif. Even unassuming scenes convey the state of minds of the characters that are a part of it. And in certain cases it cleverly hints towards the resolutions of the mysteries that the show presents at the beginning. Everything from the lyrics of it's opening, to the walk cycle of the kaiju Gridman fights against to every reference to other pop cultural works have a dual purpose. Speaking of those Kaiju fights, many of them are animated to imitate the way live action tokusatsu Kaiju move. This takes a bit of time to get used to, apparently both for the people who worked on it and the viewers as this aspect becomes even better integrated later on. The character designs are simple, iconic and tailored for both free flowing animation as well as powerful still shots. The soundtrack is muted for the most part but at points explodes but never forgets to become spine chilling when necessary. The voice acting goes for a more naturalistic tone, which once again feels out of place in a mecha anime, where over the top voice work is the norm. But this helps ground the characters are more vulnerably instead of powerful and heroic.\\n\\n\r\nAs a whole SSSS Gridman attempts to tell a story of how belief in the idea of heroism is important for a healthy mind. Characters in the series are rarely spared from trauma. But they are forced to live with it and accept it for what it is. Not everyone will be able to attain what they desire, regardless of how badly they want it and even in cases where much is sacrificed.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the main meat of SSSS Gridman, it's narrative or rather it's meta-narrative. It's rather difficult to explain without discussing spoilers so you have been warned. \\n\\n\r\nThe world of Gridman is not reality. It's a fictional world created as a coping mechanism by the \u201cvillain\u201d. However in spite of having utter control over reality that said character does not find solace. SSSS Gridman preaches that there is no happiness to be found in enclosing oneself in escapist thoughts. When minds are enclosed, our own thoughts start to betray us. Rather happiness it is a result of acceptance of reality. Escapist media exists as a powerful relief drug. But as always an over-reliance of such is harmful. Self harm is what draws in evil. And Gridman, the symbol of heroism, exists to drive it out by mending one's soul. Just as works of fiction acts as a brief moment of respite in our everyday life.",

            "content": "Note: SSSS.Gridman, as weird the name is, isn't a per se generic mecha anime. Don't complain, if you don't find what you were looking for.\r\nMany people(I should say men), as they claim to be, are here for a particular character's thighs or another character's boobs. Or for that big black tall shadowy villain who is intriguing if you'll pay attention to him.\r\nBut do read my review before you judge this animation for all that it is lacking. For I wish you all to see what this anime is actually all about.\r\nSSSS.Gridman is a tokusatsu love letter for the 90's live-action TV series of the samename. Tokusatsu is the Japanese name for the special effects. The most famous tokusatsu series will be Ultraman. That should give you an idea. Or you should check out Ultraman or a show with tokusatsu before diving into this series, if you wanna understand its true value.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, the people who have watched a lot of tokusatsu in their life, they are the best ones fit to give this review. And boy my childhood was filled with power rangers tokusatsu, which now makes me blush about it. A lot.\\n\\n\r\nNow this series has tried to replicate tokusatsu effects through its animation, and damn, they did that pretty successfully. Not only the effects, but they also tried to replicate the general tropes, the archetype characters and the lifeless villains who are being bad for sake of being bad.\\n\\n\r\nBut just copying isn't enough. They needed to own these stereotypes and boy did they perform an excellent job with that. I was genuinely shocked when they took some archetype filler episode stories and integrated them into the main arc, rather than the main character pointlessly keep on fighting for another 40 episodes like they do in the actual live-action series. And man, they were some sweet plot twists, which left me craving for more.\\n\\n\r\nYuuta, Hibiki and Rikka are three stereotypical main characters, which many claim are bland, dull and boring. To me, they weren't typical anime characters but typical characteristic human beings. To me, they were characters that were deep, grounded in reality and genuine. That instantly made me fall in love with this series.\\n\\n\r\nThe Gridman fights were stereotypical and they were good replicas of the live-action tokusatsu fights. Some might complain that the CGI stands out, but I think that was done on purpose. Cause tokusatsu fights are generally bad looking, if we look back to that time and review those shows with the present standards. And yep, these CGI fights look much better than those special effects.\\n\\n\r\nThis isn't just a love letter to tokusatsu, but a clever, recasted series to fit the generic anime we all love watching. Best elements of an Anime and tokusatsu were combined to create this masterpiece and considering the plot twists towards the end of the season, it leaves one on the edge of the seat, wanting for more. And it makes me wanna write a review on MAL, which I would typically never do.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, I would like to tell you that everything you dislike about this anime, there is actually a reasoning behind it. Just watch the whole series before you badmouth it. It will steal your heart, I promise you.",

Backgrounds are forgettable, I normaly don't put much judgment into backgrounds but Made in Abyss upped the bar.\r\nCharacters: BOOORING. None of the characters stand out and they have no goals or personality. the only thing differentiating them is their designs. Exeption is Shinjou who is slightly more memorable cause she actually has emotions.\r\nVA: Fantastic, Trigger never dissapoints with VA but it'sa shame the characters attached to them are so shit\\n\\n\r\nPlot: Honestly it was so uninteresting I dropped it after 2 eps so don't expect much accuracy from this section... \\n\\n\r\nMonsters/kaiju of \"unkown\" origin (somehow spawned via clay models created by antagonist(s) ) start attacking 'generic japanese metropolis #1145' and our MC fights them with a giant mecha suit. He polits via being transported into an old lookin PC in a garage and \"assisted\" by his not so friendly friends.

The effects are made to look like it could be done in an actual live action show with the Kajiu looking like costumes and also moving around like they have actors in them.\r\nThe story and sound have an eerie and mysterious atmospherearound them, it reminds me alot of evangelion when everything is quite and you just don't know exactly what's going on in the world of theirs as everything always feels slightly off...\\n\\n\r\nI personally really enjoy this show and feel like it is very much underrated on MAL as people seem to want a super complex anime even though it is supposed to represent some of the shows you watched as a kid that are made to be easy enough to follow",

            "content": "So this is actually my second review for this series now, with the last one at episode 4. 9 episodes in and this series has just gotten better and better with every progressing week. Quite a lot of shows have a strong start but slowly become shit overtime, but in Gridman's case it's the complete opposite-the show had a somewhat slow start(which turned people off) , but with every week as more and more stuff got revealed everything just became so good and so fantastic.\r\nQuick infodump: SSSS Gridman is NOT a mech series, but is based of the tokusatsu genre(stuff like the old Godzilla moviesand Power Rangers are all tokusatsu). \\n\\n\r\nSo, why should you watch Gridman? Well, I can just about sum it up in 4 points:\\n\\n\r\n1.CHARACTERS AND DIRECTION\\n\r\n Probably the thing which makes Gridman stand out the most from other anime is that the characters talk and behave the way NORMAL people do. The character interactions are probably the closest you'll get to actual Japanese high school students, and the dialogue is written very well. It's clear that TRIGGER wanted to make these characters seem as real and relatable as possible.(Don't listen to those weebs who are only used to the anime character cliches and pass these off as boring)\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing to notice about this show is the a lack of background music. I was always wondering why this show had such a real atmosphere to it and this was the answer; the BG OST's are instead replaced by the sounds of whats going on around them(passing cars outside, cicadas, students talking, etc etc)  instead of music for the sake of music. This adds such a surreal tone to the show, and makes it so good.Oh but the fights have good OSTs.\\n\\n\r\n2.THE STORY\\n\r\n Ok so when I started watching Gridman, I wasn't really expecting too much from the story. But this series fucked with my expectations completely, the story is phenomenal. There are quite a few plot twists which are well foreshadowed, and the plot always has this underlying sense of intrigue.\\n\\n\r\n3.ANIMATION\\n\r\n This series has some of the sexiest mech animation I've ever seen. Some of the CGI shots look GORGEOUS.\\n\\n\r\n4. thighs\\n\\n\\n\r\nSSSS Gridman is fantastic, definitely a must watch. Go check it out, you won't be disappointed\\n\\n\\n",

The combat scenes are done in a manner that accurately depicts what a fight like this would look like if you were filming men in rubber suits, and this was done for a very specific reason. \r\nThe villain in this show is my choice for villain of the year. They are deeply layered and interesting. The remaining cast, at least at first was really two dimensional at first. Gorgeous best friend next door. Nerdy buddy. Genericlove interest for the villain. This, once again, was done for a very specific reason.  However down the road, some of the rest of the cast grow into much deeper characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe setting of the show, is beautiful in it's emptiness and kaiju clouds in the background, which was done for a very specific reason. \\n\\n\r\nLook, SSSS.Gridman on it's surface is a fun giant monster/mecha anime, but there is a lot going on under the surface here.  This takes a fun show, and elevates it to brilliance. For you to totally know why, you'll have to give it a watch.  Trust me, you will not be disappointed. \\n\\n\r\nP.S. If you're still mad at Trigger for the end of Darling and the Franxx, they redeem themselves here. \\n\\n\r\nNow go watch this show!",

            "content": "While I am currently more of an anime fan, during my early years in secondary school, I was a massive Tokusatsu fan. Ultraman, Garo, Godzilla, Super Sentai, Kamen Rider, you name it. And I\u2019m still a fan of the genre. While I haven\u2019t seen as much of the latter two franchises nowadays (Mostly because Toei screwing everything up, to the point that I\u2019m not watching either of the currently airing series due to how unforgivably bad they\u2019ve been) the former two I still keep up with regularly, with me doing my best nowadays to keep up with Ultraman R/B (I need to find a decenttranslation for that show. But until then, I\u2019m happy to just finally be able to watch Ultraman Dyna) and watching the current Garo: Kami No Kiba series regularly and I have been watching the recent Godzilla movies (Shin Godzilla was awesome, by the way).\\n\\n\r\nSo where does this show fit in?\\n\\n\r\nWell, this requires a bit of explanation. In 1993, Tsubaraya Production (The Company that makes Ultraman) decided to test out some of their new digital equipment. Thus they created Denkou Choujin Gridman. It was a pretty decent show brought down only by repetition (Tsubaraya legitimately couldn\u2019t create an ongoing storyline to save their lives until Ultraman Gaia came along) and acting that\u2026 left a bit too be desired, even for the standards of the time.\\n\\n\r\nLater on, in 1994, around the time Gridman was ending, DIC (You know, the studio that screwed over Sailor Moon until VIZ came along?) decided to jump on the whole Power Rangers craze with two shows. The first one was Tattooed Teenage Alien Fighters From Beverly Hills. I hope the title alone is an indication of the show\u2019s quality. Anyhow, the second one was the one that actually matters for this review: Superhuman Samurai Syber-Squad. It was a standard adaptation of Gridman with the standard DIC changes, but at least they didn\u2019t have much to screw over this time around. So again, it was pretty decent all things considered. The only thing to note is that they somehow got Tim Curry of all people to voice the Big Bad. Now that is just awesome.\\n\\n\r\nJump ahead to 2015, Studio Trigger released a short named Denkou Choujin Gridman: Boys Invent Great Hero. In it, former villain turned good guy Takeshi from the original show, likely seeking for redemption, becomes a being known as Gridman Sigma to stop some Kaijus that had suddenly entered the real world. None of this is actually important plot-wise to what I\u2019m about to talk about, but it\u2019s still worth mentioning.\\n\\n\r\nSo, in 2018, Trigger released their own Gridman series, SSSS. Gridman. A reimagining of the original series (Well, sorta, but that would mean dwelling into spoilers). So, let\u2019s not waste any more time and see what this show has in store.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nAlready, this show reminds me of Ultraseven X, a reimagining of the original Ultraseven series (Again, sorta), what with our main character having amnesia. This could however be excused by both shows having the same writer, however (Yeah, they actually got long-time Heisei Era Ultraman writer Hasegawa Keiichi to write this show). In fact, now that I think about it, this show becomes kinda predictable if you\u2019re used to Hasegawa\u2019s writing style.\\n\\n\r\nAlso as you\u2019d expect from Hasegawa, the show takes its sweet time actually explaining what the hell is going on. They don\u2019t even tell us where our cast is until literally the halfway point. It\u2019s one of the few complaints I actually have for him as a writer.\\n\\n\r\nEverything else though is great. While the mystery takes way too long to be solved, it is actually a very interesting mystery, and I\u2019ll admit there was one twist I didn\u2019t see coming in the slightest. Overall, it\u2019s a good story all around, so I don\u2019t know what else to say, really.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThey certainly are a colorful bunch. Hibiki Yuta, our hero, is just a standard Toku protagonist, but I\u2019ll give him credit for actually acting his age, something many other shows have failed to do. I was definitely more of a fan of his friends, Utsumi Shou and Takarada Rikka. Utsumi is a gloriously adorkable fanboy of the Ultra Series that honestly kinda reminds me of myself. Rikka, on the other hand, is more aloof and reserved, but she is likable enough for me to support her.\\n\\n\r\nHowever the really important ones are the villains, led by Shinjo Akane. This girl is basically what would happen if Suzumiya Haruhi became aware of her God powers and grew a God Complex to match it. Her slow decent into despair was honestly the best part of the show. That\u2019s not to say the other two major villains are bad either. Alexis Kerib is just a joy to watch. He\u2019s so polite that, even though you know he\u2019s faking it, you can\u2019t help but like him. Anti is pretty good too. He reminds me a lot of Graphite from Kamen Rider Ex-Aid, except far more developed (Not to say Graphite was a bad character, mind you).\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast is good too, but I don\u2019t have much to say about them.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\\n\r\nThe show looks amazing. Every character looks distinct from each other, and you can get a hint of their personalities through their looks alone. Of course the real highlights are the fight scenes. Even once you take aside the countless references to mecha anime found in them (I noticed both a Macross Missile Massacre and the Obari Pose and I\u2019m pretty sure I missed a lot too) they do a wonderful job of translating the feel you usually get from watching people in rubber suits fight each other. Overall, this show looks fantastic.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is honestly kinda forgettable. None of it is terrible, but it honestly just kinda blends into the background. The only exception is the Opening \u201cUnion\u201d, which is pretty good. I will however admit I kinda fanboyed when \u201cYume No Hero\u201d began playing in the final battle.\\n\\n\r\nVoice Acting:\\n\\n\r\nThe Voice Acting is pretty good. Of course, Midorikawa Hikaru comes back to voice Gridman and he does a fantastic job as he always does. I don\u2019t know much about Hibiki\u2019s Seiyuu, Hirose Yuuya, but I think he did a pretty good job. Ueda Reina and Suzumura Kenichi also did a pretty great job as Anti and Akane, especially Ueda. And of course, there\u2019s the ever awesome Inada Tetsu as Alexis, who\u2019s just as glorious as you\u2019d expect. The rest do a good job too, from Yuuki Aoi, Matsukaze Masaya (Who, fun fact, used to be a Tokusatsu Actor best known for playing Mega Blue in Denji Sentai Megaranger before becoming a Seiyuu through Shenmue), Shintani Mayumi and, of all people, Konishi Katsuyuki. In general, this is a pretty good cast.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nWhile SSSS. Gridman is not perfect, its heart is clearly in the right place. It\u2019s a love letter to fans of this classic character and to a cult classic. If you were a fan of either Denkou Choujin Gridman or Superhuman Samurai Syber-Squad, I implore you to watch this show. It\u2019s probably one of the best animes to have come out this year.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 8/10",

            "content": "What in the world.....? A question that I've been asking myself ever since I started watching SSSS.Gridman. From the first, to the last episode. It has been a journey that I never expected, but am grateful to have undergone. Finally, after completing it though, I now have the answer to that question....\r\nBecause Trigger.\r\nPlease, do yourself a favor, and watch this anime.\r\nOn the surface, this anime looks like it's about giant mecha battles with Kaiju. Your standard run-of-the-mill Ultraman series type of thing. I can assure you that this cover is simply used to hide the true nature of the story. It is one that isslowly revealed in the most unnatural, yet fascinating way that I have ever seen. You will be puzzled as to what on earth is going on in this anime, and slightly put off by how unnatural everything seems. Yet, I can assure you, please do not drop this series. It will pay off, and it does so big time.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound are at a good quality. One fit for a series about mechs beating the living daylights out of kaiju while shouting out the name of the special move they used. It is very stylistic, which I personally liked.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all so mysterious. I wanted to know more about everyone, and the anime does deliver in on this. Plus, this one anime has two possible best girls of the season, all in one package! How could you not watch it?\\n\\n\r\nApart from that, the character designs were distinct and vivid. Each character seemed to have been created with much care. Perhaps the average viewer, upon watching this anime, might not notice it, but just take a look at all the fan art that has spawned from this anime, and you'll see how much artists love these characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it was a confusing, yet strangely compelling experience that I don't regret having. I have so many questions, yet I feel satisfied for some odd reason. It's truly hard to describe how this anime made me feel, since the mixture was unlike anything that I've experienced before. The only way to make you understand it, is for you to watch it yourself.\\n\\n\r\nNow go. Go and enjoy watching SSSS.Gridman.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading this review, and I hope you have a wonderful day!",

            "content": "SSSS Gridman is fun... there really isn\u2019t much else to say. The show\u2019s got a Saturday morning, Pokemon-in-pyjamas vibe that takes me right back to my childhood and does what a lot of other anime fail to do; be something I want to watch. Apart from all that, the show features and pretty likeable cast of heroes for us to root for and a central mystery that \u2013 especially with this last episode \u2013 has me excited to keep watching (I mean, the show\u2019s basically power rangers meets the matrix at this point and who can say no to that). \r\nThis show largely hinges onthe kaiju. As it is said \u201cthey are the main characters\u201d. With that in mind, I think the first episode is pretty brilliant all that numbing build-up \u2013 that sense of weekend morning calm \u2013 bursts into a shower of roars and screams as a creature that looks and feels (because of the CG) like an over worldly force, completely incongruous with the misty setting. The appearance of the first kaiju is brilliantly executed in a way that made me root for the characters and cheer when they succeed like I rarely do.\\n\r\nSo, to all those people who say its boring, i can't help the feeling that you're just impatient - i mean I'm not saying, \"wait till episode 26 it gets good I sear!\" - but its a nice, fifteen or so minute ride till the shit hits the fan and with all the cute designs, likable characters and hints of greater mystery, how could you not like it.",

Then this anime will feel you with nostalgic for sure and giveyou something new to walk away from as well so I suggest you watch it and see for yourself.",

Its funny to see how bad the anime is and thats wht this anime slightly watchable",

            "content": "The title sure is something, I guess.\r\n~ SSSS.Gridman\r\nYuuta wakes up with no memory and is capable of seeing things that other can't. He can see giant kaiju, which are all over the city. There are two other people he hangs out with. Rikka and Utsumi. When a kaiju attacks the city, Gridman calls for him and they combine in order to save the day.\r\nGiant robots fighting kaiju. Every single episode. It's repetitive, but Gridman has some nice power-ups and there are various unique kaiju, so that makes it less boring to watch. Plus there's Anti. More about him later.\r\nMost of the characters are pretty blandand uninteresting. Yuuta Hibiki is the protagonist and he has a case of \"amnesia\". Also, he has a crush on Rikka. That's it. The show gives us a reason as to why he's so bland, but I don't think it's a good excuse. The only thing I know about Rikka is that she's a very caring person, seeing as she's willing to help Anti, although she doesn't know anything about him. She also cares about every person in the city and doesn't want anything bad to happen to any of them. That's fine and all, but I feel like they could have done much more with her character and even when they tried to do something, they failed. More about Rikka later. Utsumi is Yuuta's nerdy friend who loves mecha and kaiju. He also has a crush on Akane. That's it. The show actually does something with his character nearing the end, with him realizing that it's not all fun and games and that people are actually dying. I guess that's fine, but couldn't they have done more with him? Same goes with Gridman and his four allies. They were all lackluster characters. Bor spent most of her time kicking other characters in their legs. That's all I can remember about them.\\n\\n\r\nNow we have Anti, a character that actually managed to grow on me. What exactly did I like about Akane's failed creation? Anti is another one of Akane's kaiju, but he's a special kind of Kaiju. He has a human form and is intelligent . . . well, sort of. His sole purpose is to destroy Gridman and even after suffering constant defeat, he never gives up. He hates Gridman more than Akane. \\n\r\nI couldn't help but feel sorry for him. Akane treats him like thrash and doesn't even look after him. While he's not busy fighting Gridman, he's always seen scavenging for food and living on the streets, because Akane doesn't feed him or provide him with a place where he can stay. He doesn't understand basic concepts and lacks basic knowledge, such as parents, school, what an apology is, . . . What he does understand, however, is loyalty. He's still loyal to Akane even though she doesn't care about him. Also, destroying Gridman is all he can think about, so long as he doesn't have an empty stomach. Honestly, his entire existence is just depressing and seeing how Akane treats him made me hate her. Sure, killing people I don't know anything about because of petty reasons and ruining events, just because you don't like them is pretty psychotic, but treating your loyal servant like garbage? That's what really made me hate her.\\n\r\nAnti doesn't stay the same forever. They actually did something great with him and I loved the way he turned out as a character.\\n\\n\r\nAs previously mentioned, most of the characters are terrible. What actually got me to continue watching the show was the mystery behind it. I was curious and wanted answers, but sadly, what the show gave me was a mixed bag of ideas and concepts that are either flawed, poorly presented or unexplored.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some points that I want to make about Akane. She's a very sensitive character, who also happens to be a god and a seriously flawed one at that. She's straight up psychotic. If there's a person she doesn't like, she kills them. Her reasons for wanting to kill people are nothing short of petty. Some of the city will be destroyed in the process, but it doesn't matter, since she's capable of rebuilding the city overnight while also erasing every person's memory of what happened. A \"reset\" if you will. She wants to destroy Gridman, because he's preventing her from destroying the things and people she doesn't like.\\n\\n\r\nThere are things that just puzzle me about her. \\n\r\nWhy doesn't Akane just make it so that the things she doesn't like don't exist in her city? Why doesn't she just make it so that people don't do things that annoy her? She clearly has the power to do it and Rikka is proof of it.\\n\r\nHer powers as a god aren't portrayed well at all. She just makes the kaiju and an alien brings them to life. That's it.\\n\\n\r\nThe show eventually reveals to us that Rikka, although being a very bland and uninteresting character, actually does have something quite interesting about her. Too bad they messed it up. Akane went out of her way to explain Rikka's existence to her, but nothing happened. Hearing something like that should seriously make a person think and reflect on things, but I felt no impact or change in Rikka's character. She doesn't seem to ever debate or question herself or her own existence. I mean, I can't blame her for not changing her view of Akane (I understand her perfectly, but I can't explain in greater detail, because of spoilers), I really  can't, but I couldn't help but feel like they could have made it more meaningful or impactful. I understand that Rikka wished to reconnect with Akane, but it didn't make me feel anything.  \\n\\n\r\nThe show reveals to us that there are other kaiju, who weren't born from Akane, but doesn't do anything with that idea. A kaiju appears in order to explain things to Yuuta and that's all.\\n\\n\r\nWhere do Gridman and his allies come from? Why is Gridman inside of an old computer? How is Akane a god?\\n\\n\r\nThe ending gives us an answer to several questions, but seriously? The contents of this show can be interpreted as Akane's mind battling depression. Alexis is leading her astray and making sure she stays depressed, Gridman represents her desire to move forward, etc. I can understand why she's a god, that's all fine and well, but that doesn't excuse the show's other flaws.\\n\\n\r\n~ Overall, studio Trigger could have done better. I really liked Anti, though.",

            "content": "Godzilla represented the fears and destruction of nuclear weapons, so what if a lonely human created kaiju, then what do these human created kaiju represent for the one that created it?\r\nSSSS.Gridman is something like a modern retelling of the 1993 Gridman the Hyper Agent tokusatsu series. SSSS.Gridman follows Yuta Hibiki voiced by Yuuya Hirose having woken up with amnesia but later on told by Gridman voiced by Hikaru Midorikawa on an old computer screen that he has a purpose, with his friends Rikka Takarada voiced by Yume Miyamoto, Akane Shinjou voiced by Reina Ueda and Shou Utsumi voiced by Souma Saitou to help him out,until the kaiju's appeared...\\n\\n\r\nSome Spoilers Ahead...\\n\\n\r\nNow LA really doesn't watch tokusatsu series but was mildly interested in Power Rangers at one point or another, but nonetheless the basic premise is nearly the same as it's 1993 counterpart, but where SSSS.Gridman is different is where one certain character just changes up the formula of what would be a typical \"monster of the week\" serial, that being Akane Shinjou. \\n\\n\r\nSSSS.Gridman has two main plotlines that it goes throughout the anime, one of Yuta and how he is linked with Gridman, the other of Akane Shinjou herself. Yuta's story is mainly fixated on his amnesia and who he is which coupled with his friends interactions and the strange instances of the city and it's people \"resetting\" as it were to piece together why the kaiju appears and that answer comes in Akane Shinjou, see Akane Shinjou is shown VERY early on that she's not the typically nice genki girl, as she's the one creating the kaiju for her own personal reasonings, some for the mildest of indiscretions and tries killing them. The typical monster of the week plays out for the both Yuta and Akane with Akane closing in who Gridman really is and Yuta closing in as to the strange incidents being linked to Akane in the process. There is one chaos factor as it were and that is Anti voiced by Kenichi Suzumura, a kaiju made human having a vendetta against Gridman and something of a repeatable monster that Gridman and Yuta fights often within the anime and he later get major character development on it's existence as a human-kaiju.\\n\\n\r\nYuta's plotline IS interesting as it ties up loose ends as ti were, but the downsides are that Yuta is something of a doe-eyed main male protagonist with his amnesia NOT helping matters and he's a little bit dense but not too dense as it were which is probably helped with the Neon Genesis Junior Highschool Students (yes really that's their group name), 4 suited mysterious people who give Gridman different transformations and this being adapted from a tokusatsu series, YUP Gridman can combine with them. Anyways the Neon Genesis Junior Highschool Students are like the voice of reason to Yuta as well as Utsumi and Rikka in many ways and it's because of their involvement they make things interesting to say the least, not only because of Gridman's fancy new weapons but with the character interactions, LA's favourite Neon Genesis Junior Highschool Student being Borr voiced by Aoi Yuuki, for having the Macross Missile Massacre installment but also for her brash personality. With favourites, LA's favourite character would definitely be Rikka Takarada as her personality and involvement in the anime was just interesting compared to Yuta and Utsumi, though Utsumi was something of a audience surrogate, especially towards the tokusatsu fans.\\n\\n\r\nNow for Akane, the MOST interesting character of the anime, with Akane able to create kaiju it embodies her desires and feelings as it were, she is something of a god as it were and the dynamic of her obsession with kaiju and making friends comes full circle for LA when it compares to Yuta's situation of being the \"hero\" that fights against the kaiju, as it were dispelling the negative emotions Akane creates with the kaiju in the city. For LA's interpretation, Akane WANTS to have friends as it were and she is already popular but with her being a god, is her being popular is fake due to how she orchestrated it all and she's creating kaiju not only because it's something she likes to do but to also get Rikka to truly be her friend in the process?, as both of them share a great deal of screentime together. There's also the notion of the \"god complex\" as her having a world all to herself, she one, can't handle the outliers and two, her personality leads herself into almost self-destructive state that she would rather destroy it all, not helped by Alexis Kerib voiced by Tetsu Inada the bigger bad as it were. Akane is a pretty complex and interesting character and bringing up that Akane is the Big Bad very early on was refreshing and different to say the least and what they do with her later on and thoroughly commit to this was executed excellently.\\n\\n\r\nSSSS.Gridman's animation is impressive to say the least and from Trigger along with Tsuburaya Productions who does special effects on tokusatsu shows, this to be expected, with many of the kaiju battles being 3DCGI but used excellently well and the motions and choreography being somewhat intentional to harken back to the old tokusatsu series but still the level of animation was amazingly done. Character designs are vibrant and interesting looking, with standouts from Akane, Borr, Anti and Rikka to say a few. Trigger and Tsuburaya Productions did amazingly well to modernize a tokusatsu into anime format with detailed background work, character designs and those awesome CGI Gridman vs. kaiju fights were the icing on the cake. Expected Trigger but also major props to Tsuburaya Productions for making the CGI seamless to the traditional animation done with Trigger.\\n\\n\r\nAs for voice acting, well LA will commend Reina Ueda as she once again for LA has been typecasted but exceedly typecasted well as Akane, in voicing another \"genki character with bloody steel\"-type characters (the other one LA can remember is \u03bc from Caligula) but seriously Reina Ueda easily earns LA's MVP award in terms of voicing acting as she went all out with this role. The rest of the voice cast were great as well, from Yume Miyamoto as Rikka who had some great emotional range, Kenichi Suzumura as Anti, sounding like a semi-hyped Accelerator most of the time and Hikaru Midorikawa as Gridman for the name attacking moments which SSSS.Gridman does OFTEN. What can LA say a great voice cast!\\n\\n\r\nSSSS.Gridman gives us two spices as it were with either one pleasing, if you want to see kaiju fights then get your adrenaline pumped for that with it's amazingly done animation work done by Trigger and Tsuburaya Productions, but if you want intrigue, character development and interestingly drastic changes to the plot that accompanies the kaiju fights then that will satisfy  you as well, SSSS.Gridman does have some weakness with both these plotlines converging of course, that of our main protagonist may not be a bit bland with Rikka and Utsumi taking up the slack but that's a small flaw to what is a great anime celebrating tokusatsu in all it's CGI glory.\\n\\n\r\nThank You Gridman and welcome to the Melancholy of Akane Shinjou",

The art style is beautiful and the colors are really nice.They use a cgi when there are battles witch gives you a nostalgic throwback to the 2005 era of mecha and in the same time they manage to fit it surprisingly well with the overall art style.The story at first glance may look generic and nothing to special but as theanime continuous the story gets better.The show has some good characters and some that they could have had a better development.\\n\r\nOverall SSSS Gridman is an amazing anime and i highly recommend it not only to the mecha fans but also to the ones who are not really interested on  mechas.",

            "content": "Trigger's gayest anime to date is still not gay enough. \r\nThe parts of the show that interest me are often given a back seat to archetypes and themes already explored in other shows. Yuta is a precious boy and all but he really isn't all that interesting, his situation not withstanding.\r\nRikka often picks up the slack of the protagonist and her relationship with Akane is the absolute narrative crowning jewel of the show. I am almost starved for more interaction and information from them. While the romantic tension between them is there I wish it were less vague. There was a great opportunity to voiceLGBT representation and Trigger merely gave a timid squeak. There are other characters who are super interesting, but in my opinion not all are quite utilized to their full potential. One stand out being the Kaiju with intelligence\\n\\n\r\nI loved the heavy atmosphere of the toned down moments where the characters are allowed to shine, as well as the show's use of silence conversationally to emphasize certain moments for humor or drama.\\n\\n\r\nThe other draw is, of course, the massive kaiju mecha fights which are quite impressive and original for the Genre, using some impressive cg animation to invoke a guy in a rubber suit was both refreshing and nostalgic at the same time. The designs of them were all great, however,  I wish the design of the Alien character had a less generic \"trigger/gainax\" look to him. it felt like he had no personality of his own.\\n\\n\r\nFor better or for worse there's pretty much no other show like this and despite its flaws I definitely think it's worth a shot.",

It is not the classic episodic enemy kind of story. It is really complex in the background, with a clear inspiration of series like Evangelion (is Trigger... you know...).\r\nThe only bad points on the story is that only if you have seen the original 90's Gridman live action, you will be capable of understanding all the glory and implications of the end.\r\nStory: 8\r\nArt: Impressive, the designs are very good, the characters, the Kaijus, GridmanItself. All of them are cool. The animation is really good with the usual Trigger Style that some people love and other ones hate. The battles can be a bit more dynamic but they are very good battles. And can we talk about the references? HOLY S$#T there are a lot of references. From other animes to Tokusatsu classic series. What a good time i have looking for all the references. And a good one for all you to know: Rikka's mother has the same face of Haruko from FLCL and THE SAME SEIYUU! What an amazing touch right there! \\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\\n\r\nSound: very good, the music is good, it feels out of place in some parts, and then you remember is Trigger (you know...trigger...gainax...Evangelion...) so in the end is quite an experience. In some parts i really began to expect a battle with beethoven music. The opening and ending are good, the opening specially made me feel like watching and old Tokusatsu series so it really achieve the objective. \\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: This is the low point of the series, the characters lack with their personalities. At some point i stopped caring about the characters and just wait for the next amazing battle, Anti is by far the most interesting character of the series. And the only one i really cared to find out his true motivations.\\n\r\nCharacters: 7\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: If you are a Tokusatsu fan, this anime touch the line of the very very good anime. I enjoyed the battles a lot. To the point of watching the entire anime in less than half a day. So if you are fan of trigger or Tokusatsu this is a highly recommended series, every episode will let you with hunger of more. If not, it is still a good mecha vs kaiju style of anime for you to watch.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8",

            "content": "I often want to call Darling in the Franxx disappointing, but that isn't entirely true. I suspected I might not like it quite early on. SSSS.Gridman had a lot of baggage to overcome. Unlike with Franxx, this was a solo project for Trigger. That boded well for me, but I still had a certain fear that the roots of the company would shine through and we'd end up with another mech-Gainax-wannabe. With both series, I went in not knowing anything except the studio information. And while Franxx was a struggle for me to sift through, SSSS.Gridman kept me binge-watching once it had finished airing. Itwas everything I never knew I wanted. \\n\\n\r\nI think that what I really loved about this show is that it knew its predecessors. Often with shows like Franxx, Attack on Titan, or Sword Art Online, they try to brand themselves as very individual and erase the ancestor-like material. Gridman never pretended to be a hot, fresh take on the mech genre. It dutifully paid homage to the roots of mech pop culture. The art and sound were very impressive to me, and while it wasn't the new Evangelion, the atmosphere of it was extremely captivating. To me, it was like an 80s-90s experience but dressed up in a 2018 style. It was nostalgic and refreshing compared to more mass-produced trending shows. \\n\\n\r\nI haven't written many reviews on anime, because I tend to find them ranging from unnecessary to obnoxious. Generally, there tends to be a massive discourse surrounding certain shows. Whether I agree or disagree, I don't value arguing about anime on the internet. Gridman isn't trying to be a massive statement though. That's why I am so thrilled to make my own statements about it. \\n\\n\r\nI think it's okay that a lot of people weren't enthused with Gridman. Gridman isn't here to capture a massive wave of praise. What it does do, I believe it does well. For the 12 episodes I spent watching it, I was a kid again, experiencing science fiction shows for the first time. It is one of the purest watching experiences that I've had in a while. For people who don't value the same things as me or value them differently, this show was just another drop in the massive bucket of anime. But for me, it was a moment to reflect on what has never ceases to make me smile.",

            "content": "SSSS.Gridman is an anime modernization of the tokusatsu genre, in the same vein as shows like Ultraman and Super Sentai, and it manages to do this shockingly well. My personal experience with the genre is essentially just seeing a few episodes of Power Rangers as a kid, which I never really cared for, so I was pleasantly surprised by just how much I ended up enjoying this show. I picked up Gridman mostly because of Trigger being the studio behind this entry in the series and the teaser trailer they put out after it's announcement alongside Promare (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGw4SmxkryU) which led me to believe this couldbe a slightly darker take on the genre with the same action and story elements. This assumption was partially true.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is solid, especially for it's genre as plot normally takes a back seat for dramatic action sequences, but I feel like Gridman does a respectable job of balancing story and action. There are some well thought out twists which you can probably predict well in advance if you are observant but are still satisfying, and much of the final few episodes is focused on character analysis and introspection. After the first two or three episodes my expectations for a mature super robot series were deflated since most of the beginning is a parade of monster fights with little bearing on the plot, so it was enjoyable to see the show shift its focus to plot and character development while still keeping up the one-fight-per-episode pace.\\n\\n\r\nGridman's art is generally quite good, most notably with inventive use of 3D CGI to replicate the old rubber suit fights which have been a staple of the genre since its very beginning. The fights themselves look fantastic with a lot of dynamic movement and flashy action sequences. Transformation sequences, of which there are quite a few, are a little long but they are suitably cool and it's awesome seeing Gridman and his various forms drawn out alongside the 3D models used for most of the fighting scenes. The character designs look fine and are nothing particularly interesting but consistently pretty high quality regardless of the scene. However, the mech and kaiju designs are all excellent and look really cool no matter what they're doing, and there's always a lot of emphasis on making their size seem massive and real against the backdrop of their environment. Background art is good across the board with lots of little details and looks really nice in quite a few shots throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nSound design is really good. All the mech and kaiju noises fit perfectly and are exactly as loud and weighty as they should be, and the accompanying environment sounds during the fight scenes fit well. The music is also generally good, some tracks are awesome. The OP and ED are both real ear worms.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters were the weakest part of the entire show for me. Most of the cast are very flat and underdeveloped, and there's kind of an in-universe explanation as to why this is though it still makes for a weaker viewing experience, but the characters who are given ample screen time and exploration of their motives are actually really interesting and I would have loved to have more of the main cast fleshed out in the same ways. It's a shame that this show didn't have a longer run or dedicate a little more time to a lot of the major characters, but I'm also glad it's only 12 episodes because it doesn't overstay it's welcome or get padded out with pointless filler like many other Trigger shows have.\\n\\n\r\nIn all, I found myself having a lot of fun with Gridman. I never expected to get much enjoyment out of something in this genre because of previous experience with it, but this show is so well done that I couldn't help but smile when the good guys win and the major plot moments were meaningful to me, I'm even a little interested in checking out the rest of the franchise because of the way it was tied in with this series. It absolutely deserves a watch.",

It was great in the beginning and slowly got worse until the end where it all crashed and burned. Overall I found Darling in the Franxx to be really good. The production was fantastic all the way through, the characters were great and the story was also really good until the halfway point. But it's hard to ignore that ending. Trigger really needed to shape up to not lose its reputation. \r\nAnd in a way, SSSS.Gridman was the exact opposite of Franxx for me. Let me explain:\r\nIn the same waythat I liked Franxxs beginning more than ending, I liked SSSS.Gridmans ending more than beginning. I haven't rewatched the episodes, so I don't know if there was information that could have been interesting after watching everything. But it felt like every episode was: A kaiju appears > The gang can't get to Gridman/They can't kill the Kaiju > They figure out a plan, and they kill the kaiju\\n\\n\r\nAgain, maybe I missed foreshadowing that could have been interesting. But I don't think you should write an episode of a show so that people who have already watched it think it's interesting. Cause if new people find that boring, no one will get to the ending. \\n\r\nMaybe that's just my opinion though.\\n\\n\r\nBut around episode 6, something happened. It instantly got more interesting. It was the episode where we are introduced to a new character (I won't say who for the sake of spoilers) who explain a little more about the antagonist. But it didn't feel like they explained it to the audience. More like the Protagonist needed information that she could give. And after that episode, the quality just flew up. The characters got a lot more development, especially the antagonist. The story got more interesting. It was pretty amazing. \\n\\n\r\nAnd now everything is finished, and I haven't rated it higher than Franxx. Mainly because of the characters. I know I said that they got a lot of development in the second half, but not enough IMO. The more memorable characters were the antagonist, Akane, and one the of main characters, Rikka. They both had inner fears and insecurities. They did bad things, they did good things. They were very interesting. And even though the rest of the cast were fine, they weren't nearly as good as those two. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSo at the end of the day, I liked this show less than Franxx. It wasn't bad, it wasn\u00e4t even average. It just didn't beat the thing it tried to beat.\\n\\n\r\nA solid 7/10",

            "content": "You know, at some point we\u2019re really going to have to retire the meme of Studio Trigger supposedly \u201csaving\u201d anime every time it puts out a production. Yes, I was as blown away by Kill la Kill as everyone else, and the studio\u2019s resolute embrace of the creative, freeform ethos of classic anime (especially its roots in the Gainax style of aesthetic as narrative) makes it arguably the strongest keeper of anime\u2019s history today. But just because its creative process is steeped in tradition and it\u2019s one of the few animation houses regularly putting out original works at a far higher rate than adaptations doesn\u2019tmake it the best or most important studio, and it certainly doesn\u2019t give it the exclusive keys to anime\u2019s future. Lest we forget, the year that Kill la Kill supposedly saved anime for the first time was the same year that Attack on Titan blew the medium\u2019s relative profile into the stratosphere like never before, easily eclipsing any negligible impact Ryuko and Senketsu had on the broader popular culture. Trigger is a studio like any other, as capable of succeeding or failing as the likes of Bones, Madhouse, A1 Pictures, Production IG, and all the rest. Perhaps it may at one point in the future create a story worthy of this hyperbolic praise, something that truly changes the anime landscape for the better as opposed to just helping carve out its own little eclectic niche. But it isn\u2019t going to be this year, and it isn\u2019t going to be with SSSS.Gridman.\\n\\n\r\nSSSS.Gridman is a particularly difficult show to talk about, because it\u2019s a show where the long con of figuring out exactly what you\u2019ve gotten yourself into is very much part of the point, and it\u2019s nearly impossible to get into the details of what that entails without slipping into spoiler territory. From the first episode, it\u2019s clear that there\u2019s a far bigger picture at play than what we\u2019re immediately made aware of, and it asks us to stick with it as it slowly lays all its cards down on the table. Yuta Hibiki wakes up with no memories of who he used to be, in a city where giant kaiju are part of the skyline. In absence of answers, he tries to fit normally back into his daily life, going to school and reconnecting with his friends. But it quickly becomes apparent that there is trouble afoot: kaiju have begun materializing within the city to wreak havoc, and the only one who can stop them is Gridman, a classic tokusatsu-style giant robot who Yuta is somehow able to connect with through a broken-down computer. Thus, it\u2019s off to the races as Yuta and his friends tackle a series of weekly invasions by giant monsters, and the show only lets you get comfortable with that monster-of-the-week dynamic long enough to yank it out from under you as it starts pulling the mask off and revealing what it\u2019s really about.\\n\\n\r\nI won\u2019t get into any explicit spoilers, but safe to say there is a lot going on underneath the surface here, a sprawling network of ideas and themes weaving in and out of each other connecting to what exactly the kaiju are, where they\u2019re coming from, and what it even means to be fighting them. There are a million different ideas bouncing around, a million little details hinting at the big picture lurking just beyond the horizon... and in a way, that ends up doing more harm than good. The show demands a lot of trust from you as its setting up its dominoes, giving you little teases of its master plan to keep you invested in finding out the truth. But it runs into an issue that a lot of similar puzzle-box narratives run into: it isn\u2019t quite sure how to keep things engaging while it\u2019s still teasing out all the details. The early few episodes of this show are honestly kind of uninteresting once the initial intrigue of the premise wears off; neither Yuta nor either of his friends are interesting enough on their own to wring real dramatic stakes out of, nor memorable enough personalities to coast by on the strength of their banter and interactions. In absence of finding any truly interesting directions to take them in, we\u2019re pretty much just stalling for time until the show can get where it\u2019s going and give something of substance to get attached too. And even by the end, none of these characters end being textured or engaging enough to warrant hanging the story off of them.\\n\\n\r\nBut therein lies the clever little trick that clicks into place once Gridman finally stops playing coy; this isn\u2019t actually the story of three kids using a giant robot to fight giant monsters. Again without getting too spoiler-y, it\u2019s actually the story of their opponent, the person making the kaiju in the first place. And while the Gridman Alliance, as they come to call themselves, don\u2019t have that much going on, the story of their classmate Akane Shinjo (who is revealed to be the kaiju\u2019s creator in the second episode, so that\u2019s not much of a spoiler) ends up packing some real goddamn punch. It\u2019s in her that Gridman reveals its true game plan, and the result is a fascinating, almost abstract at times exploration of the human psyche that feels like a truer successor to Evangelion\u2019s crown of philosophical robot-punching than pretty much every other pretender to the throne that\u2019s cropped up in the past two decades. Not many stories I\u2019ve seen have pulled off the \u201cantagonist is actually the protagonist\u201d switcharoo as well as this one does, and I just wish the show trusted itself enough not to leave that thread dangling for so long without much of interest to pass the time until it was ready to reveal its hand. The resonance of the later episodes really does end up throwing the emptiness of the early episodes into even greater relief; there really had to be a more efficient way to sneak in this genuinely great story without making the hook to its eventual reveal so lacking.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a damn good thing, then, that the production as a whole does its best to make up the difference and keep the proceedings from slipping into outright boredom while the story is still hemming and hawing en route to its destination. The Evangelion comparison I made earlier wasn\u2019t just for lack of a more original comparison point; Gridman\u2019s direction really does call back to it, using a lot of atypical shot compositions and heavily moody, off-kilter editing to leave you in a constant sense of unease. This is a show where there\u2019s always something important happening on screen, always an important piece of information being conveyed by the cinematic language, and it helps keep your eyes glued to the screen lest you miss something important. And when the action kicks up for the big kauji battles, Trigger\u2019s willingness to push boundaries truly shines through; this might genuinely be some of the best CG I\u2019ve seen in an otherwise traditionally animated show, using the medium\u2019s unique properties to give its titanic combatants a real sense of weight and momentum. You can tell how much love Gridman has for the tokusatsu series that inspired it; almost any one of these battles could easily be recreated by a pair of actors in rubber suits, save for the chaotic whirlwind of cool-ass street debris these lumbering titans kick up with every step.\\n\\n\r\nBut I think this show\u2019s real secret weapon is its cast; where the writing leaves Yuta and his friends distressingly bland, their voice actors do a hell of a job wrangling some genuine depth into their empty shells. Relative newcomer Yume Miyamoto, in particular, is really goddamn fantastic as Yuta\u2019s friend Rikka Tarakada, capturing a kind of lived-in, weary teenage authenticity that feels as immediately star-making as Tomoyo Kurosawa\u2019s similarly grounded turn as Kumiko Oumae in Sound Euphonium. Ditto Reina Ueada as Akane, delivering a performance that feels like emotional razor wire bleeding itself raw in poignant gashes. Forget the discussion around thicc thighs and big breasts that\u2019s dominated the conversation surrounding this show; these two ladies\u2019 best assets are the stirring power of their voices, a glimpse of the beating heart that I wish we could\u2019ve seen more of. I wanted this entire story to be as good as when these two interact. I wanted every character feel as genuine as the connection built just through their performances. Gridman had the potential to be not just good, not just great, but genuinely special in a way that might have actually earned the \u201csaving anime\u201d moniker. And against all that, having to just settle for \u201cgood\u201d feels like a waste.\\n\\n\r\nAnd yet, Gridman is still good. It\u2019s lumpy and lopsided and takes far too long to get to the point, but once it gets there, the result is really kickass, really touching, and really goddamn powerful. The journey absolutely has its rough spots, but the destination is well worth it.",

            "content": "Gridman was one of several anime this season that blew my expectations to smithereens. I'm not a huge mecha fan, so I was very skeptical at first, and didn't bother starting until halfway through the season. But damn was I impressed. It started out strong, and every episode kept getting better and better, up until the grand finale - one of the best final episodes I can remember. Here's some of the key points.\r\nPlot - How many plot twists can an anime have without losing its impact? You could tell that the writers were having a blast working on this, as the entire storyline feltloose and free; nothing was forced, everything came naturally, and minor plot holes were shrugged off only to be patched by the next reveal. Every time a major plot twist happened it felt like it for sure would be the last, so every new event always came as a surprise. \\n\\n\r\nArt - The style was pretty normal, with just a miniscule hint of shaft-y accents, and CGI for the kaiju that wasn't terrible and was appropriate for the circumstance. There was nothing to complain about, and I did like the subtle accentuation.\\n\\n\r\nSound - UNION is the hypest OP I've heard since OPM. The hook is so good, and the lyrics fit both the melody and the anime. Actually one of the best openings I can think of in terms of lyrical relevance. Others have also praised the voice acting, which I didn't really notice much but I think that was the point. I don't remember anything special about the actual soundtrack though.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - Really meh in this department.... which was disappointing because the story was so great. On the other hand, the story explains why there's not a whole lot of character development, and including more background would go against the plot. Knowing the reason, however, doesn't change the fact that the characters are weak. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - This very quickly became one of my favorites this season, and one that I was eagerly waiting for each week. That puts it in 8/10 territory, for me.",

The animation is okay. \r\nEvery single one of them were uninteresting, the only thing I can remember was their pretty designs, there was little exceptional about them, their chemistry non-existent and \"FRIENDSHIP\" was painful to sit through even though in the end they [potential spoiler] actually defeated the main shadow villain with the power of their friendship, yes, really.[potential spoiler ends]. \r\nEven the villain, who's motivations is flimsy and inexplicable because it is coupled with the confusing plot, one really hasno idea what the villain is. Human, God, Dreaming? What? It doesn't matter but I thought there was some other huge twist coming at the end but turns out that was all and I was like suppose to know the settings on my own already. The only thing that carried the series forward is the character design and the anticipation of a twist that never came. And that was the other reason I watched it for. \\n\\n\r\nIt is really excruciating as there was a clear buildup for a twist but the multiple twists are so absolutely nonsensical because the settings itself is unexplained and it really has no effect on the overall story. \\n\\n\r\nThere is also this theme about Grid and computers, and Hyper World, blah, blah, blah, but it is again, unexplained. I would assume probably because this was based on an old TV series from the 90s, this is like a spiritual sequel and you are just supposed to know what it's about? I don't see why they can't explain the settings either for new watchers because that was the only thing I can wonder about as the plot trots forward confusingly. \\n\\n\r\nIt's a confusing mess. I thought it was going to get better because of how little they explained at the start and how there were so many random things going on in the city, I thought there were going to be hints littered around about the settings here and there, but no, there was fucking nothing. The settings remained unexplained, and the twist was something that happened within the settings. \\n\\n\r\nIt's mediocre. I want to call it bad but the design, music, art, and animation elevates this a lot. So, I suppose it is just mediocre.",

            "content": "Two month or so ago back when the first episode of SSSS. Gridman came out, it was met with a mixed reaction and many people didn't continue the show. This is due to a huge chunk of present fanbase only tries to find context on surface material. In fact, a huge part of anime fans thinks any show with giant mechs fighting have no other theme or story other than cheap monster-a-week fights. \r\nEverything that happens in the show is part of a meta-narrative. As the story progresses the narration slowly expands and by the end you'll view every incident of the story in adifferent angle. Although you'll probably be able to guess what the meta-narration is for by Episode 10,it still doesn't make the ending any less emotionally powerful.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of the show is a perfectly balanced mixture of Goofy Side Characters and Emotionally driven protagonists. Something Hiroyuki Imaishi does in a lot of his works. It's hard to get into the characters without giving away spoilers so,I'll just point out my favorite two characters and their brilliant dynamic. Akane and Rikka are my two most favorite characters and their relationship has the best development in the entire show. Rikka had thousands of reason to turn her back on Akane but she didn't. She reached out to Akane and was genuinely able to get through.The most amazing thing is this brilliant character arc never played second fiddle to the show's actions.\\n\\n\r\nNeon Genesis Evangelion's influence in the show is very evident.It's a mecha driven narrative with underlying themes of loneliness, isolation and escapism.In fact,the SSSS Gridman team is called Neon Genesis Junior High Students. This is the beauty of the show to be honest. This show is made by people whose passion for the shows that inspired them sips through each and every frame of the show.",

To fully experience this masterpiece you at least have to watch some of the old Ultra series as this anime is a tribute to those incredible works in the past.\r\nStory 10\r\nI found myself very intrigued by the mysterious world of SSSS and this is the part that i love about Trigger. They reveal just little bit about the world each episodes to keep the audience engaged and they're really good at doing this. Every tiny details, every bits are all connected helping to build up the story then when the the twist hit, it feelsreally satisfying and not just for the sake of shock value. In addition, the pacing is excellent and i could see the time and effort they spent to make all the plots comes together. \\n\r\nThe fights between Kaiju and Gridman are exhilarating as hell and every fights has its own depth and meaning, oR its just really cool to have Gridman overpowering them all with cool combinations of transformations.\\n\r\nArt 10 \\n\r\nTrigger went all out on this masterpiece. The screenplay, the colorful world, the aesthetics, those damn sakuga, Im mean ComE ON Kaijus vs Giant Robots anime style. There were some uses of CG and its not half bad, also i think it fits perfectly. The amount of details of the world, the characters, the Kaiju and the Gridmans (different versions of him) makes for an \"above average\" of your typical highschool anime. The Kaijus each has unique styles, strengths, and abilities adapted to defeat Gridman. Trigger really is the king of Mechas.\\n\r\nSound 10\\n\r\nRight from the get go, you can hear only the sounds, no music, just sounds and it gives me chills every times. I noticed that there were little uses of soundtrack (but it's fine cause those tracks are awsome) and just the sounds and it makes me very emerged in the world of SSSS, the humming of the mites, the noises during break times at school , the chorus in the background ... AnD that song they use in the final fight, uwe! the nostalgia\\n\r\nA little bit about the ending, perfect for the relationships between Rikka and Akane, outstanding\\n\r\nCharacter 9\\n\r\nI wont be able to talk about our characters too much without spoiling the entire anime but again Trigger has outdone themselves making me invested in these people. And the one who surprised me the most was Anti, thats all I have to say\\n\r\nAlso, Rikka thicc thighs\\n\r\nAlso Also, Akane panty hose\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10\\n\r\nI watched a lot of the Ultra series as a kid and SSSS G man is a like an anime style payoff to the late 90s series on how great they were back then. I was just excited as much as I was a kid watching this anime giving me chills whether I recall the feelings of similar moments being recreated with such love, care and creativity\\n\r\nOverall, I love SSSS. Gridman, and Trigger for their talented and dedicated staff. I just love them\\n\\n",

That was a joke and I haven't seen the original Gridman. But, hey, no one does.\r\nIn my monthly reading of Tokupedia forums to find a good Toku to watch since Zi-O and Lupin vs Pato are a big disappointment. I found this, this thing is called another disappointment.\r\nAs a Tokusatsu, the writing is bound to be cheesy. But here's the thing about Gridman, it wasn't cheesy enough. Whatis the right amount of cheese? If the Toei Spider-Man is the cheesiest, the Power Rangers Movie (the old one) is the right amount.  The Godzilla VS movies are beyond the right amount, because you can see Godzilla \"THE Symbol for Atom Bombs\" dicking around and fight other monsters in various comedic ways.\\n\\n\r\nAfter blurting out some Toku references, I forgot that I'm supposed talking about the story. The structure of each episode is repetitive just like every live-action tokusatsu, but in the live action, the monster moves like a baby that can only jump and flail their arms around like an idiot and whenever the mecha are combined it's stood there, gloriously and that makes watching Tokusatsu as a grown man an awesome experience.\\n\r\nThis thing's monster and mecha are fully CG, not the entire show just the most important part of any tokusatsu series.\\n\\n\r\nI see this video in my YouTube recommendations talking about how the janky low framerate movement is realistic and it encapsulates the movement of the bodysuit, that video was made by the same person who never watch any tokusatsu when he was an adult and thinks the Detective Pikachu trailer is good.\\n\r\nIf a tokusatsu is done in traditional animation, the designs could be more expressive and the movements more fluid. Instead, they use cheap 3DCG with stiff motion. This is even worse than Shin Godzilla.\\n\r\nWhat we can take from all this? Ultraman (2019) is safe to skip.\\n\\n\r\nSo let's move to the characters, there's amnesia boy, basic osananananajimi, thigh girl, god girl, and an alien wearing Kamina shades. Whenever I see a TRIGGER character using those shades, I got reminded the fact that Kamina died a virgin.\\n\r\nThe God girl is TRIGGER's attempt to make another religion, the only thing that stands in their way is that Akaneism doesn't roll off the tongue very well.\\n\r\nThe character design is the best thing about the show, I found 31 artists to follow just by looking at Danbooru, I only found 14 with Yuru Camp. \\n\r\nThe subtle naming of the mecha power up cast's school is the most stealthy reference of the decade and the voice for Rikka's mom is just Haruko.\\n\\n\r\nDespite all this, The dream sequence at episode 9 is exciting, the Cleaner Kaiju are really cool, the food design was weird enough i tried and failed making it, the last fight finally use 2D, the last shot makes me giggle like a little kid and this makes hopeful for another TRIGGER anime.",

            "content": "Much like Planet With of last season, SSSS.Gridman is an emotionally driven show with big ol robots flying around in O.K. CG. And just like Planet With, Gridman is criminally underrated. I've never written a review here before, but I just wanted to give my 2 cents about how I felt. I'm not knowledgeable on the Tokusastu genre so I wasn't able to appreciate all the references packed into the series, but I still enjoyed the hell out of this show. If you are someone who appreciates art direction I highly recommend you watch this. There were so many interesting and well chosen shots thatkeep you invested and unable to look away. The first episode does a great job setting the tone and is full of fantastic still images. I remember looking at an image of a staircase closed for repairs thinking \"why are these stairs mood\". The direction in this show put a fat grin on my face the entire way through, episode 9 especially.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the kaiju v Gridman battles are in semi-clunky CG models that somehow still feel awesome. They feel just like a Tokusatsu battle with humans fighting in giant monster costumes. I personally loved the CG fights but I can see how it could be off-putting to some. \\n\\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, this show is definitely not all style with no substance, not making the amnesia trope feel annoying is testament enough to the writing. There were many tense moments where characters from opposite sides had to interact with each other, rather than groups fighting by proxy through kaiju vs. Gridman battles, and each moment was perfectly satisfying. But like I said I don't write reviews and don't care enough to put out my librarian glasses and spend 30 minutes writing a literary analysis.\\n\\n\r\nSSSS.Gridman's mix of style, direction, and story make it an INCREDIBLY entertaining watch and I highly recommend it to anyone who appreciates good art in their anime.",

I'll try to make this review as spoiler-free as possible.\r\nFrom the show's relatively humble beginnings to it's grandiose end, it's was excellent all the way through.\r\nSSSS.Gridman is an amusing blend of genres, putting one of the spotlights on the school life aspect of it's main cast but driving itself forward through both elements of Mecha and Kaijuu tokusatsu shows. It's the perfect transition to animation an original Henshin tokusatsu show could ever ask for.\r\nEvery episode littered with great cinematography, art and animation accompanied with high energy tracks that compliment the production.\r\nIt's filled to the brim with 2D sakuga andfluid CG animation which shows just how passionate the staff was about the whole show.\\n\r\nThe atmosphere's carefully crafted by the proper use of soundracks and effects combined with the cinematography consisting of airless, sort of confined shots of the blistering summer heat and oppressive cloudy rains. It gives the show a sense of an identity that a lot of recent anime just can't seem to grasp.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is rather formulaic as it sticks to a Monster of The Week format but the archetypical structure of the format is broken down in a few places, making way for an actual overarching plot within the setup.\\n\r\nEvery plot point the show setup was unveiled at a proper pacing, and while the characters lacked development outside of Akane, the underlying themes still got through and eventually culminated into it's fantastic ending which saw Akane finally facing herself instead of finding fault in everything else.\\n\\n\r\nThe entire roster is colorful and visually distinct, making them easy to remember, and potentially iconic - someday, down the line.\\n\r\nThe development for Hibiki, Rikka and Utsumi did feel kind of miniscule in the grand scheme of things and they should've gotten more screen time addressing their personal characteristics but the main focus of the plot didn't really require much on that front so they can be given a pass.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it's a great show that's totally worth everyone's time and attention.",

I will be as honest and clear as possible.\r\nI'm finding extremely hard to decide if I'm enjoying this show or not.\r\nIt has some really strong points: it's beautifully crafted, pleasing to the senses. Even the apparent junkiness of the 3D animation has its charme. The main theme is catchy enough, and the OST does a good job overall, even though it doesn't really shine.\r\nGridman isn't just well presented, it's a homage to the tokusatsu genre, and it does it well. The tropes are there, from the repeated transformation scenesto the episodic cadence of new enemies to defeat.\\n\r\nThe issues are the characters and, most importantly, the story.\\n\r\nSome characters have their moments, but they're mostly generic, and the only things keeping them from being completely flat are a few recurring gags. There is very little in terms of development and they don't feel human at all. They try from time to time, but any attempt at sentimentalism ends up feeling underdeveloped at best, affected at worst.\\n\r\n\"Underdeveloped\" may very well be the keyword when it comes to describing the show's shortcomings.\\n\r\nThe story hints from the very beginning at some hidden mistery, it makes you feel like something is wrong and needs an explanation, it makes you want an explanation, but when the revelations come they feel arbitrary, abstract, disjointed. It's a story where anything can happen without a proper reason, and we're asked to simply accept whatever it tells us. Some themes are potentially interesting, but they're never properly developed in a cohesive and logical storytelling. This has left me with a feeling of estrangement, and I couldn't really connect with the shallow characters or the incongruous storytelling, despite its potential.\\n\r\nSSSS.Gridman can still be an enjoyable show, if seen as a love letter to the kaiju genre.

The plot and characters, if giant robots and transformers were excluded, would have shone more. I'm not implying I don't like mecha anime, if I did I wouldn't have even started watching Gridman. I just feel like the robot fights are so out of the blue, and it could be replaced with another kind of plot, like a mind/time-controlling power held by Shinjo. \r\nAlso Yuta, being the main character, is even simpler than some secondary characters. How so? \r\nOneaspect I really liked about this show is its animation. You'll say: what? It's not even that good. Indeed! But it creates some kind of soft and warm atmosphere around the city and the places where the story develops. I love the scenery, even if the quality isn't the best.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum up, what I'm enjoying (and think I'll enjoy) the most, are the parts of the episodes where relationships between characters (which are pretty bland anyway) are formed, and I rather skip the robot fights.",

            "content": "SSSS Gridman is an interesting anime to review because it is really two different animes in one. One is good, one is... meh.\r\nThe first part of SSSS. Gridman is the typical mystery, romance, and slice of life. I find this to be great. The main character has amnesia and is a little goofy at first, but he will grow on you pretty quickly as a decent MC. His best friend is a typical best friend in these types of shows, forgettable, but at least he is not annoying. \r\nThe strength of this show is the female cast, particularly the main female girl, Rikka (the loveinterest) and the \"enemy,\" Akane. Rikka is probably the best girl of the season, very strong female character who does her own thing and not your typical love interest girl who just goes along with whatever the MC wants/likes. Akane could make a run for best girl, though her being the bad guy is putting her at a disadvantage (not really a spoiler because it is stated so early on in the anime).\\n\\n\r\nThe mystery is how and why things happening the way they are instead of who is doing what. So far, the mystery is entertaining enough.\\n\\n\r\nThe downside to this anime is the action sequences which will remind viewers of the corny old school Power Ranger fights... at the end of each episode where the enemies grow exponentially and the good guys bring out some huge mechanized human looking thing. These fights are corny as hell and majority of the adults who watch this anime will cringe at these sequences. The good part is that they are a very small part of each episode and they do not overstay their welcome.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoy watching this episode mostly for the interactions between each character and to figure out what is going on. If you can get by a 3-5 minute corny Power Rangers-esque fight each episode, I think you will find enjoyment out of this anime.",

Considering this is coming from someone who grew up watching Power Rangers as a kid, I would have fallen in love with the genre to begin with.\r\nSSSS. Gridman is actually a reboot of the original of Gridman since the people behind the Gridman series, Tsuburaya Productions collaborated with Kill La Kill and Darling of the Franxx studio Trigger.\r\nStory - The shows prime focus is on Yuta and his friends Rikka and Utsumi. Yuta and his friends discovered a run down computer thathas Gridman inside. Ultimately, Yuta and Gridman, alongside with the help of the Neon Genesis Junior High Students, decided to team up to stop giant monsters, also known as \"Kaijus\" from destroying the city. The person making the kaijus is Akane, who is also a classmate for the Gridman Alliance in school. She is also being manipulated by Alexis Kerib to create these monsters.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a very bare bones plot at first, but it does change things around at the last few episodes. Despite the fact that Yuta is Gridman himself, the anime doesn't focus a whole lot on him in terms of plot. He has important roles in the story, but the show focuses more on the other characters. More specifically Rikka and Akane and their relationship with each other. The ending was a great way to end off the series in my opinion.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - The characters did take some time getting used to. Some of them I like but other ones didn't leave a huge impact on me. That's not to say they're bad by any means. They are developed as the show goes on and they do liven up the plot. Akane is honestly my favorite character simply because she stands out from the crowd by just being this evil mastermind who loves to live in her own fantasy world. To a certain degree, I also sort of relate to her. I too want to live in my own fantasy world where I can have as many friends as I want and do whatever I want to do (though I'm not going to send monsters out to destroy things. I'm not that evil.) I loved the chemistry between Rikka and Akane as well. Rikka knows that even with all of the terrible things Akane has done, she still refers to Akane as her friend. It's a touching moment that'll leave an impact on you.\\n\\n\r\nEveryone else though I can't really say a lot about. I think my least favorite character has to be Yuta. I did like him at first but as the show goes on, he really doesn't contribute too much to the series besides becoming Gridman and having amnesia. I did like his chemistry with his friends though, much like with Rikka did to Akane. And he does have his moments with Akane as well, but besides that nothing too noteworthy.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound - Since this is Trigger making it, you know what you're in for. The animation looks really damn good. The 3D fight scenes look fun and frantic and the 2D animation is bright and colorful too. I'm a huge sucker for those kind of animes and I will gush about them non stop if I could. And the music is also damn catchy. I do like the OP and the shows soundtrack. They utilize background music perfectly, fitting with the tone of the series. If they released the soundtrack, I would buy it in a heartbeat.\\n\\n\\n\r\nVerdict - I liked this anime. True it has faults but it more than makes it up for it by having a good plot, great animation, and a faithful source to the original Gridman series. If you loved the original Gridman, then you'll have a blast with this one. And even coming from an outsiders point of view, I still enjoyed it.\\n\\n\r\nScore - 7/10",

            "content": "I never watched a minute of toku as a child, teen, or adult. Since SSSS.Gridman is a heart-covered love letter to that genre, I could take that as a sign that I should recuse myself from providing an opinion. But since my overall impression is positive, I'm going to go ahead and add mine to the pile.\r\nSSSS.Gridman is a lightly metafictional take on the tokusatsu genre, injecting the classic action formula with MFA-ish storytelling priorities (e.g. depression, the nature of living in a narrative, etc). That's not a knock against it: crossing the streams takes us somewhere relatively unique. I'd call it a more straight-lacedSamurai Flamenco, and that's good company.\\n\\n\r\nThe focus is split between Yuuta, an amnesiac with a heart of gold (trust me, don't run away, it's set-up for a nice hat trick later on) and Shinjo Akane, a girl with both a Columbine High mentality and the ability to create Kaiju. Yuuta can turn into Gridman, who is somewhere on the all-caps JUSTICE scale between 1960's Superman and contemporary Captain America. You might guess that Akane is more interesting. You're right. But Yuuta's antics do have a classic appeal, and Trigger does their usual good job of leaning on the mechanics/standards of a genre for effect.\\n\\n\r\nThe style of the fights takes a moment to get used to, but works marvelously. Trigger did an excellent job of giving the movements of the kaiju and Gridman variants a sense of scale and gravity. They lumber the way something of that size should. Thanks to the animation, and show underlining these battles having very real casualties, every building that gets knocked over feels like it matters.\\n\\n\r\nI have an odd relationship with the ending. I'm fine with the outline of events, wherein Akane finds some measure of autonomy and acceptance. The last fight looks great, and they do a decent job of not leaving any threads dangling. Then there's the big \"but.\" I think there's a tendency in spec-fic to associate going abstract with a good climax. And it can be done well. But in Gridman's last episode, I don't quite feel the sense of control that it takes to make that narrative work.\\n\\n\r\nI think it comes down to the pacing of the last episode. Most of this show works because of how deftly it handles it's atmosphere, and the doling out of information. That's a sharp contrast Alexis and Gridman shouting at each other about mortality, which feels a little familiar. Granted, you're supposed to see a few echoes of the past in a tribute like S.S.S.S.Gridman. But it's possible to get a little too much of a good thing.\\n\\n\r\nSamurai Flamenco had similar inspiration, and handled the home stretch a little more artfully. As someone that enjoyed both, I recommend it as a companion piece for anyone that vibes with the overall tone of SSSS.Gridman.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a good time. Not perfect, but good. A fine choice for anyone looking for some extra optimism in their media diet.\\n",

            "content": "Essentially, SSSS.Gridman is a \"monster of the week\" format mecha anime, with a bit of a curve ball for the overall plot. This is something that I would only recommend to fans of mecha, trigger, or CG, and probably won't be something that I would consider re-watching. I had to give this show a 6 for a few reasons, but I would have given it a 6.5 if there was the option.\r\nThe opening theme by Oxt is a complete ear worm with a filthy bass line. The soundtrack wasn't too shabby either.\r\nThe CG was goofy in my opinion, but if CG decreases a project's productioncosts enough for it to get made, then its not such a terrible compromise. Good animation, especially the backgrounds, apart from the CG.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime was a bit over the top, and was very reminiscent of Tenga Toppa Gurren Laggan for that reason. (They even referenced/copied the drill break and Kamina's sunglasses.) I wish they didn't call out attack names constantly, but it wouldn't have been the same without that.\\n\\n\r\nThe Kaiju/gridman's design felt a little underwhelming, especially considering the series is an original and not trying to remain faithful to the source material or anything. Gridman's style definitely borrowed a little too heavily from Gundam. \\n\\n\r\nThe show's concept was interesting and pretty original, as far as I know, and sacrificed being well explained for the sake of not over-explaining things to death.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting/casting and character design were well done. I can usually find at least one character that irritates me to no end in every anime, but the characters in Gridman were mostly reasonable. \\n\\n\r\nThe pacing was consistent, and with only 12 episodes, this is a quick watch.\\n\\n",

Within the dream, Gridman is a personification of her desire to move forward. The Kaijus are reasons to not move forward fueled by depression. Another character in the dream, Anti, could be interpreted as many things but the easiest is anti-depressants/meds. The character Yuta, who sits near the popular kid but is ignored has a crush on someone that drives them and has a friend with the same interests, is Akane in the dream experiencing spectator-style Lucid Dream. When Yuta wakes up which was the end of sleeping Akane's lucid dream after she comes clean and possibly self-cured her depression.\\n\\n\r\nyeaaa over analysis! great stuff tho yea!\\n\\n\\n\\n",

This plot point completely undermines anything that was even remotely interesting about these characters' relationships andAkane herself. Oh, and later on it is also revealed that Yuuta, who was supposed to suffer from amnesia, is actually not Yuuta but Gridman, who is in no way related to Yuuta's friends, Rikka and Shou. \\n\\n\r\nWay to go Trigger!

            "content": "This review contains spoilers.\r\nThe first question to be asked is why do SSSS.Gridman decides to limit itself to a completely clich\u00e9d formula. It really grinds my gears to see a storyline with potential that decides to not invest in what makes it special. Instead, it invests exactly in what every other show already did much better than SSSS.Gridman ever could. \r\nThis show has a personality crisis. SSSS.Gridman has no idea what it wants to be. Is it a mecha show or a college slice of life with a twist? Because it surely can\u2019t be both. Here\u2019s the formula: The first 10 minutes of every episodewas college slice of life, and then the last 10 minutes were straight mecha action. I\u2019m certain that if it tried to pick only one of the two genres, it would be a much smoother experience. Heck, the premise of Akane constructing its own world was a really cool idea that just didn\u2019t deliver.\\n\\n\r\nSSSS.Gridman shows just how pointless a story can be. There is a massive screentime problem -  It starts and ends too slow for a show with only 12 episodes to spare. The first 6 episodes are all criminally short of explanations and the mecha fights are dragged around like we\u2019re in Dragonball. Let\u2019s not forget the production also added a pool episode just for the sake of pointless filler. This lack of proper screentime management led the show to have MANY plot-holes. SSSS.Gridman creates a universe, but can\u2019t explain it in time. It creates characters but have no time to give them backstories. Even Gridman, the center of the series, gets completely shadowed by the lack of proper direction. \\n\\n\r\nHibiki Yuuta is a bland and unappealing main character with no real objective. He is given a clich\u00e9 personality with an even more clich\u00e9 amnesia introduction. He has no backstory, never recovers from his amnesia, and has only ONE role in the entire show \u2013 to transform into not himself to fight some evil giant creatures. The story might have been better off without him taking unneeded screentime for himself.\\n\\n\r\nUtsumi and Rikka are simply useless characters that add nothing to the show. They are not involved with Gridman whatsoever, they get absolutely no backstory and no character development at all. Even when the show massively hints at Rikka and Utsumi being important for the storyline, all they get is a few lines of \u2018motivational\u2019 dialogue that can\u2019t possibly have changed anything.\\n\\n\r\nAkane is the only solid character as she is given a unique personality and is quite a decent antagonist. She has proper motivations for her actions and is an understandable character from the viewers point (who, being a omnipotent god, wouldn\u2019t make some unwanted people disappear from Earth?). Even though there really isn\u2019t much of her backstory revealed (of when she got to meet Alexis, how did she become a god in the first place, and even the horror that is the last scene shown in the last episode), at least we got what we got and that was okay. \\n\\n\r\nNazo gets a lot of screentime and some development but without proper background it doesn\u2019t really stand out. The rest of the characters aren\u2019t given any proper screentime to judge or are simply usable plot devices to make the story go forward.\\n\\n\r\nWhen the story has many flaws and the characters can\u2019t stand up for themselves, the conclusion just can\u2019t work. The climax is never there because there was no build-up in the first place. The storyline starts, and then ends, and you are left hanging like \u201cwas that it?\u201d. Why did Akane create the world? Why was she always with Alexis? Who are the supporting characters that transform into Gridman parts? Why does Gridman fight? WHO IS GRIDMAN? SSSS.Gridman makes a very strong case that it does NOT want to address these questions. And it is all a damn shame.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s an okay show animation-wise. I am not a fan of the 2D-CGI mix, even more when the last fight scene suddenly wants to go 2D, but the CGI was bearable. There are A LOT of recycled scenes that really kind of bothered me, and it bugs me that the episode with the best animation was the pool episode.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack was nothing special.\\n",

Then something clicked with me as the Gridman started showing what it was about. There was always a looming oppressive feel over everything mostly due to the fact that there was next to no background music. Anything background noise related was always based on the scene creating this intense feeling that a kaiju was gonna pop up out of nowhere. The dialogue never drug its feet and every conversation had real weight and meaning never truly bogged down by exposition ormeaningless dialogue. Everything about this show just fell into place and really struck some sort of chord with me. \\n\\n\r\nCombine all of these story telling elements really fun and flashy and overall just hype battle scenes makes for a really fun watch for anyone who grew up with these shows/movies with great characters and an oddly sinister feeling to its world and that makes Gridman what it is. Sidenote, I have never seen a show end with a 15 second epilogue that completely changes the entire narrative of the show into something completely different. Shattering any preconceived notion for what the \"universe\" of the show was and adding insane levels of depth to an already technically deep show.",

            "content": "I didn't finish this series until after it aired, but overall this is another solid show by Trigger. In fact I give it an 8 out of 10 overall since it's not perfect, and in fact has some flaws or issues. That said, just form an entertainment standpoint, and if you're a kaiju or mecha fan, you'll enjoy this show a lot. \r\nFor starters, and I do my best to not spoil too much about the story. It's a good story, but not great. The one spoiler I have to say to explain some things is revealed in the mid episodes about how world isn'treal, and is fact a creation of one main character. Now for this story it works well; however, it also leave some questions unanswered. Such as how this one person were able to create it, how this person got to this point, and so forth. Now these questions don't deter from the plot, but the lore creation is a little shaky here. Furthermore, there are other characters who developed in a way I may not fully agree with the direction. I won't go into too many details, but I will say how the hero ends up isn't bad at all, and is a good ending. Furthermore, the story in the 2nd half has more psychological elements, and it was presented well. Therefore, the ending fits the world I mention how it was created by one person and not our actual world. \\n\\n\r\nThat said, beyond some of the basis of the world, the main story of the main characters, their issues, and how they interact is well done. I truly enjoy Trigger's character creation from their aesthetics to their personalities overall. The characters goal is to fight off the Kaiju that keep invading their city, and somehow resets the world after every battle. That is the premise of the first half of the story until things are revealed, then it shifts to handling the world's creator. The overarching premise is fighting the Kaiju that invade the world, and figure out why and where they come from. Everything comes full circle in the end, and it works. \\n\\n\r\nMoving beyond the story which is the most complex aspect of this show, the animation is amazing. I mention the character designs earlier, and I stand by how they have a great designs. The same thing goes for the Kaiju designs overall which are basically cool and fun. As a Godzilla fan I enjoyed this show a lot, and the battles were beautifully well done. Minus a few scenes here and there where the CGI stood out a little bit, but the animation was pretty flawless. Even the non-action scenes such as everyday life were beautifully presented. \\n\\n\r\nMeanwhile the sound design was amazing as well. Since this is a giant monster fighting show, I expected top notch sound design, and we got it. The roars of the kaiju was good, and the action sounds from attacks to direct hits was amazing. It almost had an Evangelion feel at times during the battles, and Gridman's theme was awesome. \\n\\n\r\nOverall it's a very good show. From an entertainment value alone you wouldn't have feel to waste your time. That said, my only issue is the story to an extent. The story works, and isn't bad at all. In fact, it's a good story. My issue is some questions surrounding the world leaves me wondering how the world came to be, how a certain character enter it, and so forth. That said, it's worth a watch.",

Gridman is an anime reboot of a live action, tokusatsu (aka ultraman, power rangers etc) show from the 90s. Keep this in mind, take the goofiness of a kids TV program, stylized it as a Trigger anime then add a dash of seinen serious tone. This combination; the contrast between the absurdity of giant heroes fighting kaijus and high-schoolers dealing with loss and death, turns out to be a beautiful amalgamation of visual and auditory spectacular. \r\nStory:\r\nEvery episode follows the basic Tokusatsu structure; discovery, contact, conflict and resolution.The Gridman alliance will go about their daily lives after resolution from the previous episode and discover a new threat. This comes in both the kaiju, their true enemies or even drama that they fear would affect the group's dynamics. Next is Contact, where the group or members of the group confront's said discovery (Hibiki's indirect manner of interacting with Rikka after she attended a mixer, the alliance's approach after knowing Akane's secret). Following that is Conflict, this is where you have Gridman fighting the Kaiju(s) and how the alliance have to adapt their approach due to the limitations of their memories. Finally resolution, Gridman fights the kaiju, struggles, then gets a power up from the alliance and beats the kaiju.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nBeautiful, just fucking beautiful. Theres a lot of subtle nuance to the background and how they invoke this mundane atmosphere which is quickly demolished by the appearance of Kaijus. Gridman and the Kaijus are mostly CG but not the shitty quality kind that you see in the background characters of Hataraku Saibou or even Bunny-senpai. Theres a polish and this glossly tone to them contrasting them to the bland and flat colors of the world, indicating their abnormality in this world. There are several shots of our characters doing nothing but laying around, drinking tea, listening to music etc. All mundane tasks that we do in our real lives, theres not attempt to make these activities more lively or colorful because you cant and you shouldnt. Real life is boring, that is why we have fantasy, its escapism. Going back to the background designs, theres a later part of the show where you are shown this other world that is different from the world our character is based on. During those scenes, the lines between CG and drawn animation are blurred to the point of indistinguishable. My final point for the art of the show; DRAWN EXPLOSION. If you've watched Shirobako, you might remember this scene where 2 directors argue over whether to use CG or drawn explosion, the latter being more time consuming and costly. Every fight scene ends with this bombastic combustion from the defeated Kaijus (like the always do whenever the power rangers or ultraman defeats a monster) and its just so beautiful. The animation for these explosions are fluid and smooth and splashes on bright colors into this bleak and dull environment. If drawn explosions are truly more time-consuming as shirobako has pointed out, it has definitely paid off in terms of the emotions that is being brought out in those scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nSoundtrack is beautiful, both OP and ED are made to get you hyped up for the next fight, especially the OP which brings forth the mixture of melancholy and excitement and accurately representing the dark and fun aspects of the show (dealing with/preventing loss and Gridman fighting Kaijus). Every fight will end off with the chorus of the OP being played, giving you that hope that Gridman is gonna prevail (like how they do in power rangers and ultraman). The sound effects used are beautiful, from the sounds of cicada in the summer, music leaking out of Rikka's earphones and other monotonous sounds of the real world to sound Gridman makes when he transforms or gets a power boost. These effects, while minor, adds up to the tone of the scene and hype for each fight. \\n\r\nLastly, the silence. There is little to no qwerky tune or songs played during our character's conversations. You only hear the conversations between our characters or whatever elements that was present in those scenes. This again hammers in the point that REAL LIFE IS BORING and reminiscent to my viewing of the first Digimon movie where everything outside the digital world was slow and dull. The lack of qwerky and fun music makes certain scene really serious and uncomfortable, ie Akane and Rikka on the bus, Akane's conversation with Hibiki at the River, making you pay close attention to the subtle nuance characters are doing/saying/implying.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nWithout revealing too much about the show, the character dynamics for the most part is good. The strongest (and has the most layers) would definitely be Akane, Anti and the crew of Neon Genesis Junior High (NGJH). The rest with the exception of Rikka are pretty one dimensional but thats not necessarily a bad thing. Hibiki has amnesia and only has to rely on the alliance and Gridman. Utsumi is Hibiki's best friend and a Kaiju weeb and gets fired up during every fight, sometimes to his detriment. \\n\r\nOur main antagonist Alexis, is your typical straight up evil being who exist only to destroy. He manipulates others and has no real motivation to see kaijus destroying the city other than \"he likes it\". That sounds really bad right? However, we get these scenes where Alexis interacts with the other members, engaging in candid dialogues and almost having a meal with Hibiki. Its almost as if destruction is just a hobby to this character, take that a way, he can simply become a normal person who jokes around his friends that no one would notice (apart from looking like a villain, but the restaurant owner seem to mind). \\n\r\nThe NGJH are the accessories and weapons of Gridman in human form. Each having their own distinct personality and preferences but are united under the Gridman cause, they serve mainly as the supporting cast but in the latter episodes, shown that they have a care for others and the Gridman Alliance crew (ie. Max cleaning the dishes behind the cafe counter). \\n\r\nAnti is the underdog of the show and whose story is one of redemption and acceptance, basically Viral of Gurren Lagann, and theres no way i can hate such a character.\\n\r\nLastly everyone's waifu, Akane (whom i want to kick me in the face). Akane and the Alliance have this L and Kira dynamics going on for half the show. Both parties have information that the other does not and want to see the other fail. Its a game of cat and mouse to see who's gonna get who first. Theres no way i can elaborate further without spoilers so if you like the character design (or have a foot fetish), just watch the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI've seen a couple of bad reviews on this show and could only attribute them to the lack of understanding of the source material. This is an adaptation of basically ultraman. Theres gonna be cheesy moments because thats the very nature of the show. It is a show that requires you to play attention to for the subtle hints to certain phenomenon. Character motivations ranges from simplistic to downright complex, each with their own merits and watching that kind of character drama being resolved (like how they do in a good seinen show) is extremely satisfying. If i were to pick a flaw of the show, it'd be the lack of screen time for NGJH since they're easily the most badass characters.",

            "content": "What to say about this show?\r\nThe plot is pretty good, if straightforward - Our amnesiac protagonist Yuuta Hibiki fights a monster of the week. The whole story is one huge homage to the tokusatsu and anime of the '70 and '80s From Ultraman to Gamera to the early Giant robot anime. It even used the over-saturated colors of the glossy anime magazines. Except the world makes no sense, and Yuuta is the only one who realizes it, until he clues in his friends. The story quickly moves from simple fights against Kaiju into the mystery of their reality.\r\nBut that's not what this anime is abouteither. It's a meta story, about the experience of watching anime. It deals with why we love all these characters, the good and the bad, and what effect they had on us when we were kids. About how they expressed our emotions when we couldn't, and how they let us dream of a brighter future, where we would have the power to could defeat anything that was getting us down.",

            "content": "This is a surprisingly good series that starts simple but quickly becomes rich with character complexity and development. People who are not able to appreciate the creativity and care that went into the series are smoking something.\r\nGridman is not a simple monster of the week beat-em-up as it might appear based on the first few episodes. On first watching the first three episodes feel almost formulaic, but soon it becomes clear that there is far more to the story.\r\nAside from the character development, the standout aspect of this show is the cinematography and how it is used to effect visual storytelling. Nearly every shot isdripping with implication and meaning; characterization also benefits from this as the way characters are posed and frames speaks volumes without requiring a word of dialogue. It's clear that the creators of this show are masters of the craft and had a clear vision for what they wanted to create.\\n\\n\r\nI have two recommendations. One, don't stop watching until at least the 4th episode as the series takes about this long to really get going.\\n\\n\r\nTwo, watch it a second time. There are many small but significant details hidden in plain sight that will make more sense and be appreciated more on a second viewing.",

What I mean by this is that you can't necessarily understand whats going on around you, but you still want to know what the hell is going on and why things are the way they are. \r\nIf you're a mecha fan,then I'd say give it a try, as it's an interesting combination.

Although the action is the worst part of the show, the dialogue and story feels lackluster and mediocre. There's course-correction later on with a Haruhi-esque twist, but with a completely forgettable main cast it just runs completely out of steam and falls more or less on its face.\r\nThe art direction for everything but thebattle scenes is superb.

The art style is very good from how it stays to be relatively polished throughout with the sound doing a great effort to having depth. As for the soundtrack the songs sound very good but they rarely show up to fit in with the subtle tone of the story. The favorite song in the soundtrack is the opening and the cyber sounding theme that happens sometimes in the action moments in Gridman to show howpowerful he is or the mysterious world. \\n\\n\r\nFor the story so far I am amazed from the amount of suspicion the show places on the characters and how the world works. What makes me very thrilled for the things that happen in SSSS.Gridman is that I always anticipate when stuff that is similar to the plot-points in the original tokusatsu show or any type of reference to the things inside that show. People who have seen the original tokusatsu or even Ultraman will be grasping into the style of SSSS.Gridman while for people outside that medium may have to dedicate some energy to watching it. \\n\\n\r\nIn its own right SSSS.Gridman is a good show that balances from having mystery or suspicion moments for those who want a somewhat brain running story. And for those people who can get into the kaiju battles with Gridman. The show can be slow especially if you are currently waiting for the next episodes in this point of time, however I am excited for the upcoming climax that will reveal potential awesome moments and closure to the characters. \\n",

However, if you're looking for something to watch brainlessly you're in the right place. You won't get more than a few good moments with the opening popping in- some likable characters and some RANK A WAIFUS. So go ahead. Watch it.\r\nStory is as weird and just generic as you can get-- But who the **ckeven cares man. If you're looking for a high quality show with deep threads between each and every character with awesome character development you're wrong here- and you probably know that already. It's solely to be somewhat entertaining which--if you plan on watching this brainlessly- it is. It got some nice top tier girls that I'm shocked I haven't seen a reddit post with them yet. Heck, the girls are most likely the only good point about this Anime- aside the somewhat cute protagonist #nohomo. Our main waifu is drawn and animated in such a good way that you can't help but fall for her.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Man, pretty good........... *with a little CGI* *cough*\\n\\n\r\nSound: Nothing substantial- honestly.

However, as I said earlier it got some top class A rank waifus to ship your anime oc with since I know that's how much of a **** trash head you are. It's fine though. I'm not here to judge you.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: For the braindead shonen trashhead I am- it p IGHT\\n\\n\r\nOverall: If you're at this point in the review-- Yes, go watch it.",

            "content": "Something about SSSS.Gridman just feels eerily incomplete. That's a given since the show hasn't finished airing, but it's an impression that comes across loud and clear, whether purposefully or not.  \r\nTo preface for anyone considering watching, SSSS.Gridman isn't a mecha anime like Code Geass, Gurren Lagann, or Trigger's recent Darling in the Franxx. Rather than the steady, continuous narrative that these series build up, SSSS.Gridman has a distinctly episodic feel in structure, like the original Gridman, or shows like Ultraman or Power Rangers. There's a consistency to each episode that you'll soon get used to, with various flavor of the day monsters/Kaiju appearing justlike the shows of old. But oddly enough, the show's main draw is the plot outside these confrontations, which moves unrelentingly forward with new discoveries, and unexpected developments, and that's what's causing this feeling of disconnect. \\n\\n\r\nWe know what usually happens. As great as watching throwback fights with weird monsters is, older shows like Ultraman are nothing if not consistent in execution. But SSSS.Gridman feels like it's hinting at more from the very start, that it's more than meets the eye if you just stay tuned and keep watching. Unlike any of the shows mentioned above, which are unabashedly themselves from the get go, SSSS.Gridman feels like there's always more. That there's some secret just around the corner that will show you SSSS.Gridman's true colors. Whether you think you'll like that is the deciding factor in whether you should give it a watch. \\n\\n\r\nOtherwise the show's art is sharp, but static. Characters and scenes feel well drawn and distinctive, but there's a noticeable lack of animation or movment in many scenes. You won't be getting that sweet, sweet sakuga if that's what you're after. The rest of the SSSS.Gridman also doesn't feel particularly good or bad, with a decent score, and fight scenes that you may have mixed feelings about. \\n\\n\r\nIf you're into mecha fusions, fights against CGI'd monsters in a big city backdrop then by all means, look no further. But the real focus of the show seems to be outside of its daily monster mash and more on setting up a string of mysteries, reveals, twists and turns. Will it payoff? We'll have to see.\\n",

Gridman almost adds nothing new to the genre, really. A boy wakes up with a severe case of amnesia, gets pulled into a series event that he doesn't even know of, with a righteous, justice-oriented partner. But the twist at the middle of the series genuinely surprised me, I'm looking forward for more of what the series has to offer.\r\nArt: 8/10\r\nThe character style of SSSS. Gridman makes it clear that it's a show from StudioTrigger, it has problems here and there especially at 5/6 above perspective, but I feel like it does the job well and so far I don't have a really major problems with it. However, the use of CG for the Kaiju fights is the one that really pulls me in. At first glance it looks mediocre at best, but after a while I've grown to like it to the point that I feel like I've fallen in love with it. Seeing that this show is a throwback to classic Tokusatsu series the use of CG really captures the \"Actor in a big suit\" feeling which makes the Tokusatsu series iconic in the first place, but sometimes the switch between the CG and hand-drawn (not actually) scenes can be a little jarring.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nNow, I'm not really a master when it comes to sound design, but I really, really like the sound design of SSSS. Gridman. The sound effects of Gridman's fist clashing with a Kaiju, I really enjoy all of them.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\r\nWhen it comes to characters, I feel like the show doesn't really focus on this as much with the Kaiju fights. Sure, the characters have personalities but only 2 relationships (I'm being vague in order to avoid potentially major spoiler) are the only ones that's interesting and has some actual progress despite the amount of characters. For me it's fair, nothing more nothing less.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nThis show really takes me back to the times when I was still 6-7 years old watching the Ultraman series. The combining scenes, the beam scenes, it really makes me feel like an innocent child when I don't say a show or some form of entertainment is bad because it's bad, but because I don't enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nSSSS. Gridman is a show designed to be a homage to classic Tokusatsu series and it does it job greatly to the point it became one of my most favorite anime ever.",

SSSS.Gridman on the other hand is not like any of those kinds of anime. It instead mainly focuses on one boy doing the fighting with support from supernatural beings instead of actualmilitary equipment, and it takes place most of the time out of school and the school that is present in this anime doesn't really have a connection to anything mecha related in the anime, it just shows some character backgrounds.",

Imagine that right when you think the good part is going to happen, there are tones of romance that are never met and it seems like more questions come than are answered.\r\n It's just typical Trigger at this point, niceart, nice animations, but story still isn't their strong suit anymore it seems. I like the show, and I want to recommend it to people but I just can't do that, it's a polished turd at best. \\n\\n\r\nOnto Characters now. Designs are good. Most characters you get a feel for their personality, but after a while you don't see any really growth to the characters and it just seems like their personality becomes spastic as the show goes on.\\n\\n\r\nAgain.

            "content": "Just personal scratch.\r\nAdvised, possible spoilers.\r\nOpinion & Informal\r\nArt: 6/10\r\nArt was mixed. The anatomy and proportions of the human characters checked out and the non-human characters looked pretty neat too. The kaiju looked cheesy but they fit well with the style of the show. I thought the art was mixed because the quality could vary between below average and pretty good-looking. Zoomed out shots of characters looked pretty bad honestly (worse than what you'd expect is what I mean): dots for eyes, minimal detail and coloring, etc. Closeups of characters, however, looked good. There was a lot of detail in closeup shots that I appreciate. The luminescentand detailed eyes, the hair-work and facial expressions looked nice. The environmentals and supporting details looked good. Panoramic shots added a lot of atmosphere to the narrative and the fact that they looked good too is a plus. I gave this area a 6 because the clear drop in quality in often-enough select moments bothered me. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation 7/10\\n\r\nAnimation was good. Action was thrilling and created hype. Character movements such as walking, running, and gestures looked believable and were fairly crisp. Impact sequences had a drop in detail but looked nice. CGI elements and sequences didn't look weird and hit their mark. There was some select-framing in anything that wasn't cgi, but it's fine. Not too many shortcuts taken such as dropping frames.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\r\nCharacters were great. The character development is what I liked most about this show. The particular events of the show somewhat make up for the lack of development and presence of some of the characters such as the Evangelion crew, Utsumi, and even Yuuta. Akane's development more than made up for my few gripes about the time spent on the rest of the cast because this show was more or less Akane's story.\\n\\n\r\nPlot: 6/10\\n\r\nThe slow and vague plot setup this show decided to go with really isn't my style when it comes to world-building and narrative but I eventually grew into and and began to appreciate it by the end. At first I was a bit annoyed, asking myself lots of questions: Who is he? Why haven't I been hinted at why Yuuta has amnesia this far into the show? Why hasn't Calibur been explained or why was just shoe'd in so nonchalantly? What's up with those giant kaiju statues? I wasn't really into how the show refused to address a lot of these questions for quite some time, but by the end the narrative direction from start to finish really played out well so I don't think of the vague startup as too much of a negative anymore.\\n\\n\r\nDevelopment: 8/10\\n\r\nThe development was all worth it. I enjoyed the action, but I really bought Akane's development. It was really neat when events slowly lead to the shift in perspective; that the whole thing was an exercise in Akane gaining the confidence to leave her imaginary world behind and take the \"first steps\" towards opening that \"door.\" \\n\\n\r\nMusic: 5/10\\n\r\nMostly the same theme song during almost every fight. No sound design to note. Soundboard was fitting as well. OP and ED were cool. Favorite was just the main theme song which was pretty catchy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nI'm happy that TRIGGER went with something more story-driven this time around rather than their usual shounen-esq formula. I saw a lot of nice-looking animation that I would expect from TRIGGER, but there were cases of \"quality\" art that bothered me. This is worth picking up for the neat narrative direction.",

            "content": "A faithful tokosatsu homage with art house tendencies, Gridman is (pun intended!) more than meets the eye. \r\nWriting-wise, this is probably Trigger's most concise and focused show to date (sans shorter projects like Luluco and Inferno Cop, ofc). \r\nThe control of information throughout the series keeps the character beats and revelations unpredictable, the world-building vague but just clear enough to keep us engaged. \r\nBut the biggest thing that I love about this show is its sense of balance. \r\nAs aforementioned, SSSS Gridman is a tokusatsu, through and through. It keeps the familiar tropes and borrows elements from the genre's writing formulas, while also ensuring itsmain crowd-pleasers in the form of the titular Gridman and the monsters he fights are familiarly-over the top, making sure that fans of toksatsu and kaiju are given a very nostalgic trip down memory lane. \\n\\n\r\nBut at the same time, SSSS Gridman makes sure from the first few minutes that the world it inhabits is not as it seems. \\n\\n\r\nFor all of the ground-level circling panning shots with Gridman and kaiju beating the shit out of each other, there's as many uncomfortable long takes. For every flashy transformation scene, there is tightly-edited conversation reminiscent of trends seen in mumblecore. \\n\\n\r\nFor every flamboyant tokusatsu element, there is a very subdued, instrospective art house element, which would have many a keen viewer reminisce not of Ultraman and the like, but of Neon Genesis Evangelion.\\n\\n\r\nThis juxtaposition of flash and long introspection surprisingly works to the show's benefit, lending to the eeriness of this world with something awry (other than the giant mecha and killer monsters lol). \\n\\n\r\nOne particular element of the show that really solidifies that juxtaposition is its sound design. \\n\\n\r\nMost of the show is DEVOID of any music, highlight the background music of a store, the sound of pencil against paper, traffic driving by. That, combined with the realistic handling of dialogue (people talking over another, conversations in the background continuing even when main characters are talking, main characters acting naturally and cohorting with side characters without any restrictions) really lent to the atmosphere of the show and making the world of SSSS Gridman seem realistic, something I would not have expected from a show that features a giant robotman fighting giant deformed monsters.\\n\\n\r\nAnd when there IS music, it's the most hammiest, cheesiest tokusatsu music you can imagine, again just highlighting the intense juxtaposition of what's real and what's stylistically fake.\\n\\n\r\nThat intense relative realism playing around with the hammed-up intense cheese of the main setpieces was a fantastic stylistic choice that not only kept me engaged, but surprisingly lent itself to the plot itself, leaving clues to the conclusion of all the plot threads and mysteries in an extremely satisfying way that couldn't have been done WITHOUT that intense juxtaposition throughout the anime, from the sound design to the character design, to the shot compositions. \\n\\n\r\nJuxtaposition aside, SSSS Gridman really took me offguard. \\n\\n\r\nI expected something that was intentionally super-schlocky or some mediocre shonen monster of the week show with horrible CGI, but what I got was this very over the top yet grounded meditation on escapism, the nature of reality, and free will, with colorful and pulse-pounding action setpieces that made me feel like a 12 year old all over again. \\n\\n\r\nIt's such a unique yet loving homage that I legit feltl nostalgic for Superhuman Samurai Syber-Squad and Gridman The Hyper Agent even though I've never watched either incarnation. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I think that's probably the best thing the creators could have asked for.\\n\\n\r\n...and the fact that Rikka's thighs can probably form a religion. Bless Rikka. \\n",

            "content": "Story: SSSS.Gridman's story keeps following the tradition of original anime series produced by Trigger, since the time the team worked in Gainax. This tradition that comes from Evangelion, Gurren Laggan and recently Darling in the franxx have at its core two root elements: Giant Robots and Gnosticism. This formula may have dragged many fans over the time but it's getting more and more predictable and boring. They try to give it a new cover mixing elements from tokusatsus, from which the original Gridman comes. It does add a special flavor to this whole gnostic experience, but it's questionable if that flavor really harmonizes with therest of it. Tokusatsus are known to be really straight forward and the good guys fighting the bad guys. Adding things like false evil gods, false realities and mysterious women from beyond dimension may be compared to adding fruits inside your spaghetti: an unusual mixture that may please some, but disgust many. In general it was a interesting experience for me, that in my childhood watched tokusatsus even before knowing that genre existed, and also since I have watched many gnostic giant robot animes, all from gainax/trigger, except Code Geass, from sunrise, and that's why it's much better. \\n\r\nArt: pretty good art, including characters, robots, scenario.. it was pleasing to my eyes.\\n\r\nSound: the soundtrack didn't catch my attention. It did not annoyed me at any moment, though. The opening song is good, and is constantly showing throughout the episodes. \\n\r\nCharacter: As it was in last Trigger original anime (darling in the franxx) the characters are very well conceived and well developed throughout the serie, considering the lack time to develop them more. Rikka is absolutely among the best waifus of the year. the protagonist don't act too much stupidly that you want to punch him. \\n\r\nEnjoyment: the repetitiveness of tokusatus allied to the predictability of Triggers original animes really hindered me to fully enjoy the show. many times I preferred to do other things than to keep watching the anime. I don't regret keep watching it, though. the final episode brought a good finishing for the series, a thing that I didn't expect from Trigger. It was nice to know that they can do it if they want to. \\n\r\nOverall, I recommend it to people that like tokusatsus and gainax/trigger original animes, and want to watch a short anime with closed ending, no ongoing original material, etc.",

The only reason I watched it was because I kept seeing the hype of Rikka Takarada's thighs. \r\nYes, they were THICC. Yes, I was impressed. No, it wasn't the main focus of the anime. But it should've been. \r\nGoing in with low expectations, I was genuinely surprised of how good the animation and soundtrack was. I thought CGI robots fighting CGI monsters in an animated landscape would suck. It turns out it was pretty great. (At least in the beginning) AND THAT OPENING SONG. That songslaps, HARD. \\n\\n\r\nThe first half of the anime was pretty decent. I really enjoyed the fight scenes. The story had enough mystery to keep me interested, but gave me enough insight so I wasn't completely confused. And I listened to the opening song every time, which is a rare occurrence. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, during the second half of the anime, my enjoyment began to decline. The fights weren't as fun to watch. I don't know if it was because they just weren't as cool as the ones in the beginning or because I just became used to the repetitive similar fights that happened in almost every episode. \\n\\n\r\nThe story itself became really confusing. It was still interesting, but kind of hard to follow. \\n\r\nThe ending was pretty rushed in my opinion. But, I definitely called that ending.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, it was an alright anime. I would watch it because the fights were pretty great early on. And the thighs too. AND THAT OP",

            "content": "Do you remember during parent-teacher interviews, when your teacher would turn to your mum and dad and say \"Johnny has so much potential, he just needs to apply himself in class.\" I always hated that, especially when it was followed with the familiar side-eye of disappointment.\r\nIf you thought receiving that dirty look was bad, watching SSSS.Gridman finally gives you the opportunity to realise that giving that look is so much worse.\r\nUnderstandably, the show is a mecha anime - but this does not exonerate it from tarnishing the development of its few interesting characters and plot threads to push toys in the form of CGI robotbrawls. In the end, most elements of Gridman do an average job, yet the show is inconsistent in its plot devices.\\n\\n\r\n**Spoilers**\\n\r\nCharacter \\n\r\nThere are two interesting characters in the show. Akane and Rikka. They interact with every other character, and in turn their relationships are what seem to be the most important. The main boys, Utsuma and the kid that gridman possessed, experience very few developments outside of shallow \"im mad,\" and \"i realised im a robot.\" It's uninspiring to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nDon't even bother with the toys. The loli, mask guy, handsome guy and samurai are literally just there to transform into toys. Funny because their personalities amount to the hunks of plastic they were made to sell.\\n\\n\r\nSound and Art\\n\r\nI'm going to clump these two together for efficiency's sake. \\n\r\nThe art is decent, expressions convey emotions and landscapes are pretty. The CGI isn't awful either, but good lord they need to tone it down. The final fight between Gridman and Alexa began with a 2d sequence which was extremely impressive. Yet, the rest of the shows action consists of clunky CGI models beating each other until Gridman won.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\nThis is where it all goes downhill for me. \\n\r\nFor those that have finished the show - the post credit scene introduces very many interesting ideas. These ideas place the show under a new lens, as each character lends themself as a personification of our 3d girl's psyche. Is Akane an embodiment of her selfish desires, while Rikka acts as a standard of morality and compassion that desperately struggles with co-existing alongside dark, abrasive desires of human nature. \\n\r\nSike, if you wanted that all you get is robots fighting.\\n\r\nIt feels like such a waste, an interesting idea and premise which is ruined by 7-8 minutes of mindless robots and monsters bashing each other. If the fights were there to serve as more than \"move story forward and sell toys,\" perhaps Gridman would feel more satisfying and fulfilling as a show. Currently, every fight scene has no stakes, distracts from the rare interesting characters and is generally a waste of time. The potential to use conflict as important character development sequences is no foreign idea within all forms of media, so there is very little excuse for Gridman to simply shoehorn in mediocre CGI action sequences (outside of selling toys).\\n\\n\r\nI am infinitely disappointed that such a good plot twist is wasted on such a shallow show.\\n\\n\r\nI unhappily glare at this show with the familiar ire of \"so much potential wasted.\" 3/10",

            "content": "Through all the anime I have watched, the Mecha genre has never really stood out to me. Few and far between do I find one which keeps me engaged and enthralled, usually finding that I'm missing a key component that makes me want more, and it doesn't ever sit right with me. As a person who enjoys previous works by studio Trigger, I took it upon myself to give SSSS.Gridman a fighting chance. Surprisingly, it didn't ever give me that something more, but kept me intrigued with \"less.\"\r\nWhat you just read may come across as a shock to you, especially since you most likely haveno idea where I'm going with this. How could a show with \"lesser\" substance be that something more I have looked for in a Mecha series? Through simple and effective, childlike entertainment. I honestly and truly felt akin to being a young child, opening a new Lego set for the first time. The story was simple and detached from anything unnecessary, portraying a simple premise and setting with little to no explanation, but visual representation of the world. The artistic design choice by Trigger, albeit sometimes clunky and humorous CGI brought about feelings of actual toy robots and monsters in a childlike dream world. The sound effects, music and impressively simple minded tracks containing a heroic charm got me pumped and ready for some innocent and fun kaiju battles. Second to none of course to Triggers beautiful and expressive delivery of it's characters and interactions left me feeling blissful.\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment with the series had me continuing to come back each week unboxing that little new Lego set that kept me motivated to come back for more each time a new episode had aired. This was a unique experience to me, as it has continued my ever growing dabbling into the Mecha genre, but to be fair I cannot be expected to find what I enjoyed about it in more anime of a similar formula. Refreshing, simplistic and easy to take in, I implore you to give this show a shot if you to want to experience a not so heavy commitment that gives off a straightforward childlike charm.",

            "content": "SSSS.Gridman has always been a mystery to me. I always find the show when looking for Japanese related media, but given the age of the show, I always thought it was a classic from a previous generation similar to Star Trek. A show to be remembered but not to be taken seriously. Well after hearing trigger was doing an adaption of one of the older shows I decided that now was better than never.\r\nStory: An underwhelming beginning that seems to lead nowhere, but was that the point? The first episodes can only be described as boring, bland and unstructured. It\u2019s episodic in nature with nextto no development of any kind and the characters couldn\u2019t be weaker. At episode 6 I was willing to drop the show entirely, which is very rare for me especially this far in but by continuing on I was in for a surprise. The next half of the show took an entire 180 approach to the story and really change the perception of where they were going. The story made some really interesting twists and threw the characters into a curveball I did not see coming. I believe the large contrast of the first half to the last half was to subvert the expectations of the viewers and try to appeal to older fans. Trigger knows the \u201cmonster of the week\u201d trope doesn\u2019t work in today\u2019s age but at the same time, they can\u2019t abandon the legacy of the show as well. But presenting the show as its original structure then changing the show into a more modern appeal they get best of both worlds(albeit the beginning reception of the show wasn\u2019t the best because of it). The characters also follow this idea very closely and how they develop through the story. Most if not all get flushed out in the second half rather then first because of the above story structuring, except for the main character. Yuta was incredibly shallow and never once showed any significant emotion or progression. While many of the characters were questioning themselves or challenging themselves to do something, Yuta was absolutely hollow. It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve seen the main character this poorly written but luckily the rest of the cast picks up the slack and somehow pulls the story along. I would like to state that at times there\u2019s references or mentions of the \u201cpredecessor\u201d for Gridman. I have no idea what that means or who that is and it never gets explained at all, because of this I believe I\u2019m missing some critical information towards the plot since it\u2019s apart of the ultra series. Above all else, the story wasn\u2019t drawn out to its full potential but the ending was better than expected.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: With it being studio Trigger you can already tell what style animation will be used. Rather here it\u2019s how effective the animation was used. Studio Trigger definitely doesn\u2019t like to have a lot of still idle images in there works, their art style fully shines when in scenes of action and quick movement. The problem is that it's not necessarily used for action scenes of the show but rather some really impressive special effects and what I believe is CGI. But in return when it\u2019s only used for a majority that isn\u2019t quick motions it heavily drags the showdown in quality and feels. It almost seems like I\u2019m watching something out of 2011 rather than the current year and that\u2019s not a compliment. I will add that the show was made by all new animators from studio Trigger so while the typical animation is as sharp the future looks really bright for Trigger. \\n\\n\r\nMusic: I was ecstatic to hear that Shirou Sagisu was creating the soundtrack for the show and with him being one of my favorite composers of all time I really want to hear it succeed. Unfortunately, it was not what I expected, but wasn\u2019t bad in any regard. The soundtrack mostly composes of EDM and more then half the OST is made up of alternative versions for the soundtrack, meaning there\u2019s not much there to listen to. I did enjoy one song being HumanLove_CH_edm_all which, for the most part, is pretty plain but at least it spices it up with some interesting variations. Overall, it was a soundtrack to fit a type of show rather than be more experiential like Shirou's other soundtracks.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: If you find joy in watching old style fights and have nothing better to watch then go for SSSS.Gridman but other than that I wouldn\u2019t recommend the show to really anyone. You can find it legally streaming on Crunchyroll with a home release not yet announced.",

Having only the necessary compartments and structure required for artillery deployment would seem to be the most reasonable approach as it reduces material needs, construction costs and power consumption, which leads to the creation of efficient and cost-effective machines that are easier to deploy and can withstand constant use at larger time frames. Mecha shows, to me, are literally \"throwing the middle-finger\" at the very fact, and saying that, in some odd future, everyone cared so much about aesthetics that battle machines were made to look like mammals.\\n\\n\r\nBeing over-conscious of facts such as these, it's really hard to bring myself to watch a mecha/gundam show. But having excessive hype surrounding the show, I decided to give it a try. \\n\\n\r\n## END OF BORING SECTION ##\\n\\n\r\nAnimation was absolutely solid and smooth, often accompanying appropriate color tones to bring out the atmosphere. And of course, there's also heavy usage of chromatic aberration in some particular scenes. \\n\\n\r\nPlot execution and progression was decent, but it was nothing out of the ordinary. The typical \"last episodes are probably the climax, where they suddenly escalate to dire situations at insane speeds relative to the entire show\".\\n\\n\r\nEverything else was on par with above-average animes, the characters were quite distinct, but improvements can definitely be made to delve deeper and fully explore each character's traits. The only thing that I thought was truly outstanding, or rather less seen in average animes, is the appropriate use of background music (I usually detest anime music) and the effective recreation of the atmosphere (only) at certain scenes. I'm emphasizing particularly on recreating atmospheres, indefinitely an 8/10, when done correctly.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, would I recommend this anime to a non-mecha fellow? \\n\\n\r\nProbably, if he cares about scavenging quality in piles of anime laying around.\\n\\n\r\nBut, do keep in mind that as it is still a mecha anime at the end of the day, certain elements might put you off as they are often illogical (but they are supposedly needed elements of a mecha anime).",

            "content": "*Disclaimer: I don't have a background in the Tokusatsu genre other than occasionally being in the room when my kid brother was watching the original Power Rangers back in the 90's and seeing maybe... 1(?) episode of Ultraman about 25-30 years ago*\r\nTL:DR at the end. Show starts off slow and with almost every character giving off distinct unreliable narrator vibes. \r\nI'm guessing this explains all the negative press from Trigger-haters or those expecting this to be the second coming of TTGL, etc.\r\nIf you have a bit of patience as a viewer it quickly (within 2-3 episodes) becomes apparent that there is much more going onbehind the scenes which neither the characters in-universe nor we the audience understand. \\n\r\nI don't mind this approach to story telling so I actually found myself growing increasingly invested with each episode. 9 and 10 were masterpieces - hopefully they can keep the momentum going strong for the last remaining episode.\\n\\n\r\nMuch like the relatively small but very vocal extreme negative responses to Trigger/A1's Darling in the FranXX earlier this year I don't understand people giving Gridman ratings of 1 or 2 at all. \\n\\n\r\nEven if you hate the story or think the show is pure \"waifu bait \" (or whatever!) it's hard to ignore that there is still so much good stuff going on here - from art to animation to voice acting the production on this show is generally pretty damn awesome... And the few references I do get (to NGE for example) are really well done so kudos to the creators.\\n\r\nI guess I just don't understand a reviewer trying to maintain even a facade of being \"balanced\" or \"fair\" when rating shows giving scores that low to an animated show of this (high) quality because they're displeased with 1 or 2 aspects (or the studio making it). \\n\\n\r\nYou may not like Trigger but you've got to admit, they('ve got style) rarely release anything that doesn't at least have good-to-great production values.\\n\r\nI'm giving this a 9 so far and I could maybe understand scores of 6-7 if you really had a bone to pick with the show... but ratings of 1, 2, etc. seem pretty ridiculous and almost like protest scores selected for the sole design of purposefully lowering Gridman's overall rating out of spite. \\n\\n\r\nMy only real complaint with Gridman thus far is one of aesthetics/personal taste: I'm not a huge fan of the CGI kaiju fight scenes (I'm not a fan of mixed trad-animation with CGI in general) - although, I'll admit, they actually do do it well.. so well that I sometimes ALMOST forget that it's CGI. But again, this is a purely preferential thing so I can't really knock the show for it.\\n\\n\r\nTL:DR - IMHO it's a great show. If you don't mind a bit of a slow burn introduction to the universe with a main plot which develops slowly via subtle hints, background details, and characterization - in between fights with monstrous kaiju - I highly recommend checking it out.",

            "content": "AS I ALWAYS DO, THIS IS SPOILER FREE\r\nTLDR: 5/7/10/8/8 Overall 8* *see bottom I had to update this\r\nI watched the first episode of Gridman and was underwhelmed. I didn't watch any more until much later. Now that I'm 4 eps in, I want to write a review. If you are watching this show after it has aired, I should mention something. The show was PANNED its first few weeks but gained a steady following. As I found with my own viewing, it's something you need to stick with. That being said, if you don't like it after ep2, I say you should drop it.\r\nI thinkthe thing that matters most to whether you'll enjoy Gridman or not is your sense of nostalgia. The show's charm comes from the fact that its style is reminiscent of past styles. Long shots, cicada background noises, the setting, the monster styles, they're all very 1990s and early 2000s. I found myself thinking a LOT of Evangelion, not in the Mecha aspects or the character archetypes, but the way the scenes are displayed. A detailed, expanded shot of mundane things, like a girl mashed an elevator-close button that won't work, is similar to long panning shots of, say, Shinji just standing there while his Ramen cooked. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 5/10. This is by far the weakest aspect of the show. It really thrusts you into the middle of the events with little explanation or backstory. The \"amnesia\" trope is pretty lame, it lets them get away without establishing any backstory. I'll include my thoughts on the fights. From what I've seen so far, they just keep getting better. Gridman starts off pretty lame and slow but just gets cooler as the story progresses.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10. I think it's pretty well drawn. This is where I'm least able to critique because I have low standards. I will say the CGI is pretty well-done. The weakest aspects so far are the first few Kaiju, and also the style of the MC. His fire-red hair with two \"hair horns\" looks so stupid. And his best friend has booger-green hair too, wtf. But Rikka really looks good, no wonder everyone is into the thiccness.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10. This show has an AWESOME soundtrack. Not just the OP/ED, but also the fight songs are so good. I'm watching the dub because I'm lazy and to me the english VAs are pretty good. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10. Sadly, the MC (Hibiki) is probably the worst character in the show. He's boring, he has no backstory since he has amnesia, and he's kinda whiny sometimes, but not in the understandable Shinji way (since I mentioned Eva). The cast is really carried by Rikka. She has an interesting personality and to me, sometimes she seems to be more of the focus than Hibiki. The best friend is meh, I don't even know his name yet. The supporting characters that show up as the show goes on are great additions, and they help a lot. Gridman himself is interesting but not anything more than that.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10. Despite its flaws, it's fun anime to watch. It has hallmarks of mecha, SoL, comedy, and drama. It won't blow your mind but I think it's worth a shot.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10. I wouldn't say \"if you like mecha you'll like this\" because that isn't true. I'd say \"if you like old school 1990s anime, you'll like this\". \\n\\n\r\nUPDATE: I previously had the overall at a 7. I bumped it up to 8 after catching up to the episode (8). This show really gets better and better as you watch. Hibiki is still meh but all the other characters are so great.",

            "content": "Gridman's world building and characterization are its biggest flaws as well as its biggest strengths. \r\nRight off the bat, Trigger introduces viewers to a relatively simplistic mecha anime in which something about the Gridman world seems...off. Trigger gradually builds the world throughout the rest of the episodes. Though the way they go about developing characters and the world of SSSS. Gridman can easily leave viewers questioning the show's quality in terms of writing. I feel this is what has lead to users here at MAL giving this anime a much lower score than it deserves. \r\nThis anime needs a lot of investment for a viewerto receive any sort of payoff. In a way, I feel that Gridman tries to not just be shounen, mecha anime which can either be refreshing or revolting to a viewer. If you like mecha or sci-fi in general and are willing to be flexible and very patient with plot/character/world development, then SSSS. Gridman is for you.",
