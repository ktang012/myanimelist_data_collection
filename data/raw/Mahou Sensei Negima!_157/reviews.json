            "content": "Before I start this review, take into consideration that when I watched this, I did not read a single chapter of the manga yet. This was also the first anime I was hooked on.   \r\nDuring my last vacation to America, I got bored. So bored that I resorted to waching anime in desperation. When I first heard about Mahou Sensei Negima, I decided to give it a shot and watch it. I was surprised at what I had stumbled upon. \r\nThe story was very original. I'd never expect a 10 year old teacher who teaches in an all girl's school. To make thingsmore interesting, he's also a magician. To make things spicier, the class he teaches is full of strange and interesting people such as a vampire, a person from the future, a robot etc. The combination of all these weird, crazy and wacky ideas makes the series really interesting to watch.\\n\\n\r\nNow the animation is the series' weakest point. Everything looks like it was colored with watercolor. Everything looked kinda pale and lightish is hue. Also, the characters could have been drawn a lot better.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is where the series really shines. The opening and ending themes are really cute and are very addicting to listen to. 4 months after watching Mahou Sensei Negima, I'm still not bored of the songs. \\n\\n\r\nThe series also has the best bgms I have ever heard. They are composed so well that they could rival Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter development was good. The relationship Negi had with some of his students was shown pretty well. My only problem was some of the students in Negi's class were given so little airtime that I couldn't remember who they were much less thier names. Well with a class of 31, it's obvious this problem could not be avoided. \\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I enjoyed Mahou Sensei Negima. It was fun and entertaining to watch and it took away most of my boredom. It even made me shed a tear or two. But after reading part of the manga, I can say that the manga totally owns the series XD.",

            "content": "A comedy series full of stupid fun and fan service, for you to enjoy. However this Shounen anime seems to be aimed more at the female demographic, leaving most guys cringing at all the cuteness. ^_^\r\nNegima! is a Magical, Supernatural, Harem, Comedy about 10 year old boy Negi, who has become a teacher at an all girls school. There's one other shocking piece of info about him and that is, he's a Mage (Magician).\r\nWell that's the basic idea of this simple show and what helps it stand out is the shear number of girls (31 in fact), so learning their names are impossible. Even thoughthis harem, comedy has the advantage of being a magical one it seems to start of fairly normally, which can be quite dull for anime fans that are used to this genre. The story manages to become good and fun to watch at times, but with its cheesy outcomes it may leave little to be desired. With a pretty basic story, the romance is what supposed to help keep it going however he male protagonist is only 10 and with 14-15 year old girls it can be really hard to take it seriously. So throughout the show it has to rely on the slapstick comedy and fan service, which can be pretty weak at times.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation quality is as basic as it can get, with not an ounce of detail put into it at all. Because this is a comedy it could be forgiven however there actually is a fair bit of action in this series, which is quite disappointing to watch. The music is there but it does absolutely nothing to help and is just there to fill in the silence.\\n\\n\r\nTo summarize Negima! It had the potential of being one of the greatest harems, having every single type of anime girl crammed in, but the fact that Negi is a 10 year old teacher is just far to unbelievable. At least the story improves in the 2nd half where some of the girls are individually developed however it had to rely on a shocking tear-jerking moment in the end. The majority of the negative issues were addressed in the 2nd series (Negima!?) but the fact still remains that this is an overrated series that doesn't really deserve the recognition it has.\\n\r\n^_^",

            "content": "Negima, also known as Mahou Sensei Negima, Negima Magister Magi Negi and numerous other titles, is based on a long-running manga by Ken Akamatsu, best known for the archetype-setting harem series Love Hina. Love Hina was adapted by Xebec, and subjected to a not-particularly-great adaptation. Negima is almost the same in that respect, except that rather than a not-particularly-great adaptation, here we are presented with an appalling one. \r\nFor starters, this series came out several years sooner than it should have done. The manga is, to this day, still running, and promises to be around 40-50 volumes in length by its completion. This, however, wasmade when they were still only few volumes in. When Akamatsu was going to make this series, he wanted to make a Shonen manga, but was forced to make a harem manga in an attempt to repeat the success of Love Hina. As a result, he kicked off with a blatant harem setup, and gradually shifted away to becoming a Shonen series instead. In the process, it eventually became something of a Shonen manga for Harem fans.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, while battle Shonen series are increasingly becoming a patch on the anime industry, with repetitive fights, contrived plots, one-dimensional characters, and optimal capability to be completely recycled by another series with a quick, unconvincing makeover, the Negima manga is absolutely none of those. Negima knows what it is, and gleefully runs through all the battle shonen tropes and harem tropes in hilarious tongue-in-cheek fashion. But even while happily resigning itself to being a generic shonen series, it manages to be utterly exemplary as one, building three-dimensional characters, rich fantasy worlds, plots that skilfully manage god knows how many characters and still manage to make most of them interesting an memorable, fights that are well-constructed and compelling, and humour that is outright hilarious. In effect, Negima is something that every shonen series should strive to be.\\n\\n\r\nThat is, however, something this series decides to completely ignore. It kicks off mostly faithful to the first part of the series, but promptly decides to deviate whenever any of the story arcs pop up. Yes, rather than actually following the plot of Negima, regarding Negi's exploits to find his long-lost father, they just decide to do... well, pretty much nothing. All the series ever focuses on are the protagonist Negi Springfield's day-to-day activities as the teacher of an all-girl high school. In a nutshell, what this is series has done is taken every piece of filler from the manga and put it together into a series. The only time they really touch on any of the manga's story arcs is the Kyoto arc, which took about 3 volumes of the manga to cover. They then proceed to dedicate about 2 episodes on this, cutting out pretty much everything of importance, and cutting a major character (Kotaro) out of the story altogether. The end result is a rushed and butchered version of what was previously a good story arc.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, Negima is a character-driven series, which it would really have to be considering that it starts off with around 35 characters, and in the current arc of the manga it must be nearing 100. Problem is that the series stops at around 45, and only remembers to make a handful or two remotely interesting. The only ones that are really worth mentioning are as follows: Negi, our protagonist, a ten year old Welsh magician. As part of their training, young wizards are sent off to work to test their abilities, with Negi's test being to teach a school of Japanese students who are older than he is. He has a fantastic backstory that spans childhood horrors, parental abandonment, and a crippling need to become a great wizard for reason I won't dare spoil. This adaptation covers approximately none of it.\\n\\n\r\nWe also see his first of many sidekicks, Asuna Kagurazaka, whose backstory digs so far back that I can't even say a word of it without spoiling anybody. But naturally, not a single bit of it was adapted, so we are left with a one-dimensional character who is bossy and annoying. It's worth noting that even in the manga she's not particularly likeable. We also have Evangeline A.K. McDowell, a vampire who was imprisoned in the school by Negi's father and needs Negi's blood to escape, Nodoka Miyazaki, the clumsy, hyper-moe bookworm girl and primary love interest, and Yue Ayase, friend of Nodoka and general deadpan snarker. Other than that, most of the remaining 40-something cast members aren't used much. Some of them get their episodes in the spotlight, but none of them ever really shine as a result. Several cast members get as many as one or two lines in the entire series. Some others are also quite out of character, in particular Sayo Aisaka, the ghost.\\n\\n\r\nOn the technical side of things, Negima is as poor as it is anywhere else. The animation is awful, littered with animation mistakes absolutely everywhere, and the colouring is horribly bland and undersaturated. The music is all either annoying J-pop or completely forgettable. Negima was a series I watched before I was in the habit of watching subbed series, so I regretfully sat through the horrible dubbing. Don't get me wrong, I actually like dubs, but this is a really bad one. Greg Ayres as Negi is the highlight of how bad it gets. Effectively, Ayres is the Michael Cera of English dubbed anime. He has a distinctive, whiny voice, that can either be amusing, loveable and endearing, or horribly annoying. And the absolute pinnacle of just how annoying Greg Ayres can be when casted poorly is Negi Springfield. His voice is, in addition to its usual nasally whine, made considerable higher and given something of a British accent. To simulate the experience of hearing this, find your nearest chalkboard and scrape your nails down it. Despite the large cast, there are very few decent performances here (Brina Palencia as Yue Ayase and Laura Bailey as Evangeline A.K. McDowell are the only good ones in here), as well as several other irritating ones such as Leah Clark (Nodoka) and Monica Rial (Konoka) both putting in extremely shrill voices, with the remainder of the cast simply being either poor or unremarkable.\\n\\n\r\nAt this point I'm sure that several readers are annoyed at how much I've prattled on about the differences in the adaptation, but the thing is that when you take that away there is very little to talk about. When depleted of all the manga's positives, what we are left with is a series that is honestly lifeless. The comedy is mostly absent, and when it does it falls flat. None of the characters are enjoyable in the least. The plot is almost nonexistent. This series doesn't even have any fanservice to carry it for the lowest common denominator (ecchi fans).\\n\\n\r\nBeing an ongoing series, Negima of course had an anime-exclusive ending. While it was very contrived and the drama was laid on awfully thick, the plot itself honestly wasn't that bad and at least saves this anime from being absolutely, 100% terrible, alongside a very small handful of funny moments.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, Negima has since left the hands of Xebec, and moves into those of Shaft. Shaft have gone on to make a TV series that is essentially Negima in name only, although it is still a damn sight better than this, two random filler OVAs, and most likely due to complaints, two series of OVAs covering later arcs in the manga, which are easily the best animated chunks of Negima. Sadly, this pretty much rules out any kind of full series adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nThanks,  Xebec. You ruined it.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Words: For the love of god, buy the manga first.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation/Graphics: 1/10\\n\r\nStory/Plot: 2/10\\n\r\nCharacters; 3/10\\n\r\nMusic/Background: 4/10\\n\r\nEnglish Dub: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nFor Fans Of: Love Hina, Harry Potter.",

I mean, it all wounds up in the last episode, but you can tell the story doesn't stop there(that actually led me to the manga , - that continued for several more years after the anime ended - which I started reading after the finale).\r\nSo, I think the concept isactually quite good, Negi Springfield is a Wizard apprentice who has to complete a mission in order to become a minister magi, and that mission is to be the teacher for a middle school class at an all girls boarding school. It can be kinda difficult if we take in account that he's a 10 years old boy. during his teaching period we get to follow some of his adventures with the all magic world getting entangled with his school teaching world, while getting to know his students bit by bit.\\n\r\nThe story is kinda slow developing at first, and it's a bit rushed in the last 4/5 episodes, yet it's still quite enjoyable.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nI would give it a 6,5 but well, there goes a 7.\\n\r\nAkamatsu's art is really pretty and clean and detailed, and somehow i think the animation was a little below that if you see the original art and compare it with the one in this series. Is not bad, it could just be a little better I think.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8 \\n\r\nThe staff that adapted the whole manga into an anime had a though job with character development, if you think about it.\\n\r\nIt consists in Negi Kun, 31 students plus the school staff, and they all appeared frequently in each episode. In only 26 episodes you couldn't possibly ask fo lots of character development with so many characters, still you got to know most f them at a superficial level, and in the overall they're all really likeable and spiffy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nOkay, i really liked the all package. It was a really enjoyable story, about young love, crushes, friendship, growth, and a fairly happy ending, and I gotta say, I'm really a sucker for happy endings.",

            "content": "Watch episode 19, then pretend the rest of the series doesn't exist. Rarely does the series succeed in rising above the mark of generic in any aspect, more often taking advantage of being an adaptation of a work by Ken Akamatsu and assuming fans will mindlessly race to hand over money (which they did).\r\nMany fans laud the anime for originality because it features a harem surrounding a preteen teacher who happens to be a wizard. However, the magical aspect is used only infrequently, as are the child-teacher jokes. The preteen harem lead aspect is used fairly often, but is of limited improvement over the typicalspineless loser harem lead.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNegima's most obvious problem is the visual. The art is unpleasing, and the animation is lackluster. For all the vibrant colors, the characters look flat and lack dynamic. The action scenes are done so lazily, such as Negi's battle with Eva in episode 8, that they are almost painful to watch. The quality was so bad that Xebec had to change the entire animation team about halfway through the series and reanimated the earlier episodes for DVD release. While this was an improvement, it is akin to stating that dog food tastes better than chalk; much of the series only matches the quality of shows ten years older. Also, while generally a rainbow of hair colors is common to distinguish characters who look similar among a large cast, how many other series make fun of that point in the actual dub.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe dub cast was not really a strong point of the show either. While there weren't any bad performances, unless you couldn't stand Greg Ayres attempt to speak in a pitch several octaves above normal to play Negi, the number of characters required several actresses to play multiple roles. This in itself is not exactly a problem, except that in many cases the drastic efforts they made to sound distinctly different did not match the character. The Japanese audio track would be preferable, except that the English script took liberties with the dialogue that made the series if not interesting, more tolerable. \\n\\n\r\nThe music - background, OP, ED, all of it - was like audio cotton candy: light, fluffy, and sugary. A perfect, borderline obnoxious, match for the visual pallet of the series. \\n\\n\\n\r\nI've mentioned before that the cast of the show is rather large, and that is another of its failings. It is unreasonable to assume that over 30 characters could be properly fleshed out and given interesting backgrounds, but the anime was unwilling to concede screen time from the ensemble to allow individual characters to be given their 15 minutes of fame. Ayaka's story, for instance, had potential to be touching and personal, but the animators felt compelled to include the generic madcap hijinx of the rest of class 3-A. Such an inclusion did nothing to expand the personalities of any other characters, as the only character-specific goofy antics were based around the one-dimensional stereotypes the girls were slotted into. Seeing a robot go on an accidental rampage because someone pushed the wrong button is barely amusing the first time it happens, but in Negima it serves to undermine the nature of the character because lazy writers can only think in cliches.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMuch of the series lacks an ongoing narrative. This wouldn't necessarily be a problem, but that few of the episodes are truly amusing or interesting. To make matters worse, the drastic rearrangement of the chronology of events adapted from the manga to the anime eliminates significant plot arcs and, at least once, undermines character growth. For example, in the manga, the dodgeball arc was Negi's first real trial as a teacher, requiring him to demonstrate leadership and competence. In the anime, this is placed after the vampire arc, in which Negi had to muster his courage and work with some of his students to defeat a powerful opponent, thus reducing its importance to filler material.\\n\\n\r\nThe closing arc of the anime, an original plot line, was well enough done that it evoked genuine emotion, but unfortunately created a number of plot holes and required a deus ex machina to complete. \\n\\n\r\nThe one truly bright spot of the series was episode 19. Interestingly, the best episode of this harem comedy romp is an episode that features very little of the harem, and almost no comedy. Also, the episode is not adapted from a corresponding manga chapter, demonstrating that the writers were capable of creativity, and the series could have benefited greatly had they attempted to use it more often (like in parts of the last four episodes). The story revolves around Sayo, the ghost girl that nobody notices, and how the class reporter looks into the circumstances of her death. The tale is tender and tearful, and it manages this by following only two characters and resisting the urge to cheapen the plot with the silly games of the rest.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNegima has its shining moments, but they are few and far between. If you're looking for an accurate adaptation of the manga, you'll be sorely disappointed. If you're looking for a harem comedy, there are better out there.",

            "content": "I'll start off by saying the original manga is one of my current favorites and I went into this one with high expectations for the first anime adaptation, so this review is in the perpective of person who is already a fan of the series.\r\nSTORY: If you know plot of the beginning-\r\n*10 year old child prodigy magician Negi Springfield becomes a teacher for an all girls school of a class of about 30 girls with each one having their own unique and some what quirky traits and has to keep the fact about him being a magician a secret while the genre slowly evolves intoan actual shounen story while retaining it's other genres*\\n\\n\r\n-then I guess this adaptation does \"follow\" the source material, but only just a very limited amount of the original's story. \\n\\n\r\nThe majority of the episodes tend to mostly spend time trying to introduce each girl by doing seemingly non cannon wacky episodes with Negi and several other characters (And his perverted mascot pet, Chamo) pretending to be the main characters with no actual plot going on (Yeah it's episodic as hell).\\n\r\nIn fact, all it really just felt like they did was simply pick random chapters from the manga, stuff them with filler, and called it a day, but it's not necessarily a bad thing, the episode's can be little enjoyable as light harem entertainment, and the whole filler-ed up episodes is pretty normal since the majority of long running manga series tend to get the filler treatment all the time (Naruto, Bleach, One Piece, etc). \\n\r\nHowever, I would go as far as to say these episodes are very pointless, besides the few episode arcs, these episodes have almost nothing to actually do with any sort of story build up, but even with those arcs, the adaption still manages to screw it all up.\\n\r\nEspecially for one arc in particular towards the end, which was done in about roughly 2 to 3 episodes, literally butchering the story at that point with this anime skipping events, rushing through important story elements, and even cuts one of the characters out completly, which stops any source for certain future events from the source material (Although the anime is only 26 episodes).\\n\\n\r\nSo what does an anime company normally do when they seriously tamper with important elements to the original story? They pull the old anime only ending routine.\\n\r\nThe plot of the final episodes is about (the main female character) Asuna Kagurasaki, being killed off out of no where and Negi has to try to bring her back to life by stopping an event in Asuna's past that would cause her random death in the future by traveling back in time. with his whole class coming along for the ride (For a surprising lack of any kind of fun or zanyness from the early episodes had). \\n\r\nThe end result has Negi's entire class of girls gaining magical powers to fight an army of demons led by, what the plot strongly suggests, the devil himself, with the fights ending up being very silly and comical.\\n\r\nPretty much ends it out of no where with the mood going from happy and wacky school days to gloomy plot shredding, mood killing, and even a little depressing.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION: Very poor, the animators even had to redraw some of the frames (One of the characters head disappears for a couple of frames and apparently also had six fingers). And I can't imagine this anime looking worse than it does.\\n\r\nThough it kinda recaptures the look of the early manga art style with the character designs, it's shoddy and pathetic overall.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: I watched the dubbed version by Funimation and I have to say; this is honestly one the better dubs I've heard from them. \\n\r\nLuci Christian is well suited for her role as Asuna, and I enjoyed Chris Carson as the perverted mascot, Chamo. However, Greg Ayres who played the lead, Negi, sound like he had cancer or something. While the rest of the cast range from great to good enough.\\n\r\nHappy Material, the opening theme song which gets a remix mutiple times throughout the anime, is an okay song but not really something thats in my taste and I would rather skip (Especially because pf how repetitive it is).\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: \\n\r\nThe Good:\\n\r\n+ Light and fun\\n\r\n+ Good english dub\\n\\n\r\nThe Bad:\\n\r\n- Wastes a lot of time with filler\\n\r\n- Several story arcs are poorly done with little source material covered\\n\r\n- Crap-tastic animation\\n\r\n- Repetitive theme music\\n\r\n- The overall mood of the anime derails at the end\\n\\n\r\nFINAL WORD: I for one was very disappointed with the end result, but at the very least I enjoyed some of events from the manga that were (poorly) animated, so in the end it's not an absolute let down (Though, I feel like I'm being lenient), but it should have been done much better in my opinion.",

            "content": "The first thing I'm going to say is that I am a fan of Akamatsu-sensei's work and may be a bit biased. Now, the next thing I am going to say is that Xebec did not do \"Negima\" the justice it deserves. Why? There are several reasons.\r\n  For starters, the character designs throw you off right at the get go. Any Akamatsu character, more specifically females, have a sensual feel to them. Xebec's designs lacked that. The cheacters looks stiff and unnatural.\r\n  This leads me to my second point, there was no fan service. An story from Ken Akamatsu without fanservice is like a cold bowl of ramen, it's just damn disappointing. What's worse is they include Negi's sneezes that reveal Asuna's panties but leave out said panties. When I first saw this I thought it was edited and actually e-mailed Funi to learn it was uncut.\\n\r\n  The Japanese dub was very well done. All the girls sounded very natural and like what i imagine a class of Japanese jr high students would sound like. The English dub however, I cannot say the same. No usually I hold Greg Ayres in good standing i believe he did poorly with Negi. He spoke so quietly taht at points i couldn't understand him and the accent sounded ridiculously fake. I couldn't get enough of the opening song though, however I have a bias toward that type of music.\\n\r\n  So you may ask yourself why i gave the series an '8' if I had so many quarrels with it. Well, the truth is it was still the story and characters that I love. Also, the ending was done very well, even if the rest of the story wasn't, and proobablly made the overall difference of a '7' and an '8'. The last five or six episodes are a very intense watch.\\n\r\n  Overall though it's not hard to see why SHAFT was able to remake the series. I recently saw the trailer for the second version and actually watched two of the OVA's that go along with it. It looks like an improvement so I'm very anxious to see how it turns out. And if nothing else has changed, ladies and gentlemen WE HAVE FAN SERVICE. I give you...Asuna's panties!",

            "content": "I'm a really big fan of Negima. The manga, that is. SHAFT also made a borderline gag series (Negima!?) that somehow worked really well. However the first anime, made by XEBEC, is, by far, the worst version of Akamatsu's weird magic harem fighting manga. Yes, even worse than Neo.\r\nAs for the story, you all know the drill. 10 year old mage becomes a teacher at an all-girls junior high. Hilarity ensues. Now, adapting an ongoing manga into 26 episodes is, well, impossible, (which is why I applaud SHAFT for coming up with their own plot in their version) so a premature, anime-only ending was inevitable.I accept this.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the ending arc here is complete nonsense, and has some of the most ridiculous mood whiplash of all time, complete with a handy Deus Ex Machina to save the day. Joy. \\n\\n\r\nNow, if there's any aspect in which Negima! absolutely fails, it's animation, which doesn't bode well, to say the least. Off model shots are common, and the character designs look ugly, blocky, and very much unlike Akamatsu's designs. The last few episodes look better, though, with better looking characters and more fluid, less jerky animation. Not to mention the fact that the animation lacks any sort of detail, which the manga and Negima!? were overflowing with.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the opening animation, with all its fantastic music, is one of the most hideous displays of gratuitous, er, \"fanservice\" I have ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nNow, if there's any aspect in which Negima! actually succeeds in, it's sound. I've never seen the dub, so I can't judge that, but the voice acting is absolutely top-notch. The background music, while not quite at the level of Negima!?, is at least memorable.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the real success is Happy Material, the opening song. Really, the opening is the only reason I'm not pretending this anime doesn't exist. It's iPod worthy. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter development is more akin to character derailment, as the rather huge cast is nothing but mere shadows of their former selves. Really boring, really obnoxious shadows. I mean, Negima!? successfully quirked them up to the maximum without making them annoying, or derailing them.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking to get into Negima, skip this. Just skip this. Read the manga, watch Negima!?, and check out the OVAs. Hell, even Negima Neo is at least worth a read.\\n\\n\r\nWhen your series is worse than Negima Neo, there's a problem.\\n\\n\r\nA big problem.",

            "content": "Warning! This review contains spoilers, if you are someone who has not yet seen this anime but plan too, do not read any further than this. \r\nWhat can I say, this is about a 10 year old wizard prodogy from Wales, who ends up getting chosen to finnish the rest of his wizarding training in Japan as an English teacher for an all girls acadamy.... Adventure Ho! All the possible hijinks ang hillarious sexual tension take action in this very enjoyable anime. It follows a story that sticks some what close to the manga but still has quite a few differences. It also had tocreate its own ending because the manga was being produced more slowly than the anime. I had read the first volume of the manga series, discovering how much I enjoyed it, I decided to check out the anime adaptation. The first i noticed different was the begining, instead of starting with the main character, Negi Springfield, getting his assignment to teach at an all girls academy in Japan, it start of with the female protagonist, Asuna Kagurazaka, trying to cast a spell to make a teacher she has a crush on teach her class again. sooo the anime sorta vaguely makes it about her instead of Negi. Next thing I noticed was the animation, It was slightly lower grade than the manga and just slightly a step up from anverage flash video on newgrounds.com. For example most of the hair color for the characters were nothing like that of the manga and there was a slight lack of detail.\\n\\n\r\nAfter about 4 minutes of anticipation, I finally get to hear the voice of Negi. It isn't quite what you'd expect it to be, its not that bad it just catches you by surprise then after a while you kinda get use to it. (by th way, his name is not pronounced Neji). If you are able to get past the wierdness of the relation with Negi and his 14 year old female students and more into the story its very fun to watch, but if you also like the wierdness then cool. \\n\\n\r\nThere is a some what funny gag that goes on in the show, whenever Negi sneezes it creates a strong and powerful gust of wind, and most of the time Asuna is in front of him when this happens and practically all of her clothes get blown off, this causes uneeded embarasment for Asuna, thus causing a constant quaral between these two characters. Over the course of the series these characters are able to form a special bond between eachother, as well as a first kiss, but the kiss was a crucial event that needed to happen otherwise Negi would've died at the hands of a vampire named Evangalene A.K. McDowell. It turns out that in order for negi to have a gaurdian to help him in a time of need it needs to made official by a kiss. Negi ends up making this deal with all of his students. I dont know whats wierder, that fact that he is there teacher, or the fact the he is 4 to 6 years younger than they are. \\n\\n\r\nAny way, for my review I definitely recomend this anime. The last few episodes are really sad, but at the very last episode has a very touching conclusion that leaves you satisfied. However, there are some slight unanswered question that are left in the the air but thank god we have the upcoming ova's to tie those up. I myself am very satisfied with this anime, it was funny, akward, touching and enjoyable. My only suggestion is that you first read the first 3 volumes of the manga then watch the entire anime. When your done with that continue reading the manga for a much better story arc.",

The first thing you'll need to understand is that this isn't some fast-paced science fiction. The shows really takes it time to show us the aspect of each character's life, and in the end, making me care more about them as time passes. The show has 31 characters (I'm not even counting the staffs in the school). This could be a huge turn off to some people. It certainly made me feel a bit hesitant when going in. However, theshow does a descent job in introducing the huge cast. But, honesty, I felt like I cared for only 6 characters, which is not necessary a bad thing, since the show mostly focus on them anyway. Nevertheless, sometimes the show seems to be trying too hard, dragging the main characters along side with the minor characters so that the viewers won't forget about them. This happens a lot with Asuna. I the show can certainly sometimes get boring (especially the 4-mid-episodes of the show), but it was not too mundane to put me off. Sometimes I found my self wondering, \"why the fuck are they dicking around instead of doing some shit relating to magic.\" But towards the last half of the series, I felt that this is a wonderful story about how a group of students had gone through trails and tribulation and became friends. In the end, I could say that I enjoyed the show. This show is for those of you who like a moderately paced slice of life show, with some element of fantasy sprinkled into it.",

The beginning of the show has a girl in a fish suit dancing, floods of school girls running towards their school in an empty city, and a bear panty flip skirt scene, and all this sets the mood for most of the show. I still continued on mostly for the fact the this series is having a sequel (in some sense) coming out soon, and i just had to see what it was all about. I just wanted to know what would allowfor this show to have a spinoff, 3 separate ovas, and a sequel 13 years later.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime follows Negi, a 9 year old kid who is a mage and is also the newest teacher in an all girls school, i think. Because you see, the setting takes place in this school/city that has different areas for different schools, and is pretty much why there was a lot of girls running in the beginning since that is there section of the town. Why is this such a thing? I really don't know, and they really don't delve into it. Anyway Negi is assigned to a all girl middle school for his mage training although i don't see how any of this connects together other than that the principle, and some of the staff are mages or at least connected to the magical world. It's never delved into as well. It's mostly just a setup for the school harem that will take place with a teacher , but it's ok now since the the teacher is a kid. Well it's easy to say that all the girls take a liking to him due to how cute he is, and it could have been left just as girls liking a cute kid. However the show goes beyond that and has some of the girls having romantic feelings for him, and even setting out to get a kiss from him. \\n\r\nNothing really interesting happens in the show with most episodes focusing on a character. While there are \u201cstory arcs\u201d in the show it still for the most part focusing on a character or two. There is action and tension in the show, but it  falls flat most of the time because it tries to set out to be something else but it still maintains the same tone. There\u2019s also no buildup to anything which allow things to happen without any proper reasoning. It does later in the story shift tone pretty well, but when it gets there, it gets absurdly over dramatic until finally going back to status quo. For much of a story it was at least easily digestible, but mostly for the part that there wasn\u2019t a lot of meat in it\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n31! That\u2019s how many students are in the class and given that this is only 26 episodes long be unamazed that many of them are glossed over. Not only them but all the other characters as well from the staffs of the school, and even the antagonists. All these girls are defined mostly by a quirk or hobby that they have, and that\u2019s about it. However some of the girls do get an episode of their own, and they sure do leave an impression on the viewers, but once it\u2019s done they usually go back into the background. There are really three characters that have more relevance in the show than anyone else. First is negi the young welsh mage who is sent to teach at  school for no apparent reason other than just because. Negi was never supposed to reveal that he was a mage or else he would be kicked out of the school, but that\u2019s kicked to the wayside when more than \u2156 figures him out but no consequences ever happen to him.  Next is Asuna who is more of the main girl since the show really does focus on her a lot more than anyone else. She basically a tsundere who has a crush on one of the teachers, and was one of the first to figure out negi was a mage because of her special ability that\u2019s never really explained. Finally is Nodoka who is a shy girl who gets more screen time than for her own good with her defining characteristic is liking negi and her character development being have the courage to confess.\\n\\n\r\nThe art looks pretty basic. The character designs are basic and sometimes some characters look like each other, the background designs are basic, and the color palette doesn\u2019t look any special. The animation is also just as basic but it really shows how substandard it is when anything worth of action occurs, and it just feels so underwhelming. Everything is still easy to put up with, but nothing really stands out. The soundtrack to the anime is decent for the most part although there are probably only two tracks that really stand out, and even they are forgettable. Everything else is standard fare when it comes to a comedic school story. The voice acting is ok as well, it\u2019s rather diverse with each character sounding unique but not much else.\\n\\n\r\nThis show was dumb which was pretty much what i expected from it. I had a decent time, and there was nothing really wrong with how the show played out even though it was quite dumb. However it was the last few episodes that made the show less enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it is a really forgettable show, and nothing really stand out that makes this anime any special.\\n",

            "content": "I wasn't sure what to expect coming into this anime, described as being about a 10-year-od teaching a class of middle school girls, tagged as harem and ecchi. On the whole, I found it to be easy to watch and enjoy without it getting too heavy with the drama. The story was well done and at times delightful.\r\nI especially loved the characters and how they developed over the course of the show. Negi is portrayed well in terms of the balance between having to be the teacher and authority figure in the classroom, and being a boy younger than the class he teaches. Asuna isflawed yet likeable as the lead female character, and Chomo is amusing as the comic relief ermine. Something that especially impressed me is that all 31 of the girls in Negi's class had faces and names, and most of them had a significant supporting role in at least one or two episodes of the series. By contrast, most series in a setting like this would focus on no more than about 8 or so characters while the rest become nameless background characters, whereas this one does a surprisingly good job of making the whole class look real without distracting too much from the primary characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is kind of odd-sounding at times, yet oddly fitting. The art generally very good, though not particularly exemplary or stylistically notable.\\n\\n\r\nLet me also address that ecchi tag. There are a few instances of characters in their undergarments, or even portraying them nude in such places as public baths, but they generally have a sort of youthful innocence about them. There is little if any of the sexual innuendo or eroticism commonly seen in ecchi portraying characters a few years older. What relationships develop between characters are reasonably in keeping with the ages of the characters - middle school crushes and such.\\n\\n\r\nThe final story arc has some heavier drama in it than the rest of the series up to that point, and I felt uncertain going into the last couple of episodes. Let it suffice to say that the final episode has a couple of surprises that some might say are over the top but I thought they worked well and were a pleasant turn of events to see. It ended well and left me liking it more than I expected to, or thought I would even a few episodes in.",

It entertains the viewer enough as to keep them watching.\r\nIt includes comedy, drama, fantasy, and a bit of action. The comedy is just fine, like any other average comedy serie; drama is a bit tacky since it relies on the average romantic plot where two characters meet but do not accept their feelings until the very end of the serie; fantasy doesn't even needs to be explained i guess (Negi, the main character, is a wizard; I think that's enough explanation); and the action part is just above the borderline of being acceptable.\r\nTheshow is missing a definite storyline throughout the whole series, it seems just like a whole bunch of different things put together in each episode (except, maybe, in the last few episodes). Art is nothing out of this world, missing out on lots of detailing. The intro song is kinda fun, it's very lively; it suits the series pretty well. The characters are all very different and fun, each one of them being a different stereotype, basically.\\n\\n\r\nYou can spend your time watching this series, you'll have fun with it. ^^",

            "content": "Mahou Sensei Negima is rather odd. It is kind of like if you take a harem, made the girl population about thirty times the boy population, and then made the boy, like, four years younger than the girls. Actually, that pretty much sums up this series. Ken Akamatsu, who created the show's manga, is also rather well known for his previous series, Love Hina. In my opinion, this show far surpasses Love Hina, and here's why.\r\nStory 8/10\r\nThe story of Negima starts off like your typical harem, but gradually evolves to become so much more. By the end of it, the girls aren't entirely the mainfocus, as the wizardry and magic also plays a strong role. It becomes somewhat of an unpredictable roller coaster of fun, from computer battles to a haunted mansion/pillow fight to an adventure into the depths of a library. Very entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art for Negima looks good for 2006, but now.... Not so much. This looks aged, and the style is very simplistic. Still I have to give it props for looking good for 2006... When it isn't being compared to Haruhi or Black Lagoon.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is good, but not amazing. It has tracks that provide good atmosphere, but nothing more. What I do have to give props for, however, is the dub. The dub was done by Funimation, and quite frankly, it sounds amazing. Memorable performances include Luci Christian, Laura Bailey, and Caitlin Glass. Trust me, dub is the way to go for this one.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is Negima's problem with having such a large female cast: not everyone gets an episode or even 5 minutes. But when they do, it's good. Stand-out characters include Asuna, our tsundere-baka, Evangeline, our Loli, Yue, our sarcastic bookworm, Chisame, our tsundere computer chick, and Kazumi, our hyper photographer. The rest are just okay.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\\n\r\nNegima is one of those series that you know isn't good, but is entertaining to watch. It has some solid humor, a cool plot, and some interesting characters. It's more popcorn material than anything, yet remains entertaining. I recommend watching it with friends.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\\n\r\nIt has it's flaws, but is still solid enough to watch. Stream at your leisure!",

I noticed that this one has alot more emphasis on the harem aspect of the sereis alot ore thsn the magic or story. There is a story, just not one important to remember. I've watched the entirety of the Remake, and i honestly felt that the remake turned the Harem aspect to its side. In this one, Negi is having to worry about all of the girls flling in love with him. As for the remake, the Harem part is due tohim having to have multipe partners. I noticed that in the original, one of the characters is a ghost, and (if i am not mistaken, since i haven't seen through to the end yet) basically is there as wasted space. In the Remake, she has more of an importance.\\n\r\nThe intro to this one has basically a bunch of the girls in this series hitting a beach ball, with the picture changing to different sets of 3 girls. As for the other intro, you would just have to look it up. (1000% Sparkles -English Version recommend unless you don't  care about if it is dub or sub, then it is just fine as it is)\\n\r\nTo finish off this review, if i were to recommend you watch this, DO NOT watch the Remake BEFORE you watch this one! This will save you the trouble of being disappointed(wish i knew beforehand).",

Rather than following the typical \"take a guy and throw him in a house full of girls\" ala Shuffle or Sister Princess, Negima takes a guy and throws him in a school filled with girls. Negi, the main character, is a 10 year old genius who has graduated college at the age of 10 and is teaching at an all girls middle school. He also happens to be a young British wizard, which helps pull in the Harry-Potter-watching demographic I suppose.\r\nMany of the episodes unfold like a typical date-sim turned into an anime series, where there will be a concentration onone of the girls in the class. The whole series remains pretty fluffy and lighthearted until episode 21 or so, and then becomes a bit serious so there can be some form of conflict and climax to end the series. I could pretty easily watch 100s of Negima episodes, as it's a good way to wind down at the end of the day, but those of you looking for more serious fare or something less cookie-cutter should look elsewhere. Animation is very typical, nothing poor nor exceptional.",

It's far too cutesy, it doesn't have any of the more serious elements of the original manga and they even portray the characters differently. I think they should have relabeled the anime as a spin off rather than the anime interpretation of the manga.\nThat aside (I'm going to pretend that i haven't read most of the manga.\nIt's a great anime, very cutesy,a little, slightly disturbing romance, some good fight scenes and some moments that will make you cry. If it wasn't negima, I probably would have watched anyway, as it does have a good storyline and makes quite a change to the usual high school romance and supernatural scene.\\n\\n\nTaking the manga into consideration, I'd give it a 4/10, but if you haven't read the manga, I'd say 9/10 and definitely worth watching. I have based my scoring on not taking the manga into consideration as this is a review of the ANIME in the end.",

            "content": "Before I start this review, take into consideration that when I watched this, I did not read a single chapter of the manga yet. This was also the first anime I was hooked on.   \r\nDuring my last vacation to America, I got bored. So bored that I resorted to waching anime in desperation. When I first heard about Mahou Sensei Negima, I decided to give it a shot and watch it. I was surprised at what I had stumbled upon. \r\nThe story was very original. I'd never expect a 10 year old teacher who teaches in an all girl's school. To make thingsmore interesting, he's also a magician. To make things spicier, the class he teaches is full of strange and interesting people such as a vampire, a person from the future, a robot etc. The combination of all these weird, crazy and wacky ideas makes the series really interesting to watch.\\n\\n\r\nNow the animation is the series' weakest point. Everything looks like it was colored with watercolor. Everything looked kinda pale and lightish is hue. Also, the characters could have been drawn a lot better.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is where the series really shines. The opening and ending themes are really cute and are very addicting to listen to. 4 months after watching Mahou Sensei Negima, I'm still not bored of the songs. \\n\\n\r\nThe series also has the best bgms I have ever heard. They are composed so well that they could rival Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter development was good. The relationship Negi had with some of his students was shown pretty well. My only problem was some of the students in Negi's class were given so little airtime that I couldn't remember who they were much less thier names. Well with a class of 31, it's obvious this problem could not be avoided. \\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I enjoyed Mahou Sensei Negima. It was fun and entertaining to watch and it took away most of my boredom. It even made me shed a tear or two. But after reading part of the manga, I can say that the manga totally owns the series XD.",

However this Shounen anime seems to be aimed more at the female demographic, leaving most guys cringing at all the cuteness. ^_^\r\nNegima! is a Magical, Supernatural, Harem, Comedy about 10 year old boy Negi, who has become a teacher at an all girls school. There's one other shocking piece of info about him and that is, he's a Mage (Magician).\r\nWell that's the basic idea of this simple show and what helps it stand out is the shear number of girls (31 in fact), so learning their names are impossible. Even thoughthis harem, comedy has the advantage of being a magical one it seems to start of fairly normally, which can be quite dull for anime fans that are used to this genre. The story manages to become good and fun to watch at times, but with its cheesy outcomes it may leave little to be desired. With a pretty basic story, the romance is what supposed to help keep it going however he male protagonist is only 10 and with 14-15 year old girls it can be really hard to take it seriously. So throughout the show it has to rely on the slapstick comedy and fan service, which can be pretty weak at times.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation quality is as basic as it can get, with not an ounce of detail put into it at all. Because this is a comedy it could be forgiven however there actually is a fair bit of action in this series, which is quite disappointing to watch. The music is there but it does absolutely nothing to help and is just there to fill in the silence.\\n\\n\r\nTo summarize Negima! It had the potential of being one of the greatest harems, having every single type of anime girl crammed in, but the fact that Negi is a 10 year old teacher is just far to unbelievable. At least the story improves in the 2nd half where some of the girls are individually developed however it had to rely on a shocking tear-jerking moment in the end. The majority of the negative issues were addressed in the 2nd series (Negima!?) but the fact still remains that this is an overrated series that doesn't really deserve the recognition it has.\\n\r\n^_^",

            "content": "Negima, also known as Mahou Sensei Negima, Negima Magister Magi Negi and numerous other titles, is based on a long-running manga by Ken Akamatsu, best known for the archetype-setting harem series Love Hina. Love Hina was adapted by Xebec, and subjected to a not-particularly-great adaptation. Negima is almost the same in that respect, except that rather than a not-particularly-great adaptation, here we are presented with an appalling one. \r\nFor starters, this series came out several years sooner than it should have done. The manga is, to this day, still running, and promises to be around 40-50 volumes in length by its completion. This, however, wasmade when they were still only few volumes in. When Akamatsu was going to make this series, he wanted to make a Shonen manga, but was forced to make a harem manga in an attempt to repeat the success of Love Hina. As a result, he kicked off with a blatant harem setup, and gradually shifted away to becoming a Shonen series instead. In the process, it eventually became something of a Shonen manga for Harem fans.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, while battle Shonen series are increasingly becoming a patch on the anime industry, with repetitive fights, contrived plots, one-dimensional characters, and optimal capability to be completely recycled by another series with a quick, unconvincing makeover, the Negima manga is absolutely none of those. Negima knows what it is, and gleefully runs through all the battle shonen tropes and harem tropes in hilarious tongue-in-cheek fashion. But even while happily resigning itself to being a generic shonen series, it manages to be utterly exemplary as one, building three-dimensional characters, rich fantasy worlds, plots that skilfully manage god knows how many characters and still manage to make most of them interesting an memorable, fights that are well-constructed and compelling, and humour that is outright hilarious. In effect, Negima is something that every shonen series should strive to be.\\n\\n\r\nThat is, however, something this series decides to completely ignore. It kicks off mostly faithful to the first part of the series, but promptly decides to deviate whenever any of the story arcs pop up. Yes, rather than actually following the plot of Negima, regarding Negi's exploits to find his long-lost father, they just decide to do... well, pretty much nothing. All the series ever focuses on are the protagonist Negi Springfield's day-to-day activities as the teacher of an all-girl high school. In a nutshell, what this is series has done is taken every piece of filler from the manga and put it together into a series. The only time they really touch on any of the manga's story arcs is the Kyoto arc, which took about 3 volumes of the manga to cover. They then proceed to dedicate about 2 episodes on this, cutting out pretty much everything of importance, and cutting a major character (Kotaro) out of the story altogether. The end result is a rushed and butchered version of what was previously a good story arc.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, Negima is a character-driven series, which it would really have to be considering that it starts off with around 35 characters, and in the current arc of the manga it must be nearing 100. Problem is that the series stops at around 45, and only remembers to make a handful or two remotely interesting. The only ones that are really worth mentioning are as follows: Negi, our protagonist, a ten year old Welsh magician. As part of their training, young wizards are sent off to work to test their abilities, with Negi's test being to teach a school of Japanese students who are older than he is. He has a fantastic backstory that spans childhood horrors, parental abandonment, and a crippling need to become a great wizard for reason I won't dare spoil. This adaptation covers approximately none of it.\\n\\n\r\nWe also see his first of many sidekicks, Asuna Kagurazaka, whose backstory digs so far back that I can't even say a word of it without spoiling anybody. But naturally, not a single bit of it was adapted, so we are left with a one-dimensional character who is bossy and annoying. It's worth noting that even in the manga she's not particularly likeable. We also have Evangeline A.K. McDowell, a vampire who was imprisoned in the school by Negi's father and needs Negi's blood to escape, Nodoka Miyazaki, the clumsy, hyper-moe bookworm girl and primary love interest, and Yue Ayase, friend of Nodoka and general deadpan snarker. Other than that, most of the remaining 40-something cast members aren't used much. Some of them get their episodes in the spotlight, but none of them ever really shine as a result. Several cast members get as many as one or two lines in the entire series. Some others are also quite out of character, in particular Sayo Aisaka, the ghost.\\n\\n\r\nOn the technical side of things, Negima is as poor as it is anywhere else. The animation is awful, littered with animation mistakes absolutely everywhere, and the colouring is horribly bland and undersaturated. The music is all either annoying J-pop or completely forgettable. Negima was a series I watched before I was in the habit of watching subbed series, so I regretfully sat through the horrible dubbing. Don't get me wrong, I actually like dubs, but this is a really bad one. Greg Ayres as Negi is the highlight of how bad it gets. Effectively, Ayres is the Michael Cera of English dubbed anime. He has a distinctive, whiny voice, that can either be amusing, loveable and endearing, or horribly annoying. And the absolute pinnacle of just how annoying Greg Ayres can be when casted poorly is Negi Springfield. His voice is, in addition to its usual nasally whine, made considerable higher and given something of a British accent. To simulate the experience of hearing this, find your nearest chalkboard and scrape your nails down it. Despite the large cast, there are very few decent performances here (Brina Palencia as Yue Ayase and Laura Bailey as Evangeline A.K. McDowell are the only good ones in here), as well as several other irritating ones such as Leah Clark (Nodoka) and Monica Rial (Konoka) both putting in extremely shrill voices, with the remainder of the cast simply being either poor or unremarkable.\\n\\n\r\nAt this point I'm sure that several readers are annoyed at how much I've prattled on about the differences in the adaptation, but the thing is that when you take that away there is very little to talk about. When depleted of all the manga's positives, what we are left with is a series that is honestly lifeless. The comedy is mostly absent, and when it does it falls flat. None of the characters are enjoyable in the least. The plot is almost nonexistent. This series doesn't even have any fanservice to carry it for the lowest common denominator (ecchi fans).\\n\\n\r\nBeing an ongoing series, Negima of course had an anime-exclusive ending. While it was very contrived and the drama was laid on awfully thick, the plot itself honestly wasn't that bad and at least saves this anime from being absolutely, 100% terrible, alongside a very small handful of funny moments.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, Negima has since left the hands of Xebec, and moves into those of Shaft. Shaft have gone on to make a TV series that is essentially Negima in name only, although it is still a damn sight better than this, two random filler OVAs, and most likely due to complaints, two series of OVAs covering later arcs in the manga, which are easily the best animated chunks of Negima. Sadly, this pretty much rules out any kind of full series adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nThanks,  Xebec. You ruined it.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Words: For the love of god, buy the manga first.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation/Graphics: 1/10\\n\r\nStory/Plot: 2/10\\n\r\nCharacters; 3/10\\n\r\nMusic/Background: 4/10\\n\r\nEnglish Dub: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nFor Fans Of: Love Hina, Harry Potter.",

            "content": "As I started watching this, I was frankly afraid of falling into a pit of lollicon Ecchi with tons of pre teen boobs fallin all over the screen, but I was gladly surprised with a heartwarming comedy about friendship and loyalty.\r\nStory: 8.\r\nI don't give it a higher grade ONLY because you can tell it's unfinished. I mean, it all wounds up in the last episode, but you can tell the story doesn't stop there(that actually led me to the manga , - that continued for several more years after the anime ended - which I started reading after the finale).\r\nSo, I think the concept isactually quite good, Negi Springfield is a Wizard apprentice who has to complete a mission in order to become a minister magi, and that mission is to be the teacher for a middle school class at an all girls boarding school. It can be kinda difficult if we take in account that he's a 10 years old boy. during his teaching period we get to follow some of his adventures with the all magic world getting entangled with his school teaching world, while getting to know his students bit by bit.\\n\r\nThe story is kinda slow developing at first, and it's a bit rushed in the last 4/5 episodes, yet it's still quite enjoyable.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nI would give it a 6,5 but well, there goes a 7.\\n\r\nAkamatsu's art is really pretty and clean and detailed, and somehow i think the animation was a little below that if you see the original art and compare it with the one in this series. Is not bad, it could just be a little better I think.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8 \\n\r\nThe staff that adapted the whole manga into an anime had a though job with character development, if you think about it.\\n\r\nIt consists in Negi Kun, 31 students plus the school staff, and they all appeared frequently in each episode. In only 26 episodes you couldn't possibly ask fo lots of character development with so many characters, still you got to know most f them at a superficial level, and in the overall they're all really likeable and spiffy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nOkay, i really liked the all package. It was a really enjoyable story, about young love, crushes, friendship, growth, and a fairly happy ending, and I gotta say, I'm really a sucker for happy endings.",

            "content": "Watch episode 19, then pretend the rest of the series doesn't exist. Rarely does the series succeed in rising above the mark of generic in any aspect, more often taking advantage of being an adaptation of a work by Ken Akamatsu and assuming fans will mindlessly race to hand over money (which they did).\r\nMany fans laud the anime for originality because it features a harem surrounding a preteen teacher who happens to be a wizard. However, the magical aspect is used only infrequently, as are the child-teacher jokes. The preteen harem lead aspect is used fairly often, but is of limited improvement over the typicalspineless loser harem lead.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNegima's most obvious problem is the visual. The art is unpleasing, and the animation is lackluster. For all the vibrant colors, the characters look flat and lack dynamic. The action scenes are done so lazily, such as Negi's battle with Eva in episode 8, that they are almost painful to watch. The quality was so bad that Xebec had to change the entire animation team about halfway through the series and reanimated the earlier episodes for DVD release. While this was an improvement, it is akin to stating that dog food tastes better than chalk; much of the series only matches the quality of shows ten years older. Also, while generally a rainbow of hair colors is common to distinguish characters who look similar among a large cast, how many other series make fun of that point in the actual dub.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe dub cast was not really a strong point of the show either. While there weren't any bad performances, unless you couldn't stand Greg Ayres attempt to speak in a pitch several octaves above normal to play Negi, the number of characters required several actresses to play multiple roles. This in itself is not exactly a problem, except that in many cases the drastic efforts they made to sound distinctly different did not match the character. The Japanese audio track would be preferable, except that the English script took liberties with the dialogue that made the series if not interesting, more tolerable. \\n\\n\r\nThe music - background, OP, ED, all of it - was like audio cotton candy: light, fluffy, and sugary. A perfect, borderline obnoxious, match for the visual pallet of the series. \\n\\n\\n\r\nI've mentioned before that the cast of the show is rather large, and that is another of its failings. It is unreasonable to assume that over 30 characters could be properly fleshed out and given interesting backgrounds, but the anime was unwilling to concede screen time from the ensemble to allow individual characters to be given their 15 minutes of fame. Ayaka's story, for instance, had potential to be touching and personal, but the animators felt compelled to include the generic madcap hijinx of the rest of class 3-A. Such an inclusion did nothing to expand the personalities of any other characters, as the only character-specific goofy antics were based around the one-dimensional stereotypes the girls were slotted into. Seeing a robot go on an accidental rampage because someone pushed the wrong button is barely amusing the first time it happens, but in Negima it serves to undermine the nature of the character because lazy writers can only think in cliches.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMuch of the series lacks an ongoing narrative. This wouldn't necessarily be a problem, but that few of the episodes are truly amusing or interesting. To make matters worse, the drastic rearrangement of the chronology of events adapted from the manga to the anime eliminates significant plot arcs and, at least once, undermines character growth. For example, in the manga, the dodgeball arc was Negi's first real trial as a teacher, requiring him to demonstrate leadership and competence. In the anime, this is placed after the vampire arc, in which Negi had to muster his courage and work with some of his students to defeat a powerful opponent, thus reducing its importance to filler material.\\n\\n\r\nThe closing arc of the anime, an original plot line, was well enough done that it evoked genuine emotion, but unfortunately created a number of plot holes and required a deus ex machina to complete. \\n\\n\r\nThe one truly bright spot of the series was episode 19. Interestingly, the best episode of this harem comedy romp is an episode that features very little of the harem, and almost no comedy. Also, the episode is not adapted from a corresponding manga chapter, demonstrating that the writers were capable of creativity, and the series could have benefited greatly had they attempted to use it more often (like in parts of the last four episodes). The story revolves around Sayo, the ghost girl that nobody notices, and how the class reporter looks into the circumstances of her death. The tale is tender and tearful, and it manages this by following only two characters and resisting the urge to cheapen the plot with the silly games of the rest.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNegima has its shining moments, but they are few and far between. If you're looking for an accurate adaptation of the manga, you'll be sorely disappointed. If you're looking for a harem comedy, there are better out there.",

            "content": "I'll start off by saying the original manga is one of my current favorites and I went into this one with high expectations for the first anime adaptation, so this review is in the perpective of person who is already a fan of the series.\r\nSTORY: If you know plot of the beginning-\r\n*10 year old child prodigy magician Negi Springfield becomes a teacher for an all girls school of a class of about 30 girls with each one having their own unique and some what quirky traits and has to keep the fact about him being a magician a secret while the genre slowly evolves intoan actual shounen story while retaining it's other genres*\\n\\n\r\n-then I guess this adaptation does \"follow\" the source material, but only just a very limited amount of the original's story. \\n\\n\r\nThe majority of the episodes tend to mostly spend time trying to introduce each girl by doing seemingly non cannon wacky episodes with Negi and several other characters (And his perverted mascot pet, Chamo) pretending to be the main characters with no actual plot going on (Yeah it's episodic as hell).\\n\r\nIn fact, all it really just felt like they did was simply pick random chapters from the manga, stuff them with filler, and called it a day, but it's not necessarily a bad thing, the episode's can be little enjoyable as light harem entertainment, and the whole filler-ed up episodes is pretty normal since the majority of long running manga series tend to get the filler treatment all the time (Naruto, Bleach, One Piece, etc). \\n\r\nHowever, I would go as far as to say these episodes are very pointless, besides the few episode arcs, these episodes have almost nothing to actually do with any sort of story build up, but even with those arcs, the adaption still manages to screw it all up.\\n\r\nEspecially for one arc in particular towards the end, which was done in about roughly 2 to 3 episodes, literally butchering the story at that point with this anime skipping events, rushing through important story elements, and even cuts one of the characters out completly, which stops any source for certain future events from the source material (Although the anime is only 26 episodes).\\n\\n\r\nSo what does an anime company normally do when they seriously tamper with important elements to the original story? They pull the old anime only ending routine.\\n\r\nThe plot of the final episodes is about (the main female character) Asuna Kagurasaki, being killed off out of no where and Negi has to try to bring her back to life by stopping an event in Asuna's past that would cause her random death in the future by traveling back in time. with his whole class coming along for the ride (For a surprising lack of any kind of fun or zanyness from the early episodes had). \\n\r\nThe end result has Negi's entire class of girls gaining magical powers to fight an army of demons led by, what the plot strongly suggests, the devil himself, with the fights ending up being very silly and comical.\\n\r\nPretty much ends it out of no where with the mood going from happy and wacky school days to gloomy plot shredding, mood killing, and even a little depressing.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION: Very poor, the animators even had to redraw some of the frames (One of the characters head disappears for a couple of frames and apparently also had six fingers). And I can't imagine this anime looking worse than it does.\\n\r\nThough it kinda recaptures the look of the early manga art style with the character designs, it's shoddy and pathetic overall.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: I watched the dubbed version by Funimation and I have to say; this is honestly one the better dubs I've heard from them. \\n\r\nLuci Christian is well suited for her role as Asuna, and I enjoyed Chris Carson as the perverted mascot, Chamo. However, Greg Ayres who played the lead, Negi, sound like he had cancer or something. While the rest of the cast range from great to good enough.\\n\r\nHappy Material, the opening theme song which gets a remix mutiple times throughout the anime, is an okay song but not really something thats in my taste and I would rather skip (Especially because pf how repetitive it is).\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: \\n\r\nThe Good:\\n\r\n+ Light and fun\\n\r\n+ Good english dub\\n\\n\r\nThe Bad:\\n\r\n- Wastes a lot of time with filler\\n\r\n- Several story arcs are poorly done with little source material covered\\n\r\n- Crap-tastic animation\\n\r\n- Repetitive theme music\\n\r\n- The overall mood of the anime derails at the end\\n\\n\r\nFINAL WORD: I for one was very disappointed with the end result, but at the very least I enjoyed some of events from the manga that were (poorly) animated, so in the end it's not an absolute let down (Though, I feel like I'm being lenient), but it should have been done much better in my opinion.",

            "content": "The first thing I'm going to say is that I am a fan of Akamatsu-sensei's work and may be a bit biased. Now, the next thing I am going to say is that Xebec did not do \"Negima\" the justice it deserves. Why? There are several reasons.\r\n  For starters, the character designs throw you off right at the get go. Any Akamatsu character, more specifically females, have a sensual feel to them. Xebec's designs lacked that. The cheacters looks stiff and unnatural.\r\n  This leads me to my second point, there was no fan service. An story from Ken Akamatsu without fanservice is like a cold bowl of ramen, it's just damn disappointing. What's worse is they include Negi's sneezes that reveal Asuna's panties but leave out said panties. When I first saw this I thought it was edited and actually e-mailed Funi to learn it was uncut.\\n\r\n  The Japanese dub was very well done. All the girls sounded very natural and like what i imagine a class of Japanese jr high students would sound like. The English dub however, I cannot say the same. No usually I hold Greg Ayres in good standing i believe he did poorly with Negi. He spoke so quietly taht at points i couldn't understand him and the accent sounded ridiculously fake. I couldn't get enough of the opening song though, however I have a bias toward that type of music.\\n\r\n  So you may ask yourself why i gave the series an '8' if I had so many quarrels with it. Well, the truth is it was still the story and characters that I love. Also, the ending was done very well, even if the rest of the story wasn't, and proobablly made the overall difference of a '7' and an '8'. The last five or six episodes are a very intense watch.\\n\r\n  Overall though it's not hard to see why SHAFT was able to remake the series. I recently saw the trailer for the second version and actually watched two of the OVA's that go along with it. It looks like an improvement so I'm very anxious to see how it turns out. And if nothing else has changed, ladies and gentlemen WE HAVE FAN SERVICE. I give you...Asuna's panties!",

            "content": "I'm a really big fan of Negima. The manga, that is. SHAFT also made a borderline gag series (Negima!?) that somehow worked really well. However the first anime, made by XEBEC, is, by far, the worst version of Akamatsu's weird magic harem fighting manga. Yes, even worse than Neo.\r\nAs for the story, you all know the drill. 10 year old mage becomes a teacher at an all-girls junior high. Hilarity ensues. Now, adapting an ongoing manga into 26 episodes is, well, impossible, (which is why I applaud SHAFT for coming up with their own plot in their version) so a premature, anime-only ending was inevitable.I accept this.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the ending arc here is complete nonsense, and has some of the most ridiculous mood whiplash of all time, complete with a handy Deus Ex Machina to save the day. Joy. \\n\\n\r\nNow, if there's any aspect in which Negima! absolutely fails, it's animation, which doesn't bode well, to say the least. Off model shots are common, and the character designs look ugly, blocky, and very much unlike Akamatsu's designs. The last few episodes look better, though, with better looking characters and more fluid, less jerky animation. Not to mention the fact that the animation lacks any sort of detail, which the manga and Negima!? were overflowing with.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the opening animation, with all its fantastic music, is one of the most hideous displays of gratuitous, er, \"fanservice\" I have ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nNow, if there's any aspect in which Negima! actually succeeds in, it's sound. I've never seen the dub, so I can't judge that, but the voice acting is absolutely top-notch. The background music, while not quite at the level of Negima!?, is at least memorable.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the real success is Happy Material, the opening song. Really, the opening is the only reason I'm not pretending this anime doesn't exist. It's iPod worthy. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter development is more akin to character derailment, as the rather huge cast is nothing but mere shadows of their former selves. Really boring, really obnoxious shadows. I mean, Negima!? successfully quirked them up to the maximum without making them annoying, or derailing them.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking to get into Negima, skip this. Just skip this. Read the manga, watch Negima!?, and check out the OVAs. Hell, even Negima Neo is at least worth a read.\\n\\n\r\nWhen your series is worse than Negima Neo, there's a problem.\\n\\n\r\nA big problem.",

            "content": "Warning! This review contains spoilers, if you are someone who has not yet seen this anime but plan too, do not read any further than this. \r\nWhat can I say, this is about a 10 year old wizard prodogy from Wales, who ends up getting chosen to finnish the rest of his wizarding training in Japan as an English teacher for an all girls acadamy.... Adventure Ho! All the possible hijinks ang hillarious sexual tension take action in this very enjoyable anime. It follows a story that sticks some what close to the manga but still has quite a few differences. It also had tocreate its own ending because the manga was being produced more slowly than the anime. I had read the first volume of the manga series, discovering how much I enjoyed it, I decided to check out the anime adaptation. The first i noticed different was the begining, instead of starting with the main character, Negi Springfield, getting his assignment to teach at an all girls academy in Japan, it start of with the female protagonist, Asuna Kagurazaka, trying to cast a spell to make a teacher she has a crush on teach her class again. sooo the anime sorta vaguely makes it about her instead of Negi. Next thing I noticed was the animation, It was slightly lower grade than the manga and just slightly a step up from anverage flash video on newgrounds.com. For example most of the hair color for the characters were nothing like that of the manga and there was a slight lack of detail.\\n\\n\r\nAfter about 4 minutes of anticipation, I finally get to hear the voice of Negi. It isn't quite what you'd expect it to be, its not that bad it just catches you by surprise then after a while you kinda get use to it. (by th way, his name is not pronounced Neji). If you are able to get past the wierdness of the relation with Negi and his 14 year old female students and more into the story its very fun to watch, but if you also like the wierdness then cool. \\n\\n\r\nThere is a some what funny gag that goes on in the show, whenever Negi sneezes it creates a strong and powerful gust of wind, and most of the time Asuna is in front of him when this happens and practically all of her clothes get blown off, this causes uneeded embarasment for Asuna, thus causing a constant quaral between these two characters. Over the course of the series these characters are able to form a special bond between eachother, as well as a first kiss, but the kiss was a crucial event that needed to happen otherwise Negi would've died at the hands of a vampire named Evangalene A.K. McDowell. It turns out that in order for negi to have a gaurdian to help him in a time of need it needs to made official by a kiss. Negi ends up making this deal with all of his students. I dont know whats wierder, that fact that he is there teacher, or the fact the he is 4 to 6 years younger than they are. \\n\\n\r\nAny way, for my review I definitely recomend this anime. The last few episodes are really sad, but at the very last episode has a very touching conclusion that leaves you satisfied. However, there are some slight unanswered question that are left in the the air but thank god we have the upcoming ova's to tie those up. I myself am very satisfied with this anime, it was funny, akward, touching and enjoyable. My only suggestion is that you first read the first 3 volumes of the manga then watch the entire anime. When your done with that continue reading the manga for a much better story arc.",

The first thing you'll need to understand is that this isn't some fast-paced science fiction. The shows really takes it time to show us the aspect of each character's life, and in the end, making me care more about them as time passes. The show has 31 characters (I'm not even counting the staffs in the school). This could be a huge turn off to some people. It certainly made me feel a bit hesitant when going in. However, theshow does a descent job in introducing the huge cast. But, honesty, I felt like I cared for only 6 characters, which is not necessary a bad thing, since the show mostly focus on them anyway. Nevertheless, sometimes the show seems to be trying too hard, dragging the main characters along side with the minor characters so that the viewers won't forget about them. This happens a lot with Asuna. I the show can certainly sometimes get boring (especially the 4-mid-episodes of the show), but it was not too mundane to put me off. Sometimes I found my self wondering, \"why the fuck are they dicking around instead of doing some shit relating to magic.\" But towards the last half of the series, I felt that this is a wonderful story about how a group of students had gone through trails and tribulation and became friends. In the end, I could say that I enjoyed the show. This show is for those of you who like a moderately paced slice of life show, with some element of fantasy sprinkled into it.",

            "content": "I knew exactly what i was in for when i saw the first few minutes of the first episode of this anime. The beginning of the show has a girl in a fish suit dancing, floods of school girls running towards their school in an empty city, and a bear panty flip skirt scene, and all this sets the mood for most of the show. I still continued on mostly for the fact the this series is having a sequel (in some sense) coming out soon, and i just had to see what it was all about. I just wanted to know what would allowfor this show to have a spinoff, 3 separate ovas, and a sequel 13 years later.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime follows Negi, a 9 year old kid who is a mage and is also the newest teacher in an all girls school, i think. Because you see, the setting takes place in this school/city that has different areas for different schools, and is pretty much why there was a lot of girls running in the beginning since that is there section of the town. Why is this such a thing? I really don't know, and they really don't delve into it. Anyway Negi is assigned to a all girl middle school for his mage training although i don't see how any of this connects together other than that the principle, and some of the staff are mages or at least connected to the magical world. It's never delved into as well. It's mostly just a setup for the school harem that will take place with a teacher , but it's ok now since the the teacher is a kid. Well it's easy to say that all the girls take a liking to him due to how cute he is, and it could have been left just as girls liking a cute kid. However the show goes beyond that and has some of the girls having romantic feelings for him, and even setting out to get a kiss from him. \\n\r\nNothing really interesting happens in the show with most episodes focusing on a character. While there are \u201cstory arcs\u201d in the show it still for the most part focusing on a character or two. There is action and tension in the show, but it  falls flat most of the time because it tries to set out to be something else but it still maintains the same tone. There\u2019s also no buildup to anything which allow things to happen without any proper reasoning. It does later in the story shift tone pretty well, but when it gets there, it gets absurdly over dramatic until finally going back to status quo. For much of a story it was at least easily digestible, but mostly for the part that there wasn\u2019t a lot of meat in it\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n31! That\u2019s how many students are in the class and given that this is only 26 episodes long be unamazed that many of them are glossed over. Not only them but all the other characters as well from the staffs of the school, and even the antagonists. All these girls are defined mostly by a quirk or hobby that they have, and that\u2019s about it. However some of the girls do get an episode of their own, and they sure do leave an impression on the viewers, but once it\u2019s done they usually go back into the background. There are really three characters that have more relevance in the show than anyone else. First is negi the young welsh mage who is sent to teach at  school for no apparent reason other than just because. Negi was never supposed to reveal that he was a mage or else he would be kicked out of the school, but that\u2019s kicked to the wayside when more than \u2156 figures him out but no consequences ever happen to him.  Next is Asuna who is more of the main girl since the show really does focus on her a lot more than anyone else. She basically a tsundere who has a crush on one of the teachers, and was one of the first to figure out negi was a mage because of her special ability that\u2019s never really explained. Finally is Nodoka who is a shy girl who gets more screen time than for her own good with her defining characteristic is liking negi and her character development being have the courage to confess.\\n\\n\r\nThe art looks pretty basic. The character designs are basic and sometimes some characters look like each other, the background designs are basic, and the color palette doesn\u2019t look any special. The animation is also just as basic but it really shows how substandard it is when anything worth of action occurs, and it just feels so underwhelming. Everything is still easy to put up with, but nothing really stands out. The soundtrack to the anime is decent for the most part although there are probably only two tracks that really stand out, and even they are forgettable. Everything else is standard fare when it comes to a comedic school story. The voice acting is ok as well, it\u2019s rather diverse with each character sounding unique but not much else.\\n\\n\r\nThis show was dumb which was pretty much what i expected from it. I had a decent time, and there was nothing really wrong with how the show played out even though it was quite dumb. However it was the last few episodes that made the show less enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it is a really forgettable show, and nothing really stand out that makes this anime any special.\\n",

            "content": "I wasn't sure what to expect coming into this anime, described as being about a 10-year-od teaching a class of middle school girls, tagged as harem and ecchi. On the whole, I found it to be easy to watch and enjoy without it getting too heavy with the drama. The story was well done and at times delightful.\r\nI especially loved the characters and how they developed over the course of the show. Negi is portrayed well in terms of the balance between having to be the teacher and authority figure in the classroom, and being a boy younger than the class he teaches. Asuna isflawed yet likeable as the lead female character, and Chomo is amusing as the comic relief ermine. Something that especially impressed me is that all 31 of the girls in Negi's class had faces and names, and most of them had a significant supporting role in at least one or two episodes of the series. By contrast, most series in a setting like this would focus on no more than about 8 or so characters while the rest become nameless background characters, whereas this one does a surprisingly good job of making the whole class look real without distracting too much from the primary characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is kind of odd-sounding at times, yet oddly fitting. The art generally very good, though not particularly exemplary or stylistically notable.\\n\\n\r\nLet me also address that ecchi tag. There are a few instances of characters in their undergarments, or even portraying them nude in such places as public baths, but they generally have a sort of youthful innocence about them. There is little if any of the sexual innuendo or eroticism commonly seen in ecchi portraying characters a few years older. What relationships develop between characters are reasonably in keeping with the ages of the characters - middle school crushes and such.\\n\\n\r\nThe final story arc has some heavier drama in it than the rest of the series up to that point, and I felt uncertain going into the last couple of episodes. Let it suffice to say that the final episode has a couple of surprises that some might say are over the top but I thought they worked well and were a pleasant turn of events to see. It ended well and left me liking it more than I expected to, or thought I would even a few episodes in.",

It entertains the viewer enough as to keep them watching.\r\nIt includes comedy, drama, fantasy, and a bit of action. The comedy is just fine, like any other average comedy serie; drama is a bit tacky since it relies on the average romantic plot where two characters meet but do not accept their feelings until the very end of the serie; fantasy doesn't even needs to be explained i guess (Negi, the main character, is a wizard; I think that's enough explanation); and the action part is just above the borderline of being acceptable.\r\nTheshow is missing a definite storyline throughout the whole series, it seems just like a whole bunch of different things put together in each episode (except, maybe, in the last few episodes). Art is nothing out of this world, missing out on lots of detailing. The intro song is kinda fun, it's very lively; it suits the series pretty well. The characters are all very different and fun, each one of them being a different stereotype, basically.\\n\\n\r\nYou can spend your time watching this series, you'll have fun with it. ^^",

            "content": "Mahou Sensei Negima is rather odd. It is kind of like if you take a harem, made the girl population about thirty times the boy population, and then made the boy, like, four years younger than the girls. Actually, that pretty much sums up this series. Ken Akamatsu, who created the show's manga, is also rather well known for his previous series, Love Hina. In my opinion, this show far surpasses Love Hina, and here's why.\r\nStory 8/10\r\nThe story of Negima starts off like your typical harem, but gradually evolves to become so much more. By the end of it, the girls aren't entirely the mainfocus, as the wizardry and magic also plays a strong role. It becomes somewhat of an unpredictable roller coaster of fun, from computer battles to a haunted mansion/pillow fight to an adventure into the depths of a library. Very entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art for Negima looks good for 2006, but now.... Not so much. This looks aged, and the style is very simplistic. Still I have to give it props for looking good for 2006... When it isn't being compared to Haruhi or Black Lagoon.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is good, but not amazing. It has tracks that provide good atmosphere, but nothing more. What I do have to give props for, however, is the dub. The dub was done by Funimation, and quite frankly, it sounds amazing. Memorable performances include Luci Christian, Laura Bailey, and Caitlin Glass. Trust me, dub is the way to go for this one.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is Negima's problem with having such a large female cast: not everyone gets an episode or even 5 minutes. But when they do, it's good. Stand-out characters include Asuna, our tsundere-baka, Evangeline, our Loli, Yue, our sarcastic bookworm, Chisame, our tsundere computer chick, and Kazumi, our hyper photographer. The rest are just okay.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\\n\r\nNegima is one of those series that you know isn't good, but is entertaining to watch. It has some solid humor, a cool plot, and some interesting characters. It's more popcorn material than anything, yet remains entertaining. I recommend watching it with friends.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\\n\r\nIt has it's flaws, but is still solid enough to watch. Stream at your leisure!",

I noticed that this one has alot more emphasis on the harem aspect of the sereis alot ore thsn the magic or story. There is a story, just not one important to remember. I've watched the entirety of the Remake, and i honestly felt that the remake turned the Harem aspect to its side. In this one, Negi is having to worry about all of the girls flling in love with him. As for the remake, the Harem part is due tohim having to have multipe partners. I noticed that in the original, one of the characters is a ghost, and (if i am not mistaken, since i haven't seen through to the end yet) basically is there as wasted space. In the Remake, she has more of an importance.\\n\r\nThe intro to this one has basically a bunch of the girls in this series hitting a beach ball, with the picture changing to different sets of 3 girls. As for the other intro, you would just have to look it up. (1000% Sparkles -English Version recommend unless you don't  care about if it is dub or sub, then it is just fine as it is)\\n\r\nTo finish off this review, if i were to recommend you watch this, DO NOT watch the Remake BEFORE you watch this one! This will save you the trouble of being disappointed(wish i knew beforehand).",

Rather than following the typical \"take a guy and throw him in a house full of girls\" ala Shuffle or Sister Princess, Negima takes a guy and throws him in a school filled with girls. Negi, the main character, is a 10 year old genius who has graduated college at the age of 10 and is teaching at an all girls middle school. He also happens to be a young British wizard, which helps pull in the Harry-Potter-watching demographic I suppose.\r\nMany of the episodes unfold like a typical date-sim turned into an anime series, where there will be a concentration onone of the girls in the class. The whole series remains pretty fluffy and lighthearted until episode 21 or so, and then becomes a bit serious so there can be some form of conflict and climax to end the series. I could pretty easily watch 100s of Negima episodes, as it's a good way to wind down at the end of the day, but those of you looking for more serious fare or something less cookie-cutter should look elsewhere. Animation is very typical, nothing poor nor exceptional.",

It's far too cutesy, it doesn't have any of the more serious elements of the original manga and they even portray the characters differently. I think they should have relabeled the anime as a spin off rather than the anime interpretation of the manga.\nThat aside (I'm going to pretend that i haven't read most of the manga.\nIt's a great anime, very cutesy,a little, slightly disturbing romance, some good fight scenes and some moments that will make you cry. If it wasn't negima, I probably would have watched anyway, as it does have a good storyline and makes quite a change to the usual high school romance and supernatural scene.\\n\\n\nTaking the manga into consideration, I'd give it a 4/10, but if you haven't read the manga, I'd say 9/10 and definitely worth watching. I have based my scoring on not taking the manga into consideration as this is a review of the ANIME in the end.",

This anime is about Negi who is with 31 girls, I couldn't name a few. Negi guides those girls on how to make good use of magic.\r\nI also realised that if there are too many characters then the development most likely will diminish. However, I don't think that's the case in this anime. What makes an anime enjoyable to me is the character that I can relate well with. \r\nThere are 2 characters which I like and enjoy:\r\n#1: Evangeline Mcdowell\r\nA vampire whois ageless. Very mysterious and badass even in episode 21, she saved Negi from the evil guy. In fact, she is a very unique vampire not like Yuki Cross from Vampire Knight and the Twilight characters who have no personality. She is also intelligent. By the way, Yuki Cross is a crybaby.\\n\\n\r\n#2: Setsuna Sakurazaki\\n\r\nA badass swordswoman who is mysterious, calm and collected. She also cares deeply or Konoka.\\n\\n\r\nWithout these 2 characters, I wouldn't enjoy this anime. I also know that this anime couldn't possibly cover all the back story of all the characters due to limited time of episodes. But it doesn't matter, as long as the characters are not annoying, that is fine. The rest of the cast, I cannot say much.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending of the anime implied that Asuna was really crying for Negi's help. I don't understand why did she do such a thing? I feel dissappointed about the ending. Why did she become a crying mess in the end? \\n\\n\r\nI feel that my most disliked character in this anime is Asuna, who is stubborn and a damsel in distress. Not only that she is a tsundere, who gets violent easily. And yet, Negi has feelings for her. I also don't care if people say that she is princess-like. There are people who are princess-like and yet show me good attitudes in anime eg. Feena Earthlight\\n\\n\r\nOk. Never mind. I have to say that it was all right but not great. My rating was toned down due to the pacing and the ending. Not to mention some annoying characters like Asuna. The good thing about the show is the action scenes and likable characters like Evangeline & Setsuna.\\n\\n\r\nI give this show a 6 out of 10. That's all.",

Orphan boywizard wants to become a great wizard like his father was.  It gets original when he's chosen to be a teacher at an all girls middle school to complete his wizardry training, but he must do it while keeping his mage status secret (which he repeatedly fails at).  The fact that many of the girls are outright Shota-cons is a little silly, but it ups the fun quotient at the same time.\\n\r\nThe story moves along but some of the episodes are silly, like the \"dramatic\" dodgeball fight.\\n\r\nThe anime's original ending is quite emotional, but really hooks you into it.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is simplistic, even compared to the sequel series.  The drawing is almost minimalist and they didn't go to any special efforts to wow the viewer.  The art was pretty forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nSound: This anime's weakest link.  It was never inappropriate or ill-fitting; but it was entirely forgettable and the opening was almost trite in it's childishness.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: It's the characters that drive this show and make it fun.  The main character Negi has a class of 31 students, all of them interesting and unique.  They all have different hobbies, histories, motivations, and secrets (a WHOLE lot of secrets).\\n\r\nI can't go into too much detail since I could take up pages.\\n\r\nNegi and Asuna (the boy wizard and the student who first finds out about his abilities) are the primary protagonists.  Negi is well written, but rather simplistic (he's only 10) as well.  Most of the humor of the series is him getting into trouble either through magic or through the attentions (not always appropriate) of his students.\\n\r\nAsuna is the type of character who doesn't exist outside of animes.  Overhyper, super fast and strong, and hot-tempered.  She develops more character as time goes on and gains more backstory.\\n\\n\r\nOne can't mention characters in Negima without a huge shoutout to an early antagonist turned protagonist, Evangeline Anastasia \"Kitty\" McDowell.  Vampire Girls are nothing new to anime.  Even vampire girls who dress in (even called this by the character herself in the manga) \"Goth Loli\" are nothing new (disturbing).\\n\r\nYet you never see one have as much fun playing the villain.  Naturally in an anime like this she secretly is a sweet girl, but she outright enjoys being one of the badguys.  She doesn't bring the usual skycap of vampire angst to  the party; making no excuses for who she is and what she has done.  The only sappy part is her crush on Negi's father, but even their interaction was humorous.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Despite a few \"dud\" episodes, this show is very enjoyable.  With a lot of humor and some satisfying action at times; the overall experience is very positive and emotional at times.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I highly recommend this series.  Though it can get a little sappy at times, it's a fun watch with something for everyone.\\n\\n\r\nPros: Huge cast with great storylines and they are all unique and even poke fun at some classic stereotypes.  Very funny in places but can get serious at times; giving a good mix of humor, drama, and action.\\n\\n\r\nCons: Follows the manga which developed slowly and you are left wanting more that is never delivered (sequel series is an original script with more comedy).  The artwork is nothing amazing and the soundtrack is a dud.\\n\\n\r\nLastly the ending episodes is an emotional cartwheel, with some of the saddest scenes I've ever seen in an anime, followed by a dramatic reversal for the expected happy ending.\\n\r\nIf one is looking for a similar story with a lighter plot, I recommend the sequel \"Negima!?\" which has a lot more comedy while sacrificing character development.\\n",

            "content": "(I don't know why i'm just now writing a review for one of my favorite manga's anime adaptation) \r\nMahou Sensei Negima!? (Also known as Negima!? Magister Negi Magi in the US [Or was that Japan? I dunno, doesn't matter which name you use]) as I have already stated, is one of the best mangas I have read to date and probably my favorite manga. I have different opinions about the anime though, despite Ken Akamatsu's genius manga. \r\nNegima!? (what I will call it for now on during this review) is one of the worst adaptations of a manga I have ever seen. The art isATROCIOUS! I only gave it a four because it is an......aged...... show so the graphics won't be as good as the modern day graphics in anime. My problem is not only with the art. The story in the beginning is loose, not making sense to me, but in the end it kinda gets better (I guess) and pieces start coming together. I'm trying to break this into as many paragraphs as possible so I will come back to the flaws later. On to the good stuff.\\n\\n\r\nDespite those other flaws I was talking about, the rest of the show is kinda good. I can particularly note how much I binge watched this show. After watching the second adaptation (I like calling the first Mahou Sensei and the second Magister Negi Magi), Negima!? Magister Negi Magi, which was made by a different studio, resulting in different graphics, you realize how bad Mahou Sensei was and how much better Magister Negi Magi was. I binged both. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this show are developed well, but the less relevant characters (Misora, Madoka, Satsuki) get less story time than the more relevant like Asuna, Chachamaru, and Chamo (who me and my friend got in a heated argument about how to pronounce his name. Is it Camo [as in military camo] or Chamo [as in Chamo but pronounced how it looks: Cha-Ammo, now put it together. Chamo. Note: I say Camo]). My personal favorite is Asuna (Not pronounced the same as SAO Asuna), mainly because she is my waifu. There aren't really any main characters (Other than Asuna and Negi) because most of the critical characters get the most story time (Example: Evangeline, although she has a part in almost every episode) but aren't classified as main characters during the anime. \\n\\n\r\nI can't really rate sound. It is okay I guess. The voice actors can play the part. The thing I just HAVE to mention before the end of this review. The story tries to make something the manga is not. This is partly why it got another adaptation. The story gets derailed after the first few episodes and it kinda becomes crap after a while. I understand why it got a second adaptation after seeing this anime. The art, the story, ugh. It was enjoyable despite all these flaws. At least it was entertaining.",

            "content": "= Spoiler free, opinions based on my view back in 2010. =\r\nWell. Back in early 2008, i think. This anime was broadcasted in my place, and its really extremely censored, probably this was broadcaster fault for showing ecchi anime.\r\nBut after watch whole episodes back then, I fully regret the whole of it.\r\nThe main reason maybe this occurs is when :\r\n1 + You read the manga before watching anime.\r\n2 + You watched the anime then after done, read manga.\r\n\"Ecchi\". Isn`t. Do not mistakes \"Ecchi\" and non \"Ecchi\" in thiis anime, conpared to manga which completely ecchi genre. Probably this is because the anime fix to Shounenanime, which to make appeal to younger children rather than teen. Yeah.\\n\\n\r\nPlot are much butchered in this anime, trying to create original plot rather than manga plot, of course no need to follow manga completely. But when anime stays into that plot, while manga already go further, well anime stays dead on that scenes, unless reboot occurs.\\n\\n\r\nAnd while to look at the arts, arts are really pale and blant. Probably because its 2005, but I seen there`s more 2005 anime that has good animation back then. \\n\\n\r\nBut hey, I don`t really cons this anime, there`s still good points through. Such as numerous characters with different personality but memoriable characters. Voice acting was pretty solid, even through music isn`t great in whole anime. OP was good.\\n\\n\r\nThen again. Like I said.\\n\r\nI prefer manga than anime. I read the whole chapter. This anime devoid most of its charming. It makes coffee taste like drainage.\\n",

            "content": "I was realy hyped when i heard about the negima anime i couldnt wait to see it, i even watched the japanese version with english subs, and i hate doing that i miss whats happening cause im to busy reading. Anyway when i finaly saw it, i loved it, yet i couldnt shake the feeling of dissapointment. \r\nThe story was great but this is also where i think it failed as well. The story was good and easy to follow but it didnt exactly follow the manga which i was really dissapointed with since i loved the manga. Take the school trip episodes for instancethey had the battles and all but they left ou some people, like Kotaro Inugami where was he? he plays a massive role in the manga so where is he in the anime? It also didnt help that he was my Fave charater in the manga so i got so p****d when i found out he wasnt in it.\\n\\n\r\n An interesting point about the story though was Asuna Kagurazaka's death, that i was not expecting. It was one hell of a twist. I think this is easily the most upsetting part of the entire series. When you see the class and how upset everyone is, epsecial her best friend Konoka Konoe its so touching, but it was great to see she came back thanks to choas time machine. \\n\\n\r\n The Art/Graphics of this anime are stunning all the spells and such cast are beautiful, as well as the scenery. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters where great had every main character in it, except Kotaro... I honestly think that some of the voices (english dub) where kinda bad, like Negi Springfields voice, i know hes ten and all but still why did they have to make it so squeeky? \\n\\n\r\nThe whole anime put together was amazing, to be honest i think it is better if you watched the anime then the books because you dont get to attached to the story, characters etc of the manga then get dissapointed that the anime left alot out. So i would definately reccomend watching this just dont be to dissapointed if youve alrady read the manga.",

            "content": "When you see this anime, please do so before reading the manga. While the anime is good enough when it is watched alone, it doesn't follow the manga's storyline at all, has a lot of fillers and leaves stuff out. A disappointing thing if all you want to see is the manga fights being shown more awesomely in the anime. Not even close. All the fight as ridiculously shortened, the characters' overall power is greatly reduced and with everything being heavily censored so even the comic parts that bring some ecci filled relief to story is reduced to some badly executed perverted stuff.\r\nAnother thing thatreally annoyed me was the way that the character were drawn, not up to standard and with some color happy person applying a different hair color to the characters which are utterly ridiculous. Takes some time to get used to if you read the manga. Also the voices do not match the person and no trace of any accent other than Japanese. Pretty bad when you consider an English person speaking English in a Japanese accent (teaches English).\\n\\n\r\nAll in all it is good, but the manga is much better. Watch only if you haven't seen the manga or if you can't get enough of the series and is able to bear much of the disappointment just to see some of the parts that were enjoyed in an animated way, if they are included or still resemble how they were in manga.",

The main eight-or-so characters are adorable, and there is good character development on them, we eventually learn a little about all the students.  The story is pretty light for awhile, with a lot of comedy and slice-of-life episodes that help you to understand the characters better, and build up an overall story line. \r\nThe most surprising thing about this series is whathappens in the last few episodes. The story line takes a sudden turn towards the serious, and the drama that unfolds is riveting and heart-rending and will keep you pressing \"play\" long past your bedtime. There is a lot of fan service and I would definitely put this anime in the PG category. Overall, I think it is one of the best light-hearted animes out there, even if it is in the harem category.\\n",
