The fast-paced actions scenes coupled with the well thought out actions of the characters (albeit gruesome) create an absolutely thrilling experience. \r\nCharacters:\r\nThe contrasting natures of the two main characters are enthralling. Ash being the stubborn and intelligent gang leader with a dark history, and Eiji a timider character just starting to regain his lost courage.  In addition to this, I would like to point out the effort that has gone intothe intriguing backgrounds of the MC's. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art fits well with the story and does a fantastic job of properly portraying the characters.\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nAdmittedly, I'm one of those people who just skip the beginning, so I'll leave up to you to form your own opinion about this. \\n\\n\r\nOveral Enjoyment:\\n\r\nAlthough I typically watch animes more on the line of The Irregular at Magic Highschool and was very reluctant to watch Banana Fish. Looking back, it was a move I don't regret taking. Whether you are like me, obsessed with the idea of magic, a thrill-seeking horror devotee, or simply someone watching for enjoyment. Banana fish will prove to be one of your favorite animes this season.",

            "content": "At the age of 8, after his notorious debut role in the critically acclaimed cult show, Boku no Pico, Ash \"Pico\" Callenreese ran away from his home in Cape Cod to escape social pressures and was taken into the custody of Papa Dino (or simply, Papa), the leader of the Corsican Mafia, to become its future leader. Turns out Ash does not wish this to happen, but Papa like really wants, so naturally we now have a series about 2 gay mafiosos running after each others because neither of them wants to change their opinion. One could even go as far as declare they aren'tthinking very straight.\\n\\n\r\nI read Banana Fish manga 7 years ago and didn't like it very much. After seeing the anime getting produced by MAPPA (which I adore), I assumed/hoped the anime adaptation could do better job dealing with the drama, action and even character design - which were all pretty problematic with its shojo art style and female target audience which seemed to be quite limited to fujoshi pandering. I am saying this as a guy who has read over 400 shojo manga, and in generally appreciates works aimed for the demographic. The anime is already better, but it didn't fix its characters or story. \\n\\n\r\nMy biggest problem are the characters - who, on the other hand, are driving the narrative - which means the story is also problematic because the characters are. For some reason, whenever there is a criminal warlord -- who has removed themselves from the shackles of modern society, created their very own world and hierarchy similar to the one they escaped themselves -- the same person wants to push their own shit and agenda onto others. \"Don't do like I do, do like I say.\" Papa is not manly man nor a bro dude. He is an asshole with terribad double standards, who thinks he knows better what others should do. I rarely appreciate control freaks and narratives that are driven by some baddie acting like a freaking plot element. But that's exactly how Banana Fish works. Ash and Eiji - AKA the runaway gay couple - are not much better. Ash acts like a brat, and Eiji is more obviously gay than any other character.\\n\\n\r\nThe writing mainly reminds me of a show 2 cours back called Citrus. Series where every character was a lesbo and the lesbian was shoveled down the viewers throat. Banana Fish is practically the male version of that show. Everyone is gay, looks gay or at least talks about gay people. Ash calls one dude a faggot for watching homo porn... where Ash himself is the porn star. Good comedy, I guess. Every time we meet a new character who knows Dino, he casually mentions \"btw, that dude is gay.\" If there ever is a character who doesn't announce they either enjoy shotas, manly buttholes, or are in a gay relationship, you can safely assume that they are at least checking 2 of the 3 mentioned because apparently, executing a show about gay people is best done in a manner similar to ecchi series which promote being hetero with boob fondling, pantsu shots and nose bleeding. \\n\\n\r\nThe actual events are a collection of cliches from kidnapping incidents to mexican standoffs. And of course, every Ash's \"assassination\" plan fails because none of the million people who attack him brought any guns. Baseball bats and random pipes are just that more efficient in a fight where the opposing party uses a fucking magnum. But don't worry! It's all just part of the bigger plan. Whenever anything happens, you know it is just an excuse for the story to go in the direction the author prefers. This is beyond visible and obvious in the series. Oh, and how are the kidnap incidents overcome, you ask? Simply by one of the characters announcing how one of the kidnappers is gay, followed by Ash trolling them with his cuteboy butt, and voila! the day has been saved once again. \\n\\n\r\nThe worst part of the production itself is that these are the production values to this anime, when they could be the values to something that is good. Go watch Gungrave, 91 Days (pronounced 91 Gays), Rainbow Nisha, Gangsta, Speed Grapher, Kekkai Sensen, or even Dogs instead. Come back to this one only if none of those pleased the manly mobster love in you, and even then, be prepared for some extra nonsense.",

            "content": "[Updated after episode 9] Since starting to watch this show I've quickly learned why Banana Fish's manga is one of the most well recieved and impactful manga of all time in Japan; Banana Fish's animated adaptation is rapidly shaping up to become one of my all time favourite anime. \r\n-Story- \r\nEssentially the plot is that Ash Lynx, a 17 year old gang leader and abuse survivor, is caught up in the fallout over a thing or entity named \"Banana Fish\", linked to his brother Griffin and the war in Iraq. Ash's boss and abuser Dino wants the drug back. Meanwhile 19 year old Eiji fromJapan arrives as a photojournalist covering New York's gangs, but gets caught up in the conflict. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot, while certainly reliant on genre tropes, makes for an excellent thriller. There's never a dull moment in any of the episodes, aided by a smart and fast adaptation of the manga. Not an episode goes by without a few major developments and plot twist or three. Intelligently, the series doesn't focus *too* much on the mystery of what \"Banana Fish\" is, with plenty of other plot developments going on aswell. Don't worry though, there are fairly quick answers as to the truth about \"Banana Fish\", and it's turning out to be more interesting for the plot than you think seem at first. \\n\\n\r\nWhile not grimdark, Banana Fish isn't a happy series - there's mentions and (non-explicit) depictions of eg child abuse, violence, and sexual assault, though it's balanced out by some typically shojo sweet or funny moments. The subject is approached with respect and isn't sensationalised or sexualised for the viewer. Rape and child abuse is depicted as an being about an abuse of power rather than sex, and is always told from the point of the view of the victim traumatised by what they went through. The show also discusses topics such as victim-blaming and disbelief of people's experiences, especially from sources of authority including government and the police - issues that continue to be as relevant today as the 1980s when the manga was written. \\n\\n\r\n-Characters-\\n\\n\r\nWhile the plot is intriguing, BF's key strength is in its' characters and the emotional impact the plot's twist and turns have on both them and we as the viewers. The cast is interesting and fresh all round, with almost every character being very likeable (or hateable for the villains) and memorable. The characters and their struggles are the beating core of this series. Honestly, I've rarely felt as emotionally invested in an anime; Banana Fish succeeds in getting you to care deeply about the characters before putting them into horrific situations - contributing to the strong emotional impact of the recent episodes. \\n\\n\r\nAsh is becoming one of my favourite anime characters ever. He's overcame great adversity, but doesn't treat himself as a victim. He's sassy and confident in getting back at his numerous attempted rapists and abusers, and always resourceful in taking down his enemies. You''ll root for him as he sets out to take revenge on the men - especially Dino - who've ruined his life. No only that, but he's actually really smart and well read which goes against stereotypes for this kind of character. \\n\\n\r\nEiji is pretty much the polar opposite to Ash, being naive about and unaccustomed to the world of the mafia. He seems shy though lovable at first, but in ep 2 and 3 we see that he's a lot braver than we thought. He's already really committed to helping out Ash. Honestly you'll grow to love him pretty quickly, he's likely to be the most relatable character for most viewers. \\n\\n\r\nShorter has swiftly become a fan favourite, winning from many the accolade of best boy. He's a good counterpart and friend to both Ash and Eiji, being a fun character to watch but also quick to come to the rescue of the protags when they need it. He definitely comes across much better than the manga, with his updated design - now keeping that mohawk - and more expressive animations. \\n\\n\r\nYut Lung is introduced a bit later so I don't go into as much detail about him, but he's an interesting mirror image to Ash, and a strong presence on screen helped by his VA Fukuyama Jun. \\n\\n\r\nBF succeeds in making you really hate its villains. Dino is a mafia boss and a dirty old man - but there seems to be something deeper below the surface in his relationship with Ash. One of his underlings, Arthur, \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n-LGBT representation- \\n\\n\r\nBanana Fish is famous for being one of the formative works in the BL genre and has a good number of LGBT fans. If anyone is misled by the \"Yaoi\" tags this series has on some sites, there is nothing sexual in the relationship, it is purely platonic. That doesn't make it less valid though.  Many viewers will appreciate the depiction of an close non-sexual platonic relationship between two men. \\n\\n\r\nAt the moment its only a third of the way through the show's runtime, but I'm assured by manga readers Ash and Eiji's relationship is going to get much deeper and more emotional as things go on. But already, the groundwork for their relationship has been set, and the anime is notably putting more emphasis on their relationship than the manga did up to this point. \\n\\n\\n\r\n-Art- \\n\\n\r\n BF is a very solid outing from studio MAPPA, aided by the visual storytelling skill of Free!'s season 1 and 2 director. The designs have been updated a bit for animation but are still recognisably 80s, a nice change of pace from the usual modern art style. Ash doesn't look as good as his manga counterpart, but Eiji, Shorter and other characters look better or about the same as they did in the manga. The animation does good work in depicting the characters, their expressions, body language and movements, etc., as well as the show's frenetic action scenes.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat I especially love is the use of different colour palates and background art. It really adds to the world and tone BF is aiming for and makes for a lot of visually interesting scenes. The anime is really building on the manga's artwork in many places which is great to see. There's so much personality and care put into the character's expressions and body language which brings the show's cast ti life. \\n\\n\r\nOverall BF is a pleasant treat for the eyes, and the visuals complement the emotional goals of the show very well. \\n\\n\r\n-Sound-\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting is excellent. Especially love Ash's VA, he fits the role very well, but everyone is in good form here. In particular the voice acting carries the more emotional and stressful parts of the story (like the most recent episode) brilliantly. \\n\\n\r\nOP and ED are excellent. The OP is one of the best of the year so far. The OST is also one of the best in recent anime, a lot of these tracks would be good to listen to on their own. The OST really fits the tone of each scene and adds a lot on top of the animation and voicework. \\n\\n\r\n-Conclusion-\\n\\n\r\nBanana Fish is flying under the radar at this point, but it doesn't deserve to. It's an easy frontrunner for AOTY so far, and I wholeheartedly recommend it if what you've read pique your interest. \\n",

            "content": "If there\u2019s one thing that\u2019s enticing about the Noitamina network, it\u2019s their way of broadcasting shows to a variety of audiences. Banana Fish seems like one of those shows that isn\u2019t aimed at a wider audience but it definitely has its own appeal. Taking place in a crime-noir setting, the series deals with teenage gangs in a corrupted city. It\u2019s a time period of recreation and Banana Fish sets a firm example of an old school crime drama resurrected to modern life.\r\nNow I have to admit, I\u2019m not too familiar with Akimi Yoshida\u2019s work or her style of writing. The only other series I\u2019ve readby her is a manga called \u201cYasha\u201d. It has no relation to this series but the artwork is distinctive with her work. Not to mention, her series evokes a sense of mystery that\u2019s present in Banana Fish. Yet, just what exactly is Banana Fish?\\n\\n\r\nTo be clear, the original manga was published from 1985 to 1994. This adaptation serves as a celebration of her 40th anniversary. It\u2019s also somewhat unusual that Noitamina adapted this into 24 episodes rather than their usual 11/22 format. Regardless, Banana Fish strikes to me as a refreshing experience. First impressions are important and this show accomplishes that with the aesthetic story setting. It shows New York in a crime driven state and conflicts dealing with mature content. It's also interesting to note that the series has a more modern feel compared to the 1980s. And that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg.\\n\\n\r\nA main appealing factor that drew me into the show is the character relationship and development. We meet Ash Lynx, a snarky young man who ran away from home. Despite his not-so-friendly attitude, Ash has charisma that makes him a person not to be underestimated. He also possesses a variety of skills that puts him on the wrong sides of the law. Being incredibly daring and never afraid to take risks, Ash stands by example as a daredevil. It\u2019s almost if he anticipates his death at any moment and isn\u2019t afraid to risk it for what he believes in. This puts him on the opposite side of Eiji Okumura, a photographer\u2019s assistant and college student. Unlike Ash, Eiji is a kind young man but often easily manipulated or gets caught into complicated circumstances. The story goes to show his character relationship with Ash. Now I\u2019m just going to throw it out there but there\u2019s heavy implication of BL context between the two. While not being too explicit, it\u2019s shown that Eiji develops a growing love towards Ash. On the other hand, Ash shows his own devotion with action that speaks louder than words. Ash\u2019s acts of self-sacrifice becomes a central part of their relationship as he takes on many risks to save his life. The story often involves with Ash\u2019s enemies exploiting his weakness and that would be Eiji. \\n\\n\r\nStill, the million dollar question remains. What exactly is Banana Fish? To be clear, the title itself isn\u2019t necessarily just about what Banana Fish really is. Rather, it\u2019s a pivotal component of the plot that has Ash investigate into. In essence, Banana Fish delivers a sensation of mystery and suspense. The main premise focuses on how Ash\u2019s fight against the mafia in this rebellious age. Crime lords like Dino Glozine is the stereotypical antagonist you\u2019ll quickly love to hate. I don\u2019t mean that in the sense of him being a distasteful human being. Rather, Ash has a personal agenda to settle with him considering their dark history together. The series isn\u2019t shy to deliver mature context in the form of drug deals, criminal activities, sex slavery, or gang wars. If you\u2019re here to stay for the show, then be ready suck it up and indulge on these controversial topics. In the meantime, we also meet allies that Ash meets in his quest of vengeance. Characters such as Ibe, Max, Griffin, Alexis, and Jessica join to fight the good fight. In many cases, their roles all are important for the overall mission. On the other hand, their most prominent adversary is Corsican Mafia consisting of Dino and his crew. Deep down, this anime crafts these antagonists with intentions to destroy Ash\u2019s life. It becomes a crime thriller that often tests the limits of the main characters and how much longer they can last. Later in the show, we also meet other dangerous groups such as the Chinese mafia. Among their members includes the cunning Yut-Lung Lee who wants Ash\u2019s head on a plate.\\n\\n\r\nAt its core, Banana Fish shows that in their society, crime is more than just a social problem. In our society, criminal activities are not tolerated and punishable. In the world of Banana Fish, characters believe they are above the law. Some even believe they are the law. Let\u2019s take a closer look at Ash for instance. Having being raised by Dino, it\u2019s clear that he has a dark past that\u2019s explored more and more as each episode progresses. While I don\u2019t consider Ash to be a villain, there\u2019s no doubt that he has committed questionable acts. As this show takes place during a period of gang warfare, Ash stands out as more of an antihero to me than a protagonist. And of course, the man who raised him wants nothing more than to destroy Ash. I think in many cases, Dino wants to destroy Ash\u2019s soul rather than just his life. It\u2019s a fate perhaps worse than death and just one of the few examples of how cruel characters can really be. Indeed, Banana Fish contains mature content that isn\u2019t suited for a younger audience. Going back to what I said before, Noitamina\u2019s audience expands beyond than just a general audience and Banana Fish is an example of that.\\n\\n\r\nAdapting a manga from over two decades ago isn\u2019t an easy task. Manga being resurrected again after all this year tends to lose steam but I can say with supreme confidence that Banana Fish hits the marks. It manages to recreate a sensation of the 1980s while the anime takes place in a more modern setting. Rather than going with any flashy style of presentation, it commits to bring the manga\u2019s characters up to date. Characters such as Ash and Eiji are designed to look exactly how their personalities are meant to be. Gang wars and violence are showcased without holding back with the intense bloodshed. There\u2019s also some daring scenes of man service present that may be nerve wrecking or pleasing to watch. As I mentioned before, there are cases of gay moments although it\u2019s not distracting to the point of losing its main focus. Watch this series and you\u2019ll see that it\u2019s more than just a homosexual relationship between two men. In addition, I have to give some well-earned praise to the voice acting in the show. These characters are older than your typical high school students and crime lords like Dino isn\u2019t easy to portray. Yet, they all looked pretty damn believable in such a time period. \\n\\n\r\nBanana Fish is a show with a peculiar title that could probably be quoted often. It\u2019s Akimi Yoshida\u2019s most well-known work and MAPPA manages to produce such a series with commitment. Director Hiroko Utsumi worked on Free! in the past so it\u2019s no surprise that you\u2019ll see some man service along the way. But really, Banana Fish isn\u2019t just about a gay romance story between two guys. It celebrates the chance to showcase a crime story in a setting of corruption, revenge, and politics. Now it\u2019s your chance to experience that story.",

            "content": "*THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*\r\n\u201cHe very definitely told your father there's a chance \u2013 a very great chance, he said \u2013 that Seymour may completely lose control of himself.\u201d \u2013 J.D. Salinger.\r\nA soldier\u2019s life is one of hardships. Seen as the pride of a nation, they are tasked with defending the honour of their motherland with both flesh and blood. A life that requires chivalry, discipline and steadfastness. Their existence serves as a beacon light to the tame and cowardly; a source of inspiration for the youth to grow strong. But underneath all the glory and medallions reveal a darker tale more telling of their lives.Ordinary people before donning a uniform and sent off to war, a life of violence and suffering entails them. A hellish nightmare seeming to never end makes it near impossible to return to their former self. One must be physically and mentally tough to ever hope to survive such a turbulent time, but not everyone is capable of carrying that weight.\\n\\n\r\nJ.D. Salinger was one writer who certainly understood the pressures put upon people in severe circumstances such as war, through first-hand experience being drafted into the US army in 1942, even being hospitalized by \u2018combat stress reaction\u2019 months after Germany was defeated in World War II. He was clearly affected, going so far as stating \u201c[he] found it impossible to fit into a society that ignored the truth that he now knew.\u201d These events all informed his writing of the short story titled \u201cA Perfect Day for Bananafish\u201d. While numerous interpretations of the story do exist, the common belief is that it symbolizes those soldiers sent off to war and came back traumatized; gorged by the anguish brought on from war and stained of bloodshed. Decades later this short story would be loosely referenced to in the successful shoujo manga series Banana Fish, written and illustrated by Akimi Yoshida that would later be considered highly influential to the BL subgenre. And now over 20 years since the manga\u2019s initial release, Banana Fish received an anime adaptation produced courtesy by Studio MAPPA to run for 24 episodes in the latter half of 2018.\\n\\n\r\nBanana Fish focuses on the relationship between Ash Lynx, a cold ruthless teenage gang leader in New York City, and a na\u00efve assistant photographer from Japan in Eiji Okumura. Both men, despite appearing as polar opposites in personality and upbringing end up being caught in a fallout over an entity known as \u201cBanana Fish\u201d, that also happens to be related to Ash\u2019s brother and what occurred on his stint in Iraq. The pursuit of this mystery further pulls Eiji to the centre of this conflict, thereby leading to Ash pushing against the wishes of his bosses and gang members who put the safety of his newfound friend in jeopardy. It would be easy to summarize the story as simply a developing romance between two men, but the series is more concerned in making the story and overarching weight of it at the forefront of the tale, causing the narrative, despite being heavily reliant on genre tropes, to work effectively as a fast-paced charming thriller. The series uses heavy topics regarding drugs, sexual abuse, corruption and other mature themes to craft a careful drama that avoids sensationalizing the sheer brutality inherent with such subject matter. Likewise, these ideas further accentuate the thematic correlation between Salinger\u2019s \u201cA Perfect Day for Bananafish\u201d and this loosely inspired adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nNo other character is as carefully crafted nor developed to the same degree as the main protagonist Ash Lynx. His backstory alone would be enough to garner the sympathy of many: a boy who ran away from home at 8 years old only to be taken into custody by the head of the Mafia. Having been kidnapped as a sex slave numerous times later before being granted leadership of a street gang years later, he has seen his fair share of violence and trauma. Part of his likability derives from him never seeing himself as a victim and therefore is able to overcome adversity. However, his meeting of Eiji is what ultimately acts as the cause for Ash to slowly reveal himself emotionally and properly recover from trauma accumulated throughout the years. His character easily parallels that of Salinger\u2019s protagonist, as someone who has been exposed to so much that the idea of recovering from it all is improbable. Both of these characters take a liking to their more innocent counterparts, seeing in them what they once had but now have lost for reasons that were outside of their control. Clinging to that one person in the hope to keep them sane, and in the case of Banana Fish, no matter how the world might see Ash, Eiji will remain by his side. But similarly to Salinger\u2019s short tale, it may not be enough to help Ash change to a more civil lifestyle. \\n\\n\r\nDespite the original manga being set in the 1980\u2019s, Studio MAPPA decided to move the setting to a more modern time and as such caused various changes to the anime that deviate from the original source. Some of the most obvious examples include using character designs typical of the current animation standards rather that the original\u2019s well-defined character models, and the implementation of technology such as smartphones used by the majority of the cast. These changes, whilst they may come off slightly off-putting are fairly harmless in the grand scheme of things. Although when it comes to contemporizing the story and its themes, there are numerous issues that arise. For example, by revising the setting to present day, many of the topics covered can be considered outdated and requires a certain suspension of disbelief not to lose any immersion the viewer has with the world established. This take also renders most of the social commentary the original story had as nearly obsolete, which was one of the aspects that made the manga so important for its time. It\u2019s something that most viewers probably wouldn\u2019t have a problem with, as it still remains a piece of fiction that can be enjoyed without social context. But for those that want to look at this show deeper that the ordinary fan, it\u2019s an issue that can easily cause disappointment amongst certain anime fans.\\n\\n\r\nAnother key issue that I personally had throughout watching was how many elements regarding the plot and characters slowly become narrowed as the series continues. Allow me to elaborate; the beginning of this show was really appealing, not only on a visual level with how vibrant the settings were and the distinct designs on display, but with how many different parts there was to the plotline. From the main characters, to the supporting cast gang members, to the numerous villains, to everyone else involved, each of these groups felt like their own intricate parts to the storyline that had the potential to create something truly special. But as the plot continues, it becomes apparent that the storyline is only meant to focus on the relationship between Ash and Eiji. This is not necessarily a bad thing \u2013 Banana Fish revolves around this in particular. But I can\u2019t help but feel disappointed when a show with so many moving parts to begin with are funnelled out to prioritize all the screen time on the core plotline. Especially if comparing the anime to the manga, which gave more balanced attention to the large cast of characters intertwined. The villains all had varying degrees of depth but none of which I would honestly call complex, most characters not associated with a gang are shafted halfway through the anime and the gang members that are fleshed out are always given time and focus corresponding to their relationship with Ash. This is not a severe knock against the show, but I can\u2019t help it when I see a series like Banana Fish have so much potential and not seriously capitalize upon it.\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals for Banana Fish are a solid outing for Studio MAPPA. While I have my personal preference for character designs, the animation present here is energetic in how it depicts character movements and expressions, as well as providing the audience with some very exciting action scenes. The dynamic colour palette and background art are both visually appealing that while some might consider it detrimental to the tone of the show, I believe do better to initially attract anime fans to the series in general, acting as a pleasant treat for the eyes at first glance. The framing of the most controversial events that took place in Banana Fish was also commendable in giving the series a good sense of artistry. \\n\\n\r\nThe audio for Banana Fish is also praiseworthy with strong performances for voice acting overall, really capturing the essence of each main character. The soundtrack also fits most scenes well despite none particularly standing out, except for the OP and ED tracks which is just simply fun to listen to. No matter what your music taste, these tracks are pretty accessible and make for fun openers to each episode. The translations however could definitely act as a detriment to the series as a whole depending on your take of the sensitive topics covered in Banana Fish. Personally I found it funny when Ash calls a separate character a \u201cfag\u201d in the translation considering what the series is about, but some could easily take such as a homophobic slur and the anime as a whole as tone-deaf. Just be careful what you\u2019re getting yourself into, k? :)\\n\\n\r\nLooking back on Banana Fish, I see a series with a lot of upside to it. A carefully handled crime drama, innovative for its time, critically acclaimed source material, etc. And despite having my own criticisms against the series I would still recommend this to anyone interested in the series at all. Despite creative liberties it is at its core a well-made drama with emotionally powerful moments that are likely to entrance you in a tale barely brought to light by anime. There may be homoerotic undertones present, but the series was not made solely for such. Instead it clearly values a strong appreciation for storytelling, for that is how people from all different backgrounds are able to relate to what is told here at a fundamental level.\\n",

            "content": "Banana\u2019s look sort of phallic.  \r\nFish are high in omega-3 fatty acids.\r\nInvert the two and what do you have\u2026\u2026..a fat dick.  **badum-CHING**\r\nSummer is the time of year for promiscuous young-adults to experiment with their sexual desires, in a hassle free relationship that requires no commitments from either party.  But why limit one\u2019s exposure to the opposite sex, when there are plenty of \u201cgay-fish\u201d \u2014 I mean, banana fish \u2014 for the taking.  Why else would a Shoujo anime feature two young queens in New York?  For a \u201ccrime\u201d investigation?  Now that\u2019s rich.\r\nSpeaking of wealth, the main character in theshow, Ash Lynx, was groomed to inherit a vast amount of opulence and power through the successive process of becoming Dino\u2019s heir.  Be that as it may, the early steps of \u201cgraduating\u201d to his \u201cdestined\u201d role were mired with egregious abuses of standing law and personal freedom.  Not one to remain docile and allow circumstances to be determined by the judgement of others, Ash seized the initiative in an attempt to ameliorate the atrocities of his past.  This manifested into a plot to assassinate Dino via \u2014 and I kid you not! \u2014 standing on top of a moving truck in a public arena, while shooting a pistol.\\n\\n\r\nO\u2014KAY, then\u2026.\\n\\n\r\nNot one to put all his pumpkins in one basket, Ash used his adroit computer skills to plunder $90 million from Golzine and severely handicap his financial clout as a Mafia Don.  This blow to the ruthless Kingpin allowed Ash to claim an important victory and set the stage for the ensuing battle to come.  That being said, however, Ash\u2019s ability to steal Golzine\u2019s money and manipulate his company\u2019s stock price seemed too straightforward.  If Ash had that sort of capability, why not use that skill to make himself fabulously wealthy (say, like, a billionaire) and use his newfound fortune to assemble a crime syndicate that would dwarf that of Golzine\u2019s?  Furthermore, why did Ash risk his life with ridiculous, poor planned stunts when his intellectual prowess could easily circumvent Golzine\u2019s physical brutality?\\n\\n\r\nTo underscore this point, allow me to present the following:\\n\\n\r\n1)  Ash has an IQ of 180; placing him in an echelon of exceptionally gifted individuals (rarified air, if you will).\\n\r\n2)  Ash understands military-level tactics at a proficient level, commanding his gang to coordinate attacks against their various foes.\\n\r\n3)  His various senses are finely tuned and his anticipation of danger is second to none (well, maybe Batman has him beat).\\n\\n\r\nYet, instead of making use of these various skills to sidestep hazardous situations, Ash willingly embraced instability via having a knife fight in a subway station against his gang rival, Arthur.  In the midst of their battle, predictably, Ash get\u2019s ambushed by Arthur\u2019s gang \u2014 proving how poorly planned Ash\u2019s plans truly were \u2014 and is forced go John Wick on their candy asses (highly unrealistic, by the way), before his final Mortal Combat-esque showdown.\\n\\n\r\nLook.  Ash has far too many advanced abilities for his own good and they become contradictory at times.  Most protagonists who are portrayed as elite fighters have a weakness in the planning/thinking department and vice versa; however, Ash literally can/will do anything.  Even the greatest QB of all time, Tom Brady, can\u2019t run faster than a six year-old girl to save his life (butt-hurt Patriot fans incoming).  Counterbalancing greatness with a deficiency elsewhere is a great way to explore a character\u2019s resolve, through their willingness, or unwillingness to ameliorate their weaknesses.  Match Ash\u2019s flawlessness with his attractive appearance, and you have a character that is simply too good to be true.\\n\\n\r\nEiji be like, \u201che\u2019s a sweet candy bar in the bedroom, especially when he wears his nurse outfit.\u201d\\n\\n\r\n\u201cYes.  I can confirm this.\u201d  \u2014 Golzine\\n\\n\r\n\u201cMe too.\u201d \u2014 Shorter\\n\\n\r\n\u201cHershey chocolate is so delicious, sweet caaaaaaannnndddy bar.\u201d \u2014 Arthur, Max, Su Rin, Yut-Lung and about half of New York City (everyone except for the LAY-DEES!)\\n\\n\r\nThis brings up another concern with the story, that being that everyone and their father are homosexual, or have homosexual tendencies.  I have no qualms about an individual\u2019s personal choice, but is it conceivable to think that every man Ash runs \u201cinto\u201d has the hots for him?  Seems rather absurd, when only ~4.5% of the population identify as being gay.  \\n\\n\r\nDue to the plethora of melancholic moments throughout the series, it was quite evident that the conclusion of said events would not be a happy one.  Deducing the exact ending was nigh impossible (unless you read the manga), but anyone who presumed that Ash and Eiji would both survive their ordeal was ignoring the foreboding atmosphere established in the prior episodes.  This insight on \u201cwhere\u201d events would lead, sort of ruined a level of anticipation for the viewer, but not enough so to be a significant hindrance.\\n\\n\r\nThe review thus far has been scathing, but there are redeeming qualities that make Banana Fish worth watching.  While the characters within the show are not layered or terribly complex, they do come off as being \u201creal,\u201d particularly with the omission of classic anime tropes.  Their actions mirror that of \u201cnormal\u201d people, making the flagrant abuses seen or talked about feel extremely impactful.  It\u2019s hard not to become attached to Ash\u2019s cause of exacting revenge on Golzine, especially considering that his brother became entangled in the B1 (i.e. Banana Fish drug) \u201cexperiment.\u201d  Banana Fish, to its credit, pulls at the viewer\u2019s heart strings \u2014 perhaps, too frequently \u2014 to establish an atmosphere not unlike our world.  It damn near forces the audience to empathize with the plight of Ash Lynx and cheer him on as he dismantles the mob empire that robbed him of his innocence.  Is it rudimentary in its approach?  Yes, as indicated in the earlier parts of this review; nevertheless, Banana Fish provides exhilarating action sequences (even if they don\u2019t make sense within the context of Ash\u2019s projected character), moments of shock and awe, and some rather interesting character interactions.\\n\\n\r\nWith that said, Golzine\u2019s character felt pedestrian, exhibiting features that were not distinct enough to differentiate him from your standard mob boss.  The biggest takeaway anyone could discern from his screen time, is that he is a closet homosexual and he is infatuated with making Ash his sex slave.  In essence, he merely serves as a mark for Ash to conquer in his quest to liberate himself from the crime syndicate.  Marlon Brando\u2019s, Vito Corleone, is an excellent example of how one could/should construct a terrifying human being who instructs his \u201cbusiness associates\u201d to leave a horse head in a director\u2019s bead, but also lives by a set of principles and accumulates wealth for the sake of his family.  People, even the so called \u201cevil\u201d ones, will always have redeeming qualities that contrast the malicious activities they deem necessary to accomplish their goals.  Rarely does anyone consider their own actions to be immoral, giving a writing staff an opportunity to flesh out these \u201cjustifications\u201d and determine why these particular people think in ways that abnegate the norms of a typical society.  Deep, complex characters with diametric views always make for interesting conversations, forcing the audience to introspect and reconsider their own viewpoints about topics that have no clear answer.  Banana Fish, unfortunately, fails to entertain these narrative motifs.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR\\n\\n\r\nMuch like its namesake, Banana Fish is a mixture of good and bad.  How so?\u2026\\n\\n\r\nBananas are high in potassium and other useful nutrients; Bananas contain high amounts of carbohydrates.\\n\\n\r\nFish are high in omega-3 fatty acids, which lessens one\u2019s risk of experiencing a heart attack or stroke; Fish can have high amounts of mercury, leading to brain defects.\\n\\n\r\nBanana Fish is an exhilarating ride with a large cast of diverse characters; Banana Fish presents an unrealistic protagonist who takes unnecessary risks to take down an underdeveloped antagonist in Golzine.\\n\\n\r\n5/10\u2026.meh, make it 6/10 (tis the season, after all)\\n",

            "content": "Since its publication in a shoujo magazine in the 1980s, Banana Fish has received several labels such as boys\u2019 love (BL), shounen-ai, and yaoi due to popular misconceptions. Not only are these terms incorrectly applied to the work, but they also do not cut at the meat of what Banana Fish is. And even its original shoujo demographic tag deeply misrepresents the content of this anime. \r\nDrugs. Rape. Pedophilia. Gangs. PTSD. Violence. Corruption. \r\nThese are the terms at the core of Banana Fish. Though at the same time, the crime and gangster backdrop is not all the story is about and confining it within thoseboundaries massively undersells the broad scope of topics this anime covers. Because while Banana Fish's pragmatic and deplorable world is filled to the brim with death and sexual violence, the tale it tells of its main character, Ash Lynx, is a visceral story about life and love. And just as deliberate as its juxtaposition of death with life and lust with love, Banana Fish is a carefully woven story about dichotomies. Its two halves, like the darkness and light reflected in its two main protagonists, Ash and Eiji, permeate this character drama in numerous ways to paint a grounded tale about both the ugly and beautiful aspects that make us human.  \\n\\n\r\nWith little exposition to back it up, Banana Fish sets up intrigue from the outset and primarily uses its early episodes to build character back stories, motivations, and tension until its first major climax. From there, the copious amount of setup spent on its foundation gets grounded and becomes meaningful. Although Banana Fish has an overarching narrative, its story can be broken down into multiple arcs. The narrative shifts seamlessly from arc to arc; however, the tone between them can vary drastically. These tone shifts combined with Banana Fish's brisk pacing, does cause sudden mood swings, that at times lead to whiplash. But overall, its purposeful tonal dissonance is used to great effect to accentuate the light and dark themes that imbue its story. Its pacing allows eventful occurrences to happen every episode but sometimes hurts the show in its calmer hours. And unfortunately, the anime rushes a few episodes in the second cour to accommodate the daunting task of adapting nineteen volumes of manga into twenty-four episodes of anime. While in its other weaker moments, Banana Fish can suffer from clumsy plot developments, become somewhat fantastical, and get repetitive with both innocuous and annoying elements, overall, the story rarely ceases to entertain and because it is comprised of many moving parts, it often takes unpredictable turns that keep its audience on their toes. Though because a large amount of finer details were cut, viewers are required to pay close attention and often read between the lines, which at times, can lead to the discovery of surprise character nuance.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Banana Fish's story can be described as its weakest element, its characters are its strongest. Despite having a rather large cast of relevant main and supporting characters, Banana Fish adeptly characterizes the important ones in a short amount of time and consistently develops them throughout the narrative. As a result, characters as well as their interactions are both dynamic and engaging. At the center of this ever-evolving maelstrom of personalities is the two protagonists, Ash and Eiji. No other character in Banana Fish is as carefully realized or developed as Ash, who teeters between his hardened persona and vulnerable self seamlessly, but the complex, multi-faceted relationship Ash and Eiji share come close. Their relationship, while not the focus of the story, is just as important as the plot. It never becomes physical because of Ash's past, but the emotional connection between the two cannot be understated as it develops both protagonists and organically becomes the emotional foundation in which the narrative is founded upon. However, unfortunately, due to the limited episode count, several side characters are stripped of their more nuanced character traits that can be found in their manga counterparts. And even Eiji was regrettably simplified in the anime. Antagonists of varying degrees of depth and competence will come and go. All are twisted in their own way, most will be hated, and some are more than they seem. While Banana Fish is not one to have overly complex antagonists, mainly because writing sympathetic rapists and pedophiles goes against the themes of the piece, they all serve the narrative purpose that they were written for even if it is not entirely clear from the outset. However, Yut-Lung and Blanca deserve special mentions for not only being complicated and interesting, but for also highlighting Banana Fish's themes by serving as impressive foils. Each character has been made to life by talented voice actors, but most notably, Uchida Yuuma, the voice for Ash, has given a powerful performance with resounding care and heart put forth in conveying all of Ash's complexities.\\n\\n\r\nConsistent with other series produced by studio MAPPA, the animation and art quality are spectacular for the first several episodes before eventually becoming a series of ups and downs. The latter half of the show and the action-oriented episodes in particular have suffered as the anime progressed. For this sole reason, it is recommended to watch the Blu-Ray release, which has already been confirmed to have touchups. Despite its dips in animation and art, Banana Fish's cinematography remains very strong throughout its entire run. Storyboarding is consistently dynamic, and when applicable, framing is done with a certain message in mind. The music composed by Shinichi Osawa, also known by his stage name, Mondo Grosso, while not necessarily memorable, is distinct, stylish, and fitting. \\n\\n\r\nAs an adaptation, the anime does a commendable job in keeping the manga's spirit in spite of its brutally short episode count. MAPPA makes predominantly solid decisions on the material to cut and while the anime loses some of its plot cohesiveness as a result, prioritizing the character moments was the correct call. And in general, the manga is a highly recommended alternative for those interested in the gritty details that the anime had no choice but to leave behind. However, despite the strengths of this production, not all of MAPPA's adaptational choices enhance the experience. Most notably, the decision to update the original manga's 1980s setting to modern day in the anime has been baffling. Character designs have been modernized and smartphones have been given to the majority of the cast but the world continues to exude an anachronistic 80s vibe. While this may seem to be a harmless cosmetic overhaul, contemporizing Banana Fish means covering dated topics. This becomes most apparent when the anime delves into political maneuvers that would be more plausible in the Cold War environment that the original manga was written in. And because Banana Fish is a product of its time, the anime, though not always through the fault of MAPPA as Amazon has also mistranslated generic insults into homophobic slurs, contains elements that can be considered tone-deaf in today's sociopolitical climate. If anything, this adaptation should be treated as if the setting was still in the 1980s as the moderization Banana Fish's world received are largely superficial and even leads to plot inconsistencies. \\n\\n\r\nWith the vast majority of anime released nowadays abiding by successful formulas and character stereotypes, Banana Fish stands out as one of the rare few that is unafraid to take risks. Its brashness in that regard will inevitably land itself many criticisms but hidden beneath its rough exterior is a gem worth digging for. It touches upon heavy subjects without sensationalizing or sugarcoating their brutality and its grounded approach makes it a unique work that is more reminiscent of old Western action films and television than that of anime. It shows us the truly wretched sides of humanity but also reminds us of the hope and love individuals all possess while expertly invoking an array of emotions. From start to finish, it is a hauntingly real depiction of the very essence of being human. And despite the flaws in its story and adaptation, it leaves much to ruminate about. It is a deceptively simple story that can become complex in the themes it explores and the topics it leaves its viewers to ponder. Even the series' namesake, derived from the short story \"A Perfect Day for Bananafish\" by J.D. Salinger, and references to other American literature in the form of episode titles or overt mentions offer food for thought. Banana Fish is far from perfect, but at its core, it is an unforgettable rollercoaster of relentless action and raw emotion. The manga broke genre barriers over thirty-years ago and while the anime regrettably does not retain all the qualities that made the manga as groundbreaking as it was, it does deliver its own one of a kind experience with much of the same heart. There really is no other anime like Banana Fish. And it is one no one should miss.* \\n\\n\r\n*Disclaimer: but only if you can stomach the long list of heavy content this show has",

Does Banana Fish has scenes with two men sleeping together? Yes, but they are all without consent (except one, I think, maybe two depending on your idea of \"consent\") and the fact some male anime fans are writing this off as some sexy story for us fangirls is really demeaning to the struggles of Ash, the main character. Banana Fish does heavily hint at a romantic relationship between the twoleads but it's not in your face.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nBanana Fish does something most anime do not - they show sensitive topics like rape without fetishizing it or making a joke out of it. BF touches on almost every sensitive topic you can think of: murder, rape, drugs but almost all of it is treated as what it is: bad. The rape scenes are never explicitly shown or used as sudden shock factor. And remember, the manga came out in the 80s when this stuff wasn't even talked about as much nevertheless with such care and respect.\\n\\n\r\nNow as for the actual story, it can get a bit convoluted for sure, especially at the end, but it's never bad. It's definitely detailed though and pretty interesting, especially once everything gets moving at a faster pace around the middle of the story.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI absolutely adore the animation and character designs. That's all I can say; I think it looks great and smooth and fits the story really well.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI usually end up skipping openings after a few episodes, but BF has been an exception to this cause it's a really nice song that gets you pumped and sounds like something I'd listen to from some of my favorite American bands. As for the actual soundtrack, I don't pay much attention to that - sorry.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nBF is known for its amazing characters. Ash is a kid who went through hell and is just trying to survive. He's not afraid to get his hands dirty but time and time again shows he isn't some monster. Eiji starts out as a pretty spineless character but grows to stand by Ash's side as his friend (and maybe more). Then we get a lot of side characters who might be involved but in some shady things but prove they're human too: Shorter, Sing, Cain - two of which will be introduced later. They all stick by Ash's side and end up being really likable and interesting characters.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the bad guys? Completely despicable. They're not villains in a magical settling who use magic to take everything over or anything over the top like that - they are realistic terrible people doing things that happen in our real world and that's what's so scary.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSpeaks for itself. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nA lot of people are going to be turned off from BF cause of pretentious dude anime fans who think anything with any gay themes is just for fujoshis and should be skipped over but that's not the case. BF is an amazing story of friendship and tragedy and deserves to be given a fair shot. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

As a person who actually finished the manga 12 years ago, I'm here to tell you, don't fuckin drop this.\r\nComparing the anime and the manga based on ep 1. oh kami. The art is just beautiful. no homo but I didn't think Ash could get any hotter. Action scenes are engaging. It's a fast pace. Like it. The setting's pretty good.\r\nIf the anime is going to follow the manga completely, the story is going to be so fucking lit. It's definitely going to be one of the top WILD ass storylines with horriblepasts. It's WILD. If I were to say what I felt after reading the manga, it's going to give you hints on the ending. It's not expected.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters build up is going to be slow. The manga had 19 volumes and it slowly builds up the relationships between the characters.

            "content": "\u201cWhat is Banana Fish? I heard it\u2019s some Yaoi anime so I\u2019m not going to watch it\u201d\r\nThese are the type of comments I\u2019ve seen floating about in regards to Banana Fish. I wanted to address this first, because it\u2019s a huge misconception about what the show is about. In fact the closest thing to \u201cYaoi elements\u201d is the relationship between the two main leads. \r\nStory (10/10):\r\nIn a time when most shows nowadays are generic isekai light novel adaptations, or eechi harems with self-insert dense MC, filled with cliches and troupes- Banana Fish manages to be a compelling, gritty, complex story about gang warfare, drugs andthe mafia. There\u2019s no fanservice or silly harem here, hell there\u2019s barely any women in the show!\\n\\n\r\nThe story is set in the 1900s, about a rebellious gang leader named Ash Lynx, who wants to get revenge against Papa Dino Golzine (who happens to be the man who raised him and treated Ash as his sex toy) for having his older brother injected with a drug named Banana Fish, which through a circumstance of events results in his death. The story may sound simple, but there\u2019s a lot more plot threads and characters at work along with the mystery about what the Banana Fish is, that slowly build the story making it more complex.\\n\\n\r\nBanana Fish tackles dark and mature themes such as: drugs, violence, mafia, gang warfare, rape, child trafficking, pedohilla and corruption. However, it\u2019s not used to be \u201cedgy\u201d, but done in a subtle way without sugarcoating the brutality, to serve a narrative purpose in the story. Due to the realism and raw storytelling, there may be moments where one might find it uncomfortable to watch, so in other words, Banana Fish is not for the faint of heart.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (10/10):\\n\r\nThe characters are complex, well written, diverse and memorable. You have amazing side characters like Shorter Wong, Max, Sing, Yue Lung and his revenge arc against his brothers, to Eiji- who\u2019s depicted as a innocent, pure hearted retired athlete who knows nothing of the world of gang he\u2019s suddenly thrust into, but wants to stay by Ash\u2019s side. However, none of the characters are as carefully well crafted or developed as the main protagonist, Ash Lynx. Ash is honestly becoming one of my favourite characters of all time because of how complex and multi faceted he is. I love the dichotomy in his character from a beautiful, cold hearted, ruthless, competent, mature, gang leader & hacker- to this innocent, down to earth, kind hearted, 17 year old kid who\u2019s never had much of a childhood and has been dealing with years of insecurities and psychological trauma. Also, the parralels between Eiji and Ash are well written.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s some overreaching villains like Arthur and Dino who admittedly aren\u2019t   amazingly well written, but they\u2019re still good characters who are developing and give off a threatening vibe. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation (8/10): \\n\r\nCompared to it\u2019s manga counterpart, due to Studio MAPPA\u2019s storyboarding and beautiful dynamic animation, the anime is a thrilling experience to watch!\\n\\n\r\nSounds (10/10):\\n\r\nThe opening is amazing. I love the visuals and the fact that it doesn\u2019t spoil too much of the story. I listen to it everytime I watch an episode. The chorus especially is catchy and memorable \u201cInside my head, inside my head!!\u201d xD\\n\r\nThe osts are really good and the ending song is amazing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10):\\n\r\nI love Banana Fish. There\u2019s not been one episode where I felt was boring or thought was filler because of the well paced narrative. It saddens me to think of how many people skipped this anime because they heard about a Yaoi anime. Banana Fish is a underrated gem that deserves a much higher ranking on MAL.",

            "content": "The summer 18 anime season was very problematic as it was the season that was dominated by anime that contained 12/13 episodes and many of the anime unfortunately fell flat in the face either because there were either bad throwaway shows or they ended up getting crippled by the 12th/13th episode count where some of the show they had enough content of to make a 24/26 episode but set studio poor decisions making these show only ended up having the episode count that they ultimately got. This doesn't say that the summer 18 anime was a complete failure as it did give a couple ofgreat shows that I liked such as Chio's School Road, Revenue Starlight, Planet With and High Score Girl.\\n\\n\r\nAfter looking at the countless 12/13 episode animes that summer 18 season had to offer in the charts I saw two anime that had 24 episodes and these anime were Banana Fish and Mr Tonegawa: Middle Management Blues aka the Kaiji spinoff. I observed skipped the Kaiji spinoff from the time of this review because I have only seen a first 4 episodes of Kaiji and I wanted to watch the whole series first before going into this. So that leaves me with Banana Fish done by Studio Mappa. \\n\\n\r\nDespite me having a negative opinion of Mappa thanks to them making a bunch of shows (Not counting Yuri on Ice) that barely don't much substance to them aka Rage Of Bahamut Virgin Soul and Days I decided to give Banana Fish a shot just to see if they learned from the past mistakes that caused me to dislike them as a studio. Well after watching all 24 episodes of Banana Fish I can say yes Mappa has kinda learned a lesson from the past mistakes but at the same time I feel Mappa at times is still playing that style over substance card.\\n\\n\r\nThe story follows Ash Lynch a 17-year-old man has been adopted off the streets by the head of the New York mob papa Dino as a sex toy. However, after he comes across a man left for dead in an alley, he has added a necklace with a bullet attached to it which contains a secret white powder.\\n\\n\r\nAsh now has the ability to fight back against pana Dino and to possibly free himself from his grasps and this is all because what is in that bullet. While this was happening a journalist named Shunichi who come to document the gangs in New York City. He brings a cameraman assistant named Eiji to help him take pictures however he ends up getting caught in the confit between Dino and Ash and from there Ash journey towards freedom begins.\\n\\n\r\nI have mixed feelings for the story of Banana Fish as it has a lot of good things in it but at the same, it has quite a lot of meh things in it which I will talk about in the bit but first let's talk about the good things in Banana Fish's story.\\n\\n\r\nOn the surface, Banana Fish has a unique setting that is very different compared to most anime these days. Instead of being set in Japan Banana Fish is set in New York Urban style. Despite the show having a different overall setting, the series goes a solid job at establishing the New York setting as it fullest where see people doing gang/mafia activity left and right and we also see the people who are not part of the plot live they daily lives in peace. This aspect one of the stronger things in Banana Fish because it really makes the world feel alive as the viewers know that New York has a dark side where it's filled with gangs, mafia and druggies who do these dark acts that would have been illegal.\\n\\n\r\nThe one thing that I really liked of Banana Fish was how it was able to show the ugly side of humanity as it does showcased a lot of acts that only the worst of people would commit such as rape, human drug experiments, gang warfare, etc. On top of the shows, nice portrayal of showing the worst of humanity comes with the shows excellent theme exploration as the show explores themes of freedom, regret, betrayal and the show does a great job at respecting its core themes and topic s\\n\\n\r\nIf there was one thing that Banana Fish nails at its the emotional moments. This easily the most emotionally engaging anime from 2018 period because not only they are beautifully well executed but we see the characters break down into their worst state. The best example of this happens in the second half episode (Spoiler Ahead) After Eiji gets shot and sent to the hospital room we see Ash mentally broken.\\n\\n\r\nSome other great emotional moments when a character named Shorter gets drugged while Eiji couldn't do anything about it. What really made that scene even more sadder is that both Ash and Eiji cannot cure and as a result Ash had no choice to shot him to simply end Shorter pain and as a result of Ash mentally breaks down due to the fact that he couldn't save his one of his close friend from being drugged by the Banana Fish by Abraham.\\n\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, Banana Fish has problems. Lots of problems and many of these problems ended hurting the anime.\\n\r\nFor starters Banana Fish at various times feels like a style over substance flick as the show seems to highlight it's visuals over storytelling at times. To Banana Fish credits it's not as bad as something like Days or Virgin Soul but still, consider it a problem that ruins the overall writing quality in the show at times.\\n\r\nAnother problem with I had with Banana Fish that is pretty repetitive. \\n\\n\r\nIt was fine seeing Ash and Eiji getting kidnapped/arrested the first couple of times but after a while, it really got trying seeing one of these two characters getting kidnapped/arrested than later on getting rescued by set person. I understand that this kidnapped is meant to be part of the show theme of freedom but could they least not make happened every 2 to 4 episodes of Banana Fish.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem with Banana Fish is without the question is the pacing. While the first four episode of Banana Fish pacing wise was good and engaging but after that pacing moves a blazing speed where it was actually hard to tell what is going on in the narrative. I understand that the show trying to adapt a 19 volume manga into a 24 episode series but I feels the episode count for this series actually does more damage to the show then it helps especially when the show starts rushing/cutting out content in the second half of the series.\\n\\n\r\nNow I haven't read the manga from this time of this review as I decided to go full anime only mode but I easily tell that the show, especially in the second half, is rushed as hell. If this show had 39 episodes like Jojo Part 4 and 5 then this show would have been a better experience but as it stands the pacing in Banana Fish is a mess.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I found the story of Banana Fish to be above average. It did a quite a lot of good things in it but at the same time, Banana Fish has a lot of problems story-wise that prevent it from being a well-told story. I understand this show is mainly a character driven rather than a story driven but if your pacing is inconsistent like this then it's honestly hard for me to care about some characters which I will talk about now.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the story ended up being above average overall the characters least the main 2 protagonists completely make it where I can somewhat forgive the pacing issues of Banana Fish.\\n\\n\r\nFirst up we have Ash Lynx who is a former. Not gonna lie he is easily the best thing about Banana Fish. He is a very well written character who simply wants to be free from Dino's antics. His journey was very satisfying as we see him not only to find freedom by stopping Dino's plans but he also wants to protect Eiji from any harm caused by Dino and the villains. During his childhood years in Cape Cod, he was raped by his Little League coach, and the cops did do anything at all until Ash himself had to kill him with the gun.\\n\\n\r\nHe was eventually sent away from his father to live with his aunt however he soon gets captured by Golzine's man as soon got send to Club Cod as a child sex object. Why am I telling you all this you may ask? That's because Ash is literally a broken person who just wanted to live a normal life and every time Ash breaks down we can see his pain and suffering he has endured throughout his life and because of these reasons, Ash is great character and he's easily one of the best characters of 2018.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Eiji may not as memorable as Ash he still a pretty solid character. He's a polar opposite to Ash where he gets sucked into a mafia world being completely naive and clueless about the situations that Ash managed to drag himself into. Despite his naive attitude at first, he is willing to help Ash accomplished his goal of freedom from Dino and the rival gang.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters, on the other hand, were underdeveloped, and that's the sad part because the other characters in Banana Fish could have been great but the rapid pacing leaves them totally underdeveloped where you ultimately don't care for them. The best example of this was with Skip and Shorter. Outside of the introduction episodes, I couldn't care about them all that much because they didn't enough arrive screen time thanks to the rapid pacing. Shorter's death as much I enjoyed Ash perspective of that scene I couldn't care on Shorter perspective as the show failed to give him a decent spotlight.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the villains, I thought they were one dimensional and lacked any real depth whatsoever especially Dino who is a just a typical villain who likes experiment people with drugs. Even though the villains in Banana Fish lack any depth to speak off I feel like the show does a beautiful job at making the viewer loathe them so there that.\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals in Banana Fish is for the most part pretty good.\\n\r\nMAPPA did a good job with the character designs, background scenery for the setting of Banana Fish. The cinematography and use of urban colour palettes were very polished as it the show did a fantastic to bring key scenes from the 80s manga to live in anime in such brilliant ways. \\n\r\nThe animation is filled, consistent and nicely animated. Yes, it had a couple of shotty visuals cut moments episodes 13 in a nutshell but least it's not as bad as something like Goblin Slayer and Tokyo Ghoul re:\\n\\n\\n\r\nI may be the notoriety here, but I found the soundtrack of Banana Fish to be underwhelming. It's just a selection of generic mafia/gang that you all heard before in any action thriller anime. \\n\\n\r\nAll the opening and ending themes in the show were good, catchy and memorable in their own ways.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting in Banana Fish was outstanding. As a person who usually a dub only watcher, I was blown away of amazing and well acted the Seiyuu were. My favourite performance was hands down Yuuma Uchida. He did a wonderful portraying a broken lovable character Ash and it really makes the anime as the character struggles feel alive.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, Banana Fish from the time of this review hasn't got an English Dub and as a dub fan, this hurts because this show would be perfect for a semi-cast Funimation dub thanks to its American setting, themes and tone that is way different from the typical anime that is set in Japan. I hope this show gets a dub one day done by Bangzoom Entertainment and if it does get a dub I hope Johnny Yosh Bosch would voice Ash.\\n\\n\r\nAh, Banana Fish. You had so much potential to be one of the best animes of the year but the writing in the second half, the underdeveloped side chararters and the unhealthy blazing speed pacing ruined it. \\n\r\nLook Banana Fish is not a bad series but at the same time, I don't think it's all that great. It is a decent series that has a lot of good things in it like the character Ash, the themes and production values but everything else ranges from meh to pretty shallow. \\n\\n\r\nDespite it's problems, I still recommend Banana Fish to people who are looking for a fun action flick that has a strong main lead. \\n\r\nJust don't expect this to be one of the better animes from this decade because you will only end up being pretty disappointed as a result.",

            "content": "This is the first anime that make me create an account and write a review for it, because I want to recommend others that you should watch Banana Fish (BF). It is just incredible, from the animation, camera angle, action scene, plot, story, character design, soundtrack, everything is just awesome.\r\nThe story is very realistic. It talks about all bad sides of our world (rape culture, drug, pedophila, corruption) and also the comparison between America and Japan, where people allow to have gun and where people cannot have and also do not need a gun in their life, which is a powerful and meaningful base forthis anime. The plot is very connected and always bring you surprise. Every episode is very heavy, but mixed with some comedy and it make me love BF even more. \\n\\n\r\nNot like other anime, where everything happens slowly (a fight take for 1 or 2 episodes) or the pacing is very slow or the character reading their thought (it always drives me nuts), everything in Banana Fish is incredibly well-organized. The pacing is very accurate, give you enough time to feel and understand the situation (with beautiful music in the background) and not taking anything for a nonsense long time. Every dialogue is really connected to the story and also contain a profound meaning.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is magnificent. The first anime that every scene has a good human proportion with both face and body. People interaction looks very realistic, and people in the background are not just standing like a mannequin, they always doing something like a real person. It makes the anime looks more realistic. The background: New York city with many gorgeous graffiti on wall and a splendid liberty statue; china town which always crowded with people, restaurants and lanterns; the Cape Cod's nostalgic view in a windy field with beautiful dawn (it's a very sad scene); and especially the gorgeous Los Angeles city filled with night lights from the mountain's view. Many camera angle choices are very unique and clever, the animation crew did an awesome jobs on this anime.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack: its awesome, just listen and enjoy. My favorite is the ending song Prayer X by King Gnu, it gives me a nostalgic feeling mix of happiness and sadness (T.T). The opening clip is very beautiful with a fit music too.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoy Banana Fish more than I expected and have to read the manga because I can't wait a week for each episode (I regret for doing that, 'cause I know what will happen now T.T) Banana Fish has become my second favorite anime now, after Fullmetal Alchemist. It will become 1st place in my list if Mappa change the ending of the story. 10/10 for this anime and totally recommend other to give it a try <3  and remember to get your heart ready.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I don't usually write reviews, especially for anime but I really wanted to give my two cents on Banana Fish in the hope it might encourage someone to give this show the chance it deserves.\r\nAt its core, Banana Fish is an anime covering heavy topics like rape, drugs, gang violence and paedophilia which it shows with refreshing realism. There's no casually ignoring clearly pedophilic actions or  'uwu non-consensual yaoi', and nothing is used just for the shock value of seeing it on screen. Banana Fish treats these topics with the weight they deserve and doesn't sensationalise or normalise them like they often are inso many other anime. These topics do come up quite a lot, and I could see how one could argue that they are being used gratuitously (especially rape), but I believe it is handled well. There is no moment where the weight of what is happening is glossed over or ignored, especially by characters in the show (unless that desensitised view in itself is a part of a character). \\n\\n\r\nYes, Banana Fish does have gay characters, but it is definitely not what I'd consider a 'yaoi'. One of the reasons I avoid most yaoi anime (other than overdone and heteronormative tropes) is the sickening use of rape between the two love interests as a way to get fanservice into the show or to progress the relationship. Banana Fish shows rape and sexual assault as the disgusting, demeaning crime it is, instead of depicting it as a way to 'get the guy' so to speak. It's also so nice to see an anime that puts its plot and characters at the front and centre, instead of having the sexuality of the protagonist's fuel the entire show. So far Banana Fish has done a pretty great job of avoiding the issues that usually run rampant in anime with gay main characters and I'm really excited to see how they handle the budding friendship and (hopefully) relationship between Ash and Eiji. The groundwork has been laid for a genuinely well-written relationship and hopefully, they'll continue to impress me so I can add this to my list of anime with good gay representation.\\n\\n\r\nI was surprised how quickly I became invested in the main cast, and now after only six episodes, I can barely wait to see what trouble Ash and his little entourage get into next. Ash is an incredibly compelling protagonist with a complex tragic history and interesting set of morals, and Eiji is an excellent contrast to that without being a polar opposite. This dynamic is definitely something I'm looking forward to seeing the most. The supporting cast is also awesome, I especially love Shorter and his pink mohawk!\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is well developed and has some beautiful elements that help to set apart from many other styles that have been prevalent lately. This is especially noticeable in how the faces are animated. It really fits with the themes of the show and often helps to deliver, and at times further, the emotional impact of certain scenes. The sound used is equally good, and I often find myself turning up the OP when it plays despite being one of those terrible people who usually skip the opening... \\n\\n\r\nBanana Fish hasn't been perfect though (and I can't expect it to be). There have been a few slurs chucked around in the subs which I was quite surprised to see. It could be due to mistranslations etc. but it was still a bit jarring to see f*g used in the subs of an anime. \\n\\n\r\nTo sum this up, I'm impressed with how Banana Fish is handling the heavy subject matter it mentions without sensationalising it. The anime was definitely not created to pander to fujoshis, but instead aims to tell a plot and character driven story that includes gay characters/undertones. The characters are complex and interesting, and all of this is wonderfully complemented by the art and soundtrack. Overall I have high hopes for Banana Fish and am looking forward to the rest of the season!\\n",

            "content": "It is well known, even mentioned in the first two episodes, that Banana Fish borrows its odd name from a classic short story written by JD Salinger called \u201cA Perfect Day for Banana Fish.\u201d What is somewhat less noted, however, is how perfectly this reference captures the theme and style of the manga and anime series. Salinger\u2019s story tells of the suicide of Seymour Glass, a World War II vet. The most famous passage of the story features a young man telling a young girl of the \u201cvery tragic life\u201d of the Bananafish species who enter a \u201cbanana hole\u201d as \u201cvery-ordinary looking fish\u201d and gorgethemselves on bananas until they are unable to escape and die.\u201d In many ways, the life of these fictional fish mirrors the life of the main protagonist in the anime, Ash Lynx. One critic of Salinger (Janet Malcolm of the New Yorker) has noted that Salinger depicts life \u201cas a battleground between the normal and abnormal, the ordinary and the extraordinary, the talentless and the gifted, the well and the sick.\u201d This, too, is a very apt description of the picture we get of the dark world in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nBanana Fish tells the story of Ash, a brilliant 17-year-old boy. Ash was raped at a young age, ran away from home and taken in by the mafia as a sex slave, worked is way up in the organization after winning the favor of the mafia boss (and main antagonist, Dino Goldzine), and is currently a gang leader in New York. As might be expected of anyone with such a tragic background, Ash is extremely mentally unhealthy, verging into becoming a full-fledged sociopath just like his abusers. Into his life comes Eiji, a rather normal yet caring Japanese photographer traveling with a journalist documenting gang life in America. Here we immediately see the contrast between normal and abnormal, well and sick, and talentless and gifted, and how this contrast might hopefully be resolved in Ash and Eiji\u2019s relationship. Yet Banana Fish is also about a riveting mystery around what \u201cbanana fish\u201d\u2014not the fictional species of Salinger\u2014is, its connections to a massive plot involving the military, and the development character of a large cast of interesting, well-developed gangsters who act as fantastic foils to Ash (particularly a Chinese mob master named Yut-Lung).\\n\\n\r\nThe basic concept of the plot is intriguing, engrossing, and thematically dense. It plays in morally gray areas beyond good and evil, capturing some rather Nietzschean themes about the healthiness or unhealthiness of basic morality. Do \u201cnormal\u201d moral constraints merely domesticate prodigious nobles like Ash or helps humanize such people and making them truly happy? Ultimately, Banana Fish takes the side of the latter. It further explores extremely dark psychological dimensions of post-traumatic stress disorder, graphic depictions of sexual assault and violence, manipulation, and psychological torture. Be warned, this is not a series for the faint of heart. Yet it consistently gives room for characters to realistically react to these events, and console each other through the darkest of moments (this becomes the cornerstone of Ash and Eiji\u2019s relationship).\\n\\n\r\nIs the execution of this concept, adapted from Akimi Yoshoda\u2019s classic, critically acclaimed 1985-94 manga series, any good though? I have not read the manga so cannot comment on its status as an adaptation. However, I can say that it largely stands up on its own merits. Some have raised concerns about MAPPA\u2019s decision to put the series in modern era rather than its original setting in the late-80s. I agree it probably would have been stronger in its original time. There are moments where some events strain credulity in a modern setting. The whole notion of a gang scene this active and violent in New York makes sense in the 80s in a way it no longer does, some of the projects the military engaged in so central to the plot were more fitting in the Cold War than the modern context, the lack of professional female characters in even in the background (eg., doctors, police, etc.) is somewhat odd in 2018, and a lot of the political commentary is more suited to 1980s America than modern day. Overall, there is very little distinctive about the story that demands a modern setting. However, these are rather minor gripes and if we can suspend our disbelief for so many plot-hole ridden absurd fantastical shounen anime, a little anachronism and is completely forgivable.\\n\\n\r\nAnother somewhat valid complaint is the unbelievably high concentration of homosexual/bisexual male characters, or at least those who are willing to engage in sexual acts with other men. Sometimes, it is unclear whether the characters want to have sex for erotic reasons or are simply using sexual abuse with other males as a method of control and power (as is usually the case with sexual abuse), and this particularly is the case with Goldzine and Foxx. In these cases, it is forgivable, and clearly having Ash and Eiji show such tendencies was rather necessary. Yet there are moments where I cannot help but agree with this criticism, such as a rather unnecessary scene where Ash successfully (and comically) seduces a random security guard so he can steal his gun and escape. But again, for the era when the manga was written an overrepresentation of homosexual content was hardly a pressing problem. Further, the fact that a prominent anime is finally exploring homosexual themes while not engaging in a rape fetish like most garbage-tier yaoi, but instead critically presents sexual abuse as traumatic is to be celebrated.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the main plot, Banana Fish ambitiously packs a huge amount of content into its 24-episode run, launching right into the action in the very first episode. At moments it feels slightly rushed (especially the last two episodes). Further, there are scenes, background stories, and subplots I wish the series could have had time to explore in far more dept hand detail\u2014such as Ash\u2019s childhood, Ling\u2019s backstory, or the culture shock Eiji must have had on a road trip across America.  It also is somewhat wanting of a better explanation of what Eiji is even doing here. \\n\\n\r\nDespite this, it largely is remarkably well-paced for such a short though ambitious project. After some of the most disturbing, action-packed, and climatic scenes, it will go into almost slice-of-life style episodes where little happens that allow for character development on a level rarely attained in such action-heavy crime dramas. So much of this series suggestively shows the development of relationships and dynamic character changes(especially the budding romance between Ash and Eiji) in a subdued manner rather than telling you what\u2019s happening very bluntly and directly. These episodes are a welcome break and its development of the main characters in these episodes and scene are where it truly shines.\\n\\n\r\nThis is not to say, though, the main action-packed scenes are not good. They are fantastically directed, some of the best-looking fight scenes that could be hoped for. Some may find the events somewhat cyclical and repetitive, jumping from one kidnapping and escape sequence to another. For one, this is somewhat of a simplification of the events, and more importantly, each climatic sequence is sufficiently different to retain interest. If we can make it through most repetitive, drawn-out, and trope-dependent shounen fight scene arcs, this is amazing by comparison. \\n\\n\r\nThere are some relatively minor flaws in its writing. Most notably, a few backstories of key characters introduced later in the series are explained in a somewhat rushed manner. I would have preferred this series be about ten or so episodes longer to more thoroughly develop these characters. However, it certainly got the job done adequately. Another problem is the dialogue is sometimes clunky and awkward. At times, this is due to obvious translation errors in the subtitles (the translation of \u201cfag\u201d in the first episode is obviously inaccurate and off-putting even as someone who does not speak Japanese, and \u201cI will kill whomever hurt you\u201d is not a grammatical sentence). Other times, it is clearly the fault of the writers and just corny\u2014such as the end of a key scene where an antagonist maniacally laughs in a cartoonish manner in episode ten. There are also moments where ill-fated attempts at humor are awkwardly thrown into otherwise serious and dark scenes. Yet, overall, the writing is heartfelt and believable, and these minor slip ups can be forgiven.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation and directing, it is rare to see such a feast for the eyes outside of carefully crafted films by an elite few directors. There are scenes that took my breath away with how well they were executed in terms of cinematography. Zooming in on details in the background that were previously only subtly gestured towards for profound emotional effect, interesting perspectives taken in unpredictable though fitting ways, and extremely disturbing and violent scenes where little gore is shown but audio cues and off-focus camera angles let the imagination run wild all contribute to a powerful, raw, and artistic visual experience. There was fantastic attention to detail down to the labels of whiskey bottles.\\n\\n\r\nThe largest success in terms of animation are the character designs and especially the movement and expressions of some of the main characters. Just watch the second intro (featuring \u201cFreedom\u201d by Blue Encount) on YouTube, which starts with a captivating image of Ash\u2019s pupil\u2019s dilating, to see just how successful this series is in this respect. This is not to say the animation is perfect, there were a few incongruous moments of mediocre CGI implementation in the first two episodes (see, for an example, the Statue of Liberty shot in episode 1). However, even these were barely noticeable, and the animation improved noticeably as the series went along.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is as versatile as it is suitable. It mostly accompanies in a subdued manner and even remained silent in all the right places. It mixes dissonant piano melodies, jazzy hip-hop beats, and dark choral pieces into a rich audio tapestry. I did not notice it while watching it on a weekly basis, yet when I binged through the whole series in one sitting the day of the premiere of the finale it became clear that soundtrack is good. Further, the vocal performances by most of the voice actors, particularly Yuuma Uchida's portrayal of Ash, are pretty stellar. Even the choices for intro and outro songs, often integrated into key scenes, are amazing and completely fitting in both tone and lyrics.\\n\\n\r\nI do not believe that I have ever personally held a series in such an overwhelmingly positive regard that seems to be largely receiving, at best, mixed or tepid reviews (at least relative to my estimation). Perhaps it\u2019s because I approached it with such low expectations. I was expecting another mediocre shoujo/shounen-ai with half-baked crime elements but was stunned by the dark and rich world into which it immersed me. I watched each episode as it came out and was shocked by how much I liked it, then I decided to binge the whole thing in one sitting to see if really lived up to the hype I was giving it and decided it did. This truly is a series that defies any genre or box you could try to put it into. I've seen it categorized as everything from Seinen, to crime drama, to adventure, to Shounen-ai, to Shoujo. Perhaps its all of these, but really feels quite beyond all of them. \\n\\n\r\nMaybe I\u2019m just overreacting to its personally relevant and impactful twist ending (which, without spoiling anything, was one of the biggest and most surprising emotional gut-punches I\u2019ve ever experienced). Maybe I\u2019m just overly excited I finally found an anime with a fantastically developed homoromantic relationship. Maybe I just read too much philosophical content into it. Regardless, I can\u2019t help but completely love this series and give it only the second perfect 10 I have ever given, despite its admitted flaws. Perhaps I will downgrade my estimation of it after some reflection. For now, though, sits second on my favorite list only behind Brotherhood.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nEnjoyability: 10/10\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n",

Unfortunately, it falls into those boring anime tropes that really ruin the interesting story they had going on.\r\nI didn't have a problem with how most of the characters in the show are either gay or extremely progressive in their views on homosexuality, but they take it so far so that every single character Ash meets has to say how '\"pretty\" or attractive he is, even these tough mobsters and gang leaders and the straight married adults inthe show. That was pretty weird. Where the show started failing for me was when the main characters friend ( or love interest, they really leave that question wide open) starts getting upset that he kills people all the time, despite knowing he was a gang leader and WATCHING HIM KILL PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE SHOW. Then when Ash starts questioning the kind of person he is for killing all these people, despite having been doing it in gangs for the entire second half of his life. He has been running a gang for years, he kills people almost every episode, I have no idea where this guilty conscience suddenly came from. Then when they start making it look like he's some sort of genius with elite hacker skills, it all falls apart. This guy has been a male prostitute and sex slave since he was like 11, it seems like he never even went to middle school and grew up in this rural town with nothing in it until he was kidnapped by a mob lord. Where did he learn how to \"hack a computer\", much less funnel 90 million dollars from foreign bank accounts by selling fake stocks and then immediately purchase a massive condo in New York with cash? Well they never explain any of that, and considering the realism they put in so many other parts of the show it's really strange how easily that went about. Then in the later episodes he just hides in plain site with glasses on like he's Clark Kent and nobody ever catches him, which is total bullshit. I just don't get why they started pushing this bogus \"genius\" persona for him, when he was just a badass mobster with good people skills up to this point. It just became a cliche and it was really hard to keep the same level of interest when they started throwing out all these lame plot devices in the middle of the season.\\n\\n\r\nTLDR; It was good until Ash suddenly becomes an elite hacker genius who randomly gets a guilty conscious after killing people his entire life, therefore seeming more like a little bitch and less like the badass he was made out to be in the first several episodes. He gets less and less likable every episode while every character in the show seems to think he's the hottest genius on earth.",

            "content": "So I rewatched this anime a second time. All 24 episodes. Not out of desperate need or desperate desire to rewatch, but to accurately rate this material for myself and for you, since I forgot things and the momentum was broken, since I watched while it was airing and saw episodes inconsistently.\r\nIt\u2019s honestly very difficult to classify this show. It\u2019s about gangs, but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s about drugs, but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s about survival, but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s about love, but it\u2019s not. Willing to sacrifice everything, but at the same time not budging to compromise who you are and why you fight no matterwhat.\\n\\n\r\nBanana fish very accurately depicts and reflects truths about corruption within political systems: Politicians that sell-out, human experimentation, drug distribution, child sex trafficking circles, under-the-table deals with mafia leaders, military contracts, etc. Very real issues are portrayed, and Banana Fish does not hold back in regards to showing the viewer how horrendous human beings can truly be.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough it is easy to become infatuated with this work by many means (the artwork, the music, the story, the bl, or just Ash Lynx and his dynamic character), it is important to know that this is a unique story, and many people will go into it with expectations that will let them down. If you\u2019re expecting an anime with 30 simultaneous and convoluted storylines like HxH 2011, then this won\u2019t live up to that expectation. If you\u2019re here simply for what you heard may be shounen-ai, you will probably be disappointed. The story is much more than any potentially showcased relationships.\\n\\n\r\nIf you ask people what Banana Fish is about, you will most likely get very long answers. The story itself isn\u2019t hard to follow, but there are many aspects to it: drugs, politics, rape, freedom, power, violence, gangs, friendship, revenge, and all of these play key roles in the overall story.\\n\\n\r\nIn essence, Banana Fish is the story about a boy who constantly endures tragic and unfortunate events wherever he goes. A boy who doesn\u2019t let his past dictate who he is. A boy who wants to love the world, but is not allowed to lower his defenses. A boy who is willing to sacrifice everything he has achieved to protect his friends. Who goes against the grain every step of the way, yet manages to remain humble. A boy who obtains power by his own incredible wit, charm, and strength. For revenge? Ambition? Justice? Freedom? For love? You tell me, but would you sacrifice your life in hopes that someone like this boy would let go of their baggage and begin to live a life they can be proud of? How would it feel if at any moment that person could disappear right before your eyes, and you are powerless to do anything about it? This is the story of Banana Fish.\\n\\n\r\nI really do admire this animation for how effectively it illustrates human emotion and conflict. Despite the awesomeness of this show, there are a few things that could\u2019ve been done a tad better. I have heard people say that plot points in the story became repetitive in regards to certain situations, and in a sense that is true, but after watching it a second time (with a better grip of how/why things happen in the show), I\u2019ve realized that the progression of the story is so real. It is pretty impressive the amount of material that was packed into 24 episodes, and while there wasn\u2019t a huge amount of room for character development for every single main character, the main cast did have depth, and they had great interactions with each other, and the second time around those \u2018repetitive\u2019 situations really didn\u2019t seem repetitive at all. Yes there are characters that made arguably thoughtless decisions as they were written to, but there was plausibility and reason in every choice made, and the story was carefully crafted over three decades ago to arrive where it did.\\n\\n\r\nWhat really did it for me were the great shootouts and fight scenes, coupled with the emotional scenes that complimented them, the lovely soundtracks that carried certain scenes and that stuck with me afterwards, both OP\u2019s and ED\u2019s (especially the first ED), the progression of the main characters and their relationship, and to the total disagreement of many, how the antagonists were handled.",

            "content": "I've never written a review before, my apologies.\r\nThis anime had me hooked at the first episode. From the brilliant animation and impeccably detailed illustrated environments, to the fast paced- but not rushed- plot line. The episodes hardly left you on a frustrating cliffhanger, but i was always left wanting more. I'd always find myself asking questions every Thursday in the episode's wake, like \"How big of an issue does Banana Fish actually get? Will Ash really be able to protect Eiji and manage to watch his back simultaneously?\" I couldn't keep my mind off it.\r\nHOWEVER, as you've probably figured out, this anime fits into thecategory of a TRAGEDY. And it follows that to a T. You'll probably walk away from this series feeling heartbroken.\\n\\n\r\nTaking a step back and observing the subtle elements that brought more color to the story, I found that the scattered references to American literature were the ones that stood out to me the most. From minute comparisons to Salinger's Catcher in the Rye, to Ash's whole life being a tragic parallel to Hemingway's Snows of Kilimanjaro. It brought so much depth- you could almost believe BFish was a true story.\\n\\n\r\nAnd on the subject of the characters, they felt just as real. There are a plethora of interactions which you'd expect to see in real life. There's Ash's right hand man, Eiji Okumura, who is comfortingly benign versus Dino Golzine who caused almost all of Ash's problems. They really broaden the spectrum of personalities seen within the story. Even so, they were not without their flaws. Every single character against Ash is shown to be homosexual, and it disrupted the believable flow the show seems to be so good at.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the soundtrack, it is easy to overlook, but if you pay attention it is actually very well done and contributes a lot to the mood of every scene. I was so excited when Ash was walking down that alley in the beginning of the first episode, even though nothing was really happening (at first). Some of the ones that stuck with me were #1 BANANA FISH, #21 TEARS OF THE LYNX, #30 HIM AND HYM, and #44 PRAYER. The openings and endings have somewhat applicable lyrics, the first two songs are great.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally, the ending. Personally, I found the last episode to be very rushed plot-wise, and that made it difficult to really empathize or feel the grief/joy that I was anxiously anticipating as opposed to the the manga which really drew it out. That being said, the last episode is what leaves the last, and most important impression. The series as a whole is gorgeous and high quality, but it was hard to remember that. But don't get me wrong- the last episode wasn't bad. In fact, I had tears in my eyes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is an absolutely fantastic anime. It explores LGBT themes without being the focus of the story or blatantly pandering to an audience. The majority of events happen at a satisfying pace with appropriate placement of soundtrack, and characters that you can become easily attached to. It doesn't skirt around the grotesque themes like rape and human trafficking, but won't show the disturbing unnecessary details that can be derived from situational context/ hinting. There are so many nuanced situations and that's why I love it. It makes you think AND feel. It just doesn't classify as a shoujo/BL, it's so much more than that and you'll hear this from almost anyone who's watched Banana Fish.",

At the same time, many conspiracy and mastermind surrounding him.\\n\r\nHe wonder if he can change thrust into the harsh reality? Can He lead brilliant future? Or he will fall down there...\\n\\n\r\nSetting is America. Protagonist of this show is Ash Lynx. He is a boss of gang. He got his hands dirty, and he move up current capacity.\\n\r\nCriminal act named underworld happen frequently. Ash is living among them. His power and his buddies are dependable.\\n\r\nEspecially Shorter is irreplaceable existence for Ash. And Eiji Okumura came from Japan for some reason.\\n\r\nAsh and Eiji come to considerate each other carefully. Ash's true feeling is terminate this conflict as soon as possible.\\n\r\nAnd he want to pass peaceful and happy days with his buddies. I think it is desirable thing for Ash.\\n\r\nBut atrocious villains including Golzine disturb Ash. So Ash will taste same bitterness over and over again, take punishment close to torture.\\n\r\nNevertheless, Ash never give up. Because of he has firm faith. He kills emenies in front of his eyes without hesitation. It is task and fate of strong man.\\n\\n\r\nNotable Advantages are well made characters, world-view. This show is depicting clearly combined with beautiful art and animation by MAPPA.\\n\r\nAsh is basically cool and clearheaded character. He can accept human who he recognized. He has generosity. Anyways, he is attractive.\\n\r\nEiji is meddlesome and tender-hearted boy. He is conscious of Ash as his friend and buddy. I have good feeling of him.\\n\r\nOtherwise, Lee Yut Lung appear in later episodes. He also charming. His cunning makes me scary. He is really dangerous.\\n\r\nPersonally, I like Sing Soo-Ling, too. His voice and looking are my type. He is vigorously young man in good meaning.\\n\\n\r\nI don't read manga though, I understand Akimi Yoshida's unique essence and storytelling. These annex this show exquisitely.\\n\r\nClever and coherent dialogues, go above and beyond, many thrilling scenes. There is variety as if it weren't already enough. Keep us from being bored.\\n\r\nSolid style what unbefitting shoujo genre is this show's symbol. Probound scenes between everywhere and soft design are truly excellent. I feel shoujo there.\\n\r\nElocution also dopeness like Crime film. It is modern version of The Godfather. If you like Mafia drama, you're into this show.\\n\r\nAs proportion, male characters are so many. Female characters are overwhelming little. Opinions are divided. But I like it.\\n\\n\r\nOP and ED songs are surprisingly wonderful. 1-cour OP makes us hunch divination about spectacular story, ED is depicting Ash's trouble politely. 2-cour also same.\\n\r\nThis show is first TV anime's tie-up of Survive Said The Prophet. Lyrics and Melody are fitting this show perfectly. And so cool.\\n\r\nI became of this band fan by this show. My favorite music genres are Rock and Metal. So my compatibility with them is suit.\\n\r\nThanks to this show, I also became fan of King Gnu. Tune that I wouldn't think mixture is admirable.\\n\r\nVoice acting is perfect, and fitting each characters. Especially Ash! It goes without saying that his attraction is further increased.\\n\\n\r\nFlaw is only this. Raw and such as heart is painful scenes are so many. It cannot be helped. But these certainly sore.\\n\\n\r\nHuman has salvation even if fall in a dilemma invariably. Anime what It feels even more like that is Banana Fish.\\n\r\nThis show is absolutely not for everyone. Far distant position. That's why this show is so realistic.\\n\r\nHowever, I recommend more many people. The reason is that this show is not only interesting, I want you to know familiar important people's value again.\\n\r\nI'm jealous for Ash and Eiji. Their relationship is very similar to me and my elder brother. So I empathize this show.\\n\r\nThis show is close to masterpiece. I think this show is quite underrated. Awesome show.",

The fast-paced actions scenes coupled with the well thought out actions of the characters (albeit gruesome) create an absolutely thrilling experience. \r\nCharacters:\r\nThe contrasting natures of the two main characters are enthralling.

In addition to this, I would like to point out the effort that has gone intothe intriguing backgrounds of the MC's. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art fits well with the story and does a fantastic job of properly portraying the characters.\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nAdmittedly, I'm one of those people who just skip the beginning, so I'll leave up to you to form your own opinion about this. \\n\\n\r\nOveral Enjoyment:\\n\r\nAlthough I typically watch animes more on the line of The Irregular at Magic Highschool and was very reluctant to watch Banana Fish.

            "content": "At the age of 8, after his notorious debut role in the critically acclaimed cult show, Boku no Pico, Ash \"Pico\" Callenreese ran away from his home in Cape Cod to escape social pressures and was taken into the custody of Papa Dino (or simply, Papa), the leader of the Corsican Mafia, to become its future leader. Turns out Ash does not wish this to happen, but Papa like really wants, so naturally we now have a series about 2 gay mafiosos running after each others because neither of them wants to change their opinion. One could even go as far as declare they aren'tthinking very straight.\\n\\n\r\nI read Banana Fish manga 7 years ago and didn't like it very much. After seeing the anime getting produced by MAPPA (which I adore), I assumed/hoped the anime adaptation could do better job dealing with the drama, action and even character design - which were all pretty problematic with its shojo art style and female target audience which seemed to be quite limited to fujoshi pandering. I am saying this as a guy who has read over 400 shojo manga, and in generally appreciates works aimed for the demographic. The anime is already better, but it didn't fix its characters or story. \\n\\n\r\nMy biggest problem are the characters - who, on the other hand, are driving the narrative - which means the story is also problematic because the characters are. For some reason, whenever there is a criminal warlord -- who has removed themselves from the shackles of modern society, created their very own world and hierarchy similar to the one they escaped themselves -- the same person wants to push their own shit and agenda onto others. \"Don't do like I do, do like I say.\" Papa is not manly man nor a bro dude. He is an asshole with terribad double standards, who thinks he knows better what others should do. I rarely appreciate control freaks and narratives that are driven by some baddie acting like a freaking plot element. But that's exactly how Banana Fish works. Ash and Eiji - AKA the runaway gay couple - are not much better. Ash acts like a brat, and Eiji is more obviously gay than any other character.\\n\\n\r\nThe writing mainly reminds me of a show 2 cours back called Citrus. Series where every character was a lesbo and the lesbian was shoveled down the viewers throat. Banana Fish is practically the male version of that show. Everyone is gay, looks gay or at least talks about gay people. Ash calls one dude a faggot for watching homo porn... where Ash himself is the porn star. Good comedy, I guess. Every time we meet a new character who knows Dino, he casually mentions \"btw, that dude is gay.\" If there ever is a character who doesn't announce they either enjoy shotas, manly buttholes, or are in a gay relationship, you can safely assume that they are at least checking 2 of the 3 mentioned because apparently, executing a show about gay people is best done in a manner similar to ecchi series which promote being hetero with boob fondling, pantsu shots and nose bleeding. \\n\\n\r\nThe actual events are a collection of cliches from kidnapping incidents to mexican standoffs. And of course, every Ash's \"assassination\" plan fails because none of the million people who attack him brought any guns. Baseball bats and random pipes are just that more efficient in a fight where the opposing party uses a fucking magnum. But don't worry! It's all just part of the bigger plan. Whenever anything happens, you know it is just an excuse for the story to go in the direction the author prefers. This is beyond visible and obvious in the series. Oh, and how are the kidnap incidents overcome, you ask? Simply by one of the characters announcing how one of the kidnappers is gay, followed by Ash trolling them with his cuteboy butt, and voila! the day has been saved once again. \\n\\n\r\nThe worst part of the production itself is that these are the production values to this anime, when they could be the values to something that is good. Go watch Gungrave, 91 Days (pronounced 91 Gays), Rainbow Nisha, Gangsta, Speed Grapher, Kekkai Sensen, or even Dogs instead. Come back to this one only if none of those pleased the manly mobster love in you, and even then, be prepared for some extra nonsense.",

            "content": "[Updated after episode 9] Since starting to watch this show I've quickly learned why Banana Fish's manga is one of the most well recieved and impactful manga of all time in Japan; Banana Fish's animated adaptation is rapidly shaping up to become one of my all time favourite anime. \r\n-Story- \r\nEssentially the plot is that Ash Lynx, a 17 year old gang leader and abuse survivor, is caught up in the fallout over a thing or entity named \"Banana Fish\", linked to his brother Griffin and the war in Iraq. Ash's boss and abuser Dino wants the drug back. Meanwhile 19 year old Eiji fromJapan arrives as a photojournalist covering New York's gangs, but gets caught up in the conflict. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot, while certainly reliant on genre tropes, makes for an excellent thriller. There's never a dull moment in any of the episodes, aided by a smart and fast adaptation of the manga. Not an episode goes by without a few major developments and plot twist or three. Intelligently, the series doesn't focus *too* much on the mystery of what \"Banana Fish\" is, with plenty of other plot developments going on aswell. Don't worry though, there are fairly quick answers as to the truth about \"Banana Fish\", and it's turning out to be more interesting for the plot than you think seem at first. \\n\\n\r\nWhile not grimdark, Banana Fish isn't a happy series - there's mentions and (non-explicit) depictions of eg child abuse, violence, and sexual assault, though it's balanced out by some typically shojo sweet or funny moments. The subject is approached with respect and isn't sensationalised or sexualised for the viewer. Rape and child abuse is depicted as an being about an abuse of power rather than sex, and is always told from the point of the view of the victim traumatised by what they went through. The show also discusses topics such as victim-blaming and disbelief of people's experiences, especially from sources of authority including government and the police - issues that continue to be as relevant today as the 1980s when the manga was written. \\n\\n\r\n-Characters-\\n\\n\r\nWhile the plot is intriguing, BF's key strength is in its' characters and the emotional impact the plot's twist and turns have on both them and we as the viewers. The cast is interesting and fresh all round, with almost every character being very likeable (or hateable for the villains) and memorable. The characters and their struggles are the beating core of this series. Honestly, I've rarely felt as emotionally invested in an anime; Banana Fish succeeds in getting you to care deeply about the characters before putting them into horrific situations - contributing to the strong emotional impact of the recent episodes. \\n\\n\r\nAsh is becoming one of my favourite anime characters ever. He's overcame great adversity, but doesn't treat himself as a victim. He's sassy and confident in getting back at his numerous attempted rapists and abusers, and always resourceful in taking down his enemies. You''ll root for him as he sets out to take revenge on the men - especially Dino - who've ruined his life. No only that, but he's actually really smart and well read which goes against stereotypes for this kind of character. \\n\\n\r\nEiji is pretty much the polar opposite to Ash, being naive about and unaccustomed to the world of the mafia. He seems shy though lovable at first, but in ep 2 and 3 we see that he's a lot braver than we thought. He's already really committed to helping out Ash. Honestly you'll grow to love him pretty quickly, he's likely to be the most relatable character for most viewers. \\n\\n\r\nShorter has swiftly become a fan favourite, winning from many the accolade of best boy. He's a good counterpart and friend to both Ash and Eiji, being a fun character to watch but also quick to come to the rescue of the protags when they need it. He definitely comes across much better than the manga, with his updated design - now keeping that mohawk - and more expressive animations. \\n\\n\r\nYut Lung is introduced a bit later so I don't go into as much detail about him, but he's an interesting mirror image to Ash, and a strong presence on screen helped by his VA Fukuyama Jun. \\n\\n\r\nBF succeeds in making you really hate its villains. Dino is a mafia boss and a dirty old man - but there seems to be something deeper below the surface in his relationship with Ash. One of his underlings, Arthur, \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n-LGBT representation- \\n\\n\r\nBanana Fish is famous for being one of the formative works in the BL genre and has a good number of LGBT fans. If anyone is misled by the \"Yaoi\" tags this series has on some sites, there is nothing sexual in the relationship, it is purely platonic. That doesn't make it less valid though.  Many viewers will appreciate the depiction of an close non-sexual platonic relationship between two men. \\n\\n\r\nAt the moment its only a third of the way through the show's runtime, but I'm assured by manga readers Ash and Eiji's relationship is going to get much deeper and more emotional as things go on. But already, the groundwork for their relationship has been set, and the anime is notably putting more emphasis on their relationship than the manga did up to this point. \\n\\n\\n\r\n-Art- \\n\\n\r\n BF is a very solid outing from studio MAPPA, aided by the visual storytelling skill of Free!'s season 1 and 2 director. The designs have been updated a bit for animation but are still recognisably 80s, a nice change of pace from the usual modern art style. Ash doesn't look as good as his manga counterpart, but Eiji, Shorter and other characters look better or about the same as they did in the manga. The animation does good work in depicting the characters, their expressions, body language and movements, etc., as well as the show's frenetic action scenes.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat I especially love is the use of different colour palates and background art. It really adds to the world and tone BF is aiming for and makes for a lot of visually interesting scenes. The anime is really building on the manga's artwork in many places which is great to see. There's so much personality and care put into the character's expressions and body language which brings the show's cast ti life. \\n\\n\r\nOverall BF is a pleasant treat for the eyes, and the visuals complement the emotional goals of the show very well. \\n\\n\r\n-Sound-\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting is excellent. Especially love Ash's VA, he fits the role very well, but everyone is in good form here. In particular the voice acting carries the more emotional and stressful parts of the story (like the most recent episode) brilliantly. \\n\\n\r\nOP and ED are excellent. The OP is one of the best of the year so far. The OST is also one of the best in recent anime, a lot of these tracks would be good to listen to on their own. The OST really fits the tone of each scene and adds a lot on top of the animation and voicework. \\n\\n\r\n-Conclusion-\\n\\n\r\nBanana Fish is flying under the radar at this point, but it doesn't deserve to. It's an easy frontrunner for AOTY so far, and I wholeheartedly recommend it if what you've read pique your interest. \\n",

            "content": "If there\u2019s one thing that\u2019s enticing about the Noitamina network, it\u2019s their way of broadcasting shows to a variety of audiences. Banana Fish seems like one of those shows that isn\u2019t aimed at a wider audience but it definitely has its own appeal. Taking place in a crime-noir setting, the series deals with teenage gangs in a corrupted city. It\u2019s a time period of recreation and Banana Fish sets a firm example of an old school crime drama resurrected to modern life.\r\nNow I have to admit, I\u2019m not too familiar with Akimi Yoshida\u2019s work or her style of writing. The only other series I\u2019ve readby her is a manga called \u201cYasha\u201d. It has no relation to this series but the artwork is distinctive with her work. Not to mention, her series evokes a sense of mystery that\u2019s present in Banana Fish. Yet, just what exactly is Banana Fish?\\n\\n\r\nTo be clear, the original manga was published from 1985 to 1994. This adaptation serves as a celebration of her 40th anniversary. It\u2019s also somewhat unusual that Noitamina adapted this into 24 episodes rather than their usual 11/22 format. Regardless, Banana Fish strikes to me as a refreshing experience. First impressions are important and this show accomplishes that with the aesthetic story setting. It shows New York in a crime driven state and conflicts dealing with mature content. It's also interesting to note that the series has a more modern feel compared to the 1980s. And that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg.\\n\\n\r\nA main appealing factor that drew me into the show is the character relationship and development. We meet Ash Lynx, a snarky young man who ran away from home. Despite his not-so-friendly attitude, Ash has charisma that makes him a person not to be underestimated. He also possesses a variety of skills that puts him on the wrong sides of the law. Being incredibly daring and never afraid to take risks, Ash stands by example as a daredevil. It\u2019s almost if he anticipates his death at any moment and isn\u2019t afraid to risk it for what he believes in. This puts him on the opposite side of Eiji Okumura, a photographer\u2019s assistant and college student. Unlike Ash, Eiji is a kind young man but often easily manipulated or gets caught into complicated circumstances. The story goes to show his character relationship with Ash. Now I\u2019m just going to throw it out there but there\u2019s heavy implication of BL context between the two. While not being too explicit, it\u2019s shown that Eiji develops a growing love towards Ash. On the other hand, Ash shows his own devotion with action that speaks louder than words. Ash\u2019s acts of self-sacrifice becomes a central part of their relationship as he takes on many risks to save his life. The story often involves with Ash\u2019s enemies exploiting his weakness and that would be Eiji. \\n\\n\r\nStill, the million dollar question remains. What exactly is Banana Fish? To be clear, the title itself isn\u2019t necessarily just about what Banana Fish really is. Rather, it\u2019s a pivotal component of the plot that has Ash investigate into. In essence, Banana Fish delivers a sensation of mystery and suspense. The main premise focuses on how Ash\u2019s fight against the mafia in this rebellious age. Crime lords like Dino Glozine is the stereotypical antagonist you\u2019ll quickly love to hate. I don\u2019t mean that in the sense of him being a distasteful human being. Rather, Ash has a personal agenda to settle with him considering their dark history together. The series isn\u2019t shy to deliver mature context in the form of drug deals, criminal activities, sex slavery, or gang wars. If you\u2019re here to stay for the show, then be ready suck it up and indulge on these controversial topics. In the meantime, we also meet allies that Ash meets in his quest of vengeance. Characters such as Ibe, Max, Griffin, Alexis, and Jessica join to fight the good fight. In many cases, their roles all are important for the overall mission. On the other hand, their most prominent adversary is Corsican Mafia consisting of Dino and his crew. Deep down, this anime crafts these antagonists with intentions to destroy Ash\u2019s life. It becomes a crime thriller that often tests the limits of the main characters and how much longer they can last. Later in the show, we also meet other dangerous groups such as the Chinese mafia. Among their members includes the cunning Yut-Lung Lee who wants Ash\u2019s head on a plate.\\n\\n\r\nAt its core, Banana Fish shows that in their society, crime is more than just a social problem. In our society, criminal activities are not tolerated and punishable. In the world of Banana Fish, characters believe they are above the law. Some even believe they are the law. Let\u2019s take a closer look at Ash for instance. Having being raised by Dino, it\u2019s clear that he has a dark past that\u2019s explored more and more as each episode progresses. While I don\u2019t consider Ash to be a villain, there\u2019s no doubt that he has committed questionable acts. As this show takes place during a period of gang warfare, Ash stands out as more of an antihero to me than a protagonist. And of course, the man who raised him wants nothing more than to destroy Ash. I think in many cases, Dino wants to destroy Ash\u2019s soul rather than just his life. It\u2019s a fate perhaps worse than death and just one of the few examples of how cruel characters can really be. Indeed, Banana Fish contains mature content that isn\u2019t suited for a younger audience. Going back to what I said before, Noitamina\u2019s audience expands beyond than just a general audience and Banana Fish is an example of that.\\n\\n\r\nAdapting a manga from over two decades ago isn\u2019t an easy task. Manga being resurrected again after all this year tends to lose steam but I can say with supreme confidence that Banana Fish hits the marks. It manages to recreate a sensation of the 1980s while the anime takes place in a more modern setting. Rather than going with any flashy style of presentation, it commits to bring the manga\u2019s characters up to date. Characters such as Ash and Eiji are designed to look exactly how their personalities are meant to be. Gang wars and violence are showcased without holding back with the intense bloodshed. There\u2019s also some daring scenes of man service present that may be nerve wrecking or pleasing to watch. As I mentioned before, there are cases of gay moments although it\u2019s not distracting to the point of losing its main focus. Watch this series and you\u2019ll see that it\u2019s more than just a homosexual relationship between two men. In addition, I have to give some well-earned praise to the voice acting in the show. These characters are older than your typical high school students and crime lords like Dino isn\u2019t easy to portray. Yet, they all looked pretty damn believable in such a time period. \\n\\n\r\nBanana Fish is a show with a peculiar title that could probably be quoted often. It\u2019s Akimi Yoshida\u2019s most well-known work and MAPPA manages to produce such a series with commitment. Director Hiroko Utsumi worked on Free! in the past so it\u2019s no surprise that you\u2019ll see some man service along the way. But really, Banana Fish isn\u2019t just about a gay romance story between two guys. It celebrates the chance to showcase a crime story in a setting of corruption, revenge, and politics. Now it\u2019s your chance to experience that story.",

            "content": "*THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*\r\n\u201cHe very definitely told your father there's a chance \u2013 a very great chance, he said \u2013 that Seymour may completely lose control of himself.\u201d \u2013 J.D. Salinger.\r\nA soldier\u2019s life is one of hardships. Seen as the pride of a nation, they are tasked with defending the honour of their motherland with both flesh and blood. A life that requires chivalry, discipline and steadfastness. Their existence serves as a beacon light to the tame and cowardly; a source of inspiration for the youth to grow strong. But underneath all the glory and medallions reveal a darker tale more telling of their lives.Ordinary people before donning a uniform and sent off to war, a life of violence and suffering entails them. A hellish nightmare seeming to never end makes it near impossible to return to their former self. One must be physically and mentally tough to ever hope to survive such a turbulent time, but not everyone is capable of carrying that weight.\\n\\n\r\nJ.D. Salinger was one writer who certainly understood the pressures put upon people in severe circumstances such as war, through first-hand experience being drafted into the US army in 1942, even being hospitalized by \u2018combat stress reaction\u2019 months after Germany was defeated in World War II. He was clearly affected, going so far as stating \u201c[he] found it impossible to fit into a society that ignored the truth that he now knew.\u201d These events all informed his writing of the short story titled \u201cA Perfect Day for Bananafish\u201d. While numerous interpretations of the story do exist, the common belief is that it symbolizes those soldiers sent off to war and came back traumatized; gorged by the anguish brought on from war and stained of bloodshed. Decades later this short story would be loosely referenced to in the successful shoujo manga series Banana Fish, written and illustrated by Akimi Yoshida that would later be considered highly influential to the BL subgenre. And now over 20 years since the manga\u2019s initial release, Banana Fish received an anime adaptation produced courtesy by Studio MAPPA to run for 24 episodes in the latter half of 2018.\\n\\n\r\nBanana Fish focuses on the relationship between Ash Lynx, a cold ruthless teenage gang leader in New York City, and a na\u00efve assistant photographer from Japan in Eiji Okumura. Both men, despite appearing as polar opposites in personality and upbringing end up being caught in a fallout over an entity known as \u201cBanana Fish\u201d, that also happens to be related to Ash\u2019s brother and what occurred on his stint in Iraq. The pursuit of this mystery further pulls Eiji to the centre of this conflict, thereby leading to Ash pushing against the wishes of his bosses and gang members who put the safety of his newfound friend in jeopardy. It would be easy to summarize the story as simply a developing romance between two men, but the series is more concerned in making the story and overarching weight of it at the forefront of the tale, causing the narrative, despite being heavily reliant on genre tropes, to work effectively as a fast-paced charming thriller. The series uses heavy topics regarding drugs, sexual abuse, corruption and other mature themes to craft a careful drama that avoids sensationalizing the sheer brutality inherent with such subject matter. Likewise, these ideas further accentuate the thematic correlation between Salinger\u2019s \u201cA Perfect Day for Bananafish\u201d and this loosely inspired adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nNo other character is as carefully crafted nor developed to the same degree as the main protagonist Ash Lynx. His backstory alone would be enough to garner the sympathy of many: a boy who ran away from home at 8 years old only to be taken into custody by the head of the Mafia. Having been kidnapped as a sex slave numerous times later before being granted leadership of a street gang years later, he has seen his fair share of violence and trauma. Part of his likability derives from him never seeing himself as a victim and therefore is able to overcome adversity. However, his meeting of Eiji is what ultimately acts as the cause for Ash to slowly reveal himself emotionally and properly recover from trauma accumulated throughout the years. His character easily parallels that of Salinger\u2019s protagonist, as someone who has been exposed to so much that the idea of recovering from it all is improbable. Both of these characters take a liking to their more innocent counterparts, seeing in them what they once had but now have lost for reasons that were outside of their control. Clinging to that one person in the hope to keep them sane, and in the case of Banana Fish, no matter how the world might see Ash, Eiji will remain by his side. But similarly to Salinger\u2019s short tale, it may not be enough to help Ash change to a more civil lifestyle. \\n\\n\r\nDespite the original manga being set in the 1980\u2019s, Studio MAPPA decided to move the setting to a more modern time and as such caused various changes to the anime that deviate from the original source. Some of the most obvious examples include using character designs typical of the current animation standards rather that the original\u2019s well-defined character models, and the implementation of technology such as smartphones used by the majority of the cast. These changes, whilst they may come off slightly off-putting are fairly harmless in the grand scheme of things. Although when it comes to contemporizing the story and its themes, there are numerous issues that arise. For example, by revising the setting to present day, many of the topics covered can be considered outdated and requires a certain suspension of disbelief not to lose any immersion the viewer has with the world established. This take also renders most of the social commentary the original story had as nearly obsolete, which was one of the aspects that made the manga so important for its time. It\u2019s something that most viewers probably wouldn\u2019t have a problem with, as it still remains a piece of fiction that can be enjoyed without social context. But for those that want to look at this show deeper that the ordinary fan, it\u2019s an issue that can easily cause disappointment amongst certain anime fans.\\n\\n\r\nAnother key issue that I personally had throughout watching was how many elements regarding the plot and characters slowly become narrowed as the series continues. Allow me to elaborate; the beginning of this show was really appealing, not only on a visual level with how vibrant the settings were and the distinct designs on display, but with how many different parts there was to the plotline. From the main characters, to the supporting cast gang members, to the numerous villains, to everyone else involved, each of these groups felt like their own intricate parts to the storyline that had the potential to create something truly special. But as the plot continues, it becomes apparent that the storyline is only meant to focus on the relationship between Ash and Eiji. This is not necessarily a bad thing \u2013 Banana Fish revolves around this in particular. But I can\u2019t help but feel disappointed when a show with so many moving parts to begin with are funnelled out to prioritize all the screen time on the core plotline. Especially if comparing the anime to the manga, which gave more balanced attention to the large cast of characters intertwined. The villains all had varying degrees of depth but none of which I would honestly call complex, most characters not associated with a gang are shafted halfway through the anime and the gang members that are fleshed out are always given time and focus corresponding to their relationship with Ash. This is not a severe knock against the show, but I can\u2019t help it when I see a series like Banana Fish have so much potential and not seriously capitalize upon it.\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals for Banana Fish are a solid outing for Studio MAPPA. While I have my personal preference for character designs, the animation present here is energetic in how it depicts character movements and expressions, as well as providing the audience with some very exciting action scenes. The dynamic colour palette and background art are both visually appealing that while some might consider it detrimental to the tone of the show, I believe do better to initially attract anime fans to the series in general, acting as a pleasant treat for the eyes at first glance. The framing of the most controversial events that took place in Banana Fish was also commendable in giving the series a good sense of artistry. \\n\\n\r\nThe audio for Banana Fish is also praiseworthy with strong performances for voice acting overall, really capturing the essence of each main character. The soundtrack also fits most scenes well despite none particularly standing out, except for the OP and ED tracks which is just simply fun to listen to. No matter what your music taste, these tracks are pretty accessible and make for fun openers to each episode. The translations however could definitely act as a detriment to the series as a whole depending on your take of the sensitive topics covered in Banana Fish. Personally I found it funny when Ash calls a separate character a \u201cfag\u201d in the translation considering what the series is about, but some could easily take such as a homophobic slur and the anime as a whole as tone-deaf. Just be careful what you\u2019re getting yourself into, k? :)\\n\\n\r\nLooking back on Banana Fish, I see a series with a lot of upside to it. A carefully handled crime drama, innovative for its time, critically acclaimed source material, etc. And despite having my own criticisms against the series I would still recommend this to anyone interested in the series at all. Despite creative liberties it is at its core a well-made drama with emotionally powerful moments that are likely to entrance you in a tale barely brought to light by anime. There may be homoerotic undertones present, but the series was not made solely for such. Instead it clearly values a strong appreciation for storytelling, for that is how people from all different backgrounds are able to relate to what is told here at a fundamental level.\\n",

But why limit one\u2019s exposure to the opposite sex, when there are plenty of \u201cgay-fish\u201d \u2014 I mean, banana fish \u2014 for the taking.  Why else would a Shoujo anime feature two young queens in New York?  For a \u201ccrime\u201d investigation?  Now that\u2019s rich.\r\nSpeaking of wealth, the main character in theshow, Ash Lynx, was groomed to inherit a vast amount of opulence and power through the successive process of becoming Dino\u2019s heir.  Be that as it may, the early steps of \u201cgraduating\u201d to his \u201cdestined\u201d role were mired with egregious abuses of standing law and personal freedom.  Not one to remain docile and allow circumstances to be determined by the judgement of others, Ash seized the initiative in an attempt to ameliorate the atrocities of his past.  This manifested into a plot to assassinate Dino via \u2014 and I kid you not! \u2014 standing on top of a moving truck in a public arena, while shooting a pistol.\\n\\n\r\nO\u2014KAY, then\u2026.\\n\\n\r\nNot one to put all his pumpkins in one basket, Ash used his adroit computer skills to plunder $90 million from Golzine and severely handicap his financial clout as a Mafia Don.  This blow to the ruthless Kingpin allowed Ash to claim an important victory and set the stage for the ensuing battle to come.  That being said, however, Ash\u2019s ability to steal Golzine\u2019s money and manipulate his company\u2019s stock price seemed too straightforward.  If Ash had that sort of capability, why not use that skill to make himself fabulously wealthy (say, like, a billionaire) and use his newfound fortune to assemble a crime syndicate that would dwarf that of Golzine\u2019s?  Furthermore, why did Ash risk his life with ridiculous, poor planned stunts when his intellectual prowess could easily circumvent Golzine\u2019s physical brutality?\\n\\n\r\nTo underscore this point, allow me to present the following:\\n\\n\r\n1)  Ash has an IQ of 180; placing him in an echelon of exceptionally gifted individuals (rarified air, if you will).\\n\r\n2)  Ash understands military-level tactics at a proficient level, commanding his gang to coordinate attacks against their various foes.\\n\r\n3)  His various senses are finely tuned and his anticipation of danger is second to none (well, maybe Batman has him beat).\\n\\n\r\nYet, instead of making use of these various skills to sidestep hazardous situations, Ash willingly embraced instability via having a knife fight in a subway station against his gang rival, Arthur.  In the midst of their battle, predictably, Ash get\u2019s ambushed by Arthur\u2019s gang \u2014 proving how poorly planned Ash\u2019s plans truly were \u2014 and is forced go John Wick on their candy asses (highly unrealistic, by the way), before his final Mortal Combat-esque showdown.\\n\\n\r\nLook.  Ash has far too many advanced abilities for his own good and they become contradictory at times.  Most protagonists who are portrayed as elite fighters have a weakness in the planning/thinking department and vice versa; however, Ash literally can/will do anything.  Even the greatest QB of all time, Tom Brady, can\u2019t run faster than a six year-old girl to save his life (butt-hurt Patriot fans incoming).  Counterbalancing greatness with a deficiency elsewhere is a great way to explore a character\u2019s resolve, through their willingness, or unwillingness to ameliorate their weaknesses.  Match Ash\u2019s flawlessness with his attractive appearance, and you have a character that is simply too good to be true.\\n\\n\r\nEiji be like, \u201che\u2019s a sweet candy bar in the bedroom, especially when he wears his nurse outfit.\u201d\\n\\n\r\n\u201cYes.  I can confirm this.\u201d  \u2014 Golzine\\n\\n\r\n\u201cMe too.\u201d \u2014 Shorter\\n\\n\r\n\u201cHershey chocolate is so delicious, sweet caaaaaaannnndddy bar.\u201d \u2014 Arthur, Max, Su Rin, Yut-Lung and about half of New York City (everyone except for the LAY-DEES!)\\n\\n\r\nThis brings up another concern with the story, that being that everyone and their father are homosexual, or have homosexual tendencies.  I have no qualms about an individual\u2019s personal choice, but is it conceivable to think that every man Ash runs \u201cinto\u201d has the hots for him?  Seems rather absurd, when only ~4.5% of the population identify as being gay.  \\n\\n\r\nDue to the plethora of melancholic moments throughout the series, it was quite evident that the conclusion of said events would not be a happy one.  Deducing the exact ending was nigh impossible (unless you read the manga), but anyone who presumed that Ash and Eiji would both survive their ordeal was ignoring the foreboding atmosphere established in the prior episodes.  This insight on \u201cwhere\u201d events would lead, sort of ruined a level of anticipation for the viewer, but not enough so to be a significant hindrance.\\n\\n\r\nThe review thus far has been scathing, but there are redeeming qualities that make Banana Fish worth watching.  While the characters within the show are not layered or terribly complex, they do come off as being \u201creal,\u201d particularly with the omission of classic anime tropes.  Their actions mirror that of \u201cnormal\u201d people, making the flagrant abuses seen or talked about feel extremely impactful.  It\u2019s hard not to become attached to Ash\u2019s cause of exacting revenge on Golzine, especially considering that his brother became entangled in the B1 (i.e. Banana Fish drug) \u201cexperiment.\u201d  Banana Fish, to its credit, pulls at the viewer\u2019s heart strings \u2014 perhaps, too frequently \u2014 to establish an atmosphere not unlike our world.  It damn near forces the audience to empathize with the plight of Ash Lynx and cheer him on as he dismantles the mob empire that robbed him of his innocence.  Is it rudimentary in its approach?  Yes, as indicated in the earlier parts of this review; nevertheless, Banana Fish provides exhilarating action sequences (even if they don\u2019t make sense within the context of Ash\u2019s projected character), moments of shock and awe, and some rather interesting character interactions.\\n\\n\r\nWith that said, Golzine\u2019s character felt pedestrian, exhibiting features that were not distinct enough to differentiate him from your standard mob boss.  The biggest takeaway anyone could discern from his screen time, is that he is a closet homosexual and he is infatuated with making Ash his sex slave.  In essence, he merely serves as a mark for Ash to conquer in his quest to liberate himself from the crime syndicate.  Marlon Brando\u2019s, Vito Corleone, is an excellent example of how one could/should construct a terrifying human being who instructs his \u201cbusiness associates\u201d to leave a horse head in a director\u2019s bead, but also lives by a set of principles and accumulates wealth for the sake of his family.  People, even the so called \u201cevil\u201d ones, will always have redeeming qualities that contrast the malicious activities they deem necessary to accomplish their goals.  Rarely does anyone consider their own actions to be immoral, giving a writing staff an opportunity to flesh out these \u201cjustifications\u201d and determine why these particular people think in ways that abnegate the norms of a typical society.  Deep, complex characters with diametric views always make for interesting conversations, forcing the audience to introspect and reconsider their own viewpoints about topics that have no clear answer.  Banana Fish, unfortunately, fails to entertain these narrative motifs.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR\\n\\n\r\nMuch like its namesake, Banana Fish is a mixture of good and bad.  How so?\u2026\\n\\n\r\nBananas are high in potassium and other useful nutrients; Bananas contain high amounts of carbohydrates.\\n\\n\r\nFish are high in omega-3 fatty acids, which lessens one\u2019s risk of experiencing a heart attack or stroke; Fish can have high amounts of mercury, leading to brain defects.\\n\\n\r\nBanana Fish is an exhilarating ride with a large cast of diverse characters; Banana Fish presents an unrealistic protagonist who takes unnecessary risks to take down an underdeveloped antagonist in Golzine.\\n\\n\r\n5/10\u2026.meh, make it 6/10 (tis the season, after all)\\n",

            "content": "Since its publication in a shoujo magazine in the 1980s, Banana Fish has received several labels such as boys\u2019 love (BL), shounen-ai, and yaoi due to popular misconceptions. Not only are these terms incorrectly applied to the work, but they also do not cut at the meat of what Banana Fish is. And even its original shoujo demographic tag deeply misrepresents the content of this anime. \r\nDrugs. Rape. Pedophilia. Gangs. PTSD. Violence. Corruption. \r\nThese are the terms at the core of Banana Fish. Though at the same time, the crime and gangster backdrop is not all the story is about and confining it within thoseboundaries massively undersells the broad scope of topics this anime covers. Because while Banana Fish's pragmatic and deplorable world is filled to the brim with death and sexual violence, the tale it tells of its main character, Ash Lynx, is a visceral story about life and love. And just as deliberate as its juxtaposition of death with life and lust with love, Banana Fish is a carefully woven story about dichotomies. Its two halves, like the darkness and light reflected in its two main protagonists, Ash and Eiji, permeate this character drama in numerous ways to paint a grounded tale about both the ugly and beautiful aspects that make us human.  \\n\\n\r\nWith little exposition to back it up, Banana Fish sets up intrigue from the outset and primarily uses its early episodes to build character back stories, motivations, and tension until its first major climax. From there, the copious amount of setup spent on its foundation gets grounded and becomes meaningful. Although Banana Fish has an overarching narrative, its story can be broken down into multiple arcs. The narrative shifts seamlessly from arc to arc; however, the tone between them can vary drastically. These tone shifts combined with Banana Fish's brisk pacing, does cause sudden mood swings, that at times lead to whiplash. But overall, its purposeful tonal dissonance is used to great effect to accentuate the light and dark themes that imbue its story. Its pacing allows eventful occurrences to happen every episode but sometimes hurts the show in its calmer hours. And unfortunately, the anime rushes a few episodes in the second cour to accommodate the daunting task of adapting nineteen volumes of manga into twenty-four episodes of anime. While in its other weaker moments, Banana Fish can suffer from clumsy plot developments, become somewhat fantastical, and get repetitive with both innocuous and annoying elements, overall, the story rarely ceases to entertain and because it is comprised of many moving parts, it often takes unpredictable turns that keep its audience on their toes. Though because a large amount of finer details were cut, viewers are required to pay close attention and often read between the lines, which at times, can lead to the discovery of surprise character nuance.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Banana Fish's story can be described as its weakest element, its characters are its strongest. Despite having a rather large cast of relevant main and supporting characters, Banana Fish adeptly characterizes the important ones in a short amount of time and consistently develops them throughout the narrative. As a result, characters as well as their interactions are both dynamic and engaging. At the center of this ever-evolving maelstrom of personalities is the two protagonists, Ash and Eiji. No other character in Banana Fish is as carefully realized or developed as Ash, who teeters between his hardened persona and vulnerable self seamlessly, but the complex, multi-faceted relationship Ash and Eiji share come close. Their relationship, while not the focus of the story, is just as important as the plot. It never becomes physical because of Ash's past, but the emotional connection between the two cannot be understated as it develops both protagonists and organically becomes the emotional foundation in which the narrative is founded upon. However, unfortunately, due to the limited episode count, several side characters are stripped of their more nuanced character traits that can be found in their manga counterparts. And even Eiji was regrettably simplified in the anime. Antagonists of varying degrees of depth and competence will come and go. All are twisted in their own way, most will be hated, and some are more than they seem. While Banana Fish is not one to have overly complex antagonists, mainly because writing sympathetic rapists and pedophiles goes against the themes of the piece, they all serve the narrative purpose that they were written for even if it is not entirely clear from the outset. However, Yut-Lung and Blanca deserve special mentions for not only being complicated and interesting, but for also highlighting Banana Fish's themes by serving as impressive foils. Each character has been made to life by talented voice actors, but most notably, Uchida Yuuma, the voice for Ash, has given a powerful performance with resounding care and heart put forth in conveying all of Ash's complexities.\\n\\n\r\nConsistent with other series produced by studio MAPPA, the animation and art quality are spectacular for the first several episodes before eventually becoming a series of ups and downs. The latter half of the show and the action-oriented episodes in particular have suffered as the anime progressed. For this sole reason, it is recommended to watch the Blu-Ray release, which has already been confirmed to have touchups. Despite its dips in animation and art, Banana Fish's cinematography remains very strong throughout its entire run. Storyboarding is consistently dynamic, and when applicable, framing is done with a certain message in mind. The music composed by Shinichi Osawa, also known by his stage name, Mondo Grosso, while not necessarily memorable, is distinct, stylish, and fitting. \\n\\n\r\nAs an adaptation, the anime does a commendable job in keeping the manga's spirit in spite of its brutally short episode count. MAPPA makes predominantly solid decisions on the material to cut and while the anime loses some of its plot cohesiveness as a result, prioritizing the character moments was the correct call. And in general, the manga is a highly recommended alternative for those interested in the gritty details that the anime had no choice but to leave behind. However, despite the strengths of this production, not all of MAPPA's adaptational choices enhance the experience. Most notably, the decision to update the original manga's 1980s setting to modern day in the anime has been baffling. Character designs have been modernized and smartphones have been given to the majority of the cast but the world continues to exude an anachronistic 80s vibe. While this may seem to be a harmless cosmetic overhaul, contemporizing Banana Fish means covering dated topics. This becomes most apparent when the anime delves into political maneuvers that would be more plausible in the Cold War environment that the original manga was written in. And because Banana Fish is a product of its time, the anime, though not always through the fault of MAPPA as Amazon has also mistranslated generic insults into homophobic slurs, contains elements that can be considered tone-deaf in today's sociopolitical climate. If anything, this adaptation should be treated as if the setting was still in the 1980s as the moderization Banana Fish's world received are largely superficial and even leads to plot inconsistencies. \\n\\n\r\nWith the vast majority of anime released nowadays abiding by successful formulas and character stereotypes, Banana Fish stands out as one of the rare few that is unafraid to take risks. Its brashness in that regard will inevitably land itself many criticisms but hidden beneath its rough exterior is a gem worth digging for. It touches upon heavy subjects without sensationalizing or sugarcoating their brutality and its grounded approach makes it a unique work that is more reminiscent of old Western action films and television than that of anime. It shows us the truly wretched sides of humanity but also reminds us of the hope and love individuals all possess while expertly invoking an array of emotions. From start to finish, it is a hauntingly real depiction of the very essence of being human. And despite the flaws in its story and adaptation, it leaves much to ruminate about. It is a deceptively simple story that can become complex in the themes it explores and the topics it leaves its viewers to ponder. Even the series' namesake, derived from the short story \"A Perfect Day for Bananafish\" by J.D. Salinger, and references to other American literature in the form of episode titles or overt mentions offer food for thought. Banana Fish is far from perfect, but at its core, it is an unforgettable rollercoaster of relentless action and raw emotion. The manga broke genre barriers over thirty-years ago and while the anime regrettably does not retain all the qualities that made the manga as groundbreaking as it was, it does deliver its own one of a kind experience with much of the same heart. There really is no other anime like Banana Fish. And it is one no one should miss.* \\n\\n\r\n*Disclaimer: but only if you can stomach the long list of heavy content this show has",

Almost all characters are gay, and except Ash none of them are explored, at all. They are interesting but meh at the same time. I've read the manga, it faces almost thesame problems.

            "content": "Let me start off by saying this: if you've written this off as ~ohh sexy yaoi for the fujoshis~ before even watching an episode, you're not only gross but missing out on a great anime. Does Banana Fish has scenes with two men sleeping together? Yes, but they are all without consent (except one, I think, maybe two depending on your idea of \"consent\") and the fact some male anime fans are writing this off as some sexy story for us fangirls is really demeaning to the struggles of Ash, the main character. Banana Fish does heavily hint at a romantic relationship between the twoleads but it's not in your face.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nBanana Fish does something most anime do not - they show sensitive topics like rape without fetishizing it or making a joke out of it. BF touches on almost every sensitive topic you can think of: murder, rape, drugs but almost all of it is treated as what it is: bad. The rape scenes are never explicitly shown or used as sudden shock factor. And remember, the manga came out in the 80s when this stuff wasn't even talked about as much nevertheless with such care and respect.\\n\\n\r\nNow as for the actual story, it can get a bit convoluted for sure, especially at the end, but it's never bad. It's definitely detailed though and pretty interesting, especially once everything gets moving at a faster pace around the middle of the story.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI absolutely adore the animation and character designs. That's all I can say; I think it looks great and smooth and fits the story really well.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI usually end up skipping openings after a few episodes, but BF has been an exception to this cause it's a really nice song that gets you pumped and sounds like something I'd listen to from some of my favorite American bands. As for the actual soundtrack, I don't pay much attention to that - sorry.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nBF is known for its amazing characters. Ash is a kid who went through hell and is just trying to survive. He's not afraid to get his hands dirty but time and time again shows he isn't some monster. Eiji starts out as a pretty spineless character but grows to stand by Ash's side as his friend (and maybe more). Then we get a lot of side characters who might be involved but in some shady things but prove they're human too: Shorter, Sing, Cain - two of which will be introduced later. They all stick by Ash's side and end up being really likable and interesting characters.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the bad guys? Completely despicable. They're not villains in a magical settling who use magic to take everything over or anything over the top like that - they are realistic terrible people doing things that happen in our real world and that's what's so scary.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSpeaks for itself. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nA lot of people are going to be turned off from BF cause of pretentious dude anime fans who think anything with any gay themes is just for fujoshis and should be skipped over but that's not the case. BF is an amazing story of friendship and tragedy and deserves to be given a fair shot. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "\u201cWhat is Banana Fish? I heard it\u2019s some Yaoi anime so I\u2019m not going to watch it\u201d\r\nThese are the type of comments I\u2019ve seen floating about in regards to Banana Fish. I wanted to address this first, because it\u2019s a huge misconception about what the show is about. In fact the closest thing to \u201cYaoi elements\u201d is the relationship between the two main leads. \r\nStory (10/10):\r\nIn a time when most shows nowadays are generic isekai light novel adaptations, or eechi harems with self-insert dense MC, filled with cliches and troupes- Banana Fish manages to be a compelling, gritty, complex story about gang warfare, drugs andthe mafia. There\u2019s no fanservice or silly harem here, hell there\u2019s barely any women in the show!\\n\\n\r\nThe story is set in the 1900s, about a rebellious gang leader named Ash Lynx, who wants to get revenge against Papa Dino Golzine (who happens to be the man who raised him and treated Ash as his sex toy) for having his older brother injected with a drug named Banana Fish, which through a circumstance of events results in his death. The story may sound simple, but there\u2019s a lot more plot threads and characters at work along with the mystery about what the Banana Fish is, that slowly build the story making it more complex.\\n\\n\r\nBanana Fish tackles dark and mature themes such as: drugs, violence, mafia, gang warfare, rape, child trafficking, pedohilla and corruption. However, it\u2019s not used to be \u201cedgy\u201d, but done in a subtle way without sugarcoating the brutality, to serve a narrative purpose in the story. Due to the realism and raw storytelling, there may be moments where one might find it uncomfortable to watch, so in other words, Banana Fish is not for the faint of heart.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (10/10):\\n\r\nThe characters are complex, well written, diverse and memorable. You have amazing side characters like Shorter Wong, Max, Sing, Yue Lung and his revenge arc against his brothers, to Eiji- who\u2019s depicted as a innocent, pure hearted retired athlete who knows nothing of the world of gang he\u2019s suddenly thrust into, but wants to stay by Ash\u2019s side. However, none of the characters are as carefully well crafted or developed as the main protagonist, Ash Lynx. Ash is honestly becoming one of my favourite characters of all time because of how complex and multi faceted he is. I love the dichotomy in his character from a beautiful, cold hearted, ruthless, competent, mature, gang leader & hacker- to this innocent, down to earth, kind hearted, 17 year old kid who\u2019s never had much of a childhood and has been dealing with years of insecurities and psychological trauma. Also, the parralels between Eiji and Ash are well written.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s some overreaching villains like Arthur and Dino who admittedly aren\u2019t   amazingly well written, but they\u2019re still good characters who are developing and give off a threatening vibe. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation (8/10): \\n\r\nCompared to it\u2019s manga counterpart, due to Studio MAPPA\u2019s storyboarding and beautiful dynamic animation, the anime is a thrilling experience to watch!\\n\\n\r\nSounds (10/10):\\n\r\nThe opening is amazing. I love the visuals and the fact that it doesn\u2019t spoil too much of the story. I listen to it everytime I watch an episode. The chorus especially is catchy and memorable \u201cInside my head, inside my head!!\u201d xD\\n\r\nThe osts are really good and the ending song is amazing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10):\\n\r\nI love Banana Fish. There\u2019s not been one episode where I felt was boring or thought was filler because of the well paced narrative. It saddens me to think of how many people skipped this anime because they heard about a Yaoi anime. Banana Fish is a underrated gem that deserves a much higher ranking on MAL.",

            "content": "The summer 18 anime season was very problematic as it was the season that was dominated by anime that contained 12/13 episodes and many of the anime unfortunately fell flat in the face either because there were either bad throwaway shows or they ended up getting crippled by the 12th/13th episode count where some of the show they had enough content of to make a 24/26 episode but set studio poor decisions making these show only ended up having the episode count that they ultimately got. This doesn't say that the summer 18 anime was a complete failure as it did give a couple ofgreat shows that I liked such as Chio's School Road, Revenue Starlight, Planet With and High Score Girl.\\n\\n\r\nAfter looking at the countless 12/13 episode animes that summer 18 season had to offer in the charts I saw two anime that had 24 episodes and these anime were Banana Fish and Mr Tonegawa: Middle Management Blues aka the Kaiji spinoff. I observed skipped the Kaiji spinoff from the time of this review because I have only seen a first 4 episodes of Kaiji and I wanted to watch the whole series first before going into this. So that leaves me with Banana Fish done by Studio Mappa. \\n\\n\r\nDespite me having a negative opinion of Mappa thanks to them making a bunch of shows (Not counting Yuri on Ice) that barely don't much substance to them aka Rage Of Bahamut Virgin Soul and Days I decided to give Banana Fish a shot just to see if they learned from the past mistakes that caused me to dislike them as a studio. Well after watching all 24 episodes of Banana Fish I can say yes Mappa has kinda learned a lesson from the past mistakes but at the same time I feel Mappa at times is still playing that style over substance card.\\n\\n\r\nThe story follows Ash Lynch a 17-year-old man has been adopted off the streets by the head of the New York mob papa Dino as a sex toy. However, after he comes across a man left for dead in an alley, he has added a necklace with a bullet attached to it which contains a secret white powder.\\n\\n\r\nAsh now has the ability to fight back against pana Dino and to possibly free himself from his grasps and this is all because what is in that bullet. While this was happening a journalist named Shunichi who come to document the gangs in New York City. He brings a cameraman assistant named Eiji to help him take pictures however he ends up getting caught in the confit between Dino and Ash and from there Ash journey towards freedom begins.\\n\\n\r\nI have mixed feelings for the story of Banana Fish as it has a lot of good things in it but at the same, it has quite a lot of meh things in it which I will talk about in the bit but first let's talk about the good things in Banana Fish's story.\\n\\n\r\nOn the surface, Banana Fish has a unique setting that is very different compared to most anime these days. Instead of being set in Japan Banana Fish is set in New York Urban style. Despite the show having a different overall setting, the series goes a solid job at establishing the New York setting as it fullest where see people doing gang/mafia activity left and right and we also see the people who are not part of the plot live they daily lives in peace. This aspect one of the stronger things in Banana Fish because it really makes the world feel alive as the viewers know that New York has a dark side where it's filled with gangs, mafia and druggies who do these dark acts that would have been illegal.\\n\\n\r\nThe one thing that I really liked of Banana Fish was how it was able to show the ugly side of humanity as it does showcased a lot of acts that only the worst of people would commit such as rape, human drug experiments, gang warfare, etc. On top of the shows, nice portrayal of showing the worst of humanity comes with the shows excellent theme exploration as the show explores themes of freedom, regret, betrayal and the show does a great job at respecting its core themes and topic s\\n\\n\r\nIf there was one thing that Banana Fish nails at its the emotional moments. This easily the most emotionally engaging anime from 2018 period because not only they are beautifully well executed but we see the characters break down into their worst state. The best example of this happens in the second half episode (Spoiler Ahead) After Eiji gets shot and sent to the hospital room we see Ash mentally broken.\\n\\n\r\nSome other great emotional moments when a character named Shorter gets drugged while Eiji couldn't do anything about it. What really made that scene even more sadder is that both Ash and Eiji cannot cure and as a result Ash had no choice to shot him to simply end Shorter pain and as a result of Ash mentally breaks down due to the fact that he couldn't save his one of his close friend from being drugged by the Banana Fish by Abraham.\\n\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, Banana Fish has problems. Lots of problems and many of these problems ended hurting the anime.\\n\r\nFor starters Banana Fish at various times feels like a style over substance flick as the show seems to highlight it's visuals over storytelling at times. To Banana Fish credits it's not as bad as something like Days or Virgin Soul but still, consider it a problem that ruins the overall writing quality in the show at times.\\n\r\nAnother problem with I had with Banana Fish that is pretty repetitive. \\n\\n\r\nIt was fine seeing Ash and Eiji getting kidnapped/arrested the first couple of times but after a while, it really got trying seeing one of these two characters getting kidnapped/arrested than later on getting rescued by set person. I understand that this kidnapped is meant to be part of the show theme of freedom but could they least not make happened every 2 to 4 episodes of Banana Fish.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem with Banana Fish is without the question is the pacing. While the first four episode of Banana Fish pacing wise was good and engaging but after that pacing moves a blazing speed where it was actually hard to tell what is going on in the narrative. I understand that the show trying to adapt a 19 volume manga into a 24 episode series but I feels the episode count for this series actually does more damage to the show then it helps especially when the show starts rushing/cutting out content in the second half of the series.\\n\\n\r\nNow I haven't read the manga from this time of this review as I decided to go full anime only mode but I easily tell that the show, especially in the second half, is rushed as hell. If this show had 39 episodes like Jojo Part 4 and 5 then this show would have been a better experience but as it stands the pacing in Banana Fish is a mess.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I found the story of Banana Fish to be above average. It did a quite a lot of good things in it but at the same time, Banana Fish has a lot of problems story-wise that prevent it from being a well-told story. I understand this show is mainly a character driven rather than a story driven but if your pacing is inconsistent like this then it's honestly hard for me to care about some characters which I will talk about now.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the story ended up being above average overall the characters least the main 2 protagonists completely make it where I can somewhat forgive the pacing issues of Banana Fish.\\n\\n\r\nFirst up we have Ash Lynx who is a former. Not gonna lie he is easily the best thing about Banana Fish. He is a very well written character who simply wants to be free from Dino's antics. His journey was very satisfying as we see him not only to find freedom by stopping Dino's plans but he also wants to protect Eiji from any harm caused by Dino and the villains. During his childhood years in Cape Cod, he was raped by his Little League coach, and the cops did do anything at all until Ash himself had to kill him with the gun.\\n\\n\r\nHe was eventually sent away from his father to live with his aunt however he soon gets captured by Golzine's man as soon got send to Club Cod as a child sex object. Why am I telling you all this you may ask? That's because Ash is literally a broken person who just wanted to live a normal life and every time Ash breaks down we can see his pain and suffering he has endured throughout his life and because of these reasons, Ash is great character and he's easily one of the best characters of 2018.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Eiji may not as memorable as Ash he still a pretty solid character. He's a polar opposite to Ash where he gets sucked into a mafia world being completely naive and clueless about the situations that Ash managed to drag himself into. Despite his naive attitude at first, he is willing to help Ash accomplished his goal of freedom from Dino and the rival gang.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters, on the other hand, were underdeveloped, and that's the sad part because the other characters in Banana Fish could have been great but the rapid pacing leaves them totally underdeveloped where you ultimately don't care for them. The best example of this was with Skip and Shorter. Outside of the introduction episodes, I couldn't care about them all that much because they didn't enough arrive screen time thanks to the rapid pacing. Shorter's death as much I enjoyed Ash perspective of that scene I couldn't care on Shorter perspective as the show failed to give him a decent spotlight.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the villains, I thought they were one dimensional and lacked any real depth whatsoever especially Dino who is a just a typical villain who likes experiment people with drugs. Even though the villains in Banana Fish lack any depth to speak off I feel like the show does a beautiful job at making the viewer loathe them so there that.\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals in Banana Fish is for the most part pretty good.\\n\r\nMAPPA did a good job with the character designs, background scenery for the setting of Banana Fish. The cinematography and use of urban colour palettes were very polished as it the show did a fantastic to bring key scenes from the 80s manga to live in anime in such brilliant ways. \\n\r\nThe animation is filled, consistent and nicely animated. Yes, it had a couple of shotty visuals cut moments episodes 13 in a nutshell but least it's not as bad as something like Goblin Slayer and Tokyo Ghoul re:\\n\\n\\n\r\nI may be the notoriety here, but I found the soundtrack of Banana Fish to be underwhelming. It's just a selection of generic mafia/gang that you all heard before in any action thriller anime. \\n\\n\r\nAll the opening and ending themes in the show were good, catchy and memorable in their own ways.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting in Banana Fish was outstanding. As a person who usually a dub only watcher, I was blown away of amazing and well acted the Seiyuu were. My favourite performance was hands down Yuuma Uchida. He did a wonderful portraying a broken lovable character Ash and it really makes the anime as the character struggles feel alive.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, Banana Fish from the time of this review hasn't got an English Dub and as a dub fan, this hurts because this show would be perfect for a semi-cast Funimation dub thanks to its American setting, themes and tone that is way different from the typical anime that is set in Japan. I hope this show gets a dub one day done by Bangzoom Entertainment and if it does get a dub I hope Johnny Yosh Bosch would voice Ash.\\n\\n\r\nAh, Banana Fish. You had so much potential to be one of the best animes of the year but the writing in the second half, the underdeveloped side chararters and the unhealthy blazing speed pacing ruined it. \\n\r\nLook Banana Fish is not a bad series but at the same time, I don't think it's all that great. It is a decent series that has a lot of good things in it like the character Ash, the themes and production values but everything else ranges from meh to pretty shallow. \\n\\n\r\nDespite it's problems, I still recommend Banana Fish to people who are looking for a fun action flick that has a strong main lead. \\n\r\nJust don't expect this to be one of the better animes from this decade because you will only end up being pretty disappointed as a result.",

            "content": "This is the first anime that make me create an account and write a review for it, because I want to recommend others that you should watch Banana Fish (BF). It is just incredible, from the animation, camera angle, action scene, plot, story, character design, soundtrack, everything is just awesome.\r\nThe story is very realistic. It talks about all bad sides of our world (rape culture, drug, pedophila, corruption) and also the comparison between America and Japan, where people allow to have gun and where people cannot have and also do not need a gun in their life, which is a powerful and meaningful base forthis anime. The plot is very connected and always bring you surprise. Every episode is very heavy, but mixed with some comedy and it make me love BF even more. \\n\\n\r\nNot like other anime, where everything happens slowly (a fight take for 1 or 2 episodes) or the pacing is very slow or the character reading their thought (it always drives me nuts), everything in Banana Fish is incredibly well-organized. The pacing is very accurate, give you enough time to feel and understand the situation (with beautiful music in the background) and not taking anything for a nonsense long time. Every dialogue is really connected to the story and also contain a profound meaning.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is magnificent. The first anime that every scene has a good human proportion with both face and body. People interaction looks very realistic, and people in the background are not just standing like a mannequin, they always doing something like a real person. It makes the anime looks more realistic. The background: New York city with many gorgeous graffiti on wall and a splendid liberty statue; china town which always crowded with people, restaurants and lanterns; the Cape Cod's nostalgic view in a windy field with beautiful dawn (it's a very sad scene); and especially the gorgeous Los Angeles city filled with night lights from the mountain's view. Many camera angle choices are very unique and clever, the animation crew did an awesome jobs on this anime.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack: its awesome, just listen and enjoy. My favorite is the ending song Prayer X by King Gnu, it gives me a nostalgic feeling mix of happiness and sadness (T.T). The opening clip is very beautiful with a fit music too.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoy Banana Fish more than I expected and have to read the manga because I can't wait a week for each episode (I regret for doing that, 'cause I know what will happen now T.T) Banana Fish has become my second favorite anime now, after Fullmetal Alchemist. It will become 1st place in my list if Mappa change the ending of the story. 10/10 for this anime and totally recommend other to give it a try <3  and remember to get your heart ready.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I don't usually write reviews, especially for anime but I really wanted to give my two cents on Banana Fish in the hope it might encourage someone to give this show the chance it deserves.\r\nAt its core, Banana Fish is an anime covering heavy topics like rape, drugs, gang violence and paedophilia which it shows with refreshing realism. There's no casually ignoring clearly pedophilic actions or  'uwu non-consensual yaoi', and nothing is used just for the shock value of seeing it on screen. Banana Fish treats these topics with the weight they deserve and doesn't sensationalise or normalise them like they often are inso many other anime. These topics do come up quite a lot, and I could see how one could argue that they are being used gratuitously (especially rape), but I believe it is handled well. There is no moment where the weight of what is happening is glossed over or ignored, especially by characters in the show (unless that desensitised view in itself is a part of a character). \\n\\n\r\nYes, Banana Fish does have gay characters, but it is definitely not what I'd consider a 'yaoi'. One of the reasons I avoid most yaoi anime (other than overdone and heteronormative tropes) is the sickening use of rape between the two love interests as a way to get fanservice into the show or to progress the relationship. Banana Fish shows rape and sexual assault as the disgusting, demeaning crime it is, instead of depicting it as a way to 'get the guy' so to speak. It's also so nice to see an anime that puts its plot and characters at the front and centre, instead of having the sexuality of the protagonist's fuel the entire show. So far Banana Fish has done a pretty great job of avoiding the issues that usually run rampant in anime with gay main characters and I'm really excited to see how they handle the budding friendship and (hopefully) relationship between Ash and Eiji. The groundwork has been laid for a genuinely well-written relationship and hopefully, they'll continue to impress me so I can add this to my list of anime with good gay representation.\\n\\n\r\nI was surprised how quickly I became invested in the main cast, and now after only six episodes, I can barely wait to see what trouble Ash and his little entourage get into next. Ash is an incredibly compelling protagonist with a complex tragic history and interesting set of morals, and Eiji is an excellent contrast to that without being a polar opposite. This dynamic is definitely something I'm looking forward to seeing the most. The supporting cast is also awesome, I especially love Shorter and his pink mohawk!\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is well developed and has some beautiful elements that help to set apart from many other styles that have been prevalent lately. This is especially noticeable in how the faces are animated. It really fits with the themes of the show and often helps to deliver, and at times further, the emotional impact of certain scenes. The sound used is equally good, and I often find myself turning up the OP when it plays despite being one of those terrible people who usually skip the opening... \\n\\n\r\nBanana Fish hasn't been perfect though (and I can't expect it to be). There have been a few slurs chucked around in the subs which I was quite surprised to see. It could be due to mistranslations etc. but it was still a bit jarring to see f*g used in the subs of an anime. \\n\\n\r\nTo sum this up, I'm impressed with how Banana Fish is handling the heavy subject matter it mentions without sensationalising it. The anime was definitely not created to pander to fujoshis, but instead aims to tell a plot and character driven story that includes gay characters/undertones. The characters are complex and interesting, and all of this is wonderfully complemented by the art and soundtrack. Overall I have high hopes for Banana Fish and am looking forward to the rest of the season!\\n",

            "content": "It is well known, even mentioned in the first two episodes, that Banana Fish borrows its odd name from a classic short story written by JD Salinger called \u201cA Perfect Day for Banana Fish.\u201d What is somewhat less noted, however, is how perfectly this reference captures the theme and style of the manga and anime series. Salinger\u2019s story tells of the suicide of Seymour Glass, a World War II vet. The most famous passage of the story features a young man telling a young girl of the \u201cvery tragic life\u201d of the Bananafish species who enter a \u201cbanana hole\u201d as \u201cvery-ordinary looking fish\u201d and gorgethemselves on bananas until they are unable to escape and die.\u201d In many ways, the life of these fictional fish mirrors the life of the main protagonist in the anime, Ash Lynx. One critic of Salinger (Janet Malcolm of the New Yorker) has noted that Salinger depicts life \u201cas a battleground between the normal and abnormal, the ordinary and the extraordinary, the talentless and the gifted, the well and the sick.\u201d This, too, is a very apt description of the picture we get of the dark world in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nBanana Fish tells the story of Ash, a brilliant 17-year-old boy. Ash was raped at a young age, ran away from home and taken in by the mafia as a sex slave, worked is way up in the organization after winning the favor of the mafia boss (and main antagonist, Dino Goldzine), and is currently a gang leader in New York. As might be expected of anyone with such a tragic background, Ash is extremely mentally unhealthy, verging into becoming a full-fledged sociopath just like his abusers. Into his life comes Eiji, a rather normal yet caring Japanese photographer traveling with a journalist documenting gang life in America. Here we immediately see the contrast between normal and abnormal, well and sick, and talentless and gifted, and how this contrast might hopefully be resolved in Ash and Eiji\u2019s relationship. Yet Banana Fish is also about a riveting mystery around what \u201cbanana fish\u201d\u2014not the fictional species of Salinger\u2014is, its connections to a massive plot involving the military, and the development character of a large cast of interesting, well-developed gangsters who act as fantastic foils to Ash (particularly a Chinese mob master named Yut-Lung).\\n\\n\r\nThe basic concept of the plot is intriguing, engrossing, and thematically dense. It plays in morally gray areas beyond good and evil, capturing some rather Nietzschean themes about the healthiness or unhealthiness of basic morality. Do \u201cnormal\u201d moral constraints merely domesticate prodigious nobles like Ash or helps humanize such people and making them truly happy? Ultimately, Banana Fish takes the side of the latter. It further explores extremely dark psychological dimensions of post-traumatic stress disorder, graphic depictions of sexual assault and violence, manipulation, and psychological torture. Be warned, this is not a series for the faint of heart. Yet it consistently gives room for characters to realistically react to these events, and console each other through the darkest of moments (this becomes the cornerstone of Ash and Eiji\u2019s relationship).\\n\\n\r\nIs the execution of this concept, adapted from Akimi Yoshoda\u2019s classic, critically acclaimed 1985-94 manga series, any good though? I have not read the manga so cannot comment on its status as an adaptation. However, I can say that it largely stands up on its own merits. Some have raised concerns about MAPPA\u2019s decision to put the series in modern era rather than its original setting in the late-80s. I agree it probably would have been stronger in its original time. There are moments where some events strain credulity in a modern setting. The whole notion of a gang scene this active and violent in New York makes sense in the 80s in a way it no longer does, some of the projects the military engaged in so central to the plot were more fitting in the Cold War than the modern context, the lack of professional female characters in even in the background (eg., doctors, police, etc.) is somewhat odd in 2018, and a lot of the political commentary is more suited to 1980s America than modern day. Overall, there is very little distinctive about the story that demands a modern setting. However, these are rather minor gripes and if we can suspend our disbelief for so many plot-hole ridden absurd fantastical shounen anime, a little anachronism and is completely forgivable.\\n\\n\r\nAnother somewhat valid complaint is the unbelievably high concentration of homosexual/bisexual male characters, or at least those who are willing to engage in sexual acts with other men. Sometimes, it is unclear whether the characters want to have sex for erotic reasons or are simply using sexual abuse with other males as a method of control and power (as is usually the case with sexual abuse), and this particularly is the case with Goldzine and Foxx. In these cases, it is forgivable, and clearly having Ash and Eiji show such tendencies was rather necessary. Yet there are moments where I cannot help but agree with this criticism, such as a rather unnecessary scene where Ash successfully (and comically) seduces a random security guard so he can steal his gun and escape. But again, for the era when the manga was written an overrepresentation of homosexual content was hardly a pressing problem. Further, the fact that a prominent anime is finally exploring homosexual themes while not engaging in a rape fetish like most garbage-tier yaoi, but instead critically presents sexual abuse as traumatic is to be celebrated.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the main plot, Banana Fish ambitiously packs a huge amount of content into its 24-episode run, launching right into the action in the very first episode. At moments it feels slightly rushed (especially the last two episodes). Further, there are scenes, background stories, and subplots I wish the series could have had time to explore in far more dept hand detail\u2014such as Ash\u2019s childhood, Ling\u2019s backstory, or the culture shock Eiji must have had on a road trip across America.  It also is somewhat wanting of a better explanation of what Eiji is even doing here. \\n\\n\r\nDespite this, it largely is remarkably well-paced for such a short though ambitious project. After some of the most disturbing, action-packed, and climatic scenes, it will go into almost slice-of-life style episodes where little happens that allow for character development on a level rarely attained in such action-heavy crime dramas. So much of this series suggestively shows the development of relationships and dynamic character changes(especially the budding romance between Ash and Eiji) in a subdued manner rather than telling you what\u2019s happening very bluntly and directly. These episodes are a welcome break and its development of the main characters in these episodes and scene are where it truly shines.\\n\\n\r\nThis is not to say, though, the main action-packed scenes are not good. They are fantastically directed, some of the best-looking fight scenes that could be hoped for. Some may find the events somewhat cyclical and repetitive, jumping from one kidnapping and escape sequence to another. For one, this is somewhat of a simplification of the events, and more importantly, each climatic sequence is sufficiently different to retain interest. If we can make it through most repetitive, drawn-out, and trope-dependent shounen fight scene arcs, this is amazing by comparison. \\n\\n\r\nThere are some relatively minor flaws in its writing. Most notably, a few backstories of key characters introduced later in the series are explained in a somewhat rushed manner. I would have preferred this series be about ten or so episodes longer to more thoroughly develop these characters. However, it certainly got the job done adequately. Another problem is the dialogue is sometimes clunky and awkward. At times, this is due to obvious translation errors in the subtitles (the translation of \u201cfag\u201d in the first episode is obviously inaccurate and off-putting even as someone who does not speak Japanese, and \u201cI will kill whomever hurt you\u201d is not a grammatical sentence). Other times, it is clearly the fault of the writers and just corny\u2014such as the end of a key scene where an antagonist maniacally laughs in a cartoonish manner in episode ten. There are also moments where ill-fated attempts at humor are awkwardly thrown into otherwise serious and dark scenes. Yet, overall, the writing is heartfelt and believable, and these minor slip ups can be forgiven.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation and directing, it is rare to see such a feast for the eyes outside of carefully crafted films by an elite few directors. There are scenes that took my breath away with how well they were executed in terms of cinematography. Zooming in on details in the background that were previously only subtly gestured towards for profound emotional effect, interesting perspectives taken in unpredictable though fitting ways, and extremely disturbing and violent scenes where little gore is shown but audio cues and off-focus camera angles let the imagination run wild all contribute to a powerful, raw, and artistic visual experience. There was fantastic attention to detail down to the labels of whiskey bottles.\\n\\n\r\nThe largest success in terms of animation are the character designs and especially the movement and expressions of some of the main characters. Just watch the second intro (featuring \u201cFreedom\u201d by Blue Encount) on YouTube, which starts with a captivating image of Ash\u2019s pupil\u2019s dilating, to see just how successful this series is in this respect. This is not to say the animation is perfect, there were a few incongruous moments of mediocre CGI implementation in the first two episodes (see, for an example, the Statue of Liberty shot in episode 1). However, even these were barely noticeable, and the animation improved noticeably as the series went along.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is as versatile as it is suitable. It mostly accompanies in a subdued manner and even remained silent in all the right places. It mixes dissonant piano melodies, jazzy hip-hop beats, and dark choral pieces into a rich audio tapestry. I did not notice it while watching it on a weekly basis, yet when I binged through the whole series in one sitting the day of the premiere of the finale it became clear that soundtrack is good. Further, the vocal performances by most of the voice actors, particularly Yuuma Uchida's portrayal of Ash, are pretty stellar. Even the choices for intro and outro songs, often integrated into key scenes, are amazing and completely fitting in both tone and lyrics.\\n\\n\r\nI do not believe that I have ever personally held a series in such an overwhelmingly positive regard that seems to be largely receiving, at best, mixed or tepid reviews (at least relative to my estimation). Perhaps it\u2019s because I approached it with such low expectations. I was expecting another mediocre shoujo/shounen-ai with half-baked crime elements but was stunned by the dark and rich world into which it immersed me. I watched each episode as it came out and was shocked by how much I liked it, then I decided to binge the whole thing in one sitting to see if really lived up to the hype I was giving it and decided it did. This truly is a series that defies any genre or box you could try to put it into. I've seen it categorized as everything from Seinen, to crime drama, to adventure, to Shounen-ai, to Shoujo. Perhaps its all of these, but really feels quite beyond all of them. \\n\\n\r\nMaybe I\u2019m just overreacting to its personally relevant and impactful twist ending (which, without spoiling anything, was one of the biggest and most surprising emotional gut-punches I\u2019ve ever experienced). Maybe I\u2019m just overly excited I finally found an anime with a fantastically developed homoromantic relationship. Maybe I just read too much philosophical content into it. Regardless, I can\u2019t help but completely love this series and give it only the second perfect 10 I have ever given, despite its admitted flaws. Perhaps I will downgrade my estimation of it after some reflection. For now, though, sits second on my favorite list only behind Brotherhood.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nEnjoyability: 10/10\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n",

            "content": "**Spoilers but whatever**\r\nThe first 4-5 episodes are pretty damn good and if the show kept my interest after those, I would rate this show higher than I did. Unfortunately, it falls into those boring anime tropes that really ruin the interesting story they had going on.\r\nI didn't have a problem with how most of the characters in the show are either gay or extremely progressive in their views on homosexuality, but they take it so far so that every single character Ash meets has to say how '\"pretty\" or attractive he is, even these tough mobsters and gang leaders and the straight married adults inthe show. That was pretty weird. Where the show started failing for me was when the main characters friend ( or love interest, they really leave that question wide open) starts getting upset that he kills people all the time, despite knowing he was a gang leader and WATCHING HIM KILL PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE SHOW. Then when Ash starts questioning the kind of person he is for killing all these people, despite having been doing it in gangs for the entire second half of his life. He has been running a gang for years, he kills people almost every episode, I have no idea where this guilty conscience suddenly came from. Then when they start making it look like he's some sort of genius with elite hacker skills, it all falls apart. This guy has been a male prostitute and sex slave since he was like 11, it seems like he never even went to middle school and grew up in this rural town with nothing in it until he was kidnapped by a mob lord. Where did he learn how to \"hack a computer\", much less funnel 90 million dollars from foreign bank accounts by selling fake stocks and then immediately purchase a massive condo in New York with cash? Well they never explain any of that, and considering the realism they put in so many other parts of the show it's really strange how easily that went about. Then in the later episodes he just hides in plain site with glasses on like he's Clark Kent and nobody ever catches him, which is total bullshit. I just don't get why they started pushing this bogus \"genius\" persona for him, when he was just a badass mobster with good people skills up to this point. It just became a cliche and it was really hard to keep the same level of interest when they started throwing out all these lame plot devices in the middle of the season.\\n\\n\r\nTLDR; It was good until Ash suddenly becomes an elite hacker genius who randomly gets a guilty conscious after killing people his entire life, therefore seeming more like a little bitch and less like the badass he was made out to be in the first several episodes. He gets less and less likable every episode while every character in the show seems to think he's the hottest genius on earth.",

            "content": "So I rewatched this anime a second time. All 24 episodes. Not out of desperate need or desperate desire to rewatch, but to accurately rate this material for myself and for you, since I forgot things and the momentum was broken, since I watched while it was airing and saw episodes inconsistently.\r\nIt\u2019s honestly very difficult to classify this show. It\u2019s about gangs, but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s about drugs, but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s about survival, but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s about love, but it\u2019s not. Willing to sacrifice everything, but at the same time not budging to compromise who you are and why you fight no matterwhat.\\n\\n\r\nBanana fish very accurately depicts and reflects truths about corruption within political systems: Politicians that sell-out, human experimentation, drug distribution, child sex trafficking circles, under-the-table deals with mafia leaders, military contracts, etc. Very real issues are portrayed, and Banana Fish does not hold back in regards to showing the viewer how horrendous human beings can truly be.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough it is easy to become infatuated with this work by many means (the artwork, the music, the story, the bl, or just Ash Lynx and his dynamic character), it is important to know that this is a unique story, and many people will go into it with expectations that will let them down. If you\u2019re expecting an anime with 30 simultaneous and convoluted storylines like HxH 2011, then this won\u2019t live up to that expectation. If you\u2019re here simply for what you heard may be shounen-ai, you will probably be disappointed. The story is much more than any potentially showcased relationships.\\n\\n\r\nIf you ask people what Banana Fish is about, you will most likely get very long answers. The story itself isn\u2019t hard to follow, but there are many aspects to it: drugs, politics, rape, freedom, power, violence, gangs, friendship, revenge, and all of these play key roles in the overall story.\\n\\n\r\nIn essence, Banana Fish is the story about a boy who constantly endures tragic and unfortunate events wherever he goes. A boy who doesn\u2019t let his past dictate who he is. A boy who wants to love the world, but is not allowed to lower his defenses. A boy who is willing to sacrifice everything he has achieved to protect his friends. Who goes against the grain every step of the way, yet manages to remain humble. A boy who obtains power by his own incredible wit, charm, and strength. For revenge? Ambition? Justice? Freedom? For love? You tell me, but would you sacrifice your life in hopes that someone like this boy would let go of their baggage and begin to live a life they can be proud of? How would it feel if at any moment that person could disappear right before your eyes, and you are powerless to do anything about it? This is the story of Banana Fish.\\n\\n\r\nI really do admire this animation for how effectively it illustrates human emotion and conflict. Despite the awesomeness of this show, there are a few things that could\u2019ve been done a tad better. I have heard people say that plot points in the story became repetitive in regards to certain situations, and in a sense that is true, but after watching it a second time (with a better grip of how/why things happen in the show), I\u2019ve realized that the progression of the story is so real. It is pretty impressive the amount of material that was packed into 24 episodes, and while there wasn\u2019t a huge amount of room for character development for every single main character, the main cast did have depth, and they had great interactions with each other, and the second time around those \u2018repetitive\u2019 situations really didn\u2019t seem repetitive at all. Yes there are characters that made arguably thoughtless decisions as they were written to, but there was plausibility and reason in every choice made, and the story was carefully crafted over three decades ago to arrive where it did.\\n\\n\r\nWhat really did it for me were the great shootouts and fight scenes, coupled with the emotional scenes that complimented them, the lovely soundtracks that carried certain scenes and that stuck with me afterwards, both OP\u2019s and ED\u2019s (especially the first ED), the progression of the main characters and their relationship, and to the total disagreement of many, how the antagonists were handled.",

            "content": "I've never written a review before, my apologies.\r\nThis anime had me hooked at the first episode. From the brilliant animation and impeccably detailed illustrated environments, to the fast paced- but not rushed- plot line. The episodes hardly left you on a frustrating cliffhanger, but i was always left wanting more. I'd always find myself asking questions every Thursday in the episode's wake, like \"How big of an issue does Banana Fish actually get? Will Ash really be able to protect Eiji and manage to watch his back simultaneously?\" I couldn't keep my mind off it.\r\nHOWEVER, as you've probably figured out, this anime fits into thecategory of a TRAGEDY. And it follows that to a T. You'll probably walk away from this series feeling heartbroken.\\n\\n\r\nTaking a step back and observing the subtle elements that brought more color to the story, I found that the scattered references to American literature were the ones that stood out to me the most. From minute comparisons to Salinger's Catcher in the Rye, to Ash's whole life being a tragic parallel to Hemingway's Snows of Kilimanjaro. It brought so much depth- you could almost believe BFish was a true story.\\n\\n\r\nAnd on the subject of the characters, they felt just as real. There are a plethora of interactions which you'd expect to see in real life. There's Ash's right hand man, Eiji Okumura, who is comfortingly benign versus Dino Golzine who caused almost all of Ash's problems. They really broaden the spectrum of personalities seen within the story. Even so, they were not without their flaws. Every single character against Ash is shown to be homosexual, and it disrupted the believable flow the show seems to be so good at.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the soundtrack, it is easy to overlook, but if you pay attention it is actually very well done and contributes a lot to the mood of every scene. I was so excited when Ash was walking down that alley in the beginning of the first episode, even though nothing was really happening (at first). Some of the ones that stuck with me were #1 BANANA FISH, #21 TEARS OF THE LYNX, #30 HIM AND HYM, and #44 PRAYER. The openings and endings have somewhat applicable lyrics, the first two songs are great.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally, the ending. Personally, I found the last episode to be very rushed plot-wise, and that made it difficult to really empathize or feel the grief/joy that I was anxiously anticipating as opposed to the the manga which really drew it out. That being said, the last episode is what leaves the last, and most important impression. The series as a whole is gorgeous and high quality, but it was hard to remember that. But don't get me wrong- the last episode wasn't bad. In fact, I had tears in my eyes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is an absolutely fantastic anime. It explores LGBT themes without being the focus of the story or blatantly pandering to an audience. The majority of events happen at a satisfying pace with appropriate placement of soundtrack, and characters that you can become easily attached to. It doesn't skirt around the grotesque themes like rape and human trafficking, but won't show the disturbing unnecessary details that can be derived from situational context/ hinting. There are so many nuanced situations and that's why I love it. It makes you think AND feel. It just doesn't classify as a shoujo/BL, it's so much more than that and you'll hear this from almost anyone who's watched Banana Fish.",

If the man break up the boy, what do you think he will be in the future? \r\nWrath and sadness. It depends on every emotion, He will lose sight of the essentials.

At the same time, many conspiracy and mastermind surrounding him.\\n\r\nHe wonder if he can change thrust into the harsh reality? Can He lead brilliant future?

He got his hands dirty, and he move up current capacity.\\n\r\nCriminal act named underworld happen frequently. Ash is living among them. His power and his buddies are dependable.\\n\r\nEspecially Shorter is irreplaceable existence for Ash. And Eiji Okumura came from Japan for some reason.\\n\r\nAsh and Eiji come to considerate each other carefully. Ash's true feeling is terminate this conflict as soon as possible.\\n\r\nAnd he want to pass peaceful and happy days with his buddies. I think it is desirable thing for Ash.\\n\r\nBut atrocious villains including Golzine disturb Ash. So Ash will taste same bitterness over and over again, take punishment close to torture.\\n\r\nNevertheless, Ash never give up. Because of he has firm faith. He kills emenies in front of his eyes without hesitation. It is task and fate of strong man.\\n\\n\r\nNotable Advantages are well made characters, world-view. This show is depicting clearly combined with beautiful art and animation by MAPPA.\\n\r\nAsh is basically cool and clearheaded character. He can accept human who he recognized. He has generosity. Anyways, he is attractive.\\n\r\nEiji is meddlesome and tender-hearted boy. He is conscious of Ash as his friend and buddy. I have good feeling of him.\\n\r\nOtherwise, Lee Yut Lung appear in later episodes. He also charming. His cunning makes me scary. He is really dangerous.\\n\r\nPersonally, I like Sing Soo-Ling, too. His voice and looking are my type. He is vigorously young man in good meaning.\\n\\n\r\nI don't read manga though, I understand Akimi Yoshida's unique essence and storytelling. These annex this show exquisitely.\\n\r\nClever and coherent dialogues, go above and beyond, many thrilling scenes. There is variety as if it weren't already enough. Keep us from being bored.\\n\r\nSolid style what unbefitting shoujo genre is this show's symbol. Probound scenes between everywhere and soft design are truly excellent. I feel shoujo there.\\n\r\nElocution also dopeness like Crime film. It is modern version of The Godfather. If you like Mafia drama, you're into this show.\\n\r\nAs proportion, male characters are so many. Female characters are overwhelming little. Opinions are divided. But I like it.\\n\\n\r\nOP and ED songs are surprisingly wonderful. 1-cour OP makes us hunch divination about spectacular story, ED is depicting Ash's trouble politely. 2-cour also same.\\n\r\nThis show is first TV anime's tie-up of Survive Said The Prophet. Lyrics and Melody are fitting this show perfectly. And so cool.\\n\r\nI became of this band fan by this show. My favorite music genres are Rock and Metal. So my compatibility with them is suit.\\n\r\nThanks to this show, I also became fan of King Gnu. Tune that I wouldn't think mixture is admirable.\\n\r\nVoice acting is perfect, and fitting each characters. Especially Ash! It goes without saying that his attraction is further increased.\\n\\n\r\nFlaw is only this. Raw and such as heart is painful scenes are so many. It cannot be helped. But these certainly sore.\\n\\n\r\nHuman has salvation even if fall in a dilemma invariably. Anime what It feels even more like that is Banana Fish.\\n\r\nThis show is absolutely not for everyone. Far distant position. That's why this show is so realistic.\\n\r\nHowever, I recommend more many people. The reason is that this show is not only interesting, I want you to know familiar important people's value again.\\n\r\nI'm jealous for Ash and Eiji. Their relationship is very similar to me and my elder brother. So I empathize this show.\\n\r\nThis show is close to masterpiece. I think this show is quite underrated. Awesome show.",

            "content": "I wanted to love this series, I really did. The first 2 episodes were amazing, I honestly thought I had a masterpiece in my hands but as the show progresses I am proven pretty wrong. The story was brilliantly intriguing, the characters interactions rivetting, but sadly that's the only thing that has kept me from dropping the show this far. The plot alone is flawless in my opinion and the premise pretty unique, though it is a bit strangely paced at some points that's forgivable.\r\nGenerally, my biggest pet peeve with it is the slow but sure decrease in the quality of the art, I meanit happens with most anime as they progress but with Banana Fish, it was extremely noticeable, like to the point where in some frames the characters don't even look like themselves and it bothers me to no end. The first few episodes were really well animated and I have to admit the unique look was one of the things that got me into it in the first place but its so sad to see what it has become at this point.\\n\\n\r\nAnother pet peeve was the soundtrack, I want to like it but in most scenes, it just ends up making me cringe. It just comes off as cheesy or overdone. I mean the scenes are meant to be dramatic or heart wrenching but they just end up falling flat as the soundtrack can't carry particular scenes or they are just really poorly framed.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are Banana Fish's saving grace. Honestly, they are pretty well constructed and as the audience, you really end up emotionally invested in what they are going through. All in all, the show is worth watching purely for the story and characters and I still do recommend that everyone interested watch this show. It might not be a masterpiece but its definitely quite original.",

If I had one complaint about that it is that they had changed all the character's most iconic outfit looks.\r\nThe characters in the show are fun. Ash, who has had terrible things happen to him, still manages to smile and have fun with his friends. Eiji, who knows nothing about the life of crime that he is thrust into, is starting to show us more complex sides to him. Shorter, as expected, is amazing. And, though bald Shorter will be remembered, I likethat they let him keep his hair. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot is speed up quite a bit in order to fit it into only 24 episodes but they seem to be hitting the main plot lines fairly well. (If you want to see more cutesy bonding and joking around, read the manga! :) ). I am excited to see how the anime further progresses, especially once some more characters are introduced.\\n\\n\r\nI will say, if you are here looking for the next yoi or for gay romance 'uwu' this isnt the anime for it. The relationship between Ash and Eiji is full of love and I do believe they are soulmates, but with all the trauma that Ash has experienced, you just aren't going to get that here. (unless the anime goes WAY off book. at which point i may have to change my review).\\n\\n",

            "content": "Honestly when I first heard of this show, I thought it would be boring, just a confusing anime about drugs and mafias. While that IS the case somehow with every new episode I get more and more excited.\r\nStory: 9\r\nAlthough I am not a fan of stories about drugs, pedophilia, etc. Banana Fish does an excellent job at telling it's story with the characters, or at least that's my opinion. While the show handles such topics it shows how characters care for each other, not always in a romantic way. By friendship, by family, etc.\r\nIs the story Original? Well I'm sure there are plenty of notjust anime but any story in general that handles these topics but again the characters seem to be the reason for this anime's success in storytelling.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\\n\r\nArt styles like Ouran Highschool, Is the order a rabbit? and Blend S makes it look like all characters you meet are from the same country (Or are of the same race). In Ouran there have been quite a few characters who aren't or aren't fully Japanese although it's art style suggest they are all of the same race.\\n\\n\r\nHowever Banana fish's style makes it clear for it's viewers to tell what race they are, Black, White or Asian, And this anime does not have what people call 'Same face syndrome'. Another anime I could say has a similar way of showing one's race through art style is Yuri on Ice, whether the character is Russian, Japanese, Canadian, from Thailand, etc.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\\n\r\nI myself is a person who would watch Dubs if it were available, the fact that Banana fish didn't had a Dub was one of the reasons I hesitated to watch it.   \\n\r\nHowever when I first heard the voice acting in the first episode, All I could say is it's pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nThe voices really fits what kind of character they are, other background sound effects are good as well, The OP is very catchy and relates to one of our main characters, Ash lynx.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\\n\r\nFor me, the story is almost nothing original, there are plenty of stories not just in anime but in general where it would handle such topics, However with these characters for me is what really made this anime stand.\\n\r\nTo me my favorite was Eiji, (Don't worry these won't be spoilers ahead)\\n\r\nthroughout the story (so far) Eiji is shown to be an inexperienced person (Compared to Ash who has experienced rape, killing people and Drinking, which is something people his age wouldn't normally experience) but throughout the situations he encounters he is a very kind person willing to be by ash's side as much as possible.\\n\\n\r\nYou might be thinking \"Oh GREAT! This person's just a Fujoshi!\" actually I am not, in fact I really hate shounen-ai and shojo-ai (As someone who is Biromantic) However this anime shows the two characters caring and being by each other's side. It's not all sex.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nEach episode is always exciting, discovering what would happen to the characters and what new amazing and heartfelt things would happen, there was loss and wins and it's very enjoyable (again) especially with the very likeable characters you meet.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\nIt has it's flaws but also it's Good sides and I think it was the Good ones that sticked out to me the most. not a perfect 10? Well again I'm not a Big fan of stories with such topics but Banana fish was able to make this series very enjoyable.",

            "content": "I haven\u2019t cried actual tears over fictional characters in a while but damn. I\u2019m a mess.\r\nI was a little hesitant to start Banana Fish, mostly because I couldn\u2019t quite figure out wtf it was about. My gods, do not let anything weird, the age of the source, or anything deter you from watching/ reading this beautiful beast. My friend got me hooked on the anime, and I plowed through the manga once episode 19 of the anime got released because I\u2019m impatient and can\u2019t wait. I\u2019m so glad I did, I have even more appreciation for all the work that went into the anime. Butbe warned, it is in a tragedy category for a reason. So many tears. \\n\\n\r\nthis is kinda long and spoilery ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n\r\nEiji Okumura is an innocent cinnamon roll fresh from Japan. After an injury ruined his pole vaulting career, he finds himself lost and unsure of what to do with his life. Ibe takes him under his wing and enlists him as his assistant in America where he is reporting on street gangs.\\n\\n\r\nAsh Lynx is on the polar opposite of the innocence spectrum. The 17-year-old is the leader of a thriving gang in Manhattan and has been through hell and back. After his brother left for the army, Ash ran away and was kidnapped by Dino Golzine, the head of a child prostitution ring. Under Golzine\u2019s \u201ccare\u201d Ash was trained to be his personal pet, where he learned how to please customers, behave as a member of high society, as well as fight and wield firearms. \\n\\n\r\nAsh instantly takes a liking to Eiji during an interview with Ibe. Their bond deepens when they are captured by a rival gang and Eiji sacrifices himself in order to save the others. They end up working together to uncover the mystery of Banana Fish, a new synthetic drug, while dealing with the struggles of rival gangs and Golzine. \\n\\n\r\nThe differences from anime to manga were minimal, mostly slight appearance changes. Ash is a little more soft and fluffy in the anime, and Shorter never shaves his mohawk. There\u2019s a lot of backstory missing or displaced, which I\u2019m assuming was just due to time constraints that always exist with anime. They tried so so hard to make scene match the art in the manga, I appreciate that aspect so much. They were very detailed in sticking to the source materials. Even with them modernizing it a little, the biggest change is that they all have cell phones and it doesn\u2019t really make a difference to the story.  \\n\\n\r\nThis is really the best addition to the shounen-ai genre. Ash and Eiji just love each other for a multitude of reasons, and it\u2019s nothing sexual. They just compliment each other, and fit together like puzzle pieces, like the Jian bird from Chinese mythology that has one wing and one eye and must fly in pairs to make a whole. There\u2019s nothing creepy or forced about Ash and Eiji, they just care about each other and want to see each other happy. It\u2019s just so wholesome.\\n\\n\r\nI love all of the characters. The side ones are fleshed out, they have a story that matters as well. You really get to know each and every one of them (at least in the manga, the anime has some time constraints :c but it still counts ok.)\\n\\n\r\nAnd oh the end\u2026 the end fits so perfectly. It makes me horribly sad and I really wish Ash could have found long term happiness. He was granted little blips once Eiji came into his life\u2026 but we never got to see him completely happy and at ease. His whole life was pain, and I just so wanted to see him happy and safe and in Japan with Eiji forever. He\u2019s so loveable and just a damaged baby and I want the world for him. But his death makes sense in this setting. It\u2019s realistic and really just completes the series in a way. I was definitely more emotional about the manga but I always am with reading. The animation would beautiful and they kept it true to the manga and oof my lil heart hurts all over again.\\n\\n",

            "content": "It was July this year when I kept seeing people fangirl over the first few episodes of Banana Fish in my Twitter TL. I've heard of its manga 11 years ago when it was mentioned in this one book that I read (I forget the title) as one of the best mangas of all time. But I ignored it because it simply didn't pique my interest at that time. I was going to pass the show up too like I did the manga, but a screenshot of Ash\u2019s and Eiji\u2019s \u2018scene\u2019 in the prison successfully served as bait for my rotten fujoshi mind and mademe make a self-reminder to watch the show sometime later. I did so 3 months later with an expectation for a show that\u2019s full of fujo-bait, stereotypical fangirl-material characters, and shallow plot.\\n\\n\r\nBut never have I felt so happy for being so wrong.\\n\\n\r\n[Story: 9]\\n\\n\r\nWhat I like the most about Banana Fish's story is that it's consistent from the very start to its final moment. It always feels like everything is at stake. Viewers were kept on the edge of the seat every time, so we can feel a palpable tension of wanting to know what\u2019s going to happen next because nothing is certain. In such a way, this is a show that's very proper to be binged because the plot is moving very seamlessly from one episode to the next. Every Easter eggs come back around the way (in my opinion) FMAB does.\\n\\n\r\nYou may partially argue that some of the crimes or plots were orchestrated far too dramatically, but in actuality... they don't. Banana Fish's world is as fucked up as the world we're living right now. Illegal human trials for medical and military purposes, money-laundering, VIP child sex ring (check out Jonathan King and stan Twitter's latest outburst: #SimonCowellOverParty), street and gang fights over territories/hierarchy/revenge, etc. All of that and how they cleverly use the setting (my favorite is the inter-state travels and the show\u2019s explicit use of NY city design) actually make the show feels very real and believable.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the key information used was pretty spot on too. I\u2019m a pharmacy student & /almost/ everything about the drug discovery process in the show are pretty accurate (well, except the VERY hard-to-believe pharmacological action of the drug itself. Like, sure it can let you hallucinate, but I don't think one will become a puppet that can be controlled via exclusive command).\\n\\n\r\nAside from that one topic, there are actually two more (spoilery) pet peeves that made me take a point off of the story:\\n\\n\r\n1. It seems that the story goes on for at least 3 months. So I don\u2019t get how Eiji & Ibe can stay that long without renewing their visa. Did they apply for a journalist/media visa for that long? And if Eiji got arrested during that time, won\u2019t that make his return to Japan difficult even after someone bailed him out? This protocol issue might be a minor ordeal but it's something that always creeps up in the back of my mind when I'm watching the show.\\n\r\n2. It\u2019s VERY weird how Ash can always bait people with the promise of sex. Like, I know his character design is supposed to make that possible for him but I don't think a professional doctor or security (whose job is to goddamn secure their captives) fall for that OBVIOUS trap.\\n\\n\r\n[Characters: 10]\\n\\n\r\nBanana Fish is a show that despite features a rather diverse (all age, all race, all facial/body features, all kinds of personalities) and large cast, didn't fail to make each of the characters stands out in their own way. They were all complex, felt real, and human-like. Everybody (no matter how big/small their part is) had their own agenda that happens to overlap with each others\u2019 and affects the course of the story in the long-run.\\n\\n\r\nI wanted to diss the two main antagonists (Dino and Foxx) as stereotypical evil characters, but when I thought of it again, even they who served as nothing but the ultimate evil scheme executioners, seemed real because hedonistic, power-hungry bastards like them exist in real life too. And it\u2019s no surprise that people like these often take the reign in politics and business.\\n\\n\r\nOur main duo, Ash and Eiji, were not a problem for me too. Ash was very complex and fleshed out. He seemed slightly overpowered at times, but it\u2019s clear that he\u2019s not flawless. Eiji, on the other hand, almost made me took off a point for \u2018characters\u2019 for being too simple and vessel-like. I almost criticized him for being a mere \u2018friend of Ash\u2019 instead of a character of his own. However, I tried to recall earlier episodes and remembered that what geared him in the first place was actually not solely for Ash\u2019s sake. Eiji is a Japanese young-adult who have always been sheltered in the comfort of his small hometown. So when he was injured, robbed of a chance to delve into a sport that he\u2019s interested in, and was introduced for the first time to this exciting and dangerous world he had never experienced before, his actions became /his/. And when he grew closer to Ash, /that/ is when I can accept that he did things for Ash\u2019s sake too.\\n\\n\r\nAs for their relationship, I wouldn\u2019t deny the presence of homosexual undertones between the two. But it\u2019s pretty hard to convince yourself so because there were plenty of homophobic undertones woven in the show as well (most of them were related to how the characters portray being gay = disgusting). So, really, just interpret Ash & Eiji\u2019s relationship just like how you treat Yuri & Victor\u2019s: whichever suits your narrative and with a grain of salt. All I know is that I share Ash\u2019s feelings of comfort & relief whenever I see the two just laying low in each other\u2019s company and being safe in general (yea, I\u2019m talking about those domestic scenes). They were probably the only times during the whole course of the story where I felt that temporary \u2018everything is gonna be alright\u2019 moment and wasn\u2019t in the edge of my seat.\\n\\n\r\n[Animation & Art: 9]\\n\\n\r\nI personally think that the studio did a lot of great stylistic decisions for a 1985 manga adaptation. Instead of blatantly copy-pasteing the art style just for the sake of preservation (I\u2019m winking at you, Sailor Moon Crystal), they only adapted the major lineart of the characters and \u2018modernizing\u2019 it from there. As a result, you get a modern quality show off a 1985 work that\u2019s still able to retain the retro feel thanks to the character designs, fashion styles, and the way the setting was drawn.\\n\\n\r\nMore specifically about character designs, they\u2019re +++++. Everyone\u2019s distinct without trying to make them caricature-like. Even minor characters have special features that differentiate each other and it\u2019s apparent that the staffs put extra attention to every characters\u2019 details.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, no critique for the art/animation in general. But since nothing is really \u2018ground-breaking\u2019, I won\u2019t give it a 10.\\n\\n\r\n[Sound: 9]\\n\\n\r\nThis is the second time ever (MDZS was the first) that I noticed the uniqueness of SFXs & OSTs in an anime (granted, I need to watch even more anime first but this is still an anomaly). The OSTs were very thematic. Some action/dodgy parts sounded cool & retro and some more emotional parts were backed with a classical piece that wasn\u2019t overly dramatic. They were also carefully and cleverly placed. I noticed during some emotional scenes, the OST was purposefully removed and they actually made the scene more powerful because they felt real instead of romanticized.\\n\\n\r\nAnother event of careful placement was during the scene where Eiji teaches \u2018sayonara\u2019 to Ash. The ending song slowly bled through the scene and the lyrics were heard clearly: \u2018Would I still have the chance for us to say goodbye?\u2019 and I think the timing was just pure brilliance. The overall lyrics in all the OP & ED actually suit Ash\u2019s feelings and emotions so well. I don\u2019t know if they were written like that on purpose or not, but I really appreciate it.\\n\\n\r\n[Overall Enjoyment: 10]\\n\\n\r\nI initially watched Banana Fish for its fanservice, but I stayed for everything else because simply reducing this show to a material to fangirl to is a huge disservice. Even if I meant to treat it like such, I wouldn\u2019t be able to do it because the plot and characters would just suck me in and made me forgot to fangirl anyway.\\n\\n\r\nWithout spoiling anything, I think the ending (I\u2019m talking about the general ending here, not focusing on what happened with one/two characters only) didn\u2019t come off pretentiously edgy; or at least it didn\u2019t feel like it. Even if it does though, the ending was written & directed very beautifully to the point that we felt as if everything happened very naturally. It didn\u2019t run away from what the whole show was built upon, but it also encompasses the little positive things that gear all the characters forward throughout the show: love and freedom.\\n\\n\r\nI finished the whole thing feeling overwhelmed and full (and yeah I did shed some tears).\\n\\n\r\n[Average Score]\\n\\n\r\n47/5 = 9.4\\n\r\nRounded to 9",

            "content": "SPOILER----\r\nI have never felt so anxious waiting for an episode, ever. After episode 22, I knew it was all about to end and it was getting more and more sad by the minute. Watching a character evolving the way Eiji and Ash did, and watching their relationship grow in a world with such savage environments, I grew to love those two, so much. Every moment they had together made me feel all warm and fuzzy. I admit, I didn't watch the anime from the first episode, but from after episode 7 had just been aired. I saw a thumbnail on youtube with the scene ofAsh kissing Eiji, that made me want to try watching the anime in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nI was very very sceptical thinking \"Man I don't like the art, it's so different from the anime art I know\" but I quickly learned to accept that, and in time, I started to love the art.\\n\\n\r\nIt was realistic in the way that the characters eyes were more or less, a normal size, which I don't see often in anime these days.\\n\\n\r\nGetting to know each character and their names wasn't as confusing as I thought it would be, Ash and Eiji were unique names that I never knew of, back then. The way I was able to recognise Ash's name was each time a character in the anime said his name. \"Asshu\" which each time reminded me of \"achoo\" as in a sneeze. That fact, made me say \"bless you\" out loud, each time someone said Ash's name.\\n\\n\r\nAfter Ash's fight with Arthur, he was brought to the hospital. After that episode I was just so curious about what would happen next, and so, I read the manga. And I'm stating that I'm not a good reader but it seems like a manga with pictures and short texts, made things easier for me. I was getting more and more into the manga so I continued. Suddenly, I was watching Eiji and Ibe leaving N.Y again, and Ash was reading the letter from Eiji. When I saw that Ash let his guard down I was thinking \"Ah he's been stabbed dozens of times, he'll get it fixed\" But did he though? Did he actually get it fixed? Why didn't he?\\n\\n\r\nFrom that moment I prayed that the anime wouldn't turn out like the manga did because that would be even more painful, watching the character I love, sitting there with blood and tears all over the letter.\\n\\n\r\nAs the anime continued, I was quickly learning that \"Oh wow.. They're going for the manga..\" due to how precise and familiar each scene was. But that didn't stop me from looking forward to each episode, I couldn't wait, each day was so long but the episode, so short. It felt like I was getting so obsessed with the anime that nothing else really mattered but getting through the week to watch the next episode. That was nothing new for me, getting obsessed with something and wanting to praise it like I would God until it's over.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough, after episode 22, I didn't look forward to the next episodes no more, I knew what was coming. I knew I was gonna bawl, I knew I'd need buckets for my tears. I've fallen completely in love with Ash and his beautiful person. And fallen even more in love with his relationship with Eiji, each bromance moment got me all excited and it was such a nice feeling.\\n\\n\r\nThat relationship is the most beautiful thing I've seen, ever. I didn't know that an anime could be this touching to someone like me. And especially when I think about how sceptical I was when watching the first episodes of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nAsh fascinated me on so many points. A beautiful young man with the mind of a supercomputer, fangs and claws as sharp as a knife, and at first, a cold blooded killer who showed no emotion nor remorse.\\n\\n\r\nEiji, the other main character, just about a young year older than Ash, is a peaceful and observant person, whose aura could affect even the most cold blooded killer. That peaceful and carefree, cheerful and always smiling person, affected Ash in so many ways. That's so beautiful. I can't describe it any better than 'beautiful'.\\n\\n\r\nAt first, I really disliked the villains, especially Yut, for kidnapping Eiji like he did, and forcing Shorter to do the work of betraying Ash. But the worst thing was when he ordered some of Sing's gang members to attack Ash and Eiji when they were alone together. Yut knew that Ash wasn't on guard when he was with Eiji and therefore stated that it was the perfect chance to attack. I started asking myself \"Is Yut really a villain?\" His reason for going after Eiji was because Ash found love, despite having such a brutal upgrowing like Yut himself did. Although, Yut remained alone. Blanca stated that he had to learn how to love others, in order to be loved. I believe that's true. At first I even thought of Blanca as a villain but that quickly changed, due to his soft spot when it comes to Ash.\\n\\n\r\nWithout a second thought, Eiji took the bullet instead of Ash. Literally. As Eiji was just laying there, bleeding heavily, his only thoughts were \"Is Ash okay?\"\\n\\n\r\nTo think that those two would, without a second thought, give away their everything for each other in a heartbeat. What could possibly make a relationship more pure and beautiful than this?\\n\\n\r\nAsh deep down knew how it was gonna turn out in the end, but needed someone by his side as \"mental backup\" as I call it, in order to keep on moving forward.\\n\\n\r\nFor the first time, Ash felt warmth. He had the feeling of being loved. The feeling of not being indebted. It never stroke Eiji that he would need Ash to do something in return if Eiji did Ash a favour.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime made me realise that the story isn't far from the world we live in. The world is savage, brutal but beautiful. Watching the anime as it was being aired has been one of my happiest moments. Watching a relationship like Ash and Eiji's, really just impressed me in every single way, and I don't get easily impressed. I have watched a LOT of anime over the years and I knew as this anime was airing, it was taking the place on my top 3 favourite anime list.\\n\\n\r\nI don't think I'll ever be able to cope with how things turned out in the last episode, never have I ever felt such an ache in the chest from an anime. No, not just an anime, overall, series, movies. In the manga, Ash died. But did he really die in the anime? I don't know anymore. I was sure that he did but after being told that this might not have been the case, I feel a bit better. I needed to get all this out, while typing this, I was bawling. I can't get over this heartbreaking story.\\n\\n\r\nSome people say that Ash gave up because he finally found love. But I'm just thinking.. Isn't that one more reason to live? Living for the one he loves?\\n\\n\r\nEiji's impact on Ash impressed me by a ton. It's so amazing, watching these two guys changing with each episode.\\n\\n\r\nI'm glad the side novels didn't take part in these 24 episodes, as they state that Ash is dead. So I still feel like there's hope somewhere.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway I just needed to get this out.\\n\\n\r\nWatching this anime was one of the most amazing journeys I've ever been on. Thank you for creating such a painful, yet beautiful masterpiece.",

I have never even binge watched something so quick but uhh here we are, 20 episodes seen and craving for more. I'm recommending everyone to do the same - to drop the prejudices like \"thE NaMe iS WEirD iS this fOR kiDs???oR about cooking?? eating???hm\" and just welcome the pain! ! :\uff65\uff9f\u2606\u2727\r\nMy English and especially the lack of adjectives would make a longer review awkward, so I'm saying it quickly and once only so uhhh listen,, watch this anime.\r\nThe best part, also known as the plot,is thrilling and makes you want to see more. The characters are wonderfully written (things that happen to them make you feel things too! wow!) And I'm living for the differences between the main characters, Ash and Eiji. Beeeeautiful.\\n\\n\r\nBonus points for the music! I often skip openings and endings but I don't think I did it even once with Banana Fish? The songs are just,, really my taste. Best of the year - at least. Voice acting is also on point, especially Ash's VA is really fitting for him in my opinion!\\n\\n\r\nArt is very pleasing. It has a recognizable 80's vibe which I love.

            "content": "Amazing! That's a good word to sum up Banana Fish. At first glance, I was a little afraid to watch the anime, mainly because I have read many comments saying that it was a completely \"gay\" anime. However, after watching the first 3 episodes, I\u2019ve realized that this is an unfair comment and is by the way very prejudiced.\r\nIf you are a person who in hypothesis none admits the \"homosexual\" topic in an anime, Banana Fish is not for you. However, let's be clear: this is not the focus of the anime, much less the main theme.\r\nI was struck by the primacy that such heavyand profound themes are treated. At some point, I did not know if I should cry together with Ash, or should be angry with the situation. This anime really messed with my feelings and with my psychological. In fact, it is a rather heavy anime psychological. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the strengths for me is the soundtrack. The opening song is amazing; this music is very good, of those that stay all day in the mind. I really loved it! The art goes back to the 80's, when the manga was written. At first the design may seem strange but considered the time, it fit very well in context. In addition, depicting the city of NY in small details such as graffiti on walls, buildings, stairs, alleys and bars in basements, makes you feel very much inside the atmosphere of the city in the 80's.\\n\\n\r\nAnother good point is how the anime really demonstrates the humanity of the characters. They are not mere anime characters. For me, few animes had this ability to express what the characters are feeling, causing in us empathy, getting very close to reality, manly in moments of suffering. I suffered a lot along with the characters!\\n\\n\r\nIt's worth watching. I'm already sad because it\u2019s close to the end. \\n\r\nI piece of advice: don\u2019t be led by negative comments! Just like I did, just watch the anime and draw your own conclusions!\\n",

            "content": "*Hi, my reviews are bad and my English isn't good! ^_^ just a heads up! \r\nHonestly, I've watched a ton of anime, and that isn't saying much since many of us fans have. Banana Fish, for me, was one of those rare shows that I know for a fact will stick with me for a long time, emotionally. The only reason I brought up the amount of shows that I've watched is to say that maybe 5 or 6 have gotten me SO emotionally invested, and I don't even know why.\r\nI knew I was in for something a bit tragic, from episode one I wasgetting these 'Zankyou no Terror' vibes, maybe since these are both from Mappa.\\n\r\nZankyou no Terror had me upset for weeks, leaving me with a giant hole in my heart, Banana Fish did me even worse. I don't think I'm ever going to get over how upset I am currently, having just finished it. This is the sort of show that I almost want to make my friends watch so we can all cry together and talk about how fucking amazing it was. This show filled my soul, I was satisfied watching all 24 episodes and felt it was a solid show, yet it ripped my heart and my emotions to bits, this shit is TRAUMATIZING.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST was pretty good, but it didn't especially stick in my brain or anything, the ED's on the other hand, for gods sake I finish the show- and then i'm like 'oh boy the first ED was a real uhh banger maybe it will cheer me up' Yeah um, no. That was stupid of me to think and now I'm in a deadly state of severe dehydration and my salty ass tears are going to ruin my skin. \\n\\n\r\nI really liked the animation and art, it was a nice style that really brought out the characters, like Eiji looking quite bland, especially in comparison to Ash (them eyes). For the animation, it was good quality, with not much or not to much noticeable CG (cough p5a cough) which makes me happy, since there is nothing more distracting than crappy crowd CG\\n\\n\r\nI know i'm not supposed to point these things out, I see some people complaining about the fact that basically everyone is completely infatuated with Ash in the show, but It never really annoyed me, knowing the place that Ash grew up and the people he was around or the line of work he was in, it (disgustingly) makes sense.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not here to look through the flaws of 'Banana Fish'. I was probably to absorbed and completely obsessed with it to even be able to point things out, and I don't plan on going back to find flaws. Every good, great and amazing show has flaws, but no matter how many, if your willing to overlook them because a show is 'THAT GOOD' just means it was enjoyable and investing. For me, that is an extremely important part of any good show or anime or even story, being so emotionally invested in a show that you are willing to completely overlook it's flaws. Banana Fish really did that for me, and I regret not watching it sooner (though it may have been to painful to simulcast). \\n\\n\r\nI'd give this show a high eight or possibly even a nine, but when it comes to how much I enjoyed watching every. last. second. of this show, I'd give it a 10 out of pure favoritism. It's taken 4 years for an anime to sit next to Zankyou no terror (I will now shut up about it) They gave me similar vibes, and Banana Fish is resonating with me, I don't think I'll ever be able to make these feelings go away (why does this all of a sudden sound like a confession?)\\n\\n",

Criminal minds, criminal plans and criminal mysteries. Despite how unique he is, it's always possible to see yourself in him. When he does the wrong thing for the right reason, and doesn't explain why to anyone, choosing instead to let them hate him.\r\nWhen he can't decide where his heart belongs, or whether he should live the life he wants or the one he feels he deserves. Ash, a brilliantly skilled, unpredictable misfitwho knows everything but who he is, is faced with the one thing he could never have: innocence.\\n\\n\r\nTo watch his character develop is like watching a leopard grow: acts on instinct, fights to survive. Ash isn't a villain, despite what he does. He just chooses to do the right thing only when he decides he wants to, which you would think is selfish, but in reality, it's what all of us are like. Ash just does it with less hesitation, choosing to do now and fix later.\\n\\n\r\nAsh's relationship with Eiji Okumura is the purest form of love you'll ever see. A broken soul is conflicted with another that wants to repair it.\\n\\n\r\nDon't be fooled by the playful name. 'Banana Fish' is a war zone where even you won't survive.\\n\\n\r\nI could easily say this is the greatest show I have ever seen. It will be for some time. A beautiful selection of memorable and emotional music, animation that pleases the eye, voices that speak into your soul, a plot with perfect pacing and an array of characters who will connect with you however they can.\\n\\n\r\nBanana Fish is a masterpiece.",

            "content": "Story: 9\r\nBanana Fish is a beautiful story about the adventures of a New York gangster with a dark past named, Ash Lynx, and a Japanese boy visiting America who gets caught up in it, Eiji Okumura. The story starts with 2 things first a flash back scene in the middle east where a soldier kills his comrades and then gets shot in the legs. Second largely with Ash being portrayed as a real tough gangster who is controlling the streets on behalf of the local mafia. However, this sort of story quickly takes a turn into something else, Ash Lynx ends being the little brotherof the guy who went insane in the Iraq and believes Golzine the leader of the mafia is responsible so he betrays them and steals a drug called Banana Fish. From this point on the main characters get wrapped up in a huge conspiracy involving congress men, the military, and a large criminal syndicate, and Ash Lynx with his gang and Eiji try to uncover the truth and expose Golzine. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime was largely faithful to the source material and did not change all that much, although they did not keep the era the series took place in, it covered the original work well enough. In fact I personally love the atmosphere of New York and the modern interpretation of the series, instead of Vietnam they used a more current war, and they represented current american demographics a lot better. They also changed a few characters backstories to make them more current for example the former Russian agent is now a former Russian special forces member and such. Overall though they kept it faithful to the source material and it was an amazing ride.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is smooth and clean, there were no major problems with it, the fight choreography was pretty beautiful as well and the character design, which really suits the manga version of the characters. The background art for the city was beautifully done, it seems like some of the animators have actually been to New York or at least looked at street views of the city. The weapons in the show could have been done a bit better, and the series decided not to show the aftermath of a lot of the more violent scenes but that's alright the show was aiming to be dark not edgy.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe openings were absolutely amazing some of the best of 2018, both were great songs, the sound track for the fight scenes and whenever Golzine showed up were very good and livened up the show. I love how the OP songs and the main story were connected really well, and the use of lighter music and background sounds when the characters were doing more slice of life things helped give some relief in a fairly dark show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe character development between Ash and Eiji were pretty amazing, Ash starts off being really isolated and closed to the world due to past trauma however with Eiji he beings feeling more human and even able to love like a normal person. Its important to note however, if you are coming into this anime expecting a boys love show, you're going to be disappointed. Although its almost certain Ash is bisexual, Eiji and Ash do not have a romantic life together, the story is primarily focused on the main plot involving Banana Fish, and although Eiji really cares about Ash I dont think hes romantically interested, its closer to brotherly love if anything.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this series, its one of my top 5 for this year, and its definitely one of the top 24 episode shows we have had, I believe if you enjoy animes with gangs, street fighting, interesting plot twists, strong but flawed main characters, and a dark atmosphere, then this show is for you.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\\n\r\nI give this show an 8, it was really hard deciding whether or not to give this show an 8 or 9 since it was very close, however I will give it an 8 for 2 reasons. One because although the story was great it relied way to much on Ash or Eiji being kidnapped to move the plot forward, felt like this was a Nintendo game and they princesses. Second because the ending was a little rushed and they couldn't fit in everything important, and had to rush some fights. However it is still a very strong show and definitely a top 5 of 2018.\\n",

One minute a guy is holding a knife, the next minute he's best friends with his hostage and now has a handgun.\r\nA lot of gay rape is implied throughout the skippy story.\r\nPlot is weak\r\nSetting is nice and I like the ending song.  Gangs of New York is a really interesting setting.  Animations outdated, but isn't distracting since I thiiiink it takes place before or around the 2000s?  Character developement is horrible.  Main character begins as a somewhat tough guy.... but endsup being a gay dude who's as dumb as brick.  The show is filled with \"hostage bluffing\" and the annoying gunpoint.\\n\r\nCharacters aren't diverse, all are literally homosexuals who are all still in the closet.  I think 75% of the chracters are gay and all want to have sex with Ash.  \\n\r\nAlso moves too slow.... usually a high rated series will have a lot of development and progress made over time: in this case you will see this common trope:\\n\r\ngood guys try to fight fair.  bad guys break rules.  Good guys get tortured or killed.  And it is at this moment that the good guys give you the \"I knew how to deal with this all along!\"  To me, I interpret this as a waste of chracter's deaths and worthless torture \\n\r\nSpoilers:  good guys get raped and tortured for no reason and sometimes with consent.  Then it turned out Ash had a plan hidden in his sleeves the whole time (which he could have used earlier before the rape and torture).  Pretty irritating how stupid our protaganist is when he's made out to be a one step ahead personality.  Ash is a really dumb fool.",

The best finding of the year for me, which doesn\u2019t mean that I think it\u2019s the best series of the year or something like that, but my love at first sight with it was just too strong, and love is something you can\u2019t really disprove in words, right? :)",

            "content": "It is hard to explain how surprised I was by how much I loved this anime.  A shoujo drama with overarching romance?  Eh, not normally my cup of tea.  But then I started watching Banana Fish and this is not a generic shoujo drama with an overarching romance.  This is so much more... \r\nThe first episode of Banana Fish immediately engages you into the more action crime thriller sides of the show which immediately hooked me.  Growing up watching martial arts movies and crime shows with my father, the beginning of this show felt more action oriented than what I\u2019dexpect out of a shoujo anime.  You immediately meet some of the most engaging and well developed characters I\u2019ve seen in a long time who captivated you so quickly that at the end of the first episode when major traumatic drama occurs, you immediately feel that empathetic bond that normally takes a normal series multiple episodes to develop. \\n\r\nThis show has so much to offer from it\u2019s adventure crime aspects that lead you through major crime lord mobsters to an overarching mystery that keeps you on edge to a surprisingly well developed romance between the two leads.  I\u2019m not one to truly enjoy watching romances, but the delicate care taken to developing this relationship was so beautiful that you couldn\u2019t help but love them.  It never felt like a sexually charged attention grabbing romance, but a real and tangible relationship you just want to support. \\n\r\nThere were only a few downsides I noted throughout this anime.  For one there was once or twice I noticed the CGI looking unnatural, however for every time it seemingly seemed unnatural, there were 10 more times the anime was stunning and breathtaking.  I also had issues with the lack of female characters in the show.  Now I\u2019m not one to say that all shows must have a token female character.  I\u2019d rather no females than a cheap characterized female that detracts from the story.  On the flip side, an anime set in modern New York City seemed odd only having one or two very background and minor female roles.  With that said, I do understand the original source manga was set in the 1980s where the lack of female characters makes more sense.  \\n\r\nDo be warned however, this show hurts so much in the end.  I became so engaged in the characters and fell in love with each of them to such a degree that I mourned them for weeks at the end of the show.  If you\u2019re not looking for an emotion jerker, perhaps overlook this anime.  With it\u2019s beautiful animation, wonderful characters, and one of the best intros in anime using Blue Encount\u2019s Freedon, if you\u2019re looking for an anime carefully crafted into a masterpiece, this one is one for sure.\\n\r\nIf you have any opinions on this anime, please let me know.  I\u2019ll be happy to hear what other people think and what criticisms or beautiful aspects you might have noticed that I missed.",

I believe this is because people wrote it off because it featured elements of homosexual relationships and people are just... dumb? Like sure thing Chad, you didn't like Banana Fish because it was too 'edgy' but your favourite anime is Akame Ga Kill, go off.\r\nI liked Banana Fish because it has great action direction despite notbeing an action anime, beautiful art, amazing characters, awesome OST and was a lot of fun to watch. \\n\r\nI didn't like that it was a huge tearjerker, but I suppose that's what you should expect from the get-go with themes such as rape, human experiments and prostitution. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Banana Fish isn't yaoi bait man-service, you're just immature.",

            "content": "story - 9/10\r\nthe story of banana fish is good. it's a little convoluted, and a lot to deal with at times, but all-in-all, it wouldn't be the story it is without these elements. the intricate relationships between the gangs of new york, the corruption of the american government, the abuse faced by the protagonist, these all make up the world of banana fish, and make for a very compelling story. \r\nwe navigate this world from the perspective of two very different boys. one, ash lynx, an american boy only 17, and already a gang boss. the other, eiji okumura, a japanese tourist, 19. \r\neiji travelsto the states as the assistant to a photographer doing a journalistic piece on american gangs, which introduces him to ash. despite ash's best efforts, eiji- and the other allies he makes along the way- becomes entangled in the gang conflict more than any of them could've imagined.\\n\\n\r\nart - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nthe art style of banana fish is one of my favorite things about it. the overall look of the characters to me, is \"cute\" in a way. this is in huge contrast to the story itself. the settings and character designs themselves are beautiful when they standalone as well. bonus points for the characters' fashion sense. the only thing i could be nitpicky about here, is some of the between frames could get a little sloppy. \\n\\n\r\nsound - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nsound often gets overlooked, but banana fish reminded me of just how important it can be to the tone of the anime. the ops and eds are wonderful in their own right, but the score itself and the way it's interwoven into the story really add another layer.\\n\\n\r\ncharacter - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nthese characters are very multi-dimensional. ash is a genius, a hardened gang leader, but he is also a 17 year old boy who has been through a lot of emotional turmoil. you see this peek its way out from behind his tough facade in many ways, eg. latching onto eiji. the relationship between eiji and ash was the biggest draw to this story for me. they care about each other so much, despite their wild differences, and would do anything for the other. \\n\\n\r\nenjoyment - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nthe parts that i enjoyed, i enjoyed greatly. however, there are some darker themes at play here with this subject matter, obviously. the abuse, the rape, the murder. these aren't what i would call enjoyable usually, and while i found most of it to be integral to the story, it could take away from the overall enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\noverall - 10/10\\n\\n\r\ni haven't enjoyed a new anime as much as this one in a long, long time. will be delving into the manga now",

            "content": "I actually decided to drop this anime when it first came out and the reason I is because of the tittle itself (I felt the tittle sound stupid \"Banana Fish\") & the drawing does not interests me. Now is Fall Anime 2018 season & there is not much anime that interest me so I decided to watch Summer 2018 anime that I have drop by looking at others review. When I look at the review for this anime, I decided to give it a try because this anime scores quite high. OMG! I almost missed out this masterpiece.\r\nA very well written story with unpredictable plot.I like the fact that it makes me feel thrilling when watching it which I have not felt this way for a long time when watching anime (the more episodes I watch, the more thrilling it gets). Not to mention, every episode ended with cliffhanger. On top of that, I don't cry easily for an anime but this anime really hits me hard. I never felt sad, depressed & emotional for an anime for a long time.\\n\\n\r\nBesides that, the pacing for the anime is fantastic (it's not so fast and it not slow. Something not many anime nowadays have nailed it).I also like that the story have touch heavy topics like child trafficking, rape, sex slave etc which is a topic not many story is brave enough to talk about despite this stuff is still happening in our world.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack in this anime is amazing as well even though it might not be memorable as other anime. As for the both OP, I think is ok but the both ED is great especially ED 1. ED 1 fits perfectly for this anime & the character, Ash. ED 1 just makes me feel sad for Ash & feel likes I can hear him scream for help. As for ED 2, somehow it makes me sad & it give me chills when the song plays. The anime is not ending yet & I wish for a happy ending since Ash has been through a lot in his childhood & I want to see him happy but for some reason, the ED 2 makes me feel uneasy about the anime ending.\\n\\n\r\nI am really regret that almost drop this masterpiece but I am glad that I have given this anime a chance. I should not have judge the book by it's cover.",

            "content": "Banana fish is actually a TV series that I enjoyed which is outside of my usual anime preferences. Flow of story with numerous twists and turns along the way that ignites the curiosity and temptation of the viewer; should be praised.\r\nThe story itself was notable with it's distribution and synchronization of characters, despite the fact that the show ended with distinguishable traits of a tragedy. That must be because of the original lay out of the manga which the series is based on; but still I oneself wish for a better ending that will in a way sort of serves justice to the characters forwhat they've been put through throughout the entire show. \\n\r\nIn my opinion an animation which is based on a previous graphical novel or any other work of literature; isn't obligated to strictly follow the same script as of it's origin text; if done also limits the series's potentiality to become independent and follow a path of it's own creative making while still keeping a touch of it's predecessor.\\n\r\nEven though the series consisted of strong willed, dynamic characters, I still find myself to be quite confused when trying to grasp the true relationship between the banana fish's core characters; Ash and Eiji. It's true that friendship bonds can take many forms; but as person a who is contributing to this review after watching the show to it's completion; I'm quite sure the creators's intention solely was not to convey the deep brotherly bond that Ash and Eiji shares... So I find the lack of certitude also to be a scored negative point.\\n\r\nApart from those few inconveniences I still find and believe Banana fish to be one of the best anime TV series made in the year 2018.       \\n\r\n[+ This is my first animelist review ;p ;p ]",

In actuality, the title is a reference to the short story \"A Perfect Day for Bananafish\" by J.D. Salinger. Thankfully, I finally picked up this anime, after it has finished airing.\r\nYou are given two beautiful characters from the very beginning, two people who are completely different from one another. However, \"opposites attract,\" and as the show progresses, you can see how the characters change to be more like each other. The two personalities,no matter how different, blend so perfectly. The result is heartwarming yet heartwrenching as forces try to pull the two apart.\\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend \"Banana Fish.\" Coming from a New Yorker, I love how \"Banana Fish\" accurately depict the City of New York. I loved spotting places that I recognized. In addition, I loved the story and characters that make up the show. Give \"Banana Fish\" a try, but beware of how sad it can be.",

Ash has a really strong hitting backstory that does back up his reasoning for his hatred towards certain people. The character development is on point. Ash turns from a ruthless killer to learning how to love, while Eiji turns from a shy and quite person to a some what tough and brave hero. However, this show isn't perfect. I swear to god all the bad guys are storm troopers who can't aim forlife, and to be honest, Ash should be dead so many times but he just does die... That man is tough as hell. But on the good side, the art is beautiful and the character models are really on point. This anime is full of feels, action, and love... hehe... Well, have fun binging. \\n\\n\r\n- Spacecraft555 UwU",

            "content": "Without a doubt my new favourite anime series - I knew it would be so from the very first episode and I was not disappointed. Never have I cried so much, felt so much for the characters or been so as completely engrossed by a television series. MAPPA has yet again created another masterpiece.\r\nStory (10): In one word - INTENSE. This show is not for the fainthearted. Every time you think that the things cannot get any worse for the characters, something terrible happens that leaves you on the edge of your seat unable to stand the wait between episodes. There was never a lagin the story and the story was in no way predictable. It was not all sadness and doom - there were truly funny and heartwarming moments too to endear you to each of the characters before tragedy struck. It is a story I could watch again and again without becoming bored, each time finding new details and every time being rendered as emotionally scarred as the last. \\n\\n\r\nArt (9): the art style is modern compared to the manga, which is not a bad thing. It fitted the tone of the story well.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10): the voice actors are great and the the opening and I love the opening and closing songs. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (10): The characters are incredible. Being 24 episodes in length allowed for deep development of every character. There were no mundane characters - every character had their own unique personality, their own (often troubled) past and their own desires and wants. Character development in Banana Fish excels that of every television show I have watched before (anime and non-anime shows alike). \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10): Every episode leaves you wanting more. I laughed. I cried. I throughly enjoyed this show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (10): At the risk of repeating myself, I give very few anime shows a 10 but this show is truly a masterpiece. When my heart finally heals from the emotional trauma, I will be watching it again.\\n\\n",

            "content": "WARNING, THIS REVIEW IS LONG O--0\r\nBanana Fish \u2026..wow\u2026.\r\nBanana Fish has a lot going on,but the main meat of the story is that this gang leader named Asher meets this Foreign Japanese boy named Edgy and there are some serious things going on,but from the title of the show it's premise is Asher figuring out wtf is A Banana Fish and while doing so, he has to deal with rival gangs,mobsters, politics, his family, and Edgy all at the same time.That's only for the first half, but anyway.Things that I like: the actual story of Banana Fish played out very well, the things that I didn'tlike is the pacing.The show moves at such a quick pace that even the moments that have nothing happening still feels rushed.Around the middle of the show is where it becomes more apparent, but luckily the neck break pace of the show gets resolved really quickly.The show kinda leans into the homosexual perspective without being pandering.Sometimes it\u2019s for comedic effect but heads up just in case you can\u2019t handle it. And if you can\u2019t, what are you, CHICKEN? XD Oh and um, this show can get a little triggering.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nMy thoughts on the extreme nature of Banana Fish\\n\r\nAlso, I don\u2019t know if this the right time to say this, but this show has a lot, \\n\r\nAnd i mean a lot of mature content that people usually take or leave:rape, child prostitution,the whole nine yards. It\u2019s one of those super gritty shows that stands out from the rest because of the taboo nature.After one scene in particular, I realized this show is not a run of the mill action, but it is a complete DRAMA. BUT what separates this from being something completely distasteful, is how these themes are handled. They are not there because lol, they are there to put how much weight and roughness the characters had and still have to deal with . At first, I thought there was a bit too much of it, but then I realized that without these terrible acts, but I realized that Banana Fish is trying to portray life and if you can\u2019t tell, life is not as black and white as everyone thinks it is.It\u2019s super repulsive and unimaginable at times, and I can appreciate how the show handles it. They don\u2019t tell you the details, and they don\u2019t go full Boku no Pico on you. If anything it\u2019s smack dab in the middle and when these things are brought up it makes you lose humanity, but it also gives you the outlook that Asher goes through which is a good thing. OKAY moving on..\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was done by MAPPA yay. I love MAPPA as a studio but I always see them trying to go beyond their limits and most of the time it ends up out of their favor, and by that I mean THEIR 3D SUCKS MOST OF THE TIME BUT THEY LOOOVE TO USE IT CONSTANTLY. But actually, MAPPA decided to do something smart and make the small amount of 3d barely visible.There was never a single time I recall anything in the foreground being 3D and when you do notice out of the corner of your eye, it actually looks sorta good.They still have a looong way to go before making bearable 3D. 2D and 3D are so hard to put together anyways.The animation of the show is actually standard fare for MAPPA. They start out strong, flub up in a little in the middle and finish strong.The actual background design is really gorgeous as well. Despite the dark nature of Banana Fish, the actual coloring is super lively and bright depending on certain areas and super dark during others.The character designs are super nostalgic(probably because this is based of a manga from the 90\u2019s) But i thought it worked well.\\n\r\nAlso one thing that I just couldn\u2019t ignore was how much work was put in to translating everything in English. This show takes place in America so there is English,A lot of it.From entire websites, news articles, and magazines, in full English. And it\u2019s fine for the most part, but others are just a bit too goofy. My favorite example is \u201cHe was destroyed in a car accident\u201d lol\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe soundtrack hits the gangster feeling home,but I didn\u2019t really care for it that much.It just all comes down to taste.Don\u2019t get me wrong it still sounds better than trap beats and is still good.If that\u2019s your thing knock yourself out.On the other hand, my absolute favorite parts of the soundtracks are the ones that distort the music.Purposely stalling audio, having very macabre drones, and even the emotional soundtracks got to me. I absolutely adore this track despite my distaste for hip hop but to each his own. You know what else I absolutely love??? The second opening, full of raw emotion and charming yet  awkward lyrics, and I'll admit it, it's  one of my favorite opening ever.The VA was top notch, but THIS SHOW NEEDS A DUB LIKE PRONTO.If these characters were not speaking Japanese, you would not be able to tell that this was made in Japan. Despite the great performances,I feel like the script was sort of vague on how actual american slang works, and a dub would do the job nicely. I want this dub to be the most explicit,raunchy, american dialect filled dub this side of Black Lagoon and I would give an arm to see it happen.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll talk about Edgy first because he is my favorite.(I know his name is Eiji but every time someone said his name it sounded like \u201cEdgy\u201d which is ironic because he is the most harmless person in the show.I relate to him the most.Helpless and vulnerable but still have fun in the face of death.What I like about him is that he doesn\u2019t talk most of the time.he does a lot in this show for a weak little Asian boy.The best thing this show did with him is make him so likable ,but at the same time put him into more dangerous and life threatening situations.And the only thing keeping hIm into this crime life is his relationship with Asher and that is something wonderful to behold.Asher himself,I had an extremely hard time liking because he had so many things about him that screamed \u201cMary Sue\u201d being badass and sly , but having a very dark past.Little did I realize that the \u201cdark past\u201d  part comes to bite him in the butt,figuratively and literally.And he ends up going through a lot of development thanks to Edgy.Seriously they start acting like a couple and it is very adorable, these two develop so much together that they even do so when their lives are in danger, which can get random at times, but more or less these two have amazing chemistry.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters in the show are hard to talk about because they pop up here and there so i\u2019ll split it up in two categories(i told you this review would be long)\\n\\n\r\nThe good people\\n\r\nAsher and Edgy have some companions with them and i love them so much.One character gave me flashbacks to Grimmer from Monster, and the others despite having not a lot of background, still are good characters with personality that you don\u2019t wanna see hurt. And you do see them hurt and you cry buckets for the rest of the episode. Don\u2019t worry, it doesn\u2019t go to Devilman Crybaby levels of character deaths, but when they hit they hit HARD.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe bad people and all in between.\\n\r\nThere are sooo many villains in this show it\u2019s ridiculous There are good villains, bad villains, good villains that turn bad, bad villains that turn good, but are still bad, stupid villains, people that are not villains, but just dumb and selfish, villains that don\u2019t do anything really, and the big kahuna of them all.The main villain, Dino. This guy is an awful person and that\u2019s what makes him a good villain.He doesn\u2019t appear a lot, but every time he does, he just shocks you to your core.He is not the type of person to just kill you and that\u2019s it. He gets in your mind and is a prime example of just how repulsive the world can be most times.All the others I just put them into the mold of that\u2019s a bad guy so I hate him,Unless, they help Ash in some way or don\u2019t completely pursue against him, they are all just the same .As in they are dirty, awful people and deserve to be in hell.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I should probably mention is the ending.I just don\u2019t know how I feel about it. I was emotionally unstable after the final episode and was rolling on the floor crying.This ending was like watching Clannad,but three times worse. Without spoiling it. It\u2019s like you are on a interstate bridge and the road is very icy and then Episode 24 comes and the entire bridge just collapsed before  you were about to get off of it. I did not realize until those final moments how attached I got to those characters and the way the show just takes my heart and rips it out and just stomps on it in front of my eyes was just not cool but beautiful at the same time.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis show was something for sure.I would not recommend it as something someone who likes mindless action would watch, but I love it to death, I still don\u2019t consider it a masterpiece because there are some problems here and there, but I can\u2019t recommend it enough,there were times I had to force myself to take a break before marathoning the whole thing, I just couldn\u2019t get enough. just don\u2019t bring your children or parents with you.Also that ending, I could not sleep at night after it so yeah.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-8\\n\\n\r\nI did not realize until now, that I have been say Asher when the mc's name is actually Ash. I'm so embarrassed T__T",

            "content": "There was a person that was ignoring everyone, that was wandering around and deceived everything but then a person appeared in his life and made him realize how good can life be. \r\nThose words describe the story of Banana Fish as well as it could ever be done. We're reaching a point of ectsay while watching this gem of an anime that cannot be possibly expressed with words but only with the atmosphere that it gives you. This is an adaptation of the manga Banana Fish that was published in 1985 and while the story of the manga is based on the \"80's\" this faithfuladaptation takes everything it has to give and becomes even more relatable basing it in today's day and age. \\n\\n\r\nThe atmosphere felt in this anime was one that tells you how while life can be an inmense burden and an indescriptible pain it could also be the most beautiful thing you could ever have. \\n\\n\r\nThere are times of pain, there are times of grief, there are times of tears, there are times of despair but that is only a part of the picture because there are also times of joy, there are times of happiness, there are times of laughter, there are times that can be enjoyed more than anything in this world and only say \"how good is to be alive\". \\n\\n\r\nBanana Fish is an experience that gives you impotence and despair but also gives you laughs and joy, it has everything that could possibly be asked of a series with it's story and design. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is based around a guy by the name Ash Claerence who at the time of the start of the anime is a gang leader and one of the most wanted criminals of his city, he grew up from being a kid to an adult subjugated by the iron hand of the boss of a criminal organization and had to deal with everything that conveys that but he didn't wasted time and was intelligent enough to be able to grow out of there and make his life his own. He meets Eiji, a person who would become his dearest one and the light at the end of his tunnel giving him a home and a family something that he never had and could tell what an experience was that. \\n\\n\r\nEiji grows along with Ash as they have laughs but also tears, dear time that left them with a desire for more space together to live and enjoy the sensation of being alive here and now. The kindness and protectiveness that they show each other is one of the most enjoyable aspects of the entire show while seeing how their relationship grows is the backbone of the story. \\n\\n\r\nThe area that Ash controls has a chinese gang whose leader is his friend Wong, Shorter and along with him leads the entire space of which his city consists. There is also the mafia, an organization that has a important role in the story and the problems presented throughout the road. \\n\\n\r\nThe Music is polished enough to be enjoyable as the openings(Found & Lost, Freedom) and endings(Prayer X, Red) are relatable and well written songs that can stick around in your head for a while and have lyrics that can be able to relate with our own personal lives, the music is well adapted to the different situations that are presented throughout the story and have a great cast of pieces. \\n\\n\r\nThe Art is different from the rest and has a caracteristic atmosphere that can make it even more enjoyable and unique in it's form and design while using it's art and animation to the fullest by not wasting anything and making everything as good as they can be in their own space. \\n\\n\r\nThis is a spectacular and enjoyable anime that any follower of the medium should give an opportunity to enjoy it throughout the entire experience making it one of the most accomplished anime of it's year. \\n",

The art style was very unique \r\ni highly suggest this anime if you want something different from the usual anime being aired.\r\nnote this anime does have rough topics such as: sexual harassment,drug use, and violence.\r\nallin all this was a 10/10 experience!\\n\r\ndefinitely think this deserves anime of the year!",

I already know some scenes and especially theending but i still watched the anime because i want to know the whole story. I didn't regretted it one bit tho it brings me lots of emotions, i'm sure those who have watched it can relate to me.\\n\\n\r\nRECOMMENDED!

The story is interesting, the characters are rich and the dynamic between each groups is  strong. Not to mention the art and action are very high quality. (Not to mention all the feels!!!)\r\nI don't want to give some big explanation but if you like New York gangs/ mafia etc just watch it (It's only 24 episodes). Trust me when I say the script and animation are solid. At the end of the day that's what any of us look for inan anime really... isn't it?",

            "content": "I'll keep this story as short as possible and minimise spoilers best I can.\r\nStory: 5/10\r\nThe story was what ruined the whole anime for me, it started off brilliantly and I loved the first cour. The action was incredible and it dives straight into the crime and gang life in New York. \r\nThe story follows Ash Lynx as he investigates a drug called banana fish. Drugs, crime and action, I was hooked. Yet, as the story progressed, it strayed further and further away from this very thing which hooked me and in the latter half of the anime I was frankly bored.\r\nThe story then focusses onthe repetitive, 'I have to go save him' trope. Constantly and irritatingly, this repeated several times for about 10 episodes. It was boring and if I'm brutally honest, served as nothing to compliment the fine story built in the first half. As if forgetting everything about THE DRUG, it attempts to be a lot more philosophical and focusses on too many characters and too much drama. Eventually, banana fish loses the very 'oof' it had which hooked everyone. Following the anime, since it aired, I watched as the rating shot up but as the anime closed to an end, I also watched the rating drop, which is evidence of this flaw.\\n\\n\r\nAnother major flaw was the sudden changes in seriousness. The anime tackles very adult themes but at points, it loses all of this maturity with scenes attempting to be funny with changes to the art style becoming almost cartoony for comedic effect. This ruined the whole immersion and interrupted the flow of the story at points. This was particularly evident in the second half of the show and is one of the reasons I did not enjoy it as much.\\n\\n\r\nThen suddenly, in the last 4 episodes, they introduce a new antagonist when we're already at the closing stages of the anime, which made little sense to me.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art was fantastic, it was fluid, smooth and was high quality throughout the whole anime. Particularly, the fight scenes were well done and the CG wasn't even noticeable.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nFantastic OPs, EDs were the highlight for me personally. Whenever I heard the song, the impact it had on me was second to nothing. Single-handedly turned me into a survive said the prophet fan. The OST was also brilliant and made the action more lively and the drama more emotional.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is the highlight of the show. The amount of symbolism, extended metaphors and such used in the character development was phenomenal. Particularly in Ash Lynx. Ash is a character who is a character who suffered through his whole life, abused by those with power and left with nothing. Ash's character development throughout the whole show was fantastic but also tragic at the same time. \\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast was to an extent were excellent. Shorter who was Ash's best friend, Eiji, a Japanese tourist who comes to America along with a journalist, Max, Sing etc. There's a huge cast of character which all play roles in influencing the plot. The character interaction all carried heavy meanings and really built on the themes such as fate (Ash always being brought down and suffering), destiny (will Ash eternally suffer?), hope (will Ash devoid of love ever find love?). These were fantastic and is what redeemed the story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nAlbeit a disappointing story at times, the pure action, badassery and character drama made the story enjoyable for me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nA brilliant anime which I enjoyed to an extent but lets itself down in the second half of the show by going off on a tangent and exploring the characters too much rather than the whole crime, drugs and warfare in the first half. \\n\\n\r\nSPOILERS HERE, IF YOU HAVEN'T WATCHED, STOP READING HERE:\\n\\n\r\nEnding review: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe one redeemable part of the show was the ending. It was beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nAsh is stabbed as he read Eiji's letter carrying all the feelings he wants to tell Ash. This is such a critical point in the tragedy of the story.\\n\\n\r\nRather than seeking medical attention, Ash realises something, that Eiji will come looking for him and for that reason, Eiji will never be safe. So, in his final moments, Ash retreats to the library, a symbolic place of peace, tranquility but also of loneliness. Ash sacrifices himself, accepts the loneliness since it'll mean Eiji will be at peace, safe from him. Ash becomes a martyr in order to protect Eiji, as he knows he is an object of hate and one day that hate will kill whoever he is closest to.\\n\\n\r\nBut it's not just that, he's ridden with guilt. All of his sins and misdeeds have accumulated to an irredeemable point in Ash's eyes. Like the snow leopard who climbed Kilimanjaro, he's reached a point where he is beyond salvation and cannot climb down. So the leopard must die there, alone, on the top of a mountain. \\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, it was a tragic ending but a beautiful one at that.",

So dont make the same mistake as i did, let me tell you beforehand, this anime probably gonna be suitable only for \r\n1. Females (almost all of female will probably like this anime) \r\n2. Male that is into boy-boy Love/BL (I dont know whatis the most suitable word for it)\\n\r\nSo, if you are not one of those 2 category people, i suggest you go and find another anime, this anime probably is going to \"Let You Down, like it did to me.\\n\\n\r\nI got really excited watching the first 2 episodes, because it seems this anime has a really deep craft into the story and characters, mainly the MC.\\n\r\nI basically drop this anime right after episode 3, so i will only review this based on what happen to those 3 episodes, and why i drop it.\\n\r\nFrom what i watch in the first 3 episode, this anime is SUPER GREAT, the story is deep, everything fits perfectly and its totally gonna be one of my best anime for its Mystery and politics aspect like \"91 Days\". But episode 3 tells me the sign this anime is gonna focused on Ash the MC and his lover Eiji, which i Cant bear to watch (I dont Like it, its a personal preference), while everything else seems going really well. \\n\r\nSummary :\\n\r\nStory : Great, i would give 8, and probably its the biggest story score i ever give for an anime that i dropped.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sounds : 8\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : actually without that \"One Element\" i would give the characters score 7, but meh, 3 would be suitable, as it doesnt make any sense how th hell everyone seems so gay in one anime, and it seems everyone want Ash's Ass. And probably this is what the girls would say about harecchi anime, its just this kind of anime suits only for the targeted market.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 4\\n\r\nI did enjoy watch, but it just let me down, forgive me for my stupidity to watch something that i should have skipped.\\n",

The characters and story are extremely good, and it's so easy to just fall in love with the characters! I laugh, smile, and cry because of this anime, and I'm really enjoying it. The art is also nice, bringing in an old style that still looks clean.

            "content": "Disclaimer: This review contains a few spoilers!\r\nI'm going to split this review in categories. \r\n1. Story: \r\nBanana Fish is an anime with a fun name and a decidedly not-fun story. It's serious, dark, and gritty with little hints of humour thrown in. I didn't go into it expecting a good time (though that was mainly because I had been warned) but I didn't expect the bad times to be so bad either. Plot-wise, it's well-written and though there are some things I don't like about it (mostly the decisions characters made), I can't say that I didn't like it regardless.\r\n(Also apparently people think this isyaoi and that's why they didn't watch it?? Well, if you're one of those people, then a big RIP because you're missing out.)\\n\\n\r\n2. Art:\\n\\n\r\nIt's pretty sweet! Loving the colours and the brightness! To be honest, I'm really glad it got remade because the manga's art style was not something I was looking forward to.\\n\\n\r\n3. Sound:\\n\\n\r\n134234/10 Holy. Shit. I love the first ED (Prayer X by King Gnu)! The EDs are always well-timed with the scene and the OPs are not really my jam but still pretty awesome. At least Banana Fish gave me new music to listen to if nothing else.\\n\\n\r\n4. Character:\\n\\n\r\nOkay, so I started off not really giving a shit about Eiji because there wasn't really a lot to go on about him. To be honest, I was still a bit iffy towards the end about him, but I respect him and the choices he made. \\n\\n\r\nAsh, on the other hand, is strong af. I really do like him even though I majorly questioned his choice in the final episode. (Really? You're going to survive everything else and then give up when some rando stabs you? I was really hoping you would go to Japan and live happily since you seemed to have finally gotten it into your head that someone cared. But I still do understand that maybe you thought it was never going to end unless you were dead.) The little sweet moments really brought out other facets of his personality and I do love him for it.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, Shorter Wang deserved so much better than he got. \\n\\n\r\n5. Enjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nWell, I watched this two weeks before my exams and finished it in two days and then spent the next three days rewatching some episodes just because I loved them. So yes, definitely enjoyable and a good rewatch as well.\\n\\n\r\n6. Overall:\\n\\n\r\nA solid show that deserves all the praise it got. Love it!\\n",

            "content": "While this anime has its share of problems I just could not hate it; quite the opposite, I ended up really enjoying it.\r\nThe story is what keeps this anime together but it has some issues. It usually follows a pattern - Ash gets hurt/captured and then he is saved, or Eiji gets hurt/captured and then he is saved, sprinkled with other people getting captured and getting saved. The overarching plot, however, is quite interesting, delving into mafia wars and even nation-wide conspiracy. The anime is based on a manga released in 1985 so you can bet that it's full of pure 80's-style action.\r\nThe other strongaspect of this show are its characters. Both main characters are good in their own way seeing as they are polar opposites. They are also surrounded by fine supporting cast. I also love the character design and fashion. The characters have the 80's feel to them and it's just so good to see colorful, urban clothing in anime.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I disliked in this anime a bit is its ending, but also the representation of gay men. Literally, every single depiction of homosexuality is twisted, save for one scene. The show compensates for that by having two main characters who are not afraid of showing their emotion and have such a great friendship while also being quite badass.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, if you enjoyed the old action movies you will definitely enjoy this anime. It has it all: OP main character that has emotional trauma, evil villain who is just so evil and SO MANY GUNFIGHTS.\\n\\n",

            "content": "It\u2019s easy to get lost in the high that Banana Fish provides. The series has all elements that get adrenalin pumping - action, love (?), drama - from war, gangs, street fights, and all that. Viewers are taken on an unbelievable roller coaster ride with loops and twists, making the stomach squeeze and churn. Inch by inch, Banana Fish brings the audience to the peak of its experience. Unfortunately, for this series, the euphoria of intoxication often follows with a crash. \r\nAs with most eccentric names, comes a double-edged sword. It can be cast off as either \u2018too weird\u2019 or \u2018perhaps intriguing\u2019. Thanks to theclever research and literary ingenuity displayed throughout the series, the otherwise laughable title was fascinatingly and seamlessly embroidered into the literature, especially when referencing J.D. Salinger. Other great namesakes were also artfully included, such as Fitzgerald and Hemingway.  \\n\\n\r\nThe plot was strategically laid out. There was an illusive dealing behind the unknown \u201cBanana Fish,\u201d which involved the infamous Dino Papa, a mafia godfather, and the government/military. Ash Lynx, who led a gang in downtown New York and was an adolescent raised by Dino, stuck his nose into the conspiracy. Later on, the youthful boss was interviewed by Eiji Okumura, a young, ordinary and plain Japanese assistant photographer, reporting on American gangs. During that encounter, Ash and Eiji were kidnapped and plunged deeper into the gang underworld.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhen it came to the art, the drawings and the style weren\u2019t too appealing. The backgrounds and sceneries were good; all in all, above average. Excellent, however, is how one could describe the soundtrack. Especially the first OP, it was a great choice. \\n\\n\\n\r\nFor the characters, the focus will be on our two leading men - Ash Lynx and Eiji Okumura. \\n\\n\r\nIn the beginning, Ash Lynx had a certain shroud of mystery and charm to him. This young man of 17 seemed to have too much brain, brawn, and spunk for his own good. He could have anything he wanted. \\n\r\nAfter repeated spiels of \u201che\u2019s a beast,\u201d \u201che\u2019s wild,\u201d and \u201che can\u2019t be tamed,\u201d it got old. He was someone who could beat IQ tests, hack top-notch security software, AND battle professional soldiers, but didn\u2019t even finish elementary school. It\u2019s understood that he frequents the library and had \u201ctraining\u201d for 2 years, but this was ridiculous. He could literally do anything - a typical Gary Stu, who could not err. The only thing wrong with him was that he was unmanageable, he had a dark past, and his sole weakness was this Japanese prince(ss) who made him feel warm and fuzzy inside. \\n\\n\r\nNow for Eiji Okumura, a meek and timid 19-year-old, who was the typical Achilles heel of the perfect pretty boy. In contrast, he couldn't do anything, but make people either want to destroy him or protect him. His backstory, being a professional athlete, was interesting and had so much potential. But all he actually was was a simpleton of a boy who caused problems for Ash. \\n\\n\r\nEveryone and everything revolved around the perfection that was Ash Lynx, at the end of the day.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOn the onset, the show came out booming and exciting. It had a very unique and real-to-life plot. However, during the latter half, the introductory appeal was lost and the exhilaration dissipated. From the action and thrill, to my dismay, what was left were remnants of a typical shoujo manga. To give context, I had not read anything about the series beforehand. Then I found out that I was ill-informed because Banana Fish was actually a \u201cyoung woman\u201d drama. Gone were the big boys and seriousness of drug dealing or murder, and what took over was a somewhat romance story of young men with emotional baggage/daddy (or whatever) issues who end up running the mafia. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not the series\u2019 fault that I was unaware of its true genre, and personally, I have nothing against the feminine literary classification. The anime was still exciting, but what followed did not seem aligned or did not match the epic build up that was laid out. It's a good thing that the initial heart squeezing had made up for the second half of the anime. \\n\r\nThough, I must admit that the ending was epic and quite unexpected. This did relaunch the stomach-hurling feeling and made it conclude on a badass note.   \\n\\n",

            "content": "(no spoiler review) I had high expectations going into this anime, a mafia type anime, with an 8.3 on MAL.  Unfortunately, to sum this anime up, it is a badly written story with a high production value. I honestly can\u2019t understand why many seem to be praising this as a masterpiece.\r\n\tI will start with the positives. As I said earlier the production of this anime is amazing. The art and backgrounds really capture the New York setting and really add to the feel of the show. Also, I don\u2019t know why this stood out to me, but I absolutely loved the clothing designs. Alongwith this the OST is beautiful, sometimes the pieces they played really added to the feel the show was trying to capture, and even made some scenes. In terms of openings and endings, the first opening was stuck in my head the entire show, and the ending themes really gave the last scene of each episode an amazing feel as it often played over a scene instead of cutting into a nending animation. The fight scenes are the thing that kept me watching. Both the Arthur fight and the climax fight especially. Honestly the best episode of this anime was the last episode, It was so beautifully directed.\\n\r\n\tThat is about the extent to the praise I am going to give this series. Unfortunately, with all the great things going for this anime in its production the story and characters were absolutely garbage. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: How is it possible for a show to be given 24 episodes and not have any character development beyond surface level. I will focus on the villains first because every single villain (and there are a lot of them) are essentially the same. They either want to gain power through banana fish, rape ashes, or both. There are even some that are given literally no character motivation at all, they are just randomly introduced into the plot to be another pawn used to progress the story. Along with this, not a single villain has a backstory. No villain is given the faintest of character arc at all. Every villain exists in the plot just as a tool of the author to torture Ash and suck sympathy from the audience. The entire story is pretty much Ash getting tortured to trick the audience into feeling sympathy as unfortunately for us Ash is also very poorly developed.\\n\r\n\tFor the sake of time I will only focus on Ash, Eiji, and Shorter, the starting trio. Ash\u2019s character is a kid who was tortured as a kid, raped several hundred of times, is good at killing things, and there is nothing else interesting about him. His only motivation is to protect Eiji. Which I guess can be an okay character motivation if Eiji\u2019s presence in this anime was justified at all. In the end the only point of Eiji\u2019s character is to be Ash\u2019s motivation. Eiji is literally the least interesting character in this entire show. His presence in the show is so blatantly forced, why is he even there in the first place? He despite being one of the main characters has literally no backstory. We know that he has a sister that he mentioned once, he had a sports accident and is good at pole vaulting, which both become irrelevant after one episode, and he may or may not miss Japan. That is the extent of his character. He might as well just be Ash\u2019s body pillow. \\n\r\n\tShorter is another character who got no development and is the character who probably would have had the most interesting arc and could have had an amazing backstory. I would have loved to see more about his past and his motivations. Some interactions between him and the rest of the Chinese gang to build on their relationship and add to how important he was to him. Maybe a backstory to how he met Ash, or some more of how he got involved in the gangs in the first place. Maybe add something about him and his sister who we see twice and then forget about. \\n\r\nWhenever a character dies, gets hurt, or anything happens, I feel absolutely nothing. The writing gives me absolutely zero reason to care to any extent.\\n\r\nOn a side note, why are there literally no female characters other than maybe two or three that are relevant for like two seconds and then vanish.\\n\\n\r\nStory: The story is, as I said earlier, pretty much irrelevant. It can be summed up as Eiji is caught or threatened, Ash goes to save him, Ash ends up tortured or raped, they enter a momentary time of safety, Eiji gets caught or threatened again, and this loop continued for the entire show. Nothing interesting happens. There are no plot twists, no mysteries, no suspenseful sequences, everything is just blatantly given to the viewer. This show is so mindless yet acts like it has an original plot. Nothing about this show is original and it adds nothing the genre, everything this show does has been done before and done much better, generations even before the manga. I honestly just wish that such a good production was given to a better written story and characters.",

            "content": "This review covers only the anime, not the manga.\r\nI've heard some label this as shounen-ai and it's not, at all. There was one kiss and it was a transfer of information through the medium of a kiss. It wasn't a romantic kiss. As close as the two main characters became, it could be argued to be a close friendship as much as a romantic relationship. There was never anything that could definitively be construed as romantic rather than friendship. There were a lot of gay characters and a lot of implied rape but that could be part of any dark anime (Rainbow) and doesn't makeit a shounen-ai. Just getting that off my chest.\\n\\n\r\nIt's labeled here on MAL as shoujo and I'd disagree with that as well. Perhaps because it has some actual introspection, that makes it shoujo? I don't know. I wouldn't classify this as shoujo at all, but that's just me.\\n\\n\r\nOn to the meat of the review: this was a gripping anime. I marathoned through it in a couple days and I'm glad I didn't watch it live. It would have been brutal. This anime really never takes a break on the pace. It starts out fast and heavy from episode one and continues at that pace through almost every episode. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I liked about it:\\n\\n\r\n1. I liked the fast pace. It didn't get boring for a moment.\\n\r\n2. Ash's character is one of the best characters I've seen in anime in a long time.\\n\r\n3. It was basically an \"escape from the Mafia\" type story with a government conspiracy thrown in.\\n\r\n4. The relationship between Ash and Eiji was very touching. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I didn't like about it:\\n\\n\r\n1. At some point you'd realize that your loved ones were going to end up as targets.\\n\r\n2. There was a lot of rape. While it was never played out on screen, it go a bit much nonetheless.\\n\r\n3. The ending.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY:  This story had a lot of layers. There was Ash's personal story, intertwined with the mystery-thriller-government conspiracy story revolving around the Banana Fish, intertwined with the sex scandal / government cover-up, intertwined with the Mafia story(ies). In some ways, it was almost too much. I felt that Ash's story was paramount and it was treated as such and that was good. The rest seemed to ebb and flow in relation to how it related directly to Ash at the moment. it made it a little confusing at times as to what was the actual plot. It also was resolved a little too quickly with not quite the level of fallout it deserved. A twenty-second statement from \"The White House\" was not enough to feel like the bad guys had been sufficiently punished. \\n\\n\r\nAs for Ash's personal story, it was fully developed and fully played out. We were warning from very near the beginning and over and over throughout the anime how it was going to end so it wasn't a surprise but it was disappointing, partly because I had hoped it wouldn't end that way, that all the predictions were wrong. It also didn't come about in the way I expected and it felt ... contrived and weak and pointless. It left a really bad taste in my mouth, like I'd just watched 24 episodes for nothing. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:  Ash was, by far, the most complex of all the characters and he was exceptionally complex and it was awesome. I loved his contradictions and conflicted moments. I loved his angst and bitterness. I loved how soft and gentle he became around Eiji. They did a phenomenal job on his characterization. He was consistent and endearing. I didn't feel that Eiji grew that much but I don't think he was supposed to. He did grow some. He grew less afraid and more willing to take chances, but overall, his core nature never changed, but again, he wasn't supposed to. He was the sea wall for Ash to crash into. He needed to stay the same. The supporting characters were very well done and I loved the instances of enemies to friends. Where some people felt the ending was too easily accomplished due to Ash's friends coming to the rescue in almost every instance, I feel that was an integral part of the story. Ash started off alone as an island and ended with some very deep connections that were willing to go to great lengths for him. \\n\\n\r\nART: I really liked the art style for most of this. It was detailed and gorgeous. I wasn't a fan of some of the character art, especially when they were in profile. But it was consistent and that was good. They didn't have everyone look the same or everyone be bishie. I liked that each person looked unique and appropriate to their station and class. The city scenes were outstanding and overall it was a very pretty anime to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe music and sound didn't really impact me one way or the other so I'm not going to delve into it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this was a very good anime with a slightly disappointing ending, but still worth watching. \\n",

            "content": "There were a lot of good anime in 2018, so I'm keeping my hopes high that Banana Fish won't end up as one of the shows the year is remembered by. I'm not versatile when it comes to crime dramas and can't give you a good recommendation, but trust me when I tell you: skip this one.\r\nThere's a lot to unpack here.\r\nBy definition, Banana Fish is a plot heavy crime drama. Yet if you gave me a piece of paper and a bit of time, I'd struggle to write down the events that take place in this show. And that's because it doesn't really havea plot. I swear it starts off with an investigation concerning a mysterious drug, coupled with a young man's revenge story. Fuck me if I know where it goes from there.\\n\\n\r\nBanana Fish is more a bunch of loosely connected mini arcs, each with its own villain, than a coherent whole. The drug story gets lost somewhere in the mess and even the revenge story forgets what it's supposed to do. What you're left with is a rinse-repeat of the same conflicts and themes from start to finish. No one has a clear motivation and there isn't a goal to strive for. That's why it's very hard to stay engaged and care about anything that's happening to the characters.\\n\\n\r\nSaying that a show is poorly paced is something critics like to overuse, but in the case of Banana Fish, it's true to a fault. The show doesn't shy away from switching between five scenes within 60 seconds. You'd think it's bad enough when each of those scenes features different characters, but it's actually worse when a same character appears in two locations within a heartbeat. It doesn't help that none of these people are recognizable or have any connections to the what's going on.\\n\\n\r\nThe only character worth mentioning is the lead: Ash. He is mostly an engaging persona from start to finish. Though they play the cheap bad boy card, he's still likable and easy to cheer for. The pop idol look is certainly silly, but does the trick. I have two major gripes with him. The first one being that his over competence seems a bit unbelievable when compared to the gritty nature of the show. The second one, oh God\u2026\\n\\n\r\nBanana Fish throws rape around like it's nothing. The show's counter balance for Ash's perfection is his dark past, i.e. all the abuse he goes through. Please note the present tense in that last statement. There wasn't a single villain in this show whose agenda wasn't to sexually assault him. It's like their main motive was to abuse Ash; other criminal activities would always come second. Ash was assaulted or played into being assaulted to gain some \"advantage\" multiple times through out the show. The consequences of these actions to a person are HORRIFYING (yes, caps lock). Yet the show treats Ash being raped the same as if he fell down and got a bruise. In no way is this properly addressed and it is mostly played for shock value. I don't know what more to say other than it is utterly disgusting.\\n\\n\r\nWell, if that didn\u2019t put you off watching the show, there's also Eji.\\n\\n\r\nUsually, stories start from the point of view of an uninvolved character. Eji, like us the audience, isn't familiar with the American underground and is thus the perfect vessel for us to get to know that world. However, Eji appears only half way through episode one and his overall screen time is negligible. Instead, the show takes the rather risky approach of throwing us straight into Ashe's shoes. Ash takes up most of the screen time and we learn a lot about him through his actions and inner monologues.\\n\\n\r\nSince the show doesn't use Eji to introduce us to the world, it's baffling why he exists. The romantic undertones that exist between them in the first few episodes are there only so you'd thirstily stick with the show hoping for something more. Nothing Eji does progresses the plot or helps develop any of the characters. He doesn't make any useful observations or gives new perspectives on the situation. He is one of those blank slate characters that can easily be replaced by a piece furniture. You really wouldn't loose much in the process.\\n\\n\r\nThe character design is rather bland. Ash is very recognisable, but everyone else is just an already-seen visualization of a common stereotype. The backgrounds aren't any better. Some ghetto locations were vivid, but most of the scenery were copy-pasted concrete buildings. The animation quality is actually pretty good - the action scenes in particular. There was a fight on a train midway through the show that held my attention with ease. Shame the stakes were never high enough to really get your blood going. As for the soundtrack, I don't recall much of it other than the horrid engrish OPs and EDs.\\n\\n\r\nSo there you have it. They say 2018 had a show for everybody. If you're really itching for a good old mobster tale, I hope there's something out there better that this. Also, don't get smitten by the yaoi click bait. In light of all the abuse that goes on in this show, romance is the last thing you'll be thinking about. More like vomiting this shit out and getting yourself a detox smoothie.",

            "content": "Probably what's the award-winning Mangaka Akimi Yoshida best know for. \u201cBanana Fish\u201d, at the time it was being aired sure made a loud boom in the Anime fandom, a scream that the original fans of the source material are sure to be the one who heard first. For a Manga from the years 1985-1994 to only receive an Anime adaptation after 24 years from its conclusion, which compliments perfectly the number of episodes it has (I don't know if that was an act of coincidence or made or purpose) sure was a surprise to all of us, and it was a welcomed one.\r\nThe show isoften met by a lot of homophobic criticism as it heavily deals with gay references and implies heavily on that, those are probably the people that miss the point from the story as the case with the characters that can really be substituted by anybody else and still carry on the plot in the same manner.\\n\r\nI feel like, for that alone, the majority of bad reviews come from those type of people that couldn't handle a simple plot device and ended up trashing the whole franchise without even (Most likely) properly finishing it.\\n\r\nOne other side note to make, don't let the fact that this show is labeled as \u201cShoujo\u201d fool you, it doesn't hold back on diving into torture, child pornography and abusive content at all. So beware.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory (6/10):\\n\r\nOne guy was blessed with beauty and strength. Something deeply desired by the average human being is only met with a faith worse than that of a stray dog. We're talking hoodlum of the streets and lowlife gangs, government conspiracies and threatening life and the doorstep of a brutal crime family in the unforgiving streets of New York, such is the life of Ash.\\n\r\nThat is until he met this innocent Japanese dude that clearly was playing with fire without even realizing it.\\n\r\nThe plot in general moves at a very considerable pace, neutrally fast natured, action-packed and also doesn't fall short on contrasting the amount of action with an overdose of homosexual encounters. As it follows the story of an abused young kid, it captured perfectly the horror of what was the hell poor Ashlan had to deal with from an extremely young age to his now 17/18 years old self.\\n\r\nI personally am not into the homosexuality side of the show, but it doesn't really matter in the greatest side of things, because there was still a plot to carry on down the road, and as the show tried to clear out, those are real-world problems and we just have to face them at one point or another.\\n\r\nThe biggest problem with this show is the unbalanced choice of turnarounds. The plot relies heavily on a repetitive cat and mouse game that does really get into your nerve at a certain point. Like seriously, every single arc was just the same thing, only having different characters involved. And what was even lamer, it only revolved around this unwanted stranger (Eiji) that every part targeted him for being the supposed \u201cweakness\u201d of Ashlan. It really gets lame after a while.\\n\r\nAside from the action and thrill filling the screen, there was a great part of the story occupied only with sadness and sorrow, grief at the corner of every backstory there is, which by the way was all concerning Ash.\\n\r\nI get that the story revolves mainly about him, but that's pouring too much focus the guy that a lot of other great characters are easily neglected and untouched upon.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt (7.5/10):\\n\r\nThis is only noticeable after a little while. It is no doubt that the series was greatly produced from a visual side. Not only was it set in an American setting, but it felt like another Hollywood adaptation with the way the camera angles were and the action scenes in particular. You could tell how American the show felt just by analyzing the cinematography that went on all camera shots and direction in general.\\n\r\nThe weakest point here was the inconsistency of art style. It's not the fault of the source material being that old and so it had its mark of age visually speaking. The original artwork has its charm as well, but the majority of the time, there was a continuous shift between the original art style and a more modern take at times, especially considering character design and faces. It was most apparent from side shots where a character looks dated seen from the side until he or she turns him or her head directly at the camera when it's suddenly this very +2010 type of art style.\\n\r\nThat really did nothing to hold back the series per se, however, it was worth noting how uncanny of them that was. Going either by the original art style or a new modernized one would have had the same effect, but mixing to very different and distinguishable was kind of weird.\\n\r\nNot to close an eye on animation, for that one was very well taken care of. Studio MAPPA invested some clearly-felt effort in this adaptation with their cleanly animated fight scenes, especially the ones involving epic martial art and bullet exchange.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound (8.5/10):\\n\r\nI'm just going to jump straight into complimenting Hirata Hiroaki, the same legend behind the voice over of Sanji from One Piece. It was impossible for me to unhear that as soon as I realized it.\\n\r\nAsh's performance by Uchida Yuuma, a figure not that well known in the medium, at least compared to somebody like Max's voice actor (Hirata Hiroaki), but apparently, talent isn't tied to how big your name is, and thus, I won't blame you if you thought that performance was the result of some world-class voice actor because I know I thought the same. Mr. Yuuma really carried on that role perfectly seeing how much of the emotional shifts they series goes through, from screaming of anger to crying in pain, it felt natural either way.\\n\r\nI can't say I got an enormous enjoyment from the collection of soundtracks used here, sure they highlighted some of the intense gunfights, but it was too intense most of the time that it was hard to even notice.\\n\r\nThe opening and ending theme songs were of another league. I wasn't the one appreciating them from the first encounter, but they sure grow on you that you're too attached to let go when they are changed, and the same happens with the new ones just shortly after.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (6/10):\\n\r\nI was greatly disappointed when it came for characters.\\n\r\nAsh was clearly given most of the spotlights if not all of them, as hard and catastrophic everything was for him, you could at least beg for a wider selection of interesting characters. Yes, there were plenty of exciting faces, but the show wasted a huge opportunity to invest in them.\\n\r\nThe only characters I think of that had the greatest character development in the show were Ash and Sing. And still, Sing lacked any interesting backstory or anything of that sort to better explain his motives, he was just there as sort of a replacement for another character that died.\\n\r\nThere were some really brilliant faces, like Blanca, Max, Shorter, Yut-Lung and I could only keep going, too bad it went all to waste.\\n\r\nThe show really only seem to focus on a character if it was doomed into dying the next episode, it almost became like an obvious pattern to their death sentences.\\n\r\nOne other very weak aspect was the constant buffing of Ash's profile and the extraordinary amount of plot armor. Ash was introduced as this cold killed that didn't care much for the higher power and was just doing what he always did in order to survive. Until they kept up throwing plot devices like how incredibly of a high IQ he had. And I don't really care if he was that much smart or just another brainless hoodlum, but it was too painfully obvious to come up with that just when some secret intelligencies started investigating in his plotting. Not only that but on realistic notes, the things he survived through would put him into the status of a superhuman, nobody can carry on a fist fight, holding on to a weightful adult body that's about to fall and more, and that's just after not only taking a beating but also after being stabbed at the shoulder repeatedly. If anything, he should have bled out until he went unconscious, but I guess you just got to pull some out of the world plot devices to steer down the action I guess.\\n\r\nLeaving plot armor abuse aside. Some character really had a messed up sense of logic. Take Yut-Lung for example, going as far as cursing one's blood and at the same breath expresses how blood has nothing to do with anything.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10):\\n\r\nDespite a lot of disqualifications, this was a hell of a trip.\\n\r\nSitting back on your couch and enjoying a show isn't that hard, especially with an action-packed entry such as this one, but ranting over the little things is one part of the enjoyment, at least for me.\\n\r\nThere was a minimal annoyance for me when it came to homosexual references, but that was easily cooped up with, as I said, it really isn't about the character as they are easily substitutable.\\n\r\nConcerning the relationship between Ash and Eiji, I don't really think there was anything implying that they were meant as a couple. I know I wouldn't want that, but it's not about what I want, they really were just best friends that contrasted each other, call it best buddies or bromance. Whatever suits ya.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7.2/10):\\n\r\nI should really raise the point of homophobic-ism, this show doesn't hold back on being somewhat of an extreme gay-ism, if you're not in good terms with that, you're better off not watching this show, as I've seen a lot of people get severely disappointed by that on different parts of the series, and end up dropping the show. But if you don't mind any of that, this would really make for an amazing ride, one that also doesn't care about your tiny fragile heart, and thus shows you the hell that Ash went through that you'd better be thankful you didn't. God be with all the people suffering from the same thing in real life. Have fun.",

            "content": "Banana Fish was a show I was going to overlook, mainly due to its name and plot summary. It sounded like it would be an awful show, and the only reason I gave it a chance was someone mentioning it had fighting scenes. I was blown away by the first few episodes available at the time, and faithfully watched each new episode on the day it came out each week after that. I'd think of the plot of the previous episode while waiting for the next throughout the week, and it took me a few days to get over the ending, one of which Icould think of nothing else, and got no sleep that night. I still think of it all the time, and I always look for bits of fan content or references (the one in Skull-face Bookseller Honda-san, though small, made me smile).\\n\\n\r\nBreaking it down...\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\r\nThe story never takes a break throughout the show. It's extremely fast paced, and although you still get most of what's happening me re-watching the show made me appreciate the way the plot flowed a lot better. There was plenty of suspense, and the situation was constantly changing, as well as the setting. Many have complained about the plot getting repetitive with how often characters are kidnapped and then saved, but that didn't bother me much since so much else was going on and it made sense each time it happened. However, serious topics are discussed clearly and are a major part of the plot, so I wouldn't recommend this to younger viewers. Banana Fish did a good job showing how wrong those topics were, though. Most of the time I'd leave the episode feeling disturbed and uncomfortable, and the fact it affected me so much is part of why I like the show. Some scenes were just cringey, though, and Banana Fish could have toned it done a bit, since Ash's entire life was one long miserable one with the absolute worse happening every time. Luckily, I had been wanting to watch (or read) something with a protagonist like that, and Ash fought as much as he could given everything against him. There were also some rare moments of humor or rest.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThe gangster/city theme of the show was great to look at, and the clothes and character designs were impressive. I was in awe of the art at the start of the show, but at some point the quality dropped and I began to notice the corners being cut every now and then. The last episode tried its best to bring up the quality level again, though, and unless you're looking for it near the later middle you should be okay. I liked how different Eiji looked when acting as a waiter of sorts in one episode, and how Ash seemed in another when given a suit and green earring, compared to their rough appearance while on the run and in the action. The contrast showed just how much they were going through, and the other gang leaders have a similar street appearance. Backgrounds were great, keeping in mind being in a crowded city most of the show, and even having some luxury locations (a party area and a fancy flat).\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nNo complaints here. The OPs and EDs were all great, and I didn't skip a single one. The openings were full of hype, and endings brought out a sorrowful feeling. All of it fit the show well, as they were written for Banana Fish. The voice actors, especially Ash's, did a great job showing all the emotions needed. Papa Dino's voice actor unfortunately died while the show was running - but his character still has all his lines (except maybe in the last episode, where he is pretty much mute, but for understandable reasons plot wise). Background music fit well with what happened.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nAsh is my favourite character of all time. He was so real, and extremely impressive - even though sometimes he seemed to be too much of a Gary Stew (200 IQ, perfect fighting and gun abilities, leadership skills). There were plenty of faults, though, and he was extremely aware of them. The other characters such as Yut Lung, Eiji, Blanca, Sing and Lao all experienced character development and changed as the series went on. The villains were the weakest part of the characters and show, with many just being plain evil with no redeeming qualities, such as Foxx and Papa Dino (who at least has some interesting interactions with other antagonists, but is unforgivable).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nMy introductory paragraph speaks about how much I was invested in this show, and I enjoyed almost every moment watching it. Episode 20 wasn't as great for me, as I notably didn't enjoy it as much, but when re-watching it I found it to be quite good. It's not a show everyone can handle, or enjoy, but personally I found it to have me invested more than pretty much any other I've seen. I'm eager for any more content, whether an OVA or dub.\\n\\n\r\nReview Overall: 8.8/10\\n\r\nI added up the scores and divided by 50 to get the final score's percentage.\\n\r\nThis might be different from what I have on my anime list, as it's more of an assessed mark than the score I give on my list after finishing the show based on how I felt about it at that point.\\n\\n\r\nFinal note: Reading the epilogue, Garden of Light, found at the end of the manga, might help provide some closure.",

            "content": "Seriously, no idea how all viewers should be 17+ and this is getting positive feedback. Lots of \"cheaters\", I guess :D\r\nAn anime, which could have been a proper street gang story, totally ruined by a forced love story making creators believe they need nothing else. To the feminists' joy, the useless, whiny, delusional character with zero development, this time is a male.\r\nPlot is unoriginal and built around torturing the lead character repetitively because he is all this anime has, then kidnapping the useless character bound to be his supposed love interest. Gets boring after the first attempt and unbearable after the second.  The suspensecomes from your wondering how many times people can use the same \"hooks\" and deliver the same lines without thinking any character, especially a smart one, would not bite the same bait 4-5 times. What is also amusing is that every time the supposed tough guy \"accepts his fate\" and \"takes responsibility\", he eventually agrees to be saved. Because if he doesn't, there will be no more episodes without the need to dig deeper and develop an actual plot.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason Ash Lynx (lead character) loves Eiji (main character) so much is also as badly thought of as the anime. No spoiler really. It is \"because he wants nothing in exchange\". Besides you changing entirely as a person, that is...Even if we accept Ash feels this way, we all know he had at least one true friend, who was not using him long before ever meeting this guy. Name is Shorter. So, what did he want? Surely, no one let us know.\\n\\n\r\nThe lead character is constantly contradicting his own life philosophy on whether he is way beyond any physical harm, free to use his own body as a weapon or he is just a poor suffering soul. Guess it is hard to create a full-blooded character who will suit the popular opinion and be able to get on the fanservice bandwagon.\\n\\n\r\nTrue, there are few worthy moments such as exposing (or explaining?) US politics in the Middle East and...well, think that was it.\\n\\n\r\nArt is pathetic, leaving characters looking deformed and literally faceless at times. Animation is getting so much worse as episodes progress, you start to wonder if the \"star-boy\" is even worth all the fuss. Ridiculous, taking into account that according to its creators, main character Ash's looks displayed later in the anime are elaborately inspired by the late River Phoenix. More likely, you can say his entire character is \"inspired\" by Makishima Shougo. Someone we also know pretty well from Psycho-Pass. \\n\\n\r\nIf you liked Psycho-Pass, you will also love the B1 \"test space\", shown in the second part of the show. Very original indeed. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the closest to this anime is Togainu no Chi, which at least did not hide under the false pretences of being something more than a character market for fan girls with an emphasis on \"special\" drugs, sexual crimes and extreme violence. Wonder why it was not liked and Banana Fish is, but my guess is it's because of how the anime market is lately.\\n\\n\r\nI have only finished all episodes to see how bad this will be. I started with a 7 and now reached 3. That bad. I really hope this is the end and there are no further seasons. At least not with these compromised characters.",

Its themes and story is so tied to that post-Vietnam era that they cannot be transferred to the 21st century with a coat of varnishand smartphones. If it had made the choice to completely re-edit the story to make it related to the American paranoias and fears of today, MAPPA might have had a masterwork. As it is, a lot of it just ends up a mess.\\n\\n\r\nAdaptations are so afraid of changing the story they\u2019re working with, probably because of negative fan reaction to such things. But Banana Fish is a story with so much potential, one begging for a revision or two to make it shine. MAPPA just couldn\u2019t make themselves go there. The modernization idea itself is not a bad one; it\u2019s simply that they put no thought into the decision whatsoever beyond \u201cmaybe we can make some of the research scenes go faster.\u201d Because of this, Banana Fish ends up tangled up in itself, spiraling towards its tragic conclusion, stuck in the past, even as the story takes place ostensibly in some version of the present.\\n\r\nSo, yes, I had a lot of issues with Banana Fish. For everything the modernization and adaptation made better, it made an equal number of things worse. The things it made better were tantalizing because they hinted at a Banana Fish that could have been perfect. \\n\\n\r\nI loved Banana Fish a lot too. Ash and Eiji\u2019s relationship is wonderfully realized, making scenes much more painful than they had any right to be, thanks to the stunning design and the amazing voice acting talents of the two leads. I was invested in the story until the end. It felt like something the people working on it felt strongly about- I don\u2019t really have a way to prove that, but it\u2019s just to say that the life never went out of the production. It\u2019s a show with a lot of promise- ones it never quite made good on. I recommend giving it a watch, if only for the sake of fascination. It does so many things better than a lot of shows with BL elements and it also does so many things worse.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like numbers\\n\r\nStory: 6/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\r\nModernization: 3/10\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nAnimation: 8/10\\n\r\nSoundtrack: 10/10\\n\r\nVoice Acting: 10/10\\n",

I'm quite surprised, actually. They developed the story quite well, gave the information to everyone but the characters.\r\nArt: That's hot to draw some nice non japanese faces. Eiji is drawn clearly as in Japan about animes, a japanese boy, the one from USA are lot different, not only by hair+eyes. I see the effort put on it.\r\nEijijust brings troubles on scene but helps Ash to keep going on.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Shonen Ai with action, pretty cool, even I, who watched it by curiosity kept watching because it did take my attention.",

            "content": "Disclaimer: these are my personal opinions, there is no attempt to make an objective critique. This product stirred some thoghts that I thought might be worth sharing.\r\nI cannot honestly rate it positively, because it didn't give me pleasant feelings, and pleasant feelings are my main reason to keep watching anime.\r\nBut it gave me food for thought, which makes it worth of some consideration. In the end, plus and minuses counterbalance so perfectly that the vote annihilates itself rather than being mediocre.\r\nThere are several things that got on my nerves here:\r\n- The usual gross cultual misunderstandings. I have learned to overlook them over the years, butsomehow they're still nagging me. Manga and anime authors tend to have much the same fantastical approach towards western society as most westerners have towards japanese society. It's mostly in the details (stuff like \"the dairy something\" on a newspaper frontpage, Ash Lynx wearing shoes and sweaters no man under 50 would ever wear on any occasion...small things really), but it makes everything feel a little \"off\" especially since the series has a lot of focus on the cultural clash between the protagonists.\\n\\n\r\n-The homophobic feel that pervades the whole thing. I mean, every openly gay charachter is a sadistic pedo rapist.  They're all american of course, because in Japan there are no guns, no pedos and no gay people. Unless it's a deep romantic male friendship that could never go past a purely platonic bond. (But hey, I know, that's how japan sounds like these days: mysoginistic, racist, homophobic -and many other countries are experiencing similar conditions apparently. Gotta love the good sides and forgive the bad sides, I suppose)\\n\\n\r\n- Japan feels much like the land of Horai described by Lafcadio Hearn. Much as I can understand the metaphore of cultural clash as a loss of innocence, rite of passage, rape of mental virginity, and much as I'm not particuarly fond of American culture, I don't believe the protagonist had to cross an ocean to find himself some violence and mafia to ravel into. They do have corruption and crime and all the bad things too. But hey, Banana Fish comes straight from the eighties, the bubble economy and al that, despite being set in the present. And probably one might want to consider that, especially when coming to the \"warriors of the night\" feel that pervades many parts of the narration. \\n\\n\r\nNow, I don't consider watching anime an intellectual activity. It's something I do as a form of light entertaining at breakfast when I'm still not completely awake. So why do I bother? Because this anime seems to want to be taken seriously, it wants to be so damn deep man. It keeps awkwardly fumbling and rummaging with emotional strings so much that - despite some grotesque dramatic excesses (really Ash Lynx's life is something more. You can't keep from laughing if you make a clear summary of all the terrible misfortunes the kid went through while keeping moderately sane, beautiful and so incredibly clever and oh God, he's charisma itself) - it does hit a few chords. The occasional Tsukasa Hojo-style tear is there waiting if you let your guard down. Consider this a warning if you're not into heart-breaking stuff.\\n\\n\r\nI said there is some awkwardness, but I believe that's what makes it worth watching nonetheless. Because the narration seems to be much more free from charachter and plot stereotypes than in most contemporary works. Its \"vintage\" feel is mostly there, in this use of a still developing emotional language, not yet completely and clearly encoded.\\n\\n\r\nOn a note of purely personal taste, I found the soundtrack wannabe gangsta style pretty annoying. But I don't like \"gangsta\" aesthetics and wannabeism makes my ass itch.",

            "content": "Since its beginning in the summer, Banana Fish has been one the most followed anime of 2018. In that regard, it has captured the acclaim of popular opinion within the anime community for its emotional and thrilling story about personal bondage and greed regarding a mysterious drug. But now that it has come to a close, does it merit the praise it has received ? the short is no. The longer answer is below \r\nSynopsis* \r\nBanana Fish is takes place in the streets of New York where gangs and money control the flow of power in the country. In particular, the story focuses on AshLynx, a blonde pretty boy, that commands the drug and gang business for the kingpin of the city, Dino Golzine. Things take a turn when Ash receives a mysterious drug from a dying man;unbeknownst to Ash, the drug is a heavily guarded treasure of Golzine.  \\n\r\nMeanwhile, Ash becomes acquainted with two Japanese journalists Shunichi and Eiji who are covering a story on Ash himself. Conflict arises when Golzine, sensing that Ash is willing to betray him and discover the truth behind the drug, calls for the capture of both the drug and Ash by any means necessary. \\n\\n\r\nStory*\\n\\n\r\nMuch of the story involves the cat and mouse chase between Golzine and Ash which transpires to involve the higher powers in society putting stakes on the recovery of the drug, with each having their motives for involvement. At the same time, Ash deals with his troubled past and self hatred which led him to this chaotic present. Banana Fish alternates between the two in order to drive the motivations can be seen as a parallel problem for Ash;however, it never manages to develope each adequately by relying on cliches of crime drama. The story itself is not initially bad; however, as it progresses, it became a repetitive event of Mexican stand offs and hostages where it became apparent that there was a shortage of ideas and lack direction in developing the plot. One could predict exactly how each of these stand offs would end-ruining any chance of actual excitement for the audience. Speaking of which, the initial excitement of the Banana Fish was supposed be abut who would end up with the coveted drug. Instead, the show took a turn and concentrated more on making Ash some sort of prized genius by every antagonist available. While it is important to give importance to the protagonist, it is proper to lose focus and settle the entire problem being a character when much was already built on the initial premise. Finally, once the show did lose focus, the ending arch disappointingly decided to play it safe by cutting down the main conflict to a comfortable and easy resolution, thus it seemed as though there was a waste time for the viewer who could have drawled out an easier solution 12 episodes earlier. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters*\\n\\n\r\nAs the show initially started, it became apparent that there would be nothing novel about the characters, and as it progressed, attempts were made to carve out unique identities but still failed. Ash is something of recently developed caricature in anime where some light skin guy with either blonde or white hair has an attitude problem and hates everything; the only twist with Ash is that he is some sort of genius as well as being being indestructible to shanks, bullets, and knives.Golzine is a typical villain that does things for his own pleasure at the expense of the others, Eiji is a mary sue that seems to see the good in Ash and loves him unconditionally despite having no credible reason to do so, and the rest are functional as can be.That is not to say they are horrible but remain uninspiring.Additionally, another weakness problem is placed in how each character developed with the plot. For Example, it can be understood that there is some romantic type of relationship between Eiji and Ash but it is done at a surface level by sprinkling some moments here and there without being convincing the audience of their chemistry. The same is done with all other characters,; the show needed to slow down and focus more how each interact with one another in genuine moments rather than being placed a brisk paces where one still has not bought in\\n\\n\r\nSound* \\n\r\nSoundtrack is average with the only notable features being the second op and ed. Both songs are well made and captured some essence that Banana Fish was aiming for such Grief and Trauma. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation* \\n\r\nNothing too remarkable although it is quite colorful and instantly recognizable\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment* \\n\r\nBanana fish is not boring and can be enjoyed if one turns off their brain ,but it ultimately catches up with the viewer when the series goes into safe and obvious conclusions.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall*\\n\r\nBanana Fish is a series that demonstrated great potential and could have been great if it had done things properly.The first few episodes did a good job of cutting the work out for itself ,but it never managed to develop in a satisfying manner.It is bad series that has to many surface levels executions and not enough substantive deliveries.\\n",
