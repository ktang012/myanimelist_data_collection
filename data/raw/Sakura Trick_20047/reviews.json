            "content": "This right here is a cult classic, a chef d'oeuvrea buried under erroneous preconceptions and unfounded criticism. This gem is obscured because it does not shine; it is buried because its tone is that of abyssal black. Sakura Trick pries into to the darkest corners of our subconscious, the most visceral of our cognition, the most carnal of our urges, and the most primal of our instincts. Its sublimity will ever be debated yet always remain objectively irrefutable; the fundamental insight it provides into human and perhaps animalistic nature may shape the basis of sexual psychoanalysis for millennia to come. \r\nSuperficially, Sakura Trick appears tobe an anime which caters to the most lowly and deprived among men; conceited critics dismiss it as such often without a second thought. As self-important as these self-proclaimed critics are, they fail to realize that Sakura Trick is indeed a trick, and they are the ones being tricked. Sakura petals, or cherry blossoms, are commonly associated with a sense of beauty and innocence in Japanese culture. As discussed by Ango Sakaguchi in Sakura no Mori no Mankai no Shita, sakura petals are often a means to enhance and stylize the atmosphere of a scene, be it melancholic, resplendent or sensual. Used famously in 5 Centimeters per Second, the sakura petals constructs an immense yet artificial atmosphere which proved successful in fooling the average fool incapable of critical analysis. What most critics fail to realize, however, is that Sakura Trick is playing them beyond this level. The entire visible layer of Sakura Trick is a euphemistic veil obfuscating the dark and uncanny human psyche which it explores; any tangible material is a metaphor for its meticulous meta-analysis of the metaphysical mentality\u2019s pubertal metamorphosis. \\n\\n\r\nAs brilliantly put by Charles Baudelaire, \u201cLa sexualit\u00e9 est le lyrisme des masses.\u201d In Ulysses, James Joyce subverts gender conceptions by deconstructing sexual stereotypes; in Lolita, Vladimir Nobakov delves into the abnormal perversion of hebephilia; in Doctor Glas, Hjalmar Soderberg studies sexual catharsis through murder; in Aquarion EVOL, Shoji Kawamori studies the manifestation of repressed sexuality as love. Time and again, great thinkers have demonstrated the immense potential of sexual psychoanalysis in narrative form. \\n\\n\r\nSakura Trick fulfills this potential. \\n\\n\r\nThe exterior plotline of Sakura Trick is straight forward - two damsels unknowingly in love with each other: Sonoda Yuu and Takayama Haruka, start high school in the same class with four other apparent lesbians. This premise alone poses innumerable questions of pertinence - most of which are problematized further and explored as the series progresses. Why are two girls romantically interested in each other? Why are there four more girls of questionable sexual orientation in their class? Were they perhaps influenced by Haruka\u2019s and Yuu\u2019s display of intimacy, implying a nurture over nature determination of sexuality? Do their behaviors suggest abnormalities in their amygdala activity, or is such behavior governed by the wider cerebral hemispheres?  Hailed as the father of psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud once said, \u201cThe sexual life of adult women is a dark continent for psychology.\u201d The stringency and inadaptability of the traditional approach practiced by psychologists is to blame for this. Sakura Trick is unshackled from such rigidities - by investigating high school girls in late puberty, a time and setting in which sexuality is at its most volatile, and doing so through homosexuality rather than the vapid norm, it sheds light on the enigma which has eluded psychologists for centuries.  \\n\\n\r\nPerhaps most imperative and counter-intuitive of all, Sakura Trick investigates male sexuality through the scope of lesbianism. Je veux te baiser, baisez-moi! What is the sexual appeal in a couple which can only engage in abortive reproduction? When exposed to intercourse in explicit yuri, it is plausible that lust for the opposite gender can override the notion of evolutionary feasibility. Despite the lack of explicit intercourse in Sakura Trick, male viewers nonetheless experience a craving for the girls\u2019 well-being instead of jealousy and contempt for one of them as would be rational. This paradox challenges not only the Darwinian theories of evolution, but also Freud\u2019s theories of sexuality. He wrote, \u201cA man's heterosexuality will not put up with any homosexuality, and vice versa.\u201d Sakura Trick proves the exact contrary: heterosexual men more than put up with the homosexuality in the series. According to psychologist Henry Havelock Ellis, \u201cReproduction\u2026 is highly complex and not yet clearly understood. It is not necessarily connected with sex, nor is sex necessarily connected with reproduction.\u201d Havelockian philosophy noticeably makes its mark in Sakura Trick; by taking hold of this anomaly in human behaviour and untangling its implications, it explores the darkest depths of our consciousness which borders between flesh and mind. \\n\\n\r\nIn his essay The Sexual Abberations, Freud discusses human disposition to perversions, including hebephilia, as an original and universal disposition of the human sexual instinct which is not limited to the psychologically ill. Sakura Trick takes this theory beyond mere discourse and puts it into practice. The characters in Sakura Trick are impeccably crafted, not only in their characterization and likability but primarily in their support of the series\u2019 psychological study. Rather than each being equipped with sexually inviting traits, some characters are simply \u201ccute\u201d, for lack of a less vulgar word. A certain je ne sais quoi of the girls are successful in generating not just physical, but more importantly emotional cravings from the audience. \\n\\n\r\nThe brilliant technique of Sakura Trick\u2019s probing into the atavistic lust is most aptly demonstrated through the analysis of the two main characters: Haruka and Yuu. On the one hand, Haruka is characterized by her lascivious and manipulative personality, pneumatic figure, seductive voice, and red hair indicative of her prurience. In contrast, Yuu has an innocent demeanor, underemphasized curves, a sweet voice characterized by childlike tenderness, and bright amber hair adorned with flowers \u2013 all of which are suggestive of a girl in the early stages of puberty. By contrasting these dichotomous traits, Sakura Trick follows in the wake of Vladimir Nobakov and his analysis of the abominable erotic attraction to the so called \u201cnymphets\u201d. A range of recent research by neurologists suggest paedophilia\u2019s origin as a deep-rooted predisposition that does not change, rather than the previous theory of causation by psychological influences. Perhaps influenced by this paradigm shift, Sakura Trick attempts what has never been done before \u2013 bringing out, in men, pseudo-paedophilic reactions to girls older than the previously stipulated plateau age of thirteen. This is achieved through the stark contrast between Haruka\u2019s maturity and Yuu\u2019s infantility which tampers with the viewers\u2019 preset dispositions. The additional fact that it succeeds in bringing out such abnormal responses not only in the susceptible older population, but chiefly among the young, truly underscores the groundbreaking impact of Sakura Trick.\\n\\n\r\nLa peinture parle d'elle-m\u00eame, il n'y a rien \u00e0 dire; to describe the artistic qualia of Sakura Trick would be to describe colour to the blind, wisdom to the young, or life to the unliving. The artistic eminence of this series is utterly unparalleled. The visuals are primarily based on a minimalistic design reminiscent of Frank Stella\u2019s later paintings, yet some of the most visceral moments of the series display a paradoxical resemblance to abstract expressionism. This visual style is augmented by subtly and tactfully altering its background or occasionally foreground objects into abstract patterns or drawings depending on the situation and atmosphere. Certain patterns such as polka dots reoccur frequently throughout the series, showing inspirations from early pop-art but crafting a style most avant la lettre. In a masterful display of expertise in art-direction, these aesthetic shifts are extremely frequent yet uncontrived and never interfere with the viewers\u2019 immersion. This enigmatic and radical style vividly complements the metaphysical nature of the series, reinforcing its character as an original pastiche of the post-modernist movement. It is an embodiment and perfection of the ideals that SHAFT had in mind for but failed to accomplish in their shows such as the Monogatari Series and Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei. \\n\\n\r\nAnother of Sakura Trick\u2019s aesthetic perks is its use of letterboxing: further cinematic flare is added to the already immersive series through the occasional framing of the video in bars. However, in an bold act of defiance and subversion, Sakura Trick makes use of white bars rather than the traditional black. In addition exuding an ephemerally fey charm, the white letterboxing holds several implications that one may only speculate on. Does it symbolize the series\u2019 immense depth as it creates a dual-layered letterboxing on monitors which do not match its aspect ratio? Does its brightness reflect the series\u2019 enlightening exploration of the previously unknown? Does it indicate the series\u2019 nature as an antithesis to conventional psychology? Incidentally, Sakura Trick shows an abnormal and seemingly perverse focus on the characters thighs. In any other context, this would be plain pandering to the lowest common denominator. Nevertheless, when contextualized in sexual analysis one will realize the use of thighs as a study of fetishistic reactions to sexually inert objects. Sakura trick is sublime not only in the depth of its investigation, but also in its breadth.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment may be a pivotal factor of anime-viewing for the ordinary viewer. For experienced critics such as I, however, examining a show of such depth and complexity brings only misery and agony (which true intellectuals welcome, mind you). Attempts at analyzing Sakura Trick\u2019s implications and unraveling its messages necessitate great concentration and effort, which is further exacerbated when so much of my blood flows elsewhere than my brain when viewing this show. As studied in neuromagnetic stimulations, encumbering the brain to a great extent can be a cause for physical pain. We critics are martyrs \u2013 through our self-sacrifice we free plebeians of their ignorance and ablute them of their sins. \\n\\n\r\nThere have been numerous undisputable masterpieces among anime, such as the Ishihaya Tatsuya\u2019s strikingly realistic classic Clannad or the tactique extraordinaire Code Geass by Taniguchi Goro. Sakura Trick will not join their ranks; its surface is too generic, its themes too provocative, and its messages too obscure. It will remain underground \u2013 treasured by the most avant-garde among intellectuals for its edifying if horrifying insight into the fundaments of sexuality. Philistines and self-proclaimed critics alike will shun Sakura Trick, but you can\u2019t fault them for that. It takes boundless wisdom to appreciate its subtleties, and courage to side with the unpopular opinion. Sed domi maneas paresque nobis novem continuas fututiones. The time of Sigmund Freud\u2019s sovereignty over psychoanalysis has passed; Sakura Trick is the herald of a new era that is to come.\\n",

            "content": "When it comes to Anime, implied sexual attraction between two female characters is an often repeated trend. The main issue here is the word \"implied.\" Very rarely are we treated to a blatant representation of lesbian couples, and the most we get are vague undertones that are just sort of there in the background. This stirs the audience's imagination, while still playing it safe at the same time. It's a real shame, because this squanders golden opportunities for presenting unique relationships that could potentially result in more memorable characters. Sure, Yuri series have been done before, but just try finding more than a couple ofexamples from the past few years. If you're not looking through Hentai, it isn't easy. Sakura Trick is a rare gem that isn't afraid to go all out, as if in direct opposition to the current trends. With its cast of colorful characters, along with an intimate romance that has the ability to melt the hearts of countless viewers, Sakura Trick offers solid proof that there is too much untapped potential present in the Yuri genre for it to keep being neglected any further.\\n\\n\r\nThere isn't any overarching story present in Sakura Trick, as is usually the case with Slice of Life series taking place at high school. Instead, each episode is divided up into two segments that depict a different day from Haruka and Yuu's first year of school as they deal with the comical situations that their budding relationship gets them into, as well as the complications that inevitably arise along the way. The first segment lasts for around half an episode, and then the second takes up the remaining run-time while covering a different scenario. Despite this, the pacing for each part isn't as fast as you would expect. A lot is packed into twenty minutes, but there's plenty of slow and easy-going moments that will make you feel very comfortable with the way things are proceeding. While some may view the lack of a concrete story as a negative point, it's clear that Sakura Trick's priorities lie with the characters and their romantic development.\\n\\n\r\nAs the main couple of the show, Haruka and Yuu get the most time in the spotlight. Haruka is very possessive of Yuu, and gets jealous whenever others get too close. She's very assertive, but never to the point where she does anything that Yuu wouldn't be okay with. She also has a very overactive imagination, leading to some of the best comedic moments of the show. Her perverted fantasies make her a far more realistic character, as they mirror the thoughts that any young girl might have towards the person that they like. Yuu on the other hand, has a more stubborn personality, and isn't as honest with herself as Haruka is. This results in some great progression later on, as Yuu begins to express herself to Haruka in more direct ways. The contrast between Haruka and Yuu makes their unique form of love all the more fascinating to watch, and at no point does it feel unnatural that they are together.\\n\\n\r\nYuu's older sister Mitsuki provides needless conflict to Haruka and Yuu's relationship, but still manages to be likable in her own right. She forms a crush on Haruka, and struggles to come to terms with her newly found affection. The issue is that this creates a bit of unnecessary drama later on, which just feels out of place in a show that was doing so well without it.\\n\\n\r\nHaruka and Yuu are joined by a circle of close friends that liven up their high school days. Noda Kotone is a rich, playful girl who lives her life to the fullest in order to leave no regrets behind. She is staying at the same house as the quiet and reserved Shizuku, who doesn't have much of a presence. Eventually a love forms between the two of them as well. The few scenes that they share together are some of the cutest of the whole show, so it's really a shame that more episodes weren't devoted to expanding upon their relationship. The last two characters are Kaede and Yuzu, who are mostly present to provide their own wacky sense of humor. They play their roles near-perfectly, but they're definitely low on the show's priority list. For what little screen time they share alone together, they are given a fair amount of depth. Without these supporting characters, Sakura Trick would lose a large piece of what makes it so enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nSakura Trick is renowned for its adorable romance, and this is one area where it really shines. If you want to see some heartfelt moments between two lovers, this series has you more than covered. It doesn't take much to throw two characters on screen and have them kiss, and indeed Sakura Trick does do this, but there's a reason why it works so well. It's because the emotions feel genuine. Haruka and Yuu share a relationship greater than that of two random girls making out solely to appeal to the male demographic. This isn't some forced, fake romance--it's real.\\n\\n\r\nThere are numerous examples that establish  the authenticity of these feelings. We can tell that Haruka cares more about Yuu's happiness than her own. She'll go out of her way to form a study group when Yuu is having trouble in class, and she'll make an appeal to the student council to have a cheering squad just so Yuu can fulfill her dream of being a cheerleader. It's the same with Yuu, who despite getting into quarrels with Haruka, always has her in mind. She knows Haruka really values their kisses, so even though she has a more passive personality, she tries her best to take the initiative. It's because of this mutual affection that a mere kiss can become something truly special. The fact that Sakura Trick didn't stop at pointless fan service and went that extra mile by presenting a believable romance reveals that the creators had more than just money on their minds. Other romance series can take a few pointers from the pure, consensual love present in Sakura Trick.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're after a few laughs, Sakura Trick will most likely satisfy in that department. This show is based off of the original 4-koma manga, where a joke needs to be effectively executed in a mere four panels, so extra care is put into each and every punchline. It never feels like a joke was thrown in just for the heck of it, and some even reveal quite a bit about the characters involved. Unfortunately, there are a few cliches and repetitive jokes, such as misunderstandings between characters, mixed in with the more well-written material. Overall, I wouldn't say the comedy is anything entirely new or groundbreaking, but the characters are what really make it work.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of effort was put into Sakura Trick's animation, and it shows in all the right ways. Vivid colors are used to emphasize the characters' unique personalities, while the backgrounds are less detailed but focus more on creating a calming atmosphere that make watching very easy on the eyes. If you notice any similarities to another major animation studio, then you aren't imagining things. Studio DEEN uses many of Shaft's techniques, to the point where you'd think it was a Shaft work before looking it up. It closely mimics many aspects of the popular series Hidamari Sketch (the primary reason being that the same director was involved);  it uses the same quick scene transitions and sound effects,  as well as symbols used on screen to represent the position or introduction of a character. Because of this, Sakura Trick fails to establish its own identity in the visuals department. They aren't exactly terrible though, and anyone unfamiliar with Shaft's works will still be able to appreciate them.\\n\\n\r\nOn the subject of visuals, I should also note that the fan service can really get obnoxious at times. The camera just loves to focus on bouncing breasts and the thighs of characters at the most unfitting times. This is one of the major reasons why I couldn't bring myself to fully enjoy the show. Sure, it's nowhere near as bad other current shows, but those looking for a completely pure experience will sadly be disappointed by this fact.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound itself is unremarkable, with the exception of the soft piano and violin tracks that play during romantic scenes. The opening and ending themes will be catchy enough to stay stuck in your head for a while, and I'd say that they are what stand out the most. The voice actors also put on a above-average performance, especially Iguchi Yuka as Yuu and Tomatsu Haruka as Haruka.\\n\\n\r\nSakura Trick is one of my favorite romance anime to come out in recent years. It's much more than mindless fan service devoid of any sort of substance, and actually portrays a love that feels both endearing and natural. While each character has their own flaws, it only makes them feel more human and less like an uninspired cardboard cutout. Sakura Trick is a step in the right direction for romance shows, and for Yuri in general. Hopefully it will inspire others to create better stories that depict this often neglected form of love. I certainly hope that time comes soon.",

            "content": "At the start of the season, Sakura Trick came in strong. While there has been tons of yuri undertones in anime, characters with physically intimate relationships are still pretty rare, so seeing two high school girls locking fingers and making out was what one would consider \"the bees knees\", and animation segues in vain of Hidamari Sketch, and even the same DIRECTOR? Hell yeah. Sign me up. This could never get tiring, right?\r\nTurns out, it takes a mere half a season for it to go from a novelty to a daily routine. After a dozen and half make out sessions, they stop meaning anything andbegin to seem like a time filler. Beyond LESBIANS~, you are stuck with a cast of characters who are, quite frankly, dull as dishwater. Too much time is squandered away on Haruka, Yuu, and Mitsuki, and the rest of the supporting cast don't get enough individual screen time for themselves or to even get a chance to develop their own side-stories that aren't resolved instantaneously.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the OP and ED are high energy, the actual OST is rather serene, giving scenes that require a higher tempo BG no punch, and at times, comes off as dissonant with the activities and dialogs being exchanged. Even if backed by a proper OST, it still wouldn't help because gags are too seldom and too few warrant a chuckle.\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals are fine, but mostly because it's similar to Hidamari Sketch, except heavily indentured. Part of Hidamark Sketch's charm was the odd animation segues, cutaways, and minimalism. The SHAFTisms separated it from its other SoL peers. Unfortunately, Studio Deen isn't SHAFT. They're a poor company who make low budget garbage like Hetalia, Higurashi, and Pupa, so we're left with the most basic fragments of Hidamari-esque cutaways. Instead of attempting to reinvent Hidamari's SHAFTisms, it's more than content to copycat them very, very poorly. Aside from those little touches, the coloring, while a nice change from many shows that use bright hues, can contribute to the malaise I was feeling as I powered through each episode week after week. The animation is what you would expect from a low-tier studio: most average, but spotty. In terms of quality, it's pretty high end for Studio Deen, so I guess congrats on not making something that looks like complete pigshit for once?\\n\\n\r\nBy the end of the season, watching Sakura Trick went from how I kicked off waking up at God-knows-what-hour on Friday mornings to go to college into a chore that I would hold off for several days, finished only out of obligation for coming so far. I really did want the novelty to never die. I really did want to like the characters and find them interesting, but as episode 12 was coming to a close, I had my epiphany: This show is boring as shit.",

            "content": "Sakura Trick is a refreshingly different Slice of life show, it throws away the concept of static timelines often seen in SOL shows, there is continuity between each episode and changes in each character and their relationships, minor or major, can be felt together with the passage of time. \r\nThe show presents to us a cast of multifaceted characters and the relationships they share, not solely romantic bonds, but also the ties between friends and between sisters. \r\nWhat I loved most in the show was how it built on its characters. Sakura Trick avoids the use of heavy dialogue and inner monologue as a meansof developing it's characters. Instead, the characters change subtly with the happenings of each episode, leaving space for interpretation on the part of the viewer as well as giving it a natural feel.  \\n\\n\r\nFor example, as Mitsuki says, Yuu is often not honest with her true feelings, this is something we see through her actions rather than words. I'll give a minor spoiler to illustrate this point. \\n\\n\r\nThis trait can been seen from the very start when Yuu makes a phone call to Haruka. She 'checks on' Haruka and quickly hangs up as if just doing a routine check, but the fact that she was awake past midnight and that she called Haruka with nothing substantial to say gives away the excitement she's hiding, she's starting her life as a High School Student after all. \\n\\n\r\nThe way the show dealt with dramatic scenes was another thing I liked. There is no reliance on contrived situations nor do they blow mundane problems out of proportion in Sakura Trick. Tense situations are resolved quickly and the characters avoid escalating the issue. Presenting drama this way feels much more natural.  \\n\\n\r\nSome might see this as weak storytelling but I would argue in the opposite direction. Because of the show's episodic nature, there is a tendency to dismiss that each scene has significance beyond their respective episodes, but as I previously pointed out, the characters change subtly with each event, the feelings they experience at each point weighs on them and affects the way that they behave. \\n\\n\r\nIt's easy to overgeneralize and dismiss the series as purely fan service. Fanservice is present, in terms of selective shots, but this does not distort the characters. Some dumb down the kissing to being a service for the viewers, completely overlooking the relationship between Yuu and Haruka and the emotions which drive each kiss.\\n\\n\r\nIf you do plan to pick up this series, try to look at it from your own perspective. Look at the characters as real people rather than try to stereotype them.",

There is a story with romance, BUT, the way it is executed is poorly most of the times. So again dont like yuri?! SKIP THIS!\r\nNow, I said it was a yuri fanservice, so what can you expect, if you do enjoy yuri like myself??\r\nEvery episode is divided by 2 mini episodes, most of the times, each has a different kind of mini arc story going on.\r\nAnd for the most part, in each ofthese mini episodes, you can expect some hot yuri scene, there is no mature content here. but the anime doesnt really need it to show its yuri colours, and if you enjoy those, you gonna love when those happen, be flustered even. Honestly some may think of it, like a hentai anime or something to satisfy your \"needs\", whatever yours are.\\n\r\nBut with time, I came to realize it was actually heartwarming for the most part.\\n\r\nThe animation is simply, yet enjoyable, and great on the yuri scenes and the sound fits the atmosphere, parts of the OP and ED were very catchy, thought most of the times I only heard the intros for each, then skipped the rest...\\n\r\nArt 9 & Sound 8.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo where did this yuri anime, which seems to have potential by what I wrote failed??\\n\\n\r\nLets start with the characters, there is not much complexity to each, not really cliche, but still, while the MCs became more decent with time, everything just feels like, \"oh, it is another all school girls Slice of Life\". Most of the stuff are pretty silly, so the characters had potential to more, but failed to reach it, they stand to support the \"story\" and the yuri romantic scenes, and for the most part, while the cast is decent for a yuri anime... that is it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd where comes the big downer for the anime. The story!\\n\r\nI m sure the anime follows faithfully the nature of the origin source, the manga. But by doing so, due to its nature of storytelling, there is almost no sense off progression overall! I dont hate episodic anime, but for a romantic story, it feels kinda lackluster, each episode has its story happening, that for most part seem not to be connected, with some exceptions like the last 2 episodes.\\n\r\nI kinda enjoyed the first episode, and was expecting to get that feeling of progression, that makes you want to see the next episode, to continue the story!\\n\r\nGenerally what happened to me was, \"gotta progress on Sakura Trick, meh, there is no plot, besides Yuri that I dont feel in the mood for now, what is compelling me to go at it?? Then seeing it, cute yuri!! YESS!... It is over, lets see what is next on my list.\" That kinda of thing, not memorable at all, a good story makes you want to keep reading it, keeps you wishing to see what will the plot next infold into.\\n\r\nAnd so... it kills alot of the potential the anime could have, has a proper story, it really does. Okay, most yuri suck, but I have seen some with better stories than this one! And when well explored, the romantic yuri scenes, with proper drama, character and story development, those can became very addicting, a compelling and enjoyable experience, that will make all its yuri fanbase, experiencing lots and lots of doki doki moments!\\n\r\nSo, while the story had its moments, it was for the most part mediocre, which if viewed mostly for people that dont enjoy yuri, as trash.\\n\r\nStory 5!\\n\\n\\n\r\nWith that left behind, I m a yuri lover after all, so while the story sucked, and probably one of the worst story developments I have seen in an anime yet in these recent years (lucky me, there are worst...), the yuri yuri doki doki scenes, the lighthearted aspect and Yuu and Haruka relationship that while nonsensical at parts, was enjoyable and cute to watch.... all in all, it shined for me at certain moments, and I kinda got surprise that there is lots of yuri every since the beggining, while at most yuri content, you gotta get over alot of progression to start seeing the good stuff. This one, says \"Like yuri yuri?? Here take it! Make sure you get your hunger for cute yuri filled, we will not mercilessly make you beat around the bush for longer, enjoy!\". Despite the faults, I did enjoyed the anime.\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it will came to be a very polarised experience, it firstly depends of the basis of you enjoying yuri romance, or not.\\n\r\nAnd then even if you do enjoy, being honest, it could had been so much more.\\n\r\nIf only the main aspect, what supports the overall progression you will have with Sakura Trick, the story, didnt fell flat on its face, and the overall cast together had more complexity... I could only imagine, but it would be a really great interesting yuri for sure! \\n\r\nI know it, probably is just the format of the manga, but has I have not yet read it, I dont know if it works there.\\n\r\nIf it did, that doesnt means it would surely work with the anime adaptation. So maybe they could had changed, and added more stuff to the adaptation?! \\n\r\nAn adaptation doesnt need to be 100% original to its story, IF what is changed/added is for an overall better experience with the adaptation versus the original work...\\n\\n\r\nI m glad yuri seems to be taking more prominience nowadays, but I hope others learn from Sakura's mistakes, and its virtues, and someday make story that fully fleshs out and explores the genre's potential.",

The art and music are fantastic, and the character development is superb. It's very cute, and also leaves youwanting more! Overall, this series is quite unique, and is different.

            "content": "Something that I find fairly interesting about Sakura Trick is the title itself. What comes to mind when \"Sakura Trick\" is uttered? Sakura, which is a flower with a lovely shade of bright pink, and trick, a fake-out of sorts, which may contain mischievous undertones. What was the inspiration for the name of this title? Every time I see this title, I can't help but feel like I'm about to stumble upon a beautiful disaster, or a \"sakura-colored trick,\" if you will. Of course, the term \"trick\" can also be defined in other ways, but for the purpose of stating an argument, the previously stateddefinition will be used.\\n\\n\r\nThe \"trick\" in this case, would be the underlying messages that accompany Sakura Trick. On the surface, this title is about two girls who attend a school that is slated to be closed (though, this holds no importance), and decide one day, by complete chance, to kiss each other, in order to strengthen their relationship. Once this happens, their relationship becomes more than that of ordinary friends, as they cannot seem to get through an episode without kissing seven times.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the kissing between two teenage girls itself is the main factor of the show, it is also by far the worst problem this show has. Not in the kissing itself, but the way it is presented. Contrary to popular media, love is not a drug, and the act of kissing shouldn't be compared to that of taking cocaine. What Sakura Trick does so well is displaying a strange, relieving sense of tranquility while the kiss is going on. Feelings of anticipation, slight awkwardness, and a genuine amount of affection can be felt during (roughly) all of the kissing scenes, and not always necessarily between the two main characters. Despite this, it's both predictable and out of nowhere. When an opportunity arises where the two main characters can be alone, the audience knows they will take it, and the audience know they will kiss, regardless of whether or not the mood suits it. It starts to become the only reason this show has any airtime. This is where the \"trick\" comes into play.\\n\\n\r\nThe two characters that kiss most often are Haruka and Yuu, and are assigned as the show's main protagonists. When these two characters are with each other, they act as though they're a couple, except they aren't. Though, when surrounded by friends, they show discretion, almost as if their kissing is a secret from everyone. Oh wait, it is. Something to note about the characters in this series is that they try to be funny. They try to make the audience laugh and feel good about any situation. Though this might cause the audience to not take anything seriously, there's a larger problem: the characters are dull. Try as they may, most of the jokes aren't that funny. When Sakura Trick decides to spend more time \"developing\" the relationship between Haruka and Yuu, they brush off other characters to do so, lest the secondary characters have a romantic relationship of their own (all characters are female, by the way). This leaves any screentime not dedicated to girls kissing much to be desired.\\n\\n\r\nThe \"sakura\" within this trick comes through with the animation style. Upon watching this, I would've bet my house that the animation studio responsible for Sakura Trick was Shaft. I was pleasantly surprised when I found out Studio Deen was responsible, as they seemed to dabble in Shaft's mannerisms within Sakura Trick. The art style and design of the entire show will at least keep an audience attentive. There are multiple examples of quick, transitional frames that showcase a character's personality well. Yuu's signature flower clip is shown prevalently throughout, and I could tell that the animators had fun stylizing the characters' features to their whim. It helps an already dull cast of characters seem full of life and charm.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the animation is fun and the kissing scenes are nothing but passionate, Sakura Trick is conveniently named as a trick. The entire concept of the show and its emphasis on two girls kissing feels shallow altogether, and a lot like bait. Any redeeming factors this show has is muddled down by tryhard dialogue and bland characters. Only the final two episodes of Sakura Trick try to deal with the relationship of Haruka and Yuu in a mature manner, but by then, the damage has already been done. It's a show one can turn their brain off to, through and through. But it's not like we have enough series like that already, right?",

            "content": "Sakura Trick is a yuri anime from this year, started in January finished in March. The manga it's based on was written and drawn by Tachi and the anime version was handled by Studio Deen. Studio Deen has done several yuri series/ series with heavy yuri content before. Including Maria sama ga Miteru, Yamibo and Simoun. So far, none of these series have been bad, although some have come closer than others. That being said, Studio Deen has done some pretty egregious anime in other genres. Such as Kore wa Zombie desu ka. Still, they do have a pretty good record so I'm cautiously optimisticabout this one. \\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nOur story begins with a group of students entering their first year of High School. Haruka and Yuu, two girls who attended Middle School together, end up in the same class, but on opposite ends of the room. Haruka sees Yuu link arms with other girls and runs to an empty classroom, feeling dejected. Yuu follows to apologise, having known in advance that her actions would make Haruka jealous. The two have a conversation during which Haruka reveals that she thought they were special to each other. Yuu argues that they are and she will prove it by doing something with Haruka that she wouldn't do with anyone else. This leads to the two of them kissing rather passionately. \\n\\n\r\nThis has, quite possibly, the fastest hook up I've ever seen in a romance series, with the two leads getting together right away. Most of the series involves them and their friends getting into shenanigans with the two of them trying to hide their relationship while sneaking kisses. In fact, I don't think there's a single episode without Haruka and Yuu kissing at some point. Sakura Trick is something of a rarity since the tension doesn't come from how the two leads will get together. Rather, it comes from two sources. The first being whether or not they'll get found out. The second being that Mitsuki, Yuu's older sister, also develops romantic feelings for Haruka. That's going to make family gatherings awkward. Honestly, I prefer this type of narrative to the more traditional one. If you're watching a romance, you know that the leads are almost certainly going to hook up eventually and it can just get annoying watching or reading a bunch of material that teases about it. At least this format dispenses with all that crap and just lets you enjoy the cute elements of their relationship while also providing some story threads for tension that basic pattern recognition doesn't instantly give you the conclusions for. So, the tension does work pretty effectively, even if most of the series is more dedicated to cutesy or comedic slice of life moments. \\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of comedic elements in this series and, as a whole, they're really well done. Just about every joke hits the mark and there aren't any that don't at the very least elicit a smile. The relationship between Haruka and Yuu is positively adorable. The series also manages to have a narrative that flows pretty smoothly in spite of the episodes being largely unconnected. There's a very clear chronology for the series. \\n\\n\r\nThere's really only one problem with the narrative. Unfortunately, it's a pretty major one. There's a secondary romantic couple with two of Haruka and Yuu's friends, Kotone and Shizuku. The problem is that Kotone and Shizuku are cousins. In all fairness, they don't get a huge amount of screen time, but it's still really disturbing every time they get a scene. The worst part is that there doesn't seem to be any awareness that this is a bad idea. It's treated as \u201ccute\u201d within the series. Because when I think of cousins snogging, I think \u201coh, cute.\u201d Oh, wait, I don't because it's not cute. It's just messed up. There's not even a good reason for them to be cousins. They could've been childhood friends and it would've made no difference to their story arc.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this are really good, overall. Haruka and Yuu are adorable and have great interactions. The major side characters like Mitsuki, Kaede and Yuzu are a lot of fun. Even Kotone and Shizuku have some good character moments if you can ignore their disturbing relationship. Now, the side characters tend to be pretty much non-entities, the teacher, Rina, Sumi and several others. They don't exactly feel like one-dimensional stereotypes, but they come pretty close. Although, to be fair, they do have a purpose within the story even if it is a very small one and it would be highly unreasonable to expect every minor character in a twelve episode series to get developed. Furthermore, they do serve their functions just fine.\\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\\n\r\nThe art in this is kind of lazy. The character designs themselves are nice and there are some good sequences, particularly the way they animate the ending. However, the backgrounds are pretty bare and people who show up in the background are frequently drawn without any features. They're just kind of blank. The artists also dispense with any kind of detail for the backgrounds on several occasions, replacing them with colourful heart patterns or some such thing. \\n\\n\r\nThe worst factor in the artwork is the fan-service. There are a few scenes where they use it for the sake of a joke, but more often they just have random fan-service scenes or oddly angled shots for the sake of fan-service. Did they really think they needed to play up to the heterosexual male gaze in a series where girls frequently kiss each other? All the fan-service ultimately does is detract from the cutesy elements. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThere are some really good actresses in this. Our leads are played by Iguchi Yuka, who was also Mako in Girls und Panzer, and Tomatsu Haruka, who played Anjou in AnoHana. They both do a really superb job and really convey the chemistry between Yuu and Haruka perfectly. They also got Fujita Saki, Ymir in Shingeki no Kyojin, and Fuchigami Mai, who was Miho in Girls und Panzer as well as Alice in Doki Doki Precure. All the actresses do really well in their roles. The music is really good too, helping accentuate the mood. \\n\\n\r\nHo-Yay: \\n\\n\r\nThe ho-yay factor is going to be a 10/10. I know, the fact that this is a yuri romance probably clued you in. Haruka and Yuu have a really good relationship and it does develop and strengthen throughout the series.  We also get the kissing cousins, who I really don't want to discuss in any detail. Mitsuki's feelings for Haruka are also really well handled and lead to some good moments, both dramatic and comedic. Rina is also heavily implied to have feelings for Mitsuki, one of the only traits she has. Yuzu and Kaede have a really close relationship that could have pretty easily moved into romantic territory, but never does. \\n\\n\r\nWhy no, I don't find anything odd about there being no straight characters in the main cast. And no, I'm not just saying that because straight characters are rare in my own writing. Hurriedly changing the topic, Sakura Trick has a lot of affectionate scenes. As previously stated, pretty much every episode has a kiss at some point and there's also some hand holding, cuddling up and the like, but the series never moves into explicit sexual territory. It prefers to keep things cutesy. Which is  a good thing given that the characters are pretty young and cutesy material is far better suited for the atmosphere as a whole. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nSakura Trick is a pretty good romance. Yuu and Haruka make for an adorable couple, the comedy is effective and the sources of tension are really good. Still, the series is hurt by the secondary relationship between Kotone and Shizuku and the use of pandering fan-service. If you can forgive those problems, you will probably enjoy the series for its cute and funny moments as well as the romance between the two leads.  My final rating is going to be a 7/10. Next week I'll take a look at Kill La Kill.",

            "content": "~A personal journey into the world of forbidden love, buried under a pink veil~\r\nOn the surface, Sakura Trick doesn't seem like the kind of anime to have many unique or redeeming elements. Its vibrant, predominately pink colour scheme and slice of life presentation will impress nobody from a glance. With the further belittlement of the Shoujo and Yuri tag associations, its no wonder that few come to appreciate Sakura's delicacy.\r\nA lot of Sakura's strength is in its simplicity. It is an uplifting representation of Shoujo, that ironically plays no tricks. Its straightforward almost to a protesting, influential extent, and it exposes the genre from amultitude of viewpoints...\\n\r\nFrom the predictable Yuri-like intimacies, to the more heartfelt emotional friction between the characters - it may take a few episodes, but one can quite easily begin to appreciate the show's vivid, heart-warming, and surprisingly innocent nature.\\n\\n\r\nSakura goes on to quite vividly document through everyday life, the highs, lows, struggles and battles no matter how small-scale, from the perspectives of many; as the prominent relationship between the main characters evolves. Due to the (from a critical perspective) self-limiting simplicity of the show, it has to pay close attention to its detail - and this is exactly what it does to counter its endlessly rehashed premise.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is inescapably charming, cute, upbeat, very personal, very intimate, dramatic at times, but primarily... delicate (despite first impressions). Throughout, Sakura continuously flicks between casual slice of life-like presentation, with its fair share of comedy;  and romantic, more cinematic, serious, and emotionally-driven presentation. This variety adds to its realism and therefore immersion. It allows for the development of a distance between these stances, establishing more contrast, and giving the viewer a \"behind the scenes\" type feeling, an appreciation of the show's personal and intimate nature. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of presentation, the Art and Sound are flawless, and so despite the often associated one-dimensional nature of Shoujo shows, Sakura appears to know exactly what it is, and plays this mixture of controversy and deeper meaning into the content itself. I definitely was able to engage with the show, as i particularly liked the representation of the intimate awkwardness, and the forbidden, two-vs-society perspective.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said though, i won't deny that Sakura has minimal \"must keep watching\" factors, as the individual character development, alongside the story, is very simplistic. It only has power if you permit it to, and so a show where you are in control of your own engagement, is likely to bore those looking for a more dramatic romance. It's genuinely difficult to rate the show, as a lot can be read into it. If you're an interested SoL and/or Shoujo and/or Yuri fan, it's subjective, but give credit where its due, and you'll realize the beauty of this deceivingly cloudy-looking gem.",

            "content": "A love confession. A passionate kiss. That's something you usually get as a payoff of a romance story, right? Some kind of lovey-dovey epilogue might follow, but the story is about the road to love and all those intense, romantic scenes are its proper conclusion. That's standard.\r\nSakura Trick is not that, as clearly shown even by its opening. This series is pretty much all about teenage girls kissing and being awkwardly-romantic with each other. And even more kissing. Lots and lots of kissing. In various, not always justifiable situations. It features three couples, with one being pretty openly at it from the very beginning andthe other two blooming along the way, but without any deeper drama or doubt on what they are about. It's all very straightforward and fairly silly, just in the way you would expect this kind of purely-comedic show to be. \\n\\n\r\nHow about the execution? Well, the show is fairly pretty, often taking some minor shortcuts with animation and environment, but always solid with its main characters and when portraying more significant scenes (ex. kissing is always very detailed and colourful - the team behind Sakura Trick knew its priorities). The voices and op/end music are also fine. My main gripe is actually with the writing, which is serviceable, but never really great. Even this kind of fanservice'y show can be genuinely funny and witty, or even include some bits of believable romance. Here the jokes only ever got me smiling a bit, story didn't really go anywhere and the characters never even came close to Yuru Yuri levels of being memorable. While genuinely fun to watch, the whole experience felt pretty hollow. \\n\\n\r\nSo, is it worth your time? Your enjoyment will depend mostly on whether you like yuri and the kind of mild fanservice this show offers - while it has the main couple making out pretty much every episode, it actually rarely goes overboard with nudity or creepy shots you would know from other ecchi anime. I honestly thought that the kissing scenes will grow old pretty fast... But for me, they didn't. There's just this kind of cuteness and gentle sexiness in this brand of yuri fiction that always gets me, no matter how much of it I happen to see. Still, there's really very little substance to this show, even in comparison to many other episodic comedy anime I've seen. \\n\\n\r\nIf you're like me, starved for all kinds of yuri content, you should definitely watch it. If not... You won't lose that much by skipping it.",

You have 2 girls (best friends?) entering high school and this high school is closing down in 3 years. In order to remember their high school experience, these 2 girls shared a kiss (a long kiss). That's all i've seen so far and I'm not watching anymore episodes.\r\nArt 5/10\r\nThe Animation is decent but not great...\r\nSound 3/10\r\nI haven't heardany soundtrack in this show that gave me goosebumps or even a thought of \"man, this soundtrack is great\".

The group of friends we see are all fun and interesting in there own way and they all have someone that they fit really well with. But this right here could be seen as a problem. There are duo's that should be couples together but some aren't while the others are. I guess what i'm trying to say is that some are never in an officialrelationship while 1 or 2 feel like they should.\\n\r\nHarukaxYuu\\n\r\nKaedexYuzu\\n\r\nKotonexShizuku\\n\r\nYuukaXRina\\n\\n\r\nThese are the group of people that best go together but duo's such as Kaede and Yuzu are kind of teased as being a couple while Yuuka and Rina seem to be perfect for each other ( I think Rina has a Crush on Yuuka) But we are subject to Yuuka having a crush on someone else and it just doesn't really fit. This is the really own big issue i can think that is worth mentioning.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy is good especially how Haruka can be so oblivious to certain things.\\n\\n\r\nThe art itself is really good and better than i would have expected from such a story. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all i feel this is i nice little gem that i never hear talked about.

This review is all 12 episodes, so it'll contain heavy spoilers. Overall I believe this anime is in my top two favorite animes. Trailing behind the greatest masterpiece of all time; School Days. If you have not seen my review on School days, I advise you to look at that first to have a good idea on how my reviews are. \r\nMoving on, Sakura Trick was first off, very enjoyable. My penis was hard 90% of thetime. I loved pressing my D against my dakimakura every time there was a yuri moment. The story was unbelievably amazing. It's obviously Slice of Life mixed with hot yuri scenes. What else could you ask for in the story? The plot twist at the end was just outrageous. Even though the best girl (in all of our opinions) didn't win, the story was fantastic. 10/10 No problem.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was immaculate. You could see the saliva exchanges in all of the kissing moments. That made my D REALLY hard. Did you even watch the OP? The art and animation on that shit was fucking amazing. When all of the girls were dancing naked, that just did it for me. I was instantly hooked. So it was an easy 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound was just as great. When the girls were kissing, you could hear the moans as if they were kissing another girl in real life. That's how I like my porn. I REALLY like hearing the girls do the nasty shit together. So I have no problem giving the sound a 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters and their development was just as beautiful. Watching Mitsuki develop her feelings really set the standard for me. After witnessing that greatness, I compare every anime to her. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI ENJOYED THE FUCK OUT OF THIS ANIME. I FUCKING PROMISE YOU'LL ENJOY IT AS MUCH AS I DID. I WANTED TO HAVE FAT LESBIAN YURI SHIT IN MY FACE SO THAT'S WHAT I GOT. I got to jack off a grand total of 15 times to this anime. What other anime or even hentai, could you say that about? You can't. Because the yuri scenes are absurdly great. My dick is waiting for something to top this shit. 10/10 overall. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading.",

It's quite well known that giving a praise and high rating to this kind of anime is such a taboo, and here I am, doubting myself, asking myself the question : am I being biased? After some time of thinking, then I concluded, no! Judging an anime by its genre is as bad as judging a book by its cover. As a medium of art, anime allows for creators to express themselves the way theywant, and Sakura Trick, happens to be one unique and sweet experience that I enjoy so much.\\n\\n\r\nNow, what makes Sakura Trick stands as a great show? This really baffled me because I\u2019m unable to have a clear answer. Usually for anime that I enjoyed, I could readily pin point the good things about them, but this one is vague because at glance, all that can be seen from this anime is sweet and comedy. \\n\\n\r\nAfter some thought given, I think the one that appeal me the most is the light-hearted atmosphere that Sakura Trick has created. It\u2019s funny, hilarious, and non \u2013 logical, but at the same time, I felt it indirectly trying to show us how wonderful the world would be if we can just love each other. This realization makes me appreciate this anime even more, because I think it\u2019s a kind of critics for our society, who love the others only if certain conditions is met, whether it is social status, religion, interest, or anything else. Why can\u2019t we just love each other? Giving hugs and kisses? Should love only be limited to a couple? Why don\u2019t we make this world more wonderful with warm hugs? \\n\\n\r\nI would say, Sakura Trick had become the first yuri anime that I truly enjoyed.\\n",

If you like watching cute girls make out, this is a perfect anime for you.\r\nBeyond the surface level yuri, a lot of the scenes between the characters can actually be touching and sweet. The way the two main characters explore how they really feel about each other is very similar to what someone would experience in highschool, samesex relationship or not. The characters themselves are nothing too special, but their interactions seem mostly genuine and realistic.\\n\\n\r\nThe general story just follows the two main characters and their relationship together, but there are many scenes that seem forced for pointless. Visually, the show is nothing special. They attempt boob physics but it comes off more as comical than sensual. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this show is very enjoyable if you like drama and cute girls kissing.

I truly believe this anime was just all about how many kiss scenes and how many yuri love doki doki moments they could have. And honestly, I'm fine with that, it's just that you can never take an anime seriously like that and that's also fine. But just don't expect some amazing story and plot development, just expect a LOT, of beautiful yuri moments. And trust me, you will be so happy ;)",

It was the first Shoujo-Ai anime i have watched since i finished Aoi Hana, and no, it's not implied Shoujo-Ai nor did it just give Shoujo-Ai undertones, it was 100% Shoujo-Ai all the way.\r\nArt - 8: I gave it an 8 because i rarely care about the art, as long as it was watchable i'm fine with it. Visual were okay, though the anime'sfluidity wasn't that good, not mediocre, mind you.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7: To be honest, the OP was cute, it had me singing along some times, but the BGM was very forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- 8\\n\r\nHaruka - \"The Air-head Main Character\" - she starts off as your typical airhead, big-boobed high school girl, she's pretty possessive. I like how she always keeps Yuu all to herself.\\n\r\nYuu- \"The Main Character's Love Interest\" - the \"moe\" character, and a tsundere, i hate tsunderes but, i was okay with Yuu, there were lots of times that i felt sorry Haruka for putting up with Yuu.\\n\r\nShizuku - \"The Other Moe Character\" - just like Yuu she's in a secret relationship with Kotone and they both dislike it... sometimes.\\n\r\nKotone- \"The Ojou-sama Character\" - she had this Ojou-sama aura the first time i saw her, and i was right. Like Haruka, she's pretty and has a nice body and is in a secret relationship with Shizuku.\\n\r\nYuzu - \"The Energetic Boke\" - energetic, at first i thought she'd hit it up with Kaede, but they're both straight, so no.\\n\r\nKaede - \"The Sadistic Tsukkomi\" - ahhh, i was surprised by Kaede's character development, she was a normal girl at the start, but she changed throughout the series. She's probably the only one who had character development.\\n\\n\r\nOthers:\\n\\n\r\nMitsuki - \"Ms. Perfect Seitokaichou\" - i was actually surprised at this character, who'd knew she'd have a \"competition\" with her little sister, Yuu.\\n\r\nSumisumi - to be honest, i don't have a classification for her, she came out pretty late in the series but, she's like Yuzu; \"An energetic boke.\"\\n\r\nRina - \"The Secretary\" - hmmm... how should i describe her? Rina's pretty much your ordinary girl, she doesn't have any unique characteristics.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8: Whenever they Kiss, i squeal, that's how much i enjoyed it.\\n\r\nBut some jokes, fall of the mark, but hey, not all jokes hit, and sometimes the missed jokes are the most funny ones.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- 8: This anime shares the generic Boke-Tsukkomi-Air-head-Ojou-sama/Ms.Perfect-Moe that every Slice of Life/all-girl anime, but what makes it different? It's straight up Shoujo-Ai, no one needs to wear Yuri Goggles to make Yuri couples here.\\n",

            "content": "This right here is a cult classic, a chef d'oeuvrea buried under erroneous preconceptions and unfounded criticism. This gem is obscured because it does not shine; it is buried because its tone is that of abyssal black. Sakura Trick pries into to the darkest corners of our subconscious, the most visceral of our cognition, the most carnal of our urges, and the most primal of our instincts. Its sublimity will ever be debated yet always remain objectively irrefutable; the fundamental insight it provides into human and perhaps animalistic nature may shape the basis of sexual psychoanalysis for millennia to come. \r\nSuperficially, Sakura Trick appears tobe an anime which caters to the most lowly and deprived among men; conceited critics dismiss it as such often without a second thought. As self-important as these self-proclaimed critics are, they fail to realize that Sakura Trick is indeed a trick, and they are the ones being tricked. Sakura petals, or cherry blossoms, are commonly associated with a sense of beauty and innocence in Japanese culture. As discussed by Ango Sakaguchi in Sakura no Mori no Mankai no Shita, sakura petals are often a means to enhance and stylize the atmosphere of a scene, be it melancholic, resplendent or sensual. Used famously in 5 Centimeters per Second, the sakura petals constructs an immense yet artificial atmosphere which proved successful in fooling the average fool incapable of critical analysis. What most critics fail to realize, however, is that Sakura Trick is playing them beyond this level. The entire visible layer of Sakura Trick is a euphemistic veil obfuscating the dark and uncanny human psyche which it explores; any tangible material is a metaphor for its meticulous meta-analysis of the metaphysical mentality\u2019s pubertal metamorphosis. \\n\\n\r\nAs brilliantly put by Charles Baudelaire, \u201cLa sexualit\u00e9 est le lyrisme des masses.\u201d In Ulysses, James Joyce subverts gender conceptions by deconstructing sexual stereotypes; in Lolita, Vladimir Nobakov delves into the abnormal perversion of hebephilia; in Doctor Glas, Hjalmar Soderberg studies sexual catharsis through murder; in Aquarion EVOL, Shoji Kawamori studies the manifestation of repressed sexuality as love. Time and again, great thinkers have demonstrated the immense potential of sexual psychoanalysis in narrative form. \\n\\n\r\nSakura Trick fulfills this potential. \\n\\n\r\nThe exterior plotline of Sakura Trick is straight forward - two damsels unknowingly in love with each other: Sonoda Yuu and Takayama Haruka, start high school in the same class with four other apparent lesbians. This premise alone poses innumerable questions of pertinence - most of which are problematized further and explored as the series progresses. Why are two girls romantically interested in each other? Why are there four more girls of questionable sexual orientation in their class? Were they perhaps influenced by Haruka\u2019s and Yuu\u2019s display of intimacy, implying a nurture over nature determination of sexuality? Do their behaviors suggest abnormalities in their amygdala activity, or is such behavior governed by the wider cerebral hemispheres?  Hailed as the father of psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud once said, \u201cThe sexual life of adult women is a dark continent for psychology.\u201d The stringency and inadaptability of the traditional approach practiced by psychologists is to blame for this. Sakura Trick is unshackled from such rigidities - by investigating high school girls in late puberty, a time and setting in which sexuality is at its most volatile, and doing so through homosexuality rather than the vapid norm, it sheds light on the enigma which has eluded psychologists for centuries.  \\n\\n\r\nPerhaps most imperative and counter-intuitive of all, Sakura Trick investigates male sexuality through the scope of lesbianism. Je veux te baiser, baisez-moi! What is the sexual appeal in a couple which can only engage in abortive reproduction? When exposed to intercourse in explicit yuri, it is plausible that lust for the opposite gender can override the notion of evolutionary feasibility. Despite the lack of explicit intercourse in Sakura Trick, male viewers nonetheless experience a craving for the girls\u2019 well-being instead of jealousy and contempt for one of them as would be rational. This paradox challenges not only the Darwinian theories of evolution, but also Freud\u2019s theories of sexuality. He wrote, \u201cA man's heterosexuality will not put up with any homosexuality, and vice versa.\u201d Sakura Trick proves the exact contrary: heterosexual men more than put up with the homosexuality in the series. According to psychologist Henry Havelock Ellis, \u201cReproduction\u2026 is highly complex and not yet clearly understood. It is not necessarily connected with sex, nor is sex necessarily connected with reproduction.\u201d Havelockian philosophy noticeably makes its mark in Sakura Trick; by taking hold of this anomaly in human behaviour and untangling its implications, it explores the darkest depths of our consciousness which borders between flesh and mind. \\n\\n\r\nIn his essay The Sexual Abberations, Freud discusses human disposition to perversions, including hebephilia, as an original and universal disposition of the human sexual instinct which is not limited to the psychologically ill. Sakura Trick takes this theory beyond mere discourse and puts it into practice. The characters in Sakura Trick are impeccably crafted, not only in their characterization and likability but primarily in their support of the series\u2019 psychological study. Rather than each being equipped with sexually inviting traits, some characters are simply \u201ccute\u201d, for lack of a less vulgar word. A certain je ne sais quoi of the girls are successful in generating not just physical, but more importantly emotional cravings from the audience. \\n\\n\r\nThe brilliant technique of Sakura Trick\u2019s probing into the atavistic lust is most aptly demonstrated through the analysis of the two main characters: Haruka and Yuu. On the one hand, Haruka is characterized by her lascivious and manipulative personality, pneumatic figure, seductive voice, and red hair indicative of her prurience. In contrast, Yuu has an innocent demeanor, underemphasized curves, a sweet voice characterized by childlike tenderness, and bright amber hair adorned with flowers \u2013 all of which are suggestive of a girl in the early stages of puberty. By contrasting these dichotomous traits, Sakura Trick follows in the wake of Vladimir Nobakov and his analysis of the abominable erotic attraction to the so called \u201cnymphets\u201d. A range of recent research by neurologists suggest paedophilia\u2019s origin as a deep-rooted predisposition that does not change, rather than the previous theory of causation by psychological influences. Perhaps influenced by this paradigm shift, Sakura Trick attempts what has never been done before \u2013 bringing out, in men, pseudo-paedophilic reactions to girls older than the previously stipulated plateau age of thirteen. This is achieved through the stark contrast between Haruka\u2019s maturity and Yuu\u2019s infantility which tampers with the viewers\u2019 preset dispositions. The additional fact that it succeeds in bringing out such abnormal responses not only in the susceptible older population, but chiefly among the young, truly underscores the groundbreaking impact of Sakura Trick.\\n\\n\r\nLa peinture parle d'elle-m\u00eame, il n'y a rien \u00e0 dire; to describe the artistic qualia of Sakura Trick would be to describe colour to the blind, wisdom to the young, or life to the unliving. The artistic eminence of this series is utterly unparalleled. The visuals are primarily based on a minimalistic design reminiscent of Frank Stella\u2019s later paintings, yet some of the most visceral moments of the series display a paradoxical resemblance to abstract expressionism. This visual style is augmented by subtly and tactfully altering its background or occasionally foreground objects into abstract patterns or drawings depending on the situation and atmosphere. Certain patterns such as polka dots reoccur frequently throughout the series, showing inspirations from early pop-art but crafting a style most avant la lettre. In a masterful display of expertise in art-direction, these aesthetic shifts are extremely frequent yet uncontrived and never interfere with the viewers\u2019 immersion. This enigmatic and radical style vividly complements the metaphysical nature of the series, reinforcing its character as an original pastiche of the post-modernist movement. It is an embodiment and perfection of the ideals that SHAFT had in mind for but failed to accomplish in their shows such as the Monogatari Series and Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei. \\n\\n\r\nAnother of Sakura Trick\u2019s aesthetic perks is its use of letterboxing: further cinematic flare is added to the already immersive series through the occasional framing of the video in bars. However, in an bold act of defiance and subversion, Sakura Trick makes use of white bars rather than the traditional black. In addition exuding an ephemerally fey charm, the white letterboxing holds several implications that one may only speculate on. Does it symbolize the series\u2019 immense depth as it creates a dual-layered letterboxing on monitors which do not match its aspect ratio? Does its brightness reflect the series\u2019 enlightening exploration of the previously unknown? Does it indicate the series\u2019 nature as an antithesis to conventional psychology? Incidentally, Sakura Trick shows an abnormal and seemingly perverse focus on the characters thighs. In any other context, this would be plain pandering to the lowest common denominator. Nevertheless, when contextualized in sexual analysis one will realize the use of thighs as a study of fetishistic reactions to sexually inert objects. Sakura trick is sublime not only in the depth of its investigation, but also in its breadth.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment may be a pivotal factor of anime-viewing for the ordinary viewer. For experienced critics such as I, however, examining a show of such depth and complexity brings only misery and agony (which true intellectuals welcome, mind you). Attempts at analyzing Sakura Trick\u2019s implications and unraveling its messages necessitate great concentration and effort, which is further exacerbated when so much of my blood flows elsewhere than my brain when viewing this show. As studied in neuromagnetic stimulations, encumbering the brain to a great extent can be a cause for physical pain. We critics are martyrs \u2013 through our self-sacrifice we free plebeians of their ignorance and ablute them of their sins. \\n\\n\r\nThere have been numerous undisputable masterpieces among anime, such as the Ishihaya Tatsuya\u2019s strikingly realistic classic Clannad or the tactique extraordinaire Code Geass by Taniguchi Goro. Sakura Trick will not join their ranks; its surface is too generic, its themes too provocative, and its messages too obscure. It will remain underground \u2013 treasured by the most avant-garde among intellectuals for its edifying if horrifying insight into the fundaments of sexuality. Philistines and self-proclaimed critics alike will shun Sakura Trick, but you can\u2019t fault them for that. It takes boundless wisdom to appreciate its subtleties, and courage to side with the unpopular opinion. Sed domi maneas paresque nobis novem continuas fututiones. The time of Sigmund Freud\u2019s sovereignty over psychoanalysis has passed; Sakura Trick is the herald of a new era that is to come.\\n",

            "content": "When it comes to Anime, implied sexual attraction between two female characters is an often repeated trend. The main issue here is the word \"implied.\" Very rarely are we treated to a blatant representation of lesbian couples, and the most we get are vague undertones that are just sort of there in the background. This stirs the audience's imagination, while still playing it safe at the same time. It's a real shame, because this squanders golden opportunities for presenting unique relationships that could potentially result in more memorable characters. Sure, Yuri series have been done before, but just try finding more than a couple ofexamples from the past few years. If you're not looking through Hentai, it isn't easy. Sakura Trick is a rare gem that isn't afraid to go all out, as if in direct opposition to the current trends. With its cast of colorful characters, along with an intimate romance that has the ability to melt the hearts of countless viewers, Sakura Trick offers solid proof that there is too much untapped potential present in the Yuri genre for it to keep being neglected any further.\\n\\n\r\nThere isn't any overarching story present in Sakura Trick, as is usually the case with Slice of Life series taking place at high school. Instead, each episode is divided up into two segments that depict a different day from Haruka and Yuu's first year of school as they deal with the comical situations that their budding relationship gets them into, as well as the complications that inevitably arise along the way. The first segment lasts for around half an episode, and then the second takes up the remaining run-time while covering a different scenario. Despite this, the pacing for each part isn't as fast as you would expect. A lot is packed into twenty minutes, but there's plenty of slow and easy-going moments that will make you feel very comfortable with the way things are proceeding. While some may view the lack of a concrete story as a negative point, it's clear that Sakura Trick's priorities lie with the characters and their romantic development.\\n\\n\r\nAs the main couple of the show, Haruka and Yuu get the most time in the spotlight. Haruka is very possessive of Yuu, and gets jealous whenever others get too close. She's very assertive, but never to the point where she does anything that Yuu wouldn't be okay with. She also has a very overactive imagination, leading to some of the best comedic moments of the show. Her perverted fantasies make her a far more realistic character, as they mirror the thoughts that any young girl might have towards the person that they like. Yuu on the other hand, has a more stubborn personality, and isn't as honest with herself as Haruka is. This results in some great progression later on, as Yuu begins to express herself to Haruka in more direct ways. The contrast between Haruka and Yuu makes their unique form of love all the more fascinating to watch, and at no point does it feel unnatural that they are together.\\n\\n\r\nYuu's older sister Mitsuki provides needless conflict to Haruka and Yuu's relationship, but still manages to be likable in her own right. She forms a crush on Haruka, and struggles to come to terms with her newly found affection. The issue is that this creates a bit of unnecessary drama later on, which just feels out of place in a show that was doing so well without it.\\n\\n\r\nHaruka and Yuu are joined by a circle of close friends that liven up their high school days. Noda Kotone is a rich, playful girl who lives her life to the fullest in order to leave no regrets behind. She is staying at the same house as the quiet and reserved Shizuku, who doesn't have much of a presence. Eventually a love forms between the two of them as well. The few scenes that they share together are some of the cutest of the whole show, so it's really a shame that more episodes weren't devoted to expanding upon their relationship. The last two characters are Kaede and Yuzu, who are mostly present to provide their own wacky sense of humor. They play their roles near-perfectly, but they're definitely low on the show's priority list. For what little screen time they share alone together, they are given a fair amount of depth. Without these supporting characters, Sakura Trick would lose a large piece of what makes it so enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nSakura Trick is renowned for its adorable romance, and this is one area where it really shines. If you want to see some heartfelt moments between two lovers, this series has you more than covered. It doesn't take much to throw two characters on screen and have them kiss, and indeed Sakura Trick does do this, but there's a reason why it works so well. It's because the emotions feel genuine. Haruka and Yuu share a relationship greater than that of two random girls making out solely to appeal to the male demographic. This isn't some forced, fake romance--it's real.\\n\\n\r\nThere are numerous examples that establish  the authenticity of these feelings. We can tell that Haruka cares more about Yuu's happiness than her own. She'll go out of her way to form a study group when Yuu is having trouble in class, and she'll make an appeal to the student council to have a cheering squad just so Yuu can fulfill her dream of being a cheerleader. It's the same with Yuu, who despite getting into quarrels with Haruka, always has her in mind. She knows Haruka really values their kisses, so even though she has a more passive personality, she tries her best to take the initiative. It's because of this mutual affection that a mere kiss can become something truly special. The fact that Sakura Trick didn't stop at pointless fan service and went that extra mile by presenting a believable romance reveals that the creators had more than just money on their minds. Other romance series can take a few pointers from the pure, consensual love present in Sakura Trick.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're after a few laughs, Sakura Trick will most likely satisfy in that department. This show is based off of the original 4-koma manga, where a joke needs to be effectively executed in a mere four panels, so extra care is put into each and every punchline. It never feels like a joke was thrown in just for the heck of it, and some even reveal quite a bit about the characters involved. Unfortunately, there are a few cliches and repetitive jokes, such as misunderstandings between characters, mixed in with the more well-written material. Overall, I wouldn't say the comedy is anything entirely new or groundbreaking, but the characters are what really make it work.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of effort was put into Sakura Trick's animation, and it shows in all the right ways. Vivid colors are used to emphasize the characters' unique personalities, while the backgrounds are less detailed but focus more on creating a calming atmosphere that make watching very easy on the eyes. If you notice any similarities to another major animation studio, then you aren't imagining things. Studio DEEN uses many of Shaft's techniques, to the point where you'd think it was a Shaft work before looking it up. It closely mimics many aspects of the popular series Hidamari Sketch (the primary reason being that the same director was involved);  it uses the same quick scene transitions and sound effects,  as well as symbols used on screen to represent the position or introduction of a character. Because of this, Sakura Trick fails to establish its own identity in the visuals department. They aren't exactly terrible though, and anyone unfamiliar with Shaft's works will still be able to appreciate them.\\n\\n\r\nOn the subject of visuals, I should also note that the fan service can really get obnoxious at times. The camera just loves to focus on bouncing breasts and the thighs of characters at the most unfitting times. This is one of the major reasons why I couldn't bring myself to fully enjoy the show. Sure, it's nowhere near as bad other current shows, but those looking for a completely pure experience will sadly be disappointed by this fact.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound itself is unremarkable, with the exception of the soft piano and violin tracks that play during romantic scenes. The opening and ending themes will be catchy enough to stay stuck in your head for a while, and I'd say that they are what stand out the most. The voice actors also put on a above-average performance, especially Iguchi Yuka as Yuu and Tomatsu Haruka as Haruka.\\n\\n\r\nSakura Trick is one of my favorite romance anime to come out in recent years. It's much more than mindless fan service devoid of any sort of substance, and actually portrays a love that feels both endearing and natural. While each character has their own flaws, it only makes them feel more human and less like an uninspired cardboard cutout. Sakura Trick is a step in the right direction for romance shows, and for Yuri in general. Hopefully it will inspire others to create better stories that depict this often neglected form of love. I certainly hope that time comes soon.",

            "content": "At the start of the season, Sakura Trick came in strong. While there has been tons of yuri undertones in anime, characters with physically intimate relationships are still pretty rare, so seeing two high school girls locking fingers and making out was what one would consider \"the bees knees\", and animation segues in vain of Hidamari Sketch, and even the same DIRECTOR? Hell yeah. Sign me up. This could never get tiring, right?\r\nTurns out, it takes a mere half a season for it to go from a novelty to a daily routine. After a dozen and half make out sessions, they stop meaning anything andbegin to seem like a time filler. Beyond LESBIANS~, you are stuck with a cast of characters who are, quite frankly, dull as dishwater. Too much time is squandered away on Haruka, Yuu, and Mitsuki, and the rest of the supporting cast don't get enough individual screen time for themselves or to even get a chance to develop their own side-stories that aren't resolved instantaneously.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the OP and ED are high energy, the actual OST is rather serene, giving scenes that require a higher tempo BG no punch, and at times, comes off as dissonant with the activities and dialogs being exchanged. Even if backed by a proper OST, it still wouldn't help because gags are too seldom and too few warrant a chuckle.\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals are fine, but mostly because it's similar to Hidamari Sketch, except heavily indentured. Part of Hidamark Sketch's charm was the odd animation segues, cutaways, and minimalism. The SHAFTisms separated it from its other SoL peers. Unfortunately, Studio Deen isn't SHAFT. They're a poor company who make low budget garbage like Hetalia, Higurashi, and Pupa, so we're left with the most basic fragments of Hidamari-esque cutaways. Instead of attempting to reinvent Hidamari's SHAFTisms, it's more than content to copycat them very, very poorly. Aside from those little touches, the coloring, while a nice change from many shows that use bright hues, can contribute to the malaise I was feeling as I powered through each episode week after week. The animation is what you would expect from a low-tier studio: most average, but spotty. In terms of quality, it's pretty high end for Studio Deen, so I guess congrats on not making something that looks like complete pigshit for once?\\n\\n\r\nBy the end of the season, watching Sakura Trick went from how I kicked off waking up at God-knows-what-hour on Friday mornings to go to college into a chore that I would hold off for several days, finished only out of obligation for coming so far. I really did want the novelty to never die. I really did want to like the characters and find them interesting, but as episode 12 was coming to a close, I had my epiphany: This show is boring as shit.",

            "content": "Sakura Trick is a refreshingly different Slice of life show, it throws away the concept of static timelines often seen in SOL shows, there is continuity between each episode and changes in each character and their relationships, minor or major, can be felt together with the passage of time. \r\nThe show presents to us a cast of multifaceted characters and the relationships they share, not solely romantic bonds, but also the ties between friends and between sisters. \r\nWhat I loved most in the show was how it built on its characters. Sakura Trick avoids the use of heavy dialogue and inner monologue as a meansof developing it's characters. Instead, the characters change subtly with the happenings of each episode, leaving space for interpretation on the part of the viewer as well as giving it a natural feel.  \\n\\n\r\nFor example, as Mitsuki says, Yuu is often not honest with her true feelings, this is something we see through her actions rather than words. I'll give a minor spoiler to illustrate this point. \\n\\n\r\nThis trait can been seen from the very start when Yuu makes a phone call to Haruka. She 'checks on' Haruka and quickly hangs up as if just doing a routine check, but the fact that she was awake past midnight and that she called Haruka with nothing substantial to say gives away the excitement she's hiding, she's starting her life as a High School Student after all. \\n\\n\r\nThe way the show dealt with dramatic scenes was another thing I liked. There is no reliance on contrived situations nor do they blow mundane problems out of proportion in Sakura Trick. Tense situations are resolved quickly and the characters avoid escalating the issue. Presenting drama this way feels much more natural.  \\n\\n\r\nSome might see this as weak storytelling but I would argue in the opposite direction. Because of the show's episodic nature, there is a tendency to dismiss that each scene has significance beyond their respective episodes, but as I previously pointed out, the characters change subtly with each event, the feelings they experience at each point weighs on them and affects the way that they behave. \\n\\n\r\nIt's easy to overgeneralize and dismiss the series as purely fan service. Fanservice is present, in terms of selective shots, but this does not distort the characters. Some dumb down the kissing to being a service for the viewers, completely overlooking the relationship between Yuu and Haruka and the emotions which drive each kiss.\\n\\n\r\nIf you do plan to pick up this series, try to look at it from your own perspective. Look at the characters as real people rather than try to stereotype them.",

            "content": "Sakura Trick is a weird one. \r\nFor starters, if you dont enjoy yuri at all, it wont reccomend you to try this one out. \r\nThe main focus is yuri fanservice after all. There is a story with romance, BUT, the way it is executed is poorly most of the times. So again dont like yuri?! SKIP THIS!\r\nNow, I said it was a yuri fanservice, so what can you expect, if you do enjoy yuri like myself??\r\nEvery episode is divided by 2 mini episodes, most of the times, each has a different kind of mini arc story going on.\r\nAnd for the most part, in each ofthese mini episodes, you can expect some hot yuri scene, there is no mature content here. but the anime doesnt really need it to show its yuri colours, and if you enjoy those, you gonna love when those happen, be flustered even. Honestly some may think of it, like a hentai anime or something to satisfy your \"needs\", whatever yours are.\\n\r\nBut with time, I came to realize it was actually heartwarming for the most part.\\n\r\nThe animation is simply, yet enjoyable, and great on the yuri scenes and the sound fits the atmosphere, parts of the OP and ED were very catchy, thought most of the times I only heard the intros for each, then skipped the rest...\\n\r\nArt 9 & Sound 8.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo where did this yuri anime, which seems to have potential by what I wrote failed??\\n\\n\r\nLets start with the characters, there is not much complexity to each, not really cliche, but still, while the MCs became more decent with time, everything just feels like, \"oh, it is another all school girls Slice of Life\". Most of the stuff are pretty silly, so the characters had potential to more, but failed to reach it, they stand to support the \"story\" and the yuri romantic scenes, and for the most part, while the cast is decent for a yuri anime... that is it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd where comes the big downer for the anime. The story!\\n\r\nI m sure the anime follows faithfully the nature of the origin source, the manga. But by doing so, due to its nature of storytelling, there is almost no sense off progression overall! I dont hate episodic anime, but for a romantic story, it feels kinda lackluster, each episode has its story happening, that for most part seem not to be connected, with some exceptions like the last 2 episodes.\\n\r\nI kinda enjoyed the first episode, and was expecting to get that feeling of progression, that makes you want to see the next episode, to continue the story!\\n\r\nGenerally what happened to me was, \"gotta progress on Sakura Trick, meh, there is no plot, besides Yuri that I dont feel in the mood for now, what is compelling me to go at it?? Then seeing it, cute yuri!! YESS!... It is over, lets see what is next on my list.\" That kinda of thing, not memorable at all, a good story makes you want to keep reading it, keeps you wishing to see what will the plot next infold into.\\n\r\nAnd so... it kills alot of the potential the anime could have, has a proper story, it really does. Okay, most yuri suck, but I have seen some with better stories than this one! And when well explored, the romantic yuri scenes, with proper drama, character and story development, those can became very addicting, a compelling and enjoyable experience, that will make all its yuri fanbase, experiencing lots and lots of doki doki moments!\\n\r\nSo, while the story had its moments, it was for the most part mediocre, which if viewed mostly for people that dont enjoy yuri, as trash.\\n\r\nStory 5!\\n\\n\\n\r\nWith that left behind, I m a yuri lover after all, so while the story sucked, and probably one of the worst story developments I have seen in an anime yet in these recent years (lucky me, there are worst...), the yuri yuri doki doki scenes, the lighthearted aspect and Yuu and Haruka relationship that while nonsensical at parts, was enjoyable and cute to watch.... all in all, it shined for me at certain moments, and I kinda got surprise that there is lots of yuri every since the beggining, while at most yuri content, you gotta get over alot of progression to start seeing the good stuff. This one, says \"Like yuri yuri?? Here take it! Make sure you get your hunger for cute yuri filled, we will not mercilessly make you beat around the bush for longer, enjoy!\". Despite the faults, I did enjoyed the anime.\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it will came to be a very polarised experience, it firstly depends of the basis of you enjoying yuri romance, or not.\\n\r\nAnd then even if you do enjoy, being honest, it could had been so much more.\\n\r\nIf only the main aspect, what supports the overall progression you will have with Sakura Trick, the story, didnt fell flat on its face, and the overall cast together had more complexity... I could only imagine, but it would be a really great interesting yuri for sure! \\n\r\nI know it, probably is just the format of the manga, but has I have not yet read it, I dont know if it works there.\\n\r\nIf it did, that doesnt means it would surely work with the anime adaptation. So maybe they could had changed, and added more stuff to the adaptation?! \\n\r\nAn adaptation doesnt need to be 100% original to its story, IF what is changed/added is for an overall better experience with the adaptation versus the original work...\\n\\n\r\nI m glad yuri seems to be taking more prominience nowadays, but I hope others learn from Sakura's mistakes, and its virtues, and someday make story that fully fleshs out and explores the genre's potential.",

            "content": "Something that I find fairly interesting about Sakura Trick is the title itself. What comes to mind when \"Sakura Trick\" is uttered? Sakura, which is a flower with a lovely shade of bright pink, and trick, a fake-out of sorts, which may contain mischievous undertones. What was the inspiration for the name of this title? Every time I see this title, I can't help but feel like I'm about to stumble upon a beautiful disaster, or a \"sakura-colored trick,\" if you will. Of course, the term \"trick\" can also be defined in other ways, but for the purpose of stating an argument, the previously stateddefinition will be used.\\n\\n\r\nThe \"trick\" in this case, would be the underlying messages that accompany Sakura Trick. On the surface, this title is about two girls who attend a school that is slated to be closed (though, this holds no importance), and decide one day, by complete chance, to kiss each other, in order to strengthen their relationship. Once this happens, their relationship becomes more than that of ordinary friends, as they cannot seem to get through an episode without kissing seven times.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the kissing between two teenage girls itself is the main factor of the show, it is also by far the worst problem this show has. Not in the kissing itself, but the way it is presented. Contrary to popular media, love is not a drug, and the act of kissing shouldn't be compared to that of taking cocaine. What Sakura Trick does so well is displaying a strange, relieving sense of tranquility while the kiss is going on. Feelings of anticipation, slight awkwardness, and a genuine amount of affection can be felt during (roughly) all of the kissing scenes, and not always necessarily between the two main characters. Despite this, it's both predictable and out of nowhere. When an opportunity arises where the two main characters can be alone, the audience knows they will take it, and the audience know they will kiss, regardless of whether or not the mood suits it. It starts to become the only reason this show has any airtime. This is where the \"trick\" comes into play.\\n\\n\r\nThe two characters that kiss most often are Haruka and Yuu, and are assigned as the show's main protagonists. When these two characters are with each other, they act as though they're a couple, except they aren't. Though, when surrounded by friends, they show discretion, almost as if their kissing is a secret from everyone. Oh wait, it is. Something to note about the characters in this series is that they try to be funny. They try to make the audience laugh and feel good about any situation. Though this might cause the audience to not take anything seriously, there's a larger problem: the characters are dull. Try as they may, most of the jokes aren't that funny. When Sakura Trick decides to spend more time \"developing\" the relationship between Haruka and Yuu, they brush off other characters to do so, lest the secondary characters have a romantic relationship of their own (all characters are female, by the way). This leaves any screentime not dedicated to girls kissing much to be desired.\\n\\n\r\nThe \"sakura\" within this trick comes through with the animation style. Upon watching this, I would've bet my house that the animation studio responsible for Sakura Trick was Shaft. I was pleasantly surprised when I found out Studio Deen was responsible, as they seemed to dabble in Shaft's mannerisms within Sakura Trick. The art style and design of the entire show will at least keep an audience attentive. There are multiple examples of quick, transitional frames that showcase a character's personality well. Yuu's signature flower clip is shown prevalently throughout, and I could tell that the animators had fun stylizing the characters' features to their whim. It helps an already dull cast of characters seem full of life and charm.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the animation is fun and the kissing scenes are nothing but passionate, Sakura Trick is conveniently named as a trick. The entire concept of the show and its emphasis on two girls kissing feels shallow altogether, and a lot like bait. Any redeeming factors this show has is muddled down by tryhard dialogue and bland characters. Only the final two episodes of Sakura Trick try to deal with the relationship of Haruka and Yuu in a mature manner, but by then, the damage has already been done. It's a show one can turn their brain off to, through and through. But it's not like we have enough series like that already, right?",

            "content": "Sakura Trick is a yuri anime from this year, started in January finished in March. The manga it's based on was written and drawn by Tachi and the anime version was handled by Studio Deen. Studio Deen has done several yuri series/ series with heavy yuri content before. Including Maria sama ga Miteru, Yamibo and Simoun. So far, none of these series have been bad, although some have come closer than others. That being said, Studio Deen has done some pretty egregious anime in other genres. Such as Kore wa Zombie desu ka. Still, they do have a pretty good record so I'm cautiously optimisticabout this one. \\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nOur story begins with a group of students entering their first year of High School. Haruka and Yuu, two girls who attended Middle School together, end up in the same class, but on opposite ends of the room. Haruka sees Yuu link arms with other girls and runs to an empty classroom, feeling dejected. Yuu follows to apologise, having known in advance that her actions would make Haruka jealous. The two have a conversation during which Haruka reveals that she thought they were special to each other. Yuu argues that they are and she will prove it by doing something with Haruka that she wouldn't do with anyone else. This leads to the two of them kissing rather passionately. \\n\\n\r\nThis has, quite possibly, the fastest hook up I've ever seen in a romance series, with the two leads getting together right away. Most of the series involves them and their friends getting into shenanigans with the two of them trying to hide their relationship while sneaking kisses. In fact, I don't think there's a single episode without Haruka and Yuu kissing at some point. Sakura Trick is something of a rarity since the tension doesn't come from how the two leads will get together. Rather, it comes from two sources. The first being whether or not they'll get found out. The second being that Mitsuki, Yuu's older sister, also develops romantic feelings for Haruka. That's going to make family gatherings awkward. Honestly, I prefer this type of narrative to the more traditional one. If you're watching a romance, you know that the leads are almost certainly going to hook up eventually and it can just get annoying watching or reading a bunch of material that teases about it. At least this format dispenses with all that crap and just lets you enjoy the cute elements of their relationship while also providing some story threads for tension that basic pattern recognition doesn't instantly give you the conclusions for. So, the tension does work pretty effectively, even if most of the series is more dedicated to cutesy or comedic slice of life moments. \\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of comedic elements in this series and, as a whole, they're really well done. Just about every joke hits the mark and there aren't any that don't at the very least elicit a smile. The relationship between Haruka and Yuu is positively adorable. The series also manages to have a narrative that flows pretty smoothly in spite of the episodes being largely unconnected. There's a very clear chronology for the series. \\n\\n\r\nThere's really only one problem with the narrative. Unfortunately, it's a pretty major one. There's a secondary romantic couple with two of Haruka and Yuu's friends, Kotone and Shizuku. The problem is that Kotone and Shizuku are cousins. In all fairness, they don't get a huge amount of screen time, but it's still really disturbing every time they get a scene. The worst part is that there doesn't seem to be any awareness that this is a bad idea. It's treated as \u201ccute\u201d within the series. Because when I think of cousins snogging, I think \u201coh, cute.\u201d Oh, wait, I don't because it's not cute. It's just messed up. There's not even a good reason for them to be cousins. They could've been childhood friends and it would've made no difference to their story arc.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this are really good, overall. Haruka and Yuu are adorable and have great interactions. The major side characters like Mitsuki, Kaede and Yuzu are a lot of fun. Even Kotone and Shizuku have some good character moments if you can ignore their disturbing relationship. Now, the side characters tend to be pretty much non-entities, the teacher, Rina, Sumi and several others. They don't exactly feel like one-dimensional stereotypes, but they come pretty close. Although, to be fair, they do have a purpose within the story even if it is a very small one and it would be highly unreasonable to expect every minor character in a twelve episode series to get developed. Furthermore, they do serve their functions just fine.\\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\\n\r\nThe art in this is kind of lazy. The character designs themselves are nice and there are some good sequences, particularly the way they animate the ending. However, the backgrounds are pretty bare and people who show up in the background are frequently drawn without any features. They're just kind of blank. The artists also dispense with any kind of detail for the backgrounds on several occasions, replacing them with colourful heart patterns or some such thing. \\n\\n\r\nThe worst factor in the artwork is the fan-service. There are a few scenes where they use it for the sake of a joke, but more often they just have random fan-service scenes or oddly angled shots for the sake of fan-service. Did they really think they needed to play up to the heterosexual male gaze in a series where girls frequently kiss each other? All the fan-service ultimately does is detract from the cutesy elements. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThere are some really good actresses in this. Our leads are played by Iguchi Yuka, who was also Mako in Girls und Panzer, and Tomatsu Haruka, who played Anjou in AnoHana. They both do a really superb job and really convey the chemistry between Yuu and Haruka perfectly. They also got Fujita Saki, Ymir in Shingeki no Kyojin, and Fuchigami Mai, who was Miho in Girls und Panzer as well as Alice in Doki Doki Precure. All the actresses do really well in their roles. The music is really good too, helping accentuate the mood. \\n\\n\r\nHo-Yay: \\n\\n\r\nThe ho-yay factor is going to be a 10/10. I know, the fact that this is a yuri romance probably clued you in. Haruka and Yuu have a really good relationship and it does develop and strengthen throughout the series.  We also get the kissing cousins, who I really don't want to discuss in any detail. Mitsuki's feelings for Haruka are also really well handled and lead to some good moments, both dramatic and comedic. Rina is also heavily implied to have feelings for Mitsuki, one of the only traits she has. Yuzu and Kaede have a really close relationship that could have pretty easily moved into romantic territory, but never does. \\n\\n\r\nWhy no, I don't find anything odd about there being no straight characters in the main cast. And no, I'm not just saying that because straight characters are rare in my own writing. Hurriedly changing the topic, Sakura Trick has a lot of affectionate scenes. As previously stated, pretty much every episode has a kiss at some point and there's also some hand holding, cuddling up and the like, but the series never moves into explicit sexual territory. It prefers to keep things cutesy. Which is  a good thing given that the characters are pretty young and cutesy material is far better suited for the atmosphere as a whole. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nSakura Trick is a pretty good romance. Yuu and Haruka make for an adorable couple, the comedy is effective and the sources of tension are really good. Still, the series is hurt by the secondary relationship between Kotone and Shizuku and the use of pandering fan-service. If you can forgive those problems, you will probably enjoy the series for its cute and funny moments as well as the romance between the two leads.  My final rating is going to be a 7/10. Next week I'll take a look at Kill La Kill.",

            "content": "~A personal journey into the world of forbidden love, buried under a pink veil~\r\nOn the surface, Sakura Trick doesn't seem like the kind of anime to have many unique or redeeming elements. Its vibrant, predominately pink colour scheme and slice of life presentation will impress nobody from a glance. With the further belittlement of the Shoujo and Yuri tag associations, its no wonder that few come to appreciate Sakura's delicacy.\r\nA lot of Sakura's strength is in its simplicity. It is an uplifting representation of Shoujo, that ironically plays no tricks. Its straightforward almost to a protesting, influential extent, and it exposes the genre from amultitude of viewpoints...\\n\r\nFrom the predictable Yuri-like intimacies, to the more heartfelt emotional friction between the characters - it may take a few episodes, but one can quite easily begin to appreciate the show's vivid, heart-warming, and surprisingly innocent nature.\\n\\n\r\nSakura goes on to quite vividly document through everyday life, the highs, lows, struggles and battles no matter how small-scale, from the perspectives of many; as the prominent relationship between the main characters evolves. Due to the (from a critical perspective) self-limiting simplicity of the show, it has to pay close attention to its detail - and this is exactly what it does to counter its endlessly rehashed premise.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is inescapably charming, cute, upbeat, very personal, very intimate, dramatic at times, but primarily... delicate (despite first impressions). Throughout, Sakura continuously flicks between casual slice of life-like presentation, with its fair share of comedy;  and romantic, more cinematic, serious, and emotionally-driven presentation. This variety adds to its realism and therefore immersion. It allows for the development of a distance between these stances, establishing more contrast, and giving the viewer a \"behind the scenes\" type feeling, an appreciation of the show's personal and intimate nature. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of presentation, the Art and Sound are flawless, and so despite the often associated one-dimensional nature of Shoujo shows, Sakura appears to know exactly what it is, and plays this mixture of controversy and deeper meaning into the content itself. I definitely was able to engage with the show, as i particularly liked the representation of the intimate awkwardness, and the forbidden, two-vs-society perspective.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said though, i won't deny that Sakura has minimal \"must keep watching\" factors, as the individual character development, alongside the story, is very simplistic. It only has power if you permit it to, and so a show where you are in control of your own engagement, is likely to bore those looking for a more dramatic romance. It's genuinely difficult to rate the show, as a lot can be read into it. If you're an interested SoL and/or Shoujo and/or Yuri fan, it's subjective, but give credit where its due, and you'll realize the beauty of this deceivingly cloudy-looking gem.",

            "content": "A love confession. A passionate kiss. That's something you usually get as a payoff of a romance story, right? Some kind of lovey-dovey epilogue might follow, but the story is about the road to love and all those intense, romantic scenes are its proper conclusion. That's standard.\r\nSakura Trick is not that, as clearly shown even by its opening. This series is pretty much all about teenage girls kissing and being awkwardly-romantic with each other. And even more kissing. Lots and lots of kissing. In various, not always justifiable situations. It features three couples, with one being pretty openly at it from the very beginning andthe other two blooming along the way, but without any deeper drama or doubt on what they are about. It's all very straightforward and fairly silly, just in the way you would expect this kind of purely-comedic show to be. \\n\\n\r\nHow about the execution? Well, the show is fairly pretty, often taking some minor shortcuts with animation and environment, but always solid with its main characters and when portraying more significant scenes (ex. kissing is always very detailed and colourful - the team behind Sakura Trick knew its priorities). The voices and op/end music are also fine. My main gripe is actually with the writing, which is serviceable, but never really great. Even this kind of fanservice'y show can be genuinely funny and witty, or even include some bits of believable romance. Here the jokes only ever got me smiling a bit, story didn't really go anywhere and the characters never even came close to Yuru Yuri levels of being memorable. While genuinely fun to watch, the whole experience felt pretty hollow. \\n\\n\r\nSo, is it worth your time? Your enjoyment will depend mostly on whether you like yuri and the kind of mild fanservice this show offers - while it has the main couple making out pretty much every episode, it actually rarely goes overboard with nudity or creepy shots you would know from other ecchi anime. I honestly thought that the kissing scenes will grow old pretty fast... But for me, they didn't. There's just this kind of cuteness and gentle sexiness in this brand of yuri fiction that always gets me, no matter how much of it I happen to see. Still, there's really very little substance to this show, even in comparison to many other episodic comedy anime I've seen. \\n\\n\r\nIf you're like me, starved for all kinds of yuri content, you should definitely watch it. If not... You won't lose that much by skipping it.",

This review is all 12 episodes, so it'll contain heavy spoilers. Overall I believe this anime is in my top two favorite animes. Trailing behind the greatest masterpiece of all time; School Days. If you have not seen my review on School days, I advise you to look at that first to have a good idea on how my reviews are. \r\nMoving on, Sakura Trick was first off, very enjoyable. My penis was hard 90% of thetime. I loved pressing my D against my dakimakura every time there was a yuri moment. The story was unbelievably amazing. It's obviously Slice of Life mixed with hot yuri scenes. What else could you ask for in the story? The plot twist at the end was just outrageous. Even though the best girl (in all of our opinions) didn't win, the story was fantastic. 10/10 No problem.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was immaculate. You could see the saliva exchanges in all of the kissing moments. That made my D REALLY hard. Did you even watch the OP? The art and animation on that shit was fucking amazing. When all of the girls were dancing naked, that just did it for me. I was instantly hooked. So it was an easy 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound was just as great. When the girls were kissing, you could hear the moans as if they were kissing another girl in real life. That's how I like my porn. I REALLY like hearing the girls do the nasty shit together. So I have no problem giving the sound a 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters and their development was just as beautiful. Watching Mitsuki develop her feelings really set the standard for me. After witnessing that greatness, I compare every anime to her. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI ENJOYED THE FUCK OUT OF THIS ANIME. I FUCKING PROMISE YOU'LL ENJOY IT AS MUCH AS I DID. I WANTED TO HAVE FAT LESBIAN YURI SHIT IN MY FACE SO THAT'S WHAT I GOT. I got to jack off a grand total of 15 times to this anime. What other anime or even hentai, could you say that about? You can't. Because the yuri scenes are absurdly great. My dick is waiting for something to top this shit. 10/10 overall. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading.",

            "content": "I\u2019m not usually into a yuri, but some cut-scenes appeal me enough to actually give it a try. I would say, this show has successfully done its magic to me. It's quite well known that giving a praise and high rating to this kind of anime is such a taboo, and here I am, doubting myself, asking myself the question : am I being biased? After some time of thinking, then I concluded, no! Judging an anime by its genre is as bad as judging a book by its cover. As a medium of art, anime allows for creators to express themselves the way theywant, and Sakura Trick, happens to be one unique and sweet experience that I enjoy so much.\\n\\n\r\nNow, what makes Sakura Trick stands as a great show? This really baffled me because I\u2019m unable to have a clear answer. Usually for anime that I enjoyed, I could readily pin point the good things about them, but this one is vague because at glance, all that can be seen from this anime is sweet and comedy. \\n\\n\r\nAfter some thought given, I think the one that appeal me the most is the light-hearted atmosphere that Sakura Trick has created. It\u2019s funny, hilarious, and non \u2013 logical, but at the same time, I felt it indirectly trying to show us how wonderful the world would be if we can just love each other. This realization makes me appreciate this anime even more, because I think it\u2019s a kind of critics for our society, who love the others only if certain conditions is met, whether it is social status, religion, interest, or anything else. Why can\u2019t we just love each other? Giving hugs and kisses? Should love only be limited to a couple? Why don\u2019t we make this world more wonderful with warm hugs? \\n\\n\r\nI would say, Sakura Trick had become the first yuri anime that I truly enjoyed.\\n",

This show centers around Haruka and Yu, who are close friends that become \"special friends\" (they make out with each other). That's the majority of the appeal of the show. If you like watching cute girls make out, this is a perfect anime for you.\r\nBeyond the surface level yuri, a lot of the scenes between the characters can actually be touching and sweet. The way the two main characters explore how they really feel about each other is very similar to what someone would experience in highschool, samesex relationship or not. The characters themselves are nothing too special, but their interactions seem mostly genuine and realistic.\\n\\n\r\nThe general story just follows the two main characters and their relationship together, but there are many scenes that seem forced for pointless. Visually, the show is nothing special. They attempt boob physics but it comes off more as comical than sensual. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this show is very enjoyable if you like drama and cute girls kissing. It is nothing special, but can put a smile on your face and pass the time.",

I truly believe this anime was just all about how many kiss scenes and how many yuri love doki doki moments they could have. And honestly, I'm fine with that, it's just that you can never take an anime seriously like that and that's also fine. But just don't expect some amazing story and plot development, just expect a LOT, of beautiful yuri moments. And trust me, you will be so happy ;)",

It was the first Shoujo-Ai anime i have watched since i finished Aoi Hana, and no, it's not implied Shoujo-Ai nor did it just give Shoujo-Ai undertones, it was 100% Shoujo-Ai all the way.\r\nArt - 8: I gave it an 8 because i rarely care about the art, as long as it was watchable i'm fine with it. Visual were okay, though the anime'sfluidity wasn't that good, not mediocre, mind you.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7: To be honest, the OP was cute, it had me singing along some times, but the BGM was very forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- 8\\n\r\nHaruka - \"The Air-head Main Character\" - she starts off as your typical airhead, big-boobed high school girl, she's pretty possessive. I like how she always keeps Yuu all to herself.\\n\r\nYuu- \"The Main Character's Love Interest\" - the \"moe\" character, and a tsundere, i hate tsunderes but, i was okay with Yuu, there were lots of times that i felt sorry Haruka for putting up with Yuu.\\n\r\nShizuku - \"The Other Moe Character\" - just like Yuu she's in a secret relationship with Kotone and they both dislike it... sometimes.\\n\r\nKotone- \"The Ojou-sama Character\" - she had this Ojou-sama aura the first time i saw her, and i was right. Like Haruka, she's pretty and has a nice body and is in a secret relationship with Shizuku.\\n\r\nYuzu - \"The Energetic Boke\" - energetic, at first i thought she'd hit it up with Kaede, but they're both straight, so no.\\n\r\nKaede - \"The Sadistic Tsukkomi\" - ahhh, i was surprised by Kaede's character development, she was a normal girl at the start, but she changed throughout the series. She's probably the only one who had character development.\\n\\n\r\nOthers:\\n\\n\r\nMitsuki - \"Ms. Perfect Seitokaichou\" - i was actually surprised at this character, who'd knew she'd have a \"competition\" with her little sister, Yuu.\\n\r\nSumisumi - to be honest, i don't have a classification for her, she came out pretty late in the series but, she's like Yuzu; \"An energetic boke.\"\\n\r\nRina - \"The Secretary\" - hmmm... how should i describe her? Rina's pretty much your ordinary girl, she doesn't have any unique characteristics.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8: Whenever they Kiss, i squeal, that's how much i enjoyed it.\\n\r\nBut some jokes, fall of the mark, but hey, not all jokes hit, and sometimes the missed jokes are the most funny ones.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- 8: This anime shares the generic Boke-Tsukkomi-Air-head-Ojou-sama/Ms.Perfect-Moe that every Slice of Life/all-girl anime, but what makes it different? It's straight up Shoujo-Ai, no one needs to wear Yuri Goggles to make Yuri couples here.\\n",

            "content": "[SPOILER FREE]\r\nI'm going to try to take this seriously because I have some serious thoughts about this story I'd like to share at the end.\r\nSakura Trick is an anime about two best friends just entering high school that kiss to solidify that their friendship is special and worth more than any other friendships they will make in an effort to keep their bond strong.\r\nAfter watching other anime where a romance subplot was always kind of a backdrop to divert the main story, you could effectively say that this is my first proper yuri romance anime.\r\nI'd like to point out that this is a very wholesomeanime, there is fan service present. But it is kept to what I consider an absolute minimum and is often handled in cliche-funny or clever ways. As someone who absolutely fucking despises mindless fan service, I really appreciated this approach.\\n\\n\r\nI liked a lot about it but it isn't flawless.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nSo in an effort to keep this as spoiler free as possible; I'm not going to give away any plot details and I'm going to talk very generally about the story. It's a cute anime, two best friends decide to kiss and this kiss leads to a spark that causes them to kiss and experiment more all while trying to keep their secret from their friends and family.\\n\r\nThis leads to a discussion about love and the different facets of it.\\n\r\nIt's incredibly cute and the writing makes the most out of the settings, creating a lot of unique, romantic, and touching moments. Sometimes it can feel a little generic and the dialogue can almost seem too idealized.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nThis anime is fucking beautiful. There's a fun use of character based backgrounds, creating reaction images using character features, and chibi visual skits. Nothing feels jarring and the animation has a very natural flow to it. At some points background characters are just white cutouts.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe VAs in this series were fine and I don't have any qualms about them. The music choices fit nicely with the scenes they were in and served an important role in setting the mood. There were a lot of moments where the soundtrack really shined.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\r\nThis is where I feel Sakura Trick suffers from the most. The female leads are very cute and their relationship dynamic works. But one of the leads is very airheaded and the other is more down to earth but easily swayed. This makes for a duo that can at times be annoying with childish antics and arguments. They aren't developed enough individually so most of the supporting characters and their relationships to each other are more fleshed out and more realistic than that of the protagonists. I think this is deliberately done and I'll get to why that is in the Overall portion.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI had a good time with this series and watching it all the way through was a breeze because of the pacing and how the plot develops. It's very memorable and even though I had minor complaints about some of the character's attitudes in certain situations I believe I'll be rewatching this again in the near future.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal Opinion:\\n\\n\r\nLove is a complicated emotion to describe. If you were to ask 100 people what they define as love you'd get a lot of different answers despite the feeling being the same. You can discover love in many ways, whether that's through art, music, work, or another person.\\n\\n\r\nSometimes love is like a Sakura tree. It grows slowly and sheds its petals in a short amount of time. But it still grows.\\n\r\nSometimes love is like a fucking semi hitting you at at 70mph and you can't describe how it felt, but you damn well know you felt it.\\n\\n\r\nI don't know if I would call Sakura Trick a love story.\\n\\n\r\nThe feelings the protagonists feel are compared and contrasted with the relationships others share in the series, and you can see how one couple's relationship has far more meaning and a deeper connection to them than our protagonists relationship has to them.\\n\\n\r\nIt seems very open to interpretation.\\n\\n\r\nI think this story is about two girls that find affection in one another through an unfamiliar act they had never explored before. These girls feel comfort in one another because they're thrust into a new situation without familiarity, so being together means they can find something to anchor them in this new place. This leads to experimentation and feelings that weren't discovered before. \\n\\n\r\nI don't believe that these protagonists are in love and it's clear at the end that they don't have a true understanding of what love is or means to them.\\n\r\nThe phrase \"I love you\" may illicit a positive response but without a proper understanding of what is meant by that the words hold less weight than they otherwise would.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I find this to be a cute, lighthearted story about teenagers on the path to self discovery and I enjoyed it.",

            "content": "II think the yuri animes that I have watched and I know have bunch of people in one place that are lesbians. Those animes are so unrealistic to the extent and it makes me grin in amusement. They exclude straight people right off the bat and fully focus only in the yuri part. Sakura Trick has a realistic touch that might happen to some of the people around their ages, or even older.\r\nThe storyline is fairly good; the slice of life comes in and realistic in some ways. We see high school student\u2019s daily lives and ups and downs can be seen in this anime,then how they struggle to their upcoming exams. Not only hets can engage into relationships, but also two of the same sex. Why I said it was realistic? Out 10 people at least 2 or 3 are into homosexuals. Sakura Trick did that seeing Haruka and Yuu and Kotone and Shizuku are in the same sex relationship while the others were normal. We also know how Yuu's sister, Mitsuki, is against them dating.  They present that dating two women isn't as seen as normal unlike the other yuri animes out there. That is crossing out the realism in the anime that makes it uninteresting for me, as if the only obstacles in that anime is that a rival between two women and setting aside realism. \\n\\n\r\nArt I love how unique the animation of this anime. Similar to Shaft's but Shaft has a greater animation and far greater than Studio Deen. Well it did catch my attention at least. Seeing Studio Deen is mimicking Shaft methods when they animate their animes =='.\\n\\n\r\nSound is fine I guess? Just average or below average for the opening and ending.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter is focused to Yuu and Haruka and a little of the other characters. We would love to see Kotone and Shizuku too, but neglected them for some reason; how disappointing. Haruka is assertive and Yuu is being so stubborn and not honest to her feelings. I love how Haruka's wild imagination kicks in and how Yuu's expectation exceeds.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment! Sure, the bouncing boobies and two little girls kissing haha. The moaning part damn why? That kills me! The jokes that really get through at least they try, better not having one.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10! This anime is a gem! It's so hard to find a real pure yuri anime anywhere. Only Hentais have I think? I don't go for hentai that's just too much. This is not just implied, but it is certainly in action. That's why it's 10/10!\\n",

            "content": "----------\r\nDisclaimer\r\n----------\r\nThe following review is completely spoiler-free, and is meant for users who are curious about whether to watch the show or not. While I write reviews with this focus, and the goal of presenting the show with little bias, it is impossible to write a completely unbiased review. Feel free to disagree with any of my opinions, and ultimately decide for yourself how you feel about the show after watching it yourself!\r\n---------\r\nPositives\r\n---------\r\n- Non-Implicit Romance\r\nBy far the largest reason I looked up this anime in the first place was because I was tired of romance sub-plots in many of the anime shows I loved. What Iwanted was a true romance; One that actually showed the trials and tribulations of a legitimate, blossoming coupling. Sakura Trick is exactly that. There's still some difficulties with admitting/telling others about the relationship, but overall it scratches the \"please I just want to see cute people get together and be in love\" itch that many of us get watching half-complete romance subplots in literally every show we ever watch. Incidentally, I would've written \"Explicit\" instead of \"Non-Implicit\", but I don't mean it like thaaaaat c'moon.\\n\\n\r\n- Overt Sexuality\\n\r\nThis could also be classified as a negative by some who are uncomfortable with the more intimate displays, but it was refreshing to see actual human signs of affection in the form of kissing (quite intense kissing at times). Anime has this weird double standard when it comes to displaying sexuality in its characters: It's okay to grope people and put their bodies on display, but heaven forbid you show them holding hands or kissing you absolute madman. Sakura Trick goes light on the boob grope and heavy on the petting, which I found to convey a more satisfying connection between the two main characters when viewing the relationship. Additionally, the show barely ever touches on the \"we're two girls, therefore it's wrong\" trope that squeezes any sense of fun out of any plot line.\\n\\n\r\n- Diversity in Relationships\\n\r\nWhen you get down to it, Sakura Trick is about young girls falling in love. But dig a bit deeper, and you get to see three separate types of relationships blossoming. It was very nice to see a variety of different relationship standards being shown, instead of one simple relationship focus.\\n\\n\r\n- Bright, Happy Art\\n\r\nA show that centred around young blossoming love should have stylistic choices that match that setting. Sakura Trick absolutely knocks that out of the park with bright pastel colours, fun visuals representing characters, bubbly background cutouts, and many beautiful lighting choices.\\n\\n\r\n---------\\n\r\nNegatives\\n\r\n---------\\n\r\n- Cast Screen Time\\n\r\nThe main characters of the show are Haruka and Yuu, for good reason. I have no complaints about their screentime, especially in regards to their relationship. Where a small qualm lies is with how the show distributed the screen time of all the other characters. Yuu's sister got far too much time in the spotlight compared to her friends, and this is especially true with regards to Kotone and Hiromi. The latter's episodes/segments often felt rushed, while the former's dragged on over multiple episodes. Additionally, a number of side characters are introduced quickly at the beginning and forgotten until they are needed later, at which point they're suddenly thrust upon the viewer with short time to get to know them. I would have liked to see a more even distribution of character development, focusing less on Mitsuki and more on other supporting cast members\\n\\n\r\n- Episode Pacing\\n\r\nI am very aware of the reality that much of Sakura Trick's manga was in a 4koma style, and as such leads the anime to have to adapt many small scenes into one episode. I still often got a bit of whiplash from the context switches, and I wish those were handled a bit better. This anime did such a good job reading between the lines and filling in the gaps for the manga. If only they could have gone a little bit farther to better adapt it to the medium they were using.\\n\\n\r\n- Ending\\n\r\nI was left somewhat disappointed with the ending of the show. I cannot say much because I do not wish to spoil much, but there were a few key moments I wish had been a little less... awkward than they ended up being. Ultimately, I was left satisfied, but only partially. I would've like a more definitive, flashy kind of ending. \\n\\n\r\n----------\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\n----------\\n\r\nSakura Trick is the type of show that fills a void that anyone who enjoys romance is too familiar with. It allows us to finally let our hearts be free and enjoy watching a relationship actually bloom, with satisfying payoffs and many cute lesbian kisses. The characters feel somewhat realistic, but still fun in an anime kind of way. The relationships portrayed feel more authentic, and have more weight to them because they show actual affectionate displays.\\n\\n\r\nIt pushes past many romantic tropes, eschewing the all-too-familiar sexuality double standard and delivers genuine, caring affection like I haven't seen in any other anime so far.  At the same time, it sidesteps many pitfalls that other romance or lesbian focused shows fall into. And do not make any mistake, it is also quite a funny show too!\\n\\n\r\nIf affectionate displays like kissing (and I mean real kissing, not cute pecks) make you uncomfortable, then this isn't the show for you. But if you're open to the idea of real sexuality on display (without dipping into anything too risque, of course) then this show will do everything it can to fill that void in your heart that so many other anime have left. It will reward your patience, and make sure you leave each episode feeling happier than when you left.\\n\\n\r\n------------\\n\r\nFinal Rating\\n\r\n------------\\n\r\nWhile it makes for nice averages and wonderful sorting, when it comes to reviews I personally do not like direct numbering systems. Instead, I am to answer the question: \"Would you recommend I watch this show?\". So,\\n\\n\r\nIf you are a fan of romance, I would definitely recommend giving this anime a try. The first episode should give you a good idea of how the rest of it will progress.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are new to/interested in the above genre(s), it might not be the very best series to start with, but I would still recommend you give it a shot. Best results will come if you walk into this anime looking to satisfy an entertainment craving in your heart!",

            "content": "For the most part, I really liked this show. I loved the main romance as well as the side romance between Shizuku and Kotone, and thought that both romances were incredibly cute. The only place this show failed imo is by adding in some out of place ecchi moments as well as basically the entire character arc of Mitsuki. As someone who really likes monogamous relationships in stories and gets really annoyed by infidelity, a lot of the things that Mitsuki did made me angry, but this ultimately was patched up by the end. On the whole though, I really liked this anime and wouldrecommend it for anyone who wants a nice romance story.",

            "content": "An adaptation of a 4-koma manga revolving around the sweet and innocent relationship between two high school girls? Sign me the hell up!\r\nStory - 7/10\r\nSakura Trick\u2019s main plot revolves around our central couple Haruka and Yuu. Best friends since middle school they have always been closer than usual. During a fit of jealousy Haruka ask Yuu if they can do something which other friends won\u2019t think of doing. What would that be? Why a kiss on the mouth of course! This bold move sparks a fire between the two of them leading to at least a single kiss per episode. The reason why I personallyenjoyed the simple plot of Sakura Trick, is exactly because of the simplicity. A large problem which I have with the romance genre, is the convoluted mess the romance usually becomes. This occurs when the writer tries to blend drama into the story. Luckily Sakura Trick has hardly any drama within the anime. A thought that might occur when reading the previous sentence is: \u201c Then how does the author manage to keep you watching?\u201d By focusing on the innocence of young love. Seeing Haruka and Yuu realize that their feelings - and kisses - might hold a deeper meaning than simply extremely intimate friendship is what made the show charming to watch. Other than the romance, Sakura Trick is primarily a SOL series. I personally enjoyed the interactions between all of the different characters and their conversations and managed to make this callous person smile.\\n\\n\r\n Art - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nAn aspect of Sakura Trick which really annoyed me was the fanservice. Fanservice doesn\u2019t bother me as much as it did in the past, however in the case of Sakura Trick I was appalled so much so that I nearly stopped watching the series. Most of the character have been enhanced in \u201ccertain areas\u201d and the amount of times the camera focused on those places were unforgivable. The problem with the fanservice in Sakura Trick is, that it simply doesn\u2019t work with the central themes of the series. Oversexualizing characters in a show mainly about the sweetness of young love, just absolutely destroys the atmosphere. Other than that, the art style is fairly basic. Nothing looks horrible, but nothing looks amazing either.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSakura Trick has what I like to call a stupidly-fun soundtrack. Everything from the background music to the opening and ending are all super fun to listen to. The vocalists must have had a blast when recording the opening, because it is filled with joy. It has a cheerful and happy tone and makes the anime all the more fun to watch. I really enjoyed the voice acting for Sakura Trick, because of they made the characters sound sweeter than they already are. Even though Sakura Trick\u2019s soundtrack isn\u2019t a masterpiece by a longshot, it remains to be an absolute joy to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nHaruka is our jealous protagonist who just wants to love her adorable Yuu-chan. If the world were to end and she and Yuu are the only people alive, she could die happy and content. Yuu is the sensible person in their relationship and tries thinking ahead whenever Haruka wants to pucker up. Even though she might appear cold towards Haruka\u2019s advances, she really does care for her beloved deeply. Shizuka and Kotone are the pair with the more complicated relationship as their personalities are the polar opposites of one another. This made for some great dialogue between the two and their friends. Next we have the strict-but-sweet Student Council President Mitsuki. Out of all the characters she was my favorite as she was constantly questioning her feelings for her sisters friend Haruka. Seeing Mitsuki act like a tsundere to the oblivious Haruka, were some of my favorite scenes throughout the anime. Lastly we  have Yuzu and Kaede, the pair who are constantly trying to calm their friends.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the simplicity and innocence of the relationship between the two characters and the dialogue between them and their friends. The soundtrack was super fun to listen towards. The fun characters, themes and soundtrack are what made me love the series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nIf I were to compare the romance to another anime, Karakai Jozu no Takagi-san is a fitting match as both series revolve around the concept of young love. Sakura Trick is cute little slice of life revolving around the relationship between two girls. If you are looking for a deeply philosophical anime, then Sakura Trick definitely not the right anime. However, if you are willing to overlook the pointless fanservice, Sakura Trick is an anime which makes you relax and feel content with life.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for taking the time to read my review!",

            "content": "The Positive Side: The first thirty seconds of the opening theme tell you precisely what kind of show this is.  This is a show about cute girls being hilariously and adorably gay.  Boobs will bounce.  Tongues will wrestle.  Fingers will intertwine.  And if you\u2019re the kind of person who likes cute, fluffy Yuri shows, you won\u2019t be disappointed.\r\nThere\u2019s a nice balance of romance and comedy that keeps the show from getting too sappy or too wacky and obnoxious.  One of my favorite scenes comes in the first episode, where the main characters, Haruka and Yuu kiss for the firsttime.  The lighting gets appropriately pastel and sparkly, and both characters start giving sweet internal monologues.  They keep kissing, and the monologues keep rolling, both getting more and more aroused until they hold the kiss so long, that they forget to stop and take a breath, and they both pass out.  It\u2019s over-the-top and wacky, but in a very sweet, goofy and endearing way that makes it clear that the two really care about each other, and that they\u2019re also very inexperienced.  It\u2019s a gag that not only takes the edge off the cheesy sentimentality of the scene, but also neatly captures the nature of Haruka and Yuu\u2019s relationship.  Neither of them actually knows what a romantic relationship is supposed to be like, and they hit plenty of stumbling blocks along the way, but the show ends every episode on a nice make-out session that reaffirms their feelings for each other.\\n\r\nWhile the characters certainly aren\u2019t the deepest I\u2019ve ever encountered, Haruka and Yuu have a nice dynamic.  Yuu\u2019s childish whimsy and frequent pettiness have a way playing off Haruka\u2019s possessiveness and overly sentimental nature, frequently driving Haruka to feel jealous or otherwise distraught.  At the same time, Yuu has moments of vulnerability and caring that keep the relationship from becoming too one-sided.\\n\r\nA lot of screen-time is devoted to Haruka, Yuu and their friends screwing around and being cute, but there are much appreciated moments of tension.  In addition to the general relationship turmoil between Haruka and Yuu, there is also Yuu\u2019s older sister Mitsuki, who frequently serves as the series\u2019 antagonist, insisting on protecting Yuu from Haruka\u2019s advances.  While the Hyper-Protective Family Member trope has been done to death in romance, Sakura Trick plays with the clich\u00e9 by having Mitsuki develop\u2014and furiously deny\u2014feelings for Haruka.  Mitsuki gradually morphs from being an authority figure attempting to stand between Haruka and Yuu to a love rival to her own sister, but she remains a source of tension whether she is lurking around spying on Haruka and Yuu, or preparing her confession.\\n\r\nWhile there\u2019s plenty of fan-service, it never really gets in the way of emotional development, and feels like the natural result of the characters feelings for each other rather than something forced in.  Haruka and Yuu make-out a lot, and Yuu comments on Haruka\u2019s big boobs more than once, but that\u2019s what girlfriends do.  It only makes sense.\\n\r\nI particularly loved a bit of fan-service delivered in an after-episode bonus.  A secondary character is taking a bath, and the camera is making the expected zoom-ins on her body, when abruptly, she looks over her shoulder into the camera, smirks, and says, \u201cFan-service Scene\u201d.  At first this seems like she\u2019s just randomly breaking the forth wall for giggles, but there\u2019s a deeper meaning to her awareness.  This isn\u2019t the typical voyeuristic camera-angles that Harem series so often employ.  There\u2019s an aspect of consent here that a lot of fan-service misses; the girl knows  full well that the audience is checking her out, and she\u2019s perfectly fine with that!  So many Ecchi series rely on accidental groping, walking in on distraught girls naked and ogling camera-work, it\u2019s refreshing to see an affirmation of consent accompanying an erotic moment.  I wish more shows had this kind of awareness.\\n\\n\r\nThe Negative Side: There\u2019s a part of me that\u2019s tempted to give this series a 10 out of 10 purely by virtue of being the first romantic comedy I\u2019ve reviewed that doesn\u2019t have any rape or vengeance fantasies in it. Speaking seriously though, I\u2019m not about to pretend that Sakura Trick is some kind of mind-shattering literary master-piece.\\n\r\nThe relationship between Haruka and Yuu is sweet, but it isn\u2019t incredibly deep or complex, a fact the show acknowledges in the final episode.  While Mitsuki does wrestle a bit with her feelings for Haruka, this isn\u2019t the kind of Yuri that\u2019s going to show us a lengthy, emotionally-tortured journey from self-loathing to acceptance and happiness\u2026 and that\u2019s perfectly okay.  Not every Yuri needs to deal with bigotry and homophobia, and not every show ever produced needs to deliver a thoughtful commentary on some massive, societal issue.  Sometimes, you just want to watch a show about cute girls making out, and Sakura Trick is that show.\\n",

            "content": "Since I only really watch romance/drama animes, I tend to rate the score for being either heartwarming or making me teary along with a good story and great characters.\r\nAt first, I was skeptical since I've never watched a same-sex romance anime before and I'm grateful I made the choice to watch this anime. Although I may not watch Yaoi since I'm a hetro man and it would wierd me out, I'm definately sold on  the Yuri category. It was my first watching a Yuri anime and I was very impressed.\r\nStory (10) : It is no surprise of what most people came to watch sincein the description it mentioned that the two main characters would share a kiss as a special memory, I'm sure many of you hopped on then to see what would happen because i sure did. The first episode plays out with everything you see from the description, and it is beautiful to say the least. After that episode is entirely up to whether you want to watch too, although I will say that every episode that follows is a tremendous experience that gives you the \"heartwarming\" feeling.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (10): All characters in this anime are unique to say the least but connected in a way. Of the group there are six friends, each one has a great past or somewhat story to tell about another one of the friends. For example, Haruka and Yuu are friends from their previous school. Kaede and Yuzu were also from their own school. And finally Kotone and Shizuku aren't from the same school but Kotone lives in Shizuku's residence. So they each have someone they know in the friend group. And even though these all seem similar being friends of two before in the group, their attitudes and back-stories are completely unique. Although I cannot tell you about their back-stories since It would be spoiling the experience, I can tell you about their attitudes about each other. For example, Haruka is super-jealous of anyone getting closer to Yuu rather than her. So her attitude against Yuu is completely heart-warming like seeing two affectionate puppies, although her attitude to the others aren't even close since her jealousy can be a problem. As for Kaede and Yuzu, they are more normal than any of the characters like most friends are supposed to be, although one of them loves to prank a lot. And finally Kotone is the ultimate tease, always teasing Shizuku in the most delightful way.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10): The art style used in this anime is among one of the great art-styles. It is smooth and delightful to look at. It depicts the structures, environment and characters in such a lovely way; seems appropriate due to the story of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nSound & Music (10): Normally I would disregard any introduction music or ending music and skip to the actual anime due to a lot of animes having a wierd taste of music. But the music and sounds used in this anime is really delightful and makes you want to listen to it more.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10): Last but not least how much I enjoyed the anime. Well I definitely give that a perfect score due to it being a solid \"no-regret\" anime. I enjoyed this anime thoroughly. It fills you with great comedy along with the romantic side of the anime. It is truly amazing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: This is an anime deserving the 10/10 score. If you want an anime to watch, this is a perfect selection.",

            "content": "When it comes to Yuri I try to avoid them because of the possible chance that it could cross the line between Ecchi and P**n, and I do not watch anime for that reason.\r\nSakura Trick was the first Yuri that I went into fully aware of it being a yuri, because of what I had seen around the internet and heard from other people. I was greeted with something that I believe could almost be a kid show in my opinion. Homosexuality is a very touchy subject and not everyone agree's with it in one way or another. But Sakura Trick did something with itthat made it seem like it could be watched by basically anyone (Without Homophobia,of course). Yes, the show has two girls just starting High school kissing each other... a lot and not with reason you might expect from a yuri anime. The anime itself when watching it seemed to not take it self very seriously and it had a certain ease to it without going overboard. The art style is different, in a good way it goes out of it's way to make sure you know who the main character's are and who's important. The music could be better and not very remember-able in my opinion. Character design is nothing short of typical student character's that are represented with human flaw's and quirks. Overall I truly believe if your looking for something a bit different from the average normal slice of life/school related anime give this one a try because it has a great story with a bit of twist all being around one particular thing.\\n",

            "content": "Sakura Trick: The reason we need more Yuri. \r\nSakura trick is a fan-service Yuri-light anime that focuses on the developing relationship between two girls, Haruka and Yu. Over the course of the series, the girls make the decision to make their relationship special and apart from that of their new friends by sealing it with a kiss. \r\nThis of course, leads to petting, lots of kissing, and some suspicion from Yu's older sister as to the nature of their relationship.\r\nStory.\r\nThe good and bad thing about this show is that there is only very light story over-reach. This means each episode has the girls dealing withan outside factor in a lesbian relationship without any lesbian role-models. The downside is that some episodes feel really flat, and very one-shot in theme and design. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the Yuri feels only slightly exist, and the story makes you feel generally happy for the two girls, there are parts of the anime that fall short, because no other relationships are really explored very thoroughly.  \\n\\n\r\nThe story basically sums up as: \"Girls who are lesbians kiss a lot. Also have Lesbian pals.\"\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is a mixed bag. The character designs are pretty basic. A couple supports break away from the mold, as does Haruka, being taller and less glamorous than is typical, but I've seen about 20 Yu carbon copies in my limited anime experience. \\n\\n\r\nWorse, there are times when the animation gets still frame, and all you do is slide up the sketch of the girls knee -> thigh -> skirt -> boobs, as if this were an anime dating game. \\n\\n\r\nThe fan service is non-stop, and was overall a detraction. \\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was fine, the songs okay, the VA was decent, the main problem is too much dialogue devolved into high pitched \"anime girl whines\", that sounded more like a horde of cats singing than a girl being embarrassed. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\\n\r\nThis is where I was disappointed. Haruka was a good character. She had insecurities, jealousy, and a number of okay points, but the rest of the crew  were just flat. You knew about 20 seconds of exposition dialogue about each, and that was it. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nOkay. So like I said earlier, this is why we need more Yuri. Whether it's a dedicated series, yuri characters, or whatever, the fact that there is so little of it is why Sakura Trick gets gobbled up and seen by Yurifans. \\n\\n\r\nIt's a weak offering, but without many competitors, it's used as a \"Yuri Classic\" example. If ST had stronger characters, real conflict, and a more engaging story that tried to talk about the struggles of young lesbians without models to base their relationships on, it would have been amazing. Instead, we get a fan-service fest that goes out of it's way to lock two young girls in rooms alone as possible so they can suck face and be bashful it. \\n\\n\r\nIt's things like ST that keep the genre from being taken seriously. Anyone who decides to dip into the Yuri world and sees this is going to assume all yuri-ai is nothing but moe-fests with whimpering teenagers who are drawn as pedo-bait protagonists with mush for brains. \\n\\n\r\n**semi spoiler**\\n\\n\r\nThe worst part was at the end, when it's all said and done, and a scene happens where the characters who have talked about how they are special to each other all series long suddenly come to the epiphany that they have no idea what love is and they'd rather not talk about it, because they are special friends, not girlfriends. \\n\\n\r\nReally? \\n\\n\r\nOverall.\\n\\n\r\nI grudgingly give a 6. There were enough moments to make me smile, but end the end, all I could think was \"This.. this could have been so much more.\"\\n\\n\r\nPros and Cons\\n\\n\r\n+ Real Yuri. The girls are in a relationship from the start.\\n\r\n+ Good use of color and visual technique, when not in dating sim mode.\\n\r\n+ Cute, if standard, character designs.\\n\r\n+ If you want moe moe moe, this is your show. \\n\r\n+ If you need fan service every 30 seconds, your in luck.\\n\\n\r\n- Real Yuri Action, No Yuri feels. The longer the show goes, the less it feels like two girls in love and the more if feels like bi-curious besties who are young with no sense.\\n\\n\r\n- The fanservice is more intrusive than I like. I don't care about screens full of uniform boobs, it's what the minds and hearts behind those boobs are doing that I desire to experience. \\n\\n\r\n- No real depth to anything. Whats offered on the surface is what you expect everywhere. \\n\\n\r\n- Watches at times like a dating sim. 10 second screen freeze and slides of girls giggling and doing nothing else.",

The art and sound i will give 10 for it. There is no annoying voice actor making super weird sounds or very cringy sound imo. However , enjoyment i will give only 8. This is because the last episode is just so weird and cringy that i cringe so badly that i minus 1 mark from 10 and another point is that they end it without giving me what i want to see , ( ayuri pair haven't develop). For character development , there is no much development in it just that the couple gets closer and we were able to witness more kissing scenes which is really great fan service. So i will give 9 for it. There isn't much yuri animes out there that really seems to be interesting and cute as sakura trick. While watching sakura trick , almost every episode i realized i ended up with a \"kyaa~~~\" fan-girl scream xd This just tells how much i like about this anime xp\\n\r\nif you have doubts ......................................\\n\\n\\n\r\n~~~~ GO WATCH IT RIGHT NOW ~~~~~~",

            "content": "First of all, this show isn't for everyone. You can tell by the spread out scores people gave it. I write this review only having watched 3 episodes, because I don't intent watching any more of it. I wouldn't called the show bad, but I just don't like it.\r\nWhen I read the synopsis, I expected a (romantic) story. Oh boy was I deceived.\r\n\"The story revolves around Haruka and Yuu, two girls who go to a high school that is slated to be shut down in three years. To share something special between them, they share a kiss, and their relationship deepens from that moment onward.\"\r\n(spoilersfrom episode one are present)\\n\r\nThe first sentence is correct, but that's not the part that caught my attention/interest. It's the second sentence that's deceiving. The sentence doesn't connect to the previous except for having the same people in it. But the main offender is that there's no context. It doesn't tell you they share something special because Haruka is possessive and jealous of other girls hanging around her friend. It was to declare their FRIENDSHIP.\\n\r\nThen it says they share a kiss. This isn't wrong, it's actually quite correct. However it doesn't tell you why they kiss. They could have shared a diary, a cat, a bag, a secret (well it turns out this is a secret, but whatever), or any other kind of experience. But they didn't, because a kiss apperently was the best option. And that's quite fine, you know, if you're attracted to your friend and you want to deepen your friendship, I could imagine you would kiss her (I'm not against shoujo-ai so why not?). However this kiss didn't have any romantic significance. It was just a kiss because the FRIENDS couldn't find anything better.\\n\r\nThe last part of the second sentence states that their relationship deepens from that moment on. Strange as it may be, it made me assume they were going to bond more due to the kiss. I mean it's in the same sentence right? Well since I only got to episode 3, I can't tell you their relationship didn't deepen. It also doesn't say how much/fast it deepens so they got me there!\\n\\n\r\nNow as for the story after 3 episodes there's pretty much no progress. Which isn't a problem if it's something Like Yuru Yuri, because Yuru Yuri doesn't advertise a story and is supposed to be FUNNY and delivers. In Sakura Trick however their relationship deepens from friends who kissed once, to friends who kiss more frequent. I mean it's probably only been a month or 2 so why move faster right?\\n\\n\r\nArt: OK, huge boobs, why? I don't know. Girls are animated really girly sometimes, I don't know if any girls would actually \"run\" like that. And atleast Haruka has knock-knee. But I can live with that.\\n\\n\r\nSound? Can't remember. It wasn't memorable in either a good or bad way.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.... Ok so the characters are unique and there's 6 of them. And that's pretty much how far the good part of this section goes. Since I can't really say too much about the 4 supporting characters except that they weren't horrible that leaves me to the rest. Yuu's sister was also not horrible. By the way they're NOT in an all girls school, there are boys walking around. They just don't actively take a part in this anime in the first 3 episodes. And apperently 4 out of the 6 girls rather kiss females than even talk about boys. Actually the amount of focus a boy gets in Non Non Biyori is even higher (he doesn't get lines, but atleast he get's acknowledgement of being there.\\n\r\nSo Yuu and Haruka... Yuu at first reminded me of Hotaru from Non Non Biyori, whom I like. But the thing is Hotaru is 10-11 and has genuine feelings for her \"crush\". Haruka just wants to kiss. Hotaru is acting more like something her age than Haruka is. Which leaves us a childish or underdeveloped Haruka. Yuu to me feels like the standard male harem MC. Little to no redeeming qualities, bad at studying good at sports.\\n\\n\r\nThen I want to disect this anime a bit. It has:\\n\r\n1 Lesbianism\\n\r\n2 Kissing\\n\r\n3 Hiding the kissing as a secret\\n\r\n4 Comedy\\n\r\n5 Drama (I know I haven't mentioned it thus far, but it's there.)\\n\\n\r\nIf you would take 1 away, the series would fall apart. If you take 2 away or reduce the frequency, the series would fall apart. If you would take 4 away the series would still stand (I never really liked the comedy all that much). \"We got to jump! Drag me along with you as you jump!\" *shorter girl grabs taller girl's breasts instead of her waist*.\\n\r\nThe drama I've seen wasn't bad, but it would be nicer if kissing wasn't the answer to everything.\\n\\n\r\nSo did I enjoy it? Not really. Is it bad? Well actually I would say yes. Does it mean you'll think it's bad? Not necessarily. If you like to see girls kissing no matter how frequent this is the show for you!\\n\\n\r\nOh final note: some people say it's a hidden gem. It's controversial, it's showing yuri or shoujo-ai still has a lot of potential. I agree, there's room for more shoujo-ai, more and better especially better.",

            "content": "Yuri lover (and people who actually use the word shoujo ai) must watch this. Is a must watch and is in every yuri bible book. This is the holy grail of yuri. A show that has the first episode with two girls kissing. Yep, that's right, no final episode for that final kiss is there from the get go. This is Sakura Trick\r\nSo story wise, it can be sum up by the op, two girls kissing. Yeah at first glance there not much to this. It just follows two friends who start kissing each other and are perfect for each other. Their biggest problem isthat they are both air heads who are embarrassed by their love to each other. Is honestly quite cute and adorable and just fill my heart with way too much sugar that I can't believe my heart did not explode from watching this show twice. That being said there much more subverting going on here. For one the two girls kissing each other in the first episode instead of having it build up. Second is the fact that they are both airheads, which is something new and makes for a lot of good comedy.  The third is that the show seems to have lots of couple in this story in different phases. With one starting to date, the other already dating, one character discovering her sexuality and an other two friend potentially blooming. In many ways, the girl discovering her sexuality is your typical yuri main character being somewhat the side character which was neat. That being said only the two main lead and her sister get the main focus which is a disappointment as it would have been great to see more from the other characters stories. While I do like the main couple Haruka and Yuu (my favorite couple in fiction), they could have had one less episode dedicated to them. That being said episode 8 was truly heartwarming. \\n\\n\r\nAlso to note the romance and the comedy is done great, but yeah there could have been more done with the message. The fact that the main focus is two person being embarrassed by their feeling might put off people who don't want just fluff. Which while I don't blame those people, the chemistry is just so strong and the drama with the sister is very interesting.\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound: The animation is great, is Sentai who usually do a competent job. Nothing amazing, but good enough to accommodate the jokes and help the heartwarming moment. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Yuu and Haruka are amazing. My favorite couple ever. Never seen two airheads dating each other that much and this just work wonderful with Yuu being the childish brat idiot, while Haruka is the overjealous idiot. Is surprisingly work. Granted if you don't like their character you are somewhat out of luck as aside from Yuu sister, the other character have way less screen time. That not to say the other characters don't get screen time, but they could have definitely had more screen time. They are still a bunch of fun and add to the comedy and serve somewhat a reflection on Yuu and Haruka relationship, but I wish they could have been focus more. I mean Kotone and Shizuka relationship is your typical rich girl and best friend scenario with all the cliche minus the tsundere surprisingly enough. That being said they definitely had more substance and drama in their relationship that could have been worth looking into more. That being said they are still great when they are on screen just like the rest. When my biggest complaint with characters is I get to see less from other characters while still loving the main lead that get too much screen time, you must be doing something right. \\n\\n\r\nSo overall this messy reviewer will said that Sakura Trick is definitely a must watch Yuri (shoujo ai whatever) anime. \\n",

This show completely goes all out with no intent of looking back at what will go down in history of what Yuri Yuri almost was.\r\nStory: 2/10\r\nLook; there is no story. Every episode just helps each character get closer to the one they love. This anime focuses on a group of high school girls that are starting to form affection for another female. This topic is pretty iffy with some people (not me) and in other anime the line has never really been fully crossed in terms of what happens affection (physical affection) wise. Sakura Tricksays fu$# that, these bit%$es be horny as a motherf#@%er, time to get down. My jaw almost hit the floor in the beginning episode as I witnessed the main couple really get into their feelings. In other Yuri shows there is a hint of restraint and blackout scenes are used when needed. In Sakura Trick no such thing exists since when the time comes, you see all the affection. I was quite flabbergasted that they went into such detail on some of the scenes (again it didn't bother me I was just literally awestricken).\\n\\n\r\nBut plot wise it is just a slice of life so it moves quite slow. You see the same gags in each episode so you might get a little bored with the same cycle over and over and over again.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nNot too bad actually. The character models look pretty good and there seemed to be a pretty smooth frame rate throughout the entire show. The use of light colors really matched the carefree feeling of the show.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nAverage performance, average soundtrack, subpar opening and ending songs.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nAgain pretty average by my standards. There are some somewhat touching scenes later on but I never really felt totally invested. The characters worked well with each other and helped form some funny scenes here and there but it wasn't really a knock-it-out-of-the-park performance.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThis show is just really average. If you are into Yuri stuff then you will love this show. However if you are looking for substance, comedy, or character development be ready to be pretty disappointed. It is though very very very kawaii.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review! If you liked my writing style, would like to see some other reviews, or just want to talk, please stop by my page!\\n\\n\r\nSincerely,\\n\r\nAwesome Drummer",

            "content": "Sakura Trick was an anime that was burned into my memory for how distinctly terrible I thought it was. Nothing could ever emulate the pain and disdain I felt watching it for the first time. My hatred is so storng that I'd even consider this to be my least favorite anime of all time. Yet, the other day I felt compelled to rewatch this anime. Whether it be out of masochism, wanting to look at this show objectively, or a mix of both, I decided that it was a good idea. I wasn't toosure what I was looking for, but I can say, after rewatching, that it isn't as bad as I first made it out to be. However, the animosity I feel towards it still burns deeply.\\n\\n\r\n        Sakura Trick follows our main couple Haruka Takayama and Yuu Sonda who have just entered highschool together. Feeling like their friendship is weakening, they decide to share a kiss together in order to create a special bond between them. This is essentially the only romantic development Haruka and Yuu get. Sakura Trick only gives a vague reason why they might like each other and they roll with it for the entire anime. Their romance feels very shallow and doesn't really go anywhere. I'm pretty sure the only reason the romance was there was to have an excuse to have two girls kiss. Sakura Trick definitely delivers, but boy does it deliver way too much. While kissing is normal thing to do in any romantic relationship, Sakura Trick does it way much. Every episode sees our main couple kissing at least twice or more. In fact they kiss over 50 times throughout the entire show. This amount of kissing is frankly ridiculous and is just there for the sole reason of fanservice. A kiss is normally a sign of affection and love however, when its done to much it just becomes obnoxious. Every episode finds some contrived excuse to see them kiss and it got really old really quick. Its unusual how unsatisfying Sakura Trick makes kissing feel. Usually, a kiss scene is one of the most impactful or tantalizing moments in almost any romance. Sakura Tricks shows us that if you do it too much it ends up not achieving its purpose. It killed any remote form of excitement I could've had knowing that these two were gonna end up kissing just because. \\n\\n\r\n      To be fair with Sakura Trick, the entire series isn't just about two girls kissing. Most of this anime is pretty similar to your average cute girls doing cute things show. Each episode is split into two parts, with each focusing on a different event or joke. It consists of the girl's school life and some of their exploits outside of school. I would describe this part as being inoffensive. The jokes are decently funny, but nothing really stands out as particularly hilarious. They do many of things that you'd expect, like prepare for a school festival or going swimming. If you seen any cute girls doing cute thing show then you are familiar with the things this show will cover. \\n\\n\r\n       Now lets talk about the characters, starting with the main couple. Haruka is up first and I have a couple problems with her. Haruka is best described as being obsessive, jealous and extremely gay. Most of the jokes revolving around her are imagining being with Yuu, being distressed when she's not in her general area or fantasizing about other girls. She was kinda entertaining at first, but a lot of her jokes are basically the same. She never changes and quickly becomes annoying. Yuu is no better. She's stupid, dense and needy. She actively fuels Haruka's jealousy, seemingly on purpose. She often ditches Haruka and even shows preference for the other girls of the cast. She's so frustratingly dense that I wondered whether or not Yuu even liked Haruka. She quickly becomes an annoyance and isn't fun to watch at all. Their interactions with each other are also frustrating. Most of it consists of one of them whining to the other until they get what they want. I can't deny that it might of been cute to have a needy couple. However, it is so overplayed that instead of being cute it becomes annoying instead. Most of the time they are together one of them was whining so it was hard to put up with them. Their relationship is also static and doesn't go anywhere. Despite being a romance, Sakura Trick never properly develops their relationship. From start to end they feel like the exact same couple. Nothing that might change their view point of their relationship ever comes up and always was just a matter of loving one another because they loved each other. They do try to force in some development towards the end, but the end result is just admitting that they love each other(which was apparent considering how many times they kissed).  \\n\\n\r\n     While the main couple might be obnoxious and a real pain to watch, the other characters are a lot better. Sakura Trick actually does have another romance in it, between Kotone Noda and Shizuku Minami. Individually, they were entertaining. Kotone's energy definitely brought some life into the jokes and even had some funny lines. Shizuku on the other hand might not talk much, but she does have some cute scenes. Their relationship is also far better that the main one. Unlike Haruka's and Yuu's, Kotone's and Shizuku's is cute and well developed. Despite their contrasting personalities, they seemed very close and felt like they had a legitimate bond. It was pretty cute see them together and most of their interaction were pretty fun. They even get some development and face some conflicts that might change their relationship. That being said, their relationship is sadly underdeveloped. Their relationship doesn't get much time to actually flourish and its mostly a side plot. It kinda sucks because it seemed far more interesting than Haruka and Yuu's relationship.\\n\\n\r\n  Another likable character was Yuu's sister Mitsuki, who has a crush on Haruka. Despite being the student counsel president Mitsuki was often shown to be awkward and clumsy. She a lot of cute scenes where she gets flustered after thinking about her crush or just doing things that only a klutz would do. She was entertaining just because she was cute and is fortunately given a good amount of screen time. While her cuteness is a upside, a minor problems with her involves her crush for Haruka. For the most her crush for Haruka is mostly just a joke however, they do try to establish a semi-serious love triangle and it doesn't work. Mitsuki isn't given a reason why she likes Haruka, until the very end. This is a problem because this love triangle is the source of the only conflict this show has and without a reason it just fails to be a good love triangle where she has any chance. That being said the love triangle isn't a huge part of the show, so its somewhat forgivable. \\n\\n\r\n     The other characters are mostly forgettable. They don't do anything particularly interesting and exist just to tell some jokes. Their presence  neither hinders nor helps the show in any significant way. Kaede does have some funny lines but that's really about it. The rest of the cast are all side characters and get very minimal development, which is fine.   \\n\\n\r\n      One of the problems I want to expand on is Sakura Trick's fanservice, specifically its kiss scenes. I already mentioned the excessive kissing in this anime. While the amount of kiss scenes itself is already a problem, another problem I have with them is how they're presented. I'd definitely describe Sakura Trick as a cute moe show however, the kiss scenes might suggest otherwise. Plenty of kiss scenes had a lot of tonguing and moaning. It was kinda uncomfortable to watch these scenes and they felt more at home with an ecchi or even hentai series(I swear some of the lines fit right into one). This is definitely more of a personal complaint, as I don't think scenes that feel extremely sexual fit into a cutesy show such as this. The contrast was jarring and uncomfortable for me. While it also has other forms of fanservice, they more acceptable to me (like a swimsuit episode or random cuts to some of the girl's breasts). For the most part I don't mind these in cute shows as they aren't that sexual and comparatively innocent.               \\n\\n\r\n    I actually really like the art style of Sakura Trick. It has a very pleasant, cutesy style that I enjoy and most of the characters also looked really cute. The animation was also interesting. Some of the scenes were kinda structured like something you'd see from a Shaft show, with simplistic backgrounds. As I am a huge fan of Shaft it was nice to see. The music was also decent and the OP is kinda catchy.  \\n\\n\r\n    You might be reading this review and wonder why I feel such hatred to this show, especially considering that I actually like some of things this show does. My hatred stems from the first time I watched this series and how I my mindset back then. I actually wasn't all into yuri at first, in fact I had mostly avoided it. After hearing about how notoriously sexual yaoi was I just assumed for yuri. After sucking up, I decided to pick a yuri to watch and I chose Sakura Trick. After watching, it validated all my fears for the genre and I swore off it for months. So I really don't hate Sakura Trick for the content itself, but mostly for making me think poorly of a genre that I now enjoy. So is Sakura Trick the worse thing ever made? No, I've definitely watched worse. Do I still hate it? Yes I do. Do I recommend that you watch Sakura Trick? No there are far better yuri series out there(unless you really want to see two girls kiss a lot). \\n\\n\r\nThanks for Reading!\\n\\n\r\nMy Ratings:\\n\r\nStory 4/10\\n\r\nCharacter 5/10\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\r\nSound 6/10\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment 1/10 \\n\r\nOverall 4/10",

            "content": "While far from being the best anime I've ever seen-- either critically or just based on my personal tastes-- Sakura Trick surprised me. (In a good way, thankfully.) \r\nAs usual in shows that are rather heavy-handed with the Slice of Life element, I should probably start out by saying that that's not really my thing. I typically prefer shows with a little more action. But I have found some enjoyment in them in the past and like to give everything a try. And on that note, I will say I really liked this underlying theme they had of making the most of every day andappreciating what you have before it's gone-- spurred on by the atmosphere of their school's pending closure. (Although, even this, I felt, fell short in some ways. The series only covers the girls' first year, and so we don't get to see that through to the end. I really felt like some sort of official goodbye and a graduation scene was in order.) \\n\\n\r\nBut let's be honest; we all know what everyone's really here for. I found the romance to be... cute. I felt like that 'making the most of every moment' atmosphere was a good backdrop to their relationship, and it was satisfying to see them both grow over the course of the series. You can really see them going from being little kids-- just imitating adults-- to being two people capable of managing a relationship. But even on top of just making me feel all warm and fuzzy inside, this show got more serious than I expected it to. LGBT+ issues in anime have been done well in the past, (as well as done poorly its fair share of times) but I still rarely see them addressed openly. Which is why I was really optimistic about the plotline with Mitsuki. Honestly, I would have enjoyed it a lot more if she hadn't developed a crush on Haruka herself, but they really pull it together by the end. I really liked the shift near the end, where they were finally confronted and asked to define their relationship for what it is. It's not everything I wanted it to be... but they come pretty damn close, I'll give them that. \\n\\n\r\nI will say that the characters in general fell a little short for me as well. Honestly, Haruka and Yuu were a little bland. The Slice of Life element didn't really help them there, as it started to feel at times like all their mini adventures chronicling their everyday lives was just an excuse to see two girls kiss in a variety of different scenarios. (It felt a little... exploitative at those times, particularly around the middle of the anime.) It certainly didn't help that they were consistently upstaged by the relationship between two of the side characters. Shizuku and Kotone, on top of having stronger personalities, just had a more interesting story between them. A story that really highlights that 'making the most of every day' theme. \\n\\n\r\nA lot of things about this show even out. Like, the visuals are about as simple as it gets, (with the exception of a few dramatic scenes near the end, where the lighting was used really well) but their comedic timing was always really good. It's cute and lighthearted... in a way that dragged just a little for me. They start to address the real issues-- of Haruka and Yuu only having to keep it such a secret because they're both girls... but still kind of skirt around it by the end. At the end of the day, I did enjoy this show. I can't really see myself ever going back to watch the whole thing again... But I'd definitely revisit the highlights. And if you're looking for a shoujo-ai story that's generally lighthearted but does have its heartfelt, meaningful moments, I would definitely recommend this one.",

Anyways, the art-style is cute, the characters are all cute (most of them are lesbians too for some reason... going to a girls-only school sure does affect you), hell, even the music in it is super lovey-dovey, the opening's name is \"Wonchu kiss me?\" for fucks sake!. Now if we gottatalk about plot... It doesn't make much sence at times and things are kinda rushed, it get's boring at times since it's always the same thing but hey... that's how romantic animes work, right? but the comedy in it really makes you go pass that.\\n\r\nIf you don't have diabetes and you love cute romance stuff, even if you don't like yuri that much, you HAVE to check this anime out.",

It is focused on the slice of life and romance aspect of the anime. Even though I have not watched much of this style of anime, it was not bad. There is a decent story to it, revolving around the two main characters, Haruka and Yuu. These two girls share a special friendship that develops as the season progresses.\r\nYou might enjoy this if: You are looking for a story of high school friendship and you are not afraid of seeing two girls become slightly \u201cmore thanfriends\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nYou might not like it if: The summary does not spark your interest.\\n\\n\r\nNote to the Viewer: Sakura Trick is not a full-on sexual romp. It is a good story of friendship.",

            "content": "Something that has always fascinated me was yuri. People have such a passion for this genre and bring it up all the time. I wanted to know what this genre was capable of. That's why I watched Citrus. A friend recommended me this anime as a way to screw with me. It did. Awful storyline, awful characters and awful first episodes. I was exhausted after watching Citrus, but I knew that there was more to this genre and didn't give up hope. After dabbling in a few other yuri's I came across Sakura Trick, an anime that had a premise of girls kissing each other(which rarely happens in other anime). After finishing the anime, I can definitely say that they got the kissing part at least right. Does it deliver on other fronts?  \\n\\n\r\nLet's begin with what you see right away: The animation. The color pallet is very bright and soft, often having a spring vibe. Nothing too interesting or special, but still nice to look at. The animations are okay, the backgrounds are nothing noteworthy and the expressions are what you would expect of a high school anime. It is basic stuff. What is noteworthy are the symbol scenes. Sometimes between scenes there is a brief scene transition animation that shows what is happening. For example: when Yuu gets closer to Haruka a brief animation appears showing Yuu's flower symbol moving closer to Haruka's flower symbol before it cuts to the next scene. These scenes can sometimes help getting a better understanding of what is going on, other times they are just repeating things which already were obvious. It's a neat thing nonetheless.  \\n\\n\r\nGreat, I was able talk a 140+ words paragraph on how the animation is just average. The same thing goes for the OST. The opening and ending songs are nice to listen to, but aren't noteworthy beyond that. I can't remember much about the other songs in the anime, except the one that plays during in the emotional scenes. That song is cute and surprisingly emotional.  \\n\\n\r\nNow we get to what I consider the most important aspects of an anime: The story and the characters. The story begins with Haruka and Yuu on the first day of high school. They are really close friends and love each other dearly, but now they only got 3 years before they go to different colleges, so they both set out to get the most out of their time together. So that's when they decide as a way to cherish this period in their lives to have a kiss. A very passionate kiss at that. Then a few days later they kiss again. Then another few days later they kiss again. And again. And again. And again. Their friendship turns into a full-fledged lesbian relationship. Now it is their job to keep this relationship alive and keep it a secret from others. The story is pretty original for an anime, but is inherently nothing that special and is just kind of dull.  \\n\\n\r\nThe character cast consists of 7 characters. The two you are going to see the most of are Haruka and Yuu. Haruka is the raging lesbian. Every time she sees Yuu do anything or sees two girls do something gay she gets extremely... happy (to put it lightly). Yuu is the child. She looks like a child and acts like one, but she never struck me as annoying, which are I am very grateful for.  \\n\\n\r\nThen there are five other side characters. Shizuku is the quiet one. She doesn't speak up a lot and is kinda shoehorned into the cast. She is in a relationship with Kotone, the big sister (personality wise). She is very responsible and teases Shizuku a lot. I enjoyed their relationship and how it played out, but there was not enough time devoted to them which makes me question why have time devoted to them at all, except for that they then have another lesbian couple and so they can tease the viewers with the third ''lesbian'' couple, Kaede and Yuzu. These two characters have basically the same personality (the friendly bro's). Their only difference are their characters designs and I have to admit I like Yuzu's design with the cute cat ears. The last character is the actual big sister of Yuu, Mitsuki, the closet loser. She very dependable on the outside, but in reality she is very nervous and gets quickly jealous.  \\n\\n\r\nIs it complaining time? It is complaining time.  \\n\\n\r\nIn the first episode Haruka and Yuu meet the rest of cast and decide that they are friends. So now they all are friends because they say they are. Character development? Missed the train. The character development takes longer than usual and it makes the first few episodes frustrating to watch. That is disregarding the fact that first half even without the late character development generally worse is than the second: Less story, less conflict, less excitement. So if you are not immediately invested in the premise from get go your first impressions will not be good.  \\n\\n\r\nAnother problem I have is that the humor is crap. The anime only got a few chuckles out of me *in its 12 episode series*. The humor boils down to characters making puns and the music stopping like you are stopping a record player to follow up with a lame punch line. It is hard to express my distaste, but you have to see this for yourself if you what to get a better understanding of what I mean.\\n\\n\r\nSo with these two big problems and some other smaller problems (like character similarities and average aesthetics), you have an anime that is nothing special and doesn't succeed in its most crucial moments. Does the anime have any redeeming qualities? Yes it has: The kiss scenes. These scenes play out as simple as the title: The characters just kiss. Even with that, I can't help but really like these scenes. They have tons and tons of passion and are generally really well animated. The buildup is also really good too and it feels you genuinely deserve to watch these scenes after what they went through.  \\n\\n\r\nSakura Trick was an interesting watch. It is mediocre to the core with a boring first half, slightly above average character cast and bad humor, but the kiss scenes are just nice enough for me to enjoy it. I encourage you all to check it out if you just want to have an anime where girls kiss. If you want to have an anime with great characters and fantastic humor, then go watch Nichijou or something.",

            "content": "(updated 9/20/18 for format and slight content revision)\r\nHi! Welcome to another installment of Robert's Too Late Reviews! If you're looking for plot details, check the synopsis for the skinny on all that. Sometimes, though, reading what a show is about doesn't give you a good feel for how the anime works out, what your expectations should be, and whether the general concept is compatible with your tastes, right? Well that's where your friendly neighborhood...reviewers come in! Will this make the lost RTLR wall? Let's talk about the good, the bad, and the kissy faced found in Sakura Trick!\r\nI'm a big fan of romance anime, Iconsider Kimi no Na wa to be one of the best movies I've seen, and I'm a big fan of yuri anime, which inexorably lead me here. If you look on just about any major list of 'top yuri anime' you're going to find Sakura Trick on the list somewhere. While it is two girls crushing on each other, but make no mistake, its not romantic in the same sense as Aoi Hana, nor is it is straight up hardcore yuri like Strawberry Panic. It is a bit more than the class-s yuri such as Maria-sama ga Miteru. Basically your mileage on this series depends on your stance on kissing and young girls making out. If repeated kissing scenes does not float your boat, head out to open water and pass this one up, as that's the central focus. We're getting quickly to kissing, and never moving past that. So straight up, this is an one trick pony. That's not to say it's not fun, a show doesn't have to be shocking at every turn to be 'good'. Sometimes knowing what's coming doesn't keep you from enjoying how the story gets there. This is the case with Sakura Trick.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nAs I said, we have a comfortable groove in this anime, with starry eyed Haruka just plain crushing on her schoolmate, the more reserved Yuu. It does not take long at all for our two girls to begin the smooching, and the rest of the series revolves around the circumstances of these make out sessions. Basically we see a pattern of hijinks, make out sessions, almost getting caught kissing, and back around to hijinks to set up the next round. The joy comes in how they get into the situations they find themselves in, how they are nearly caught and by whom, and how they confirm they really are crushing on each other and are both wanting their relationship to be romantic in the sense that applies to their level of maturity. \\n\\n\r\nAgain, this series is *not* Strawberry Panic with heavy sexual overtones (and more) but it's not a tender moving story based on character exploration such as Aoi Hana. This is purely fluff in the sense that not even the show takes itself too seriously. The setting is pretty much standard slice of life fare, festivals, school activities, homework, etc. This can be comforting because we don't have to wrap ourselves around any errant details, and we can watch at a much more relaxed manner than we'd have to take for something like, say, Fate/Stay Night for example. Each full episode is split into two parts, so instead of a single 24 minute runtime, we get two 12-14 bites which makes the plot a good deal better paced. Even the anime itself realizes that a full show would be too much to stretch the thin plots over. If you're familiar, this is very similar to the structure of Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt. \\n\\n\r\nThis is a silly show without the need to take notes or keep up with complicated plots. The series limits itself mainly to the main couple of Haruka and Yuu, even though another couple exists but is not really explored, I think due to a desire to stay focused. The humor is provided by a pair of friends that are fairly clueless about what is going on between Haruka and Yuu, and are generally just funny, even occasionally breaking the fourth wall. The main antagonist is more a concept than a person, being usually the risk of getting caught kissing and having their secret uncovered. Yuu's big sister gets into the fray at one point, with disapproving views on the relationship she's suspicious about. Her motivations for disapproval aren't a big surprise, but they fit with the flow of the series, and make sense in that respect. Of course the big sister involvement leads to more hijinks and therefore more excuses for spit swapping, but hey, like I said, that's what you're signing up for here. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nThe girls are all expressive, and varied enough to carry their personality forward. They aren't copycat depictions with slightly different haircuts, as some anime use. The different effects played are fun and interesting, the backgrounds are all nicely done and flow with the rest of the artwork very well. Nothing to complain about here.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nI have to ding the score here a little bit as the two girls can get to moaning during kissing to the point we're pushing near porn grounds. Its at a level I wouldn't watch without headphones or being alone, as they are at times embarrassing to people who have, you know, actually kissed someone before. Otherwise the sound is fine. I find the opening and closing songs both to be absolutely a ton of fun, and I've been known to randomly break into song with \"Love! Won't you kiiss? Kiss and love!\" Yeah, my family all look at me funny! If not for the over the top moaning, I'd really have no knocks against the sound.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nIf you're with me for the kissing ride, then you will likely fall in love with the characters themselves. Haruka is so openly crushing on Yuu its so cute. She is stereotypical in the fact that she has eyes only for Yuu and even quickly becomes jealous if Yuu has anything to do with the other friends. This jealousy is really well related to the feelings I had when I was her age with my first few girlfriends, before I learned how to act like a mature person in a relationship, so her feelings are authentic from where I'm sitting. Yuu tries so hard to make it seem as though she's almost not interested in Haruka in a romantic way, but she's quickly changed after a few kisses, and even though she continues to act standoffish most of the time, she burns for the kisses as bad as Haruka does. They are complimented by four other friends, two that are the couple I mentioned in the story section, and the final two friends are the comedic foils, and are hilarious in the way they puzzle over many of the things that happen in the show. Yuu's big sister is pretty funny, and even looks a great deal like Yuu, leading to some more hijinks type moments. \\n\\n\r\nThese are a bunch of silly girls doing silly girl things, obsessing over things girls obsess over, and generally acting like you would expect silly girls to do. And guys, we were silly (in a *manly* way of course) at that age too, just girls are more fun to watch. The characters are great, even if they are fairly one-note types. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nI clearly enjoyed this show, I admit that it was refreshing for me to think of young love, or well, in this case young crushes where things were as simple as finding a quiet spot to share a quick kiss or two. By limiting the story to just this level without slathering on all the sexual stuff there is a level of (strangely) innocence presented. Even being a grown man I can think back on my first kisses with a girl and the feelings I had then, and this anime does a good job of bringing those memories back to life. \\n\\n\r\nYes it is predictable, it does repeat the same few basic plot points over and over again, but sometimes just taking it easy and blushing as the girls kiss and you remember those early awkward days of stepping freshly into love can still be a great experience. I wouldn't call this a yuri 'romance' but it is a fun little anime about crushes and kisses, and gets my vote of approval! They scored one pic on the RTLR wall, of Haruka and Yuu holding hands. Only question is, won't you kiss?",

It's a lively show, the main heroines are Haruka Takayama and Sonoda Yuu who's currently a classmate and be a damn-too-good friend since Junior HS. Basically we can't ignore the present of other heroines that look really like main characters too, Shizuku Minami, Kotone Noda, Kaede Ikeno, and Yuzu Iizuka. While Yuu and Haruka (main heroines) are so lovey-dovey with each other, almost neglecting other presents, the others are steamed-up and funny. The fusion of slice-of-life, school life, yuri, and comedygenres in Sakura Trick (  \u2022\u0cb2\u2022) \\n\\n\r\n    If you expect that majority of slice-of-life and school life anime stays between the line of average for graphics, well I do so. But it's different with Sakura Trick, from my sight, Sakura Trick stands in the minority of the thoughts, where the visuals really please your eyes. I appreciate the details, colours, and movements here. The colours are soft but placed appropriately, like the rise of shadows, dark colours to bring cloudy aura. For the details and movements are not superb but it is above average for daily life anime genre. I can feel the atmospheres slowly change one into another noticeably by the pleasant scenes through the story.\\n\\n\r\n    Since first, the story indeed shows how madly in love Haruka and Yuu is, the first two episodes really set our eyes on their relationship as certainly yuri couple. However, as the time goes, the story reveals gracefully other characters too, how their involvement makes the story to keep moving forward amusingly. At any rate we can find occasionally the story standstill, by standstill I mean, it's only showing us the funny parts of the show before continuing to detailed the characters. Sometimes it goes in the right time but sometimes not.\\n\\n\r\n    OP \"Won(*3*)Chu KissMe!\" by SAKURA*TRICK is a typical energetic song, the pump pump beat and cute voice of the seiyuus. It is really describe the desire of main heroine who loves to chu her beloved partner. My favorite parts are the ending themes. ED \"Kiss(and)Love\" by SAKURA*TRICK (Haruka Takayama's seiyuu & Yuu Sonoda's seiyuu) is heartwarming while ED for ep 8m \"Sakura Sweet Kiss (\u685cSweet Kiss)\" by SAKURA*TRICK (seiyuus of Mitsuki Sonoda, Sumi Otokawa, & Rina Sakai)\u266a is my favorite!\\n\\n\\n\r\n\u200bYuri level is quite high even without ecchi scenes *be careful* (tho' I like it)",

I actually enjoyed the complicated relations between the girls and their relatives, their integration in society, coming out as homosexuals and the importance of gay acceptance.\r\nActually who am I kidding. It's literally about girls kissing each other. Even the intro is about kissing and dancing, but mainly kissing. Also the general content of the entire anime consists of kissing and kissing is hands down the strongest selling point of the show. Yeah...\r\nI mean yuri is a very \"difficult\" genre. Difficult as in what exactly is the showgonna be about. Probably girls, right. But what are the girls doing? Well, we can either make them kiss or we can straight up make a slice of life and put a yuri label on it, let it be about female friendship and be done with it (aka Yuru Yuri etc.). Sakura Trick is more of the former than the latter. So yeah, kissing. I'd like to tell you there's more to it, but there really isn't. \\n\r\nIn the end it's still a slice of life, so it's pretty chill, you don't have to think about the show while watching it, after watching it and you actually don't have to think about the show at all. That being said, it's all about the visuals, sir. Don't expect a real story besides girls being friends (with benefits). \\n\r\nOh and kissing. Did I mention the kissing part? That's pretty important. 10/10 (actually a 6/10 is more appropriate). The visuals though.",

I'm really critical at that point and I want to mention that the development of a characters relationship is not really a story with many plots or actually any good.\r\nAlthough the characters are well designed with their own personalty traits.\r\nSomething that really annoyed me was that the sub that I was watching hat the spellingmisstake of \"won't\" instead of \"wont\", wich seemed really unprofessional. Though, that doesn't is fault of the Anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnd just something: why are these kids so mean? I mean they left all windows compleatly open when these leaf things fly in. Don't they think about the cleaning staff how has to clean up that mess?",

            "content": "*Sub Anime Review*\r\n--Story--\r\nSakura Trick is a very light hearted yuri anime about two teen girls-Yu and Haruka- who want to stay friends throughout school, so they decide to kiss, something other girls wouldn't do. And they kiss again, and again.. I really enjoyed the plot, it was pretty different from other Yuri I've seen. One thing that made this anime stand out was that it tackled some actual relationship issues that happen with gay couples, such as not being able to show too much affection in public and people disapproving. Although it represented real-world issues, it was very light hearted and sweet. Definitely recommend fora weekend watch.\\n\\n\r\n--Art--\\n\r\nThe art was amazing, it perfectly fit the light hearted tone of Sakura Trick. It was beautiful. \\n\\n\r\n--Sound--\\n\r\nThe voice actors fit their characters very well. I especially loved Yu's voice, it fit her pouty self. The opening song and ending songs were pretty good, but they did contain a lot of fanservice, which isn't really my thing (..at least not in this anime).\\n\\n\r\n--Character (Protagonist)--\\n\r\n~Takayama Haruka~\\n\r\nHaruka was adorable. Although she gets frustrated easily and is a bit insecure, she tries to treat Yu and her friends well.\\n\\n\r\n~Sonoda Yu~\\n\r\nYu is bossy, childish, stubborn and pouty, which matched her appearance. Although she is childish, she holds more common sense than Haruka.\\n\\n\r\n--Character (Antagonist)--\\n\r\n==Does not apply to this series==\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime, and I'm considering reading the manga. This is definitely up there with my favourite Yuri anime, such as Yuru Yuri. \\n\\n\r\nI'd recommend this to..\\n\r\n-People who like short and pleasant anime\\n\r\n-People new to Yuri\\n\r\n-People who liked Yuru Yuri and Yuyushiki \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I'm a big fan of yuri, so this show came out of the gates promising to be a personal favorite.  As many of the reviews point out, there are multiple scenes with girl kissing per episode starting in episode 1.  I'm very easy to please when it comes to yuri, so these scenes never got old to me.  However, the story and characters would constantly get in the way of the experience, especially in the later episodes.\r\nEarly on in the show, the main characters, Haruka and Yuu, already have a great friendship and decide to make their friendship even more special bykissing each other.  While the reasoning for this is pretty weak, who cares because yuri.  For the first 7 to 8 episodes, these kisses seem to become more meaningful for both of the characters and they seem to be moving towards an honest, open relationship.  However, around this point the show makes a huge misstep in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nYuu is generally more reluctant to kiss than Haruka, although there are exceptions to that at times.  This shyness is usually cute and by the 7th or 8th episode, she is more active in initiating kisses and the relationship becomes better as a result of that.  But for some stupid reason, the show decides to have Yuu's older sister enter into the picture and try to interrupt the relationship.  This arc was so damn frustrating, the point of it from a plot perspective was to force Yuu into realizing how much Haruka means to her, but as a viewer it felt shallow and frustrating.\\n\\n\r\nYuu's sister plays off her actions as a noble deed because Haruka and Yuu don't know what their doing, but this holds little weight for me considering that she's trying to steal her sisters girlfriend.  This character, quite frankly, was the worst.  It was also aggravating watching Haruka consider someone other than Yuu, especially when that someone is Yuu's sister.  Overall, this entire situation seemed to exist entirely to push the relationship between Haruka and Yuu past a superficial level.  However, it was handled in such a lazy way that I actually felt like their relationship got worse.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this show has some good moments and features a lot of yuri, so that alone made it a worthwhile watch.  The issues with the story and annoying characters ended up detracting from the experience enough that what should've been an easy 8 or 9 for me ended up closer to a 6.",

It's a beautiful anime that I found so adorable that every time they kissed, it just warmed my heart. I could watch this when I'm sad and I would instantly cheer up. \r\nSakura Trick tells the story of two high school girls Haruka and Yuu, who are starting high school. They realizes that when they graduate the school is being torn down so they want to make a memory to makethem remember the experience. They decide to share a kiss because no girls would do that. There relationship deepens from there and secretly start dating. They soon find out there friends are lesbians as well, but don't tell anyone. Yuu's sister becomes suspicious of their behavior and tries to put a stop to it.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime isn't perfect. It has some flaws, especially the ending, no spoilers but they did some bullcrap before the actual ending so when the ending came, it wasn't satisfying. Also the fact that Yuu's sister thinks that girls dating girls is wrong, even though she wants to date Haruka, which makes no sense. It's sad that they won't make a season two but through the 12 episodes that this anime had, it was a fun ride.",

            "content": "First off, read the most liked review. You'll be missing out if you don't. Onward then to my review.\r\nWho would think to actually encounter a 1/10 show? Think about, how bad does something have to be, to have it rated the lowest you can? After watching this show I can tell without a doubt; this is the bottom of the pit. \r\nYou look around in the threatening darkness of this unknown chasm you fell into. Weak sunlight pierces this abyss, you see the frames of motionless bodies laying around you. These rotting corpses you knew from before. You tried forget, sure, but they etched themselvesin the back of your mind. Unending recycling of tropes, merciless sexualization, deprived of all story and meaning. You know the list of such shows.\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, at one point the majority of the popular anime shows reach into this same old trick hat too. But there's a difference between what you can consider 'borrowing ideas' and between not having a single unique, defining element in your show. If I had to summarise my problem with this show I think I would say:\\n\\n\r\n\"The problem with Sakura Trick is that it believes without second guessing that it came up with lesbians\"\\n\\n\r\nIt is legitimately a 'trick'. It's a trick on you. To make you believe it will attempt to turn this around. It will become a good show eventually. Keep watching. It will change. You want to believe it. It's the family alcoholic in this unending downward spiral. But you already know how that ends. Not the way you wanted it to.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is a combination of these tropes that are like caffeine and nicotine. Refreshing in small doses, lethal in large ones. You will inject yourself with a deadly amount of Moe and Yuri tropes by watching this show. You will not survive. It's raw. It's concentrated. It's like you order a coke and they bring you the syrup it was made of instead. You want romance? Here's direct, non-stop, sexually overheated physical relationship between your protagonists and characters.\\n\\n\r\nSakura Trick is the definition of the 'now, kiss' meme. This is how far you can take sexual innuendo in anime without becoming hentai. But interestingly enough, it's not at the ecchi level either. It's this thing, that's just awkward sufficiently enough so that you keep looking behind your shoulder when you are watching it, even though it's not particularly explicit visually. It's that feeling of guilt that you get watching it. Do I like this? What's wrong with me? Why am I watching this? It leaves you in an existential crisis after an episode.\\n\\n\r\nSakura Trick is like locking yourself in a cage with two male, underfed Bengal tigers, who had been exposed to female tiger hormones for weeks and then throwing away the keys. It's like shutting off the water main and then lighting your flat on fire while your entire family is sleeping in it.\\n\\n\r\nSakura Trick is oblivion. Watching this show will shatter your soul. If you respect yourself or merely don't want to damage your mental health, avoid this.",
