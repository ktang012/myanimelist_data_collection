            "content": "[Spoiler Warning]\r\nComing into Attack on Titan season 3 I was slightly nervous because I heard that this season was going to be more focused on Human vs Human, but by the second episode all my doubts had been relieved and thought It was the greatest shit ever.\r\nVisuals and Animation - 10+\r\nOut of nowhere Studio Wit upped the quality of the production values to a point I didn\u2019t was possible in a TV anime. The Levi vs Kenny Squad sequence in episode 2  had some of the best Sakuga and animation I had ever seen All of anime, let alone TV anime. The amount ofshit going on in that scene literally just made my brain go like, \u201cwhat the fuck that just happened.\u201d Not only did the animation improve but also the art quality improved. In some scenes I was just in awe of how Wit Studio crafted the world of attack on titan so beautifully. \\n\r\nThe only thing I had a slight issue with was some of the CGI cuts. The rod titan was done pretty well but some CGI cuts were not pretty. I Also liked how they designed the crystal basement, thought it looked nice.\\n\\n\r\nSound & Music -10+\\n\r\nHiroyuki Sawano, the man, the myth, the legend. This dude has composed almost  everyone of my favorite soundtracks and is always consistent. Some uneducated people might say all his work is too similar, but guess what? Who tf cares if it is similar all his music amazing and on top of that Attack on titan has in my opinion the best soundtrack in anime EVER. PERIOD. Everyone song in attack on titan sets the mood and tone perfectly and can strike a range of emotions, whether it be sad,inspiring,hype,heartwarming,scary, or nervous every emotions can be felt. Also the last scene when they played the scouts theme and Erwin was getting the scouts and the people hype was fucking heart pounding and gave me goosebumps.\\n\r\nNot only is the soundtrack good but the voice acting and sound effects are excellent as well. Dub and Sub both do a great job.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 9\\n\r\nEren- had some pretty good development learning that he is not special and developed some chemistry with historia and became overall more mature, only issue I had was he sometimes got a little over dramatic and the stretch of episodes where he wanted to be eaten and was called constantly crying got a little old. Though even did come up clutch with that crystallization power and was badass when he through the barrels in rod titans mouth\\n\\n\r\nLevi- We get some much needed depth on Levi\u2019s backstory and see how his mom died and was a prostitute, how he lived with Kenny and when Kenny died how he really showed sadness that his father figure died. Also we get to see how fucking badass he is taking out every mf in his path. He went off against Kenny Squad twice and even injured Kenny. But that chase sequence was something else and just shows us how super human Levi is. Also the scene at the end where he is threatening to break Erwin\u2019s legs so he can\u2019t go on the mission shows how much he cares for Erwin and doesn\u2019t want to see his friend dead, but at the same time when Erwin reveals that he values going on the mission to retake Wall Maria more than humanities victory Levi has to respect Erwin\u2019s dream and let him continue. Also we see how Levi has to mentor the new Levi squad - Connie, Eren, Mikasa, Jean, Sasha, and Armin, to kill other humans and hardens them as shown when the new recruits see that there faces have changed. \\n\\n\r\nHistoria - she gets a lot of development in this season, first we see her backstory how her mom was rod reiss\u2019 mistress and didn\u2019t care for her in the slightest. We also see her develop a relationship with Freda, who she remembers when rod shows her the erased memories through his magic bloodline power. Historia for the first half of the season is manipulated by rod who wants her to become a titan so he can get off on his God fantasy. Historia who is blinded by the memory of Freda blindly follows and at the last second changes her mind and breaks the syringe and flips Rod. This a huge development because historia is finally taking control of her own destiny and doing what she feels is right. When historia was made queen I thought it was going to be weird but AOT pulled it off and Historia gets her huge payoff when she cuts ties with Rod completely by cutting the last piece of him, thus ending his life and breaking historia completely free of her past. Also Historia gets closer with eren and Mikasa catches wind of this in episode eleven when she gives Eren the Death Stare.\\n\\n\r\nErwin - Uh oh, the Erwin death flags are high after episode twelve, with Levi showing concern for his safety on the mission to retake Wall Maria. Moving on, Erwin starts of this arc being arrested for murder he didn\u2019t commit and having dramatic conversations with pixus and Nile.\\n\r\nHe then comes up with a badass plan to fake a titan invasion and turns the table on the aristocratics running the government, who panic and want to quarantine Wall rose. This doesn\u2019t sit well with pixus or Nile so they overthrow the government and head for eren. We also see Erwin\u2019s backstory and how his father was killed because he found out too much about the world and that drives Erwin to uncover the truth of the titans and the world. Finally, Erwin gets the send off he deserves rallying the crowd and the soldiers. \\n\\n\r\nMikasa- she doesn\u2019t really get that much focus into her character but does have some pretty cool fight scenes but we do see her mood improve when eren goes back to his normal scrappy self when he fights jean.\\n\\n\r\nArmin- in ep 2 armin gets his first human kill and gets emotional about it, he starts to show maturity and is more useful to the scouts also he cross dresses and gets felt up which was weird, reminds Eren about dream to go she the sea\\n\\n\r\nJean, Connie, and Sasha - we get see just how More mature they become when in the first battle vs Kenny squad they are indecisive and nervous and then in the second fight they just straight up murder people from the Kenny squad. When I saw my boy Jean slice that dudes neck and Connie also kill someone I was like \u201cfuck they really out here killing people.\u201d Also that scene when they are hype for the send off was pretty funny\\n\\n\r\nKenny - personality was super unique and he was a really cool character his fights with Levi were pretty hype and the whole gunman style of him in his squad was really dope. His death was pretty sad and the story of how he came to live with Levi was well done only issue I have with him is he died before his character was completely fleshed out.\\n\\n\r\nPlot - 9.5 \\n\r\nFinally the PLOT! I appreciated the change in direction and commitment to focusing on character development rather than Titans. Although I did think the bloodline power thing was sorta whack the story was overall good. All though I am pissed that series is taking a break because I was hype to see them retake Wall Maria but whatever.",

            "content": "Other than the male x male shipping, I am not finding many reasons to like this show anymore.\r\nHalf of the season is practically a collection of cliche action scenes. People teleport from the sky to save the day, others swing in the sky with spider-man gears, evil people sit on the face of someone just to prove that they indeed evil, Levi declares he is an insane badass by committing an act that distantly resembles the twisting of an arm. So fucked up! I am scared, literally how can man be this insane. Please, no, not the arm. \r\nThe other half is practically a parodyof politics except the narrative itself doesn't recognize this lameness as a parody. People with might and power declare a thing, but another thing happens -- much like with the teleporting nakama in the action side -- other big guys teleport whenever important decisions are supposed to be made. Essentially every part of the politics is so one-dimensional it hurts and serves as an excuse to create more bullshit to fill the story with. These vary from random kidnapping incidents to people thinking one of their nakama dies if they don't hurry up. I am not sure how exactly am I supposed to be fooled by this when it is clear plot-armors in the series are thicker than the walls itself.\\n\\n\r\nThe best part of this show are the supposedly evil people and \"our\" enemies. Whenever our main squad gets called subhumen or pseudo-soldiers by them, I agree whole-heartedly. The opposing party did nothing wrong when looking down on our plebeian children at arms. Which this show really is all about. Some kids acting like they matter, fighting against titans or being titans or hiding from titans behind walls made of titans. At least the first season was fun to watch because it was a complete disaster and so overboard idiotic. This isn't even ironically fun anymore. More meaningless events one after another.\\n\\n\r\nThis season doesn't achieve anything. It's just Eren being chained half the time + farming, characters pondering over some action for half an episode each episode just to see the thing itself never happening. It's all false tension, all words no reward, no payout. Boring substance that is repetition of the same over and over while the fallacy that something might actually happen being there to fool those who are still buying this. Oh no, titan appears for the 700th millionth time, what a shock, I wonder which one of the two things that ever happen when a titan appear, happens this time around. Literally can't wait for the next cour.",

            "content": "In a desolate world where corruption, power, and control rules all, Attack on Titan feels like a story that goes far deeper than just survival. As someone who has been following the series for several years, this franchise has really made a reputation. I\u2019m not even talking about the commercial sales revenue or fan base. I\u2019m talking about how this show evolved from a war between Humans and Titans.\r\nAfter only a year, Attack on Titan made its grand return. Given the popularity of the franchise, this was inevitable but the big surprise was how soon it got announced. The first season ran for 2-cour in2013 while the second season ran for only a single cour in Spring 2017. Yet, here we are with a third season after just one year. As a fan myself, I\u2019m more than pleased to say that the third season continues to live up to its household name. It\u2019s a franchise that truly deserves its acclaim.\\n\\n\r\nWatching the third season will make fans quickly realize the change of mood in the very beginning. In fact, this season may not be what you are used to and will take some time to adapt with. The lack of Titans is evident from the first few episodes. Attack on Titan has been praised in the past before for its great action. Not only does the production quality and rhythm enhance the experience, the show itself always managed to capture the momentum of every battle. Here we are in third season and it takes a step back with the fighting between Titans and humanity. Rather, we have humanity dealing with its own problems - internal issues and political conflicts along with deep secrets that runs in the veins of key characters.\\n\\n\r\nFor a long time, we\u2019ve seen the political conflicts inside the walls and government. Coming into the third season had me wondering how much we take a dive into exploring that side. And to my pleasant surprise, this season made a clear point that Titans are not the only enemies in their world. In fact, humans are also part of the problem and our main characters have to find a way to deal with it. For instance, Levi\u2019s Squad faces off against adversaries that challenges them to life-and-death scenarios. Levi also faces a dangerous individual from his past, a man named Kenny. You may have heard him screaming in the promotional video but that scream isn\u2019t just a battle cry. It\u2019s the realization that he has to deal with his own personal demon. It\u2019s not just him either but the realization of actually having to kill humans will test the mental limits of our characters. \\n\\n\r\nAs in all of the Attack on Titan seasons so far, we take a look at background storytelling for some of the important characters. From this season, we take a look at Historia, Kenny, Keith, and even a bit of Eren\u2019s mother, Carla. The key selling point is how these characters' stories connect with the overall plot. It\u2019s imperative that viewers understand them as these stories reveal characters\u2019 motivations and how their actions influences the present. To me, I think Attack on Titan always managed to capture a viewers\u2019 attention through its characterization. The creator wants the audience to understand these characters by both telling and showing. It\u2019s accomplished with important dialogues and actions motivated by a clear set of goals. I can\u2019t really talk exactly the precise details as it would be spoilers but the big picture to realize here is why these characters are created. Attack on Titan Season 3 also made me understand why characters are motivated to do certain things and is an accomplishment not to be overlooked. The amount of psychology and emotions makes the story impactful too even for newer characters like Kenny. In terms of plot elements, the show continues to heighten the mystery. Attack on Titan has been known to create a feeling of suspense and there\u2019s no doubt this season will surprise you.\\n\\n\r\nIn the present, main protagonist Eren finds himself in more trouble than just a death sentence. I would say this season made him feel less relevant at first until you realize what\u2019s at stake. Eren\u2019s connection to the past is one of the key mysteries in the show that probably had fans formulate theories all the way back in 2013. Here we are 5 years later and some of that mystery has answers. In the meantime, characters such as Erwin and Pyxis also play important roles with consequences. The plot evolves to become much more complicated than just a war against Titans. It becomes an internal war of complex ideologies. There\u2019s also many revelations that shows how certain characters have connections with each other. And to add on to the cherry on top, we do still get fighting segments for you action junkies.\\n\\n\r\nSeason 3 takes a different approach this time but retains its ability to tell a memorable story. It managed to hook me in the beginning once realizing how important character roles are. Through its characterization, it showed me that the show doesn\u2019t need fancy action and cinematics to make a well-polished anime. Sure, that part isn\u2019t entirely absent but is limited compared to the previous seasons. Whether that\u2019s an appeal will be for you to judge. Just do realize that Attack on Titan doesn\u2019t always need people drawing out their blades and sticking it into Titans\u2019 necks.",

            "content": "*Minimum Spoiler Review*\r\nTL;DR: If every weird conspiracy theory you had for SnK suddenly started becoming true... Well that's this season of SnK for you. From Titans dying like Titanic to Internal Gov'ts crashing like US Stock exchange on day two, this first cour of SnK will leave you screaming... KENNEEYYYYYYY! \r\nIf you didn't watch S1 & S2, don't even bother reading or watching this anime.  \r\n[Story: 7/10 , Characters: 8/10, Art: 9/10, Sound: 8/10, Enjoyment: 8/10]\r\n\"You Levi. You grown any yet\" - Kenny Ackerman\r\nThis season of Shingeki no Kyojin or Attack on Titan should really be called Attack on Internal Government. From military coupsto Historia becoming a waifu boo and Eren slapping himself to stop being Eren, this season definitely stands out from all the previous seasons... good or bad? Let's find out. What originally was supposed to be a 2-cour anime by Wit Studio, they throw another curveball towards fans by making it 1-cour due to budget & work constraints. That's alright since the anime delivers through their concise story adaptation, developed secondary characters, great non-hype music and as always stellar art & animation style. However, after finishing watching it, it will always leave you feeling empty as this season was less substance but more action, overall.  \\n\\n\r\n\"Who decides... Who will you trust?\" Erwin Smith\\n\\n\r\nFrom the story stand point, director Araki & Koizuka did a phenomenal job taking some of the most boring drawn out manga arcs and presenting them in a different order to retell the author's story. Though S3 seems like it starts out of nowhere as no continuation is felt from previous season, you are immediately thrown into the internal world of life inside the wall with high paced action of people fighting people using ODMG but instead of swords vs swords we now have swords vs GUNS. Great job hooking puzzled viewers in and over the course of this anime we get to learn the real truth behind how politics is actually governed inside the wall. From who's pulling the strings, history of royal blood and finally the truth behind the man Eren's father really was. The best takeaway would be wondering, who really is the hero or rather who is actually doing what's morally right as shown through juxtaposing the childish views characters once had of this world vs adult views now they have chosen to accept. Who really thinks for the people and who are just selfish power hungry trash. The manga arc was boring but the director paced the story well for viewers to bite through it as well as some flashback stories of two key characters in this anime really solidifies Erwin's purpose of proving his father's hypothesis. \\n\\n\r\n\"The person that I killed... I bet they were a nice person. Someone that was much more human than I am...\" - Armin Arlert\\n\\n\r\nThe main reason this anime gets praise this season is because we learn a lot of the history behind characters who we were somewhat curious about. This anime is no longer about Eren but more about the people inside the wall vs the beings outside the wall. From focusing on Historia's growth to Levi's tragic past and shedding light on the Ackerman Family & Reiss Family line, we get a sense of how the chess pieces are moving or have been moving all throughout history for mankind to come to this sort of standpoint. The anime also explores the change in psyche soldiers like Armin, Sasha, & Jean go through as they now have to cope with killing humans not just titans, a huge taboo. The beatdown lecture Levi tells them about we kill those who will harm us as self-defence & to protect our close ones parallels with IRL military soldiers and how they are trained to kill \"units\" not people. Because if you humanize your enemy, you will have hesitation vs treating them like \"beasts\". That's one interesting take-way from this season. Also huge shoutout to characters like Kenny & Hange, keeping the anime fresh with their torture techniques. Not to mention, the seiyuus for this season who were able to tell the story more through the anguish in their voice. Huge kudos to them. \\n\\n\r\n\"I never said who was right or wrong. I don't even know myself.\" - Levi \\n\\n\r\nAside from the somewhat linear story arc & developed secondary characters, time after time, if there is one thing this studio does justice, it's their animation & art style. This season they nailed it as well. Every panel was hand-drawn really well. The action sequences flowed really well. We harp the studio for taking forever releasing the anime but atleast they never flake on us on quality. The background score was really hype throughout all the fight sequences and the drops right before key enigmatic moments definitely escalates the excitement each episode. What stood out most though, was the opening of the anime. We are so accustomed to hype opening songs such as Feuerroter Pfeil and Bogen & Die Fl\u00fcgel der Freiheit by REVO of Linked Horizon that when a slow melodious anti-hype casual song as Red Swan by X Japan came to be opening song fans were lost and confused. This wasn't the SnK they knew and came to love. However, it grows with time and you get why that opening song was used instead of hype songs as this season wasn't about humans vs titans but more humans vs humans. This was what the directors wanted to drive home and by using opening song as this he set the battlefield for just that. So great foresight from their part. \\n\\n\r\n\"Go on and torture me already. That's all I did with this blood-stained hands of mine\" - Djel Sannes\\n\\n\r\nOverall, SnK S3 wasn't that bad of an anime. Is it as hype & story packed as previous seasons? Not really but given the manga arc the directors were working with, they did a pretty good job. By following not the path the mangaka, Isayama,  had originally planned out to this new pacing, it served justice to the anime viewers. Though the studio will take a break after 1-cour and continue part 2 from Spring (hopefully) it will be worth it to not read ahead and spoil ourselves in my opinion. Attack on Titan has come to terms to know what their recipe for success is and that's minimizing Eren's wailing and maximizing Erwin's madness. Without spoiling too much, the series ends with their purpose tied back to the beginning. Definitely looking forward to the next season or second part as that will be real jaw-dropping moment for most fans out there who has yet to spoil themselves. Nevertheless, there is no point not watching this season of AoT. You've already invested in the first and second season, might as well binge watch this season. That's always the best way to watch this anime. The anime is building up to their denouement so why hop off the train now. Anyways, check it out & let me know later how you like it as well as share with me your favourite quote from the anime! Ciao.\\n\\n\r\nP.S. Thank you for reading.

            "content": "After a little bit more than a year of wait fan favorite Attack on Titan is back with it's 3rd season and as always we are eager to see what's in store for us this time.\r\nStory 10/10\r\nIt continunes few days after where we left off last season and it focuses more on political drama and dilemmas inside the walls. This season gets straight to the point and introduces new villain named Kenny that turns out to be somehow related to Levi. There are many parties trying to get Eren and Historia. For what reason? It is yet to be reveald. Mystery we all feel inlove with is still there and there are even more questions, but don't let that distract you from the fact that this season ,even tho is only few episodes in, already has some major reveals in it. Pacing is amazing and i wasn't bored for a moment while watching. Things are only getting more interesting when Erwin reveals how he's planning to ovethrow the governmant without using the force. This season has a very refreshing and different plot compared to previous ones as we can see from the lack of titans and focuse on the issues inside the walls rather than beyond. However it's still as, if not more interesting than before. There is world buidling,mystery,back stabbing and some major questions answered which there is hopfully more to come.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nAnimation 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAs we can see characters in this season look a little bit different or older which some might not like but i do personally. It's a fresh change. They look closer to their manga designes. Some might notice that they removed those thick black lines around characters faces which made AOT art stand out even more. Don't get me wrong, it still does but that was something that was missing which kept me from giving it 10/10.\\n\r\nAnimation is brilliant for this season (it's Attack on Titan after all :D) and like every season it only got better. It's almost flawless 6 episodes in. That levi ODM action sequence is some of the best animation i have seen in anime. Perfect combination between 3D background and 2D animation along with masterfull camera movement made this scene look like a movie. It was incredible! While i was watching levi maneuvering trough the city i felt like i was the part of the scene. Levi grappling on the bar and pulling himself towards it made me feel like i was pulled with him. There is even one frame where levi is facing the wall and you can see his reflection in the window. Just goes to show how much detail and time was put in to this scene. After i done some research i found out that it took the animator of this scene 1 whole month to complete it. Just that one scene alone. All props to Arifumi Imai. Great job. Hopfully it keeps this quality because this season is said to be 24 episodes long.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10 \\n\\n\r\nI mean, is there anything to say? AoT is notorious for it's amazing OST and sound quality. Voice actors are great as always and the sound that stand out to me the most was the sound of falling shell from kenny on the roof in ep.1. It was just so satisfying :D. And again mad props to Hiroyuki Sawano (the composer) for the epic and emotional music.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10/10\\n\\n\r\nWhat i like about AoT characters is the fact that they interact so naturally and nothing from their conversation seems forced which is immediately showcased in the very first scene in ep. 1. That cabin scene where jean and eren argue,sasha tries to steal bread, mikasa still does work even tho she's injured and armin cares for her deeply. And of course Levi the clean freak comes in at the end :p They are such fun and lively characters.\\n\r\nThis season already had some major development for our cast. We got to see Erwin's and Hisotira's backstories which also delved deeper in their characters motives. Both backstories were heartbreaking and made me care a lot more for them. Hisotira is slowly taking of her \"Christa Lenz\" facade (is that how you say it? lol) and Erwin is proving again and again why everyone loves him and would follow him to death. His childhood story is very similar to how our society and governmant wokrs today which is very scary. And we all need to remember that isayama is criticizing this type of government and society with these topics. Instead of just walking of Erwin comes back to Dimo Rivees's wife and comforts her saying he'll avange him. Erwin is charismatic,great leader, intellignet and someone that you just want to follow. Since the young age he was corious and as he call himself a \"gambler\". He is someone that would give everything for the humanity. Or is he? I think there is a lot more to his character. Hange got some development too. The way she gathered the information about nick's murder is amazing. After all she is one of the most intelligent characters in this show. She is someone that does what she promises, and she did. She tortured the guy that tortured her friend but after that she shows her other side. She shows human compassion. She repeats how she's starting to feel sorry for them and kicks the table which showcases her frustation and that she actually doesn't like what she has to do. Yeah i know it's hard to believe :D she was always crazy lol. Her weird love for titans makes her character all more interesting and multidimensional. Eren is maturing and seems a lot more chill this season but unfortunately he is kiddnaped again :( Poor guy he just can't catch a break. In ep.1 he helps historia to overcome here pain and shows again just how honest he is by telling her \"I like you more this way, just a stupidly normal honest girl\". Also hugeee development for armin. To think that he would be capable of killing a human.. this will deffinitely have a huge impact on his character in the future. The way he selfreflects and his philosohpical speach about morals is great, it really makes you think. He kinda has a point too. He shows one more time how mentally strong he is even tho he lacks physicial strength. This time is just on another level. Now lets talk about our new villain. KENYYYYYYYYYYY. I love this guy lol. The way he roasts and insults levi and the cowboy vibe he gives. I love it. He immediately showcases that he is not a joke by blowing nifa's head off just like that. He also seems very mysterious. The way he treats levi is almost as if he looks down upon him. Speaking of Levi here is what i think: That chase scene where he's running away from kenny is not just a great action sequence it also represents Levi running from his past. Kenny=His past. Running from kenny or his past. This arc is also big development and challange for him now that he has to act as a leader/commander because erwin is absent or busy. There was also some smaller developments for connie (motivating himself to take on the beast titan),jean (struggling to remain human which almost costs him life, also selfreflecting), sanes (showing how he didn't want to do the things that he has done and over the time he just got used to it, also he was kinda easy to symphatise with too and his devotion to king is may be morally wrong but aslo admirable, the way he feels destroyed after finding out that he was actually the one that betrayed the king is also worth mentioning), flegel (stepping up becoming a boss saying how he'll protect the people of his city), zachary (showcasing that he cares more about himself rather than humanity and how he always hated the governmant because they looked up on everyone).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI never enjoyed AoT more. It's great.This season has perfect balance between story telling, character development and action.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\\n\r\nIt's just getting better and better and hopfully there is more to come :) (P.S. my english is not perfect, hope you can understand :D)",

            "content": "I know what you're thinking. This will be another cliche anime. It's just about killing these weird titans. It's just another \"edgy, shock value\" show with no depth. I'm here to tell you...this show is deeper than what it seems. I discovered this anime a year ago. One boring night i decided to give it a try and I binged the first 9 episodes. But why was I so in to it?\r\nThe surprises. The complexity. The mysteries. The emotions. The music. The animation/art. The lore. The tone. The maturity. The execution. The struggles. It all caught me off guard. What ended up happening was mediscovering my favorite series in any genre, and the first anime to ever make me pick up the manga (and my oh my will the end of Season 3 &amp; 4 be amazing, and I guarantee it will shoot it up to one of the all time great animes).\\n\\n\r\nIt's rare that I discover a show that is unpredictable. It's rare that I discover a show that actually makes me feel. I see criticisms about the story only being about killing titans...that the characters are shallow...that there's no substance...and I truly have to question if we're watching the same show. There are mysteries established from the very first scene. Mysteries that are paid off WONDERFULLY later in the story. There are characters that appear to only be background characters, who end up having an ENORMOUS impact on the story. There are themes and life lessons sprinkled throughout these absurd situations. While the critics only see fighting titans, I see the character development &amp; inner conflicts that arise during these situations. All of this is accomplished without forced humor, over-exaggerated artwork, and childish antics. Isayama successfully casts aside the usual tropes, even killing important characters (which actually makes me fear for the lives of other characters). He ignores the \"friendship will win\" tropes. The \"I'm passionate to beat him\" tropes. Actually, all these situations are presented just to give you the harsh reality that life doesn't always work out that way. This is an amazing experience, and as a manga reader, I promise y'all are in for a ride. Another special shoutout to the music, which is truly an amazing part of the show. \\n\\n\r\nThis show gets a lot of haters. Understandably, like anything else, not everyone will like it. But there's plenty of people who hate on it just cause of its popularity. Or label the writer insane things because they didn't actually read the context of the story. DONT FALL FOR THEM. Be your own judge, notice every small detail of the show. If you're looking for something deep, mature, and refreshing...this show is for you.",

            "content": "I'm so happy this turned out well. Season 3 is exactly what SnK should be. \r\nI didn't think things would necessarily turn out this way, either. In my humble opinion, SnK season TWO was a mess. During the first 6 episodes, the plot, pacing, etc. was completely off and it completely killed the show for me. I wrote a long review about it before but I don't wanna spend too much time talking about SnK s2 when this is about season 3. As season 2 approached the ending, however, it seemed the writing was coming back and I began to enjoy it like I enjoyedseason 1. \\n\\n\r\nNow the writing is in full force, and everything seems to shine. Where should I begin?\\n\\n\r\nEssentially, all of our characters are set up at this point so there's no time wasted with long backstories or explanations. Whenever a backstory does come up, it's quick and does NOT subtract from the plot at all. During season 2 they kinda threw in flashbacks at random, even during critical, suspenseful moments, and it killed the immersion. If that was something you were worrying about -- you won't see that here. The story flows great. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are back and better than ever, too. During season 2 we really missed Levi in all his fighting greatness, but he really shares center stage this season. He's cool, collected, and intelligent -- even more than he was in season 1. He's back to fighting anything willing to stand in the way of his mission, and he's great at it. The show plays on the strengths and personalities of its characters and it really shows. Even though a lot of the season so far is centering around the side characters -- they don't disappoint at all. Not to mention everything is more impactful now that we've spent 2 seasons already with these people. I was looking forward to every moment their plans advanced or fell flat. Even the antagonists are cool. It's annoying to watch a show where the villains are dumb but the heroes always have everything figured out. You don't have to worry about that in SnK s3. There villains seem to be just as capable as the heroes, so you don't know what's going to happen. \\n\\n\r\nI'd say the story itself, so far, is much better than season 1 and season 2. While I enjoyed season 1 a lot, quite a few people complained about the lack of plot progression but I don't think that would be a fair complaint for season 3. During this season we've learned much more about the world, and we have a lot more factions/actors furthering their goals. The pacing is not too fast, and it's not too slow either. The story kept me on edge, with twists and turns that all flow together. I looked forward to each new episode even though the story kept me completely satisfied. What I mean by that is -- I was comfortable stopping at any episode, because I had been thoroughly entertained and I had gotten a lot with each episode. Some shows bore you with a dull episode and then a cliffhanger at the end -- not this one. \\n\\n\r\nThere isn't too much that I can say because I'm only 5 episodes in but I'm just really enjoying myself and wanted to share. Lol. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the art, it's as good as ever. I'm looking forward to seeing the animation during big battles that will come up in the future. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is good too, as it usually is. I feel like we haven't gotten too much of the OST yet so it's unfair to really judge it at this point. While I didn't care for the OP much at first, I have to admit it sounds much better using a quality headset in comparison to the bad speakers I played it on the first time. It isn't my favorite OP, but it's fine IMO. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, my ratings would go like this:\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe reason why I handed out so many 9's is because it's so early in the season so I can't be SURE of any perfection yet, but I can guarantee that I've been enjoying the HECK out of it so far. On the course it's going, I'm sure to at least keep those ratings -- or maybe I'll think it's worth something higher. Hard to say.\\n\\n\r\nRIP I had to reupload this review cause I \"didn't watch 6 episodes\"  before",

It looks like a really bad version of Christopher Vogler\u00b4s narrative structure known as \"The Hero\u00b4s Journey\". I feel that the character development is weak as well, Historia just suddenly decides to switch sides without any \"real\" reason to do so. Yea sure, she has issues when it comes to a parental figures,but how the fuck can someone be convinced to eat a person which was your former ally? The whole structure of the story feels weak, they force the characters \"tragic\" backgrounds on the audience without any chance to let us make up our own thoughts about them. I guess you could say, it\u00b4s too fleshed out. The creators leave no room for imagination imo...",

It's better than wait for four years.\r\nIn this season 3 they focus on human vs. human battles, and show a less titan scene. Those who only watch anime without reading manga, many think it's very boring to watch and they want to see the fight against the titan, for me this arc is the most amazing. \r\nThis shows creativity in the story and shows that Hajime Isayama didn't run out of ideas to make stories, and it proved to be a greatsuccess. He was not too hung up on the titan, but he showed little by little the secret behind the origin of Titan began to unfold. Shows that even inside the wall is as dangerous as outside the wall.",

            "content": "There are few anime these years that are as bloody and brutal as Attack on Titan is, yet don\u2019t use gore in an overly immature way. Although the series itself has generated much hate and criticism, I still believe it has more depth than most people give credit for. From the very first season, we get to see gruesome events of shock and horror, as well as the point of views of numerous soldiers who had to make sacrifices. It sends a message that shows humanity\u2019s determination and resilience even in hopeless situations. It shows that, even though humans have the capacity for selfishness andevil, we also have the ability to feel compassion and courage. AoT\u2019s third season is not much different.  \\n\\n\r\nPlot (7/10): From the very start of the show, we can see a change in the plot\u2019s direction. Rather than a war against the titans, it\u2019s now a fight amongst humans themselves. There are now traitors, people who desire power, and even corruption, that, along with numerous betrayals, it\u2019s hard to know who to trust. There are also major changes made to the structure of the plot. It\u2019s less about mindless violence and killing titans and more about building a relatively complex and mature story. From the backstory about Levi and his relation to Kenny to plot reveals concerning the Reiss family, this season has been an exciting watch. However, there IS a lot less action in this sequel, so your enjoyment may differ depending on what you liked about the previous seasons. If you enjoyed AOT solely for its action and didn\u2019t care much about the story line, you most likely not enjoy this season. For the rest of the fanbase, this season is a must-watch to gain further knowledge about the true details behind the walls (unless you are a manga reader ofc).\\n\\n\r\nBy this time you may be wondering, if I\u2019m praising AoT\u2019s plot so much, why did I only give this category a 7? Well, as much as I want to deny it, the show isn\u2019t completely devoid of flaws. For one, the first few episodes were painfully slow and was just mostly people talking about some political crap. The actual plot behind it was actually very interesting but I felt the producers made the dialogue too redundant. Another issue is that many scenes often felt like they were purposely dragged out, sometimes to bring out emotions and suspense, and sometimes for no reason at all. A lot of the episodes can be pretty much described in 3 sentences or less so it felt kind of boring at times. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation (8/10): I do think season 1 featured much better animation but we got to see some cool animated fight scenes this season as well. A lot of the character movements do look awkward, so I can\u2019t give this category a perfect score either. The Reiss Titan at the end was hilarious though.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10): Okay, I don\u2019t care what people say, but I absolutely love the new op. It\u2019s not intense like the others, but its got this beautiful and haunting and sort of sad melody to it. I also liked the amalee version of it a lot (I\u2019ve listened to it like, 50 times), so I\u2019m just gonna post it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCqV0wtUh1w . The voice acting is as awesome as always, though it\u2019s pretty obvious with Hiroshi on the job.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (7/10): This season focused a lot on building Historia\u2019s character as well as introducing a new character named Kenny, both of which it did a wonderful job at. Following episode 7, Historia becomes a much more believable character as she shows determination and confidence in her decisions. For someone who was known for being one of the weak and naive characters in the series, this is a nice change in her character. Kenny, a cold-hearted killer who is also (spoiler) Levi\u2019s uncle, is another important character in the series. Through him, we get more information about both his and Levi\u2019s past and the persecution of the Ackermans. Some may find him a boring and generic character at first but his characterization goes deeper than that! Due to his tough circumstances, he lived a dark past killing people and desiring power, thinking the only way to succeed is to be on top of someone. His character slowly changes for the better as he befriends Uri Reiss, and learned about compassion and forgiveness. He still to an extent, remained ruthless and cold but as the show progresses, is able to show genuine care for others. This adds to his personality, making him one of the more realistic and interesting characters of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters are basically your typical AoT cast. Levi has more screen time in this season, showcasing his indifferent attitude and badassery. Eren I was sort of disappointed with since his character felt a bit recessive in this season. I liked his personality in the first season but now he\u2019s more of an angsty teenager who is constantly whiny and complaining about who-knows-what. Erwin is as awesome as before, displaying true leadership characteristics and a very calm attitude. The rest of the cast, though, don\u2019t really matter now as they did before. They are still there but now they feel more like plot devices since they do absolutely nothing the whole time. This isn\u2019t a bad thing as the anime is now putting its focus on different characters, and it can\u2019t do that and develop the rest of the cast at the same time, but I wish that Mikasa and Armin could have had more screen time.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10): Overall, this season of Attack on Titan is pretty lit and if you are a fan you should definitely watch it. Although the execution is not always top-notch this show is still amazing and will definitely hit you in the feels and make your heart race with excitement.\\n\\n",

            "content": "The third installment to the series excluding the OVAs and it continues getting better by the second. First let me state that AoT is what got me into the anime medium in the first place which may lead to my opinion being biased a little bit, but I probably won\u2019t need to exaggerate on its quality for it already speaks for itself.\r\nSecond, this season was being criticized by many manga readers even before its release for it takes a different directive being mostly about the political situation within the walls and fights among humans themselves instead of against naked titans. This is honestly upsetting becauseof how presumptuous it is and from what I\u2019ve seen so far I can assure you that the thrill remains the same as you\u2019re used to if not better along with the intriguing action any fan of the series would be pleased with.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the titans, even if there isn\u2019t much titan action, because most of what seemed confusing in previous seasons is explained here we will have enough titans in the flashbacks all through. So, if you\u2019ve seen unjustified hate befall this anime, don\u2019t let this bum you out. Watch the PV and feast your eyes upon the action then give the first four, no, first two episodes a try and you will know what I mean.\\n\\n\r\nLastly before I start actually reviewing anything, I just want to state how glad I am to review one of my first favorite series as it airs since it means a lot to me and my career as an anime fan.\\n\\n\r\nNow to the juicy part\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nWe continue from where we left off last season. If you took my advice and watched the PV you would know this season mostly follows Levi and his squad and it starts from there. The scouts have fallen drastically and the political situation just keeps pressuring them more and more that it borderlines abusing them. And so, this season begins with how the scouts face such abuse and try to survive this cruel reality. However, this time their fight is inside the walls and their enemies are fellow human beings.\\n\\n\r\nDespite being so early in the season, so much has already happened and the pace is just what I would expect of this series. Almost certainly this season will be 24 episodes, but as of yet MAL hasn\u2019t updated it for some reason. In either case, we can expect it to have two arcs so if I find anything noteworthy in the second arc or a change of quality I will update this review.\\n\\n\r\nI have mentioned a lot of hate which this anime has received justified by drawbacks found in the manga. However, the creator of AoT has already announced and I quote \u201cHopefully, now that season 3 is being made, I\u2019ll have the chance to wipe away that regret and replace it with something I\u2019m proud of.\u201d So in case you were critical of certain weaknesses you have found in the manga, you have something to look forward to this season.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nSince starting AoT, I have always been astonished by its art ever since the first episode when I got those goosebumps. Art is certainly a major strength of this series and I was afraid it would have fallen out of touch before starting this season. You can imagine my joy when I found out the art is still as beautiful as ever and has actually been polished a step further. The animation is breathtaking and the atmosphere is as bloody as ever with a tiny gap that lets in rays of happiness reflecting in the cast\u2019s tears.\\n\\n\r\nHere is a small fact about me, I am a gore maniac. Thus, seeing the bloodshed, cut skin and ripped out intestines is of outmost importance to my gore-loving self. Luckily enough, AoT doesn\u2019t fall behind in its beautiful display of the aforementioned and, as a matter of fact, this season might be the best so far if you oddly enough share my same interests. Since the titans evaporate after being killed we don\u2019t get a fair display of carnage, but this season seems to shine best in that regard. After so few episodes we have witnessed various colors of torture up to the number of episodes so far, this review is as of episode 6, which should be enough to please you if you are in it for the dark plot.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe most notable thing here is that so far we didn\u2019t have as many screams from Eren as we\u2019ve had in previous seasons. Of course, that is to be expected given this is a more serious arc about political conflicts and struggle for power. The OST is befits the show with the OP and ED being best described as fun while the music during the show goes well with the action providing an ecstasy for any action fan.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development:\\n\r\nI don\u2019t know about you, but Levi is one of my favorites in the series right after Hange and luckily all of the scouts have been getting an adequate amount of character development from the very beginning. We get to see them all from a new perspective because of the new enemy they are facing and how each of them is constantly changing be it for the better or the worse. I have to say, I\u2019m enjoying Levi being a lead for this part and can affirm that if you like Levi, then you are in for a treat.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThis series certainly isn\u2019t for everyone, but if you are among the lucky ones who enjoyed the first two seasons, then shut your ears to all the hate you\u2019ve been hearing and take my word for you will definitely enjoy this season just as much if not more than the previous ones. If you happen to be skeptical of the theme of politics hindering your dose of tantalizing action, I can tell you that the action is more than enough and more amazing than words can describe. The style we are used to is here and is polished up sharper than we have ever seen. I have been having a blast so far this season and I am sure any fan of AoT would say the same.\\n",

            "content": "*THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*\r\nIn my opinion the second season of AOT was mediocre, the first one was mostly empty shock value and sensless action. This season has been boring me to death. It abandons everything form the last season and starts a new subplot that I just don't think is interesting.\r\nStory: \r\nAs I mentioned before the story has shifted into a new direction, now the government is bad and they want to kill Eren. He get's kidnapped for the third time and Historia becomes an edgy brat. It becomes so complicated that the show needs 3 flashbacks per episode just to explain what the hellis going on. It went from a pretty good titans vs humans mistery story to a cliche civil war type story.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are extremly weak, the writer had to add some random superficial character trait's just to make them seem less boring, take Levi for example I can't even consider him a character. He's more like a plot device that's only there to move the story foward by telling the other characters what they need to do, so to make him seem a little more like an actual character the autor aded that he likes cleaning, that's what lazy character writing looks like. And the other characters are the same, the only thing they have is 1 character trait and that's it. Also the development is flat, it's always just a monologue where they talk about stuff that doesn't add anything to the story, they try to stuff emotions down our throats to hide the unpolished story and character development just like Boku no hero academia for example.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and animation: \\n\\n\r\nThe character art retains the same style but removes the thick black outlines that the character's had in the last season. It's good and polished in some places. Im not a big fan of their style but that's subjective. The backrounds however were horrible, they were mostly just a still image behind the characters. It lacked a sense of depth and just felt disconected from the characters. The images themselves were really plain and uncreative. All of it felt like the artist just didn't care, some backrounds had good art but had the same aforementioned problems.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation blew my mind, i don't understand why one of the most popular and mainstream shows of this entire medium has animation so bland that it made me burst out laughing in some scenes. In 11 episodes they had 2 scenes that are well animated. The rest are just people sitting or standing or some horrible slide shows. When they're using the 3d gear it just feels like they're flying in most scenes. Seriously, compared to the last season it feels like a different anime (in a bad way). Also the CG titan was just pathetic, they were changing all the time between 2d and 3d. It was inconsistent and looked really ugly. There were even lip syncing errors, I don't have a problem with these errors if I konw that the anime has a small budget but this is AOT, their's should be huge (thats what she said XD).\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nAll in all it felt lazy. They cut out some battle scenes form the manga and used a lot of cheap tricks to reduce the animation. The story is getting way to complicated for no reason. The character's are becoming even weaker because their develepment fails. I think it's a huge letdown copared to the second season (maybe they should have spent 4 years on this season too). \\n\r\nThe conclusion is: go watch HunterxHunter if you want an intresting show with good action, animation and an excellent story. I really don't get the hype around this train wreck.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "There are no spoilers in this review.\r\nSeason 3 truly shines in its ability to present us with some progress towards the answers we've waited for while fleshing out its cast and lore in an organic way. With its great handle on production quality, characterization and story development, I believe Season 3 elevates AoT from something that could be considered a decent popcorn-flick to something truly memorable in its execution.\r\nBefore I get into the story and characters, I think right off the bat this anime has to be praised for its STELLAR animation and soundtrack. I think WIT's work here rivals that of Ufotable's in someareas, which is saying a lot. The action sequences are extremely well choreographed, and the animation is consistent, crisp and never really dips. The soundtrack also features some of Sawano's best. Don't get me wrong, as I'll discuss below the story and characters are definitely great, but the production value distinguishes Season 3 above most other shows in a fantastic way.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow, the story of AoT has always been intriguing and interesting for the most part. The risk AoT took with Season 3, or the Uprising arc in general, was stepping back from the Titan killing to flesh out the questions we've all had for several arcs. Notice I say 'step back', not 'ignore'. Many people would try to convince you otherwise and say Season 3 only focuses on people, but the fact remains that Titans are still an integral part of this arc and actually have a more interesting purpose than just being killed on screen all the time. This arc perfectly balances three things: giving us answers to questions, fleshing out characters and keeping us engaged in an interesting story with a fantastic pace.\\n\\n\r\nThe first thing: giving us answers to questions. I will say some of the big questions we have about Titans are indeed answered in this arc, and (at least for me) they did not disappoint. I do admit there were times where really big reveals were just casually mentioned, which sometimes made it hard to recognize what is important and what isn't. But as you get deeper into the season (or if you decide to binge watch it in one sitting, which is what I did on my second rewatch with multiple people), you'll find the parts connect rather well. Of course, AoT is great at answering questions but also keeping us in suspense, so be warned: some questions will be answered, but other questions will rise up. \\n\\n\\n\r\nIn Seasons 1 and 2, I thought the characters in the show were...alright. Some were more interesting than others, but overall no one really stuck out. In particular, the intriguing story and world of Aot overshadowed the characters, and I really just watched for the suspense of what happened next in the plot development. I didn't have any interest in the characters or their development. Even though Season 2 made an attempt to flesh out some of the cast, I still found the season too short to make me care fully.\\n\\n\r\nSeason 3 has changed all that. Not only did it manage to add nuance and depth to characters that I thought would stay rather one-note, but it did it in the same time frame as Season 2 and to a larger effect. Characters I didn't even care for in Seasons 1 and 2 are now some of my favorites not just in this show, but perhaps among most shows in general. And not just people in the known cast, but new additions come up that have such life and presence that you can't forget them. It's no exaggeration when I say Season 3 introduces some of the best characters in AoT to date while bringing out the best in the rest of its cast.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow, the pacing of AoT has been something discussed quite alot. I actually found the pacing of AoT's first two seasons pretty well-done already, but Season 3 completely revitalized the formula. Bouts of amazing action are balanced with nice, well-done sections of story development and characterization. Whether you're watching an amazingly animated fight sequence or a backstory about certain characters, you'll never feel like the content is something out-of-place. Each episode manages to pack compelling developments in character and story in perfect capacity. \\n\\n\r\nAs for any flaws in this show, I'd say having watched the show weekly, the first few episodes were somewhat hard to follow because things are happening too fast; while there was stellar action in these episodes, the plot was somewhat loose and it felt like things were being rushed. However, as the show went on, that balance of fast-paced action with slower-paced story development kicked in, and everything started to flow nicely. Also, upon a binge rewatch everything fit quite nicely. And while some characters in this season get immense characterization and development, some (not a lot, but definitely some) still feel sort of dry and bland. However, this is just a small blemish on an otherwise perfect addition to the AoT anime. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Season 3 might be my favorite season of AoT because it manages to deliver on the set up of the first two seasons. The characters have way more depth and nuance to them, the animation is through the roof and the show has shown us its not all about action and suspense, but also about telling us a great story. Although it's sad that AoT won't be coming back til April, as long as WIT can keep up this same level of quality in AoT's production value, I'm not complaining. Season 3 is a game changer for AoT, and I believe it marks the transition of AoT from a decent shounen to a fantastically intricate show.\\n",

Its pace is perfect - nothing is tedious; I couldn't tell that some parts of the manga for this current arc was written while its author was sick. Maybe one factor that did make it obvious the author was sick was the lack of filling plotholes once or twice. \r\nWhatelse is there to talk about season 3? If you're reading this, you've probably watched season 2 and 1, no? Well, Wit studios didn't do any worse than the previous seasons. \\n\\n\r\nSo far SnK is entertaining me because lots of secrets about humanity is becoming revealed, the Scouts are making a huge impact than ever before in impacting human history, and solving the mystery of Eren's key is getting closer.\\n\\n\r\nI never liked SnK's lack of love for its characters! Please have some pity for the characters! They are all dying like bugs! They are human beings - stop killing people. SnK keeps making a depressing atmosphere where there seems to be no hope for the future of humanity unless a brilliant French Revolution is instigated! Nothing about the French Revolution is positive, and it's just dark, just like this anime is.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I love about SnK, though, is that I can connect to the characters in that I, too, am also trapped behind walls, and desire a French Revolution for the future of humanity. The adrenaline this show gives me is amazing and it kept me going when I was working out!",

The story is fast paced, and the anime clearly has the budget and effort to back up its storytelling. It's thrilling around every corner. Every episode is solid, having either brilliantly animated action or interesting plot reveal. (Sometimes an episode has both.)\r\nI'd say the dialogue is a little cringe-inducing and sometimes it relies on cheapertechniques to move the plot along, but I find that these hardly detracted from enjoyment. (Eren's crying after being unchained was not a quality scene at all, but I don't mind it too much.)",

            "content": "From the mysteries of the second season, now the third season takes the reins with political upheaval along with all those mysteries uncovered and still withstanding in the first and second seasons...with varying degrees of success.\r\nShingeki no Kyojin Season 3 is a good continuation from the second season and how this season takes it's direction less from the Titans and more so in the government and the people inside the walls with a political upheaval in the mix of it all.\r\nLA will say like LA said about the second season but Krista or Historia has ALOT of screentime in this season and all the morefor it with how much plot significance and how much of focal point Historia has at the anime at large with Eren tagging along, which oddly enough they have a small but impactful link with one another and this in turn makes them targets for the King, Eren for his Titan powers and Historia for other reasons with Kenny Ackerman on their tail. On talking about character development, the development for most of the characters are spread around sparsely to say the least with little interactions from the main cast to gauge us how or what the characters are feeling or change in personalities, small ones like Jean and his quandary of having to kill people not titans to Erwin's dilemma of the social structure and injustice of the people inside the walls and heck some characters LA wasn't expecting to get character development no matter how small. Historia and Eren getting the spotlight is a given but those little interactions help to say the least especially with such a huge ensemble cast. \\n\\n\r\nSo with the political upheaval, comes into Historia significance of the plot and how this pertains to Eren and to be honest as daft as the plot sounds, it DOES makes sense how they are linked, no thanks to both Historia and Eren's past family failures and ambitions. Though the political upheaval is taken as expected in these kind of plotlines you know \"corrupted\" as per usual, it's more or less HOW they are overthrown with the main cast with their backs to the wall in how they turn everything around which is one of the more better executed moments in this season as anti-climactic and predictable as it was. \\n\\n\r\nWith Shingeki no Kyojin Season 3, there are plot twists as per usual but more so there are SOME form of answers given, like the King and how the government works in a better or should LA say corrupted light, Historia's backstory and how this links with Eren and gives the barking, shouting main protagonist some new light to his character in the process especially with his hatred of Titans and how Historia utterly takes the spotlight once again with her involvement, not to mention how she later pertains to the plot and the changing social structure as a result of the overthrown government.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation once again done by Wit Studio, the animation was consistent and very well detailed right down the awesome fight scenes as sparse as that was in this season with the lesser Titan killing and more human villains of this third season but nonetheless the choregraphy to the planning of the battles as well as the more insane things that occurs in this third season was beautifully and viscerally animated with the consistency to boot, Wit Studio did it again in this front at the very least.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was great and expected with the returning and new characters in the mix with Kazuhiro Yamaji as Kenny as the gruff suave badass Kenny to once again Shiori Mikami flexing her range as Historia even more than ever in this season as well. Yui Ishikawa, Marina Inoue and Yuki Kaji gets decent coverage as their respective roles, though LA felt that Yui Ishikawa as Mikasa got lesser screentime, no thanks in part to Historia getting more focus but nonetheless. Overall voice work was expectedly good for a continuation. \\n\\n\r\nShingeki no Kyojin Season 3 Part 1 was in LA's eyes the more human side of corruption in comparison to looking at the more Titan corruption of the second season, looking more into the societal injustice than the mysteries of the Titans, sure the third season part 1 does have it's mysteries it digs up and answering some, but even then the characters more than anything shows much more of a precedent to this time around and with that, the third season part 1 was a success in LA's eyes, Shingeki no Kyojin took it to another new direction, but was still focused and it executed itself quite well in this regard.\\n\\n\r\nNow there is a second season...of this third season announced (you know much like how Shokugeki no Souma's San no Sara did with theirs), LA saying \"third season part 1\" being quite obvious to this fact, leaving the first part of the third season where the main cast are on their way to the elusive basement..and as much LA hates the entire \"splitting cours\", LA is more than graceful in saying that if Wit Studio need to the time to refine their work, or you know..rest then that's fine by LA, but LA expects the same standards or maybe even surpassing that for this Part 2.",

            "content": "As of the writing of this review, only the Uprising Arc has been shown. I have read the manga, and to be honest this arc was my least favorite, since it was very stretched out and kinda boring. But to my surprise, the anime is the exact opposite! WIT Studio has done an incredible job at translating this slow-paced arc into an amazing, interesting and incredible anime.\r\nStory (8): Even though they sped up this arc, the beginning was still a bit slow. But many great anime suffer from the same problem, so you should never judge an entire anime just on the first few episodes.The quality of the story became better and better after each episode, and it probably won't stop going into the next arc this season.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8): Beautiful art, just as in the previous seasons. The CGI used in this season is actually a lot better than in the previous one (that colossal problem was horrible). But in this season it's quite alright.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9): Man, it has been said a lot, but Hiroyuki Sawano is like the Hans Zimmer of anime. Every single anime he worked on has a soundtrack beyond amazing. \\n\r\nAlthough most people don't like the opening and say 'the ending and opening should be switched', I actually really like the opening. But yes, the ending is way better, but the opening is great too, don't be so butthurt.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9): Levi and Mikasa are just as bad-ass as ever and still remain to be my favorite characters. Although now, we're introduced to Kenny the Ripper, someone who can compete with them on my favorite character list. I don't know why, but I'm just a sucker for bad-ass killing machines. \\n\r\nAnd I guess Eren and the rest are there too...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10): Even though the beginning was a bit slow, this arc is definetaly one of my favorties. From such a slow and boring manga arc to this incredible anime arc. Just goes to show how well WIT Studio is handling this series. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (10): There is not much to complain about this season. I enjoyed it all the way up until now and I will continue to enjoy it for the remaining episodes. I honestly can't wait to see the next arc animated!!",

            "content": "5s Across the board.... For F--k Sake...\r\nThe only scene I liked was the last scene after the credits and even then, it still had no payoff, just like most of this season. Its like hey, you wanna see cool shit? Alright! Wait until next season to see that cool shit! Cause all you get now is build up for it!\r\nStory -- 5;\r\nWith nothing but politics this entire third season and for some reason fannys, and I don't use that term lightly, thinking its great for reasons unknown. Simple things amuse simple minds I suppose. Which is why attack on titan gets rated so high yetis shit!\\n\\n\r\nI won't use that word again because I don't judge people for the shows they like, I believe you're allowed to like whatever the hell you want and fuck peoples opinions, they don't matter not even mine. \\n\\n\r\nBut heres my thoughts anyways, so the politics could be good, but all it is is random talk, its actually just a big facade of people in power doing bad things because yeah, thats always original, who would of thought the people in charge would be bad guys??? Most of the conversations in this entire show are literally nothing more then saying lets go fight this and then talking about plans on how to fight them and what to do and then when they get to fight its either a minute and over or a 5 second montage of action scenes that amount to nothing.\\n\\n\r\nThere was no fun, no thriller, nothing interesting, almost everything we learned about the titans was meaningless, yet it did advance the plot but you don't care because it ruins old plotlines they created, I actually gave the first season a 9 for the action and ideas alone, the choreography was stunning and even though the characters weren't that likable and a bit one dimensional there was still enough twists and turns to keep it well.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are reading this, you've probably seen the other two seasons, season 2 I didn't give a 9 I gave a 3, so hey at least season 3 gets a 5. Because it didn't have a shitty titan reveal or worthless dialogue, and it didn't feel like 12 episodes of complete shiste & nothingness.\\n\\n\r\nBoth seasons had horrible dialogue and horrible action, the only thing that gives season 3 the two extra brownie points is the fact that the story actually went somewhere this time. Except you still ruined attack on titan...\\n\\n\r\nIn season two we forget about the final scene that shows titans in walls and then spend 12 episodes talking and fighting and making it known others can be titans & after introducing these new titans and these new factions, they all get to be ignored this season. Making two pretty much again, useless... .... ...\\n\\n\r\nThis season they address the titans by making it known --- --- (Spoiler Alert) --- --- That there is magical blood lines that created the titans, and that the king was controlling the country with titans using a titan that can remove peoples memorys and that we can give titan blood and create titans whenever we want because yeah yeah yeah yeah drama drama drama drama. Not to mention that the Arthur trys to say well the reason no one knows we make the titans and control the kingdom were already in control of is because some special bloodlines are immune to the mind eraser titan because that makes sense to. Its all magic, everything real about the show just got turned in magic and thats the explanation but yet your combining magic with science and needles and steampunk ODM gear. Alright yeah that makes attack on titan more epic then it was before. \\n\r\nAt least when you though the titans were science based or some form of nature it made the crystal hardening and the abnormal titans even more interesting but now its just a magic roll of the dice titan tv show that I hate. What a shitty choice to make.\\n\r\n--- --- --- (END OF THE SPOILER ALERT) --- --- ---\\n\\n\r\nYou just spent an entire season saying you dont know where titans came from, this is the fight against them there is an outside titan force introduced in season 2, yet season 3 is just meandering about titans inside the walls, so now its everyone vs everyone and we don't know who to trust and before we know it doors and trees and animals will be titans next and there will be the sun and the moon titan and what the fuck ever.... I made that up about the doors and trees titans but at this rate I wouldn't be surprised if the Arthur thought that was super duper creative and did it anyways.\\n\r\nI accepted the abnormal titans but come on, this is ridicules let alone the origins I refuse to mention here because I just did above in that spoiler sentence so read it there if you'd like. But the origins story, actually ruins the realistic tension of titans being a threat. And really puts a shit ton of loopholes in the story on how the hell that origin story works. Which the Arthur trys to explain with more loops holes mentioned once again in the spoiler above.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters; -- 3\\n\r\nWell Eren isn't just screaming and yelling like he was in season 2, but is he back to season 1? No... Season 1 all he wanted to do was kill titans, thats cool thats acceptable, season 2 he yells and is pissed he isn't in control and is a hostage and that entire season was just worthless drama let alone the 2 titan reveals that were total shit,\\n\\n\r\nSeason 3 Eren at least talks and discusses things, but do we get any character development? No... I remember nothing that eren said that mattered, none of the politics discussed mattered, honestly eren was just in chains and a hostage again for 3-4 episodes but at least it wasn't the entire season like the 2nd.\\n\\n\r\nMikasa is still obsessed with eren like always and will defend him like always, we have this new gal historia but she isn't really important in the second half besides for like 2 episodes and as a love interest for Erens new found harem storyline starting to take root.\\n\\n\r\nWe get a bunch of old characters back and are supposed badass Eli or whatever his name is, (I remember he is Levi) But because he did nothing in season 2 but clean house I didn't care, but now in season three none of them really do anything important. Levis squad is completely gone its pretty much him and Eren and some others you won't remember. & Levi being super dramatic and staring with spooky dark shadows under his eyes and his hand outstretched dramatically....\\n\r\nLike hes about to go Kalii maaa Kali maaa Kalii maa and take his heart like some shit out of indiana jones.\\n\\n\r\nWe did however have one thing that mattered, and that was new badass guys with guns that shoot large spikes, because when your trapped inside walls and metal is scarce you want to use more rare materials then you would ever need because yeah bullets wont do.\\n\\n\r\nThey can also swing from the ceiling with them like spider man except with guns, and they don't even need the odm gear super narly dude narlastic dude. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation//art//sounds - 5\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, they don't even take the time to animate that well anymore except for like 1 or 2 episodes most of the time its just them swinging through the air endlessly on the same animated track, it is in no way as dynamic as the first season. It actually reminds me of the horribly animated and reused scenes of naruto when they jump tree to tree and talk for 20 minutes. Yeah this is what Attack on titan is coming to.\\n\\n\r\nWhy do I compare it to the first? Because it seems like the writers & Arthur and directors, all said, well we made a successful first season, now the fans are hooked line and sinker, so lets just do shit from now on and what we come up it doesn't matter they will buy it no matter what because they think its so cool, and it kind of worked it just seems that the backlash of the extreme lameness of season 2 got such a hate filled rage that season 3 they made the show juuuuuust aaaaa litttttleeeee better! Ya know. Like just enough to wet the fans garments.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment --- 5\\n\r\nI enjoyed some of the ideas, but the first 2 episodes and then episode 8-11 are like the only things you need to watch.\\n\r\nEverything else is a complete waste of time,, there might be something between episodes 3-7 but for me there wasn't Besides all of that new titan stuff that I guess won't be being put to use until the second cour, even though the titan stuff was the only good thing.\\n\\n\r\nBut even with those few highlights, the way they are done is just so boring and pathetic... I rolled my eyes at every reveal, I had to force myself to listen to the dialogue even though nothing anyone said this season mattered, Except for the few flashbacks that linked a few characters together but they once again were never used.\\n\\n\r\nOverall --- 5 \\n\\n\r\nOver all I found that most of the \"\"\"Powers\"\"\" you see this season, could have never been added, season 2 shouldn't of existed either, what makes me so upset with what has happened with this show is this.\\n\\n\r\nI accepted the titans, I accepted the ODM gear because it was animated well the first season, & I went as far as to accept Eren turning into a titan because his scientist dad did it.\\n\\n\r\nWhat ruins is, is that you took a show that had fantasy and realism, and then shit on the realism side that made it fun the first season and went full on fantasy, all of the gore and drama that made it fun is now melodrama,\\n\\n\r\nBy that I mean, its so watered down that its like teen age drama that you just roll your eyes at, relationship issues, and I mean It makes attack on titan feel like a slice of life and then you add action scenes that are badly done whilst trying to make it serious???\\n\\n\r\nI mean that is the formula, you just tried to make people care about a show, without giving them anything to care about.\\n\\n\r\nLet alone the new storylines you added, just put every other storyline out the window.\\n\r\nEren trying to go and fight and take revenge is no longer a thing its like he could care less now.\\n\r\nMikasa being important, nope shes a prop device and tsundere for Eren now.\\n\r\nThe bad Levi, I called him Eli at some point in here, I apologize, is now useless, he twists peoples arms and says edgy shit to sound cool. \\n\r\nNone of the fights are thought out, a lot of people say how can you not love the action, if you watch the first season and the amount of thought that goes into choreography surpasses all of these for example the Levi squad tearing down Ani, ana, whatever that gal titan was, whenever she was a titan, you can see they cut her tendons her eyes they destructed her, it was thought out and planned and that made it cool.\\n\\n\r\nNothing this season has any thought, not the story, the action or the dialogue and barely any thought to its own characters, its just edgy to be edgy and you get promised action not only the build up but long talks about it and then never get the reward.\\n\\n\r\nFINAL THOUGHTS.....\\n\r\nThey say, you cannot have your cake and eat it to, but in this case, there isn't even any cake to look at, the cake was a lie, there was and never will be any. Attack on titan is now just one big lie, that never stops promising something it will never give, and thats good action along with a good story together again, they gave up, just like I did on this show\\n\\n\r\nI'll still watch the second cour because everyone said thats when attack on titan feels like the first season again, but ya know, heres hoping thats true, we can only wait and see.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading & later my dudes & later my loves! - GodOfWolves...",

            "content": "[Spoiler Warning]\r\nComing into Attack on Titan season 3 I was slightly nervous because I heard that this season was going to be more focused on Human vs Human, but by the second episode all my doubts had been relieved and thought It was the greatest shit ever.\r\nVisuals and Animation - 10+\r\nOut of nowhere Studio Wit upped the quality of the production values to a point I didn\u2019t was possible in a TV anime. The Levi vs Kenny Squad sequence in episode 2  had some of the best Sakuga and animation I had ever seen All of anime, let alone TV anime. The amount ofshit going on in that scene literally just made my brain go like, \u201cwhat the fuck that just happened.\u201d Not only did the animation improve but also the art quality improved. In some scenes I was just in awe of how Wit Studio crafted the world of attack on titan so beautifully. \\n\r\nThe only thing I had a slight issue with was some of the CGI cuts. The rod titan was done pretty well but some CGI cuts were not pretty. I Also liked how they designed the crystal basement, thought it looked nice.\\n\\n\r\nSound & Music -10+\\n\r\nHiroyuki Sawano, the man, the myth, the legend. This dude has composed almost  everyone of my favorite soundtracks and is always consistent. Some uneducated people might say all his work is too similar, but guess what? Who tf cares if it is similar all his music amazing and on top of that Attack on titan has in my opinion the best soundtrack in anime EVER. PERIOD. Everyone song in attack on titan sets the mood and tone perfectly and can strike a range of emotions, whether it be sad,inspiring,hype,heartwarming,scary, or nervous every emotions can be felt. Also the last scene when they played the scouts theme and Erwin was getting the scouts and the people hype was fucking heart pounding and gave me goosebumps.\\n\r\nNot only is the soundtrack good but the voice acting and sound effects are excellent as well. Dub and Sub both do a great job.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 9\\n\r\nEren- had some pretty good development learning that he is not special and developed some chemistry with historia and became overall more mature, only issue I had was he sometimes got a little over dramatic and the stretch of episodes where he wanted to be eaten and was called constantly crying got a little old. Though even did come up clutch with that crystallization power and was badass when he through the barrels in rod titans mouth\\n\\n\r\nLevi- We get some much needed depth on Levi\u2019s backstory and see how his mom died and was a prostitute, how he lived with Kenny and when Kenny died how he really showed sadness that his father figure died. Also we get to see how fucking badass he is taking out every mf in his path. He went off against Kenny Squad twice and even injured Kenny. But that chase sequence was something else and just shows us how super human Levi is. Also the scene at the end where he is threatening to break Erwin\u2019s legs so he can\u2019t go on the mission shows how much he cares for Erwin and doesn\u2019t want to see his friend dead, but at the same time when Erwin reveals that he values going on the mission to retake Wall Maria more than humanities victory Levi has to respect Erwin\u2019s dream and let him continue. Also we see how Levi has to mentor the new Levi squad - Connie, Eren, Mikasa, Jean, Sasha, and Armin, to kill other humans and hardens them as shown when the new recruits see that there faces have changed. \\n\\n\r\nHistoria - she gets a lot of development in this season, first we see her backstory how her mom was rod reiss\u2019 mistress and didn\u2019t care for her in the slightest. We also see her develop a relationship with Freda, who she remembers when rod shows her the erased memories through his magic bloodline power. Historia for the first half of the season is manipulated by rod who wants her to become a titan so he can get off on his God fantasy. Historia who is blinded by the memory of Freda blindly follows and at the last second changes her mind and breaks the syringe and flips Rod. This a huge development because historia is finally taking control of her own destiny and doing what she feels is right. When historia was made queen I thought it was going to be weird but AOT pulled it off and Historia gets her huge payoff when she cuts ties with Rod completely by cutting the last piece of him, thus ending his life and breaking historia completely free of her past. Also Historia gets closer with eren and Mikasa catches wind of this in episode eleven when she gives Eren the Death Stare.\\n\\n\r\nErwin - Uh oh, the Erwin death flags are high after episode twelve, with Levi showing concern for his safety on the mission to retake Wall Maria. Moving on, Erwin starts of this arc being arrested for murder he didn\u2019t commit and having dramatic conversations with pixus and Nile.\\n\r\nHe then comes up with a badass plan to fake a titan invasion and turns the table on the aristocratics running the government, who panic and want to quarantine Wall rose. This doesn\u2019t sit well with pixus or Nile so they overthrow the government and head for eren. We also see Erwin\u2019s backstory and how his father was killed because he found out too much about the world and that drives Erwin to uncover the truth of the titans and the world. Finally, Erwin gets the send off he deserves rallying the crowd and the soldiers. \\n\\n\r\nMikasa- she doesn\u2019t really get that much focus into her character but does have some pretty cool fight scenes but we do see her mood improve when eren goes back to his normal scrappy self when he fights jean.\\n\\n\r\nArmin- in ep 2 armin gets his first human kill and gets emotional about it, he starts to show maturity and is more useful to the scouts also he cross dresses and gets felt up which was weird, reminds Eren about dream to go she the sea\\n\\n\r\nJean, Connie, and Sasha - we get see just how More mature they become when in the first battle vs Kenny squad they are indecisive and nervous and then in the second fight they just straight up murder people from the Kenny squad. When I saw my boy Jean slice that dudes neck and Connie also kill someone I was like \u201cfuck they really out here killing people.\u201d Also that scene when they are hype for the send off was pretty funny\\n\\n\r\nKenny - personality was super unique and he was a really cool character his fights with Levi were pretty hype and the whole gunman style of him in his squad was really dope. His death was pretty sad and the story of how he came to live with Levi was well done only issue I have with him is he died before his character was completely fleshed out.\\n\\n\r\nPlot - 9.5 \\n\r\nFinally the PLOT! I appreciated the change in direction and commitment to focusing on character development rather than Titans. Although I did think the bloodline power thing was sorta whack the story was overall good. All though I am pissed that series is taking a break because I was hype to see them retake Wall Maria but whatever.",

            "content": "Other than the male x male shipping, I am not finding many reasons to like this show anymore.\r\nHalf of the season is practically a collection of cliche action scenes. People teleport from the sky to save the day, others swing in the sky with spider-man gears, evil people sit on the face of someone just to prove that they indeed evil, Levi declares he is an insane badass by committing an act that distantly resembles the twisting of an arm. So fucked up! I am scared, literally how can man be this insane. Please, no, not the arm. \r\nThe other half is practically a parodyof politics except the narrative itself doesn't recognize this lameness as a parody. People with might and power declare a thing, but another thing happens -- much like with the teleporting nakama in the action side -- other big guys teleport whenever important decisions are supposed to be made. Essentially every part of the politics is so one-dimensional it hurts and serves as an excuse to create more bullshit to fill the story with. These vary from random kidnapping incidents to people thinking one of their nakama dies if they don't hurry up. I am not sure how exactly am I supposed to be fooled by this when it is clear plot-armors in the series are thicker than the walls itself.\\n\\n\r\nThe best part of this show are the supposedly evil people and \"our\" enemies. Whenever our main squad gets called subhumen or pseudo-soldiers by them, I agree whole-heartedly. The opposing party did nothing wrong when looking down on our plebeian children at arms. Which this show really is all about. Some kids acting like they matter, fighting against titans or being titans or hiding from titans behind walls made of titans. At least the first season was fun to watch because it was a complete disaster and so overboard idiotic. This isn't even ironically fun anymore. More meaningless events one after another.\\n\\n\r\nThis season doesn't achieve anything. It's just Eren being chained half the time + farming, characters pondering over some action for half an episode each episode just to see the thing itself never happening. It's all false tension, all words no reward, no payout. Boring substance that is repetition of the same over and over while the fallacy that something might actually happen being there to fool those who are still buying this. Oh no, titan appears for the 700th millionth time, what a shock, I wonder which one of the two things that ever happen when a titan appear, happens this time around. Literally can't wait for the next cour.",

            "content": "In a desolate world where corruption, power, and control rules all, Attack on Titan feels like a story that goes far deeper than just survival. As someone who has been following the series for several years, this franchise has really made a reputation. I\u2019m not even talking about the commercial sales revenue or fan base. I\u2019m talking about how this show evolved from a war between Humans and Titans.\r\nAfter only a year, Attack on Titan made its grand return. Given the popularity of the franchise, this was inevitable but the big surprise was how soon it got announced. The first season ran for 2-cour in2013 while the second season ran for only a single cour in Spring 2017. Yet, here we are with a third season after just one year. As a fan myself, I\u2019m more than pleased to say that the third season continues to live up to its household name. It\u2019s a franchise that truly deserves its acclaim.\\n\\n\r\nWatching the third season will make fans quickly realize the change of mood in the very beginning. In fact, this season may not be what you are used to and will take some time to adapt with. The lack of Titans is evident from the first few episodes. Attack on Titan has been praised in the past before for its great action. Not only does the production quality and rhythm enhance the experience, the show itself always managed to capture the momentum of every battle. Here we are in third season and it takes a step back with the fighting between Titans and humanity. Rather, we have humanity dealing with its own problems - internal issues and political conflicts along with deep secrets that runs in the veins of key characters.\\n\\n\r\nFor a long time, we\u2019ve seen the political conflicts inside the walls and government. Coming into the third season had me wondering how much we take a dive into exploring that side. And to my pleasant surprise, this season made a clear point that Titans are not the only enemies in their world. In fact, humans are also part of the problem and our main characters have to find a way to deal with it. For instance, Levi\u2019s Squad faces off against adversaries that challenges them to life-and-death scenarios. Levi also faces a dangerous individual from his past, a man named Kenny. You may have heard him screaming in the promotional video but that scream isn\u2019t just a battle cry. It\u2019s the realization that he has to deal with his own personal demon. It\u2019s not just him either but the realization of actually having to kill humans will test the mental limits of our characters. \\n\\n\r\nAs in all of the Attack on Titan seasons so far, we take a look at background storytelling for some of the important characters. From this season, we take a look at Historia, Kenny, Keith, and even a bit of Eren\u2019s mother, Carla. The key selling point is how these characters' stories connect with the overall plot. It\u2019s imperative that viewers understand them as these stories reveal characters\u2019 motivations and how their actions influences the present. To me, I think Attack on Titan always managed to capture a viewers\u2019 attention through its characterization. The creator wants the audience to understand these characters by both telling and showing. It\u2019s accomplished with important dialogues and actions motivated by a clear set of goals. I can\u2019t really talk exactly the precise details as it would be spoilers but the big picture to realize here is why these characters are created. Attack on Titan Season 3 also made me understand why characters are motivated to do certain things and is an accomplishment not to be overlooked. The amount of psychology and emotions makes the story impactful too even for newer characters like Kenny. In terms of plot elements, the show continues to heighten the mystery. Attack on Titan has been known to create a feeling of suspense and there\u2019s no doubt this season will surprise you.\\n\\n\r\nIn the present, main protagonist Eren finds himself in more trouble than just a death sentence. I would say this season made him feel less relevant at first until you realize what\u2019s at stake. Eren\u2019s connection to the past is one of the key mysteries in the show that probably had fans formulate theories all the way back in 2013. Here we are 5 years later and some of that mystery has answers. In the meantime, characters such as Erwin and Pyxis also play important roles with consequences. The plot evolves to become much more complicated than just a war against Titans. It becomes an internal war of complex ideologies. There\u2019s also many revelations that shows how certain characters have connections with each other. And to add on to the cherry on top, we do still get fighting segments for you action junkies.\\n\\n\r\nSeason 3 takes a different approach this time but retains its ability to tell a memorable story. It managed to hook me in the beginning once realizing how important character roles are. Through its characterization, it showed me that the show doesn\u2019t need fancy action and cinematics to make a well-polished anime. Sure, that part isn\u2019t entirely absent but is limited compared to the previous seasons. Whether that\u2019s an appeal will be for you to judge. Just do realize that Attack on Titan doesn\u2019t always need people drawing out their blades and sticking it into Titans\u2019 necks.",

            "content": "*Minimum Spoiler Review*\r\nTL;DR: If every weird conspiracy theory you had for SnK suddenly started becoming true... Well that's this season of SnK for you. From Titans dying like Titanic to Internal Gov'ts crashing like US Stock exchange on day two, this first cour of SnK will leave you screaming... KENNEEYYYYYYY! \r\nIf you didn't watch S1 & S2, don't even bother reading or watching this anime.  \r\n[Story: 7/10 , Characters: 8/10, Art: 9/10, Sound: 8/10, Enjoyment: 8/10]\r\n\"You Levi. You grown any yet\" - Kenny Ackerman\r\nThis season of Shingeki no Kyojin or Attack on Titan should really be called Attack on Internal Government. From military coupsto Historia becoming a waifu boo and Eren slapping himself to stop being Eren, this season definitely stands out from all the previous seasons... good or bad? Let's find out. What originally was supposed to be a 2-cour anime by Wit Studio, they throw another curveball towards fans by making it 1-cour due to budget & work constraints. That's alright since the anime delivers through their concise story adaptation, developed secondary characters, great non-hype music and as always stellar art & animation style. However, after finishing watching it, it will always leave you feeling empty as this season was less substance but more action, overall.  \\n\\n\r\n\"Who decides... Who will you trust?\" Erwin Smith\\n\\n\r\nFrom the story stand point, director Araki & Koizuka did a phenomenal job taking some of the most boring drawn out manga arcs and presenting them in a different order to retell the author's story. Though S3 seems like it starts out of nowhere as no continuation is felt from previous season, you are immediately thrown into the internal world of life inside the wall with high paced action of people fighting people using ODMG but instead of swords vs swords we now have swords vs GUNS. Great job hooking puzzled viewers in and over the course of this anime we get to learn the real truth behind how politics is actually governed inside the wall. From who's pulling the strings, history of royal blood and finally the truth behind the man Eren's father really was. The best takeaway would be wondering, who really is the hero or rather who is actually doing what's morally right as shown through juxtaposing the childish views characters once had of this world vs adult views now they have chosen to accept. Who really thinks for the people and who are just selfish power hungry trash. The manga arc was boring but the director paced the story well for viewers to bite through it as well as some flashback stories of two key characters in this anime really solidifies Erwin's purpose of proving his father's hypothesis. \\n\\n\r\n\"The person that I killed... I bet they were a nice person. Someone that was much more human than I am...\" - Armin Arlert\\n\\n\r\nThe main reason this anime gets praise this season is because we learn a lot of the history behind characters who we were somewhat curious about. This anime is no longer about Eren but more about the people inside the wall vs the beings outside the wall. From focusing on Historia's growth to Levi's tragic past and shedding light on the Ackerman Family & Reiss Family line, we get a sense of how the chess pieces are moving or have been moving all throughout history for mankind to come to this sort of standpoint. The anime also explores the change in psyche soldiers like Armin, Sasha, & Jean go through as they now have to cope with killing humans not just titans, a huge taboo. The beatdown lecture Levi tells them about we kill those who will harm us as self-defence & to protect our close ones parallels with IRL military soldiers and how they are trained to kill \"units\" not people. Because if you humanize your enemy, you will have hesitation vs treating them like \"beasts\". That's one interesting take-way from this season. Also huge shoutout to characters like Kenny & Hange, keeping the anime fresh with their torture techniques. Not to mention, the seiyuus for this season who were able to tell the story more through the anguish in their voice. Huge kudos to them. \\n\\n\r\n\"I never said who was right or wrong. I don't even know myself.\" - Levi \\n\\n\r\nAside from the somewhat linear story arc & developed secondary characters, time after time, if there is one thing this studio does justice, it's their animation & art style. This season they nailed it as well. Every panel was hand-drawn really well. The action sequences flowed really well. We harp the studio for taking forever releasing the anime but atleast they never flake on us on quality. The background score was really hype throughout all the fight sequences and the drops right before key enigmatic moments definitely escalates the excitement each episode. What stood out most though, was the opening of the anime. We are so accustomed to hype opening songs such as Feuerroter Pfeil and Bogen & Die Fl\u00fcgel der Freiheit by REVO of Linked Horizon that when a slow melodious anti-hype casual song as Red Swan by X Japan came to be opening song fans were lost and confused. This wasn't the SnK they knew and came to love. However, it grows with time and you get why that opening song was used instead of hype songs as this season wasn't about humans vs titans but more humans vs humans. This was what the directors wanted to drive home and by using opening song as this he set the battlefield for just that. So great foresight from their part. \\n\\n\r\n\"Go on and torture me already. That's all I did with this blood-stained hands of mine\" - Djel Sannes\\n\\n\r\nOverall, SnK S3 wasn't that bad of an anime. Is it as hype & story packed as previous seasons? Not really but given the manga arc the directors were working with, they did a pretty good job. By following not the path the mangaka, Isayama,  had originally planned out to this new pacing, it served justice to the anime viewers. Though the studio will take a break after 1-cour and continue part 2 from Spring (hopefully) it will be worth it to not read ahead and spoil ourselves in my opinion. Attack on Titan has come to terms to know what their recipe for success is and that's minimizing Eren's wailing and maximizing Erwin's madness. Without spoiling too much, the series ends with their purpose tied back to the beginning. Definitely looking forward to the next season or second part as that will be real jaw-dropping moment for most fans out there who has yet to spoil themselves. Nevertheless, there is no point not watching this season of AoT. You've already invested in the first and second season, might as well binge watch this season. That's always the best way to watch this anime. The anime is building up to their denouement so why hop off the train now. Anyways, check it out & let me know later how you like it as well as share with me your favourite quote from the anime! Ciao.\\n\\n\r\nP.S. Thank you for reading.

            "content": "After a little bit more than a year of wait fan favorite Attack on Titan is back with it's 3rd season and as always we are eager to see what's in store for us this time.\r\nStory 10/10\r\nIt continunes few days after where we left off last season and it focuses more on political drama and dilemmas inside the walls. This season gets straight to the point and introduces new villain named Kenny that turns out to be somehow related to Levi. There are many parties trying to get Eren and Historia. For what reason? It is yet to be reveald. Mystery we all feel inlove with is still there and there are even more questions, but don't let that distract you from the fact that this season ,even tho is only few episodes in, already has some major reveals in it. Pacing is amazing and i wasn't bored for a moment while watching. Things are only getting more interesting when Erwin reveals how he's planning to ovethrow the governmant without using the force. This season has a very refreshing and different plot compared to previous ones as we can see from the lack of titans and focuse on the issues inside the walls rather than beyond. However it's still as, if not more interesting than before. There is world buidling,mystery,back stabbing and some major questions answered which there is hopfully more to come.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nAnimation 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAs we can see characters in this season look a little bit different or older which some might not like but i do personally. It's a fresh change. They look closer to their manga designes. Some might notice that they removed those thick black lines around characters faces which made AOT art stand out even more. Don't get me wrong, it still does but that was something that was missing which kept me from giving it 10/10.\\n\r\nAnimation is brilliant for this season (it's Attack on Titan after all :D) and like every season it only got better. It's almost flawless 6 episodes in. That levi ODM action sequence is some of the best animation i have seen in anime. Perfect combination between 3D background and 2D animation along with masterfull camera movement made this scene look like a movie. It was incredible! While i was watching levi maneuvering trough the city i felt like i was the part of the scene. Levi grappling on the bar and pulling himself towards it made me feel like i was pulled with him. There is even one frame where levi is facing the wall and you can see his reflection in the window. Just goes to show how much detail and time was put in to this scene. After i done some research i found out that it took the animator of this scene 1 whole month to complete it. Just that one scene alone. All props to Arifumi Imai. Great job. Hopfully it keeps this quality because this season is said to be 24 episodes long.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10 \\n\\n\r\nI mean, is there anything to say? AoT is notorious for it's amazing OST and sound quality. Voice actors are great as always and the sound that stand out to me the most was the sound of falling shell from kenny on the roof in ep.1. It was just so satisfying :D. And again mad props to Hiroyuki Sawano (the composer) for the epic and emotional music.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10/10\\n\\n\r\nWhat i like about AoT characters is the fact that they interact so naturally and nothing from their conversation seems forced which is immediately showcased in the very first scene in ep. 1. That cabin scene where jean and eren argue,sasha tries to steal bread, mikasa still does work even tho she's injured and armin cares for her deeply. And of course Levi the clean freak comes in at the end :p They are such fun and lively characters.\\n\r\nThis season already had some major development for our cast. We got to see Erwin's and Hisotira's backstories which also delved deeper in their characters motives. Both backstories were heartbreaking and made me care a lot more for them. Hisotira is slowly taking of her \"Christa Lenz\" facade (is that how you say it? lol) and Erwin is proving again and again why everyone loves him and would follow him to death. His childhood story is very similar to how our society and governmant wokrs today which is very scary. And we all need to remember that isayama is criticizing this type of government and society with these topics. Instead of just walking of Erwin comes back to Dimo Rivees's wife and comforts her saying he'll avange him. Erwin is charismatic,great leader, intellignet and someone that you just want to follow. Since the young age he was corious and as he call himself a \"gambler\". He is someone that would give everything for the humanity. Or is he? I think there is a lot more to his character. Hange got some development too. The way she gathered the information about nick's murder is amazing. After all she is one of the most intelligent characters in this show. She is someone that does what she promises, and she did. She tortured the guy that tortured her friend but after that she shows her other side. She shows human compassion. She repeats how she's starting to feel sorry for them and kicks the table which showcases her frustation and that she actually doesn't like what she has to do. Yeah i know it's hard to believe :D she was always crazy lol. Her weird love for titans makes her character all more interesting and multidimensional. Eren is maturing and seems a lot more chill this season but unfortunately he is kiddnaped again :( Poor guy he just can't catch a break. In ep.1 he helps historia to overcome here pain and shows again just how honest he is by telling her \"I like you more this way, just a stupidly normal honest girl\". Also hugeee development for armin. To think that he would be capable of killing a human.. this will deffinitely have a huge impact on his character in the future. The way he selfreflects and his philosohpical speach about morals is great, it really makes you think. He kinda has a point too. He shows one more time how mentally strong he is even tho he lacks physicial strength. This time is just on another level. Now lets talk about our new villain. KENYYYYYYYYYYY. I love this guy lol. The way he roasts and insults levi and the cowboy vibe he gives. I love it. He immediately showcases that he is not a joke by blowing nifa's head off just like that. He also seems very mysterious. The way he treats levi is almost as if he looks down upon him. Speaking of Levi here is what i think: That chase scene where he's running away from kenny is not just a great action sequence it also represents Levi running from his past. Kenny=His past. Running from kenny or his past. This arc is also big development and challange for him now that he has to act as a leader/commander because erwin is absent or busy. There was also some smaller developments for connie (motivating himself to take on the beast titan),jean (struggling to remain human which almost costs him life, also selfreflecting), sanes (showing how he didn't want to do the things that he has done and over the time he just got used to it, also he was kinda easy to symphatise with too and his devotion to king is may be morally wrong but aslo admirable, the way he feels destroyed after finding out that he was actually the one that betrayed the king is also worth mentioning), flegel (stepping up becoming a boss saying how he'll protect the people of his city), zachary (showcasing that he cares more about himself rather than humanity and how he always hated the governmant because they looked up on everyone).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI never enjoyed AoT more. It's great.This season has perfect balance between story telling, character development and action.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\\n\r\nIt's just getting better and better and hopfully there is more to come :) (P.S. my english is not perfect, hope you can understand :D)",

            "content": "I know what you're thinking. This will be another cliche anime. It's just about killing these weird titans. It's just another \"edgy, shock value\" show with no depth. I'm here to tell you...this show is deeper than what it seems. I discovered this anime a year ago. One boring night i decided to give it a try and I binged the first 9 episodes. But why was I so in to it?\r\nThe surprises. The complexity. The mysteries. The emotions. The music. The animation/art. The lore. The tone. The maturity. The execution. The struggles. It all caught me off guard. What ended up happening was mediscovering my favorite series in any genre, and the first anime to ever make me pick up the manga (and my oh my will the end of Season 3 &amp; 4 be amazing, and I guarantee it will shoot it up to one of the all time great animes).\\n\\n\r\nIt's rare that I discover a show that is unpredictable. It's rare that I discover a show that actually makes me feel. I see criticisms about the story only being about killing titans...that the characters are shallow...that there's no substance...and I truly have to question if we're watching the same show. There are mysteries established from the very first scene. Mysteries that are paid off WONDERFULLY later in the story. There are characters that appear to only be background characters, who end up having an ENORMOUS impact on the story. There are themes and life lessons sprinkled throughout these absurd situations. While the critics only see fighting titans, I see the character development &amp; inner conflicts that arise during these situations. All of this is accomplished without forced humor, over-exaggerated artwork, and childish antics. Isayama successfully casts aside the usual tropes, even killing important characters (which actually makes me fear for the lives of other characters). He ignores the \"friendship will win\" tropes. The \"I'm passionate to beat him\" tropes. Actually, all these situations are presented just to give you the harsh reality that life doesn't always work out that way. This is an amazing experience, and as a manga reader, I promise y'all are in for a ride. Another special shoutout to the music, which is truly an amazing part of the show. \\n\\n\r\nThis show gets a lot of haters. Understandably, like anything else, not everyone will like it. But there's plenty of people who hate on it just cause of its popularity. Or label the writer insane things because they didn't actually read the context of the story. DONT FALL FOR THEM. Be your own judge, notice every small detail of the show. If you're looking for something deep, mature, and refreshing...this show is for you.",

            "content": "I'm so happy this turned out well. Season 3 is exactly what SnK should be. \r\nI didn't think things would necessarily turn out this way, either. In my humble opinion, SnK season TWO was a mess. During the first 6 episodes, the plot, pacing, etc. was completely off and it completely killed the show for me. I wrote a long review about it before but I don't wanna spend too much time talking about SnK s2 when this is about season 3. As season 2 approached the ending, however, it seemed the writing was coming back and I began to enjoy it like I enjoyedseason 1. \\n\\n\r\nNow the writing is in full force, and everything seems to shine. Where should I begin?\\n\\n\r\nEssentially, all of our characters are set up at this point so there's no time wasted with long backstories or explanations. Whenever a backstory does come up, it's quick and does NOT subtract from the plot at all. During season 2 they kinda threw in flashbacks at random, even during critical, suspenseful moments, and it killed the immersion. If that was something you were worrying about -- you won't see that here. The story flows great. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are back and better than ever, too. During season 2 we really missed Levi in all his fighting greatness, but he really shares center stage this season. He's cool, collected, and intelligent -- even more than he was in season 1. He's back to fighting anything willing to stand in the way of his mission, and he's great at it. The show plays on the strengths and personalities of its characters and it really shows. Even though a lot of the season so far is centering around the side characters -- they don't disappoint at all. Not to mention everything is more impactful now that we've spent 2 seasons already with these people. I was looking forward to every moment their plans advanced or fell flat. Even the antagonists are cool. It's annoying to watch a show where the villains are dumb but the heroes always have everything figured out. You don't have to worry about that in SnK s3. There villains seem to be just as capable as the heroes, so you don't know what's going to happen. \\n\\n\r\nI'd say the story itself, so far, is much better than season 1 and season 2. While I enjoyed season 1 a lot, quite a few people complained about the lack of plot progression but I don't think that would be a fair complaint for season 3. During this season we've learned much more about the world, and we have a lot more factions/actors furthering their goals. The pacing is not too fast, and it's not too slow either. The story kept me on edge, with twists and turns that all flow together. I looked forward to each new episode even though the story kept me completely satisfied. What I mean by that is -- I was comfortable stopping at any episode, because I had been thoroughly entertained and I had gotten a lot with each episode. Some shows bore you with a dull episode and then a cliffhanger at the end -- not this one. \\n\\n\r\nThere isn't too much that I can say because I'm only 5 episodes in but I'm just really enjoying myself and wanted to share. Lol. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the art, it's as good as ever. I'm looking forward to seeing the animation during big battles that will come up in the future. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is good too, as it usually is. I feel like we haven't gotten too much of the OST yet so it's unfair to really judge it at this point. While I didn't care for the OP much at first, I have to admit it sounds much better using a quality headset in comparison to the bad speakers I played it on the first time. It isn't my favorite OP, but it's fine IMO. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, my ratings would go like this:\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe reason why I handed out so many 9's is because it's so early in the season so I can't be SURE of any perfection yet, but I can guarantee that I've been enjoying the HECK out of it so far. On the course it's going, I'm sure to at least keep those ratings -- or maybe I'll think it's worth something higher. Hard to say.\\n\\n\r\nRIP I had to reupload this review cause I \"didn't watch 6 episodes\"  before",

It looks like a really bad version of Christopher Vogler\u00b4s narrative structure known as \"The Hero\u00b4s Journey\". I feel that the character development is weak as well, Historia just suddenly decides to switch sides without any \"real\" reason to do so. Yea sure, she has issues when it comes to a parental figures,but how the fuck can someone be convinced to eat a person which was your former ally? The whole structure of the story feels weak, they force the characters \"tragic\" backgrounds on the audience without any chance to let us make up our own thoughts about them. I guess you could say, it\u00b4s too fleshed out. The creators leave no room for imagination imo...",

It's better than wait for four years.\r\nIn this season 3 they focus on human vs. human battles, and show a less titan scene. Those who only watch anime without reading manga, many think it's very boring to watch and they want to see the fight against the titan, for me this arc is the most amazing. \r\nThis shows creativity in the story and shows that Hajime Isayama didn't run out of ideas to make stories, and it proved to be a greatsuccess. He was not too hung up on the titan, but he showed little by little the secret behind the origin of Titan began to unfold. Shows that even inside the wall is as dangerous as outside the wall.",

            "content": "There are few anime these years that are as bloody and brutal as Attack on Titan is, yet don\u2019t use gore in an overly immature way. Although the series itself has generated much hate and criticism, I still believe it has more depth than most people give credit for. From the very first season, we get to see gruesome events of shock and horror, as well as the point of views of numerous soldiers who had to make sacrifices. It sends a message that shows humanity\u2019s determination and resilience even in hopeless situations. It shows that, even though humans have the capacity for selfishness andevil, we also have the ability to feel compassion and courage. AoT\u2019s third season is not much different.  \\n\\n\r\nPlot (7/10): From the very start of the show, we can see a change in the plot\u2019s direction. Rather than a war against the titans, it\u2019s now a fight amongst humans themselves. There are now traitors, people who desire power, and even corruption, that, along with numerous betrayals, it\u2019s hard to know who to trust. There are also major changes made to the structure of the plot. It\u2019s less about mindless violence and killing titans and more about building a relatively complex and mature story. From the backstory about Levi and his relation to Kenny to plot reveals concerning the Reiss family, this season has been an exciting watch. However, there IS a lot less action in this sequel, so your enjoyment may differ depending on what you liked about the previous seasons. If you enjoyed AOT solely for its action and didn\u2019t care much about the story line, you most likely not enjoy this season. For the rest of the fanbase, this season is a must-watch to gain further knowledge about the true details behind the walls (unless you are a manga reader ofc).\\n\\n\r\nBy this time you may be wondering, if I\u2019m praising AoT\u2019s plot so much, why did I only give this category a 7? Well, as much as I want to deny it, the show isn\u2019t completely devoid of flaws. For one, the first few episodes were painfully slow and was just mostly people talking about some political crap. The actual plot behind it was actually very interesting but I felt the producers made the dialogue too redundant. Another issue is that many scenes often felt like they were purposely dragged out, sometimes to bring out emotions and suspense, and sometimes for no reason at all. A lot of the episodes can be pretty much described in 3 sentences or less so it felt kind of boring at times. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation (8/10): I do think season 1 featured much better animation but we got to see some cool animated fight scenes this season as well. A lot of the character movements do look awkward, so I can\u2019t give this category a perfect score either. The Reiss Titan at the end was hilarious though.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10): Okay, I don\u2019t care what people say, but I absolutely love the new op. It\u2019s not intense like the others, but its got this beautiful and haunting and sort of sad melody to it. I also liked the amalee version of it a lot (I\u2019ve listened to it like, 50 times), so I\u2019m just gonna post it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCqV0wtUh1w . The voice acting is as awesome as always, though it\u2019s pretty obvious with Hiroshi on the job.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (7/10): This season focused a lot on building Historia\u2019s character as well as introducing a new character named Kenny, both of which it did a wonderful job at. Following episode 7, Historia becomes a much more believable character as she shows determination and confidence in her decisions. For someone who was known for being one of the weak and naive characters in the series, this is a nice change in her character. Kenny, a cold-hearted killer who is also (spoiler) Levi\u2019s uncle, is another important character in the series. Through him, we get more information about both his and Levi\u2019s past and the persecution of the Ackermans. Some may find him a boring and generic character at first but his characterization goes deeper than that! Due to his tough circumstances, he lived a dark past killing people and desiring power, thinking the only way to succeed is to be on top of someone. His character slowly changes for the better as he befriends Uri Reiss, and learned about compassion and forgiveness. He still to an extent, remained ruthless and cold but as the show progresses, is able to show genuine care for others. This adds to his personality, making him one of the more realistic and interesting characters of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters are basically your typical AoT cast. Levi has more screen time in this season, showcasing his indifferent attitude and badassery. Eren I was sort of disappointed with since his character felt a bit recessive in this season. I liked his personality in the first season but now he\u2019s more of an angsty teenager who is constantly whiny and complaining about who-knows-what. Erwin is as awesome as before, displaying true leadership characteristics and a very calm attitude. The rest of the cast, though, don\u2019t really matter now as they did before. They are still there but now they feel more like plot devices since they do absolutely nothing the whole time. This isn\u2019t a bad thing as the anime is now putting its focus on different characters, and it can\u2019t do that and develop the rest of the cast at the same time, but I wish that Mikasa and Armin could have had more screen time.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10): Overall, this season of Attack on Titan is pretty lit and if you are a fan you should definitely watch it. Although the execution is not always top-notch this show is still amazing and will definitely hit you in the feels and make your heart race with excitement.\\n\\n",

First let me state that AoT is what got me into the anime medium in the first place which may lead to my opinion being biased a little bit, but I probably won\u2019t need to exaggerate on its quality for it already speaks for itself.\r\nSecond, this season was being criticized by many manga readers even before its release for it takes a different directive being mostly about the political situation within the walls and fights among humans themselves instead of against naked titans. This is honestly upsetting becauseof how presumptuous it is and from what I\u2019ve seen so far I can assure you that the thrill remains the same as you\u2019re used to if not better along with the intriguing action any fan of the series would be pleased with.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the titans, even if there isn\u2019t much titan action, because most of what seemed confusing in previous seasons is explained here we will have enough titans in the flashbacks all through. So, if you\u2019ve seen unjustified hate befall this anime, don\u2019t let this bum you out. Watch the PV and feast your eyes upon the action then give the first four, no, first two episodes a try and you will know what I mean.\\n\\n\r\nLastly before I start actually reviewing anything, I just want to state how glad I am to review one of my first favorite series as it airs since it means a lot to me and my career as an anime fan.\\n\\n\r\nNow to the juicy part\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nWe continue from where we left off last season. If you took my advice and watched the PV you would know this season mostly follows Levi and his squad and it starts from there. The scouts have fallen drastically and the political situation just keeps pressuring them more and more that it borderlines abusing them. And so, this season begins with how the scouts face such abuse and try to survive this cruel reality. However, this time their fight is inside the walls and their enemies are fellow human beings.\\n\\n\r\nDespite being so early in the season, so much has already happened and the pace is just what I would expect of this series. Almost certainly this season will be 24 episodes, but as of yet MAL hasn\u2019t updated it for some reason. In either case, we can expect it to have two arcs so if I find anything noteworthy in the second arc or a change of quality I will update this review.\\n\\n\r\nI have mentioned a lot of hate which this anime has received justified by drawbacks found in the manga. However, the creator of AoT has already announced and I quote \u201cHopefully, now that season 3 is being made, I\u2019ll have the chance to wipe away that regret and replace it with something I\u2019m proud of.\u201d So in case you were critical of certain weaknesses you have found in the manga, you have something to look forward to this season.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nSince starting AoT, I have always been astonished by its art ever since the first episode when I got those goosebumps. Art is certainly a major strength of this series and I was afraid it would have fallen out of touch before starting this season. You can imagine my joy when I found out the art is still as beautiful as ever and has actually been polished a step further. The animation is breathtaking and the atmosphere is as bloody as ever with a tiny gap that lets in rays of happiness reflecting in the cast\u2019s tears.\\n\\n\r\nHere is a small fact about me, I am a gore maniac. Thus, seeing the bloodshed, cut skin and ripped out intestines is of outmost importance to my gore-loving self. Luckily enough, AoT doesn\u2019t fall behind in its beautiful display of the aforementioned and, as a matter of fact, this season might be the best so far if you oddly enough share my same interests. Since the titans evaporate after being killed we don\u2019t get a fair display of carnage, but this season seems to shine best in that regard. After so few episodes we have witnessed various colors of torture up to the number of episodes so far, this review is as of episode 6, which should be enough to please you if you are in it for the dark plot.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe most notable thing here is that so far we didn\u2019t have as many screams from Eren as we\u2019ve had in previous seasons. Of course, that is to be expected given this is a more serious arc about political conflicts and struggle for power. The OST is befits the show with the OP and ED being best described as fun while the music during the show goes well with the action providing an ecstasy for any action fan.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development:\\n\r\nI don\u2019t know about you, but Levi is one of my favorites in the series right after Hange and luckily all of the scouts have been getting an adequate amount of character development from the very beginning. We get to see them all from a new perspective because of the new enemy they are facing and how each of them is constantly changing be it for the better or the worse. I have to say, I\u2019m enjoying Levi being a lead for this part and can affirm that if you like Levi, then you are in for a treat.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThis series certainly isn\u2019t for everyone, but if you are among the lucky ones who enjoyed the first two seasons, then shut your ears to all the hate you\u2019ve been hearing and take my word for you will definitely enjoy this season just as much if not more than the previous ones. If you happen to be skeptical of the theme of politics hindering your dose of tantalizing action, I can tell you that the action is more than enough and more amazing than words can describe. The style we are used to is here and is polished up sharper than we have ever seen. I have been having a blast so far this season and I am sure any fan of AoT would say the same.\\n",

            "content": "*THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*\r\nIn my opinion the second season of AOT was mediocre, the first one was mostly empty shock value and sensless action. This season has been boring me to death. It abandons everything form the last season and starts a new subplot that I just don't think is interesting.\r\nStory: \r\nAs I mentioned before the story has shifted into a new direction, now the government is bad and they want to kill Eren. He get's kidnapped for the third time and Historia becomes an edgy brat. It becomes so complicated that the show needs 3 flashbacks per episode just to explain what the hellis going on. It went from a pretty good titans vs humans mistery story to a cliche civil war type story.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are extremly weak, the writer had to add some random superficial character trait's just to make them seem less boring, take Levi for example I can't even consider him a character. He's more like a plot device that's only there to move the story foward by telling the other characters what they need to do, so to make him seem a little more like an actual character the autor aded that he likes cleaning, that's what lazy character writing looks like. And the other characters are the same, the only thing they have is 1 character trait and that's it. Also the development is flat, it's always just a monologue where they talk about stuff that doesn't add anything to the story, they try to stuff emotions down our throats to hide the unpolished story and character development just like Boku no hero academia for example.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and animation: \\n\\n\r\nThe character art retains the same style but removes the thick black outlines that the character's had in the last season. It's good and polished in some places. Im not a big fan of their style but that's subjective. The backrounds however were horrible, they were mostly just a still image behind the characters. It lacked a sense of depth and just felt disconected from the characters. The images themselves were really plain and uncreative. All of it felt like the artist just didn't care, some backrounds had good art but had the same aforementioned problems.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation blew my mind, i don't understand why one of the most popular and mainstream shows of this entire medium has animation so bland that it made me burst out laughing in some scenes. In 11 episodes they had 2 scenes that are well animated. The rest are just people sitting or standing or some horrible slide shows. When they're using the 3d gear it just feels like they're flying in most scenes. Seriously, compared to the last season it feels like a different anime (in a bad way). Also the CG titan was just pathetic, they were changing all the time between 2d and 3d. It was inconsistent and looked really ugly. There were even lip syncing errors, I don't have a problem with these errors if I konw that the anime has a small budget but this is AOT, their's should be huge (thats what she said XD).\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nAll in all it felt lazy. They cut out some battle scenes form the manga and used a lot of cheap tricks to reduce the animation. The story is getting way to complicated for no reason. The character's are becoming even weaker because their develepment fails. I think it's a huge letdown copared to the second season (maybe they should have spent 4 years on this season too). \\n\r\nThe conclusion is: go watch HunterxHunter if you want an intresting show with good action, animation and an excellent story. I really don't get the hype around this train wreck.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "There are no spoilers in this review.\r\nSeason 3 truly shines in its ability to present us with some progress towards the answers we've waited for while fleshing out its cast and lore in an organic way. With its great handle on production quality, characterization and story development, I believe Season 3 elevates AoT from something that could be considered a decent popcorn-flick to something truly memorable in its execution.\r\nBefore I get into the story and characters, I think right off the bat this anime has to be praised for its STELLAR animation and soundtrack. I think WIT's work here rivals that of Ufotable's in someareas, which is saying a lot. The action sequences are extremely well choreographed, and the animation is consistent, crisp and never really dips. The soundtrack also features some of Sawano's best. Don't get me wrong, as I'll discuss below the story and characters are definitely great, but the production value distinguishes Season 3 above most other shows in a fantastic way.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow, the story of AoT has always been intriguing and interesting for the most part. The risk AoT took with Season 3, or the Uprising arc in general, was stepping back from the Titan killing to flesh out the questions we've all had for several arcs. Notice I say 'step back', not 'ignore'. Many people would try to convince you otherwise and say Season 3 only focuses on people, but the fact remains that Titans are still an integral part of this arc and actually have a more interesting purpose than just being killed on screen all the time. This arc perfectly balances three things: giving us answers to questions, fleshing out characters and keeping us engaged in an interesting story with a fantastic pace.\\n\\n\r\nThe first thing: giving us answers to questions. I will say some of the big questions we have about Titans are indeed answered in this arc, and (at least for me) they did not disappoint. I do admit there were times where really big reveals were just casually mentioned, which sometimes made it hard to recognize what is important and what isn't. But as you get deeper into the season (or if you decide to binge watch it in one sitting, which is what I did on my second rewatch with multiple people), you'll find the parts connect rather well. Of course, AoT is great at answering questions but also keeping us in suspense, so be warned: some questions will be answered, but other questions will rise up. \\n\\n\\n\r\nIn Seasons 1 and 2, I thought the characters in the show were...alright. Some were more interesting than others, but overall no one really stuck out. In particular, the intriguing story and world of Aot overshadowed the characters, and I really just watched for the suspense of what happened next in the plot development. I didn't have any interest in the characters or their development. Even though Season 2 made an attempt to flesh out some of the cast, I still found the season too short to make me care fully.\\n\\n\r\nSeason 3 has changed all that. Not only did it manage to add nuance and depth to characters that I thought would stay rather one-note, but it did it in the same time frame as Season 2 and to a larger effect. Characters I didn't even care for in Seasons 1 and 2 are now some of my favorites not just in this show, but perhaps among most shows in general. And not just people in the known cast, but new additions come up that have such life and presence that you can't forget them. It's no exaggeration when I say Season 3 introduces some of the best characters in AoT to date while bringing out the best in the rest of its cast.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow, the pacing of AoT has been something discussed quite alot. I actually found the pacing of AoT's first two seasons pretty well-done already, but Season 3 completely revitalized the formula. Bouts of amazing action are balanced with nice, well-done sections of story development and characterization. Whether you're watching an amazingly animated fight sequence or a backstory about certain characters, you'll never feel like the content is something out-of-place. Each episode manages to pack compelling developments in character and story in perfect capacity. \\n\\n\r\nAs for any flaws in this show, I'd say having watched the show weekly, the first few episodes were somewhat hard to follow because things are happening too fast; while there was stellar action in these episodes, the plot was somewhat loose and it felt like things were being rushed. However, as the show went on, that balance of fast-paced action with slower-paced story development kicked in, and everything started to flow nicely. Also, upon a binge rewatch everything fit quite nicely. And while some characters in this season get immense characterization and development, some (not a lot, but definitely some) still feel sort of dry and bland. However, this is just a small blemish on an otherwise perfect addition to the AoT anime. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Season 3 might be my favorite season of AoT because it manages to deliver on the set up of the first two seasons. The characters have way more depth and nuance to them, the animation is through the roof and the show has shown us its not all about action and suspense, but also about telling us a great story. Although it's sad that AoT won't be coming back til April, as long as WIT can keep up this same level of quality in AoT's production value, I'm not complaining. Season 3 is a game changer for AoT, and I believe it marks the transition of AoT from a decent shounen to a fantastically intricate show.\\n",

Its pace is perfect - nothing is tedious; I couldn't tell that some parts of the manga for this current arc was written while its author was sick. Maybe one factor that did make it obvious the author was sick was the lack of filling plotholes once or twice. \r\nWhatelse is there to talk about season 3? If you're reading this, you've probably watched season 2 and 1, no? Well, Wit studios didn't do any worse than the previous seasons. \\n\\n\r\nSo far SnK is entertaining me because lots of secrets about humanity is becoming revealed, the Scouts are making a huge impact than ever before in impacting human history, and solving the mystery of Eren's key is getting closer.\\n\\n\r\nI never liked SnK's lack of love for its characters! Please have some pity for the characters! They are all dying like bugs! They are human beings - stop killing people. SnK keeps making a depressing atmosphere where there seems to be no hope for the future of humanity unless a brilliant French Revolution is instigated! Nothing about the French Revolution is positive, and it's just dark, just like this anime is.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I love about SnK, though, is that I can connect to the characters in that I, too, am also trapped behind walls, and desire a French Revolution for the future of humanity. The adrenaline this show gives me is amazing and it kept me going when I was working out!",

The story seemed lacking, and the little story that it did tell did not make me optimistic. (I am not a reader of the manga.)\r\nSeason 2 was actually really good and, wow, season 3 is amazing. The story is fast paced, and the anime clearly has the budget and effort to back up its storytelling. It's thrilling around every corner. Every episode is solid, having either brilliantly animated action or interesting plot reveal. (Sometimes an episode has both.)\r\nI'd say the dialogue is a little cringe-inducing and sometimes it relies on cheapertechniques to move the plot along, but I find that these hardly detracted from enjoyment. (Eren's crying after being unchained was not a quality scene at all, but I don't mind it too much.)",

            "content": "From the mysteries of the second season, now the third season takes the reins with political upheaval along with all those mysteries uncovered and still withstanding in the first and second seasons...with varying degrees of success.\r\nShingeki no Kyojin Season 3 is a good continuation from the second season and how this season takes it's direction less from the Titans and more so in the government and the people inside the walls with a political upheaval in the mix of it all.\r\nLA will say like LA said about the second season but Krista or Historia has ALOT of screentime in this season and all the morefor it with how much plot significance and how much of focal point Historia has at the anime at large with Eren tagging along, which oddly enough they have a small but impactful link with one another and this in turn makes them targets for the King, Eren for his Titan powers and Historia for other reasons with Kenny Ackerman on their tail. On talking about character development, the development for most of the characters are spread around sparsely to say the least with little interactions from the main cast to gauge us how or what the characters are feeling or change in personalities, small ones like Jean and his quandary of having to kill people not titans to Erwin's dilemma of the social structure and injustice of the people inside the walls and heck some characters LA wasn't expecting to get character development no matter how small. Historia and Eren getting the spotlight is a given but those little interactions help to say the least especially with such a huge ensemble cast. \\n\\n\r\nSo with the political upheaval, comes into Historia significance of the plot and how this pertains to Eren and to be honest as daft as the plot sounds, it DOES makes sense how they are linked, no thanks to both Historia and Eren's past family failures and ambitions. Though the political upheaval is taken as expected in these kind of plotlines you know \"corrupted\" as per usual, it's more or less HOW they are overthrown with the main cast with their backs to the wall in how they turn everything around which is one of the more better executed moments in this season as anti-climactic and predictable as it was. \\n\\n\r\nWith Shingeki no Kyojin Season 3, there are plot twists as per usual but more so there are SOME form of answers given, like the King and how the government works in a better or should LA say corrupted light, Historia's backstory and how this links with Eren and gives the barking, shouting main protagonist some new light to his character in the process especially with his hatred of Titans and how Historia utterly takes the spotlight once again with her involvement, not to mention how she later pertains to the plot and the changing social structure as a result of the overthrown government.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation once again done by Wit Studio, the animation was consistent and very well detailed right down the awesome fight scenes as sparse as that was in this season with the lesser Titan killing and more human villains of this third season but nonetheless the choregraphy to the planning of the battles as well as the more insane things that occurs in this third season was beautifully and viscerally animated with the consistency to boot, Wit Studio did it again in this front at the very least.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was great and expected with the returning and new characters in the mix with Kazuhiro Yamaji as Kenny as the gruff suave badass Kenny to once again Shiori Mikami flexing her range as Historia even more than ever in this season as well. Yui Ishikawa, Marina Inoue and Yuki Kaji gets decent coverage as their respective roles, though LA felt that Yui Ishikawa as Mikasa got lesser screentime, no thanks in part to Historia getting more focus but nonetheless. Overall voice work was expectedly good for a continuation. \\n\\n\r\nShingeki no Kyojin Season 3 Part 1 was in LA's eyes the more human side of corruption in comparison to looking at the more Titan corruption of the second season, looking more into the societal injustice than the mysteries of the Titans, sure the third season part 1 does have it's mysteries it digs up and answering some, but even then the characters more than anything shows much more of a precedent to this time around and with that, the third season part 1 was a success in LA's eyes, Shingeki no Kyojin took it to another new direction, but was still focused and it executed itself quite well in this regard.\\n\\n\r\nNow there is a second season...of this third season announced (you know much like how Shokugeki no Souma's San no Sara did with theirs), LA saying \"third season part 1\" being quite obvious to this fact, leaving the first part of the third season where the main cast are on their way to the elusive basement..and as much LA hates the entire \"splitting cours\", LA is more than graceful in saying that if Wit Studio need to the time to refine their work, or you know..rest then that's fine by LA, but LA expects the same standards or maybe even surpassing that for this Part 2.",

            "content": "As of the writing of this review, only the Uprising Arc has been shown. I have read the manga, and to be honest this arc was my least favorite, since it was very stretched out and kinda boring. But to my surprise, the anime is the exact opposite! WIT Studio has done an incredible job at translating this slow-paced arc into an amazing, interesting and incredible anime.\r\nStory (8): Even though they sped up this arc, the beginning was still a bit slow. But many great anime suffer from the same problem, so you should never judge an entire anime just on the first few episodes.The quality of the story became better and better after each episode, and it probably won't stop going into the next arc this season.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8): Beautiful art, just as in the previous seasons. The CGI used in this season is actually a lot better than in the previous one (that colossal problem was horrible). But in this season it's quite alright.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9): Man, it has been said a lot, but Hiroyuki Sawano is like the Hans Zimmer of anime. Every single anime he worked on has a soundtrack beyond amazing. \\n\r\nAlthough most people don't like the opening and say 'the ending and opening should be switched', I actually really like the opening. But yes, the ending is way better, but the opening is great too, don't be so butthurt.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9): Levi and Mikasa are just as bad-ass as ever and still remain to be my favorite characters. Although now, we're introduced to Kenny the Ripper, someone who can compete with them on my favorite character list. I don't know why, but I'm just a sucker for bad-ass killing machines. \\n\r\nAnd I guess Eren and the rest are there too...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10): Even though the beginning was a bit slow, this arc is definetaly one of my favorties. From such a slow and boring manga arc to this incredible anime arc. Just goes to show how well WIT Studio is handling this series. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (10): There is not much to complain about this season. I enjoyed it all the way up until now and I will continue to enjoy it for the remaining episodes. I honestly can't wait to see the next arc animated!!",

            "content": "5s Across the board.... For F--k Sake...\r\nThe only scene I liked was the last scene after the credits and even then, it still had no payoff, just like most of this season. Its like hey, you wanna see cool shit? Alright! Wait until next season to see that cool shit! Cause all you get now is build up for it!\r\nStory -- 5;\r\nWith nothing but politics this entire third season and for some reason fannys, and I don't use that term lightly, thinking its great for reasons unknown. Simple things amuse simple minds I suppose. Which is why attack on titan gets rated so high yetis shit!\\n\\n\r\nI won't use that word again because I don't judge people for the shows they like, I believe you're allowed to like whatever the hell you want and fuck peoples opinions, they don't matter not even mine. \\n\\n\r\nBut heres my thoughts anyways, so the politics could be good, but all it is is random talk, its actually just a big facade of people in power doing bad things because yeah, thats always original, who would of thought the people in charge would be bad guys??? Most of the conversations in this entire show are literally nothing more then saying lets go fight this and then talking about plans on how to fight them and what to do and then when they get to fight its either a minute and over or a 5 second montage of action scenes that amount to nothing.\\n\\n\r\nThere was no fun, no thriller, nothing interesting, almost everything we learned about the titans was meaningless, yet it did advance the plot but you don't care because it ruins old plotlines they created, I actually gave the first season a 9 for the action and ideas alone, the choreography was stunning and even though the characters weren't that likable and a bit one dimensional there was still enough twists and turns to keep it well.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are reading this, you've probably seen the other two seasons, season 2 I didn't give a 9 I gave a 3, so hey at least season 3 gets a 5. Because it didn't have a shitty titan reveal or worthless dialogue, and it didn't feel like 12 episodes of complete shiste & nothingness.\\n\\n\r\nBoth seasons had horrible dialogue and horrible action, the only thing that gives season 3 the two extra brownie points is the fact that the story actually went somewhere this time. Except you still ruined attack on titan...\\n\\n\r\nIn season two we forget about the final scene that shows titans in walls and then spend 12 episodes talking and fighting and making it known others can be titans & after introducing these new titans and these new factions, they all get to be ignored this season. Making two pretty much again, useless... .... ...\\n\\n\r\nThis season they address the titans by making it known --- --- (Spoiler Alert) --- --- That there is magical blood lines that created the titans, and that the king was controlling the country with titans using a titan that can remove peoples memorys and that we can give titan blood and create titans whenever we want because yeah yeah yeah yeah drama drama drama drama. Not to mention that the Arthur trys to say well the reason no one knows we make the titans and control the kingdom were already in control of is because some special bloodlines are immune to the mind eraser titan because that makes sense to. Its all magic, everything real about the show just got turned in magic and thats the explanation but yet your combining magic with science and needles and steampunk ODM gear. Alright yeah that makes attack on titan more epic then it was before. \\n\r\nAt least when you though the titans were science based or some form of nature it made the crystal hardening and the abnormal titans even more interesting but now its just a magic roll of the dice titan tv show that I hate. What a shitty choice to make.\\n\r\n--- --- --- (END OF THE SPOILER ALERT) --- --- ---\\n\\n\r\nYou just spent an entire season saying you dont know where titans came from, this is the fight against them there is an outside titan force introduced in season 2, yet season 3 is just meandering about titans inside the walls, so now its everyone vs everyone and we don't know who to trust and before we know it doors and trees and animals will be titans next and there will be the sun and the moon titan and what the fuck ever.... I made that up about the doors and trees titans but at this rate I wouldn't be surprised if the Arthur thought that was super duper creative and did it anyways.\\n\r\nI accepted the abnormal titans but come on, this is ridicules let alone the origins I refuse to mention here because I just did above in that spoiler sentence so read it there if you'd like. But the origins story, actually ruins the realistic tension of titans being a threat. And really puts a shit ton of loopholes in the story on how the hell that origin story works. Which the Arthur trys to explain with more loops holes mentioned once again in the spoiler above.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters; -- 3\\n\r\nWell Eren isn't just screaming and yelling like he was in season 2, but is he back to season 1? No... Season 1 all he wanted to do was kill titans, thats cool thats acceptable, season 2 he yells and is pissed he isn't in control and is a hostage and that entire season was just worthless drama let alone the 2 titan reveals that were total shit,\\n\\n\r\nSeason 3 Eren at least talks and discusses things, but do we get any character development? No... I remember nothing that eren said that mattered, none of the politics discussed mattered, honestly eren was just in chains and a hostage again for 3-4 episodes but at least it wasn't the entire season like the 2nd.\\n\\n\r\nMikasa is still obsessed with eren like always and will defend him like always, we have this new gal historia but she isn't really important in the second half besides for like 2 episodes and as a love interest for Erens new found harem storyline starting to take root.\\n\\n\r\nWe get a bunch of old characters back and are supposed badass Eli or whatever his name is, (I remember he is Levi) But because he did nothing in season 2 but clean house I didn't care, but now in season three none of them really do anything important. Levis squad is completely gone its pretty much him and Eren and some others you won't remember. & Levi being super dramatic and staring with spooky dark shadows under his eyes and his hand outstretched dramatically....\\n\r\nLike hes about to go Kalii maaa Kali maaa Kalii maa and take his heart like some shit out of indiana jones.\\n\\n\r\nWe did however have one thing that mattered, and that was new badass guys with guns that shoot large spikes, because when your trapped inside walls and metal is scarce you want to use more rare materials then you would ever need because yeah bullets wont do.\\n\\n\r\nThey can also swing from the ceiling with them like spider man except with guns, and they don't even need the odm gear super narly dude narlastic dude. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation//art//sounds - 5\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, they don't even take the time to animate that well anymore except for like 1 or 2 episodes most of the time its just them swinging through the air endlessly on the same animated track, it is in no way as dynamic as the first season. It actually reminds me of the horribly animated and reused scenes of naruto when they jump tree to tree and talk for 20 minutes. Yeah this is what Attack on titan is coming to.\\n\\n\r\nWhy do I compare it to the first? Because it seems like the writers & Arthur and directors, all said, well we made a successful first season, now the fans are hooked line and sinker, so lets just do shit from now on and what we come up it doesn't matter they will buy it no matter what because they think its so cool, and it kind of worked it just seems that the backlash of the extreme lameness of season 2 got such a hate filled rage that season 3 they made the show juuuuuust aaaaa litttttleeeee better! Ya know. Like just enough to wet the fans garments.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment --- 5\\n\r\nI enjoyed some of the ideas, but the first 2 episodes and then episode 8-11 are like the only things you need to watch.\\n\r\nEverything else is a complete waste of time,, there might be something between episodes 3-7 but for me there wasn't Besides all of that new titan stuff that I guess won't be being put to use until the second cour, even though the titan stuff was the only good thing.\\n\\n\r\nBut even with those few highlights, the way they are done is just so boring and pathetic... I rolled my eyes at every reveal, I had to force myself to listen to the dialogue even though nothing anyone said this season mattered, Except for the few flashbacks that linked a few characters together but they once again were never used.\\n\\n\r\nOverall --- 5 \\n\\n\r\nOver all I found that most of the \"\"\"Powers\"\"\" you see this season, could have never been added, season 2 shouldn't of existed either, what makes me so upset with what has happened with this show is this.\\n\\n\r\nI accepted the titans, I accepted the ODM gear because it was animated well the first season, & I went as far as to accept Eren turning into a titan because his scientist dad did it.\\n\\n\r\nWhat ruins is, is that you took a show that had fantasy and realism, and then shit on the realism side that made it fun the first season and went full on fantasy, all of the gore and drama that made it fun is now melodrama,\\n\\n\r\nBy that I mean, its so watered down that its like teen age drama that you just roll your eyes at, relationship issues, and I mean It makes attack on titan feel like a slice of life and then you add action scenes that are badly done whilst trying to make it serious???\\n\\n\r\nI mean that is the formula, you just tried to make people care about a show, without giving them anything to care about.\\n\\n\r\nLet alone the new storylines you added, just put every other storyline out the window.\\n\r\nEren trying to go and fight and take revenge is no longer a thing its like he could care less now.\\n\r\nMikasa being important, nope shes a prop device and tsundere for Eren now.\\n\r\nThe bad Levi, I called him Eli at some point in here, I apologize, is now useless, he twists peoples arms and says edgy shit to sound cool. \\n\r\nNone of the fights are thought out, a lot of people say how can you not love the action, if you watch the first season and the amount of thought that goes into choreography surpasses all of these for example the Levi squad tearing down Ani, ana, whatever that gal titan was, whenever she was a titan, you can see they cut her tendons her eyes they destructed her, it was thought out and planned and that made it cool.\\n\\n\r\nNothing this season has any thought, not the story, the action or the dialogue and barely any thought to its own characters, its just edgy to be edgy and you get promised action not only the build up but long talks about it and then never get the reward.\\n\\n\r\nFINAL THOUGHTS.....\\n\r\nThey say, you cannot have your cake and eat it to, but in this case, there isn't even any cake to look at, the cake was a lie, there was and never will be any. Attack on titan is now just one big lie, that never stops promising something it will never give, and thats good action along with a good story together again, they gave up, just like I did on this show\\n\\n\r\nI'll still watch the second cour because everyone said thats when attack on titan feels like the first season again, but ya know, heres hoping thats true, we can only wait and see.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading & later my dudes & later my loves! - GodOfWolves...",

            "content": "\u00a0Given the nature of today's media consumption, rarely does anything 'stick' unless constant updates are provided to keep out attention.\u00a0 Wit Studio's faltering in releasing the second season of AoT has resulted in the series's current lack of attention, which is a shame because it's only gotten better since its first season.\u00a0\u00a0\r\nStory:\r\nOur story continues in humanity's fight against the titans, bringing us back within the walls of Shingeki no Kyojin (or Attack on Titan, I just prefer the Japanese titles) where instead of a mass slaughter/operation to fight the brainless naked people, we're given character moments, backstories, lore dumps, a lot of exposition, more loredumps, dear god how many lore dumps are there?!\\n\\n\r\nHarking back to the kind of tone that was established in Season 2, a lot of what Season 3 has to offer comes to expanding the cramped world of SNK outward by giving us an astronomical amount of lore and related content that gives a few answers and many, many questions which lead to said answers.\u00a0 A lot of the focus this time is centered around Historia, who got a major upgrade from her role as the background 'cute girl' that she was established in way back in Season 1, expanding her role as a character and the significance she holds after the events in Season 2.\u00a0 This, combined with a lot of retrospective moments that make the struggle of sustaining a population with limited space really helps set the alarming and desperate situation that the characters are in and gives a lot of motive as to why the Scouts give a damn to 'take back Wall Maria', as they've been saying for basically three seasons by this point.\\n\\n\r\nWhile a nice (and beneficial) change of tone is good and all, the problem with the way this is presented is simply by how much of it there is.\u00a0 Factors like explaining the royal family, who Historia is, facts about Eren's dad, the origin story of Eren's dad, introducing an entirely new character who serves as an extension of Levi, bringing back an old face that appeared for like three episodes in Season 1, the list can goes on and on.\u00a0 This overload of information makes it extremely difficult to pace out correctly and ended up making the series disjointed and clunky in its presentation because all kinds of different information was being presented, especially in the latter half of the series where we get several episodes which were one-off episode backstories.\u00a0 The information is good and helpful, but the place for them was certainly less than ideal.\\n\\n\r\nThere's also the issue of Wit Studio saying they're 'taking a break' and split the originally 2-cour season into season part one and two.\u00a0 (J.C. Staff, don't you laugh, you're guilty of this too.\u00a0 You too Diomedia.)\u00a0 It's one of those emerging practices that I'm not a fan of.\u00a0 Yes, studios need a break and a bigger time window so the animators can breathe a little bit, but the place that they ended on was such a big hype moment with a massive cliffhanger that it's infuriating as the audience to have to wait several seasons before it can be released.\u00a0 Especially when the last few episodes of the 'season' just sort of meander without any real point to it since they can't go farther risking an unsatisfactory stopping point.\u00a0 That's one of the major reasons you lost a lot of viewership and attention here in the west after all, Wit.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Good tonal shift\\n\r\n+ Lots of worldbuilding and character moments\\n\r\n-\u00a0 Too much of it was jam packed together\\n\r\n-\u00a0 Ended right when things were getting fucking good.\u00a0 (You're blueballin' us here.\u00a0 And not in the good way.)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nOn the note of characters, the theme with SNK seems to be \"Do everyone but the main characters\".\u00a0 While Eren certainly didn't get the spotlight in Season 2 which was a nice breath of fresh air from his teenage vengeance boner, him being a more important part of Season 3 yet not really getting anything to himself aside from moments of reflection add, but don't do his character any favor.\u00a0 He broods around so much that he does indeed seem he's growing, but does it so much that it kinda gets annoying.\u00a0 A shame too considering a lot of his reflection does his character a lot of good.\u00a0 I just wish it was done more subtly and wasn't so frequent.\\n\\n\r\nHistoria on the other hand gets so much attention that she might as well be the main character this time around.\u00a0 The entire season is centered around her character and her family history, which ties into the overall lore of the series.\u00a0 What we see is a dramatic growth in character that builds her from the meek and shy girl she was before to one worthy to pay heed to.\u00a0 It's good growth that catalyzes a lot of organic action and motive, and was definitely one of the highlight moments of the season.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, much can't be said for the rest of the cast.\u00a0 Levi gets his own mini area to himself, but it's not nearly as developed as Historia and feels sloppily made cause it's not HIS backstory; he's just part of it.\u00a0 (That and the setting for it comes outta nowhere.\u00a0 We were literally never told that there's an 'underground' before.)\u00a0 Armin and Mikasa are even worse off.\u00a0 They don't really do anything aside from move where the plot demands them be.\u00a0 Even if they're pushed to the side, they're still protagonists, and should facilitate the plot in some way, but they don't.\u00a0 The same could be said for any of the remaining scouts, where Jean just serves as a character foil to Eren and having a split relationship with Marco, and miscellaneous characters/cannon fodder who by this point you really shouldn't care about cause their impact quite literally lasts for 10 minutes at most.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Historia's growth\\n\r\n+/- Eren's self reflection\\n\r\n-\u00a0 Everyone else kinda meanders\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nIt's been 5 years since the release of the first season, and Wit has drastically reduced the thickness of the black outline of the characters.\u00a0 The art is essentially the same, but higher quality, with some very nice choice animation sequences that stand out amazingly.\u00a0 The introduction of new areas also aid to make the world a lot prettier as their involvement expand the world and provide the animators something new to draw instead of fields and buildings.\u00a0\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nThe usage of CGI is also pretty prevalent this time but doesn't stand out due to the series using it sparingly and only during wide or distance shots, which look amazing when they happen.\u00a0 It's rare that I see CGI usage not bog down the show, so this is a case where I have to give Wit congratulations on a job well done.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nLike the tonal shift, the music we get is a lot more somber and isn't so high energy and firing at all cylinders like previous seasons.\u00a0 \"Red Swan\" by X JAPAN and HYDE is more focused on the vocals and has a smoother sound to it.\u00a0 Using a lot of piano and a lot less repetition like its OP predecessors, this song sticks out to me not only for that fact, but just how much it ties into the season with its themes of self reflection and perspective.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nSimilarly, \"Akatsuki no Requiem\" by Linked Horizon is kinda like a less intense version of Season 2's 'Sasageyo', being more focused on having a smoother sound and sounding more like something you'd hear sung by a choir than a battle cry.\u00a0 Again, it's one of those changes that I'm a fan of, expanding the potential of the series and the apparently complicated lore that it has.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nThe 'Shonen' genre has had three ages up till this point.\u00a0 The first age was the Big 3: Naruto, Bleach, and One Piece dominating the space with HunterxHunter lagging behind with a somewhat smaller but strong base behind it.\u00a0 The second age expanded with an explosion of popularity in the west: SAO and SNK being the forefront of that movement, both of which sitting mostly in memoriam but still have an existing following behind them.\u00a0 Currently we sit in the third age with Black Clover and especially Boku no Hero Academia, but we're focusing mostly on the second age here.\\n\\n\r\nHaving followed the adaptation since the birth of the 'second age', I found Season 3 to be not as strong as Season 2 in terms of execution, and sort of as an equivalent to Season 1 if Season 1 focused more on trying to build the world instead of insane violence against both humans and titans alike.\u00a0 It's still a positive change however, and gives the show a stronger footing in the overall story it's trying to present, even if the lore delivery was pretty messy getting towards the end.\u00a0 Had the season not been split into two, I feel like it could've done a lot better overall since easy lead-ins would benefit the story more instead of NEEDING to end on a massive cliffhanger in order to keep people interested (which for the most part only angers your audience) and I would have more time to catch up instead of marathoning a fourth of the series in one sitting.\u00a0\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nIf you want more SNK, watch it.\u00a0 Honestly I'd vouch for this series to be seen by more people because it's good, but hardly anyone cares about it because the landscape of anime is extremely unforgiving due to the seasonal schedules and the consumer's need to consume things and quickly forget them once the season's over.\u00a0 It's a shame that Wit only found their footing to easily release more episodes of the series three years after the hype had truly died down, but for what it's worth, it's much easier to get into the series without fanatics memeing the fuck out of it so you can actually sit down and enjoy the goddamn thing without interruptions.\u00a0 It's nice, if not a bit tragic.",

            "content": "Just as a heads up, I haven't read the manga, so I'm writing this review while only knowing what we've seen in the anime. So, I'm not the biggest fan of Attack on Titan. I can't deny that it's storytelling and visuals are remarkable, but it's never really been my thing. \r\nThis season, that changed. Why it changed, I couldn't tell you, but something about this season really got me excited for the future of the story. This season is very much a Levi season. While the story still focused a bit on Eren and his backstory, really, season three of Attack on Titan wascentered around Levi. You'll get an episode on Levi's origins, and you'll also get to meet Kenny, someone that's tied deeply to Levi's past. I think this slight shift away from Eren helped rejuvenate my interest in the series.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, this season will also give some long awaited answers to Eren's family, namely his father. Not only will you get backstory on how he met Eren's mother and what life was like for the two of them inside the walls, you'll learn who Eren's father was before he entered the walls. Not to mention, this season finally sets up what exactly is in the basement of the Jaeger house. Or this half of the season, I should say. \\n\\n\r\nBoth Levi and Eren's history are very, very excited new pieces to the story as well as Historia's history. The overall pacing of this half of the season was done very well as the proper sections of story dropped when they should've while still having the proper down moments.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, I have to brag on the visuals because they get better every season. A new Titan is introduced in this season, and the look of it is insanely cool. There are also brilliantly done environments that I love.\\n\\n\r\nAttack on Titan still isn't entirely in my wheelhouse, but if it is for you, I think this season will impress you more than any others. The teaser for next year's content was very intriguing as well, so at the very least, my interest is still very much peaked for 2019. Here's to more!",

Its one of the very few currently airing series that I can watch without constant facepalms (like Steins Gate 0 or Boruto) and cant wait for the next episode even if I know exactly what will happen. \r\nArt / Animation 9/10 - well, not much to say here. Its joy to watch and one can pray other series (cough, DBS, cough) were looking THAT good.\r\nSound 7/10 - overall soundtrack is good and keep up with visual side, however openning is dull compared to amazing highenergy ones from 1st and 2nd season. It's a dark, brutal series with tons of fast paced action, not a slice of life.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10 - one of the best shounens in decades, which I can safely recommend everyone. Captivating plot, great characters, beautiful art - jsut watch it!",

The action is always entertaining, music is always hype, animation is always amazing besides maybe a facial expression every now and then, same old characters that I love plus development for them and new ones, and I like that we are getting more knowledge about the world and titans finally plus some rebelling against the government stuff which is cool. It differs a bit from the manga so far as the creator wanted to change some things and ifyou are a anime only and even have read the manga its still great and the changes don't take away from anything unless you want everything from the manga to be in the anime (which is never gonna happen for any anime really because of budget and just not being all that important really) but even if you are that nit picky its still a great show and to me its one of my favorites.",

Let me start by saying that this is the most overrated anime of all time. Season one was good, season 2 was ok, but season 3 was just...words can't even describe how bad it was. Because of all the hype I decided to watch Attack on Titan, after watching season 1 I really liked the show but it eventually started to feel like your average everyday anime. Mc has some awesome power, gets mad and exposes it to everyone, andsome basic side characters. I was really debating if I should continue watching Aot after the major disappointment that I felt in season 2 with the plot getting absolutely nowhere and barely any character development. I can't believe I sat through 12 more episodes of this mediocre anime. I would not recommend this anime and I don't think I will watch season 4. For that reason I give Attack on Titan a 5. (that's being generous)",

            "content": "Attack On Titan's third season is the most impressive instalment so far - a surprising merit considering it has the least amount of actual titans. AOT proves here that it does not need to rely heavily on its premise to deliver a compelling narrative. While the traumatic first eight episodes of Season 1 remain the best collection, Season 3 manages to mostly overcome the struggles of pacing that its prequels fall victim to - like so many shonen - and takes large steps forward in character development.\r\nWhile the first episode of this season put me off with the sudden introduction of Kenny, his involvement isso well executed that it's impossible to count it against the season. Political intrigue and the criminal underworld are not at all what one learns to expect from AOT, but the pacing and volume of exposition are carefully used to keep you guessing all the way through. This is especially refreshing after the previous season, where the viewer was made aware of the origin of the latest titan incursion far too early, and subsequently forced to watch the characters play catch up for a few gruelling episodes.\\n\\n\r\nAlmost equally refreshing is the huge drop in screen time given to Eren. This is probably much more personal than anything, but I find Eren to be one of the weakest characters in the series. His story is fleshed out enough, but it is used only as a justification for his one-dimensionality rather than a driving force behind complex emotions or motivations beyond \"must kill all titans.\" I'm not a fan of shonen anime in general, and so I personally find anything reminiscent of angry revenge-bent fighting men yelling back and forth for episodes at a time a bit jarring. Mercifully, Eren finds himself incapacitated for the majority of this season, giving room for the impressive cast of side characters that AOT has masterfully developed to shine.\\n\\n\r\nPacing is still a slight issue towards the end of the season, and the arc does feel a bit detached from the grander narrative of humanity vs titans. I can see this being an issue for some viewers, but I felt that enough exposition was offered to offset these issues once on the other end. By becoming more grounded in people and politics, Season 3 sets a different standard of verisimilitude. This is shaken only by the drunken puppet king seeming a bit offensively lowbrow, references to Kenny massacring the military police, and Eren seeming surprisingly unshaken (other than his immediate reaction) by the huge revelations about his father. I'm not too familiar with the changes to the animation team for this season, but it does feel like the visual quality has dropped slightly compared to its predecessors. In contrast, the opening theme for this season is especially beautiful - both the visuals and song.\\n\\n\r\nSeason 3 gives considerable effort towards developing more characters such as Levi, Erwin, Historia, and more. Giving us glimpses of their younger selves, even in the opening theme, and further explaining their motivations and flaws goes a long way towards humanising them, something most peers of AOT within its genre neglect.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it almost feels as though some subplots of Season 3 were designed to be filler, offering slightly less consequential answers while setting up for its second part. Whatever their intentions, these arcs are executed well enough that they secure Season 3's stealing of the spotlight. Almost paradoxically, this season is the most ambitious leap so far by not utilising the external pure titan threat, which is the centrepiece of its ambitious premise. As this first part of the season ends with the resumption of the overarching narrative, I hope that the strides made here in repairing previous shortcomings continue.",

The characters are generic at this point, you can pick any shonen anime character atthis point and plug him in and you'll get the same result. there is no depth left.",

            "content": "As the third season of Attack on Titan has ended earlier than expected, we can look back to a very solid season. As the opening indicates this season focuses more on characters and story than the action of humans vs titans, like the previous two seasons did.\r\nLike the previous two seasons the animation and sound quality is very well done. The animation quality is somewhat worse than season 1 though, because some of the things in the anime are replaced by CGI, which doesn't really fit with the rest of the animation. The sound is still very well done using older music from the franchise,changing some a bit and putting some new OST in the mix as well. The opening theme song is somewhat worse than the previous seasons in my opinion, being more serene, although it fits this arc better as the opening, like this arc focuses on the characters and not on fighting the titans like the previous two seasons did.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Attack on Titan season 3 is somewhat more complex than its predecessors, as it focuses on themes like character relationships, character backstories and power and corruption in the government of humanity. There is also still a lot of mystery within the series, which is mostly seen in character backstories this seasons. As more events are explained, other questions come up in place of them. Combining this with leaving cliffhangers at the end of every episode leaves the viewer wanting to watch more. This season also seems to set up very well for the next arc of the season.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the parts season 3 has focused most upon is the character backstories, relationships and development. The most prominent characters focused on in this season are Levi, Erwin, Historia and the new addition to the cast Kenny. As shown in the promotional video Levi and Kenny already know each other, with their relationship and respective backstories being a pretty important part of the season. As it was revealed in the second season that Krista's real name was Historia, this season expends on that revealing Historia's backstory. This actually becomes an important plot point with a lot of mystery surrounding her family. Lastly Erwin is an important character this season, as he comes up with several plans for the scouts, has a part of his backstory revealed as well and wishes to realize his ideals for humanity. Overall the characters were very well handled this season.\\n\\n\r\nLike the previous two seasons this season was a very enjoyable experience for me as well. Multiple backstories of characters were revealed, characters were more developed and at a certain point in the season the scouts and part of the military had a very well thought plan against the current government, which was very enjoyable to see unfold as well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I would give all the previous categories I talked about (story, art/animation, sound, characters and enjoyment) an 8/10 as this was a very solid installation in the franchise in my opinion. I would like to see this trend continuing in the next season as well or even improving further upon it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "This season\u2019s, by far, my favourite. It gave me everything I dreamed of and served it on a golden platter with Levi\u2019s face engraved on it. \r\nIn a nutshell, I wasn\u2019t expecting AOT to develop in this way, but I am so glad it\u2019s taken the route of exploring characters, politics, backstories,... I couldn\u2019t ask for more. \r\nDon\u2019t worry, it still features some of the classics:\r\n-Misaka\u2019s only emotion and vocabulary being \u201cEren\u201d\r\n-Levi being Levi but better\r\n-Eren kidnapped and literally not being around for \u00be of the anime\r\n-Sasha\u2019s ears being a gift from God\r\n-Scout regiment releasing titans like mixtapes\r\nBut, we're also introduced to some new things:\r\n-KENNYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY\r\n-babyskeleton Levi\\n\r\n-Levi\u2019s smile (I shit you not. I cried. It\u2019s the most beautiful thing ever. RIP moi)\\n\r\n-Eren not hollering\\n\r\n-Eren\u2019s back muscles (thank me later)\\n\r\n-The return of Pyxis, Zachary and the government (all of which slayed life itself)\\n\r\n-Historia/Christa\u2019s woke-ness\\n\\n\r\nYes, yes, I know, there\u2019s not as much Titan-fighting as season 1 and 2, in fact, there\u2019s only one real titan fight, but shut up and let me explain.\\n\r\nSeason 3\u2019s much slower than the previous two and that\u2019s what makes it perfect. The pacing allows for so much world-building, character development and for the plot to progress well without it becoming boring. As much as I love season 1 and 2, they\u2019re both primarily focused on fighting and just getting on with the action, which is nice and all, but it couldn\u2019t go on forever, without the anime becoming a mess. In a story like this one, the politics and character developments are what makes it have that substance that sets AOT apart from other shounen. \\n\r\nIt\u2019s really this season that\u2019ll get you thinking, really connect you to the characters and tie a lot of loose ends. So, all the talking that happens in this season\u2019s important! Without it, you wouldn\u2019t be able to learn about the Reiss Family, Grisha Yaeger, Levi\u2019s background and much, much more. \\n\\n\r\nThat said, I don\u2019t see why people have a problem with the fight scenes, this season. I thought they were amazing! The way in which they\u2019re planned out and executed is just *heart- face emojis*. \\n\r\nThe talent of the scout regiment has never shone through any better. Whether it was rescuing Eren or rescuing Eren, Armin and Hange are geniuses who have to power to destroy the world and I can\u2019t believe I had to wait this long to see their plans in action because It\u2019s phenomenal.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve seen some comments going around, complaining about how much of an annoying child Eren\u2019s become. He went from being this \u201cyell at all\u201d to \u201ccry at all\u201d in what seemed like one episode and that\u2019s apparently triggering. I agree, but I also disagree. Yes he does act like a child, but that's becuase he is a child! 16 is not old. Yes, he does get real whiny, but that\u2019s nothing new. What\u2019s new, though, is Eren\u2019s self- awareness. Character development. Finally. In the early seasons, Eren\u2019s portrayed as the typical shounen protagonist: driven, strong, screams a lot. Now, however, he\u2019s beginning to be fleshed out, characterised as more than just a defeater- of- titans.\\n\r\nAnd he\u2019s not the only one. Historia, as well as a couple of other characters, have minor but very impactful character development and it\u2019s honestly the highlight of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nOn another note, I swear to god Eren\u2019s eyes have changed colour. They used to be green and now they\u2019re this blue, but sometimes kind of green?! Explanations, please?\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s only one thing. One thing that disappointed me. Out of the entire anime, they had to get this one thing wrong: that opening song. It was so underwhelming. At the beginning of episode one, I was ready to stand up, do the salute and cry my eyeballs out, but all I got was this pretty song that still made me cry my eyeballs out. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the theme itself is still amazing, but the song\u2019s just ugh-meh. \\n\r\nThe ending song\u2019s dope, though! Still, they better step it up next season because this opening theme\u2019s not up to their usual standards.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow, a couple of notes on the ending. [SPOILERS START HERE]\\n\\n\r\nThat last episode had me excited and terrified, at the same time. Excited because ohmylord they\u2019re going to get wall Maria back. But terrified because ohmylord they\u2019re either going to fail miserably or succeed with only one-third of the scout regiment.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s absolute genius what the producers did with the final ending theme: I mean, I didn\u2019t understand shit of what was going on, but I think we all know who's going to die\u2026.dammit Erwin, I was actually starting to like him.\\n\\n\r\nUntil episode 4, I had completely forgotten about Annie\u2019s existence. I know that she\u2019s trapped in a cave somewhere, but is she still there? It\u2019s interesting that they chose to mention her\u2026\\n\\n\r\nGrisha Yaeger and Kenny Ackerman both confuse the hell out of me. I don\u2019t know what to think of Kenny. Was he really that Bad? And Grisha, I\u2019m starting to doubt that he\u2019s dead.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 10\u2019s my favourite episode of the entire anime, so far. It made my soul happy.\\n",

Time skips. There seems to be some relatively important stuff being passed over, obviously so they can fit enough material into the 12 episode anime block (don't know if they flesh it out in the manga but I imagine they do) but it still gives you that longing to figure out what you missed. Other than that its the same beautiful art, dynamic characters, amazing fighting scenes, and godtier music. I'm goingto put up a 9, even thought its like a 9.7, just because saying its 10 wouldn't be justified.",

I bet a lot of people are disappointed, but hey, I'm going to Disney in a week so if it weren't for this I'd be missing a couple of episodes lol! So I might as well write a review...\r\nArt and Sound- Same Ol' 9/10: Despite how WIT should be grasping at straws production-wise, this actually looks and feels like the best season so far (although second cour could prove that wrong). Also a lot of the best animations this show has offered thus far are present here.\r\nThe voice acting is the same. Since there's more characterdevelopment this time around, Eren isn't a screamy brat. \\n\\n\r\nThe new opening is a really nice contrast to the previous openings. Song-wise, I still find Sasageyou to be the best, but as far as the theme of the visuals in the opening, Red Swan takes the cake!\\n\\n\r\nStory- 8/10: This season adapts mangaka Isayama's least favorite part of the manga... I don't know what it's officially called, but it is notorious for the large lack of Titans and the focus on conspiracies and politics.. I personally never felt it to be a problem in the manga, but whatever went wrong had to be amended here. \\n\\n\r\nI don't have good enough memory to notice any differences, but this version is pretty solid regardless. Most people probably hated it solely because of the lack of Titans.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- 9/10: Without Titans messing things up, this is an opportune moment for the people we've been spending the last two seasons with to... well... talk. \\n\\n\r\nWe get a lot of great new characterization from pretty much everybody as they have to start fighting their battles within the walls instead of outside of them. \\n\\n\r\nI can't say anything else because of spoilers, however, so I'll just end this portion of the review in this very anti-climactic manner.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall- 8/10: I've given every season of this show 8s across the board, but tbh this season is set up to be my favorite season so far.\\n\\n\r\nNow let us all wait until spring 2019 for them to ruin everything!\\n\\n\r\nAlso, WIT you freakin' trolls with that sneak preview of next cour at the end (if it's the scene from the manga I think it is...)! I mean, it's not as bad as season 1's \"Oh! Wall Titan!\" *waits 4 years*, but still holy crap!!!\\n\\n\r\n'Kay review over now.\\n\\n\\n\r\nKEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEENNNNNNNNNNNNYYYYYY!

            "content": "Ah yes. I, ANIME_FFS, am writing another review. After around 6 months, (and several days of procrastination), I have come back with an AOT review. Yes, I should have reviewed the first two seasons first but I didn't bother to type something about it. This season, though, made me love AOT way more and I shall enlighten you about this anime\r\nStory - 9\r\nAOT Season 3 finally arrives only to spread the sad news that it's sibling was lost in the earthquake of April 2019. Nonetheless, Part 1 delivers an amazing story continuation and here we are, dancing on it's fingertips and begging for more.This time, the story doesn't focus on the titans but much more on the question that has been right in front of our eyes; who is Levi and what is his background? Needless to say, this season informs us well about Levi, his past and a new character-Kenny Ackermann. Is he connected to Mikasa? Maybe. Maybe not. Who knows? More context on Erwin's actual desire to join the Scouts and a MAJOR plot twist in the story takes place. Would've absolutely loved to give a 10 but I really hate cliffhangers.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10\\n\r\nWit delivers the same, amazing visual again! The gorgeous animations and beautifully displayed artwork never fails to amaze me. My most favourite artwork in the entirety of the season (heck even in the anime!) is the opening. I don't understand why it's getting unnecessary hatred. It's my favourite opening overall because of the deeper meaning behind this season. It wonderfully displays the very basic roots of our much awaited 12 episodes and it is truly amazing. The Levi holding a dagger whille staring at Kenny, the wonderous trio as adorable children just having innocent fun, Erwin with his father and even Historia! I. Simply. Loved. It.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8 \\n\r\nRed Swan is really^\u221e GOOOOOOOD! Pair that up with a heartwarming and very well-made opening art, praised in the Art segment, and you amplify the feeling (if you already love this anime). I didn't like the ending as much as the opening because it kind of reminded me of the creepy music in seasons 1 and 2. The voice acting in this anime, heck in the entire franchise, is really on-point with the expressions and you can feel the chaos in shaken voices as well the frenemy banter between Eren and Jean. Again, really love the opening!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 9\\n\r\nWe see a relatively huge amount of character development in this season as Eren, not only doesn't get abducted a second time, but now has become a calm and collected being. He does have an existential crisis moment but snaps out of it pretty quickly. Historia goes from the innocent, kind and inarguably cute person to a woman of change, with a very good sense of duty and leadership. Other characters like Jean and Armin develop pretty well too, with Armin becoming more responsible and mature while Jean too exhibits such change. Mikasa doesn't change much but Connie and Sasha become much better friends, it seems; almost as if they're siblings.(not a spoiler dw)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\r\nI absolutely loved this season! There was something to it that made me enjoy this more than the other seasons. I think it's because in this season, they don't introduce new questions and answers quite a few of them. I also really like the U-turn they made and showed humans actually fighting each other, which makes it somewhat more realistic as it's pretty much difficult to completely unite 2 opposing factions with different ideals. I'm in love with the opening and season 3 made me much more interested in the franchise. It's not too cliched but at the same time, not too unpredictable. I give this anime a 9/10!",

Ok, caps lock off, the season starts of with some of the most fluid and beautiful one take action choreography I think I have ever seen in anime. We finally see Eren take a damn chill pill and reflect on his actions and the pain he has caused and strive to do better. I swear every season this show switches genre cause S1 was a straight action shounen, S2 was a psychological thriller, and this was very much a political thriller and it delivered really, really well. We finally understand certain characters that havebeen around since the beginning and the story is finally starting to show its hand in a way that doesn't feel contrived and is able to subvert expectations with certain things. I am firmly on this train and am excited to see where it takes me.",

            "content": "Well, this is the first time I'm making a review so yeah, deal with it.\r\nThis might contain some few spoilers: You have been warned.\r\nSeason 3 finally hits us with a new approach to the plot, instead of dealing with Titans, it deals with the politics, and Titans became very infrequent, focusing solely on the fight known as \"Attack on Government.\" \r\nNot that it's the bad thing, this is the season which will give answers to the question the viewers have since the first season.\r\nArt: 10\r\nWit Studio doesn't disappoint us this season, giving us viewer a very beautiful animations. Special mention to the most famous one,\"Levi vs Kenny's Squad\". There's no real issue with the animation, it was very outstanding to the point you're having a goosebumps.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nThe music is perfect this season as well, the OST which adds to the intensity of various scenes, ranging from well-choreographed fight scenes to the saddest episodes. The OP is amazing since it fits the arc, as well as the ending which created by the famous Linked Horizon. And of course, the infamous sound in the final episode which, admit it, we didn't see coming.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nEren - got some pretty decent development in this arc, in the previous season, he is very arrogant and very quick to into fights. In this season, he has learned to control himself and think properly. And if someone told you that Eren only spend this arc crying, let me tell you, it was justified.\\n\\n\r\nEren is a 15 year old boy, full of thoughts regarding revenge. In just a short amount of time, a lot has happened to him which is the following: almost got eaten by a Titan, discovered that can transform into a Titan, his friends from Squad Levi is killed, discovers that Annie is the one who killed them, found out the responsible for the murder of his mother, got kidnapped by the military, and found out the secret of his father. For a 15 year old boy, that was very heavy, telling him to shut up will not help, let him process everything.\\n\\n\r\nHistoria - her importance has been hinted in Season 2, seeing this played this season is very rewarding, \"Started from the barracks now a Queen.\" Her character has been fleshed out, her backstory is fully explained, and her importance to the plot is recognized.\\n\\n\r\nLevi - Levi is very fleshed out in this arc, his history and lineage has been revealed, how he got powerful, and how he actually feels. He's not just a badass character, he has a personality to match.\\n\\n\r\nAnd Erwin - Erwin's character has been fleshed out as well, and his commanding power, a lot has happened to him this arc and he has just one arm.\\n\\n\r\nThose four are probably the most developed characters in the series. But gotta give props to other as well.\\n\\n\r\nKenny - his existence screams badassery, he is a very interesting character and every screen time about him means something, from his introduction to his end, he has served his purpose.\\n\\n\r\nArmin - not really much, but his character developed from a lowkey pacifist to someone who will hold a gun to kill a person to save another person. It's a huge step up.\\n\\n\r\nMikasa - still the same, Mikasa being Mikasa, she really has no character development here, probably because she got one in previous season.\\n\\n\r\nAl in all, outsanding character developments.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\r\nNow, this one, the story's new approach is very refreshing, it decided to drift off from the usual to give way to plot developments. The story this time is taking down the government and put Historia as a Queen, because apparently, the government hides the truth to the people, everything is a spoiler so I won't tackle it further.\\n\\n\r\nThis also shows the history of the Royal Family where Historia belongs to and the cause of Grisha Yaeger's disappearance.\\n\\n\r\nThis arc is full of revelations which I deeply appreciate, since the reveals here will makes the plot go forward. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough, the anime decided to rearrange the events from the manga, it doesn't affect the storytelling at all since Isayama himself supervises it since he himself doesn't like how slow the arc.\\n\\n\r\nSo, this arc, overall, has a smooth movements in it's pacing, not too rush and not too slow.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this season.\\n\\n\r\n\"I don't know which option you should choose. I could never advise you on that... No matter what kind of wisdom dictates you the option you pick, no one will be able to tell if it's right or wrong until you arrive to some sort of outcome from your choice.\" - Levi Ackerman",

            "content": "Development is an important part of a series as a whole to keep people interested. If your characters remain stagnant, it's hard to follow an arc other than \"this person does this thing every 3 episodes to win.\" I think Attack on Titan has been a great example of the theme and purpose changing over time. While it starts out in Season 1 as what seems like gore porn, it develops into an intricate plot of a nation's issues with an overbearing monarchy, racism, and near total annihilation. While some mysteries are close to being solved, others still linger in the background. Two things havedeveloped well over these three seasons: the story, and the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe story has become almost a full political intrigue plot rather than simply a \"fighting giants\" story. It almost reminds me of how Code Geass wasn't \"just a mecha\" anime, it was a political story with a mecha theme. The actual structure of the society becomes much more apparent, with it's relation to the kingdom and how that power structure has remained in place for so many years. Family names even matter over time, with some clans being marked enemies of the state and others beloved and eternal friends. Some didn't really like the direction going away from the horrific and satisfying action, however I welcomed the change. Learning more about this universe seems integral to the experience, and parallels the one the characters go through as they learn about their very small world. Overall, the pacing is decent, and it doesn't suffer through some piss-poor ramp up/down episodes that so many shows seem fond of. It's a slow and methodical build to a climax that was pretty satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter's agendas are revealed over time, and it's not always just a one track monologue that reveals the villains plans, but slowly executed plot points where they try to impose their will on the world. Some are in it for power, some for peace, and some for revenge. However, slowly everyone's true intentions come to the forefront. Some also gain motivation over time, or change their points of view completely. Go back to S1 and see Eren's motivations as straight up revenge, and see if they stack up to how he ends this season. The skills of these characters develop over time, yet they also remind us that they still try to remain the same in personality between conflicts. They can create a character without making a stereotype, or having them be a one trick pony. Sasha is a good example, food is her main gag, but she's still played as a serious character in combat and story with her interactions with Conney and others.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had any complaint at all, it would be that I preferred the old art style. It's not that this new one is necessarily bland, but I thought the old one added a lot of flavor and intensity to the world. The fights and animations are still great to watch and pretty hype.\\n\\n\r\nStill, a strong third seasons, and with so many shows only getting two that's a welcome surprise.",

The Uprising arc in the manga was easily my least favorite arc in the series. There were too many politics and far too much dialogue that honestly felt like a chore to read. But this anime season, I swear they cut out all of the boring content.\r\nThis was an action filled season and yes there were still politics involved, but it was hardly a bore. I found this season truly thrilling and it's easily my favorite season yet. The animationis absolutely beautiful and I promise you that it won't be long when you start this season until you see some crazy scenes.\\n\\n\r\nKeep in mind this is just the first half of the season. The second half doesn't release for a while. So this season only covers the Uprising arc. I look forward to the second half! Highly reccomend this season.",

            "content": "The sequel we've been spared the wait for.\r\n- Story (8/10):\r\nUnlike the earlier installments, Shingeki no Kyojin Season 3 focused more on an aspect you never expect a show like this to address, more than fights and massacres, it was heavy on politics, but why would you complain? We at least got to know way more about the world of Shingeki no Kyojin than any other seasons, and thanks to this, a lot of our questions were answered, and the more episode you watched, the closer to the truth you get \u201cGotta tell this to my buddy, Erwin\u201d. Not to say fights were absent, oh no,there is a massacre on a huge scale, but the sheer exposure of world building and new information made those look very minimalistic.\\n\r\nA lot of things finally made sense, earlier we had something like an uncut follow of past events that we needed juxtaposition for so bad in order to tie some sense to them, that's what this season was mostly about. The pacing felt a little bit slow, mainly because of the dialogue-heavy nature of the season.\\n\\n\r\n- Art (9/10):\\n\r\nWe've gotten to the point where it's not at the least a surprise to expect high-quality animation, some fans will even use the franchise's title as a synonym for \u201cfantastic animation\u201d.\\n\r\nWithout having to stretch this any longer, you know you're getting your doses of blood, the gloomy color pallets only make the medieval atmosphere feel more dense and alive. However, the only complaint I have, and only had about Shingeki no Kyojin is the lack of variety for unique character face design, if you really took the time, you can spot a disturbing similarity in their general facial structure; short rephrased, they look alike.\\n\\n\r\n- Sound (9/10):\\n\r\nAs good as the animation, the soundtrack is as great. This season introduced a bit of a controversial opening theme song, which a lot of people thought it was an insult to the previous ones. I for one think it's a solid song with or without the Anime, it's great, it's packed with emotion, contracts the portrayed story arc very well, I get it's not your typical loud and hype Shingeki no Kyojin opening, but it remains better than some in respect of quality.\\n\\n\r\n- Character (8/10):\\n\r\nOut of all the other installments, Shingeki no Kyojin Season 3 was packed with character development, especially for Historia, you can even call it her season.\\n\r\nWe've got teased about her on the earlier seasons, especially season 2, and here we got to peek under the blanket and see what was up there, and oh boy was it shocking. Eren as well got to know some truth about his lost memories, and thus had his level up to some degree in terms of character building.\\n\\n\r\n- Enjoyment (7.5/10):\\n\r\nEntertainment comes in many forms, the earlier season gave us the hype with the cinematic dynamic camera freestyling over the fantastic battles, and this one had us watch out jows from hitting the ground from sheer wowing for what we get to know about the world of Shingeki no Kyojin. Enjoying your favorite characters' moments.\\n\r\nThe midpoint of the show was a little bit meh compared to the beginning and the ending points though.\\n\\n\r\n- Overall (8.3/10):\\n\r\nWe've been promised of getting a full 24 episodes action-packed third season, but at some point they decided to split it in half and have the first 12 episodes focus on the political stuff, and the other half reintroduce us to raw action in \u201cprobably\u201d the most hyped season yet, but unfortunately that got delayed for some time now.\\n\r\nFor me, season two is still the top of hype for the franchise, until we get some more shocking revelation and hyped fights that would remain as such. However, not to say that this season falls down in terms of quality of anything, we've just been spoiled way too much, having us wait 4 years for a sequel at the time had us hungry for more content, it made the good better and the bad good.",

            "content": "Attack on Titan (or Shingeki no Kyojin if you prefer that) is one of my favorite anime. I have seen several, but it always delivers excessive excitement, thrills, and a complex world with so much endearment. Season 2 was my favorite anime of last year and one of the best second seasons I've ever seen. Coming from that, I was a bit worried for this arc, as I had heard of it being poor and whatnot. However, the idea of politics and human V.S. human really got me excited. And it did not fail to deliver.\r\nSeriously though, the execution in this season man, like, ohmy god. The new plotline, following governmental things, had me a bit \"meh\" at first, to where I was questioning if this was really Attack on Titan. However, the ending of episode 1 had me pumped, and I knew exactly from then on that this was gonna be a damn good season. The chase scene in episode 2, the backstory to Historia in episode 3, almost every episode had something to offer, whether it'd be a major secret reveal, a memorable fight, or something else. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that really caught me by surprise was the development and the new characters, in particular with Historia. I was shocked at how much Historia has developed by the end of this season. After all of the development she had last season, I'm just completely shocked at how much more she got fleshed out. Other characters, such as Kenny and Rod Reiss, were nice additions to the cast. Levi got about 100000000x more screen time in this season than the last, and we even found out his backstory, which is quite nice. My only real complaint here would be the complete lack of Reiner, Bertholdt and Ymir, but I know they're going to play a major role in the next arc so not too dissapointed there.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation looks nothing short of spectacular, especially during the chase scene in episode 2. I'll admit there were some quality dips here and there, but that's expected with the situation that WIT is in. Despite some minor dips in quality, the animation is just simply breathtaking. Never has it looked THIS good. The OST is fantastic too, specifically the Kenny theme (don't know the actual name of the song but it's awesome). The opening is much different from previous openings, but is perfect for this season, and is simply holy. The voice of Hyde is stunning, and the opening is amazing. The ending theme is pretty good, especially in episode 12. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, this was another awesome season of aot. It did take a bit of a different turn compared to previous seasons but was just as thrilling, and provided so much history. I'll admit, I didn't enjoy this season as much as season 2, and the shock factor wasn't quite there, but I know season 3.5 (the second half we have to wait HALF A YEAR FOR) will have plenty of that, just from what I've heard and saw during the ending of episode 12. \\n\\n\r\n9.3/10\\n\r\nWe need season 3.5 NOW\\n",

            "content": "Attack on Titan (Shingeki no Kyojin if you prefer) is a series i have a very odd relationship with. It's first season is actually the show that properly got me into anime as a whole (i'm not counting things like Yu-Gi-Oh, Pokemon etc) and though over time as i watched more and better shows my opinion on it began to change and while i still enjoyed it i began to see things i didn't really like in the series, character and pacing issues in particular. It's second season however while it had a very strong first half, it's second half and ending left a verysour taste in my mouth. So when it came to the 3rd season i was not very excited going into it but was still willing to give it a fair try. And I can honestly say that... This is the best AoT has been without a shadow of a doubt i really liked S3 and while not perfect it certainly reignited my interest in the series. But without further adieu let's dive into the review.\\n\\n\r\nSo S3 picks up pretty much after the events of S2, i won't bother summarising as if your reading this you've likely watched both prior seasons. As opposed to prior seasons which were all \"Titans coming gotta kill em\" this season focuses on the corruption within the government as well as the history of the royal family and a few key characters. My biggest gripe in S2 was the lack of forward progression in the story. Yes there were a couple of big reveals but nothing that really progressed things, things started and ended in the same place or at the very least it was a tip toe forward. S3 thankfully has tons of forward progression, reveals, plot twists and answers to questions we've had since the first season. This coupled with some really good character development throughout this season have really helped elevate the story for me. However not everything is perfect. \\n\\n\r\n(Some spoilers ahead)\\n\\n\r\nMy biggest problem with the story is that in the initial setup is \"Eren's been kidnapped gotta rescue him\" for the 3rd goddamn time. Like if it was spaced out more i wouldn't mind too much, but the fact over all 3 season Eren has been kidnapped and rescued in ALL 3 seasons is honestly a bit of a joke. Also a particular scene in one of the later episodes which would've been a great scene, if not for the edgy dialogue. Like maybe that one is just me but too me the it came off as super edgy and kinda took away from what would've been otherwise a great scene. Also this isn't really a positive or a negative but still something i want to comment on. In the final episode there is a mid credit scene that is... interesting to say the least. It appears to be a flash forward to an event which will happen in S3 part 2, it just seems odd they'd choose to tease this since they've never done it before. Again not a positive or a negative just something i found odd. But regardless overall i feel that S3 has had a particularly strong story.\\n\\n\r\nArt has always been one of AoTs strong points. The show has always looked great and this season is no exception with Wit Studios really pulling out their A game in terms of art and animation with everything looking smooth slick and really really good, particularly in the action scenes. Outside of that the show still looks good no real complaints with the art overall\\n\\n\r\nSawano is on the soundtrack that's all i need to say... Fine i'll elaborate. Sawano once again pulls put his best for AoT. Like the man only really has one style, but he does that style so well that it doesn't really matter, pulling out some amazing tracks including a rap track that was used during one of the major fight scenes that I STILL HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO FIND, that was really damn good. Outside of the soundtrack the overall sound design is well done as always and the voice acting continues to be good as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of AoT have always been an interesting topic to me. Lots of people love them however I've always found the characters of the show to be rather weak. Not all of them mind, characters like Armin, Erwin, Jean, Hange, Levi as well as a few others are very well presented characters however i feel quite a lot of the characters have honestly been rather weak, either not getting any development or just being their to be killed. However S3 actually has a lot of really good character development for a few key members of the cast. For starters Eren... EREN ACTUALLY HAS CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT OH MY GOD FINALLY... Seriously prior to this season i HATED Eren. All he really did was yell, get captured, yell at people when they tried to explain stuff to him, then complain that he doesn't understand anything. However in S3 he actually has development as a character, ending this part of the season in a different place than he began which has slightly improved my opinion on him, i still don't really like him but it's a good starting point. Historia, who is the main focus of the arc also greatly benefits from development. And aside from a couple moments i feel fell flat she grew into a much stronger and more interesting character. There were some new characters introduced but the only real stand out was Kenny who serves as one of the antagonists and he is just such a fun character, i mean he's basically a steampunk cowboy you don't get cooler than that, but his story is also interesting and adds a lot more lore to the AoT world which was really cool. That all being said a lot of the newer characters introduced felt like filler characters to either be killed off or not do much regardless, a problem AoT has had for a while. And another problem i have comes from one particular character. Mikasa... now wait a sec, overall i think she is a decent character, a strong heroine who's backstory is interesting (even more so with some revelations made in this season) but her obsessive protective nature over Eren i think honestly detracts from her character. I get why she wants to protect Eren but it's just played up far too much and their was a scene towards the end of this season, where Eren and Historia are having a conversation after everything that had happened, Mikasa walks up does her scary eyes and takes Historia away. It's played more for laughs but i just really didn't like that scene and it detracted a bit from Mikasa for me. But overall i do feel that the character work in the season was very strong, stronger than it had been.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I enjoyed this season. It really rekindled my interest in AoT to the point i can say I'm legitimately excited for the second half of S3 next year. So if you've finished season 2 and still want more, i can say it only gets better here.",

            "content": "Since it is a split cour, time to make a review. I really looked forward for this season of Shingeki no Kyojin. In the trailer, they showed us that Levi is the main focus of this arc. Then on Ep.1, they introduced us (with the best way possible) to Kenny, the \"main villain\" of this arc/season and the one who took care of Levi when he was a kid. The first 2 eps delivered the hype. At that point my rating is a 9/10. They showed what I came for. A Levi centered arc. \r\nThen the next few episodes the focus was shifting away fromLevi and instead shifting to Historia and the Reiss Clan. They are simply uninteresting and they bore the hell out of me. At that point I was already losing my hype. Then the rest of the season focuses on them and Kenny just dies because he got caught from a blast which is pretty anti-climatic IMHO. I wanted a Levi centered arc not this since that is what they hyped. The first 2 eps are really amazing but as the episodes pass by, the quality decreases. Rod Reiss was just a mediocre villain. Just plain uninteresting. The lack of exposure between the relationship of Levi and Kenny just disappointed me.\\n\\n\r\nThis season also has the least sense of danger on all 3 seasons. On the first 2 seasons, I can feel that anyone could die at some point. On this season, no. I know everyone was going to survive at the end like a typical shounen anime.\\n\\n\r\nFor the positives, I like the flashback abour Eren's dad (Ep.11), the first 2 eps (I know I am spamming this but they are really awesome) and Erwin's part on the season.\\n\\n\r\nOverall a 5/10. Its still fine but very close to being a mediocre season (which is equal to a 4/10 in my ratings)",

Most episodes had a different story or plot and it made the story more suspended in my opinion, and that makes me want to watch more of it. Hearing Levi's story was also a great part for the season to add. I cannot wait for the new season to come out, as they keep continuing their adventure.

            "content": "This review is 95% spoiler free. (And pls bare with my english)\r\nFirst I'm gonna give my opinion on the whole shingeki no kyojin franchise. For those who remember the first time shingeki no kyojin came out know how much hype this anime took. That hype soon died out since there were no news on if we were getting more content or not. So years went by and AoT went from one of the most anticipated animes to almost a forgotten story. This brings us to 2017 and 2018 with 2 new brand season that failed to recreate the popularity this show once had which justgoes to show how disloyal or brutal the anime world can be.\\n\\n\r\nReview: I don't think people mention enough just how slow paced this anime was until the 3rd season. Events and story were happening way to slow since they wanted to do more character development (i guess). But they kick started this with a lot of action and a brand new story that got me real hooked up and grew new hopes in me for this season. Titans kinda lost their charm through out the seasons so this human government secret thing really spiced things up. Through the first 6 episodes action is literally non stop they waisted no time and i really liked how the story doesn't revolve around Eren no more and they expanded their range of story with additional character development. Every episode has a minor plot twist so it always keeps you guessing and stories from different characters crosses each path and connects a lot of things. Fights are great and most of all they gave us characters that we actually want to know such as Levi etc. After 6 or 7 episode pace kinda slows down and we get those type of episodes where there is a lot conversations that sorta prep you for a big twist or event later in the series. I must say there was a point where i thought they were gonna blow the season with some bs but it all turned out alright. Pace picks up again after a couple of boring scenes. There are still episodes to come so i can't yet write whole review for y'all.\\n\\n\r\nMy grade and honest opinion:\\n\r\nAs I'm writing this I'm currently waiting for ep. 12. I feel like THIS is how they should start the 1st season. Revolving the story around humans and their government. It has much more potential and has a lot more ways to finish up. Titans really lost all the credentials i felt like at times things were surrounded around them a bit too much to the point where they didn't bring the excitement they once did. They didn't keep them a mystery. Like they should and expose other things to us first.\\n\r\n I'm grading this around 6/10 just cause I'm taking all the series in to context and how they basically waisted 12 episodes on second season. But myb this one can change my mind as i said things are going great so far. \\n\\n\r\nI said \"story\" way too much lol",

            "content": "SPOILER FREE REVIEW.\r\nFirst let me say that as of writing this review I have only seen the first 10 episodes of this season and that my opinion of the show may change, while this review will remain the same as I am lazy af.\r\nArt/Animation: 2/3\r\nThe art in this show is on point the scenes are great and the characters are well designed. The animation is also amazing with most scenes looking amazing..... the key word there was most. Although not always noticeable, this show has some instances of very very bad CGI, quite often when the characters are using their grappling lines and the screenis moving rather fast. However, these scenes are not common and do not really hinder the enjoyment of the show. Despite this I cannot award a show that has instances of poor CGI a 3/3 for animation hence the 2/3.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 2/4\\n\r\nBland and typically story. There is the macguffin of the item in the bottom of Erins basement which drives the plot, and there are a series of interesting but predictable side stories keeping them from reaching said macguffin. \\n\\n\r\nCompared to last season, this season has good progression. The only thing I can really complain about is that the back stories are sometimes placed in rather frustrating positions. Although this is not always the case, for example the some of the backstory of (censored for spoiler)  is placed at the end of the arc, which does not mess with the passing, although he is kinda irrelevant now as  (censored for spoilers).\\n\\n\r\nAlso this anime seems to be pushing the story in an overly edgy vibes again, but this is something I have come to expect given the edge fest of Erins personality in season 1. \\n\\n\r\nFinally there are inconsistencies in this plot, nothing on the level of JoJo, but still present. Obviously these wont be discussed for spoiler reasons, and personally I don't really mind them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the story is nothing special but it is sufficient to push the viewers forward to the next action scene. Hence 2/4\\n\\n\r\nSounds/Music 2/3.\\n\r\nVoice actors in the sub are good and the dub is....... well it's a dub but as dubs go this is acceptable. Honestly my only complaint is the freaking OP which feels really out of place. Hence the 2/3\\n\\n\r\nBonus Points: 1\\n\r\nDespite my criticisms I actually enjoy this show quite a bit and it has come out in a very bland season where I only had Planet With and Overlord as decent animes (others were alright). So for giving me something to watch that was well produced and directed I am giving it one bonus point.\\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion 7/10\\n\r\nGood show, nothing  too spectacular. I personally recommend that all people who enjoy action scenes check it out. With the only real let down being the bog standard plot.  Go stream it on crunchyroll, personally I wouldn't pay for it though",

It was nice to take a break from the constant fighting and have some really touching character moments.\r\nAlso, Historia's arc was just done so beautifully. Gosh, do I love 1 (one) girl. This season alone is reason enough to continue watching the series. Though season 2 is close with this one. I just could go on forever about how everything they did including Historia was a masterpiece but that counts as spoilers so I cant,,,\r\nThe animation has also improved so much honestly. Also, the opening and endings were just beautiful, they really set the tone for the season.Of course, after getting such a \"nice\" season I'm not sure I'm ready for the upcoming bloodbath.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, Eren surprisingly got a lot more interesting as a character which I appreciated. He went from angsty \"argh I wanna kill titans\" to an actual character (in my opinion).\\n\r\nLevi's arc was also super duper good.\\n\r\nAlso, Sasha and Connie got some love so that's A+++++.",

It got from humans vs a sort of apocalypse, larger then life threats, or coping to deal with life issues, to piece of shit humans vs piece of shit humans. It is soo poorly fucking made, it makes Resident Evil and Game of Porns look like masterpieces.\r\nWhy the hell are the characters alot of the times over 9k on the retard level scale ? Why do they emo the shit out of some drama scenes, that don't absolutely relate or show any kind of lesson the characters havelearned from the past, or past experiences that help them cope with such issues ? You know what I'm talking about, BASIC FUCKING EVOLUTION. Or at least what every decent human being expects of anyone that has been through life, or through certain situations. The characters did not even evolve anymore, or at least stop evolving, it's worse, they devolved. \\n\\n\r\nWhy do characters that were implemented greatly, suddenly lose their shit or start wondering about their purpose etc. whithout any apparent reason whatsoever ? \\n\\n\r\nPlot holes ? This show has a bigger plot hole than Uranus. And I swear, those fucking random Titan powers, or wait, they're not random at all, they're fricking there to fix the shit story and the fucking plot holes. At this point, it wouldn't be surprising, at least to me, if any or all blonde characters start growing their hair and go SS4 and over 9k all of a sudden. It's just made in such mockery and ridicule that I can't even...I've even started wandering, is there any story, or anything happening this season even worthy of attention ? It's just so bad and random, I have a feeling the next plot twist will be even worse or just undo everything that's been done until now.\\n\\n\r\nWhy didn't they continue where they left off in season 2, and suddenly just starting throwing in characters or killing characters no one remembers or even cares about ? This season was so stupid and redundant, they literally could have covered it all in 1 episode, or by lettting 1 new character do his thing. Such a waste of time...And, at least for us human beings, time is the most important resource available to us, so I think some people will be able to understand my frustration with this season.\\n\\n\r\nIn all honesty, I am so disappointed, angry, annoyed and the resentment and loathe I have for this season (which I've been expecting for quite some time now), I can't even express in words...Never expected the series to take such a huge fucking nose first cliff dive.",

            "content": "This will be a review of all three seasons. \r\nThis was on my list of 'anime I will never watch' because for whatever reason I thought it was incredibly overrated and I didn't like the art style at all. Well, I spontaneously decided to look into it on New Year's Eve and then I just sort of flew through it in three days.\r\nStory 10/10: Everyone knows the basic premise for this one and I even went in knowing some pretty big plot points but that didn't stop it from blowing my mind. To me, it wasn't predictable at all, mainly because they every time theyrevealed the answer to one question, they managed to raise 10 more in its place. It's definitely more complicated than you'd expect, especially if you look a bit deeper into it. But the thing that surprised me the most was just how fast it moved. There was never a dull moment and I didn\u2019t skip a single scene, which is a pretty big feat. So many things happen within each episode and yet all of them are a breeze to get through. \\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10: Like I said, initially I didn't really like the overall art style, but when I saw everything in motion I just fell in love with it. Everything is so smooth and beautiful, from the characters to the backgrounds and the action scenes, it's just a feast for the eyes. It did take a while until I got used to the Titans, because they just look quite ridiculous compared to everything else, but that's not enough to make me complain.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10: As a massive fan of anime music in general, I loved the openings before I even watched the show, and that hasn't changed now, except for the fact that I can't listen to any of them without crying. I didn't get half as attached to the ending themes though, probably because I didn't really watch any of them, I was too eager to get to the next episode to waste time on that. As for the background music, I only paid attention to it when there was no dialogue or when it was a particularly amazing piece of music, but what I did pay attention to I really loved, especially the insert songs. No complaints about the voice acting.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10: I have this bad habit of not really paying attention to characterization, so unless it's really big and obvious character development, it'll completely go over my head on the first watch. Here, however, I was trying to actively pay attention to the characterization while also keeping track of the overall plot development, and at the same time trying not to get too attached to anyone because I had heard that this show likes to kill off its characters. Of course that plan completely backfired and I ended up getting attached to some characters I never thought I'd care about. I would like some more development from some characters, but that might be coming in the future, so I'm not really worried.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10: Here's the thing. This is a very intriguing and enjoyable show, but it's also pretty depressing. While I did enjoy it very much, and I was on the edge of my seat every single episode, it's definitely not a series that made me really happy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10: This ended up being so much better than I expected, and it's definitely going on my list of all time favourite anime, but I would hesitate to recommend it to everyone because of the overall depressing atmosphere and the unexpected creepiness of the Titans in general.\\n",

            "content": "This was EASILY the weakest season of Attack On Titan of the three.  Easily.  However, because AoT is awesome, it's still good and entertaining, but in comparison to its usual level of suspense, action and excellence, this season was a far cry from the previous seasons.  My biggest complaint is the backstory of the Reiss family.  Honestly, it just was kind of a letdown, as it exposes to some extent the origins of the Titans, and although it hasn't fleshed out fully, it looks like it's going to be pretty cliche.  I was hoping for more of a mystery orsomething different.   \\n\\n\r\nMy second problem with this season is the fact that they scaled back on the deaths.  AoT, for me, is an anime that gives you a feeling of hopelessness and despair, as you watch the heroes be trapped like rats with death coming for them at any time.  That was strongly missing in this season.  I see this anime sort of like the Walking Dead (Back when it was good) and you never knew who was going to go or how, so I could kind of vicariously live through the situation thinking: \"How can I survive?\"  That was ripped out with all of the jumping back and forth through the past to explain the backstory of Levi, Kenny, Eren, Historia and the Reiss Family.  \\n\\n\r\nI just didn't care much about Rod Reiss, to be honest.  And honestly, the entire final battle fell flat on its face to me. (pun intended).  Another thing I didn't care for was the intro.  Man, that was the worst intro music I've ever heard for an anime like this.  It looked more like an intro into a romance/drama anime, than a gory, action-survival anime.  It was terrible.  \\n\\n\r\nWith that being said, even though this was the worst season of AoT, it's still AoT, so it has a lot of good moments in it, too.  The battles that did happen throughout the anime were good, especially when Levi and his men would battle Kenny and his.  Kenny The Ripper was a good villain.  Probably the most interesting human villain in the anime so far.  And while the Reiss family backstory wasn't all that great, the palace intrigue angle with Erwin was very good and saved the anime.  \\n\\n\r\nAlso, the animation and production was improved this season.  It was definitely a cut above previous seasons.  And, as usual, the cast is strong, especially Levi, Mikasa, Henge and Erwin.  But, I experienced something new in the final episode.  Even though this was the worst of the seasons, what happened during the ending song, makes me more hyped to see Season 4 than ever before.  DO NOT SKIP THE ENDING CREDITS ON THE FINAL EPISODE.   That 30 second moment makes a kind of \"meh\" finish end with: \"Holy crap! What the hell?!\"  Don't miss it.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nSound: 4\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Attack on Titan (or Shingeki no Kyojin if you prefer that) is one of my favorite anime. I have seen several, but it always delivers excessive excitement, thrills, and a complex world with so much endearment. Season 2 was my favorite anime of last year and one of the best second seasons I've ever seen. Coming from that, I was a bit worried for this arc, as I had heard of it being poor and whatnot. However, the idea of politics and human V.S. human really got me excited. And it did not fail to deliver.\r\nSeriously though, the execution in this season man, like, ohmy god. The new plotline, following governmental things, had me a bit \"meh\" at first, to where I was questioning if this was really Attack on Titan. However, the ending of episode 1 had me pumped, and I knew exactly from then on that this was gonna be a damn good season. The chase scene in episode 2, the backstory to Historia in episode 3, almost every episode had something to offer, whether it'd be a major secret reveal, a memorable fight, or something else. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that really caught me by surprise was the development and the new characters, in particular with Historia. I was shocked at how much Historia has developed by the end of this season. After all of the development she had last season, I'm just completely shocked at how much more she got fleshed out. Other characters, such as Kenny and Rod Reiss, were nice additions to the cast. Levi got about 100000000x more screen time in this season than the last, and we even found out his backstory, which is quite nice. My only real complaint here would be the complete lack of Reiner, Bertholdt and Ymir, but I know they're going to play a major role in the next arc so not too dissapointed there.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation looks nothing short of spectacular, especially during the chase scene in episode 2. I'll admit there were some quality dips here and there, but that's expected with the situation that WIT is in. Despite some minor dips in quality, the animation is just simply breathtaking. Never has it looked THIS good. The OST is fantastic too, specifically the Kenny theme (don't know the actual name of the song but it's awesome). The opening is much different from previous openings, but is perfect for this season, and is simply holy. The voice of Hyde is stunning, and the opening is amazing. The ending theme is pretty good, especially in episode 12. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, this was another awesome season of aot. It did take a bit of a different turn compared to previous seasons but was just as thrilling, and provided so much history. I'll admit, I didn't enjoy this season as much as season 2, and the shock factor wasn't quite there, but I know season 3.5 (the second half we have to wait HALF A YEAR FOR) will have plenty of that, just from what I've heard and saw during the ending of episode 12. \\n\\n\r\nI'm looking forward for the next season.",

            "content": "So...I\u2019m reviewing this a lot sooner than I expected. \r\nAs some of you may know, Attack on Titan Season 3 was originally billed as a two-cour season, similar to the first season which premiered way back in 2013. However, following episode twelve, it was revealed that the season would be split cour, with the second half set to air in Spring of 2019.\r\nThis review should have come sooner, but I\u2019m having trouble typing since I\u2019m suffering nasty from Titan-Slaying withdrawal. \r\nAttack on Titan is going to be a hard show for me to review, because I love it so much to the point where I\u2019msure the show really isn\u2019t THAT good, but the hype gets me pumped so much that I can see no wrong and I\u2019ll be screaming \u201cSasageyo!\u201d as Mikasa cuts the nape or achilles heel of some giant titan. I like to call this Shounen Hype Syndrome. It\u2019s the same thing that made me see DBS as absolutely amazing even though looking back, it had quite a few rough spots.\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, a bit of bias, no problem though.\\n\\n\r\nAfter the the jaw-droppingly awesome second season, I feel that season three (or rather, this half of season three), dialed it back a bit, but I still think it was a bit better than the first season. The stakes were still high, the revelations weren\u2019t as insane as the second season\u2019s but still great, and the fights were as great as ever. While Titan Eren wasn\u2019t utilized that much, it\u2019s a bit of a refresher because it shows that Attack on Titan can still have marvelous fights while not relying too much on Titan vs. Titan.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve been told that Attack on Titan has a distinct shift where it starts being more of a thriller and human vs. human as opposed to the bleak Man vs. Nature conflict of the beginning of the first season. I can kind of see it here: the first antagonist of the season is Kenny the Ripper - an infamous serial killer who, along with his task force, is tasked with taking out the scouts who are caught up in a smear campaign. The fact that their equivalent of the ODM gear is specifically made to fight humans instead of Titans drives this point home. While I can start seeing the series shifting, it feels naturally and doesn\u2019t seem like it betrays what makes AoT what it is. If you loved season 1 and 2, you\u2019ll love 3.\\n\\n\r\n(You probably won\u2019t love the opening though, that\u2019s just bad. Here\u2019s to hoping they change it for the next cour.)\\n\\n\r\nIn general, backstories seem to be the focal point of season three so far. I personally think they\u2019re handled well. I was more invested in these backstories than Ymir\u2019s in season two, even though I acknowledge that her\u2019s was really important to the plot. They just seem to compliment the present action very well.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that I took notice of was that the main trio was out of focus, a bit. Naturally, Eren got the most screen time of the three, but Mikasa and Armin seemed just like they were warming the bench. I hope they\u2019re up to bat in the second cour. Though, this isn\u2019t too much of a problem - AoT has a large cast of characters and I cared about them now more than ever.\\n\\n\r\nEpisodes were still fast-paced and were over in the blink of an eye, making me want more and then lamenting that I had to wait a week for the next episode.\\n\\n\r\nWhile, again, the action and revelations weren\u2019t as good as season 2, this season was amazing in its own right.\\n\\n\r\nProduction is still top-notch. Characters look great and action is fluid. It\u2019s part of the reason that I\u2019m not that upset over the hiatus. As they say, it\u2019s not easy being beautiful, and if it takes half a year for Wit Studio to give us more quality episodes, I will wait.\\n\\n\r\nPatiently\\n\\n\r\nAgonizingly \\n\\n\\n\r\n9.5/10",

            "content": "(May contain some minor spoiler)\r\nShingeki no Kyojin Season 3 started approx. a year after the second season landed. With the increasing hype over time, fans are delighted to see and experience more about Eren and his team to fight against the Titans. What I like about this series is its grasp over the suspense (that other anime rarely have imo), but then again it's not flawless.\r\nStory\r\nFor examining and adapting from the manga, it has some good aspects to it. Some changes happened, but nothing crucial or important. What I experienced is that the anime has accomplished to execute the fight scenes as good as themanga, but lacks the political issues that bring the most intense atmosphere to the table.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nI find it pretty good, the art is consistent and well-damn prepared at its best. Nothing to talk much about here. \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe appearances of HYDE for the new opening shocked the entire world that time, but for me it's not a big deal. Both the opening and the ending are quite enjoyable, and the pretty soundtracks all along the series is again, made by Hiroyuki Sawano. What do u expect.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThis is when I see some minor problems. There are few aspects that SnK S3 failed to grasp, such as fulfilling certain character development. Maybe some of u will argue that it's more than enough to develop such character, but I believe the series can push it more. Not the best aspect of the series tho.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nIt's Attack on Titan, and it's packed with a lot of surprise and fulfillment. I'm gonna give it a 8/10 for this category.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nIn conclusion, SnK S3 or Attack on Titan Season 3 is worth watching, IF, ONLY IF, you watch the first 2 seasons. Please, if you want to watch this series, go watch those two first. For u that haven't read the manga and haven't watch those 2, I suggest to not read the manga and watch them instead. You'll be hooked entirely by it.\\n",

            "content": "I enjoyed this far more than I expected.\r\nShingeki no Kyojin Season 3! Finally, the season I've been waiting for. Well, as a non-manga reader this season was amazing. With the release of season two, I was a bit underwhelmed that it didn't explain much, but just put me further into the dark. I was honestly not even looking forward to this season, that is until I saw the first few episodes. The insight on the world that has been teased at us for so long has finally had some light shed on it, and it's never looked better. We know so much more from thisseason alone it would be an understatement to call it the best season in terms of story development. With slice of comedy added here, and the interesting twists, this season is a wild ride.\\n\\n\r\nWithout spoiling much, the characters really have grown up since we first saw them during their training. Eren and the crew really have matured even in the small time frame that everything has taken place. Many people dislike the characters because of the \"lack of development\" but honestly, I like the fact that they haven't changed much, rather then just growing up. Personally, it gives a sense of realism that really fits in this particular show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I really don't want to spoil much since this season is still kinda new. But I personally loved this season far more than the last. There's so much more story development and the characters really show their mature side this time around. The animation and sound are both still amazing.\\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend this season to anyone who has been following this anime.",

They've been focusing so much on everything else that it more or less feels like a budget movie than an emotional rollercoaster. \\n\r\nThe music isn't played as it should and the theme is quite boring.\\n\r\nAll that removes the excitement.\\n\\n\r\nI hoped that I would get the insight enough to get a relation to the characters but instead they interrupted every compassionate moment with too much dialogue and plain face expressions.\\n\\n\r\nI'd say that when you no longer care about Eren - then the anime has lost the core purpose.\\n\\n\r\nThe second important thing is what they focus on.\\n\r\nMany times, as well as when they try to add some humourous cuts, they don't really add the hint about if it's important or not. Sometimes you even get confused if it's supposed to be fun or important.\\n\r\nIt's so serious right now that even when they try to make joke, you're not longer aware if it's included to the plot or just a laughable controversy.\\n\r\nTake it a bit further! Extend the lines!\\n\r\nWhen everything is so \"delayed\", the music theme is off and the situational feelings isn't there, me as a viewer doesn't know how I should react to that particular scene.\\n\\n\r\nThat's why I can't give it more than \"Good\". The expressions doesn't support the plot.\\n\\n\r\nSince it's hard to keep this review out of spoilers, I can't really specify what I mean but if you keep what you read in mind, then you might understand. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime isn't bad, but it doesn't feel as it used to do. I'd still recommend everyone to watch it",
