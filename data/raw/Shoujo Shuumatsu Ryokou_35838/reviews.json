            "content": "Strolling through a grey and barren wasteland, two girls are on a journey. Rations are their only food, each other's company their only comfort and a Kettenkrad motorbike and a protect rifle their only partners. This is a story about a post-apocalyptic future, cultures lost in war and appreciating the little things in life.\r\nFew future settings display the thoughtfulness present in Girl\u2019s Last Tour: war has, multiple times, left its mark on Earth and humanity. The numerous layers of the forsaken and metallic city tell tales of many civilizations long gone; their technology gradually grows more sophisticated and the cityscape more complex by the layer.Their different religious beliefs, or lack thereof, as well as their different perceptions of beauty are ingrained in them: some show idealistic symmetry spread evenly throughout, others are dominated by religious symbols resembling a progressed Christianity. However, their god seems more like an alien creature possibly playing a central role in mankind\u2019s long history of war\u2026\\n\\n\r\nThe themes and background of the show allow for contemplation and its war-ridden lands give ground for cynical criticism of war, but Girl\u2019s Last Tour is not at all about nihilism, the cruelty of war or the dangers of technological advancement. With overpowering optimism and gratitude for life, it avoids dwelling on many of its philosophically potent and open-ended questions through the sheer simplicity of its appreciation for the here and now; there is solace in solitude and beauty in company.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s hard not to get swept up in the show\u2019s pensive mood, but it is near impossible not to fall in love with the protagonists' fun antics: Yuuri and Chito have amazing chemistry and partaking in their intimacy is a truly soothing experience. The two share a heartwarming bond of love and trust and remind one of simpler days; to take the role of an onlooker is to embrace a heartwarming nostalgia.\\n\\n\r\nChito is the duo\u2019s brain: she is literate and reliable. Over the years, she has learned to work around Yuuri\u2019s shortcomings and deal with her eccentricities. At times, her diplomatic mindset clashes with Yuuri\u2019s air-headedness. However, she has no issue striking back should it get overbearing, for she knows it\u2019s the only way to get through to her dense companion.\\n\\n\r\nIn comparison, Yuuri might at first seem like an unpleasant person. She is a glutton, unreliable and at parts overbearingly annoying - but actually a very caring individual. She keeps looking out for Chito and ensures her safety, she is sorry when Chito is hurt and does her best to express her guilt. It is not only her shortcomings that need to be worked around: her partner has serious fear and submits to panic at the blink of an eye. Fortunately, Yuuri always stays supportive of her.\\n\\n\r\nRusty pipe systems, snow-clad plains filled with weapons of war and desolate temples - the show\u2019s landscape is empty and its designs range from simple to highly complex. The dark, barely saturized, grey color palette only changes during dreams and revelations. Unlike one might initially assume, the empty and wistful world radiates a romantic feeling. While it may be devoid of nature and has no ecosystem to speak of, the countless tales told by the cityscape itself more than make up for it. The bubbly moe character designs help alleviate the central juxtaposition of the cold world and the comforting company of the two protagonists (and whomever they might meet along the way).\\n\\n\r\nSuch sparse environment rarely allows for much movement to take place, but through dosated usage of CG the show enables engaging camerawork and alleviates the overall experience. The CG itself does unfortunately not hold up to the gorgeous and detailed look of the hand-drawn backgrounds but it in turn allows the explosive scenes to benefit from the momentum achievable through animation - and they look great!\\n\\n\r\nThe show\u2019s solid visuals are accompanied by both upbeat and melancholic music. In insert songs, the vocalist creates a great feeling of departure encompassing an euphoric mood and a grieving goodbye. On the other hand, the Opening and Ending songs excel through their sheer musical simplicity. They embrace modern electronic music and pop culture (the moonwalk and even dabbing), depicting and enhancing the fun shenanigans of the two girls and their endless journey.\\n\\n\r\nDue to its metallic landscape, the soundscape of the show mostly consists of industrial sounds: petrol engines, gunfire and cold, metallic echoes dominate, and their prevalence is only trumped by the two girls\u2019 dialogue.\\n\\n\r\nGirls\u2019 Last Tour is lighthearted and emotionally poignant; it excels through simplicity and thoughtfulness, but never dwells on the latter. The juxtaposition of its thematically dense but desolate cityscape and the intimacy of the main duo create a melancholically wholesome experience and make it one of the best shows of the year.\\n\\n\r\nScore: 85\\n",

            "content": "Ok, so it seems like i am the only guy in this entire site that didn't like this show (at least in the review section), so i fell the need to write why this show is so terrible.\r\nAlso, this is my first review in the site and i'm not a native english speaker, so sorry if the structure of this review seems garbage to you.\r\nFirstly, i want to say that i was very excited to see this show when it came in the seasonal chart, i didn't know how it whould be, but even if it was just a generic slice of life show, itwould be interesting just by the premise, bonus it was made by White Fox, that is one of my favorite studios.\\n\\n\r\nWhat i got was really dissapointing: a show about literelly nothing, most of the show is just these two girls walking and visiting some unisteressing place, and that is it, i wouldn't have a problem with that if the show had something interssing that could haddle it to be entertaining, but... what this show have of entertaining?\\n\\n\r\nStory? None of it, most of the show is episodic and there is barely any worldbuilding. Good comedy? Nah, there is barely any comedy at all and the few jokes are just Chito punching Yuu. Cute girls suffering shit? Meh, the girls act like the fact that they are the last two humans in the entire earth are just normal business. Some philosophic and 2deep4u shit? Nope, none of the stories have any meaning at all.\\n\\n\r\nNot saying that a anime MUST do some of these things to be good, these are just some ideas of things that Shuumatsu could do to be at least enterteining, but shuumatsu does none of it and does nothing that i didn't say too, it's just two girls living, nothing is fun, must of the stories barelly have a conflict, nothing has any purpose at all, everything is just a great piece of nothing.\\n\\n\r\nAnd bonus, this show is slow as hell, it drags a in a lot of things just to fill that 23 minutes mark, like bake a loaf for entire 2 minutes or take 3 minutes with a montage that is pure filler, and all those facts combined result in to the most boring show in this entire year, i think i could not watch it all if i didn't watch it weekly, cause must of the time i was just waiting for the episode end so i could do something better.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that could have saved this show would have good characters to handle the boredom, but that brings in another problem that is the characters are more bland then a piece of paper, they're uncharismatic, boring and do not stand out, and this wouldn't be a problem in a normal show, but this are the ONLY 2 characters in the entire show, you can't just be this lazy and expect the viewer to give a shit about then in this way.\\n\\n\r\nI could also talk why this ending is forced and totally garbage, but spoilers are agains't the Review Guidelines, so if you want to know, ask in my comments.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, this show is just a waste of premise and it's a shame that such talented people did work in this, i hope WF give us a better work next time.",

            "content": "Imagine you\u2019re trekking into a dense forest with your friends. The sun is going down and it\u2019s getting late. Then, you hear strange unknown noises coming from all directions around you. You check your phone and it has no signal. You can\u2019t find the compass in your pocket and there\u2019s no food left. Now, you and your friends just realized\u2026you\u2019re lost. You\u2019re in trouble.\r\nI don\u2019t know how many of you have been in this type of situation before but watching Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou brings a similar feeling. The idea of being lost in an unknown place evokes a sort of uneasiness. The constant fear ofdanger, feeling restless, and hoping to survive is what really attracted me to this show. To me, Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou (Girls\u2019 Last Tour) is much more than just a world-end journey. It\u2019s a show that combines slice of life with post-apocalyptic themes for the sake of survival. Do they need a reason beyond that? Not really. Yet, it doesn\u2019t really need more to sell its masterful storytelling.\\n\\n\r\nTo be clear, this anime takes place in the aftermath of a vague apocalyptic event. What do I mean by vague? It basically means that the anime doesn\u2019t fully explain the details of what happened in the past. It only leaves behind details with places, objects, and symbols that characters will discover. In the meantime, this anime does a solid job at world building. Essentially, their world is dead. It\u2019s devoid of almost all life. What\u2019s interesting to note is that the structures, gadgets, and weapons looks realistic enough to relate to our world. These range from food factories, libraries, tall towers, and among others. Even some of the weapons that appears in the show looks realistic such as the guns and iconic tank that the two characters operate. Throughout this anime, we can only interpret the various mysteries of their world. To be honest, that\u2019s what makes it intriguing. The anime doesn\u2019t give true answers and leaves the viewers to theorize with their own imaginations. \u201cWhat happened to this world?\u201d is a big question mark I\u2019m sure most viewers will formulate throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re invested into a linear storytelling of complexity, turn back now. This show isn\u2019t to please a certain demographic but instead relies on its creativity to do the storytelling. Every episode is an adventure of its own as Chito and Yuuri makes new discoveries during their journey. At times, it almost feels like playing an open world game like Assassin\u2019s Creed Origins or Fallout. The vast open world of unknown leaves behind so much to explore and honestly, it\u2019s what bought the most interest for me. From cultural symbols to mysterious ruins, it\u2019s a show that carries itself without a plot doing the talking. Our two heroines, Chito and Yuuri walk the earth without an end goal and it\u2019s dazzling at how much interest they bring in.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, Chito and Yuuri are the main characters that ultimately connects the show together. Without these two, there wouldn\u2019t be a journey. Watching Chito and Yuuri together really shows that the two has a unique relationship. Chito\u2019s calm composure balances out Yuuri\u2019s easygoing personality and two makes a dynamic approach to their survival. For instance, Chito has the skill to drive Kettenkrad (their spider-like tank). She\u2019s the one usually making decisions thanks to her literate skills. On the other hand, Yuuri has the knowledge to operate firearms, a skill essentially for their survival. The two make an interesting team in that although they don\u2019t always agree, they\u2019re able to collaborate to survive. However, a big part that attracted me about the duo is their character chemistry. There really isn\u2019t many characters in this show so watching these two connect really brings the best out of each other. There are episodes that show their imaginative creativity and make the most of their situation. Despite their current condition, Chito and Yuuri enjoys each other\u2019s company and even has fun when the opportunities present itself. Their small talk is also meaningful that even includes some philosophical dialogues from time to time. Still, this show does introduce a few characters although they only make sparse appearances. Kanazawa and Ishii are human beings that our main duo will encounter. Their encounter with them brings an interesting side and provokes a question such as \u201care there others like them out there?\u201d Their role in the show is also interesting to note as they help each other to survive while accomplishing their own goals. Later on in the show, there\u2019s also another character introduced although it swings into the otherworldly category. \\n\\n\r\nYou would think a show like this is about despair and sadness. No. If you take notice, you can easily discover that Chito and Yuuri lives their daily lives happily. Their journey takes them to ruined cities as they scavenge for supplies. They even hope to make memories from this journey with the help of a camera. Additionally, there are episodes that puts these two into ludicrous positions such as being drunk. I can also honestly confess that the show is emotionally appealing on different levels. Chito and Yuuri\u2019s relationship give the impression that no matter how desolate a world can be, there\u2019s hope and joy. Adapting a show like this really takes skill and I am very impressed by the craft the creators applied. As a manga reader, I\u2019m also glad that the anime captured the mood of the show throughout each episode. It\u2019s mostly faithful and really does a solid job at selling its ideas.\\n\\n\r\nWhite Fox has been experimenting with a variety of genres recently. To make this anime really needed effort as adapting a desolate world is no easy task. Thankfully, I can say that they did a stellar job at adapting the visual quality of the show. The atmospheric feel really hits the marks with designs of the city ruins, cultural objects, and even weapons. Kettenkrad is a tank that people can relate to our modern world while the weapons such as rifles are visually realistic. The most interesting part is perhaps the character designs of Chito and Yuuri. The two look like characters from a cartoon. Some viewers might not be too keen on accepting them but it should be recognized that they are more complex than they appear. This is expressed through their character expressions. There\u2019s no succinct way to put it but the two really draws a line between abnormal and normalcy. Their expressions evoke emotions from laughter, sadness, and curiosity. To note, there\u2019s also some fan service but viewers should overlook that as those parts stand as a foil to the despair of this desolate world. You\u2019d think these girls would be dressed like they are child soldiers read to go to war but in reality, they just live life.\\n\\n\r\nI can\u2019t say this enough but the soundtrack is stunningly beautiful. Music composer Kenichiro Suehiro shows his craft through the simplistic yet very convincing OST for this show. The melancholic tone with the eerie vibe every episode gives off matches perfect with the setting. Not to mention, I\u2019m also impressed by the avant-garde style of the theme songs. It\u2019s unique with a catchy tone that\u2019s hard to miss. Finally, praise should be given to the two main heroines. It only took one episode to convince myself that Chito and Yuuri\u2019s voices matches perfectly with their personalities.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve watched this show several times during its duration and it still feels like I only scratched the surface. Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou is a rare anime that took on a peculiar premise and turned it into a near masterpiece. It has the ability to get viewers invested without an overlaying plot. The characters are deceptively complex. With a world setting filled with mystery, it\u2019s no wonder you can find yourself lost. Don\u2019t worry though. It won\u2019t be like one of those trekking trips where you get drenched in fear. No, it\u2019s a show that breathes life into such a post-apocalyptic world.",

            "content": "We can be in the presence of a deja-vu, an anime about children (I used that words before).  Could it surprise us as Made in the Abyss did? Will we feel empathy with those kids in a post-apocalyptic world? The truth is that we can be surprised one more time. \r\nWe live our lives hastily surrounded by numerous technological devices. We consider that our daily tasks, such as eating and taking a shower, are \"habitual,\" and we never asked ourselves what would happen if life change due to destruction and a terrible war. What would happen if we lose those things? What would wedo to survive? Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou takes us to a time where civilization disappeared because of war. The only memory of the existence of the culture lies in the numerous ruins of cities and the devices that once served humans. The animation captivates us with an incredible story of friendship, trust and the constant struggle to survive. Day after day the actions of two girls are a ray of hope in a desolate world.\\n\\n\r\nThe story 9\\n\\n\r\nThe world is a hostile, challenging and sometimes somber place. The constant struggle between nations led to chaos and destruction where countless lives were lost. The war took to oblivion the meaning of the civilization that once existed. The bonds of this condemned world are reflected in the few survivors who day after day must be scavengers to obtain a supply that can prolong their existence in a dead world and thus give meaning to their lives\\n\\n\r\nTwo girls, Chito and Yuuri, wander in the middle of the solitude, the ruins and the deteriorated structures of what was once a society. In the same way, they struggle to find their daily sustenance. A simple ration bar could be a treasure, a place to bathe would be a longed-for dream. In summary, all the dreams changed for the constant struggle to survive. Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou's story has an incredible context that could make you remember writings from Martin Heidegger and Jean-Paul Sartre that talk about human existentialism. In the same way, the story leads this duo to question about life, death and human nature. \\n\\n\r\nThese girls have dreams, feelings, fears that are exposed in each episode and are perceived by the spectators. They transform a simple rain into a musical festival and maintain a high level of optimism that we can observe in the various actions, games, and jokes that they make throughout the plot. However, you can ask yourself if one day you will find an answer to what happened to the world and if these girls will live long enough to grow and have a happy life if there is one.\\n\\n\r\nThe setting of Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou is excellent. The anime portrays the scars of a war that happened a while ago. Abandoned buildings, rusty pipelines that vanish in the shade as the last sign of life and in the midst the survivors. Elements such as the environment show the catastrophic scenario that these girls have to endure in order to survive day after day. Maybe those details add more realism to the story.\\n\\n\r\nSomething you can notice is the constant need to move, climb and reach higher levels. We can compare that world with a spiral without an apparent end. What will they find in the higher levels? What difficulties will appear? Moreover, the world is full of mysteries, one of them is the reason for the war, another the \"statues\" that arise during the adventure that perhaps are part of a higher purpose and a camera that keeps the records of the lost memories. \\n\\n\r\nThe most exciting part is how the information is delivered to the viewers. The story advances with these girls and the audience advances with them. The viewer is an active part of the story since it depends on these girls and is not a simple observer. The story has good pacing it has a lovely narrative that will keep you hooked until the end. \\n\\n\r\nSometimes, for a lot of spectators is difficult to sympathize with children or to find an animation about children engaging. However, this duo maintains the innocence of their age no matter what problems they have had. They still act like little girls in a devastated world. Yes, I know that, under certain circumstances, they must make decisions as adults, but I liked that they still have dreams, that they question everything and that they want to discover new things. In other words, they are not adults, Chito and Yuuri still have a childhood to live. For example, I will always remember when Yuuri tried to draw Chito in the diary. That kind of moments matches the innocence and youth of the characters that sooner or later will have to mature. Finally, the series highlights several ideas such as friendship, trust, the need to be together to survive. What would they do if one of them were in danger near death? \\n\\n\r\nPitifully, the story does not conclude entirely. Maybe we will need to wait some time to see a full conclusion. However, the final episode could give you a partial completion where the emotions (sadness, love) were present. It will reveal some mysteries and facts that we were suspecting.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9\\n\\n\r\nThe most delightful couple of the season. Chito and Yuuri could be very different, but they care for each other. Moreover, they are in a constant fight to survive, but they maintain the innocence of a child that isn't corroded by the war or any other event. \\n\\n\r\nChito. She is the brain of the group, she takes smart decisions but also is very fragile and has some fears. She likes to read and writes a journal. Also, she keeps the duo working for a higher cause, surviving or maybe feeding Yuuri. \\n\\n\r\nYuuri. She is the muscle and the comedian of the group also is a good shooter. You can see her as Chito's guardian. Her humor is fantastic she can make us forget about that desolated world with her actions and jokes. For example, it was hilarious when Chito comment to Kanazawa \"she burns others books,\" and Yuuri's expression was pretty amusing.  \\n\\n\r\nArt 8\\n\\n\r\nEach episode offers excellent detail and artistic quality. However, some CGI can be observed in some camera angles (mostly on the Kettenkrad motorbike), but they are not so strange and do not damage the narrative. Also, the series has an intelligent use of lighting. You can feel that the world is gone. The light is contrasted each scene showing the designs where the decadent world (rusty pipes), abandoned machinery, weapons. The camera angles used in the scenes are correct and keep the eyes occupied in the critical parts of the narrative and the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters' design is not very detailed. Moreover, they are a bit simple, they follow a chibi art, for some persons they have a mocking style, but I liked it in general, and it helps to have a better idea of \u200b\u200bthe personalities of the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is pretty amazing. I am a bit amazed by the score; it can compete with Made in the Abyss. Also, the track rises the climax of each episode. For example, the central theme (Episode 1, Ending) adds the concept of mystery and innocence to the story. The sound mix is excellent, you can feel with your senses the desolation and the ruins because the sound boosts the ambiance and the characters actions. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP is very catchy, has a constant rhythm where you can see some traits of the main characters, and it has interesting lyrics. About the ED, it isn't as good as the OP but in general is a good song. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9\\n\\n\r\nIn each episode, I expected to see answers to some mysteries, and I was waiting for what this pair would find. I wanted to follow the story. However, maybe the plot has some problems since we will not have all answers to all questions and there is no real ending that reveals us the future of this unique duo because the manga is still in progress. No matter this issue I liked how this pair acted and tried to find answers to philosophical questions such us life and death, and the reason for the existence.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9\\n\\n\r\nShoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou was a surprise. In my case, I want to see the answers to the mysteries, I want to understand more about what happened to that desolate world and, above all, I want to see if these girls will survive the adventure in this world. Unfortunately, I'll have to wait a while for that, and I'm sure you will have similar feelings towards this magnificent story because you will see it regardless of my recommendation.\\n\\n",

I know you don't think of Studio White Fox when you think of cute girls, even though they did Is The Order A Rabbit?, because they're most famous for thrillers like Steins;Gate and more recently Re:Zero. That said, they pulled this off near perfectly.\r\nWhen I was first told about this show, it was said the manga was flat out boring. It was said Girls' Last Tour had no depth and was the stereotypical cute girls doing cute things with nothing to it type of thing. I think theexact words were, \"Your not going to get another Mushishi or anything,\" as that show is quite renowned as the peak of intellectual slice of life shows. When I went back to read some of the manga a week ago, I found out that they weren't wrong about the manga, it's just the adaptation was so good you never could've guessed how this manga evolved into it.\\n\\n\r\nEverything about this world feels alive. Both our main characters are so full of personality and feel so real to me. If you think Chi is going to be the straight man while Yuu is the genki with nothing more to it then you're so painfully wrong. Their characters have so much depth of writing, and while their backstory isn't explained to the extent I would've liked, it doesn't even matter because you see them develop over the course of the show such that a backstory to explain who they are is simply unnecessary. And don't even get me started on their chemistry. How can a show with basically TWO characters be this human and entertaining?! Their interactions are so funny when they want to be and serious when they have to be. The tone shifts naturally and the writing goes with it, which allows the show to fully commit to any emotion it want to convey.\\n\\n\r\nI'd also like to praise the animation and sound design. This might be a bit of a stretch here, but the show I can most closely relate to Girls' Last Tour in these categories is Kill la Kill. The animation isn't Kyoto Animation level of perfection and stunning flawlessness; it's more of Trigger's fun, poppy, not too serious animation that really lets the personality and style of the show stand out over mere technical impressiveness. That's not to insult the professionals who take their craft seriously, it's simply to say this type of show needed to let itself loose to capture the feeling that it did for me. The score and sound design are totally perfect and inventive in ways a most creators would never even think of. Sound effects will break out into song, and already well integrated songs will inform the themes. So many scenes are amazing concepts with equally amazing execution, and they are so on the strength of the sound design and OST alone. I simply think you should go listen to it and get entranced with the emotions like me and many others did. Again, this show's score and sound design are perfect; it captivates you exactly as it needed to.\\n\\n\r\nYet again, the slice of life genre is a masterpiece. If you're looking for some hardened men, killer action sequences, mind breaking cliffhangers, brutal action sakuga, and most importantly NO MOE, then this is certainly not for you, but if you're looking for literally anything else, I promise Girls' Last Tour will have something to say to you as it did to me. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading.",

            "content": "Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou - Series Review\r\n\tWhat if there really was a world where you and your very best friend were supposedly the only two people left in the world after a post-war society? How would that feel, being with the one and only person you ever wanted to be with until you die, experiencing hardships, connections, good times, and everything in between? Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou gives me an idea of how that would feel and for some reason that idea has kept popping back up in to my head. You and your friend are just lost in what seems like an endless \u201csandbox world\u201d toyourselves, maybe even seeing people along the way. There\u2019s always that tense feeling of not knowing what you will see next or what\u2019s waiting for you in the near or distant future. Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou may not be seen as the best anime series ever by most people, but to me, I felt a connection. A connection with the environment, the characters, and the dialogue\u2026 everything. I want to explain why this is my favourite series of all time without being biased. This is all my opinion, and I hope that you can understand why this is the best anime I have watched as of the time I have made this review.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe story is set in stone right from the first episode. Chito and Yuuri are supposedly the last two people left in society, maybe even the last living organisms in society. Everyday they rely on what they learned from what they found the day before. They are always finding new things to discover, and the show really pulls you in from what they find each episode. In this post-war apocalyptic environment, you\u2019d expect quite a melancholy of a story if anything, with the whole story being about how the last two people left in the world only have the small things that are ahead of them to look forward to. That\u2019s not the case for Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou. In fact, Chito and Yuuri\u2019s journey is fairly merry and joyful. Most of the experiences that are bad overshadow the good because of how short the bad moments last. It makes this show much more enjoyable and shows that all the sad moments in life should only last such a small amount of time, and you should only focus on the best parts of it. That\u2019s what I love about this show. Maybe you have depression, and you really connected with this show. That\u2019s basically the same case for me; I think that this show tells you that even if life is hard at times, nice things still happen, and you should shift your focus on those nice things. Then, your life will be much happier. Chito and Yuuri had left their parents from a society that seems to have no backstory other than that, making it raise a lot of questions and makes this anime more mysterious as it goes on. Who knows what could have happened to that society besides the fact that it was most likely torn down by war? To be honest, anime that propose a question or have mystery elements to them are some of my favourite aspects of anime in general.\\n\\n\r\n\tWhite Fox is known for being really experimental with what they make and they always love to reach out to new genres. They have made a lot of amazing anime and I appreciate how hard they work on making things perfect. Steins;Gate was an amazing anime for me and it\u2019s honestly unforgettable. They also made some other really great series like Katanagatari, Akame ga Kill, Re:Zero, Gochuumon wa Usagi desu ka, Hataraku Maou-sama, and probably more. Of course, Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou adds to the amount of great series they have made. Their way of adapting Tsukumizu\u2019s art style was perfect and it feels like Tsukumizu could have even made the anime herself if she could. The landscape and scenery stand out a ton in many episodes and attention to detail in scenes that need to be pointed out as the most important parts are absolutely stellar, hell, maybe I can even call it flawless. I have this attachment to how cute the style of the characters are and it makes me happy everytime I see them. White Fox just did really good at making this anime adaptation and I\u2019m so glad they did.\\n\\n\r\n\tChito and Yuuri are characters that feel real in a way that makes it very relatable to many people. They are almost like opposites to each other, and their interactions display many different emotions and they clearly are happy that they are together in this end of the world society. It makes me wonder how it would feel like if me and my best friend were in a society quite like the one in Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou. Chito is the character that worries a lot about what\u2019s ahead and does repairs to the Kettenkrad. She seems to be a lot more of a survivalist than Yuuri is, but her personality is really adorable. Yuuri is the carefree and happy go lucky character, and honestly the one that you can have more of a connection with. She may be a bit greedy, but she can be really wise and she reminds Chito that the world isn\u2019t always full of tension and despair. There\u2019s always something to look forward to and you need to see more things positively. Both Chito and Yuuri make the plot of this story and I couldn\u2019t ask for more. Their opposites attract, and it makes watching this anime just amazing, especially when it gets meaningful and emotional.\\n\\n\r\n\tI really want to point out how beautiful the soundtrack is to this anime. Some tracks are quite sad and depressing, and some are really, really happy. However, the part that really stands out the most for me is how each of the tracks sound. It\u2019s a beautiful and unique soundtrack, and I haven\u2019t heard such an amazing soundtrack since Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica and Made in Abyss. The passion used to make this original soundtrack is just beyond my own comprehension, because it sounds perfect in my ears. Kenichiro Suehiro took many different elements of music and combined them to make the soundtrack for this anime, and he did it near flawlessly. The soundtrack is used so precisely on the perfect moments and it makes the vibe of each part of the anime feel so good. Whenever Chito and Yuuri are in a dark area, a more calm or eerie song plays. Whenever they discover something amazing or they look out into the distance and see the beauty of the layered city, a song that will make the scene so much more emotional plays. That\u2019s what I love about this OST, it\u2019s just perfect to me.\\n\\n\r\n\tThis anime is so powerful even after a first time watch. I want to rewatch this so many times, I bet won\u2019t ever get tired of seeing how amazing this is. The meaning behind Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou probably goes far beyond what I feel like it already is. This anime is such a rare find today that there\u2019s almost nothing like it, even now. This may just be one of the most unique anime ever made and I appreciate White Fox for it. The amount of time and dedication to make this anime amazing is beautiful. I felt happiness, sadness, emotional connections, and all the meaningfulness from this show just go right into my head, never to come back out because it\u2019s so worth it to keep these memories in my head after watching this. The complexity of Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou is so deep that maybe even if I watched 10 times I couldn\u2019t find out the true meaning. I just stick to what I think it\u2019s about and I\u2019m happy that I think of it that way because it makes the viewing experience so much more enjoyable. There hasn\u2019t been a single anime like this one that I\u2019ve watched before and it\u2019s the most unregrettable and unforgettable experience I have ever had watching anime. My opinion may be biased compared to most, but I felt too many great emotions when watching this.\\n\\n\r\nShoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou is my favourite anime.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10+/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 10+/10\\n\r\nArt: 10+/10\\n\r\nSound: 10+/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10+/10\\n\r\nOverall: 10+/10",

            "content": "Let me make it clear that I will now write a lot about how this anime left me feeling, and reasons for it... Reasons for why many people like myself like this show so much...\r\n[There will probably be quite heavy spoilers]\r\nSo let me begin with saying that this show really left me feeling with the \"void\" feeling after finishing it, the type of feeling of... seeing something so true (if that makes any sense). It goes over some very dark ideas throughout the whole series which might at first be quite apparent but there's way more if one cares to delve deeper.\r\nIn the show weare shown what only seems to be a destroyed world far into the future, not a single type of plant or animals are still alive and at no point in the show do we see foliage of any kind, instead, we see the world covered in metal presumably to make it easier to live on for humans, to basically, create a \"perfect\" home for those living on it. Of course the dreams of life are rarely no more and with great cities destroyed the way it is in the show, it becomes almost impossible to live.\\n\\n\r\nI think one important part of the show that I feel makes a lot of people like it, is duo to how mysterious it is. We aren't really told what destroyed the planet more than subtle hints every now and then and it really never explain things in the story, yet even though this is true, it feels like everything has a reason, it feels like everything has a backstory that makes sense. They've created a world that seems so believable it might as well be our earth.\\n\\n\r\nBy having such rare encounters with people in the series, it creates something I don't think I've almost ever seen in a different show... It's the feeling of isolation in a world were millions and billions of people once roamed the earth. This creates not specifically a suspension each type they meet a new person, but almost as if a new hope, something which the 2 main characters seem to lack more and more the more they go on.\\n\\n\r\nAlso when speaking about lack of hope, Yuuri, one of the main characters, keeps singing a tune about no hope, but she doesn't sing it in a way that's specifically sad but almost as if happy and cheerful. I think it's quite obvious to say that she isn't \"happy\" with everything being the way it is now, but more so, trying to make time pass while creating a mood. In such desperate times there's no real need to make it any worse, therefore this could be her (like we also see her do in many other ways) to try to cheer up Chito (the other main character).\\n\\n\r\nTo be completely honest, it is really hard to explain this story without seeing it with your own eyes. I've had many people tell me and other reviews say that \"literally nothing happened in the show\", which if you're one of these people I believe you misunderstood the reason this show is so loved. It's not because it very specifically gets to a goal at the end, but exactly because it doesn't. They wander the earth with basically no real confidence and hope, and that's exactly what they get.. they get a endless world filled with nothing but metallic buildings destroyed and a reminder that they too will soon enough join this rubble.\\n\\n\r\nOne show that I could say is kind of similar to this is \"Made in Abyss\", another one of the series I've given a 10 (I haven't given many shows a 10). Both aren't scared to really show how the real world is, everything doesn't always have to end well and things don't always have to coincidentally happen just so the main characters of the show can continue on a mission, this is one idea that sparks life in both of the these shows and gives them a sense of relatability.\\n\\n\r\nI find myself often listening back to the songs from the series, for example the opening, the opening itself has quite a happy tone, yet each time I listen to it, I almost shed a tear, remembering the greatness which is this show, it means more to me than I could possibly convey.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is easily a 10/10 for me, in fact I'd like to give it a higher score. If you haven't seen this show (then sorry for spoiling some basics of it, but you will certainly still enjoy it) then you really should check it out! \"Don't watch anime with your eyes closed\"",

            "content": "Two chibi girls on a vintage Kettengrad motorbike explore the war-ravaged city that they once called home. This sentence without context sounds ridiculous, but Girls' Last Tour manages to pull it off by providing one of the best shows of the season  with beautiful background imagery, variation between the two leads that mimic those of two sides of a brain, and a soothing yet melancholic soundtrack\r\nThe quality of the backgrounds can be mostly attributed to the widely used post-apocalyptic setting and the source material of the show. Tsukumizu's elaborate ruined cityscapes of rusted pipes and war-torn steel fully contrast with the two chibi, moeleads.\\n\\n\r\nChito and Yuuri compose the dual leads that this anime relies on to contrast it's grim setting. If you were to divide the two into the halves of a brain, Chi would be the intellectual right and Yu would be the cheery left. Both care immensely for each other, as seen in the show, and operate almost as one conscious entity. The very design of our two main characters is the antithesis of this show's setting of a post-apocalypse, something that has been done in other shows such as Made in Abyss. The interactions the two have with each other can only be described as nostalgic, and the soundtrack of this show furthers this by a significant margin.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is very well supplemented with acoustic guitar and vocals among other instruments and is often used to evoke a sense of discovery or nostalgia as the two girls venture throughout the city. The warmth of the guitar clashes with the frigid concrete, providing another point of divergence that fuels the nostalgia train. \\n\\n\r\nThe technical aspect of this show is pretty impressive on its own, but the themes and thought-provoking questions that Chito and Yuuri impose upon the reader also need to be taken into consideration. They might be open-ended but hint towards a deeper learning that is happening as the two girls adventure through the wasteland. The story itself might be disconnected in some regard, but the experiences that our two leads are having could be interpreted as rediscovering what it means to be human. The episode titles contribute to this as well, with simple names like Bath or Friends. \\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, Girls' Last Tour is without a doubt the best show of this winter season, displaying an array of insightful themes with impressive execution. I hope Studio White Fox makes a second season for this gem \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Imagine you could take a step back for a moment, and take a long, hard look at humanity. Where will we be in 1,000 years? Are the issues we face in the present really that important in the grand scheme of things? What does it mean to live? If our civilisation comes to an end one day, will it really be that bad?\r\nGirl Last Tour is a unique take on post-apocalyptic fiction and in my view one of the most beautiful shows to come out in a long time. The setting might seem bleak and depressing at first glance, and whilst those feelings are present,it\u2019s mostly used as a backdrop for the talking points of the main characters. It might also seem like another Moe, slice-of-life show that has value in its cuteness and not much more, but it\u2019s really much more than that. It\u2019s an abstract journey through history and human culture through the eyes of people who never got to experience it themselves, with a perspective completely detached from our everyday lives and personal drama. It makes you think about how insignificant many of our stresses and quarrels really are in the grand scheme of things and often brings into question the meaning of why we live and do the things we do. Themes like war and human greed are brought up and criticised, just as is the importance of knowledge, keeping records and the preservation of life. In many ways this show is a harsh introspection of ourselves as a species and in many others it\u2019s an optimistic exploration of the beauty of living and learning. More than anything, it's about finding hope for the future even when the world seems bleak and empty.\\n\\n\r\nBoth the setting and characters are vehicles for the social commentary of this show, and as such don\u2019t end up being particularly interesting in themselves. There\u2019s no grand, overarching plot or a great deal in the way of character development, because that\u2019s not really the point of Girls\u2019 Last Tour. It\u2019s not a show about fictional characters, it\u2019s a show about how we think about the world and ourselves, and it works exceptionally well.",

            "content": "I've watched almost every anime listed in MAL, but this is my first time i really want to write a review here, special for this pure gem.\r\nStory: After watching so many anime of course it is so hard to find a new anime with a fresh plot. As listed in synopsys, this anime is about 2 girls journey in post apocalyptic world. What makes the story special is because of the nihilistic life lesson that the girls discuss from what they experience in their journey, meeting new things, people and even robot. \r\nCharacter: This probably what makes me falling in love with this anime becauseof the 2 main characters, Chito and Yuuri. Chito is always try to be rational even though she is so shy. And Yuuri who is so eccentric, and somehow always found a way to almost kill chito accidently. The interaction between the two is pure gem. They help each other to stay positive in the end of the world, where almost nothing is positive.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Well, i am 100% enjoy watching this anime. Even though the atmosphere if this anime is kinda dark kinda similar to Made in Abyss anime, but the Yuuri and Chito interaction always lifted the mood. They discuss heavy life lesson, such as the meaning of life, hope, happiness, and even about God, with simple thought from their experience. Even though i usually don't like philosophy anime but it doesnt really a bother for me, as they present it lightly and wrap it with comedy from Chito and Yuuri, which always give me smiles afterward.\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound:\\n\r\nI never grade an anime based on art and sound, because for me the core of anime are the plot/story and characters. \\n\\n\r\nIn term of art I think this anime is pretty good as you could even guess what is in the blurry background perfectly, even people could know the type of war weapon and machine that the duo passed in the journey. Well with the Characters moe blob design, I think this is also perfect to lift the mood and make me reminiscing Hidamari Sketch anime.\\n\\n\r\nWell, for sound I'm pretty sure this anime has best quality in this section, as I always hear people compare this anime has soundtrack as good as Made in Abyss anime, which is already famous for its soundtrack. Not to mention this anime has Inori Minase as Chito VA, Opening and Ending singer, also there is an insert song where the characters sing together with rain.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Probably the best way to describe this anime is: this is the fusion of Made in Abyss, Kino no Tabi, and Hidamari Sketch. \\n\\n\r\nOut of all anime ever made till now, this is my favorite in Slice of Life genre. This anime makes me cry and laugh, give me hope in hopelessness, and teach me that everything will be fine even though nothing is fine.\\n",

            "content": "What makes a good post-apocalyptic story?\r\nThe atmosphere. A dense and foreboding feeling that life was at one time much greater than it is today, but now all that\u2019s left is a hollow shell of a former civilization that you\u2019ll never be a part of. What makes the story of Girls' Last Tour (AKA Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou) great is not just the slice of life style plot. It\u2019s the storytelling that makes it great. \r\nAs Chito and Yuri explore the desolate city they learn more things about the setting, which in turn gives the audience useful information to piece together the setting. The world they livein is implied to be Earth in the distant future after a war has wreaked havoc then all but left the world barren. Chi and Yuu spend each episode exploring, looking for supplies, and finding new aspects to their world that they had never known before. The show implies that they were born after the war because of the director\u2019s impressive ability to tell us about the characters in subtle ways. Whether it be the way that they react to finding something that would seem normal to people like us. For example, They find a fish at one point and are only able to identify it based on distant memories. From that simple interaction, we have enough information to infer that they have never seen live fish and most likely a body of water. \\n\\n\r\nLittle details like this are all over the show. You\u2019ll constantly be learning about the world of Girl\u2019s Last Tour without a single line of exposition. \\n\r\nI was impressed from beginning to end because of the well-executed story. Girl\u2019s Last Tour understands that there\u2019s beauty in simplicity and it shows us its understanding at any chance it gets.\\n\\n\r\nThe overarching plot is relatively simple and could be categorized as a slice of life by some standards. In every episode the girls go somewhere new, they\u2019re constantly driving after all. They make pit stops at a place each episode to refuel or just to investigate a new location. We gain insight as to what Chi and Yuu know and comprehend about the world through their various pit stops. The two main characters Chi and Yu are the base of the show, if you don\u2019t like their chibi designs or their childish personalities then chances are you won\u2019t enjoy Girl\u2019s Last Tour. For me, their childish look and goofy banter between one another made the show incredibly pleasant despite taking place in a desolate post-apocalyptic world. The fact that they\u2019re able to joke about\\n\\n\r\nEven though their personalities are incredibly basic I did appreciate well defined they are. From the first episode, you\u2019ll have a good understanding of who they are and why they are the way they are. The worst issue with Girl\u2019s Last Tour (AKA; Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou) is how wildly inconsistent the characters\u2019 knowledge is. For example; in one scene Yuu says she didn\u2019t know that the Earth spun, yet in the same scene she displayed an understanding of geometry. In another scene, Karma is mentioned by the girls yet in a previous episode they had no idea what a church was\u2026 It was like the show was actively telling me to ignore all of the experience they had gone through over the course of the show. I felt like it wanted me to just embrace the characters as cute cardboard cutouts meant to be laughed at rather than studied. Throughout their journey, they meet a number of enigmatic inhabitants of the city, all of which have interesting information to provide to the girls, and the audience.\\n\\n\r\nFrequently CGI is used for the car that they drive, but the world has an undeniably arresting aesthetic. It\u2019s a bleak world with a color palette consisting of mostly black, white, brown, and grey, but there is a beauty in the lighting and plentiful use of shadows. While the visuals may not inspire as much imagination as a show like Made in Abyss does, they still tell a story. One of the best ways the director tells a story through visuals is his obsession with stairs. And I mean that in the best way possible. Every time the characters are shot climbing up in their little car there is a double meaning to the scene. The further they rise the more they learn about their world. In the very first scene of the show, the lead characters are introduced in a dark cavern driving along as they always do. By simply shooting the characters in a visually interesting factory, the director does an amazing job of establishing that the story is about these childish characters and their journey to becoming adults.\\n\\n\r\nTo complement the empty world and the mystical atmosphere is a mellow soundtrack. I do love the music, but it\u2019s really underused. Many scenes have no music at all. Just background noises that add a bit to the atmosphere and believability of the show\u2019s world. The whirr of the car engine, the clinking of metal, and the well-performed voices of Chi and Yuu are what make up much of the show\u2019s ambient sounds. Thanks to the great voice actresses of the lead characters their personalities come across really well without the show ever needing to tell us explicitly about who the characters are. The show is effortlessly enjoyable thanks to the voices. Small inflections in their voices are enough to figure out what they\u2019re thinking without requiring any unnecessary dialogue to explain things. \\n\\n\r\nI can\u2019t really complain too much that the soundtrack was underused because the best songs were saved for the best scenes. During these titular moments the melancholy soundtrack rises in volume until it becomes the only thing you can hear, it does a great job of hammering home impact of some important scenes. \\n\\n\r\nThe show lives and breathes the phrase, \u201cThe journey is more important than the destination.\u201d Even though it is a slice of life show, you\u2019re constantly being given details about the setting through Chito and Yuu as they learn more about the world on their journey. Some of the shenanigans they get into are funny. However, don't expect a comedy because it's mostly just a cute and uplifting tone that keeps it enjoyable. There are very few jokes. Which is totally fine because it would probably drain all of the tension from the moody atmosphere. \\n\\n\r\nThere's a small amount of nudity of the two girls, but it never felt leering to me. It's played off lightheartedly just like the upbeat tone of the rest of the show.\\n\\n\r\n[Final Score 8.4/10]\\n\r\nAn interesting setting and fantastic visual storytelling make Girl\u2019s Last tour immediately worth watching. Whether or not you will be immersed in the world of Girl\u2019s Last Tour depends on how interested you are in the world and journey the lead characters undergo. It\u2019s so content with simply being happy and heartwarming that I didn\u2019t feel like it was missing much. The atmosphere is dense and the mysterious setting offers something more substantial for you to chew on, which is good because I like my slice-of-life shows with at least a little bit of meaningful content.",

            "content": "In a nutshell: Girls' Last Tour is a beautiful show about two friends travelling somewhere, anywhere, in a broken world.  But even when everything is grey, bleak nothingness, Girls' Last Tour shows us that we can still somehow find joy and bliss simply by being together.  This is a fairly relaxed show.  There is no exciting plot to follow.  There is no daunting enemy that our heroes must somehow conquer with the power in their hearts.  This is a show that is much more about daily life and watching the world outside.  It is the \"sitting in a cafeon a rainy, staring out the window\" rather than the \"racing down an empty highway in a supercar\" kind of show.\\n\\n\r\nThe part I love most about Girls' Last Tour is its emotional strength. \\n\r\n Combining wonderful art, music, and voicing, it is able to conjure emotion in ways that don't need to take advantage of the usual feelings-cheap-shots.  And it doesn't just hit the usual emotional targets of sadness and happiness.  What stuck out to me is the profound sense of wonder, tragedy, and simple bliss that I got over and over again.  These are things that are usually quite hard and unusual to aim for.  It's difficult to describe, but this show yanks on my heartstrings like nothing else while not taking advantage of emotional low-blows, if that makes any sense.  However, this is not to say that this is just a serious or depressing anime.  In such a dead world, Chi and Yuu are bright lights of joy and happiness.  There's plenty of comedy as well, usually due to the antics of one character in particular.  \\n\\n\r\nStory, other than the fantastic world-building, is non-existent (and not the point).  There are really only mini-plots, but no real major plot other than the tale of the past.  (I've rated Story as 9 anyways because I'm a real sucker for mysterious world-building, even if it's only in the background)\\n\\n\r\nUsing moe chibis juxtaposed on a brutalist landscape is such an amazing contrast.  Art in the show is wonderful.  Though everything is usually grey and rectangular and sharp and mute, it actually never gets old.  The background shapes and environments are always changing.  In a way, the dullness of the world is so much more interesting than the usual fantasy/sci-fi worlds that are wild and brimming with vibrant color.  And when there is color in the world, it is used spectacularly.  Animation is also on point.  The chibi faces are put to good comedic effect.  Animated movement is simple but effective. \\n\\n\r\nMusic and sound design are, simply put, incredible.  It's hard to describe without a spoiler-ish example, but there are great combinations of songs, sound effects, and art that just put you in awe.  Voicing fits perfectly for each character, and some characters are really just enjoyable to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is a show that I cannot stop loving.  It is not action-packed.  It does not have romance.  It does not have an incredible rise of a hero against all odds.  It is a wonderful piece of slice-of-life, atmospheric, and emotional art that reminds us that anime doesn't need intense action or distressing conflict to be great.  I cannot express just how wonderful and amazing this experience is.  \\n\\n\r\nBy the way, even if you don't end up watching this, I implore you to at least listen to the OST.  Though some songs will not have the same impact without knowing the context, the score is amazing on its own.",

            "content": "Two girls takes a post-apocalyptic trip...\r\nShoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou by it's it's definition for LA was LA's zen anime for Fall 2017. \r\nShoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou follows Chito voiced by Inori Minase and Yuuri voiced by Yurika Kubo as they explore their post-apocalyptic world in a vast underground city of possibilities. Now you'd think this kind of anime would be boring but actually with the simple daily lives of Chito and Yuuri simply exploring a section of the world they live in actually gives off some platitudes about humanity itself considering the setting they are placed in.\r\nChito and Yuuri as characters are your typical characters of thestrict and methodical one of Chito while Yuuri is the laid-back character only caring about food (no seriously this becomes a running gag). Their relationship by all means are unstable but we still know they are friends through and through from a world where they are the only ones, it's given that they would want company. Now LA did say that both Chito and Yuuri are the only ones exploring their world however LA isn't being exactly correct as do indeed met remnants of civilizations if it's only two characters they met in this anime screentime. Is this a problem?, no as it delves into more world building about this underground city that both Chito and Yuuri are exploring and surviving in. \\n\\n\r\nShoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou dives into some subtle themes about humanity (and thankfully they don't hammer it in!), due to how episodic the anime is, Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou does explore even this and they do it discretely, from the simple act of rain touching empty cans making us think about music to robots clash over one another to preserve plants showing us if robots can have \"feelings\"...it's all nicely done and not at all hammered in.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation done by White Fox, the character designs do have the chibified nature to them and LA is completely ok with that, though some wouldn't. The feature when it comes to Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou are the beautiful backgrounds. LA would think the only problem to all this are the clash of chibi and gorgeous backgrounds would be annoying and actually no...it's fine showing something of a \"laid-back nature to what is showing the setting to be a depressed yet beautiful nature and counteracting the two together to actually work instead\".\\n\\n\r\nIn terms fo voice acting, there really is only two MVP and that are Inori Minase and Yurika Kubo. Fun fact, LA thought Yuuri was voiced by Ayane Sakura at first but was surprised it was Yurika Kubo...she's come a long way since Hanayo from Love Live?. Other notable surprising voice actors in this anime would go to Yuki Kaji, Kotono Mitsushi and Kana Hanazawa. The voice cast as minimal as they are, was amazing.\\n\\n\r\nOddly enough the ending to Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou tied some world building threads together and finally gave us a bit of closure as to HOW this post-apocalyptic underground city was even made, but if that's not your cup of coffee, then the ending actually showed us that Chito really cares for Yuuri as much of a pain in the ass and annoyance she was to Chito in their trip together. Either way great ending!\\n\\n\r\nWhat can LA say about Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou other than if you want a very zen anime looking at a beautifully post-apocalyptic world with two chibi explorers, then this is the anime for you.",

Before I continue however, I just want to say how masterful this show is, and why, in my opinion, is anime of the season.\r\nWith a lot of plots in anime, there is most often an end goal, a resolution that can be foreseeable. I am nowhere near someone who is truly experienced with anime, but for the reason that this show is more or so about the journey makes it really interesting.\r\nThe difference between the harsher moments and the cheerful moments almost makes the show more real. The charactersbring out important philosophical questions with just mere conversation, and the supporting characters and entities help make those points. Their ignorance of many of humanities current issues, like war, makes the viewer think of our current world and relate. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, for the characters themselves, they did an outstanding job of balancing the characters, of creating silly scenes but not overdoing it. Chito and Yuuri's contradicting personalities help blend in crucial scenes in the show and give more essence to any philosophy attempting to be presented in the show. Nuko is also really cute :3\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of art-style, I really like the blend between the scenes showing the characters and then the detail on the different pieces of technology; It helps build the contrast. The music is also really nice, and I love how they incorporated it into the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I highly recommend this if you want something fresh. I am not a fan of the Slice of Life genre, but they incorporate it here well.",

            "content": "Pros:\r\n1. Heartwarming anime\r\n2. Breathtaking music, seriously, so beautiful\r\n3. Deep philosophical meaning behind each episode concerning war \r\n4. Cute and likable cast of characters\r\nCons:\r\n1. Too Slice of Life, may be boring for some people\r\n2. Fanservice may bother some people\r\n3. Character designs too moe, may bother some people\r\n\r\nBefore Fall season even started, I have been hyping up for Girls Last Tour. This anime, at first sight while watching the PV, seemed very interesting. It takes place in a world where humans are nearly extinct because of war. There are only a few number of people left in the world including our main characters, Chito andYuuri. This anime follows their journey as they wander around the post-apocalyptic world learning about things before the world came to an end.\\n\\n\r\nAfter finishing this series, all I need to say is \"Watch this series if you want a different anime than what we got recently\". This series is extraordinary in a lot of ways. First, let's talk about the characters. Chito is your usual cute and serious female character. She can also be quite tsundere at some time, while Yuuri is a very positive character who loves eating. The contrast between these two characters are very fun to look at. Their interaction with each other are also very cute, funny and sometimes very heartwarming. \\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the sound, this is AMAZING! I'm not kidding when I say that the soundtracks are god-tier level. Such beautiful musics can't be easily found in other anime. Suehiro Kenichiro, composer for Re:Zero, might be the next Kajiura Yuki. The soundtracks are so gorgeous. I can't find any more words to describe how good the musics are. Just listen to it while watching the series. I guarantee you won't be disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have the art and animation. The designs for the characters are very moe/cute, but as a fan of this kind of designs, this doesn't bother me at all, but I've heard a lot of people complaining about it so I might as well put it here as a warning. The animation is fluid. Every scene is beautifully animated. The backgrounds are also mesmerizing, so beautiful. Praise Studio White Fox.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is a great series that you can't often find in anime. It's unique, well-executed and beautifully animated. You can see so much the staff cares about this series while watching the episode. I'll recommend this to those who like post-apocalyptic setting and moe anime. Even if you don't like those, at least give the 1st episode a try, who knows, you might end up enjoying it. That's it for my review. Thanks for reading.  :)",

            "content": "Personal Rate: 5\r\nOverall Rate based on the different criteria: 5.2 rounded down to 5\r\nWEIRD JAPANESE ANIME ALERT! Ok, this show is not for everyone... It received a lot of praises in some reviews and while I agree that the premise is interesting the show lacks in execution. When an anime is really not my thing but I consider that it would be unfair to give it a bad rate, I usually go for a 6, and the overall rate usually ends up being higher... Surprisingly that wasn't the case with Girls' Last Tour. And since I got an overall score of 5, well I choseto give it a 5 instead of my usual 6. Does it deserve such high rates ( at the time I'm typing this the overall score is 8.19 based on over 34 000 viewers)? My answer is no. Like many other shows, sometimes you get something unusual and people are quick to jump on the high rate wagon because of the uniqueness of what they're watching. So here I go, I'll be among the minority and too bad for me.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 2\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nCharacter: 4\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4\\n\r\nOverall:5\\n\\n\r\nStory: 2\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing worth of interest if the starting point. We follow Chito and Yuuri in their endless wandering through cities ravaged by war. It's not clear where these girls are going, if there are other humans or creatures or what exactly happened. Now, once this is made clear you've basically seen everything worth seeing in the show. The rest is completely episodic. Every episode consists of the girls existing their daily existence ( and yes, I'm saying existing because honestly eating rations and going from once place to the next is in no way living). Discovering a \"new place\" and taking a shower? One episode. Making bread. One Episode. Meeting somebody and parting with that somebody. One episode. And the list goes on. \\n\\n\r\nThe 2 last episodes were the only one I found truly interesting... But it was too little too late and both characters glossed over what they saw like it was inconsequential... \\n\\n\r\nFrankly I was bored senseless. I hung on because the show was recommended to me... But frankly I've seen other slices of life where things were actually happening even if overall nothing truly changed ( eg: Hyoukka, Flying Witch).\\n\\n\r\nAgain, this anime is not for everyone.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\\n\r\nPretty good... But frankly see episode 1 and go to episode 12... in terms of visuals there's not lots of effort made. Some 3D are integrated in the show, it's not subtle but it doesn't disturb the narrative. All that grey is truly depressing and man did I miss some plants, and grass and trees... The lack of it really didn't better my mood (though that's the point of the show so I obviously don't consider it a bad point).\\n\r\nAs for the character design, it's round but it does alleviate everything. If the girls were skinny and famished, It would have been difficult to finish this show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nIt's minimalist but man it is great. Honestly, that's the best part. As much as I think this show didn't live up to its interesting premise, the music fits it to a tee.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4\\n\\n\r\nChito: The mature girl.\\n\r\nYuuri: The brainless one.\\n\\n\r\nI guess the highlight for some viewers is the interactions between Chi and Yuu but frankly, Chi was alright but forgettable and Yuu was the embodiment of stupidity. No, I didn't think she was funny. On several instances her stupid behavior got on my nerves. Let's say you see a living creature different from a human for the first time in your life and that, that thing is not threatening you, you're not dying of hunger either... Are you seriously going to think that you should eat it? Worse, that \"running joke\" goes for several episodes every time a tiny opportunity occurs.\\n\\n\r\nYuuri is so senseless, and at time selfish that had I cared about them, well I would have found her infuriating.\\n\\n\r\nAnd yes, that's our ONLY characters there ( not entirely true but that's it for the mains)\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4\\n\\n\r\nI took 3 weeks to finish this show. This is definitely not bingeable and I was not eager to know what followed. Had it not have been recommended to me... I would not have bothered and would have given up at episode 3. This show is literally boredom incarnated.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\\n\r\nThis show has one merit. You know, I always thought that if men were crazy enough to make nuclear weapons fall everywhere, I would not wish to be among the survivors. Better die with the majority if there are only 10 people surviving. Humankind cannot survive which such a small gene pool anyway... and this show confirmed what I thought. Chi and Yuu's lives are truly pointless. Everything is pointless, they have no goal, no dream, no nothing. All they do is exist from one day to the next until their dying breath. Ultimately it's not like they've got a fair grasp of the memory of having a family... Well, personally it made me quite lethargic but maybe it will motivate you to move a little and enjoy the things you have when you have it. I don't know... This show could have been so much more, but ended up being something cute and aimless. Aimless and pointless but ultimately harmless.\\n\\n\r\nCan't recommend it, can't bash it totally because not my thing. I just think that the subject could have been handled differently. It was not a stupid idea... but the execution leaves a lot to be desired.\\n",

            "content": "Please note this review is intended to be read by those that have finished watching Shoujo Shuumatsu and while care has been taken to minimise spoilers there may still be spoilers within character analysis. \r\nIntro and premise \r\nIn a world devastated by war two girls embark on a journey to find the truth and along the way encounter many new lessons that adds new perspective to their lives as they see the devastated world. \r\nBased off a popular web manga of the same name Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou also better known as the Girls Last Tour is a sci-fi and mystery anime that makes use ofa premise and setting not commonly seen in the anime world which is a journey by two young girls in a world that was devastated by large-scale war that killed off much of humanity and left the few survivors to scavenge the ruins for supplies that they can use to live another day. The post-apocalyptic world setting is not one that\u2019s easily seen in animes and more commonly seen in games instead so having two girls travelling through such a world as they go on their journey was what drew me to this anime. Using the journey and the experiences and encounters that the girls encounter along the way the anime allows us to see the girl\u2019s reactions and sentiments as they see a world that while in ruins and mostly devoid of human life still provides many lessons that can be contemplated and remembered.  \\n\\n\r\nThough the world in which the anime takes place in is never quite revealed it can be seen that the world itself is an advanced one that takes the form of a tower that has many floors. Each floor has its own unique climate and theme and seems to be divided into different areas like residential or industrial. Though desolate the world also contains many survivors that have managed to survive and scavenge through weapon littered fields for gear and equipment that can be used to survive.   \\n\\n\r\nThe overall story for Shoujo Shuumatsu follows the life of two girls as they embark on a journey across the vast expanses of the world that they live and include the driver and leader the serious-minded but intelligent Chito and her partner the carefree but oddly positive soldier Yuuri who acts as Chito\u2019s second and best friend. As the girls travel across the vast expanses of the world and explore the ruins of a civilisation they encounter plenty of situations and encounters that provoke deep thought and questions in the girl's minds making them realise that the world is much larger and more complex than what they had read in the limited knowledge that they had. \\n\\n\r\nChito \\n\\n\r\nChito voiced by veteran seiyuu Inori Minase of Re Zero and Re Creators fame is one of the main characters of the series and serves as one of the main protagonists of the series. A cautious, intelligent and strict person Chito serves as the pairs overall leader and driver that directs the overall path that they take as they advance towards their goal. While a serious and strict person by nature Chito is also a level-headed and calm person that likes to have all the facts about a situation on hand before trying to determine the course of action that they should take. This is in contrast to her partner and friend Yuuri who prefers to act on impulse rather than logic. While quiet by nature Chito is shown to be a realist and is not someone that will develop high hopes for something and indeed she is one that prefers to take things slowly but cautiously accomplishing what they need to do in the less risky manner possible. An interesting personality trait of Chito\u2019s is her love of reading, learning and documenting and it can be seen that this comes from her desire to both know about the ancient world and at the same time hoping to create a record of what they had learned in their journey so that it can be used by others. As a result of this, it can be seen that Chito is someone that values knowledge and the maintaining of records and can get surprisingly angry when these are damaged.  While a soldier just like Yuuri is it can be seen that Chito is someone that is a pacifist by nature and doesn\u2019t like to use weapons even to defend herself which I found was rather strange for a soldier. While not hostile towards strangers that they encounter in the wasteland that they travel through it can be seen that Chito is someone that trusts slowly and wary of any strangers that cross their path. However, once they have proven themselves trustworthy it can be seen that she can be quite warm and trusting towards them. \\n\\n\r\nThe character of Chito I felt was an interesting character and one that was well developed and designed. In addition to serving as the one that kept the pair focused on the overall goal of the journey Chito also served as a contrast to her partner Yuuri serving as a foil that dealt with the worst of Yuuri\u2019s impulses. While her calm and cautious nature is what stops Yuuri from getting too crazy with her impulses the fact that Chito is also an avid reader and believes in seeking and recording knowledge also serves as an additional safeguard and adds charm to her character.  \\n\\n\r\nYuuri \\n\\n\r\nYuuri voiced by veteran seiyuu Yurika Kubo of Youkoso and Urara Meirochou fame is one of the main characters of the series and is Chito\u2019s partner on the journey that they are taking. A carefree, positive and happy person by nature Yuuri is someone that is the very definition of a joker as she in contrast to her partner Chito is someone that can remain optimistic even in the grimmest of situations. While Chito\u2019s serious personality often results in her causing somewhat tense situations Yuri\u2019s personality as a joker is able to balance this out by introducing a number of light-hearted moments that help defuse such situations such as building snowballs on Chi\u2019s head after a long trek and seeing snow in the morning. Unlike Chito who is well versed in both reading and writing Yuuri is someone that lacks both of those skills but is able to bounce back up due to her ability to adapt to new situations relatively quickly. While Yuuri herself can be overactive and careless at times it can be seen that beneath that happy side of her Yuuri is someone that is more perceptive than she first seems and is someone that is cautious and wary of strangers. When new situations and parties appear in their midst it can also be seen that her bond and friendship with Chito is something that she cares about greatly and values and as a result, she is fiercely protective of Chito. The character of Yuuri I felt was an interesting one as her personality contrasted a great deal with her partner Chito yet at the same time she also complemented Chito\u2019s own flaws as well. One aspect of Yuuri\u2019s personality that I particularly liked is her ability to create the most interesting and comical of questions from the most random things that she sees on her journeys something that is necessary in the long journeys that the girls go on. \\n\\n\r\nAMV \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation, I felt that the character designs for the series main characters of Chito and Yuuri were well done and reflected well on the fact that in this world fashion and style pale in comparison to ease of maintenance and functionality. The design of the girl\u2019s main form of transportation which though unnamed in the series I felt was interesting as it looked like a combo of a bike and a tractor and as a result allowed them to travel along many different types of terrain quite easily. The various terrain that the girls travel through as they go about their journey though I felt was well developed and designed though as each level and area that they go through was unique in terrain and theme and featured unique challenges that the girls had to overcome as they encounter it. The music for the series I felt was pretty good and the background music did well to complement the different situations that the girls encounter along the way. The opening and ending themes of the series, I felt were also well done with the former being catchy and funny and symbolising positive thinking and the latter symbolising optimism. The voice acting for the series was strong and I felt that despite the lack of an effective backstory that Inori Minase and Yurika Kubo who voiced the main leads of Chito and Yuuri respectively did an excellent job of portraying their characters and showing the unique interaction that exists between them when they are exploring. \\n\\n\r\nOverall conclusion \\n\\n\r\nIn overall Shoujo Shuumatsu was an interesting anime that had among its main strong points an interesting premise, interesting story, character interaction and excellent voice acting. Though the premise of a post-apocalyptic world is rare by anime standards it is not unheard off but the concept of a journey in which two young girls explore the wasteland as part of their quest to reach their objective was one that drew my attention to it. The overall story of the series while thin along the lines of what their overall quest was still managed to accomplish the task of expanding upon the wasteland and developing the girl\u2019s characters by introducing various situations and events that the girls encounter along the way. Each of these situations and events while not overly dramatic and indeed rather simple also did well to introduce us to the state of the world that the girls live in as well as provoke some interesting theories and opinions that the girls express. The fact that knowledge about this world is so few and far between also serves to enhance this process as neither girl knows about the things that they can encounter along the way and as a result, their opinion and theories are based on their personalities instead which makes every event and encounter interesting to see.  The fact that these feature many different themes I felt also served to enhance this.  Within the series there are many examples of simple things that we take for granted that no one no longer knows exists such as music, camera\u2019s, elevators and watching the main characters reactions as they encounter this and be amazed by it also serves to remind us just how much this world has lost to the fires of war. The interactions between the two main characters I felt was also one of the strong points to the series as between the situations and events that the characters encounter are many quiet moments and seeing the conversations that take place between the two as they head on to the next encounter I felt was funny and refreshing and helped greatly by the fact that these conversations can start from the most random of topics that can create the most interesting of answers. The atmosphere of each of the episodes as the girls explore the various areas that they encounter I felt was also well done and helped convey a sense of loneliness to the world that harmonises well with the setting.  \\n\\n\r\nIn overall Shoujo Shuumatsu was an anime that while having an interesting premise and characters expanded upon its greatest weakness, which was its weak story by introducing events and situations that the girls meet along the way that featured a surprisingly large number of themes and questions and answers that were also surprisingly deep and well thought out that resonated well with this world that the girls live in where knowledge is rare and precious. In terms of final score, I think this anime will deserve a final score of 9/10. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Strolling through a grey and barren wasteland, two girls are on a journey. Rations are their only food, each other's company their only comfort and a Kettenkrad motorbike and a protect rifle their only partners. This is a story about a post-apocalyptic future, cultures lost in war and appreciating the little things in life.\r\nFew future settings display the thoughtfulness present in Girl\u2019s Last Tour: war has, multiple times, left its mark on Earth and humanity. The numerous layers of the forsaken and metallic city tell tales of many civilizations long gone; their technology gradually grows more sophisticated and the cityscape more complex by the layer.Their different religious beliefs, or lack thereof, as well as their different perceptions of beauty are ingrained in them: some show idealistic symmetry spread evenly throughout, others are dominated by religious symbols resembling a progressed Christianity. However, their god seems more like an alien creature possibly playing a central role in mankind\u2019s long history of war\u2026\\n\\n\r\nThe themes and background of the show allow for contemplation and its war-ridden lands give ground for cynical criticism of war, but Girl\u2019s Last Tour is not at all about nihilism, the cruelty of war or the dangers of technological advancement. With overpowering optimism and gratitude for life, it avoids dwelling on many of its philosophically potent and open-ended questions through the sheer simplicity of its appreciation for the here and now; there is solace in solitude and beauty in company.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s hard not to get swept up in the show\u2019s pensive mood, but it is near impossible not to fall in love with the protagonists' fun antics: Yuuri and Chito have amazing chemistry and partaking in their intimacy is a truly soothing experience. The two share a heartwarming bond of love and trust and remind one of simpler days; to take the role of an onlooker is to embrace a heartwarming nostalgia.\\n\\n\r\nChito is the duo\u2019s brain: she is literate and reliable. Over the years, she has learned to work around Yuuri\u2019s shortcomings and deal with her eccentricities. At times, her diplomatic mindset clashes with Yuuri\u2019s air-headedness. However, she has no issue striking back should it get overbearing, for she knows it\u2019s the only way to get through to her dense companion.\\n\\n\r\nIn comparison, Yuuri might at first seem like an unpleasant person. She is a glutton, unreliable and at parts overbearingly annoying - but actually a very caring individual. She keeps looking out for Chito and ensures her safety, she is sorry when Chito is hurt and does her best to express her guilt. It is not only her shortcomings that need to be worked around: her partner has serious fear and submits to panic at the blink of an eye. Fortunately, Yuuri always stays supportive of her.\\n\\n\r\nRusty pipe systems, snow-clad plains filled with weapons of war and desolate temples - the show\u2019s landscape is empty and its designs range from simple to highly complex. The dark, barely saturized, grey color palette only changes during dreams and revelations. Unlike one might initially assume, the empty and wistful world radiates a romantic feeling. While it may be devoid of nature and has no ecosystem to speak of, the countless tales told by the cityscape itself more than make up for it. The bubbly moe character designs help alleviate the central juxtaposition of the cold world and the comforting company of the two protagonists (and whomever they might meet along the way).\\n\\n\r\nSuch sparse environment rarely allows for much movement to take place, but through dosated usage of CG the show enables engaging camerawork and alleviates the overall experience. The CG itself does unfortunately not hold up to the gorgeous and detailed look of the hand-drawn backgrounds but it in turn allows the explosive scenes to benefit from the momentum achievable through animation - and they look great!\\n\\n\r\nThe show\u2019s solid visuals are accompanied by both upbeat and melancholic music. In insert songs, the vocalist creates a great feeling of departure encompassing an euphoric mood and a grieving goodbye. On the other hand, the Opening and Ending songs excel through their sheer musical simplicity. They embrace modern electronic music and pop culture (the moonwalk and even dabbing), depicting and enhancing the fun shenanigans of the two girls and their endless journey.\\n\\n\r\nDue to its metallic landscape, the soundscape of the show mostly consists of industrial sounds: petrol engines, gunfire and cold, metallic echoes dominate, and their prevalence is only trumped by the two girls\u2019 dialogue.\\n\\n\r\nGirls\u2019 Last Tour is lighthearted and emotionally poignant; it excels through simplicity and thoughtfulness, but never dwells on the latter. The juxtaposition of its thematically dense but desolate cityscape and the intimacy of the main duo create a melancholically wholesome experience and make it one of the best shows of the year.\\n\\n\r\nScore: 85\\n",

            "content": "Ok, so it seems like i am the only guy in this entire site that didn't like this show (at least in the review section), so i fell the need to write why this show is so terrible.\r\nAlso, this is my first review in the site and i'm not a native english speaker, so sorry if the structure of this review seems garbage to you.\r\nFirstly, i want to say that i was very excited to see this show when it came in the seasonal chart, i didn't know how it whould be, but even if it was just a generic slice of life show, itwould be interesting just by the premise, bonus it was made by White Fox, that is one of my favorite studios.\\n\\n\r\nWhat i got was really dissapointing: a show about literelly nothing, most of the show is just these two girls walking and visiting some unisteressing place, and that is it, i wouldn't have a problem with that if the show had something interssing that could haddle it to be entertaining, but... what this show have of entertaining?\\n\\n\r\nStory? None of it, most of the show is episodic and there is barely any worldbuilding. Good comedy? Nah, there is barely any comedy at all and the few jokes are just Chito punching Yuu. Cute girls suffering shit? Meh, the girls act like the fact that they are the last two humans in the entire earth are just normal business. Some philosophic and 2deep4u shit? Nope, none of the stories have any meaning at all.\\n\\n\r\nNot saying that a anime MUST do some of these things to be good, these are just some ideas of things that Shuumatsu could do to be at least enterteining, but shuumatsu does none of it and does nothing that i didn't say too, it's just two girls living, nothing is fun, must of the stories barelly have a conflict, nothing has any purpose at all, everything is just a great piece of nothing.\\n\\n\r\nAnd bonus, this show is slow as hell, it drags a in a lot of things just to fill that 23 minutes mark, like bake a loaf for entire 2 minutes or take 3 minutes with a montage that is pure filler, and all those facts combined result in to the most boring show in this entire year, i think i could not watch it all if i didn't watch it weekly, cause must of the time i was just waiting for the episode end so i could do something better.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that could have saved this show would have good characters to handle the boredom, but that brings in another problem that is the characters are more bland then a piece of paper, they're uncharismatic, boring and do not stand out, and this wouldn't be a problem in a normal show, but this are the ONLY 2 characters in the entire show, you can't just be this lazy and expect the viewer to give a shit about then in this way.\\n\\n\r\nI could also talk why this ending is forced and totally garbage, but spoilers are agains't the Review Guidelines, so if you want to know, ask in my comments.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, this show is just a waste of premise and it's a shame that such talented people did work in this, i hope WF give us a better work next time.",

            "content": "Imagine you\u2019re trekking into a dense forest with your friends. The sun is going down and it\u2019s getting late. Then, you hear strange unknown noises coming from all directions around you. You check your phone and it has no signal. You can\u2019t find the compass in your pocket and there\u2019s no food left. Now, you and your friends just realized\u2026you\u2019re lost. You\u2019re in trouble.\r\nI don\u2019t know how many of you have been in this type of situation before but watching Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou brings a similar feeling. The idea of being lost in an unknown place evokes a sort of uneasiness. The constant fear ofdanger, feeling restless, and hoping to survive is what really attracted me to this show. To me, Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou (Girls\u2019 Last Tour) is much more than just a world-end journey. It\u2019s a show that combines slice of life with post-apocalyptic themes for the sake of survival. Do they need a reason beyond that? Not really. Yet, it doesn\u2019t really need more to sell its masterful storytelling.\\n\\n\r\nTo be clear, this anime takes place in the aftermath of a vague apocalyptic event. What do I mean by vague? It basically means that the anime doesn\u2019t fully explain the details of what happened in the past. It only leaves behind details with places, objects, and symbols that characters will discover. In the meantime, this anime does a solid job at world building. Essentially, their world is dead. It\u2019s devoid of almost all life. What\u2019s interesting to note is that the structures, gadgets, and weapons looks realistic enough to relate to our world. These range from food factories, libraries, tall towers, and among others. Even some of the weapons that appears in the show looks realistic such as the guns and iconic tank that the two characters operate. Throughout this anime, we can only interpret the various mysteries of their world. To be honest, that\u2019s what makes it intriguing. The anime doesn\u2019t give true answers and leaves the viewers to theorize with their own imaginations. \u201cWhat happened to this world?\u201d is a big question mark I\u2019m sure most viewers will formulate throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re invested into a linear storytelling of complexity, turn back now. This show isn\u2019t to please a certain demographic but instead relies on its creativity to do the storytelling. Every episode is an adventure of its own as Chito and Yuuri makes new discoveries during their journey. At times, it almost feels like playing an open world game like Assassin\u2019s Creed Origins or Fallout. The vast open world of unknown leaves behind so much to explore and honestly, it\u2019s what bought the most interest for me. From cultural symbols to mysterious ruins, it\u2019s a show that carries itself without a plot doing the talking. Our two heroines, Chito and Yuuri walk the earth without an end goal and it\u2019s dazzling at how much interest they bring in.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, Chito and Yuuri are the main characters that ultimately connects the show together. Without these two, there wouldn\u2019t be a journey. Watching Chito and Yuuri together really shows that the two has a unique relationship. Chito\u2019s calm composure balances out Yuuri\u2019s easygoing personality and two makes a dynamic approach to their survival. For instance, Chito has the skill to drive Kettenkrad (their spider-like tank). She\u2019s the one usually making decisions thanks to her literate skills. On the other hand, Yuuri has the knowledge to operate firearms, a skill essentially for their survival. The two make an interesting team in that although they don\u2019t always agree, they\u2019re able to collaborate to survive. However, a big part that attracted me about the duo is their character chemistry. There really isn\u2019t many characters in this show so watching these two connect really brings the best out of each other. There are episodes that show their imaginative creativity and make the most of their situation. Despite their current condition, Chito and Yuuri enjoys each other\u2019s company and even has fun when the opportunities present itself. Their small talk is also meaningful that even includes some philosophical dialogues from time to time. Still, this show does introduce a few characters although they only make sparse appearances. Kanazawa and Ishii are human beings that our main duo will encounter. Their encounter with them brings an interesting side and provokes a question such as \u201care there others like them out there?\u201d Their role in the show is also interesting to note as they help each other to survive while accomplishing their own goals. Later on in the show, there\u2019s also another character introduced although it swings into the otherworldly category. \\n\\n\r\nYou would think a show like this is about despair and sadness. No. If you take notice, you can easily discover that Chito and Yuuri lives their daily lives happily. Their journey takes them to ruined cities as they scavenge for supplies. They even hope to make memories from this journey with the help of a camera. Additionally, there are episodes that puts these two into ludicrous positions such as being drunk. I can also honestly confess that the show is emotionally appealing on different levels. Chito and Yuuri\u2019s relationship give the impression that no matter how desolate a world can be, there\u2019s hope and joy. Adapting a show like this really takes skill and I am very impressed by the craft the creators applied. As a manga reader, I\u2019m also glad that the anime captured the mood of the show throughout each episode. It\u2019s mostly faithful and really does a solid job at selling its ideas.\\n\\n\r\nWhite Fox has been experimenting with a variety of genres recently. To make this anime really needed effort as adapting a desolate world is no easy task. Thankfully, I can say that they did a stellar job at adapting the visual quality of the show. The atmospheric feel really hits the marks with designs of the city ruins, cultural objects, and even weapons. Kettenkrad is a tank that people can relate to our modern world while the weapons such as rifles are visually realistic. The most interesting part is perhaps the character designs of Chito and Yuuri. The two look like characters from a cartoon. Some viewers might not be too keen on accepting them but it should be recognized that they are more complex than they appear. This is expressed through their character expressions. There\u2019s no succinct way to put it but the two really draws a line between abnormal and normalcy. Their expressions evoke emotions from laughter, sadness, and curiosity. To note, there\u2019s also some fan service but viewers should overlook that as those parts stand as a foil to the despair of this desolate world. You\u2019d think these girls would be dressed like they are child soldiers read to go to war but in reality, they just live life.\\n\\n\r\nI can\u2019t say this enough but the soundtrack is stunningly beautiful. Music composer Kenichiro Suehiro shows his craft through the simplistic yet very convincing OST for this show. The melancholic tone with the eerie vibe every episode gives off matches perfect with the setting. Not to mention, I\u2019m also impressed by the avant-garde style of the theme songs. It\u2019s unique with a catchy tone that\u2019s hard to miss. Finally, praise should be given to the two main heroines. It only took one episode to convince myself that Chito and Yuuri\u2019s voices matches perfectly with their personalities.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve watched this show several times during its duration and it still feels like I only scratched the surface. Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou is a rare anime that took on a peculiar premise and turned it into a near masterpiece. It has the ability to get viewers invested without an overlaying plot. The characters are deceptively complex. With a world setting filled with mystery, it\u2019s no wonder you can find yourself lost. Don\u2019t worry though. It won\u2019t be like one of those trekking trips where you get drenched in fear. No, it\u2019s a show that breathes life into such a post-apocalyptic world.",

            "content": "We can be in the presence of a deja-vu, an anime about children (I used that words before).  Could it surprise us as Made in the Abyss did? Will we feel empathy with those kids in a post-apocalyptic world? The truth is that we can be surprised one more time. \r\nWe live our lives hastily surrounded by numerous technological devices. We consider that our daily tasks, such as eating and taking a shower, are \"habitual,\" and we never asked ourselves what would happen if life change due to destruction and a terrible war. What would happen if we lose those things? What would wedo to survive? Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou takes us to a time where civilization disappeared because of war. The only memory of the existence of the culture lies in the numerous ruins of cities and the devices that once served humans. The animation captivates us with an incredible story of friendship, trust and the constant struggle to survive. Day after day the actions of two girls are a ray of hope in a desolate world.\\n\\n\r\nThe story 9\\n\\n\r\nThe world is a hostile, challenging and sometimes somber place. The constant struggle between nations led to chaos and destruction where countless lives were lost. The war took to oblivion the meaning of the civilization that once existed. The bonds of this condemned world are reflected in the few survivors who day after day must be scavengers to obtain a supply that can prolong their existence in a dead world and thus give meaning to their lives\\n\\n\r\nTwo girls, Chito and Yuuri, wander in the middle of the solitude, the ruins and the deteriorated structures of what was once a society. In the same way, they struggle to find their daily sustenance. A simple ration bar could be a treasure, a place to bathe would be a longed-for dream. In summary, all the dreams changed for the constant struggle to survive. Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou's story has an incredible context that could make you remember writings from Martin Heidegger and Jean-Paul Sartre that talk about human existentialism. In the same way, the story leads this duo to question about life, death and human nature. \\n\\n\r\nThese girls have dreams, feelings, fears that are exposed in each episode and are perceived by the spectators. They transform a simple rain into a musical festival and maintain a high level of optimism that we can observe in the various actions, games, and jokes that they make throughout the plot. However, you can ask yourself if one day you will find an answer to what happened to the world and if these girls will live long enough to grow and have a happy life if there is one.\\n\\n\r\nThe setting of Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou is excellent. The anime portrays the scars of a war that happened a while ago. Abandoned buildings, rusty pipelines that vanish in the shade as the last sign of life and in the midst the survivors. Elements such as the environment show the catastrophic scenario that these girls have to endure in order to survive day after day. Maybe those details add more realism to the story.\\n\\n\r\nSomething you can notice is the constant need to move, climb and reach higher levels. We can compare that world with a spiral without an apparent end. What will they find in the higher levels? What difficulties will appear? Moreover, the world is full of mysteries, one of them is the reason for the war, another the \"statues\" that arise during the adventure that perhaps are part of a higher purpose and a camera that keeps the records of the lost memories. \\n\\n\r\nThe most exciting part is how the information is delivered to the viewers. The story advances with these girls and the audience advances with them. The viewer is an active part of the story since it depends on these girls and is not a simple observer. The story has good pacing it has a lovely narrative that will keep you hooked until the end. \\n\\n\r\nSometimes, for a lot of spectators is difficult to sympathize with children or to find an animation about children engaging. However, this duo maintains the innocence of their age no matter what problems they have had. They still act like little girls in a devastated world. Yes, I know that, under certain circumstances, they must make decisions as adults, but I liked that they still have dreams, that they question everything and that they want to discover new things. In other words, they are not adults, Chito and Yuuri still have a childhood to live. For example, I will always remember when Yuuri tried to draw Chito in the diary. That kind of moments matches the innocence and youth of the characters that sooner or later will have to mature. Finally, the series highlights several ideas such as friendship, trust, the need to be together to survive. What would they do if one of them were in danger near death? \\n\\n\r\nPitifully, the story does not conclude entirely. Maybe we will need to wait some time to see a full conclusion. However, the final episode could give you a partial completion where the emotions (sadness, love) were present. It will reveal some mysteries and facts that we were suspecting.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9\\n\\n\r\nThe most delightful couple of the season. Chito and Yuuri could be very different, but they care for each other. Moreover, they are in a constant fight to survive, but they maintain the innocence of a child that isn't corroded by the war or any other event. \\n\\n\r\nChito. She is the brain of the group, she takes smart decisions but also is very fragile and has some fears. She likes to read and writes a journal. Also, she keeps the duo working for a higher cause, surviving or maybe feeding Yuuri. \\n\\n\r\nYuuri. She is the muscle and the comedian of the group also is a good shooter. You can see her as Chito's guardian. Her humor is fantastic she can make us forget about that desolated world with her actions and jokes. For example, it was hilarious when Chito comment to Kanazawa \"she burns others books,\" and Yuuri's expression was pretty amusing.  \\n\\n\r\nArt 8\\n\\n\r\nEach episode offers excellent detail and artistic quality. However, some CGI can be observed in some camera angles (mostly on the Kettenkrad motorbike), but they are not so strange and do not damage the narrative. Also, the series has an intelligent use of lighting. You can feel that the world is gone. The light is contrasted each scene showing the designs where the decadent world (rusty pipes), abandoned machinery, weapons. The camera angles used in the scenes are correct and keep the eyes occupied in the critical parts of the narrative and the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters' design is not very detailed. Moreover, they are a bit simple, they follow a chibi art, for some persons they have a mocking style, but I liked it in general, and it helps to have a better idea of \u200b\u200bthe personalities of the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is pretty amazing. I am a bit amazed by the score; it can compete with Made in the Abyss. Also, the track rises the climax of each episode. For example, the central theme (Episode 1, Ending) adds the concept of mystery and innocence to the story. The sound mix is excellent, you can feel with your senses the desolation and the ruins because the sound boosts the ambiance and the characters actions. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP is very catchy, has a constant rhythm where you can see some traits of the main characters, and it has interesting lyrics. About the ED, it isn't as good as the OP but in general is a good song. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9\\n\\n\r\nIn each episode, I expected to see answers to some mysteries, and I was waiting for what this pair would find. I wanted to follow the story. However, maybe the plot has some problems since we will not have all answers to all questions and there is no real ending that reveals us the future of this unique duo because the manga is still in progress. No matter this issue I liked how this pair acted and tried to find answers to philosophical questions such us life and death, and the reason for the existence.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9\\n\\n\r\nShoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou was a surprise. In my case, I want to see the answers to the mysteries, I want to understand more about what happened to that desolate world and, above all, I want to see if these girls will survive the adventure in this world. Unfortunately, I'll have to wait a while for that, and I'm sure you will have similar feelings towards this magnificent story because you will see it regardless of my recommendation.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Girls' Last tour should've and would've been boring as hell if this exact team didn't make it. I know you don't think of Studio White Fox when you think of cute girls, even though they did Is The Order A Rabbit?, because they're most famous for thrillers like Steins;Gate and more recently Re:Zero. That said, they pulled this off near perfectly.\r\nWhen I was first told about this show, it was said the manga was flat out boring. It was said Girls' Last Tour had no depth and was the stereotypical cute girls doing cute things with nothing to it type of thing. I think theexact words were, \"Your not going to get another Mushishi or anything,\" as that show is quite renowned as the peak of intellectual slice of life shows. When I went back to read some of the manga a week ago, I found out that they weren't wrong about the manga, it's just the adaptation was so good you never could've guessed how this manga evolved into it.\\n\\n\r\nEverything about this world feels alive. Both our main characters are so full of personality and feel so real to me. If you think Chi is going to be the straight man while Yuu is the genki with nothing more to it then you're so painfully wrong. Their characters have so much depth of writing, and while their backstory isn't explained to the extent I would've liked, it doesn't even matter because you see them develop over the course of the show such that a backstory to explain who they are is simply unnecessary. And don't even get me started on their chemistry. How can a show with basically TWO characters be this human and entertaining?! Their interactions are so funny when they want to be and serious when they have to be. The tone shifts naturally and the writing goes with it, which allows the show to fully commit to any emotion it want to convey.\\n\\n\r\nI'd also like to praise the animation and sound design. This might be a bit of a stretch here, but the show I can most closely relate to Girls' Last Tour in these categories is Kill la Kill. The animation isn't Kyoto Animation level of perfection and stunning flawlessness; it's more of Trigger's fun, poppy, not too serious animation that really lets the personality and style of the show stand out over mere technical impressiveness. That's not to insult the professionals who take their craft seriously, it's simply to say this type of show needed to let itself loose to capture the feeling that it did for me. The score and sound design are totally perfect and inventive in ways a most creators would never even think of. Sound effects will break out into song, and already well integrated songs will inform the themes. So many scenes are amazing concepts with equally amazing execution, and they are so on the strength of the sound design and OST alone. I simply think you should go listen to it and get entranced with the emotions like me and many others did. Again, this show's score and sound design are perfect; it captivates you exactly as it needed to.\\n\\n\r\nYet again, the slice of life genre is a masterpiece. If you're looking for some hardened men, killer action sequences, mind breaking cliffhangers, brutal action sakuga, and most importantly NO MOE, then this is certainly not for you, but if you're looking for literally anything else, I promise Girls' Last Tour will have something to say to you as it did to me. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading.",

            "content": "Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou - Series Review\r\n\tWhat if there really was a world where you and your very best friend were supposedly the only two people left in the world after a post-war society? How would that feel, being with the one and only person you ever wanted to be with until you die, experiencing hardships, connections, good times, and everything in between? Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou gives me an idea of how that would feel and for some reason that idea has kept popping back up in to my head. You and your friend are just lost in what seems like an endless \u201csandbox world\u201d toyourselves, maybe even seeing people along the way. There\u2019s always that tense feeling of not knowing what you will see next or what\u2019s waiting for you in the near or distant future. Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou may not be seen as the best anime series ever by most people, but to me, I felt a connection. A connection with the environment, the characters, and the dialogue\u2026 everything. I want to explain why this is my favourite series of all time without being biased. This is all my opinion, and I hope that you can understand why this is the best anime I have watched as of the time I have made this review.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe story is set in stone right from the first episode. Chito and Yuuri are supposedly the last two people left in society, maybe even the last living organisms in society. Everyday they rely on what they learned from what they found the day before. They are always finding new things to discover, and the show really pulls you in from what they find each episode. In this post-war apocalyptic environment, you\u2019d expect quite a melancholy of a story if anything, with the whole story being about how the last two people left in the world only have the small things that are ahead of them to look forward to. That\u2019s not the case for Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou. In fact, Chito and Yuuri\u2019s journey is fairly merry and joyful. Most of the experiences that are bad overshadow the good because of how short the bad moments last. It makes this show much more enjoyable and shows that all the sad moments in life should only last such a small amount of time, and you should only focus on the best parts of it. That\u2019s what I love about this show. Maybe you have depression, and you really connected with this show. That\u2019s basically the same case for me; I think that this show tells you that even if life is hard at times, nice things still happen, and you should shift your focus on those nice things. Then, your life will be much happier. Chito and Yuuri had left their parents from a society that seems to have no backstory other than that, making it raise a lot of questions and makes this anime more mysterious as it goes on. Who knows what could have happened to that society besides the fact that it was most likely torn down by war? To be honest, anime that propose a question or have mystery elements to them are some of my favourite aspects of anime in general.\\n\\n\r\n\tWhite Fox is known for being really experimental with what they make and they always love to reach out to new genres. They have made a lot of amazing anime and I appreciate how hard they work on making things perfect. Steins;Gate was an amazing anime for me and it\u2019s honestly unforgettable. They also made some other really great series like Katanagatari, Akame ga Kill, Re:Zero, Gochuumon wa Usagi desu ka, Hataraku Maou-sama, and probably more. Of course, Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou adds to the amount of great series they have made. Their way of adapting Tsukumizu\u2019s art style was perfect and it feels like Tsukumizu could have even made the anime herself if she could. The landscape and scenery stand out a ton in many episodes and attention to detail in scenes that need to be pointed out as the most important parts are absolutely stellar, hell, maybe I can even call it flawless. I have this attachment to how cute the style of the characters are and it makes me happy everytime I see them. White Fox just did really good at making this anime adaptation and I\u2019m so glad they did.\\n\\n\r\n\tChito and Yuuri are characters that feel real in a way that makes it very relatable to many people. They are almost like opposites to each other, and their interactions display many different emotions and they clearly are happy that they are together in this end of the world society. It makes me wonder how it would feel like if me and my best friend were in a society quite like the one in Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou. Chito is the character that worries a lot about what\u2019s ahead and does repairs to the Kettenkrad. She seems to be a lot more of a survivalist than Yuuri is, but her personality is really adorable. Yuuri is the carefree and happy go lucky character, and honestly the one that you can have more of a connection with. She may be a bit greedy, but she can be really wise and she reminds Chito that the world isn\u2019t always full of tension and despair. There\u2019s always something to look forward to and you need to see more things positively. Both Chito and Yuuri make the plot of this story and I couldn\u2019t ask for more. Their opposites attract, and it makes watching this anime just amazing, especially when it gets meaningful and emotional.\\n\\n\r\n\tI really want to point out how beautiful the soundtrack is to this anime. Some tracks are quite sad and depressing, and some are really, really happy. However, the part that really stands out the most for me is how each of the tracks sound. It\u2019s a beautiful and unique soundtrack, and I haven\u2019t heard such an amazing soundtrack since Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica and Made in Abyss. The passion used to make this original soundtrack is just beyond my own comprehension, because it sounds perfect in my ears. Kenichiro Suehiro took many different elements of music and combined them to make the soundtrack for this anime, and he did it near flawlessly. The soundtrack is used so precisely on the perfect moments and it makes the vibe of each part of the anime feel so good. Whenever Chito and Yuuri are in a dark area, a more calm or eerie song plays. Whenever they discover something amazing or they look out into the distance and see the beauty of the layered city, a song that will make the scene so much more emotional plays. That\u2019s what I love about this OST, it\u2019s just perfect to me.\\n\\n\r\n\tThis anime is so powerful even after a first time watch. I want to rewatch this so many times, I bet won\u2019t ever get tired of seeing how amazing this is. The meaning behind Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou probably goes far beyond what I feel like it already is. This anime is such a rare find today that there\u2019s almost nothing like it, even now. This may just be one of the most unique anime ever made and I appreciate White Fox for it. The amount of time and dedication to make this anime amazing is beautiful. I felt happiness, sadness, emotional connections, and all the meaningfulness from this show just go right into my head, never to come back out because it\u2019s so worth it to keep these memories in my head after watching this. The complexity of Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou is so deep that maybe even if I watched 10 times I couldn\u2019t find out the true meaning. I just stick to what I think it\u2019s about and I\u2019m happy that I think of it that way because it makes the viewing experience so much more enjoyable. There hasn\u2019t been a single anime like this one that I\u2019ve watched before and it\u2019s the most unregrettable and unforgettable experience I have ever had watching anime. My opinion may be biased compared to most, but I felt too many great emotions when watching this.\\n\\n\r\nShoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou is my favourite anime.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10+/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 10+/10\\n\r\nArt: 10+/10\\n\r\nSound: 10+/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10+/10\\n\r\nOverall: 10+/10",

            "content": "Let me make it clear that I will now write a lot about how this anime left me feeling, and reasons for it... Reasons for why many people like myself like this show so much...\r\n[There will probably be quite heavy spoilers]\r\nSo let me begin with saying that this show really left me feeling with the \"void\" feeling after finishing it, the type of feeling of... seeing something so true (if that makes any sense). It goes over some very dark ideas throughout the whole series which might at first be quite apparent but there's way more if one cares to delve deeper.\r\nIn the show weare shown what only seems to be a destroyed world far into the future, not a single type of plant or animals are still alive and at no point in the show do we see foliage of any kind, instead, we see the world covered in metal presumably to make it easier to live on for humans, to basically, create a \"perfect\" home for those living on it. Of course the dreams of life are rarely no more and with great cities destroyed the way it is in the show, it becomes almost impossible to live.\\n\\n\r\nI think one important part of the show that I feel makes a lot of people like it, is duo to how mysterious it is. We aren't really told what destroyed the planet more than subtle hints every now and then and it really never explain things in the story, yet even though this is true, it feels like everything has a reason, it feels like everything has a backstory that makes sense. They've created a world that seems so believable it might as well be our earth.\\n\\n\r\nBy having such rare encounters with people in the series, it creates something I don't think I've almost ever seen in a different show... It's the feeling of isolation in a world were millions and billions of people once roamed the earth. This creates not specifically a suspension each type they meet a new person, but almost as if a new hope, something which the 2 main characters seem to lack more and more the more they go on.\\n\\n\r\nAlso when speaking about lack of hope, Yuuri, one of the main characters, keeps singing a tune about no hope, but she doesn't sing it in a way that's specifically sad but almost as if happy and cheerful. I think it's quite obvious to say that she isn't \"happy\" with everything being the way it is now, but more so, trying to make time pass while creating a mood. In such desperate times there's no real need to make it any worse, therefore this could be her (like we also see her do in many other ways) to try to cheer up Chito (the other main character).\\n\\n\r\nTo be completely honest, it is really hard to explain this story without seeing it with your own eyes. I've had many people tell me and other reviews say that \"literally nothing happened in the show\", which if you're one of these people I believe you misunderstood the reason this show is so loved. It's not because it very specifically gets to a goal at the end, but exactly because it doesn't. They wander the earth with basically no real confidence and hope, and that's exactly what they get.. they get a endless world filled with nothing but metallic buildings destroyed and a reminder that they too will soon enough join this rubble.\\n\\n\r\nOne show that I could say is kind of similar to this is \"Made in Abyss\", another one of the series I've given a 10 (I haven't given many shows a 10). Both aren't scared to really show how the real world is, everything doesn't always have to end well and things don't always have to coincidentally happen just so the main characters of the show can continue on a mission, this is one idea that sparks life in both of the these shows and gives them a sense of relatability.\\n\\n\r\nI find myself often listening back to the songs from the series, for example the opening, the opening itself has quite a happy tone, yet each time I listen to it, I almost shed a tear, remembering the greatness which is this show, it means more to me than I could possibly convey.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is easily a 10/10 for me, in fact I'd like to give it a higher score. If you haven't seen this show (then sorry for spoiling some basics of it, but you will certainly still enjoy it) then you really should check it out! \"Don't watch anime with your eyes closed\"",

            "content": "Two chibi girls on a vintage Kettengrad motorbike explore the war-ravaged city that they once called home. This sentence without context sounds ridiculous, but Girls' Last Tour manages to pull it off by providing one of the best shows of the season  with beautiful background imagery, variation between the two leads that mimic those of two sides of a brain, and a soothing yet melancholic soundtrack\r\nThe quality of the backgrounds can be mostly attributed to the widely used post-apocalyptic setting and the source material of the show. Tsukumizu's elaborate ruined cityscapes of rusted pipes and war-torn steel fully contrast with the two chibi, moeleads.\\n\\n\r\nChito and Yuuri compose the dual leads that this anime relies on to contrast it's grim setting. If you were to divide the two into the halves of a brain, Chi would be the intellectual right and Yu would be the cheery left. Both care immensely for each other, as seen in the show, and operate almost as one conscious entity. The very design of our two main characters is the antithesis of this show's setting of a post-apocalypse, something that has been done in other shows such as Made in Abyss. The interactions the two have with each other can only be described as nostalgic, and the soundtrack of this show furthers this by a significant margin.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is very well supplemented with acoustic guitar and vocals among other instruments and is often used to evoke a sense of discovery or nostalgia as the two girls venture throughout the city. The warmth of the guitar clashes with the frigid concrete, providing another point of divergence that fuels the nostalgia train. \\n\\n\r\nThe technical aspect of this show is pretty impressive on its own, but the themes and thought-provoking questions that Chito and Yuuri impose upon the reader also need to be taken into consideration. They might be open-ended but hint towards a deeper learning that is happening as the two girls adventure through the wasteland. The story itself might be disconnected in some regard, but the experiences that our two leads are having could be interpreted as rediscovering what it means to be human. The episode titles contribute to this as well, with simple names like Bath or Friends. \\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, Girls' Last Tour is without a doubt the best show of this winter season, displaying an array of insightful themes with impressive execution. I hope Studio White Fox makes a second season for this gem \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Are the issues we face in the present really that important in the grand scheme of things? What does it mean to live? If our civilisation comes to an end one day, will it really be that bad?\r\nGirl Last Tour is a unique take on post-apocalyptic fiction and in my view one of the most beautiful shows to come out in a long time. The setting might seem bleak and depressing at first glance, and whilst those feelings are present,it\u2019s mostly used as a backdrop for the talking points of the main characters. It might also seem like another Moe, slice-of-life show that has value in its cuteness and not much more, but it\u2019s really much more than that. It\u2019s an abstract journey through history and human culture through the eyes of people who never got to experience it themselves, with a perspective completely detached from our everyday lives and personal drama. It makes you think about how insignificant many of our stresses and quarrels really are in the grand scheme of things and often brings into question the meaning of why we live and do the things we do. Themes like war and human greed are brought up and criticised, just as is the importance of knowledge, keeping records and the preservation of life. In many ways this show is a harsh introspection of ourselves as a species and in many others it\u2019s an optimistic exploration of the beauty of living and learning. More than anything, it's about finding hope for the future even when the world seems bleak and empty.\\n\\n\r\nBoth the setting and characters are vehicles for the social commentary of this show, and as such don\u2019t end up being particularly interesting in themselves. There\u2019s no grand, overarching plot or a great deal in the way of character development, because that\u2019s not really the point of Girls\u2019 Last Tour. It\u2019s not a show about fictional characters, it\u2019s a show about how we think about the world and ourselves, and it works exceptionally well.",

            "content": "I've watched almost every anime listed in MAL, but this is my first time i really want to write a review here, special for this pure gem.\r\nStory: After watching so many anime of course it is so hard to find a new anime with a fresh plot. As listed in synopsys, this anime is about 2 girls journey in post apocalyptic world. What makes the story special is because of the nihilistic life lesson that the girls discuss from what they experience in their journey, meeting new things, people and even robot. \r\nCharacter: This probably what makes me falling in love with this anime becauseof the 2 main characters, Chito and Yuuri. Chito is always try to be rational even though she is so shy. And Yuuri who is so eccentric, and somehow always found a way to almost kill chito accidently. The interaction between the two is pure gem. They help each other to stay positive in the end of the world, where almost nothing is positive.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Well, i am 100% enjoy watching this anime. Even though the atmosphere if this anime is kinda dark kinda similar to Made in Abyss anime, but the Yuuri and Chito interaction always lifted the mood. They discuss heavy life lesson, such as the meaning of life, hope, happiness, and even about God, with simple thought from their experience. Even though i usually don't like philosophy anime but it doesnt really a bother for me, as they present it lightly and wrap it with comedy from Chito and Yuuri, which always give me smiles afterward.\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound:\\n\r\nI never grade an anime based on art and sound, because for me the core of anime are the plot/story and characters. \\n\\n\r\nIn term of art I think this anime is pretty good as you could even guess what is in the blurry background perfectly, even people could know the type of war weapon and machine that the duo passed in the journey. Well with the Characters moe blob design, I think this is also perfect to lift the mood and make me reminiscing Hidamari Sketch anime.\\n\\n\r\nWell, for sound I'm pretty sure this anime has best quality in this section, as I always hear people compare this anime has soundtrack as good as Made in Abyss anime, which is already famous for its soundtrack. Not to mention this anime has Inori Minase as Chito VA, Opening and Ending singer, also there is an insert song where the characters sing together with rain.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Probably the best way to describe this anime is: this is the fusion of Made in Abyss, Kino no Tabi, and Hidamari Sketch. \\n\\n\r\nOut of all anime ever made till now, this is my favorite in Slice of Life genre. This anime makes me cry and laugh, give me hope in hopelessness, and teach me that everything will be fine even though nothing is fine.\\n",

            "content": "What makes a good post-apocalyptic story?\r\nThe atmosphere. A dense and foreboding feeling that life was at one time much greater than it is today, but now all that\u2019s left is a hollow shell of a former civilization that you\u2019ll never be a part of. What makes the story of Girls' Last Tour (AKA Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou) great is not just the slice of life style plot. It\u2019s the storytelling that makes it great. \r\nAs Chito and Yuri explore the desolate city they learn more things about the setting, which in turn gives the audience useful information to piece together the setting. The world they livein is implied to be Earth in the distant future after a war has wreaked havoc then all but left the world barren. Chi and Yuu spend each episode exploring, looking for supplies, and finding new aspects to their world that they had never known before. The show implies that they were born after the war because of the director\u2019s impressive ability to tell us about the characters in subtle ways. Whether it be the way that they react to finding something that would seem normal to people like us. For example, They find a fish at one point and are only able to identify it based on distant memories. From that simple interaction, we have enough information to infer that they have never seen live fish and most likely a body of water. \\n\\n\r\nLittle details like this are all over the show. You\u2019ll constantly be learning about the world of Girl\u2019s Last Tour without a single line of exposition. \\n\r\nI was impressed from beginning to end because of the well-executed story. Girl\u2019s Last Tour understands that there\u2019s beauty in simplicity and it shows us its understanding at any chance it gets.\\n\\n\r\nThe overarching plot is relatively simple and could be categorized as a slice of life by some standards. In every episode the girls go somewhere new, they\u2019re constantly driving after all. They make pit stops at a place each episode to refuel or just to investigate a new location. We gain insight as to what Chi and Yuu know and comprehend about the world through their various pit stops. The two main characters Chi and Yu are the base of the show, if you don\u2019t like their chibi designs or their childish personalities then chances are you won\u2019t enjoy Girl\u2019s Last Tour. For me, their childish look and goofy banter between one another made the show incredibly pleasant despite taking place in a desolate post-apocalyptic world. The fact that they\u2019re able to joke about\\n\\n\r\nEven though their personalities are incredibly basic I did appreciate well defined they are. From the first episode, you\u2019ll have a good understanding of who they are and why they are the way they are. The worst issue with Girl\u2019s Last Tour (AKA; Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou) is how wildly inconsistent the characters\u2019 knowledge is. For example; in one scene Yuu says she didn\u2019t know that the Earth spun, yet in the same scene she displayed an understanding of geometry. In another scene, Karma is mentioned by the girls yet in a previous episode they had no idea what a church was\u2026 It was like the show was actively telling me to ignore all of the experience they had gone through over the course of the show. I felt like it wanted me to just embrace the characters as cute cardboard cutouts meant to be laughed at rather than studied. Throughout their journey, they meet a number of enigmatic inhabitants of the city, all of which have interesting information to provide to the girls, and the audience.\\n\\n\r\nFrequently CGI is used for the car that they drive, but the world has an undeniably arresting aesthetic. It\u2019s a bleak world with a color palette consisting of mostly black, white, brown, and grey, but there is a beauty in the lighting and plentiful use of shadows. While the visuals may not inspire as much imagination as a show like Made in Abyss does, they still tell a story. One of the best ways the director tells a story through visuals is his obsession with stairs. And I mean that in the best way possible. Every time the characters are shot climbing up in their little car there is a double meaning to the scene. The further they rise the more they learn about their world. In the very first scene of the show, the lead characters are introduced in a dark cavern driving along as they always do. By simply shooting the characters in a visually interesting factory, the director does an amazing job of establishing that the story is about these childish characters and their journey to becoming adults.\\n\\n\r\nTo complement the empty world and the mystical atmosphere is a mellow soundtrack. I do love the music, but it\u2019s really underused. Many scenes have no music at all. Just background noises that add a bit to the atmosphere and believability of the show\u2019s world. The whirr of the car engine, the clinking of metal, and the well-performed voices of Chi and Yuu are what make up much of the show\u2019s ambient sounds. Thanks to the great voice actresses of the lead characters their personalities come across really well without the show ever needing to tell us explicitly about who the characters are. The show is effortlessly enjoyable thanks to the voices. Small inflections in their voices are enough to figure out what they\u2019re thinking without requiring any unnecessary dialogue to explain things. \\n\\n\r\nI can\u2019t really complain too much that the soundtrack was underused because the best songs were saved for the best scenes. During these titular moments the melancholy soundtrack rises in volume until it becomes the only thing you can hear, it does a great job of hammering home impact of some important scenes. \\n\\n\r\nThe show lives and breathes the phrase, \u201cThe journey is more important than the destination.\u201d Even though it is a slice of life show, you\u2019re constantly being given details about the setting through Chito and Yuu as they learn more about the world on their journey. Some of the shenanigans they get into are funny. However, don't expect a comedy because it's mostly just a cute and uplifting tone that keeps it enjoyable. There are very few jokes. Which is totally fine because it would probably drain all of the tension from the moody atmosphere. \\n\\n\r\nThere's a small amount of nudity of the two girls, but it never felt leering to me. It's played off lightheartedly just like the upbeat tone of the rest of the show.\\n\\n\r\n[Final Score 8.4/10]\\n\r\nAn interesting setting and fantastic visual storytelling make Girl\u2019s Last tour immediately worth watching. Whether or not you will be immersed in the world of Girl\u2019s Last Tour depends on how interested you are in the world and journey the lead characters undergo. It\u2019s so content with simply being happy and heartwarming that I didn\u2019t feel like it was missing much. The atmosphere is dense and the mysterious setting offers something more substantial for you to chew on, which is good because I like my slice-of-life shows with at least a little bit of meaningful content.",

            "content": "In a nutshell: Girls' Last Tour is a beautiful show about two friends travelling somewhere, anywhere, in a broken world.  But even when everything is grey, bleak nothingness, Girls' Last Tour shows us that we can still somehow find joy and bliss simply by being together.  This is a fairly relaxed show.  There is no exciting plot to follow.  There is no daunting enemy that our heroes must somehow conquer with the power in their hearts.  This is a show that is much more about daily life and watching the world outside.  It is the \"sitting in a cafeon a rainy, staring out the window\" rather than the \"racing down an empty highway in a supercar\" kind of show.\\n\\n\r\nThe part I love most about Girls' Last Tour is its emotional strength. \\n\r\n Combining wonderful art, music, and voicing, it is able to conjure emotion in ways that don't need to take advantage of the usual feelings-cheap-shots.  And it doesn't just hit the usual emotional targets of sadness and happiness.  What stuck out to me is the profound sense of wonder, tragedy, and simple bliss that I got over and over again.  These are things that are usually quite hard and unusual to aim for.  It's difficult to describe, but this show yanks on my heartstrings like nothing else while not taking advantage of emotional low-blows, if that makes any sense.  However, this is not to say that this is just a serious or depressing anime.  In such a dead world, Chi and Yuu are bright lights of joy and happiness.  There's plenty of comedy as well, usually due to the antics of one character in particular.  \\n\\n\r\nStory, other than the fantastic world-building, is non-existent (and not the point).  There are really only mini-plots, but no real major plot other than the tale of the past.  (I've rated Story as 9 anyways because I'm a real sucker for mysterious world-building, even if it's only in the background)\\n\\n\r\nUsing moe chibis juxtaposed on a brutalist landscape is such an amazing contrast.  Art in the show is wonderful.  Though everything is usually grey and rectangular and sharp and mute, it actually never gets old.  The background shapes and environments are always changing.  In a way, the dullness of the world is so much more interesting than the usual fantasy/sci-fi worlds that are wild and brimming with vibrant color.  And when there is color in the world, it is used spectacularly.  Animation is also on point.  The chibi faces are put to good comedic effect.  Animated movement is simple but effective. \\n\\n\r\nMusic and sound design are, simply put, incredible.  It's hard to describe without a spoiler-ish example, but there are great combinations of songs, sound effects, and art that just put you in awe.  Voicing fits perfectly for each character, and some characters are really just enjoyable to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is a show that I cannot stop loving.  It is not action-packed.  It does not have romance.  It does not have an incredible rise of a hero against all odds.  It is a wonderful piece of slice-of-life, atmospheric, and emotional art that reminds us that anime doesn't need intense action or distressing conflict to be great.  I cannot express just how wonderful and amazing this experience is.  \\n\\n\r\nBy the way, even if you don't end up watching this, I implore you to at least listen to the OST.  Though some songs will not have the same impact without knowing the context, the score is amazing on its own.",

            "content": "Two girls takes a post-apocalyptic trip...\r\nShoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou by it's it's definition for LA was LA's zen anime for Fall 2017. \r\nShoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou follows Chito voiced by Inori Minase and Yuuri voiced by Yurika Kubo as they explore their post-apocalyptic world in a vast underground city of possibilities. Now you'd think this kind of anime would be boring but actually with the simple daily lives of Chito and Yuuri simply exploring a section of the world they live in actually gives off some platitudes about humanity itself considering the setting they are placed in.\r\nChito and Yuuri as characters are your typical characters of thestrict and methodical one of Chito while Yuuri is the laid-back character only caring about food (no seriously this becomes a running gag). Their relationship by all means are unstable but we still know they are friends through and through from a world where they are the only ones, it's given that they would want company. Now LA did say that both Chito and Yuuri are the only ones exploring their world however LA isn't being exactly correct as do indeed met remnants of civilizations if it's only two characters they met in this anime screentime. Is this a problem?, no as it delves into more world building about this underground city that both Chito and Yuuri are exploring and surviving in. \\n\\n\r\nShoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou dives into some subtle themes about humanity (and thankfully they don't hammer it in!), due to how episodic the anime is, Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou does explore even this and they do it discretely, from the simple act of rain touching empty cans making us think about music to robots clash over one another to preserve plants showing us if robots can have \"feelings\"...it's all nicely done and not at all hammered in.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation done by White Fox, the character designs do have the chibified nature to them and LA is completely ok with that, though some wouldn't. The feature when it comes to Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou are the beautiful backgrounds. LA would think the only problem to all this are the clash of chibi and gorgeous backgrounds would be annoying and actually no...it's fine showing something of a \"laid-back nature to what is showing the setting to be a depressed yet beautiful nature and counteracting the two together to actually work instead\".\\n\\n\r\nIn terms fo voice acting, there really is only two MVP and that are Inori Minase and Yurika Kubo. Fun fact, LA thought Yuuri was voiced by Ayane Sakura at first but was surprised it was Yurika Kubo...she's come a long way since Hanayo from Love Live?. Other notable surprising voice actors in this anime would go to Yuki Kaji, Kotono Mitsushi and Kana Hanazawa. The voice cast as minimal as they are, was amazing.\\n\\n\r\nOddly enough the ending to Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou tied some world building threads together and finally gave us a bit of closure as to HOW this post-apocalyptic underground city was even made, but if that's not your cup of coffee, then the ending actually showed us that Chito really cares for Yuuri as much of a pain in the ass and annoyance she was to Chito in their trip together. Either way great ending!\\n\\n\r\nWhat can LA say about Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou other than if you want a very zen anime looking at a beautifully post-apocalyptic world with two chibi explorers, then this is the anime for you.",

            "content": "I have never written a review for any anime, so apologies if this is not perfect. Before I continue however, I just want to say how masterful this show is, and why, in my opinion, is anime of the season.\r\nWith a lot of plots in anime, there is most often an end goal, a resolution that can be foreseeable. I am nowhere near someone who is truly experienced with anime, but for the reason that this show is more or so about the journey makes it really interesting.\r\nThe difference between the harsher moments and the cheerful moments almost makes the show more real. The charactersbring out important philosophical questions with just mere conversation, and the supporting characters and entities help make those points. Their ignorance of many of humanities current issues, like war, makes the viewer think of our current world and relate. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, for the characters themselves, they did an outstanding job of balancing the characters, of creating silly scenes but not overdoing it. Chito and Yuuri's contradicting personalities help blend in crucial scenes in the show and give more essence to any philosophy attempting to be presented in the show. Nuko is also really cute :3\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of art-style, I really like the blend between the scenes showing the characters and then the detail on the different pieces of technology; It helps build the contrast. The music is also really nice, and I love how they incorporated it into the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I highly recommend this if you want something fresh. I am not a fan of the Slice of Life genre, but they incorporate it here well.",

This anime, at first sight while watching the PV, seemed very interesting. It takes place in a world where humans are nearly extinct because of war. There are only a few number of people left in the world including our main characters, Chito andYuuri. This anime follows their journey as they wander around the post-apocalyptic world learning about things before the world came to an end.\\n\\n\r\nAfter finishing this series, all I need to say is \"Watch this series if you want a different anime than what we got recently\". This series is extraordinary in a lot of ways. First, let's talk about the characters. Chito is your usual cute and serious female character. She can also be quite tsundere at some time, while Yuuri is a very positive character who loves eating. The contrast between these two characters are very fun to look at. Their interaction with each other are also very cute, funny and sometimes very heartwarming. \\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the sound, this is AMAZING! I'm not kidding when I say that the soundtracks are god-tier level. Such beautiful musics can't be easily found in other anime. Suehiro Kenichiro, composer for Re:Zero, might be the next Kajiura Yuki. The soundtracks are so gorgeous. I can't find any more words to describe how good the musics are. Just listen to it while watching the series. I guarantee you won't be disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have the art and animation. The designs for the characters are very moe/cute, but as a fan of this kind of designs, this doesn't bother me at all, but I've heard a lot of people complaining about it so I might as well put it here as a warning. The animation is fluid. Every scene is beautifully animated. The backgrounds are also mesmerizing, so beautiful. Praise Studio White Fox.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is a great series that you can't often find in anime. It's unique, well-executed and beautifully animated. You can see so much the staff cares about this series while watching the episode. I'll recommend this to those who like post-apocalyptic setting and moe anime. Even if you don't like those, at least give the 1st episode a try, who knows, you might end up enjoying it. That's it for my review. Thanks for reading.  :)",

            "content": "Personal Rate: 5\r\nOverall Rate based on the different criteria: 5.2 rounded down to 5\r\nWEIRD JAPANESE ANIME ALERT! Ok, this show is not for everyone... It received a lot of praises in some reviews and while I agree that the premise is interesting the show lacks in execution. When an anime is really not my thing but I consider that it would be unfair to give it a bad rate, I usually go for a 6, and the overall rate usually ends up being higher... Surprisingly that wasn't the case with Girls' Last Tour. And since I got an overall score of 5, well I choseto give it a 5 instead of my usual 6. Does it deserve such high rates ( at the time I'm typing this the overall score is 8.19 based on over 34 000 viewers)? My answer is no. Like many other shows, sometimes you get something unusual and people are quick to jump on the high rate wagon because of the uniqueness of what they're watching. So here I go, I'll be among the minority and too bad for me.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 2\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nCharacter: 4\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4\\n\r\nOverall:5\\n\\n\r\nStory: 2\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing worth of interest if the starting point. We follow Chito and Yuuri in their endless wandering through cities ravaged by war. It's not clear where these girls are going, if there are other humans or creatures or what exactly happened. Now, once this is made clear you've basically seen everything worth seeing in the show. The rest is completely episodic. Every episode consists of the girls existing their daily existence ( and yes, I'm saying existing because honestly eating rations and going from once place to the next is in no way living). Discovering a \"new place\" and taking a shower? One episode. Making bread. One Episode. Meeting somebody and parting with that somebody. One episode. And the list goes on. \\n\\n\r\nThe 2 last episodes were the only one I found truly interesting... But it was too little too late and both characters glossed over what they saw like it was inconsequential... \\n\\n\r\nFrankly I was bored senseless. I hung on because the show was recommended to me... But frankly I've seen other slices of life where things were actually happening even if overall nothing truly changed ( eg: Hyoukka, Flying Witch).\\n\\n\r\nAgain, this anime is not for everyone.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\\n\r\nPretty good... But frankly see episode 1 and go to episode 12... in terms of visuals there's not lots of effort made. Some 3D are integrated in the show, it's not subtle but it doesn't disturb the narrative. All that grey is truly depressing and man did I miss some plants, and grass and trees... The lack of it really didn't better my mood (though that's the point of the show so I obviously don't consider it a bad point).\\n\r\nAs for the character design, it's round but it does alleviate everything. If the girls were skinny and famished, It would have been difficult to finish this show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nIt's minimalist but man it is great. Honestly, that's the best part. As much as I think this show didn't live up to its interesting premise, the music fits it to a tee.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4\\n\\n\r\nChito: The mature girl.\\n\r\nYuuri: The brainless one.\\n\\n\r\nI guess the highlight for some viewers is the interactions between Chi and Yuu but frankly, Chi was alright but forgettable and Yuu was the embodiment of stupidity. No, I didn't think she was funny. On several instances her stupid behavior got on my nerves. Let's say you see a living creature different from a human for the first time in your life and that, that thing is not threatening you, you're not dying of hunger either... Are you seriously going to think that you should eat it? Worse, that \"running joke\" goes for several episodes every time a tiny opportunity occurs.\\n\\n\r\nYuuri is so senseless, and at time selfish that had I cared about them, well I would have found her infuriating.\\n\\n\r\nAnd yes, that's our ONLY characters there ( not entirely true but that's it for the mains)\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4\\n\\n\r\nI took 3 weeks to finish this show. This is definitely not bingeable and I was not eager to know what followed. Had it not have been recommended to me... I would not have bothered and would have given up at episode 3. This show is literally boredom incarnated.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\\n\r\nThis show has one merit. You know, I always thought that if men were crazy enough to make nuclear weapons fall everywhere, I would not wish to be among the survivors. Better die with the majority if there are only 10 people surviving. Humankind cannot survive which such a small gene pool anyway... and this show confirmed what I thought. Chi and Yuu's lives are truly pointless. Everything is pointless, they have no goal, no dream, no nothing. All they do is exist from one day to the next until their dying breath. Ultimately it's not like they've got a fair grasp of the memory of having a family... Well, personally it made me quite lethargic but maybe it will motivate you to move a little and enjoy the things you have when you have it. I don't know... This show could have been so much more, but ended up being something cute and aimless. Aimless and pointless but ultimately harmless.\\n\\n\r\nCan't recommend it, can't bash it totally because not my thing. I just think that the subject could have been handled differently. It was not a stupid idea... but the execution leaves a lot to be desired.\\n",

            "content": "Please note this review is intended to be read by those that have finished watching Shoujo Shuumatsu and while care has been taken to minimise spoilers there may still be spoilers within character analysis. \r\nIntro and premise \r\nIn a world devastated by war two girls embark on a journey to find the truth and along the way encounter many new lessons that adds new perspective to their lives as they see the devastated world. \r\nBased off a popular web manga of the same name Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou also better known as the Girls Last Tour is a sci-fi and mystery anime that makes use ofa premise and setting not commonly seen in the anime world which is a journey by two young girls in a world that was devastated by large-scale war that killed off much of humanity and left the few survivors to scavenge the ruins for supplies that they can use to live another day. The post-apocalyptic world setting is not one that\u2019s easily seen in animes and more commonly seen in games instead so having two girls travelling through such a world as they go on their journey was what drew me to this anime. Using the journey and the experiences and encounters that the girls encounter along the way the anime allows us to see the girl\u2019s reactions and sentiments as they see a world that while in ruins and mostly devoid of human life still provides many lessons that can be contemplated and remembered.  \\n\\n\r\nThough the world in which the anime takes place in is never quite revealed it can be seen that the world itself is an advanced one that takes the form of a tower that has many floors. Each floor has its own unique climate and theme and seems to be divided into different areas like residential or industrial. Though desolate the world also contains many survivors that have managed to survive and scavenge through weapon littered fields for gear and equipment that can be used to survive.   \\n\\n\r\nThe overall story for Shoujo Shuumatsu follows the life of two girls as they embark on a journey across the vast expanses of the world that they live and include the driver and leader the serious-minded but intelligent Chito and her partner the carefree but oddly positive soldier Yuuri who acts as Chito\u2019s second and best friend. As the girls travel across the vast expanses of the world and explore the ruins of a civilisation they encounter plenty of situations and encounters that provoke deep thought and questions in the girl's minds making them realise that the world is much larger and more complex than what they had read in the limited knowledge that they had. \\n\\n\r\nChito \\n\\n\r\nChito voiced by veteran seiyuu Inori Minase of Re Zero and Re Creators fame is one of the main characters of the series and serves as one of the main protagonists of the series. A cautious, intelligent and strict person Chito serves as the pairs overall leader and driver that directs the overall path that they take as they advance towards their goal. While a serious and strict person by nature Chito is also a level-headed and calm person that likes to have all the facts about a situation on hand before trying to determine the course of action that they should take. This is in contrast to her partner and friend Yuuri who prefers to act on impulse rather than logic. While quiet by nature Chito is shown to be a realist and is not someone that will develop high hopes for something and indeed she is one that prefers to take things slowly but cautiously accomplishing what they need to do in the less risky manner possible. An interesting personality trait of Chito\u2019s is her love of reading, learning and documenting and it can be seen that this comes from her desire to both know about the ancient world and at the same time hoping to create a record of what they had learned in their journey so that it can be used by others. As a result of this, it can be seen that Chito is someone that values knowledge and the maintaining of records and can get surprisingly angry when these are damaged.  While a soldier just like Yuuri is it can be seen that Chito is someone that is a pacifist by nature and doesn\u2019t like to use weapons even to defend herself which I found was rather strange for a soldier. While not hostile towards strangers that they encounter in the wasteland that they travel through it can be seen that Chito is someone that trusts slowly and wary of any strangers that cross their path. However, once they have proven themselves trustworthy it can be seen that she can be quite warm and trusting towards them. \\n\\n\r\nThe character of Chito I felt was an interesting character and one that was well developed and designed. In addition to serving as the one that kept the pair focused on the overall goal of the journey Chito also served as a contrast to her partner Yuuri serving as a foil that dealt with the worst of Yuuri\u2019s impulses. While her calm and cautious nature is what stops Yuuri from getting too crazy with her impulses the fact that Chito is also an avid reader and believes in seeking and recording knowledge also serves as an additional safeguard and adds charm to her character.  \\n\\n\r\nYuuri \\n\\n\r\nYuuri voiced by veteran seiyuu Yurika Kubo of Youkoso and Urara Meirochou fame is one of the main characters of the series and is Chito\u2019s partner on the journey that they are taking. A carefree, positive and happy person by nature Yuuri is someone that is the very definition of a joker as she in contrast to her partner Chito is someone that can remain optimistic even in the grimmest of situations. While Chito\u2019s serious personality often results in her causing somewhat tense situations Yuri\u2019s personality as a joker is able to balance this out by introducing a number of light-hearted moments that help defuse such situations such as building snowballs on Chi\u2019s head after a long trek and seeing snow in the morning. Unlike Chito who is well versed in both reading and writing Yuuri is someone that lacks both of those skills but is able to bounce back up due to her ability to adapt to new situations relatively quickly. While Yuuri herself can be overactive and careless at times it can be seen that beneath that happy side of her Yuuri is someone that is more perceptive than she first seems and is someone that is cautious and wary of strangers. When new situations and parties appear in their midst it can also be seen that her bond and friendship with Chito is something that she cares about greatly and values and as a result, she is fiercely protective of Chito. The character of Yuuri I felt was an interesting one as her personality contrasted a great deal with her partner Chito yet at the same time she also complemented Chito\u2019s own flaws as well. One aspect of Yuuri\u2019s personality that I particularly liked is her ability to create the most interesting and comical of questions from the most random things that she sees on her journeys something that is necessary in the long journeys that the girls go on. \\n\\n\r\nAMV \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation, I felt that the character designs for the series main characters of Chito and Yuuri were well done and reflected well on the fact that in this world fashion and style pale in comparison to ease of maintenance and functionality. The design of the girl\u2019s main form of transportation which though unnamed in the series I felt was interesting as it looked like a combo of a bike and a tractor and as a result allowed them to travel along many different types of terrain quite easily. The various terrain that the girls travel through as they go about their journey though I felt was well developed and designed though as each level and area that they go through was unique in terrain and theme and featured unique challenges that the girls had to overcome as they encounter it. The music for the series I felt was pretty good and the background music did well to complement the different situations that the girls encounter along the way. The opening and ending themes of the series, I felt were also well done with the former being catchy and funny and symbolising positive thinking and the latter symbolising optimism. The voice acting for the series was strong and I felt that despite the lack of an effective backstory that Inori Minase and Yurika Kubo who voiced the main leads of Chito and Yuuri respectively did an excellent job of portraying their characters and showing the unique interaction that exists between them when they are exploring. \\n\\n\r\nOverall conclusion \\n\\n\r\nIn overall Shoujo Shuumatsu was an interesting anime that had among its main strong points an interesting premise, interesting story, character interaction and excellent voice acting. Though the premise of a post-apocalyptic world is rare by anime standards it is not unheard off but the concept of a journey in which two young girls explore the wasteland as part of their quest to reach their objective was one that drew my attention to it. The overall story of the series while thin along the lines of what their overall quest was still managed to accomplish the task of expanding upon the wasteland and developing the girl\u2019s characters by introducing various situations and events that the girls encounter along the way. Each of these situations and events while not overly dramatic and indeed rather simple also did well to introduce us to the state of the world that the girls live in as well as provoke some interesting theories and opinions that the girls express. The fact that knowledge about this world is so few and far between also serves to enhance this process as neither girl knows about the things that they can encounter along the way and as a result, their opinion and theories are based on their personalities instead which makes every event and encounter interesting to see.  The fact that these feature many different themes I felt also served to enhance this.  Within the series there are many examples of simple things that we take for granted that no one no longer knows exists such as music, camera\u2019s, elevators and watching the main characters reactions as they encounter this and be amazed by it also serves to remind us just how much this world has lost to the fires of war. The interactions between the two main characters I felt was also one of the strong points to the series as between the situations and events that the characters encounter are many quiet moments and seeing the conversations that take place between the two as they head on to the next encounter I felt was funny and refreshing and helped greatly by the fact that these conversations can start from the most random of topics that can create the most interesting of answers. The atmosphere of each of the episodes as the girls explore the various areas that they encounter I felt was also well done and helped convey a sense of loneliness to the world that harmonises well with the setting.  \\n\\n\r\nIn overall Shoujo Shuumatsu was an anime that while having an interesting premise and characters expanded upon its greatest weakness, which was its weak story by introducing events and situations that the girls meet along the way that featured a surprisingly large number of themes and questions and answers that were also surprisingly deep and well thought out that resonated well with this world that the girls live in where knowledge is rare and precious. In terms of final score, I think this anime will deserve a final score of 9/10. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Times sure are changing and so is anime. With titles like Youjo Senki and Made in Abyss, loli characters are getting a new dimension of ideas and Girls\u2018 Last Tour is yet another example of this. But instead of loli hitler or a dark fantasy with children, we have iyashikei in a post apocalyptic setting. But is its creativeness enough to make a show good? Sometimes it might be, but the anime has more to offer.\r\nBut before that there\u2019s one huge problem to face and that\u2019s merging 2 absolutely opposite things \u2013 iyashikei and post apocalyptic setting, as mention before. But they managed to doit perfectly like it was nothing. While I still don\u2019t know how they\u2019ve done, after 20 minutes of one episode I was completely calm and forgot about all my daily worries for a moment, even though I was watching 2 girls, Chito and Yuuri, having conversations about various topics, while they were searching for food, trying to survive in a world without civilization. Danger can come from anywhere and yet you still will be smiling.\\n\\n\r\nThe dialogs are not there just for a light hearted humor for your relaxation though as they make one ask himself many philosophical question, which is quite enjoyable and serves as a great icing on the cake. Dark colors even give it more serious flavor, but chubby art style of characters still leaves it heartwarming and the balanace between those two is just right. As brighter episodes are to show up, we also come across to not that serious topics, but still explore interesting ideas Chito and Yuuri have to discuss like \u201cWhat is house?\u201c or \u201cWhat is God?\u201c, and also relaxing subjects like \u201cFish\u201d, \u201cCooking\u201d or \u201cMusic\u201d. Because their daily lives are about food search, they have no clue about those things and look at them in a captivating perspective. And it\u2019s the same about more serious topics like \u201cLife\u201d or \u201cDestruction\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nWhat their main goal is? There\u2019s no real answer, since there might not even be one, as they keep moving forward and climbing up, their destinations change based on their mood and surroundings. And that\u2019s exactly how it\u2019s done right, since there\u2019s no one alive (just few exceptions) where would you go? Just explore, be curious, probably reach as high as you can and chat with your friend, and that\u2019s exactly portrayed here, so it\u2019s really easy to empathize with them and understand their actions.\\n\\n\r\nThey are lucky though to have a friend to share their journey with. In a world full of solitude a companion comes in handy and we even had a chance to see 2 characters all by themselves. We could see in their personality and the way they talked, that they were lonely. In need to find a purpose in life, they either draw maps or want to construct an airplane to fly to another city. But what if you lose all of it? What comes after that? A partner to ease the loneliness is priceless.\\n\\n\r\nTheir relationship is really beautiful. As we watch them struggle to find food, it\u2019s really easy to make you smile even over the most stupid joke they make (and they make plenty of good ones). A really true friendship, they share everything, they hide nothing, what would happen if one lost another? As we were poked with this question in the series, it\u2019s really a frightening thought. By the time I reached the final episode, I could totally relate to them and aside from everything mentioned before, there\u2019s a lot of emotions to feel.\\n\\n\r\nGirls\u2019 Last Tour also has done a very good job in their drawings and animated scenes well, though I especially appreciate the CGI work, which has collected a bad reputation lately, but the movements of Girls\u2019 vehicle, Kettenkrad, is here to show us that if given enough attention, it can work in anime too. A limited palette of colors is also a perfect way to set up a good atmosphere. Dark colors work perfectly to leave a mystery aspect in the background and leave an impression of danger, while when we have a lot of bright and white colors, we feel more safe and it lightens up the audience. \\n\\n\r\nWith a lot of themes in an episodic story, to come up with a rich collection of good soundtracks is a challenge, but we are not left disappointment. There are many OST to cover everything and really nicely follow us throughout the show. Contrasting opening is one to remember, tunes our mood well and is almost unskippable, pleasant to listen to. As well the \u201cdab scene\u201d was surprising to everyone and made me to wait for it every time. The ending songs weren\u2019t that good as the opening, but still were really well handled and you could feel, that the show is saying good bye to us, watchers, especially the last episode's ending had honestly a strong impact on me. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime serves its purpose, is fresh, makes you think, is charming to watch, shows us a good progress in CGI, has a lovely music and overall is an awesome series. Though it might not appeal for someone looking for a bigger plot, it\u2019s still great in many other ways and surely would recommend anyone seeking a well written story. Definitely belongs to one of my favorites of the season.\\n",

There are no real spoilers in this review. Here goes:\r\n       This anime is fantastic, but not for everyone. There's honestly very few a\u0336n\u0336i\u0336m\u0336e\u0336s\u0336  sources of entertainment that'll give you the same atmosphere/feeling as SSR, the best way i can describe it is a calming feel of despair. \r\nLayers\r\n       SSR isn't a surface level show. It's pretty obvious from the beginning that it's written in away to encourage the audience to think along with it. The characters and settings are used as a medium to raise up difficult/controversial topics such as life, religion, death and war. SSR is \\n\r\nnot subtle with being philosophical and artsy. It happens rarely, but at times the show sacrifices proper dialog flow to bring up these topics. Many details/clues of the world/setting are shown and not explicitly told and i've missed quite a few of them without help from the comment sections. Still, I strongly suggest watching every episode blind before reading comments. If you're wanting a straight forward plot with a typical anime arc then this is the wrong place to look.   \\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\n       I went into this show with the question \"How can you possibly fill 20+ minutes of content for 12 episodes with just two characters?\" and i'm quite satisfied with the answer. The two main characters compliment each other so well that they can rival any iconic duo. Chi and Yui felt like a mixture of Calvin and Hobbs + George and Lennie; something very cartoon-like and innocent mixed with pity and reality. The heavy topics explored in the show are all presented through the insightful, different and childlike worldviews of Chi and Yui. \\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound\\n\r\n       This anime is beautiful. It's got an unique cartoon-ish art-style for its characters that sets it apart from your typical anime. The backgrounds and surroundings are especially well-done. I felt that the lighting and color scheme was brilliant and tailored especially to this show. The sound effects are top notch and the BGM is memorable and fits the show well. I normally skip Ops and tune out before the Ed even begins but I simply couldn't do the same for SSR. Both Op and Ed are unskippable once it starts, i tried once but felt so guilty afterwards that i went back and listened to it twice. VAs fit their roles and gave a great performance for their respective characters.\\n\\n\r\n       I'm not saying you have to be Einstein to enjoy this show but know that it's not meant to be sat through mindlessly. The slice of life tag is both prominent and misleading as SSR is vastly different than most shows sharing this tag. Keep in mind that \"slice of life\" is very much dependent on who's life it is and what world they're in. SSR does ultimately bring about that \"slice of life\" feel but through very different means. This anime does NOT have any significant amount of comedic moments and it does NOT have any shots that's meant for fan-service. In fact, this principle applies in varying degrees to the other three tags (adventure, sci-fi, mystery) as well. Ultimately if you want to experience what i considered to be one of the more unique animes out there, then give Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou a shot and it's not likely to disappoint.   \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Let me preface this by saying that I have never reviewed something on MAL before, so don't expect this to be perfect.\r\nI would argue that Girl's Last Tour (or, as I'll be referring to it for the rest of this review, GLT) is one of the most criminally underrated shows of the fall 2017 anime season, and maybe one of the most criminally underrated shows that I've ever seen on this site.  Sitting (currently) at a 7.69, I decided that some justice needed to be served - and if this review can convince anyone to pick up this hidden gem, or at least giveit a better score, then my goals will be fulfilled.  \\n\\n\r\nStory and Worldbuilding - 8/10\\n\r\nTruthfully, GLT doesn't have a very strong hook.  If the gorgeously haunting visuals and music in the first episode don't catch you, then it's probably not your cup of tea.  However, the farther that the characters venture into their world, the subtle hints at a greater picture will draw you in, and the stark disparity of Chito and Yuuri's situation in comparison to a normal life is depressingly realistic.  Despite this, the show manages to convey sad, melancholic scenes (such as the imaginary house scene) and beautiful scenes (the sound of rain) in the same episode.  It's a perfect blend for 22 minutes of weekly enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 9/10\\n\r\nChito and Yuuri are interesting and entertaining characters to watch, in their comedy skits AND their philosophical ramblings.  Their dynamic rarely overstays its welcome, and the cute little quirks of their companionship (like Yuuri edging closer to Chito in the camera scene) are really endearing.  While side characters do occasionally show up to develop the world or show new perspectives to the girls, the focus on the main two never fades, and never seems forced.\\n\\n\r\nVisuals - 9/10\\n\r\nWhile the art style may be too simple, or even off-putting at first glance (with the kettencrad often appearing as CGI, and the girls deflating into chibi moeblobs during comedy skits), it does the trick.  The visuals really shine when it comes to aesthetic design and animation, with unique angles appearing every-so-often, and awesome shots of the city and the crazy metal spires making the show serious eye candy.\\n\\n\r\nAudio - 10/10\\n\r\nThe girl's voice actors do their job fine and well, but the real MVP award goes to the sound designer, Jin Aketagawa, who has composed many great soundtracks - with this being one of their most impressive to date.  The orchestral tracks that play during episode 1 and episode 4 are some of the best I have ever heard in an anime, and I look forward to the pieces that may appear in later episodes.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10\\n\r\nGLT is easily my favorite part of the week.  I've even rewatched some of the episodes, just to take a second peek at the beautiful music and backgrounds of each scene.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score - 9/10\\n\r\nWhite Fox continues to deliver with another faithful adaptation of a wonderfully desolate story, that encompasses good visuals, sound design, and lovable characters.  This show deserves to be on the front page, and I highly, HIGHLY encourage that you signal boost this hidden gem!\\n",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nUnlike the leading ladies of Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou, I probably would not survive the apocalypse.\r\nIt first assumes that I\u2019d make it through whatever horrible catastrophe would befall humanity, and I would just-so-happen to be lucky enough to have a fighting chance. But then my prospects would reach zilch real quick when most everything else has disappeared: life\u2019s pleasures, family, some semblance of health.\r\nI wouldn\u2019t know what to do with myself, and I\u2019m sure my mental state would degrade as hopelessness sets in. However, after finishing this anime and seeing the ways in which these girlsapproach such a world, I\u2019ve learned that there may yet be optimism left to cling onto.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nShoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou emerges from its in medias res cocoon as a contrasting hybrid, a chimera formed with the body of a post-apocalyptic lion, the slice-of-life wings of an eagle, and the dramatic-laced tail of a snake. This mystical entity is normally Greek in origin and fantastical in nature, but this variation hails from the land of anime \u2013 and \u201cexists\u201d at that too.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the onset, an amalgamation of parts so jumbled is rightfully questionable. A dreary sadness plagues the atmosphere as melancholy and loss envelop the area, but cuter interactions between the two leads and their environment spark a warmth and a comfort through giggles and fun more commonly found among the cheery, comedic genre.\\n\\n\r\nDespite these extremes, the show balances the creature through thoughtful coexistence. The taming evolves from the manner in which Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou partitions itself into small chapters. These chapters focus on a certain item, place, concept, or action, keeping the scope of their current situation narrow despite the vastness of their predicament.\\n\\n\r\nAs such, there\u2019s no real plot to speak of, and there doesn\u2019t need to be one in the first place. Instead, it spends its time essentially curating a bunch of vignettes as if they were a museum on the back of this chimera, showcasing the testaments to humanity and lining them up for the audience to see in continuous fashion as Chito and Yuuri roll along on their tiny military vehicle.\\n\\n\r\nThis lofty museum features that thoughtfulness. For example, the two ladies will investigate an unknown place and hum and sing a song as they make rations. Or they may sit down in an empty room, imagining the comforting bliss a nostalgic home provides. Or maybe they dance the night away while under the bright moon and a drunken stupor.\\n\\n\r\nWhatever the case, these smaller, almost inconsequential asides demonstrate a caring nature and a maturity in the writing as its methodical approach typifies the happiness discovered in those everyday happenings. Moments in life about life \u2013 without life around them. A contrast so distinct it amplifies the meaning and the power behind its life-lesson topics and appreciation towards the simple things nearby.\\n\\n\r\nThe outside of the museum displays the bigger pictures. Graffiti takes shape as Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou challenges ideas such as religion, war, and death, darker subjects which remind the audience that humanity has its underbelly and its quirks too. Simultaneously, clear windows introduce compassion and determination, for humanity contains goodness at its core.\\n\\n\r\nA chimera and a museum cannot stop all woes, though. It\u2019s arguable that the anime doesn\u2019t lean far enough into its apocalyptic setting. Not that their trip is idyllic or exactly easygoing, but the show keeps itself within a specific circle as it ignores potential avenues (e.g., injuries, psychology). It also bends its fictional realism a tad too far during the last couple episodes when a bizarre technological super-beings subplot treads more so into fantastical territory.\\n\\n\r\nYet (and to extend this extended metaphor one last time) the beast and the building defend themselves. Various dialogue pieces highlight how Chito and Yuuri will reference previous episodes, forming a nice sense of continuity from all their past experiences. And it balances the tone between the drama and comedy well, refusing to lose sight of either as an indication of its sturdy narrative.\\n\\n\r\nIndeed, the overall story is strong in execution.\\n\\n\r\nART & ANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s weird to call destruction of this magnitude \u201cmajestic\u201d, but Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou delivers a majestic artistic vision through the squalor and the voids it depicts.\\n\\n\r\nAll-important establishing shots immediately get at the decrepit state of the world, capturing the wreckage as an unfortunate woe that the girls must traverse to survive. Delipidated buildings. Barren fields of war. Metallic warehouses and hangars. Wind farms. Concrete pillars and hallways. Factories. Abandoned structures. As the title of the anime hints at, this tour of these lasting monuments enshrines not only the pessimism of the situation but also the history of what once was.\\n\\n\r\nThis terrain formed from the rubble of a civilization long dormant thus immortalizes the despair and the malevolence of a place whose eerie loneliness the audience both sees and feels. To this end, the show incorporates swathing details for better realism and quite the dreary color scheme with heavy emphasis on those darker hues. Weapons, tangled masses, and large broken objects litter the path almost everywhere, oppressing with stark impossibility. And the colors: greys, blacks, browns, greens. They complement the carnage present, and they drag down the mood not by force but by a constant realization that there\u2019s almost nothing left except sadness.\\n\\n\r\nYet, through this wreckage, a serene beauty surfaces. Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou punctuates its somber air with scenes of clarity, contrasting the darkness with light and with awe, rays of hope which the audience and the girls admire. From a high-rise look-see at the dazzling cityscape beneath them to a full view of a bright room reflecting off the glass \u201cpond\u201d as a tribute to some unknown deity. The anime lets its majesty shine among the snowy hills, the makeshift forests, and the underground caverns for rare glimpses of optimism.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond the gorgeous setting, the anime makes other conscious decisions with its visuals. Movement remains solid throughout as they interact with the environment and move onwards to that next destination, relying on its at-best stiff CG models only for those most taxing maneuvers with their vehicle. It also goes for creativity as well. A grainy photograph of the two or the smudged filter of an old-timey hand telescope showcase the show branching out with newfound minutiae and perspectives.\\n\\n\r\nTo top it all off, Chito and Yuuri have nice designs to match. They fit the part, what with their soldier helmets and heavy coats protecting them from the inescapable harshness. Contrasting traits \u2013 heights, eyes, hairdos \u2013 pinpoint their differences by looks alone and setup their duo duality with ease. Not to mention how their round-yet-blocky features afford a lot of malleability, seen in the slightly squashed style that aids the comedy with exaggerated looks and extra silliness for a cute, fun approach as required.\\n\\n\r\nThe setting. The fundamentals. The designs. Each part strikes gold in each artistic part, and the anime is all the richer for it.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nChito and Yuuri enter Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou as a tried-and-true narrative pair: the brains and the brawn. Such a standard setup has been around for ages because it works, and these ladies are yet another testament to this fact.\\n\\n\r\nChito essentially leads the group (if it can be described as such). She pilots their mini-tank from location to location, and she manages their free time and side ventures with a perceived caution. Moreover, true to her brainy nature, she reads books to understand culture, she writes down notes as a record of their adventure, and she has her wits about her. However, she has her faults. Heights scare her completely. She does not know how to swim. She lacks physical strength.\\n\\n\r\nYuuri earns opposite stripes. While she loves to laze about and can never have enough food in her belly, she certainly can be her own individual. Using weapons, pushing debris, not being afraid of heights. Clearly the brawny muscle, she anchors the trip they take with a stout head on her shoulders. Much like her companion, though, faults arise. The most notable is her lackadaisical attitude, contributing to a carefree nonchalance in handling situations.\\n\\n\r\nThus, Chito and Yuuri look to each other for help during these trying times. Not just because they must, given they are practically the only people remaining on their godforsaken planet, but also because they can. They cover each other\u2019s weaknesses: Yuuri keeps Chito calm whereas Chito keeps Yuuri reeled in. Yet their most important roles stem from the fact that humanity has an inherent need to think and to conjecture.\\n\\n\r\nThis core represents the basis of nearly all thought: questioning and answering. For Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou, the main protagonists form a dichotomy insofar as the anime typically relegates them and their time to one of those sides. Yuuri is the questioner; Chito is the answerer. Yuuri is very simpleminded, but her frank honesty and unashamed questions invite a pure dive into everyday wonders that people generally take for granted. In turn, Chito attempts to explain these \u201cforeign\u201d topics, offering similarly simple answers which elucidate their overall complexity.\\n\\n\r\nTheir inquisitive nature begets the semi-philosophical edge which the show leans into for much of the season. Yuuri will take Chito\u2019s answers at face value, applying them in a straightforward manner for an out-of-the-box way of thinking. Chito will take Yuuri\u2019s questions as a sign of her reserved maturity to view their predicaments in a new light. Together, the contemplative conversations they exchange, from the small asides to the larger sit-down discussions, further characterize themselves and hearken back to that crucial motif on the value and the nuance life contains.\\n\\n\r\nLooking more so at their relationship, it\u2019s seemingly that of best friends, but a nugget of frustration and disparity exists on occasion. Calling it \u201canimosity\u201d or \u201chatred\u201d is not correct, yet the anime unfortunately refrains from truly testing their bond to discover otherwise. Emotions remain mostly stable over the course of Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokoueven as it scoots close to such interpersonal conflict. Ultimately though, and similarly to the story, the anime shies away from possible avenues, extreme or not. Yes, being friends is essentially an inevitability under such insane circumstances, but this missing challenge sticks out.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of friends, a certain patchy spider from a particular video game borne of blood can be quoted as saying, \u201cWhat is friendship, but a chance encounter?\u201d Such an \u201cuplifting\u201d statement applies to the friends which Chito and Yuuri happen to meet along the way.\\n\\n\r\nTheir brief stays combat the nihilism such a predicament would entail. A cartographer letting things go to start anew. A mechanic finding goodness in hardship and in failure. A zoologist learning about empathy, be it for man, fish, or robot. Arguably, the show doesn\u2019t tie back in these scarce side characters all that well, but it may be unfair to expect them to do so, especially when their encounters have given them memories, direction, and hope anyway.\\n\\n\r\nNo matter the case, Chito, Yuuri, and these friends prove that the human spirit lives on through sheer tenacity. It could be by thinking, or it could be by realizing the obvious. Either way, they\u2019re all an existence within the anime that surely improves the project.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC & SOUND\\n\\n\r\nFor Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou, it\u2019s imperative that the two leads Chito and Yuuri are as intriguing as possible since they are followed constantly and cannot have usual rapports with other side or supporting characters.\\n\\n\r\nWhich is why Inori Minase as Chito and Yurika Kubo as Yuuri lead the charge with a couple of strong voice-acting performances. Chito has a resigned cadence to her words that bring out a so-done-with-this attitude, and a carefree lilt for Yuuri stamps in her usual jokey self. They each boast a calmness to their voices, too, lending even further credit to their VA chops when the role demands a delicate touch for this tough in-universe habitat.\\n\\n\r\nThe original soundtrack follows suit with a diverse selection that does not interfere with the ladies or the grounded presentation but rather supplements the events with its purposeful music. Xylophones for the methodical sections; acoustic guitar strings and chords for those moments of reprieve; banging drums and quick drumlines for a can-do vibe. From the gentle pieces to the mild tunes to the depressing ensembles, the OST captures the mood and the beauty of the anime once again.\\n\\n\r\nBut chief among its aural landscape are those items which may not be strictly categorized as part of the normal music offerings. I.e., Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou smartly takes advantage of its story and of its medium when it creates signature moments inspired solely by the sound in the air.\\n\\n\r\nA reddened sunset overlaid with a choir-like radio channel comes to mind, but the plinking of rain on various objects during a storm manifests as a trifecta of perfection. It\u2019s very relatable, it morphs into an awesome song, and it follows the ideas and the intent of the show to the highest of degrees. It would not be a stretch to claim this chapter as one of the best parts in the whole anime.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the opening track and the ending track, they too deserve praise.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cUgoku, Ugoku\u201d aligns with its namesake as the steady beat and the reserved pacing move the song along. The techno, space-like sounds add a technological and mysterious edge that goes with the show, and the chiptune instrumentation instills a meta-regression that likewise befits the non-modern-day content. The \u201c1, 2, 3\u2026\u201d lyric is also a catchy inclusion with its surrounding, fuller portion of the track that sandwiches comfortably within the docile beginning and finishing segments of the OP.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cMore One Night\u201d targets a slightly different genre of music. This dance-party tune makes for a jovial conclusion to each episode, the quick repetition of the lyrics, the onomatopoeia, the piano, the bass, and the snapping making it almost mandatory to nod or to tap a foot to the song. It\u2019s a non-complex, straightforward ED that caps off the rest of the audio design in groovy fashion.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m not a religious person whatsoever, so I may be biased in my reasoning here, but the following dialogue exchange between Chito and Yuuri is one that I find encapsulates this series: \u201cWhat\u2019s a God?\u201d \u201cA god is like\u2026 I dunno.\u201d \u201cCan you eat it?\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nBefore hearing it, I was already quite enjoying the anime. After hearing it, I had a feeling I was going to view it all very favorably when it finished \u2013 and my hunch thankfully turned out to be correct.\\n\\n\r\nThat exchange and others had me engrossed during its run for two reasons: the laughs and the simplicity. Chito and Yuuri were often a couple of goofballs, their antics leading to a bunch of funny moments as they dealt with yet another obstacle and talked to each other on a regular basis. Yuuri and her hilarious lines. Chito and her deadpan stare. The two together getting by as best they can. They were a hoot and a gleeful pair.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it\u2019s a simple show. Deceptively simple. This description is a positive mark in my eyes, for it takes this simplicity and delivers a show on being and living and wondering. Interlaced within this drive is a ton of heart behind its actions, and the necessity for hope, while slightly saccharine for this setup, is a message that I certainly endorse and appreciate no matter which walk of life somebody happens to tread.\\n\\n\r\nShoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou flies to the top-tier level with enormous success. The thematic exploration in its story and the introspective angle in its characters are swell, and the production values for the entire anime uphold a beauty and a vigor that do not go unnoticed. Combined with an overall rewarding amount of entertainment, its prospects reach far above zilch.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Good, a dramatic, comedic, slice-of-life chimera whose museum of life- and life-lesson vignettes form a meaningful journey\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: Great, the majestic visuals for the setting, the smart artistic decisions for the fundamental elements, and the tailored designs for the narrative equate to an artistic treat\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, Chito and Yuuri are a classic brains-and-brawn pair who support each other, their inquisitive nature and their chance encounters along the way defining the tenacity of the human spirit\\n\\n\r\nMusic & Sound: Great, nice VA performances, a fantastic OST, signature audio moments, a nifty OP, and a dance-party ED bolster the audio with execution aplenty\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Great, gods cannot be eaten\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 9/10",

            "content": "SSR started off strong, it was intriguing to see a SoL show set in post-war wasteland about two girls  drifting through abandoned landscaped towards upper levels without a certain goal. It was promising when through dialogue and analogies the show set up themes about value and point of living. However that's kinda it, maybe there's something more to it in the manga but the show itself is painfully shallow. It's not void of neat little character moments that build up the main couple, make you sympathize with them and simultaneously feel the atmosphere they're immersed in. Despite that at any other point in timeI found myself incredibly bored cause nothing was happening, there was little to look at and dialogue while touching upon some interesting themes never really went beyond sort of mentioning that they exist in a very superficial way.\\n\\n\r\nWith dialogue that boring the saving grace could've been the adventure itself, if there's nothing to listen to maybe there's something to see. In that regard SSR offers occasionally very curious environments that bit by bit contribute to the bizarre world its set in. You have giant rows of file cabinets that have a bit of a dark meaning behind them, you have buildings standing on tall beams, factories made out of infinite tubes, occasional weird statues of something unknown with an unknown purpose. It's neat at first but usually the show offers too little to late to redeem anything with that. Doesn't help that color direction is extremely boring. I understand that it's hard to do much when your show revolves around burned out and crumbled cities and factories but it is possible, at the very least proper contrast is a must and they author of original manga must've knew that a bunch of boxes and squares don't make for a visually interesting environment.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending for obvious reasons is not exactly conclusive and there's nothing wrong with \"adventure goes on\" kind of endings but after basically nothing happened they kind of back loaded a lot of exposition and storytelling to the last episode so it's as if entirety of the show started and concluded there. Not knowing what a climax is wouldn't be too out of place for SSR though as each individual episode was also terribly paced. Sometimes I would check how much time went by and when I thought the episode must be coming to an end it usually turned out it's only about a halfway point. That is once again cause nothing happens and when it does it's stretched out so thin that it does't make much of a difference. That would've been fine if the show aimed to be relaxing but I didn't find it such cause it's not relaxing by default if you just watch at pretty landscapes or watch girls enjoy eating something or taking a bath, which happens weirdly often given the setting.\\n\\n\r\nSo in summary, I just think SSR was a bunch of wasted potential, if it wasn't trying something new it would probably get a 4 from me at most but at least there was an attempt.",

            "content": "This show is probably the best \"Slice of Life\" show I have watched. With barely anything even contesting it for that title. Almost every aspect is engaging and really interesting and is surprisingly still engaging and fun to watch. I am usually entirely averse to Slice of Life shows because I will admit that I don't like to watch things that are almost intentionally \"chill\" or \"relaxing\" unless I'm trying to sleep. However, this show presents some very unique philosophies and ideas that are extremely interesting and has 2 main characters that are absolutely phenomenal. The limited supporting cast is also beyond well done andall of their individual tales are extremely interesting.\\n\r\nThis show also does the \"cute\" thing really really well with every single emote that the two main characters make is memorable and visually hilarious.\\n\r\nAnother thing to commend the show on is its music. From the mysterious tune on the radio to the rain bucket song to the amazing OP and ED, this show has its music down pat.\\n\r\nThe philosophy of \"Getting along with the hopelessness\" is also extremely interesting, even though it isn't the only theme present. Other well-done themes include the effects of war, the meaning of life, and other pretty grand ideas for such a small scale story. \\n\\n\r\nEverything this show does (excluding the \"Rain\" story which I was personally bored by.) is absolutely enchanting and deserves a much higher rank than it has. I suggest this to EVERYONE, even if you don't like Slice of Life shows like me because this show is absolutely beautiful.",

            "content": "They say that it\u2019s always the journey, not the destination.  Often times, we seek something in our lives only for it to eventually fade away as we wither and die, leaving behind only the memory of who we once were in a world that we go on without us.  In a world left as a shell of its former self, two girls take their last tour into the wide, open world.  \r\n(The only real important part of the review is at the very end in \u2018Personal Enjoyment\u2019, if you want to skip to it.)\r\nStory:\r\nYuuri and Chito are two young girls who ridearound on a hybrid vehicle of a motorbike and a tank.  (Also known as a Kettenkrad)  Through their days, they wander the wide-open world from a world left long ago.  \\n\\n\r\nSummed up in roughly two sentences, the simple story of these two girls wandering this vast, empty world is minimalism at its finest, expressing its twelve episodes through show, don\u2019t tell, as each episode is split into several smaller parts where the duo takes into account the present situation at hand.  Be it regarding food, the environment around them, or the few life forms still left in this empty world, Shuumatsu is in a word, depressingly blissful. \\n\\n\r\nBehind its mysterious atmosphere surrounding questions asking what this world is and what happened prior to these girls spending their days wandering, to the surprising discoveries and excitement these girls make when even the simplest things that we in our lives take for granted shows up in front of them, very few things can honestly be said critically both good or bad about a show that drowns the viewer in awe from the kinds of things we\u2019re presented.  It comes to a point that sometimes words can\u2019t really explain it and the phrase \u201cjust go watch it for yourself\u201d comes to mind.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Simple, yet very, very atmosphere\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nAs for the girls themselves, both Chito and Yuuri exhibit opposite traits to each other that provide a nice contrast to one another.  Chito is levelheaded and thinks more with her head, whereas Yuuri is slightly psychopathic and thinks more with her stomach, constantly talking about food in a world where finding it can prove to be a challenge.  \\n\\n\r\nAside from them\u2026the few characters we do get only bolster the image of a world on its last legs.  Beings who sit there, grasping at straws to give themselves a goal, something, anything to do to give them a purpose in a seemingly empty and meaningless place.  It\u2019s surreal and really makes you think when put into perspective the human nature and how we as a species spend so much time running around to survive in a bustling or starving place.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Simple, yet effective characters\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nProduced by White Fox, the show gives us this drab yet stunningly beautiful landscape that speaks volumes more than the dialogue ever will.  Landscape, wide shots, establishing, low angle, top down, crane; as the viewer, we\u2019re privy to see this gorgeously depressing sprawling ruin of a city that stretches for miles on end.  Not often is the show\u2019s landscapes and art direction this key to the show\u2019s overall existence and feel as it is here.  With every episode we\u2019re introduced to something new in the world of Shuumatsu, and every time it becomes a guessing game of:\\n\\n\r\n\u201cWhy is it like this?\u201d  \\n\\n\r\n\u201cWho made these?\u201d  \\n\\n\r\n\u201cWhat happened to this place?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nAll of which are answers that are intentionally left out and left to our own imaginations.  The few clues we\u2019re given catalyze the viewer to at least start thinking about the possibilities and add more wonder to what led to what to create the result we see.  \\n\\n\r\nComparatively, it\u2019s interesting to note the blob-like design that the girls have, which add a surprisingly humorous contrast to the bleakness of the world they live in as they scoot along on their Kettenkrad.  Sure they\u2019re simple, but surprisingly enough, it does actually work with the rest of the show\u2019s style.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Breathtaking scenery\\n\r\n+  Ironically? hilarious character designs\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nBoth the show\u2019s OP and ED are sung by the seiyuus of the two girls, which are both ironically cheerful and happy, poppy and surprisingly memorable tracks with vaguely depressing lyrics that add a hilarious contrast to how the actual show plays out.  \\n\\n\r\nBut the true winner is how the rest of the OST plays out.  Each track in the show presents us with a simple or awe-inspiring track with only a small handful of instruments and/or voices that show us that you don\u2019t need a huge symphony or choir to create a huge impact.  Kenchiro Suehiro\u2019s work is a sublime piece of art that gives us the gentle push of subtlety just enough to make the audience resonate with what\u2019s happening on the screen.  If you don\u2019t believe me, listen to it for yourself.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Stellar soundtrack\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nWhen I do a review for a show, I tend to spend my free time thinking over what I watched about a week prior to the last episode and determine the show\u2019s positives and negatives in an impartial judgment that leads me to analyze any given show the way I\u2019ve formatted these reviews for years.  Very rarely for one of these reviews do I sit at my desk at a loss for words.  There\u2019s a certain beauty to the show\u2019s bleakness that I cannot describe, a certain wonderment that I cannot accurately put into words.  Watching Shuumatsu sort of got me thinking what would life be like in a world without us around, what our lives would be like when an eerily quiet serenity took over the world and froze the things around us in an eternal slumber.  What would our purpose be for those that remain?  Like sometimes I wonder why I put out these reviews.  You know, trains of thought like that.  \\n\\n\r\nDid I like this show?\\n\\n\r\nQuite honestly, I\u2019m not sure what I feel.  It\u2019s certainly not showing distaste towards the show, but it\u2019s more of me being stuck in awe and wonder at the nature of it all.  It seems like nothing at first, but when you watch it, it\u2019s everything.  It\u2019s so simple, but it gives you so many things that pop up so many questions in your head that you can\u2019t help but beg the show to give you some answers.  But that\u2019s part of the beauty of it.  We like the girls have almost no idea what this world they\u2019re traveling through is, what secrets it holds, what will happen in the future, or even what the point of living in a world where nothing you do matters because no one will be around to see it, if you\u2019re remembered at all.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat didn\u2019t I like about this show?\\n\\n\r\nYuuri\u2019s\u2026kind of a dick.  Yeah, I\u2019m calling her out on that.  She\u2019s kind of a terrible person for most of the show.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this show?\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re not a fan of atmosphere and want some kind of oomph to your show, then Shuumatsu isn\u2019t for you.  If you don\u2019t mind a show devoted to its atmosphere, man, you\u2019re in for a treat with this one.  Quite honestly, there isn\u2019t a lot about this show to be said because of how beautifully simple it all is, and just how difficult it is to put into words.  It\u2019s one of those things that I would highly, highly suggest you go watch yourself because it\u2019s a show that has to be experienced than told about, and really deserves more attention because of how rare a show this deep in its atmosphere appears.    \\n",

            "content": "There were two shows that I frequently found myself comparing and contrasting to Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou (Girls\u2019 Last Tour) throughout my watch of it. They both aired this year, which is probably why they were fresh enough in my mind that I kept making these comparisons. These shows are Kemono Friends and Made in Abyss. All three of these shows have in common the theme of putting cute, sometimes naive characters in a gloomy setting that\u2019s full of mystery.\r\nThe level of gloom highly varies between these three shows. While Made in Abyss didn\u2019t hold back from showing the dangers of its world and even depictedon-screen brutality at times, Kemono Friends kept its darker elements entirely as undertones, the show being overwhelmingly child-friendly. Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou falls somewhere in the middle: Chito and Yuuri\u2019s world clearly isn\u2019t as innocent from the beginning as the one in Kemono Friends may appear to be, but it\u2019s not overwhelmingly dark, nor is there much of a sense of threat or danger in most scenes. I\u2019ve heard some refer to it as a \u201cpost-apocalyptic Aria\u201d, which is definitely a good comparison.\\n\\n\r\nOur two main characters, Chito and Yuuri, are charming, cute girls with very contrasting personalities that the show likes to show off. Chito works as the true leader of their partnership, having the ability to read and write, while Yuuri is the seemingly fearless and naive \u201cbrawn\u201d of the duo. (She\u2019s not completely unaware or delusional about what\u2019s going on but like Yuki in Gakkougurashi!, but simply always is able to look on the bright side.) There are some very interesting scenes in the series that suggest that perhaps Chito is envious of how naive, easygoing, and fearless Yuuri is. It reminds me of a quote from The Great Gatsby: \u201cAnd I hope she\u2019ll be a fool - that\u2019s the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, the show isn\u2019t all gloomy. Much like Kemono Friends and Made in Abyss, Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou has some moments of slapstick and comedy that are sure to put a smile on your face and maybe make you forget for a second how bleak the world Chito and Yuuri live in is.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is great. Every piece of music is set with the mood and the atmosphere in the scene in a similar way to Made in Abyss. Once you get past the dabbing in the OP, it\u2019s a flawless catchy tune.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the show isn\u2019t perfect. My main issue with Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou is the fact that most of the time, nothing\u2019s happening. I sometimes struggled to recall significant events that had occurred in past episodes, simply because nothing seems that significant. You could probably sum up everything that happens in eleven out of the twelve episodes of the series over a single paragraph. Kemono Friends and Made in Abyss both kept my full attention by their sense of danger/threat and the way that the mystery was unveiled throughout these shows. At times, the show feels like something an English teacher would assign to you, along with questions to help you think about/understand the material. (Don't get me wrong; if it were a book you had to read in English class, it would be one of the better ones!)\\n\\n\r\nHowever, when the show decides it\u2019s time to unwrap at least a portion of itself for the viewer, it makes the payoff of a slow-paced journey all that much better. Even still, some questions are left unanswered that leave plenty of room for a season 2. My score was on a 7/8 borderline for the majority of the show, but I ultimately decided on an 8. I loved Chito and Yuuri and would watch a season 2 in a heartbeat.\\n",

            "content": "Girls Last Tour will take the viewer on a tour of a dead civilization with 2 cute girls. This is one of those hidden gems that you find while browsing random anime. I think that this show should get more attention than what it currently has.\r\nFirst of all, the story is not that deep. It's just 2 girls who are driving around on a kettenkrad on a desolate land full of snow. The story isn't really important in the case of this anime though, and they managed to nail everything else besides the story.\r\nThe art style of this anime is one of the things thata lot of people praise. A dead civilization offers so much potential for scenery and that is what White Fox took advantage of. The scenery is just so beautiful and everywhere the girls go just feels so dead. Calling something dead might be a negative quality for other anime but that is what this anime is aiming for and they nailed it.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is also another factor which makes this anime so good. The opening theme is so good that if you put me in a torture room and force me to listen to it for 3 days, I would actually thank you. (Actually, don't do it.) The sound was directed so well that it fits the theme of the anime which is hard to do because the theme is literally about nothing. The voice acting is also good but I think that they can do better than what they have recorded so far.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough it might seem like I like everything about this anime, One thing I don't like about it is the characters. Watching them feels like I'm just watching 2 rocks driving a vehicle. They talk slowly and they don't really project a lot of personalities. That is to be expected though since they grew up knowing that civilization is dead. They are good enough to fit the plot but I think that they can be polished further, and I believe that they will be.\\n\\n\r\nFor enjoyment, it all comes down to the taste of the viewer. A lot of people have the patience to watch this without doing anything else, however, it just doesn't immerse me enough for me to be the same. In fact, I can't even watch 6 episodes without looking through my phone at least once because some of the scenes just move too slow.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would recommend this to those who would literally watch anything just to kill time. The sound is good so I guess I'd also recommend it to people who like Japanese songs. I wouldn't suggest it though to people who prefer anime that has something moving every frame because they would just get bored with this anime anyways.\\n\\n\r\nIt's an enjoyable anime and I really hope that more people would appreciate it.",

I think it's also because the characters aren't good enough and ill get to it. overall, the plot isn't what it needs to be nor is good enough for this show.\\n\\n\r\ncharacters (5/10):\\n\r\nthe characters aren't good enough. there is almost no character development nor are they something really good. I like chito a bit and I hate yuu. the supporting (which isn't usually there) was good and I liked it. I feel like the characters were needed to be written better for this show to be a really good one. overall, the characters are no more than fine and bad a times. \\n\\n\r\noverall (8/10):\\n\r\nso if you noticed it doesn't look like the show should have 8 as an overall score. why then? because this is a philosophical show with really interesting ideas. the ideas it tries to convey are really interesting and at times are even close to me. unfortunately the show fails in conveying most of it's ideas in a way that will actually make me think about them or care about it. I know a lot of the people watching this show will give it a 10/10 or stuff like that because the show is deep but this is wrong. you shouldn't just give the highest score to a show if it's deep. I added something like 1 point to the show overall score because you don't see a lot of shows like it and because it's interesting ideas but I wish the show would have been better at conveying the ideas and make you care about them. \\n\r\nso do I recommend the show? sure. it's nice. if you look for something deep then this show is good. but don't expect too much out of it. expect to these ideas there isn't much to the show.\\n",

Well, as I have discovered with this wonderful, wonderful anime, an very slow-paced story isn\u2019t necessarily bad, as long as what little progression displayed is done in the right way.\r\nSTORY\r\nAs of episode 10, there is very little real plot, and the story doesn\u2019t seem to be progressing much in most episodes. However, there are hints that suggest that this anime is, in fact, going to end up progressing background information on how the world ended. But as for now, there\u2019s the occasional reference toprevious episodes, but other than that, it\u2019s mostly mini-plots following our protagonists\u2019 shenanigans. But that\u2019s not a bad thing; just look at episode 5\u2019s Sound of Rain, which has, through some odd phenomenon, become my second favorite episode (or in this case, part of an episode) of this season, only being beaten out by Made in Abyss episode 1.\\n\\n\r\nART\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m by no means adept at art critique, yet I can tell you that the art fits the world and the characters spectacularly, with the occasional 3DCGI fitting in decently (or at least, not jarringly) with the rest of the art.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nAs far as I could tell, the sound design was good, but not noteworthy, with a few notable exceptions such as the aforementioned Sound of Rain story.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThis, being a cute girls doing cute things anime, naturally has cute girls who do cute things. The two main characters are the infinitely likeable Chito and Yuuri, two girls who are bored when not trying to survive after the end of the world or travelling. \\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION\\n\\n\r\nSo, this anime is great and all. However, I do have at least one bit of confusion that needs clarification.\\n\\n\r\nIn the OP, the girls \u2018dab.\u2019 However, when presented with Chocolate-flavored rations, they were confused as to what chocolate was. Therefore, is it logical to conclude that the \u2018dab\u2019 outlasted chocolate? If so, in my own personal opinion, that world deserved whatever they got.",

So there's an obvious appeal to the wehraboo's community we all know exists. Yet not once do they address that back story of this. What happened to thier unit? What happened to thier home? None of this is looked at while they absently look through vacant cities. I'd obviously be a bit disturbed if literally everything just died and vanish around me.\r\nThesecond glaring issue is that these cities lack any clear concept of thier destruction - theres no bones, there's no damage. The downed aircraft in the first episode lets you on to think there will be more to talk about, yet this totally abandoned. Where is the immersion?\\n\\n\r\nCharacter wise, they're pretty standard minus a few quirks. Chito is an idiot and if i worked with her, i'd question is she's even a bit slow. She's like 16 years old if not older, and cant figure out why noise echos in a metal box. People say \"trust\", but in episode one, CHITO POINTS A GUN AT HER AND ROBS HER FRIEND FOR A CHOCOLATE BAR. At that point, i'd say no, I am done. Good-bye. This clings to the back of my mind for the rest of the story. How could you ever trust someone like that again?\\n\\n\r\nSo wrapping it up, the story feels numb, uninviting, and contradictory. Its not terrible, but in my opinion, its not that good.",

            "content": "It is the quiet and understated lives of these two characters that Girl's Last Tour drifts after and in its wake it drags me; an exhausted and perpetually busy college student. I'm so glad it did.\r\nGLT was stunning, there's no other way to put it. Hyperbole is unnecessary in describing a work of genius, villains and long running plots are equally irrelevant in creating one apparently. Yes, the plot is barebones, it only follows the two leads as they wander somewhat aimlessly and hopelessly alone through a vast and unexplained world. However, this show makes the viewer care so much about so little. It's notjust the cuteness factor (although that is there re:potato faces), Chi and Yuu are intensely relatable and endearing. I was invested in a very short time and their day to day life was as compelling as any battle packed action story. That is the crux of what works. Life is a day to day struggle full of unexplained phenomena, constant self doubt and mundanities. GLT recognises this and is so sincere in its depiction that boredom is an afterthought for the viewer. Not to say the episodic storytelling is plain, on the contrary it is colourful and very entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nThe setting is key here in evoking this pathos. The awesome and superbly vast nature of the surroundings provides a stark dichotomy to the lifelessness of the world and thus the isolation of the girls. Some truly inspired aesthetic choices, such as slanted city structures and strange magnificent devices, lend an always interesting backdrop and in their dwarfing of the small deuteragonists enhance the evocation of loneliness. I am drawn to the silence of their surroundings, the hints at unexplored depths and grand mysteries. I want so bad to see more of this world, enough that even were I not to give a shit about the pair (which is not the case at all) I'd still watch on like an idiot just to catch a glimpse of more; namely the unknown and what could be. That is storytelling. That is a setting worthy of this show.\\n\\n\r\nLet me not fail to praise this show further. the characters and their philosophy are what truly kept me watching. They aren't just cute, they're individuals. Each stand on their own and the comedy (and passion) sparks from how they work off each other. Yuu's single mindedness and determined philosophy contrasts both comedically and dramatically with Chi's practicality, doubt filled nature and tendency to introspection. GLT constantly asks the question, what gives life meaning? More obviously, what is the point? Well this anime and these characters find meaning or at least enough of it to pursue living in their long odyssey. They take comfort in each other, in simply living. Other philosophical abstractions are considered but I won't get bogged down in all of them, safe to say they aren't ever trite or cliche. \\n\\n\r\nWhat aids this relationship and their mediations is a beautiful and melancholic OST. It's much like the snow that falls, or the rain that clamours; natural and vagarious. When it's used, it is used in synchronicity with the scenes. Whether to encourage fear, sadness or wonderment, there is no sense of insincerity. In particular, certain ways they incorporate music is ingenious. \\n\\n\r\nThere are other technical factors to delve into but I'm no expert and would probably only muddy or poorly relate them. Suffice to say this show is expertly crafted. It is sad at times, elusive and occasionally frightening, yet is also pure and magnanimous. It soothed me and empathised with me. GLT is adorable and relatable and I goddamn adore it.",

            "content": "How could I imagine that Slice of Life and very serious issues like postwar worlds would work together? Girls' Last Tour is one of the best anime I've ever seen, not counting the best of 2017 (which it is) because I saw it the following year. If it was an anime involving a post-apocalyptic world, post-war, I after seeing the first episode was already expecting a confrontation that would have between Chito and Yuuri against someone or something, but did not have. At most it was Yuuri's \"betrayal\" of Chito and the creature devouring Yuu in the last episode.\r\nThe anime leaves a complete suspense in11 of the 12 episodes being the last one the episode that explained * almost * everything. What makes up the \"almost\" is my doubt that has never been clarified in the series, which is: If anime takes place around the 2300's to 2400's, why and how both use and carry equipment and weapons of World War II? In comparison, it would be like if I chose to use muskets from the 1600's instead of the weapons we have today.\\n\\n\r\nFor those who complain about the designs I think this is one of the trademarks of this anime. They are only applied in the two main ones. All other human characters have standard traits of standard animes. I love seeing the faces of the two deforming as they savor the hot tub. Not to mention the expression that Chito does, just remembering always makes me laugh inside.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of soundtrack, Girls' Last Tour has the BEST SOUNDTRACK OF ALL THE ANIMES (that I watched). The theme song is angelic, immersive, unique, although it recalls the soundtrack of a game that is another masterpiece, Journey (2012). Creating a song with sound effects of drops falling on metal surfaces was great, representing a thousand and one things. Before they found the radio, the Yuuri sings(very, VERY kawaii) and the symbolic scene of the raindrops falling in cans was all that the two had as example of music.\\n\\n\r\nThe manga I did not read and maybe I will not even read if it dont' have at least English. But I already imagine that it is good or better than the anime.",

            "content": "The apocalypse has never been so delightful.\r\nI'm an avid fan of post-apocalyptic stories. I love Tsutomu Nihei\u2019s \u201cBlame!\u201d, Stephen King's \"The Stand\", and Cormac McCarthy's \"The Road\". I've also repeatedly re-watched Texhnolyze and Casshern Sins, two of my favorite anime. As I progressed through them, I always felt an enjoyment for the pure desolation and hopelessness of the atmospheres. Even in the stories themselves, I like discussing (with myself) the philosophy of the depressing situations and finding all kinds of cynical meaning in the characters' actions. But Girls' Last Tour did for me what no other post-apocalyptic story could ever do: warm my heart.\r\nI'll beginwith the characters. In the shortest description, there's Chii-chan, a deadpan yet sensible girl, traveling with Yuu, a lovable airhead. What I've noticed many other anime tend to do is shove the personalities of the characters in the viewers' faces. They hold our hands and insist to us, \"THIS character is really emo and that's because ____\" and \"THIS character is very cheerful and that's because ____\", etc. It is rare that the writers simply let the characters be human and let the viewers see for themselves who the characters are. Girls' Last Tour is one of those successes. In every situation they came across, Chito and Yuuri showed HUMAN from their characters. This factor (and it is the most important one in this cast) is what brings me to relate to a character and want to see more of them. Then, like usual, what made me love the characters were the bits of their charming personalities scattered all over the story: Yuu finding pleasure in finding a nice stick, Chii-chan love for books and record-keeping, and the dysfunctional interactions between the duo. This realness with a touch of idiosyncracies is what makes a character touch me most. \\n\\n\r\nTo me, the side characters in Girls\u2019 Last Tour were handled perfectly. I\u2019ve noticed that when characters in post-apocalyptic stories find allies and form groups, it takes away the feeling of isolation from it all. I think, most of the time, this takes uniqueness away from the atmosphere of those stories. Girls\u2019 Last Tour avoids this with much thanks to the episodic nature of the series. Yes, the main duo finds other characters and friends on their journey, but they never last TOO long before they\u2019re back off the screen. I liked seeing Chii-chan and Yuu meet others on occasion, having to part with them sooner than expected; nothing more. In fact, that is also the essence of a well-done slice-of-life anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe writer of Girls\u2019 Last Tour (or in this case, our mangaka Tsukumizu) is wonderful at crafting stories. Every episode was filled with discovery about the desolate world around these two girls, with something new to learn every time. I was moved by not only the individual stories among the episodes, but also the things revealed about the mysterious world these girls are traveling in. Nothing was boring to me either, and that\u2019s often a hard point to earn in the slice-of-life genre. To top it off, topics of philosophy were discussed now and then by the characters which I always appreciate hearing. It wasn\u2019t pretentious either; I very much enjoyed seeing the girls talk about the meanings behind what has happened in their world. I think this anime found a wonderful way to spark discussion about life and humanity through the medium of, extraordinarily enough, chibi girls.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack and art of Girls\u2019 Last Tour work together to build this alluring, beautiful, wonderful experience. It\u2019s so hard to put it into words, but I\u2019ll try.\\n\\n\r\nComposer Kenichiro Suehiro uses chorus-style vocals and strings to capture the spirit of the girls\u2019 journey. Nearly every track in the score is breathtaking; it contributes so much charm to the unique mood of this post-apocalyptic story. What comes from the mix of graceful music and the isolated situation of the characters is a bittersweet feeling that got planted deep in my chest, and I find that to be truly genius.\\n\\n\r\nI think the character designs were, setting the memes aside, a great idea to put in a bleak story like this. Yuuri and Chiito\u2019s kiddie-ness complemented the vast and barren landscapes of their world to create that same bittersweet feeling I mentioned before. And those landscapes\u2014holy cow. The boundless fields of towering structures, all painted over with blacks and grays\u2026 the dry, bleak, giant cities with nothing but emptiness and solitude\u2026 unknown objects scattered throughout this mysterious world\u2026 this is the epitome of a magnificent post-apocalyptic setting. And here there are two little girls questing through the scene, looking for hope. Girls\u2019 Last Tour is a tale that none other can compare to.\\n\\n\r\nYou can see why I enjoyed Girls\u2019 Last Tour so much, but I\u2019ll sum it up anyways. Stories about the apocalypse always focus on the despair and the barrenness of the situation, and I love them for that. But Girls\u2019 Last Tour took that and put two charming girls in the scene, setting them out to find purpose and faith. The desolate scenery stands in their way, and the sentimental soundtrack accompanies them. Although the isolation of this kind of story is still present, the girls don\u2019t fight; they embrace something akin to acceptance. It moves me to tears sometimes. I can\u2019t explain it well enough, so perhaps Yuu, with her pleasant smile, said it best:\\n\\n\r\n\u201cMaybe she\u2019s getting along with it now\u2026 with the feeling of hopelessness.\u201d\\n",

It's certainly unconventional by traditional standards, but there's also a quality to it that's hard to look away from.\r\n\"Comfy\" is the word of the day, and Girl's Last Tour is committed to the idea regardless of how you feel about it. Not a lot happens on an episode-to-episode basis, but it's all thickly atmospheric. You're mostly invited to take in the bleak scenery while the characters muse on some light philosophy. Not that therearen't regular beats of comedy, moe, and even action, but the broad impression is still a very quiet one.\\n\\n\r\nThis makes the show very easily enjoyable, but not much more than that. It's an easy way to chill out, and that may be all that you want, but it makes it a bit light on the ground for those expecting something more substantial. However, every once in a while everything comes together into some truly incredible moments. Episode 8 is the absolute peak of this, and there are a few others scattered throughout the series. For these glimpses of brilliance hidden inside the comfy, contemplative whole, I'd say Girl's Last Tour is worth a shot.",

            "content": "The poster of the two adorable girls compelled me to start watching, but it was the subtleties of the anime and its philosophical content that kept me attentive for the whole twelve episodes (plowed through it in one sitting).\r\nStarting off with a very intriguing setting in which two young girls with polar personalities are exploring an abandoned edifice in a quintessential post-apocalyptic world, the story then develops in a very slow-paced manner. The general notion of the story is crystal clear, but the lack of chronology adds the element of curiosity and surprise to the story. The two girls kept on moving forward on theirmotorbike with no fixed agenda while having short encounters with other people who are also trying to cope up with the fallen world by pursuing their dreams. Each of these encounters affirms the tenacity that humans have in their will to live and not succumbing to fate despite the nigh upcoming demise of the world. \\n\\n\r\nAs the story progresses, the secrets of the world are uncovered little by little. This anime hints and forecasts the possible consequences of scientific innovation that can be easily misused for warfare through political means and human greed. It is appropriate for this anime to be released in this time of political unrest and instability, as it is the need of the hour for leading governments to contemplate about investing in nuclear powers for the sake of maintaining the so-called elusive \u201cpeace\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, a myriad of other notions is present in this anime, some apparent while some remaining hidden to the general eye. It is interesting how the author can knead so many ideas and present it in the form of an enjoyable story. A very apparent notion is that of empathy. While the characters fail to fathom the true meaning of empathy in the practical sense, they still make conjectures about what they truly are. \\n\\n\r\nAs a pianist, I never turn a deaf ear towards good music. The background music of this anime accentuates the anime\u2019s melancholic setting and creates the much-needed suspense. I tip off my hat to the composer that could create pieces that really brought the anime to a whole new level. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, this anime constantly made me think there is much more than what meets the eye, but I think that the true value of the film comes more from self-reflection. After watching this anime, I began to contemplate how I am going to go about my life. It left a very big mark on my heart that I wouldn\u2019t mind forgetting this anime just to experience it all over again. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Humans are cruel, aren't they?\r\nChito and Yuuri roams the unknown part of the dying earth in an unknown aftermath aimlessly. Scavenge rations, clean water, fuel, and other things then put them in the Kettenkrad - that's what you get when you mixed a motorbike with a german halftrack - and take the trip to nowhere. Chi and Yuu has no certain goal, but one each other is now the only thing they have left.\r\nLet me tell you that i ever have a problem about depression and it might affect how i write this review. But i learned how to control my emotions right now somy depression wouldn't really made me think to suicide though.\\n\\n\r\nI personally think this anime is the best* anime that really criticize anything about, war, nature, environment, and... humanity, like friendship, love, empathy, compassion, and others. (*Best, based on the anime that i already watched). I was also surprised that Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou (Last Girls' Trip) is the only slice of life anime that drive my to tears after Nichijou (My Ordinary Life). both 10 for me. I could say this because that i only watch Slice of Life anime and i can distinguish diffrences between animes with the same genre.\\n\\n\r\nI don't know if this is a spoiler or not, but in the end i consider it isn't, the only main characters are Chi and Yuu. And also, i will not spoil how many characters directly involved in this anime. Just imagine.\\n\\n\r\nThe places showcased in this anime generally came from the unknown culture of postmodern earth. No terrain or ocean is seen (except in imagination), and instead, the whole place is made out of metals, maybe steels, and concrete. The only things exists are stacked platforms. with a really tall gap between platforms. Since the whole thing is made out of metal and concrete, the colors you seen in the anime are dark camo green, gray, deep navy blue, and other set of really faded and grayish colors. Triggers your emotions.\\n\\n\r\nThere are 12 Episodes, and surprisingly the wiki (on Wikia) drew them into a world map based on Chi and Yuu's position on certain chapters. The duration took in the story (for the whole episode) is maybe just so long, because it changes season every one or two episodes. Or, maybe, it may be caused by the destroyed earth so the climate became abnormal.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, there is a part where you start to contemplate about humanity. The orchestra song Nocturnes, Op. 9 (Chopin) is featured there and make you really really ponder about it. If you are a Muse (British alternative rock band) fan, you know that the album \"Resistance\" really fit this anime, and especially because Muse also feature the slightly rearrange Nocturnes, Op. 9 named \"Collateral Damage\". I'm sorry if i had to explain things other than anime, but you gotta know that the whole album talks about war, nature, environment, and humanity. So if you already listened the whole album, the contemplation effect will be as twice as effective for this part.\\n\\n\r\nI get depressed beyond that point. However, the relation between Yuu and Chi will heal you eventually.\\n\\n\r\nThere are several points that i used to distinguish whether a Slice of Life anime is good or not:\\n\r\n> Slow Paced : YES (i mean, like, there nothing in this anime that will scare you to death by a sudden, shocking transitions that possibly triggers epilepsy or heart attack.)\\n\r\n> Emotional: YES, especially the last ep.\\n\r\n----> ... Suspense : YES\\n\r\n----> ... Tears : YES\\n\r\n----> ... Elated : YES\\n\r\n> Good Songs : Overall, YES\\n\r\n----> ... BGM is slow paced too: YES\\n\r\n----> ... BGM is overall voiceless : maybe yes. Most of them are only hums though.\\n\r\n----> ... Memorable OP and ED: YES for both.\\n\r\n> Good Story: Overall, YES\\n\r\n----> ... Great and structural character building in the first episodes: YES\\n\r\n----> ... Logical: maybe yes. Nobody knows how post-apocalypse looked like.\\n\r\n----> ... Continuous : YES.\\n\r\n----> ... Good ratio of for the portion of the number of characters to the plot: YES\\n\r\n----> ... Plot Twists : few, but good.\\n\r\n----> ... Arguable conflict: maybe yes.\\n\r\n----> ... Surprises: You really think i am going to say it?\\n\r\n> You find yourself is attached soo deep in the movie: OMFG YES.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading.",

            "content": "Girl's Last Tour is the kind of anime you are either going to find excruciatingly boring or are going to fall head over heels in love with. Based on my score, you can probably tell which camp I am in. The show is a slow-paced post apocalyptic slice of life show with philosophical overtones and a constant sense of melancholy contentedness. It concerns two girls who have embarked on a \"last tour\" of what remains of the world.\r\nIf you are looking for a heavily plot-focused series, this is not the place to look. A complaint I have seen leveled against this show by its criticsis the fact that, to some degree, nothing happens. Sure, various small events happen over the course of an episode, but they never really build up to anything truly major. Where some consider this to be a flaw, I consider it to be one of the show's greatest strengths. Girl's Last Tour is not a plot-focused show, but instead heavily invested in mood and themes. The theme of finding joy and meaning when sorrow and hopelessness are all around is emphasized throughout every episode, and this is best shown through the often mundane actions taken by the characters. The show is not flashy or complex, but instead quiet and subtle. Obviously this is not to everyone's tastes, but I found it quite captivating.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to characters, the two leads Chito and Yuuri make a very effective duo. They come across as representing the two halves of the human spirit- Chito is serious, thoughtful, and melancholic while Yuuri acts in a much more lighthearted, optimistic, and carefree manner. While the two clash frequently over minor things throughout the series, it is ultimately shown that neither can live without the other- both sides are essential for every person. Their interactions range from comedic to thoughtful to truly heartfelt, and I enjoyed every second.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in the series is excellent, truly creating a world that is bleak and yet hopeful. The very moe character designs, a point of criticism from some, in my opinion contrast perfectly with the gloom that surrounds our main characters, emphasizing their warmth and humanity in the surrounding wasteland. The backgrounds are often gorgeous to look at, and the attention payed to little details truly makes the world come alive.\\n\\n\r\nThe music from the series may be its strongest point. Kenichiro Suehiro's amazing soundtrack perfectly reflects the mood of the show- it is sorrowful and melancholic, yet quietly optimistic. It is often unstated, yet powerful. I have sought out the soundtrack and listened to it outside of my viewings of the show and enjoyed it just as much, a testament to its quality. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I cannot recommend Girl's Last Tour highly enough if you are looking for a mellow yet thoughtful and enjoyable anime. The atmosphere and themes of the show more than make up for any lack of plot, painting a sadly beautiful picture of the world's end.",

            "content": "You Know it took me a little while to figure out just how i was going to talk about this series. Because unlike any other series I've reviewed so far. \"Girls' Last Tour\" doesn't have a designated story plot, that I can explain at length or go into heavy detail on. Instead what we have is the story of two young girls and their day to day lives and discoveries as they travel through a post apocalyptic world.\r\nNow that being said, the scripting and writing does a good job, when it comes to relaying the realism and relevancy of the story. As a lot ofthe the conversations our two little rays of sunshine Chi and Yui have together,  are what would be considered really appropriate for the theme and setting the series provides us with. Such as, survival, hopelessness, wondering if there's even a meaning to their journey, and even questioning the meaning of life. \\n\\n\r\n\"Girls' Last Tour\" normally has a lighthearted feel to it most of the time. But there are some parts of the series, that offer a since of mystery and others that can be found to be truly moving. \\n\\n\r\nNow on the subject of characters, other than our two little rays of sunshine Chi and Yui there are some minor supporting characters that get introduced. However they don't tend to stick around for more then one episode each so I can't really go into any detail on them. There's also talk of the girls' grandfather through out the series, who remains introduced. And I guess you could say that Girls' Last Tour is a lot like Kino's Journey in how it deals with travel and exploration just with out the drama.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs which were done by Toda Mai really let you fall in love \\n\r\n with the characters allowing you to empathize and feel for our girls as they continue on their journey. Which suited the series perfectly for the setting and theme that it has. I honestly believe that if any other character design had been used, that the series wouldn't of been able to capture those desired feelings to well. \\n\\n\r\nNow the animation on the other hand was handled by studio White Fox, who has an amazing track record for many works including, Steins Gate and Re:Zero. And speaking of amazing the end theme is absolutely incredible.\\n\\n\r\nFirst off it's a beautiful sketched animation done by the original creator of the manga source Tsukumizu. And the theme song \"More one night\" fits the series perfectly as the lyrics sung by our girls express how even though their situation may look hopeless they still have each other.  I know this because I created a video review on my channel about the series where I translated the ED. You can check the video out below.\\n\\n\r\n-->https://youtu.be/t4CY3oNnqvE\\n\\n\r\n\"Girls' Last Tour\" has one the most delightful soundtracks that I have had the pleasure of listening to. There are a lot of very calming and beautiful musical scores used through out the series which enhances the all around experience and investment that the viewer has in each scene. And as we all know music plays an extremely important part when it comes to creating a scene. It's that pull that makes us not want to look away when the protagonist is about to kiss the best girl. It's the dramatic sound score that we hear mixed with a very intense battle action scene. \\n\\n\r\nBut my personal favorite track from the series is the song of rain. \\n\\n\r\nAll around  \"Girls' Last Tour\" is a great watch for anyone who is looking for a lighthearted adventure, with some very adorable and lovable characters.\\n\r\nNow the only critique I have for the series, is the story could of used a little drama to further enhance the emotional investment we have in Chi and Yui as our main characters. \\n\\n\r\nNow if you have already watched the series, and are looking for something a long the lines of \"Girls' Last Tour\"  but with a little more action. You can check out \"Kino's Journey\" or you can check out \"Made In Abyss\" from this past 2017 season. Both of these series deal with exploration, but they also have a good bit of decent drama in them as well. \\n\\n",

I was taking in the atmosphere for the first few episodes and intrigued by the world and how it could have gotten that way. Of course GLT made it as slow and painful as possible to get any answers. The characters weredrier than stale bread and I honestly feel nothing after all those episodes. No joy, motivation or excitement at all. Most likely I am not the intended demographic as most slice of life anime make me yawn. \\n\\n\r\nThe art was passable and the music was above average which were the only things saving this show for me.\\n\\n\r\nRate 3/10.",

This anime is pretty sweet and very funny and combines elements of slice of lifewith sci-fi very well. The characters design is pretty cute and they are really likable. The art and animation was pretty well done throughout the series. I enjoy this anime a lot and it was really nice to watch. \\n\\n\r\nI recommend to watch this anime if you are into slice of life, sci-fi, comedy and love moe girls. \\n\\n\r\n( \u02ca\u1d55\u02cb )\u2661.\u00b0\u2445",

I'm sure if I were to read the manga I would probably appreciate it much more.\r\nI'm a very large fan of the chibi art style for most of the characters and the environment is very beautiful. I'm also a huge fun of WWII themes, which is what drew me into this anime in the first place. Thetwo main characters Yuu and Chito are very cute and had me caring about them the whole time.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for this anime is fantastic. I never skipped the OP (Ugoku, Uguko) but I cannot say the same for the ED. However, my favorite track from the soundtrack would have to be Amadare no Uta. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou and I will be recommending it to almost everyone I know. While being my first review, this is also the first anime that I have watched as it aired and it has been an amazing experience.  Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou has convinced me to look forward to watching airing anime in the future.",

            "content": "Note: I have not read the source material (manga), so this review will be based on the anime alone.\r\nGirls\u2019 last tour follows two girls, Chi and Yui as they wander around a post-apocalyptic wasteland scavenging for food, fuel, and pondering about life in general. Despite having a fantastic world setting, the actual story is presented in a more slice-of-life way, with each episode containing one or two short stories with a theme.\r\nThe fact that this vast, amazing world is so underutilized is such a pity. We see what appears to be a far-future city built in multiple layers, each layer with a rather distinct designand style. There are also numerous locations from factories to residentials to food production facilities the girls explore, but in the end they serve little more than as backdrops to the mundane life or occasional philosophical musings of the girls. There\u2019s certainly nothing wrong with creating a huge interesting world but not using it, it just strikes me that the stories completely pales compared to the world around it.\\n\\n\r\nIn typical iyashikei fashion, the world around the girls are perilous, but they\u2019re never in any real peril -- though the same can\u2019t be said of the people they meet. Many stories focus on the girls coming across some remnant of the old civilization, and imagine what life used to be like in hilarious but simple ways. \\n\\n\r\nThe art complements the mood and story well, but nothing extraordinary. There are some interesting use of 3D sprinkled in, especially when the girls are on their tracked motorcycle, and while noticeable, it's a far better implementation then some other talking motorcycle of the season.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is likewise relegated to providing a moody backdrop, and as such none of the tracks stand out in particular. The sole insert song (Amadare no Uta) was introduced in a very memorable fashion, however the extensive use of it afterwards (twice more in other episodes with minor variations) lessens the impact quite a bit, especially when the lyrics no longer matches the scene. The OP and ED are generic feeling Japanese pop songs, and does not serve any apparent purpose to improve the anime itself.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending sort of answers most of the most glaring questions, but isn't the most satisfying nor complete. I wouldn't know the 12th was the last episode if it weren't for MAL telling me. On the bright side, this leaves it open for more seasons?\\n\\n\r\nThe girls have some nice chemistry between them, and there are some interesting thoughts sprinkled within, but I don\u2019t recall an episode that struck me deeply or profoundly, so it\u2019ll have to settle for a mediocre score.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Story\r\nI don\u2019t think it is very fair to rate the story of this anime given the fact that there is not much of a story being told. This is a show about two girls trying to survive in a cold post-war world. It combines the struggles of survival with all the questions that may arise with it. \r\nArt \r\nThere is a very obvious contrast between the design of the characters and the scenery. While the characters have a very childish feel to them, the scenery is composed of several intriguing infrastructures painted in a dark pallette. \r\nThis might have been done on purpose to accentuatethe difference between the characters and the world they live in: two little girls in a gray world like two colored pencils mistakenly put in a box of coal pencils. Two children living in a world nobody should have to live in. \\n\r\nEven though the artstyle of the characters may be a little off putting, bear with it because it surprisingly works for what they are trying to portray in this anime. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nThe protagonists are two girls. There is a noticeable gap between their personalities which makes their interaction interesting. They are also portrayed in a realistic way, having doubts and questions that children would have in their situation. This makes their conversations natural and pleasant to follow.\\n\\n\r\nMusic\\n\r\nThere is not much to say regardless to this aspect. The soundtrack is nice but not outstanding in my opinion. Both opening and ending songs are enjoyable to listen to. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment + Overall \\n\r\nIt is not an anime for all tastes. It can be slow placed but that is greatly compensated by interesting and thought provoking dialogues. If you are looking for an anime that makes you think while having its silly moments, this is an anime worth checking out. Personally, I would go as far as to call it a hidden gem. \\n",

            "content": "The concept of \u201dfeel-good shows\u201d have never particularly interested me. A majority of them I\u2019ve watched or tried to watch have either been boring or lacked the ability to feel fulfilling in any meaningful way. Girls Last Tour is most definitely a feel-good show, so by my previous experiences with this kind of show I shouldn\u2019t be as in love with the show as I am, and in love with this show, I truly am. \r\nStory: 6 (Fine)\r\nThe story and plot of Girls Last Tour is arguably the shows weakest link. Just as with most slice of life shows, the plot takes a backseat tothe other aspects which I feel can hurt more than it can do any good. This is not quite the case here however. While the first couple of episodes have placed little to no emphasis on the plot, the show still keeps the viewer intrigued by setting up the world shrouded in mystery and only giving us very few pieces to the puzzle every episode. The mystery aspect of the world makes it easy for questions to form to the viewer since very little is actually revealed to us. What happened to the vast majority of humanity, when and why was the \u201cgreat war\u201d fought, why are cities built on huge platforms piled on top of each other and what about the rest of the world are just a handful of questions that I want answered. These questions remain in the back of the viewers heads while watching and keeps oneself interested enough in the show to come back week after week. \\n\\n\r\nBut I can\u2019t say that I trust the show a single bit. I simply can\u2019t help but to feel that this show is trying to make you smile as much as possible just to steal that smile away from you at the last moment. The strong sense of foreboding is a bit subtler than that of Gakkougurashi but I still get the same vibes from both shows. \\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: 8 (Great)\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s not much here to complain about. Overall the quality of the animation is solid. While the show doesn\u2019t feature any moments of sakuga, which is pretty usual for these feel-good shows, there is rarely any dip in said animation quality, except for the quite unexceptional CG scenes. The art style does a fantastic job of setting the melancholy mood and sense for foreboding I mentioned earlier. While it might seem dull and bleak at firs, I think it truly fits the theme and reflects the bleak setting of the world. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7 (Good)\\n\\n\r\nAs with the animation, I\u2019ve not got much to say about both the sound design and soundtrack except that they\u2019re both fairly good. The sound design is high quality and nothing has felt out of place, but nothing made me really pay any attention to it. I could say the same thing about the soundtrack. It manages to help the art set the tone, but never really stands on its own. The show does two things wonderfully though. First off, the voice acting is absolutely brilliant, and the emotion and feeling conveyed through the voices alone despite the language barrier is fantastic. The second thing is both the op and ed, both of which are so sugary sweet it\u2019s truly addictive. Especially the op, which I can watch on repeat for hours on end. Seriously. I CAN NOT overstate how much I love this intro.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8 (Great)\\n\\n\r\nNow this is what makes this show so damn loveable. Yuuri and Chito may just be the most loveable duo ever, obviously a hyperbaly but you get my drift. Watching these two rays of pure sunshine and happiness going through this ruined world, day by day, with no clear end in sight makes me crack a grin every single time. The way these girls still manage to have fun, laugh and live on fills me up with warmth and a feeling that when life seems worthless, friends will always be there to help you through it. While we still don\u2019t know much about these characters, that only enhances the intrigue and mystery of the world they inhabit, as revealing too much of their backstory could potentially give away too much about the world as well. \\n\\n\r\nThese two girls, Yuuri and Chito, play of off each other to great effect and their friendship seems more genuine than most real friendships I see on a day to day basis, and that is a part of what makes it so enjoyable to watch. Yu\u2019s lighthearted, goofy and almost careless demeanor fits so nicely with Chi\u2019s more down-to-earth, methodical personality. Because of this, the fact that the show only has two characters, with the exception of the odd side character, doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that it will get repetitive or dull.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8 (Great)\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, I\u2019ve enjoyed every single second of this so far, which is far more than what I expected. Few shows have had me smiling as much as Girls Last Tour has, but part of that enjoyment comes from the foreboding present in the shows atmosphere and lack of backstory which will remain in the back of my head until the show is over and I may or may not sleep soundly, depending of course of my suspicions about the show comes true or not. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7 (Good)\\n\\n\r\nThis is the first \u201cfeel-good\u201d show I\u2019ve watched that actually made me feel \u201cgood\u201d purely from the sweetness that is its characters. Most of what could be said here has already been said previously in the review. I love its characters and the tone of the show for what it\u2019s worth, but there are aspects of the show that simply hold it back in my book from actually being a great show. I wouldn\u2019t miss an episode for the world however, and I\u2019ll gladly recommend this show to anyone that is willing to listen.\\n",

Never preachy, rather exciting to see these two wonderful characters with perfect voice acting and interaction discover new things. Uplifting, beautiful, despairing, and melancholic all at the same time. Its worldbuilding is stunning for it is mysterious, intriguing, and discovered in tiny bits. Girls' Last Tour never fills in the answer for us entirely but rather allows the viewer to join these girls on their journey and fill in the blanks for ourselves. \r\nShoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou is one of the more powerful shows of its era, makingus go through all of the emotion spectrum with its optimistic take on existentialism within its mere 12 episodes run-time.

            "content": "I've always thought when it comes to our notions and philosophies about the world there are two aspects: what we can reason to be true and what we feel to be true. And whilst we may know the former to be the superior measure of these concepts, it's really the latter that solidifies these philosophies for us and can motivate us to act them out in the world. If you truly feel something to be the case, that's always ultimately more compelling than simply knowing it to be the case. It's why impassioned political rhetoric is a greater motivator than a tightly reasoned discourse ona political idea.\\n\\n\r\nGirls' Last Tour has not much to say. Its dialogue is sparse and uncomplicated and its soundscape is mostly reduced to the whir of the Kettenkrad's engine, the clanking of ancient gears, and the pitter patter of raindrops falling on a deserted city. Instead this is a show that is primarily concerned with making you feel its themes and its messages. It is less a story to be viewed and followed and more something to be experienced. \\n\\n\r\nIn many ways each episode functions as a loosely connected series of meditations on a collection of themes, progressing not with any precise structure, but more the stream of consciousness of a beat poet or free jazz musician. It is also happy to raise topics for contemplation without insisting on having every answer, acting more as a springboard for the viewer's own thoughts and feelings on the issue. That said, there are certainly some times where it wears its opinions on its khaki sleeve. \\n\\n\r\nSignificantly, the childish innocence of the characters and their ignorance of the world that was facilitates a back to basics approach with each theme it addresses - an approach straight out of Descartes. This serves to cast aside preconceived notions and accumulated, obfuscating complexity.\\n\\n\r\nIt is a richly atmospheric show, but the precise nature of the atmosphere is surprisingly multifaceted. By choosing to present its protagonists in moe blob form, a setting that might be unbearably depressing is given a shred of light. And despite its post-apocalyptic scenery and the constant sense that very bad things have happened in this place, it never gets bogged down in the bleakness it could easily have risked with less nuanced writing and direction. There are periods of profound melancholy, but never dread, horror, or despair. This is despite the horror by association of both the apocalyptic landscape and the WWII-era aesthetic of much of the show. And against its darker moments and the bleak industrial landscape the characters traverse, there are moments of profound, but simple beauty that revel in the simple pleasure of just being alive. Indeed, if anything, this show is ultimately uplifting despite the nihilism implied by - but never really dwelt on - of its setting and plot.\\n\\n\r\nWhat there is of its plot is decidedly slow-burn and much of it doesn't really gain particular substance until the final pair of episodes and particularly the finale. For those in search of action and excitement, this is not the show for you. That said there is always some sense of momentum and growth in the girls' journey. They and the viewer are constantly learning about and exploring more of their world. \\n\\n\r\nThe show's heart is obviously the relationship between Chi and Yuu, who act as perfect foils for each other. They are each deeply charming in their own way, and if they were less so it's impossible to see this show working. In broad sketches Yuu is the happy go-lucky one and Chi is the more contemplative, observant one. But as time goes on subtler nuances of their personalities gradually accumulate to form them more fully. Ultimately, in their differences can be seen that same dichotomy I mentioned in the opening - with Yuu being driven by raw feeling and Chi by reason. Ultimately they both have much to offer. In the world they live in pure reason could only lead to nihilism and despair. Pure feeling would lead to recklessness and death. But together the two approaches perfectly buttress each other. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack to this show, which only seldom intrudes, is stunning - one of the best I've heard in recent years. It captures the spirit of this show perfectly - melancholic beauty with a dash of hope. \\n\\n\r\nIf there is any overarching theme, it is probably on the futility of war. From the very beginning we see the wasteland that human arms have wrought, but we are also reminded through the girls' dialogue that no one now remembers why the war was fought, or who the different sides were. All we know is that almost no one survived, so nothing was really gained by any side. As with any theme this show addresses, it is through powerfully showing the futility of this conflict that we are made to feel the truth of that sentiment. \\n\\n\r\nThis is a beautiful piece of art that will linger with you long after you've finished with it. It's extremely slow pace will mean it's not for everyone, but I strongly advise everyone to at least give it a go.",

            "content": "The appeal for the Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou (SSR) manga was rooted in a deeply dark and realistic take on a world where humanity had all but disappeared. The vast constructions left behind served as a haunting reminder of the fragility of civilization and humanity as whole, seen through the eyes of protagonists that were just as out of their depth as the audience felt. The audience's view might even have appeared more foreboding, seeing the machines of industry and war with an understanding of their abilities and destructive capabilities. \r\n     The SSR manga was very bleak,vaguely sinister, and almost oppressively atmospheric in its trek through a dying world, a far cry from the similar post apocalyptic anime series of recent years. The translation of the story from manga form to anime form was one that could have followed that same presentation of ominous yet wordless storytelling, but instead developed into its own story, oddly due to the sound design.\\n\\n\r\n     The focus of the series on methodical traveling and dialog rather than action and quick movement or varied crowds means the simple animation is perfectly serviceable. It\u2019s not great by any measure, but remains consistent throughout most of the series. The animation also takes inspiration directly from the manga, which used the simplified art to increase the mystery of the world. The simplified art works well from a narrative perspective of the two main girls not being able to comprehend the entirety of the world around them, and as such see the world in a very simple light. Still, a greater amount of detail in the world would have been nice to flesh out the backdrops of the series. \\n\\n\r\n     There were slight animation hiccups during sequences where the the Kettenkrad (armored motorcycle) was shown moving from a distance. These sequences utilize some form of animation similar to CGI from the Fate series or the crowds from Re:Zero. The shift was a little disjointing, especially with how often the Kettenkrad is in use. Hand drawn or full CGI, consistent animation would have been ideal for such an integral part of the whole series.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of SSR doesn\u2019t follow one overarching plot, but rather follows multiple little stories. These stories usually come on a per-episode basis, but will occasionally reference situations from past episodes. As such, each episode tends to focus on one idea or another: meaning in life, music, phobias, war, and eating just for examples. It\u2019s an interesting reflection on what\u2019s important both before and after the fall of civilization. \\n\\n\r\n\tThe only connecting aspect of the whole series is the constant journey the pair of main characters embark on. The origin and ending of their journey are both are unknown, and not really of importance to the story. The journey is the destination as the saying goes.\\n\\n\r\n\tAlong that journey does not come a wide variety of characters. The main pair, the dark haired, cautious Chi, and the eternally hungry and free spirited Yuu might go entire episodes by themselves. Their dynamic of straight man and comedy works well to oppose the barren and bleak world surround them, but sometimes feels out of place given how positive the characters can be on occasion. Otherwise, Chii and Yuu have consistent interests and personalities, and while their actions might be predictable it\u2019s fine for exploring the themes of the series. It's also enjoyable to see just how each will react to the new situations they will encounter each episode, whether perilous or silly.\\n\\n\r\n     Sound design is an often overlooked aspect of digital media, but becomes very important for a series whose strengths lie in atmosphere, background storytelling, and establishing the tone of the series. The manga, of course, had only the background noise the reader would apply themselves, often inspired by vast landscapes and towering, abandoned, cities. As such, the inclusion of background music, an upbeat OP song, and a far lesser amount of atmospheric ambience gave the series a much lighter tone than its manga counterpart. Rather than it being the story of two people struggling through the crumbling remains of a city, its instead  became \u201ccute girls doing cute things\u201d in a semi-perilous post apocalyptic setting.\\n\\n\r\n     The sound design might even be a deal breaker for anyone expecting a darker and more serious tone. Manga readers especially might have preconceived ways that the world sounded. The difference in tone almost creates two different stories: one about a journey that two girls are taking, and one about the final moments of a dying land and the few people in it. This anime is definitely meant to be the former, for better or worse.\\n",

(from looking at other reviews, there doesn't seem to be any in between)\r\nGirls' Last Tour is in one word, dull. However in this case I don't believe that to be a bad thing. Our two main characters are travelling endlessly forward in a completely desolate and war-torn city, that's honestly about as dull as you can get and as a viewer you will feel that. In my opinion eliciting that feeling is what kept me investedin our main duo. I was able to empathize with how they were feeling and as such react similarly to how they did, when anything even remotely interesting happened. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is told in a sort of episodic format, with the forward march of our protagonists being the only overarching narrative. Each episode will have one or two little stories/themes which essentially boil down to food for thought. If you don't like sitting around contemplating ideas or rethinking points of view that you may have had, then this anime is not for you.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end I give this show a 9/10. The sound design along with the very grey color pallet, did a fantastic job in selling the atmosphere of an empty post apocalyptic world. The main thing holding me back from giving this a 10/10 is the ending (of which I won't say more) and the fact that I simply would like to have more episodes.\\n\\n\r\nPS: If you want more context for my scores out of 10, please visit my profile.",

Nothing super compelling going on, or interesting, its just a nice show to sit back and watch. Even the philosophy in it is nothing really enlightening, it just adds character. The story isn't really relevant, its just watching two girls go around in a post-apocalypse surviving. They are learning about each other along the way. Its hard to explain, its like a moth to light, you will be drawn to it for no other reason then it exists. I liked it because it wassimple. It is a break from the norm.",

Another part is the methodically slow pace that each episode is set to. Midway through the series, I found myself wondering what the point of it all was?\r\nAnd that\u2019s what makes this show so great and memorable. It\u2019s NOT ABOUT finding answers, but rather an exploration of how we deal with life\u2019s mysteries. The chibi art used for our main characters is really quite brilliant, as it conveys their innocence in this dystopian wasteland. Chi and Yuu(along with the viewers) are given just enough clues to propel them forward on their ambiguous path, but the answers are largely left to the imagination. What you take this show is directly tied to what you bring into it.\\n\\n\r\nAs Chi and Yuu journeyed through this post apocalyptic land, several influences were brought to mind. Imagine if Terrence Malick played Ico or Shadow of the Colossus, then decided to make an anime based on his inspiration? And don\u2019t forget what may be the best, most haunting, and loveliest music scores in years, anime or otherwise. That\u2019s Girls\u2019 Last Tour in a nutshell.",

            "content": "I'm not sure what I expected from a show about two girls with cutesy character designs traveling around in a massive abandoned city, foraging to survive.\r\nWhatever they were, I think it's safe to say Girl's Last Tour certainly takes the cake for subverting them.\r\nThis is definitely one I'd recommend if you're looking for a casual and (mostly) relaxing journey.\r\nThe mystery of the city is something that quickly drew me in - while the girls have to deal with life in it daily, they - and the audience - are left wondering how the city got into this state of decay.\r\nHuge industrial buildings, complex machines, andmassive amounts of weapons spread across it. It's safe to guess the general reason for its state - the girls are wearing military uniforms, after all.\\n\r\nBut throughout its sprawling size and many layers, traces of actual humans are all but non-existent.\\n\\n\r\nIn a way, I mainly felt progress in the story simply through learning more about the past.\\n\r\nDespite this, I still enjoyed the two girls' for their (albeit simple) characters and chemistry. Their interactions are surprisingly lighthearted for a couple of kids struggling daily to survive. \\n\r\nI think this tone is quite helpful in keeping doom and gloom out of an otherwise apocalyptic scenario, though this is also touched upon by scenes in which our protagonists find themselves in dangerous situations. \\n\\n\r\nAlongside the girls we learn more about the city and its past inhabitants. They explore traces of several past civilizations, usually only able to do little more than guess as to their cultures and daily lives. We also see them lightly explore philosophical ideas through their encounters with strange things and individuals.\\n\\n\r\nThe show climaxes at its closure, where a huge amount of the past is revealed to our characters, along with a lot of 'weirdness'. While I'd managed to piece together some prodded suggestions, seeing all the fragments that we'd been shown come together was very satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nTo wrap the whole experience up, Girl's Last Tour has a wonderful ambient soundtrack, providing lazy tunes suited to the (mostly) undramatic story.\\n\r\nAt times vocal melodies with a melancholic tone are used in scenes to pack an extra punch.\\n\r\nEvery time I noticed the music I thought it fit perfectly, adding a whole lot to this great experience.",

Maybe these people didn't want to think that, so they made all those statues and bright lights to put themselves at ease.\"\r\n\"At ease, huh... If anything. I felt way more at ease when I found you in the dark, Chii-chan.\"\r\nStory, Writing & Character: 10/10\r\nPicture a snow-laden wasteland, stretching as far as the eyes can see. Rain falls. The revving of engine stops. Two girls park their Kettenkrad motorcycle outside and take shelter under a pile of rubble. One reads. One collects a bunch of tin cans and putsthem under where the raindrops drip. \\n\r\nThe sound of rain is accompanied by a cacophony of metallic noises. \\n\\n\r\n\"Maybe this is what they call 'music'.\" \\n\\n\r\nA beat and rhythm starts to form. They hum and sing a tune to this beat. \\n\\n\r\nThey don't even know what music is. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAs you can tell, 70% of this show's story is told through its unbelievably thick atmosphere. Every time I sat down to watch an episode, I would enter into a trance-like state, where a flood of emotions would well up from within, submerging my higher brain functions like noodles in broth. These emotions are not intense, but mellow and tame. \\n\r\nShoujo Shuumatsu is in equal parts surreal as it is funny and cathartic. Chito and Yuuri just don't give a fuck. With childlike wonder and vigor they ride their motorbike across what remains of civilization, looking for their next meal and climbing to the top of the futuristic multi-layered city. \\n\\n\r\nBut.\\n\\n\r\nAs soon as you've settled into the show's mellow atmosphere, it nonchalantly slaps you across the face with some grade-A existential commentary on life, death, and how people can keep on living through the worst of times in the most destitute of places. The shadow of the Old World follows Chito and Yuuri everywhere they go in this post-apocalyptic world, and as the show goes on, they will discover that many things about the meaning of life, the human experience, and the bond they have with one another. Never do they wallow in melodrama or angst; they confront these dark themes in a very carefree way, only to then continue on their journey. After all, as Yuuri puts it:\\n\\n\r\n\"You can't live if you're afraid of death, Chii-chan.\"\\n\\n\r\nThe sound of rain, a fish, an old camera, and each other's company are a few among the many things that makes life in a cold and dead wasteland not so bad after all.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nMinimalist, and equal parts cute and lighthearted as it is haunting and beautiful; needless to say, the artstyle of Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryouko is extremely unique. The cute and cartoony design of the two girls starkly contrasts with the bleakness of the post-apocalyptic urban landscape around them, which ranges from derelict buildings to metal tunnels to crashed planes to former warzones littered with weapons and vehicles. The show's color palette also reflects this bleakness by having mostly very dull and dark colors for the backgrounds and buildings, while giving the girls a slightly brighter (but not by much) palette compared to their surroundings. All-in-all, interesting and ingenious art design. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is amazing. First off, both the OPs and the EDs are extremely unique and catchy. They capture the show's innocent and whimsical tone so well that it's baffling. The background music in the individual episodes is nothing to scoff at either - from calming piano and harp instrumentals to angelic vocal tracks. The entire show is jam packed with music from start to finish, making the entire show feel lively and energetic so as to mirror Chito and Yuuri's journey itself. \\n\\n\r\nAll-in-all, the soundtrack is amazing: sometimes melancholic; sometimes cathartic; but always maximally atmospheric and fitting.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nEvery single thing this show does hits all the right notes for me. I don't remember liking a show this much since I watched Re:Zero and Baccano a year or two ago.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sheer amount of text that I have written about Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryoukou in this review should tell you to how much I liked it. Beautiful, minimalistic, surreal, haunting and all-around sublime; Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryouko stimulates the senses in all the right ways, while still managing to be an unbelievably relaxing show.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nTldr? Just watch it lol.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Watch the first episode. It has one of the most memorable scenes I've ever seen in anime, and that one moment is enough for me to rate this show highly, and that scene is from a slow-paced, atmospheric, character-driven show.\r\nGirls' Last Tour (Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou) is full of these moments of innocence, hope, and the fragility of life. The character designs are adorable, the scenery is beautiful (if rusty), and the music and sound effects are soothing. These elements do well in distracting from how alone the two main girls are and how brittle those beautiful elements can really be.\r\nThe girls' lives are enjoyable towatch, but they are traveling to new areas and seeing new vistas because they are ultimately just searching for food. They are surviving. But when they laugh, joke, and marvel at whatever they find, it's hard not to cheer them on for them to live another day and experience more of their world's surreallity.\\n\\n\r\nTheir lives feel brittle, their destructed environments feel brittle, but you know what else feels brittle? The girls' friendship. They step over each other fairly often, and when they're the only ones around, it can be scary. There's a question of whether either of them will finally cross the line with their next antic, ending the relationship altogether, but it's okay. The girls are honest about themselves and each other. They don't get in the way of what the other wants to do, and they reconcile when things get out of hand. These moments that highlight the fragility of their friendship just makes that friendship more tangible and powerful, more so than other iyashikei (healing/soothing) anime, or other anime in general.\\n\\n\r\nGirls' Last Tour is also pretty philosophical, asking simple yet profound questions about life and humanity as they travel through war-torn cities, yet the show isn't pretentious about it. The questions come from a childlike curiosity, seeing the remains of a world that the girls never knew and wanting to know the most basic, fundamental reasons for why the world is the way it is. Their blissful ignorance of the desires and tragedies of humanity lead to some interesting and fun conclusions, finding a way to sound unesoteric without sounding any less profound.\\n\\n\r\nIn general, the show is at its highest when it strikes that delicate balance between hope and hopelessness, finding joys in both as the girls whimsically ride to their next destination. Even in its episodic nature, the show manages to have emotionally powerful moments throughout the season\u2014in between moments of pure, rhythmic bliss. \\n\\n\r\nIf there is any flaw, it would be the animation isn't noteworthy, particularly in CG segments with the girls' tank-like car. Most of the time, the world is empty anyway, and the girls 2D designs look like dolls so the CG still fits, but there are moments when better animation could have made some of the show's best moments even better, and the CG is a bit overused overall. It's enough to take me out of the experience slightly from a perfect score.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless, Girls' Last Tour is my favorite seasonal anime in a long time. In just about every sense, it was incredibly enjoyable, and I would love to dive back into the series with a second season or rewatch in the future.\\n\\n\r\nZetsubou~ Zetsubou~",

It surpirsed me.\r\nIt doesn't matter whether it's a place in a distant future or a previously unexplored location. Upon encountering something foreign, we expect (or hope) anime characters to express their curiosity, we expect some thought processes behind these discoveries. What does this gadget do? How did it get here?\r\nUnfortunately, most of the time, anime (of any genre really, but especially slice of life) tend to focus a lot on the characters. If it's comedy, the anime focuses on character interactionsand how it leads to comedy. If it's romance, it focuses on character interactions that lead to romance. You get what I mean.\\n\\n\r\nGirls' last Tour doesn't. The anime is literally what it means in the title. It's about two girls literally on a tour, travelling, observing and documenting as they go.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nThe show reminds me of Made in Abyss and Mushishi (or Kino's Journey) bunched up into one. As we follow the girls along their journey, we see through their eyes and follow their thoughts. Sometimes we see something familiar, but of course, the girls don't know about it. They still try to learn though. Along the way they meet several characters and help them. Thereafter the girls depart on their journey. Like Mushishi, the story is episodic and slow paced, but calm and relaxing. Like Made In Abyss, the anime draws viewers in as the viewers see the world through the girls' eyes, and stirs up a sense of curiosity. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nThe art was good but not particularly impressive. The character models were cute and suits the show very well, despite some darker moments.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nThe OP and ED were strong, and the sound effects were well-done. The rest of the OST, however, did not really stand out.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nThe characters were well-done for a slice of life-ish anime. At any point in time I was able to understand what each character is thinking or feeling and they did not seem one dimensional at all. Unfortunately, one problem I have is how no one ever thought of sticking together with whoever they meet in the dystopian world. After all, better chances of survival, right?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nNeedless to say this was a great show. Even though some parts of it weren't perfect, it still caught me by surprise. Still really good.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Most people would basically drop this flat out since it lacks any form of action which is basically what almost every others out there are wanting (in which mainstream anime mostly portray) but let's not talk about that..\r\nFirst of all, this anime is basically about the adventures of 2 cute girls in military uniform, going up the heights as they explore new areas and such (seems like the inverted form of The Abyss am I correct?) but it's not just that, if you focus (or rather not have second thoughts while watching it) you'll certainly be given a piece of truth (or an author's /character's view in the aspects life)\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with the Story.\\n\r\nMost of the time, they're just continuing on where they left off and answer each other's curiosity in life and view of what life is, but that's not all there is to it. It has a base in which they are still in track of, It may not be that clear but everything is connected. Mostly Insights and Thoughts while they're still living and finding a way to live in that wasteland.. hoping to know why or what started and will there ever be someone, somewhere or something they could go to.\\n\\n\r\nI was drawn to the final episode's story where they revealed the events that happened in the past that led to the destruction of basically everything in the world. To be honest, it even moved me to tears (for my own reasons, don't judge me based on that; cry on your own reasons too, don't act like me.)\\n\\n\r\nExpecting how a Slice-Of-Life will go on, The Main Story is just a backbone supporting everything else, it's as simple as that but they are creating multiple platforms (if you know what I'm talking about.. It's not focused on a kind of story you'd expect; since it's a slice-of-life and all, it's just right that there's no laid out pattern that's like a story of a hero saving someone or some kind of stories like that. The end doesn't even make a closure to something like \"and they lived happily ever after\" which is also just right for the genre of this anime. But rather, it's some kind of film where the battery just ran out.. and you'd just have the wanting to know what's happening next? so... will they or will they not? kind of idea)\\n\\n\r\nNext up is Art.\\n\r\nThey're not as greatly detailed as any other anime and the characters resemble the chibi-like style of Deep in Abyss (should probably stop mentioning that now) but the backgrounds have dept and give off a certain feel of adventure, loneliness and such accompanied with the Sounds and Dialogues. I'm one of those guys who like vast abandoned or unexplored lands being portrayed in an abstract or somewhat realistic manner (not just one of those normal forests and a clutter of buildings from the skycraper's viewing area; I mean, those unique ones) and that just achieves the level of satisfaction I wanted.. also + points for the cute characters.\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nYes, basically one of the bests this season. From background sounds (gunshots, falling metals, explosions) to Music; it just blends so well and that  some of them make an impact to the art's feel as well.\\n\r\nAlso credits for the amazing Opening and Ending music.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter.\\n\r\nYes, this comes at last, We have 2 kawaii girls that's been living and venturing this huge area of layers in search for a living civilization, food supply and such... Most frequently than ever that they talk about random stuff like Dreams, Life and Death, Houses and other kinds of stuff in their personal opinion. Also the fact that they encountered people and other kinds of object and things add to their perspective as well, building a way in which they keep on hoping and giving them much more space to talk about. They are so cute... the chibi-style is really nice. Also to say that those encounters give them motivation and other kinds of emotion and realization just supports the story in itself (which is basically just a backbone to the whole ; meaning that the story in itself is simply easy to explain but theoretically gives you some space to think and to want to know of)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment.\\n\r\nI basically enjoyed it from beginning to last. To be honest, I never had the \"Ehhh boring\" kinda expression to begin with ( I always had that on dramas that are really stressful ) It feels like an escape and relief from every other anime out there, it's just so peaceful and simple at best... The background accompanied with the Sounds give off a nice warm color (which they are also manipulating with to give off an impression) Makes me enjoy it even more. The story too, It's not one of those \"ah, I know what happens next already because it's so common\" kind of expression other anime are dealing with (slice-of-life anime are great at avoiding that; there's a lot less expectancy on a single matter) Can't forget the fact that I like every piece of detail in the surroundings, yes, I like it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall;\\n\r\nI'll definitely recommend this to you if you're finding an escape for action-packed thrills, drama and other stuff; It's rather simple yet elegant (can't seem to find the right words but in other stuff; it's kinda like a stress-relief although it made me cri) And what's best is that it's a Slice-Of-Life means not every action is predictable, gives you some kind of scenario to think of and leaves a wanting for another season. It's deeply filled with thoughts and answers that are around the aspects of life, civilization and other matters but keeps on with it's concept.\\n\\n\r\nSo I give it a 10/10.",

            "content": "Girls Last Tour features two young girls, Chito and Yuuri, whom slowly weld their way into your heart as you get to know them and follow them along on their journey. Despite how hopeless and desolate their situation is, they don't give up and continue forward, fighting to survive and hold onto hope that perhaps they'll discover something different up ahead. \r\nDespite the depressing premise, it's not a story that's overtly intense or action-packed. This is not the story for you if that's the expectation you have, or the type of media you crave. \r\n(Spoilers from here on out, yes you should watch it.) \r\nThisstory will make you reflect on things you've taken for granted. It will teach you that even in a situation as hopeless as the one Chito and Yuuri are in, that there's ways to find joy and hope in simple small things. Even Iishi and Kanazawa, who were more worn down by the hopelessness and isolation they experienced from being alone for so long, tried their best in their own ways to turn their situation into something less bleak. They gave themselves a purpose in order to continue onward. \\n\\n\r\nChito and Yuuri's relationship is very close and special. They may fight and bicker sometimes, but in the end they always laugh it off and continue onwards. As the story progresses, you find yourself loving their pure interactions and cheering for both of them. The following will be my personal opinion, but I believe there was more to Chito and Yuuri's relationship than just friendship. Especially that final scene in the last episode where:\\n\\n\r\nThey held hands and stared at each other in a very intimate way for way too long as they confessed that, as long as they had each other nothing else would matter. Not even the world ending. \\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion that scene was definitely queer-coded, and no one will convince me otherwise. \\n\\n\r\nBesides the characters, my favorite part was the overall music and soundtrack. I found myself bopping to the opening and dancing along with the girls at the start. Whenever the soundtrack played during the episode, I'd feel the emotions of the track along with whatever was happening with the scene. I would get strong feelings of dread, sadness, or joy depending. It was very powerful and one of the strong suits of the anime for certain. \\n\\n\r\nThe art style on the other hand was relatively simple and suited the whole premise/idea that the anime stood for. The backgrounds were plain for the most part, which again suited the cutesty moe-blob in a post-apocalyptic world. The animation wasn't that great, as a lot of the time the characters or background was stagnant. There would be times where the animation was janky as it skipped to bad CGI of Chito or Yuuri and then back to regular animation again. This usually happened as they were riding their Kettenkrad. Despite this, it wasn't enough to ruin the whole experience for me and I was able to continue on with a mild annoyance when it did occur. \\n\\n\r\nI close off my review of Girls Last Tour with a sense of sadness. These girls had become special to me in a way I did not expect. They are still continuing onward in their journey to the top, and eventually the moon itself. But we have a confirmation by the strange AI they encountered that the world is for certain ending, and that they're the only ones left. I find myself wanting to know about these girls, their past, and the world around them, the AI, everything it has to offer, as well as their ending and the climax to their relationship before the true worlds end. It's an intriguing story, and definitely worth a watch.",

It's nothing creative either because everything looks like something out of the modern world or older. The show switches quite often between 2D and 3D and it's not very good at doing it because you can tell straight away with the rigid character models.\r\nThe show doesn't actually mention anything about why the place isdesserted but there is a short scene that shows they were in the middle of a war at some point. Despite the setting it's a very laid-back, relaxed kind of show for the most part. You have your cute characters doing silly things as they wander so the mood brightens up every so often. I think this the only time when you can't associate long faces with sadness. Even though they're supposed to be struggling to survive and never know when someone they meet will be the enemy there's just no sense of desperation at all. No real dangers lurk, just two girls casually joking around as they travel. It's kind of uneventful for the most part to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not laugh-out-loud funny either, just the odd silliness here and there that keeps the show entertaining. It kind of makes you look at your own quality of life as you watch the girls discover the little comforts of daily life that we take for granted such as just the basic needs food and shelter. It's nice to see even when times are supposedly desperate the girls still consider their morales before taking any action. Every episode has one or more themes and before you know it, an episode is over.\\n\\n\r\nIt might make you look at the world around you in a new light.",

            "content": "This show shouldn't even work as a concept for an anime, but it does anyway.\r\nSo what is this show about? It's a show about these two girls doing what they can to survive so they can live to see tomorrow. We begin in a seemingly deserted city that has been war torn and now left to be neglected as there are hardly any humans left to keep everything from falling apart and everything is in ruin.\r\nOur two main characters of the show, Chito and Yuuri, travel around the now mostly deserted city that was once a thriving metropolis full of life and people. But aterrible war happened that created the post-apocalyptic environment as Chito and Yuuri know it. Nothing much really happens in the show. They mostly spend their time just traveling around the ruined city while talking and speculating about how things were in the past. But that is the beauty of this show since it leaves it up to the viewer of how and why things are the way they are in this show as we see Chito and Yuuri try to find a silver lining in a world that has grown dark.\\n\\n\r\nWhat probably makes this show special is seeing how humanity can be at its best but also at its worst as well. In a way this show reminds me of another anime I've seen before that's called Legend of the Galactic Heroes which is a space opera about a war between an authoritarian dictatorship and a free democracy in the bitter struggle to determine humanity's fate. So why am I bringing up Legend of the Galactic Heroes? Because that show also does a pretty good job showing the brutality of war and what happens when corrupt and incompetent people in power that do not care about the well being of their own people do what they can just so they can fuel their egos and self-gratification. While Girls' Last Tour doesn't go that much into detail about what happened before the ruin, the show does give plenty of clues of why everything is the way they are and this is the end result of what happens when those in power don't listen to reason and eventually everything is destroyed and everyone loses.\\n\\n\r\nNow this show can be seen as boring and dull since nothing much happens aside from two girls exploring a ruined city and talking but I do think people should give this show a chance because it's one of those gems that you don't see too often and shouldn't be passed up. Overall this is a great show and I consider it to be one of the best works of anime that I've seen so there you have it.\\n\\n\r\n\"Zu jeder Zeit, an jedem Ort, bleibt das Tun der Menschen das gleiche.\" (\"In every age, in every place, the deeds of men remain the same.\")\ufeff",

What I mean by that, the tones, the art, the music, and the character all hit for me really well. While I wasn't excessively moved by each piece, and while I didn't feel emotional at all points in this series, they definitely were able to tell their story in a coherent and interesting way.\r\nI would say the closest I came to emotion is in one of the final episodes where they debate machine consciousness and life. However, Ioften found myself enthralled with the background and \"mini-stories\" that this world had to offer. Whether it was a story from the past or a story from the present, the struggle of the few remaining people to find meaning in their lives is something deeply and easily related to. All humans struggle with this sense and desire for meaning every day in their lives, even those who find the idea of life \"meaningless\".\\n\\n\r\nGirls Last Tour may win some anime awards, but ultimately I don't think it's a landmark. However for sheer art and characterization (supplemented by both a good OP and ED), I think it should definitely be on your watchlist.",

I checked the first episode out of curiosity, fully expecting to drop it afterward with my curiosity satisfied. I was not expecting an experience that not only competes in Kino's mindspace, but in my opinion exceeds it.\r\nI've had the hardest time trying to explain why I like this show so much. If I were writing an English paper about it, I'd be using the word \"juxtaposition\" a lot. The theme is deadly serious - survival in a post-apocalyptic world - but thetone is that of almost playful curiosity. The characters look goofy and blobular, but the scenery is breathtakingly gorgeous and detailed. The world is mostly familiar to us, the viewers, but it's dotted throughout with strange and mysterious things that give this city its own unique identity. Even the two main characters are basically opposites and play off each other really well. Then I'd vaguely mumble about how these juxtapositions reflect the inherent duality of life, even in the darkest of circumstances and so on.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, this is a gut-feel show more than anything I can try to be objective about. Fortunately, the first episode is a perfect reflection of the tone and theme of the series throughout. Every story arc, you're going to see Chi and Yuu exploring or discovering some thing or idea that you're probably familiar with (darkness, war, power plants, fish, religion, etc.), and from that you can get an interesting new perspective on that familiar thing or idea. Every story arc also contributes to building this unusual post-apocalyptic world - usually either highlighting one of the quirks that sets it apart from our world, or hinting at the nature of the apocalypse.",

The innocence of the protagonists.\\n\\n\r\nThe cool script of Shoujo Shuumatsu is that he does not get stuck in just telling the story of the protagonists and their discoveries until they reach the top of the post-war city.\\n\r\nThe all-time script makes it clear that the proposal is much more complex than it really is. When we talk about natural selection of species, it is always a taboo, evolution of the environment and its cycles, use of technologies to change this environment between the evolution of humanity. These are all subjects covered in Shoujo Shuuumatsu, in the view of two girls.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this anime.",

            "content": "Something about this fits perfectly within me. Just like BLAME! it's mostly about exploring a desolate world, although this is not as dark for the most part. This is a classic I would say. It was created in a time where you don't see anime like this at all very often. The sound is surprisingly good, the music is nice, and the anime does well with being funny or cute while having a dark and desolate background. It leaves you starving to know more about what the world was like before everything went to shit. The last episode wraps it up very well, and isone of my favourite episodes in an anime ever. The dark and desolate world this takes place in is devoid of any life, and although you feel the loneliness, the two protagonists give the needed human element into the story. Don't expect action or romance, this is a quiet anime the puts more attention on the journey than the reasons or the destination.",

            "content": "PLOT: Everyday is a learning experience (especially when it involves an aftermath of a war). Two young girls Chito & Yuuri are exploring all over the country to see the remains. Each episode contains full of wonder, possibilities & curiosity too. Even though it is episodic... it feels right to have it in the series.\r\nCHARACTERS:\r\nChito: Responsible, kind, caring, usually seen driving their vehicle & loves to learn something new.\r\nYuuri: carefree, loving, funny marksman. She loves food & is always asking questions to Chito about various topics.\r\nOVERALL:\r\nThis is one of the most interesting & profoundly beautiful animes to watch in 2017! The art style is different& is similar to Made in Abyss. Each episode contains a new lesson for the girls to learn (& the titles just basically proves it all). I suggest you guys watch this anime until the very end!! Episode 12 can mostly answer the questions that has all of us wondering since episode 1!",

            "content": "Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou aka Girls Last Tour has finished airing. By all means it was one of not if the best thing to come out of this Fall 2017 anime season. This show is about 2 girls, Chito and Yuuri, who go around their post apocalyptic world looking for food and supplies. They only have each other. In the show they find artifacts of the old world, they realize and appreciating things that were common place before the, what I assume, war. Its a very gruesome existence for these two girls live in, although, it is a cutesy anime to remedy this. The art styleand design of the girls are very cute. It makes you enjoy watching them go though this hopeless world, as messed up as that might sound. I cannot describe the amount of love I feel for these characters. The entire show in general makes me feel good on the inside. The music also helps with this, somewhat hopeless, but also ok with it, existence. Everything about this show is lovely. I rate this show a 10 out of 10. Anyone who wants a feel good anime should watch this. This has been your spoiler free but not really review on Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou aka Girls Last Tour.",
