            "content": "For centuries, it has been man's dream to fly.  Because of the Wright Brothers, we finally have the technology to do so, and as such, have been able to soar into the skies, give or take the method.  But we have never truly been able to fly by ourselves.  But here, we have Aokana, an anime about flying, and the sport that goes along with it known as Flying Circus.\r\nStory:  In the world of Aokana, the world has developed special footwear called Grav-shoes, a kind of footwear that allows for the user to utilize anti-graviton particles in order to essentially defygravity and fly.  In order to make the idea of Grav-shoes more fun, a new sport known as Flying Circus was developed, creating a brand new activity that one could do with their new shoes.  It is here where we meet Kurashina Asuka, a bright and optimistic girl who dreams of soaring in the skies.\\n\\n\r\nAt its core, Aokana is centered around Asuka and her journey through the sport of Flying Circus, or FC for short.  The show is centered around her and her group of friends in the FC club at her high school, participating in competitions and aiming to become top FC players.  So more or less, this is your standard tournament/sports anime that focuses around beating stronger opponents and progressively getting better and better as time goes on, right?  Well...no, actually.  \\n\\n\r\nContrary to what the show looks like from the outside, Aokana has a surprisingly deep set of values that it showcases.  It really hammers in what it takes to be good at a sport, and the satisfaction of winning when facing someone tough.  In fact, the characters are shown to more or less only be fighting the same opponents, completely disregarding a 'stronger challenger approaches' style of story.  The anime shows us the true feeling of losing and how heartbreaking it can be, as well as the beauty and satisfaction of winning, all things that you wouldn't see in your generic tournament anime where the protagonist just barrels his/her way through each match without trying and winning every time because he/she is that good.  There's genuine feeling when it comes to seeing the growth of these characters and it really made me like this show and want to continue watching.  The progression is far better than what I had expected it to be, and I was happy to receive such a surprise.\\n\\n\r\nOn the downside though, the show has some issues with some of its presentation.  Some aspects of the show feel cliched and everything is tied up with a nice ribbon bow, so the plot is predictable in that regard.  Additionally, the show does have quite a lot of moe-affiliated moments where the show does tell you once again \"Hey, we're a show with a bunch of cute girls doing some cute stuff\", which it is.  It takes away from the serious atmosphere a little bit, but for me, it really wasn't really a problem.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, while there were problems and issues with its presentation, Aokana had a message that was far deeper than I thought it would ever have given what it looked like on the outside.  The show had good progression and a good mix of good to bad moments that helped improve character growth and, despite its appearance of one guy surrounded by several girls, IS NOT A HAREM!  (I know, shocking right?  We can have an anime with that kind of character setup WITHOUT having romance!  Gasp!)\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Interesting story concept  (The sport is simple, but surprisingly complex.)\\n\r\n+  Great message and themes throughout\\n\r\n+  Not a harem despite what we get for a cast\\n\r\n-   Has cliched and/or predictable moments that do take some credibility of the show away\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:  The cast of Aokana isn't particularly big.  As mentioned before, the show more or less focuses on a relatively small group of characters where they all fight amongst each other in the sport.  There're no \"Challenger-kuns\" anywhere once the rivals have been established, and the show takes its time to develop its cast.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, we have our spunky and optimistic main protagonist, Kurashina Asuka.  Asuka is the very definition of optimism.  Her dream is to soar high in the sky, and most of her lines involve things being \"amazing\" and being \"spectacular\" to the point that it's actually somewhat annoying.  A somehow gifted natural at FC, Asuka is sort of that 'prodigy' kind of character who gets stuff or is able to do complicated stuff relatively easy in the series, even to the extent that even towards the end, she is able to handle more difficult maneuvers or strategies that would ordinarily taken someone else weeks or even months to accomplish.  As a character, she is more of a catalyst for things, as she evokes feelings and aids in the character development for others, without really changing much herself.  She does have bouts of sadness and some time dedicated to her recovery after a loss, but she's the type to get back up on her feet quickly, so there's really no worry there.\\n\\n\r\nThe people that are interesting are both Mashiro and Misaki, the two other members of the FC club that Asuka belong to.  As a senpai loving kouhai and a nyanko respectively, Mashiro and Misaki are more of the characters that project and showcase the quality of what it is to have ups and downs in a sport, as each of them have dedicated time to their characters.  These areas of the anime are sections where I think both the message and the anime really shine, because they're both very realistic examples of what it means to participate and try to get really into a sport since both of their mini character arcs are dedicated to resolving their own insecurities and strengthening the qualities that they possess and turning it into in the series' words, \"Their own FC\", aka, their own style of playing.  \\n\\n\r\nIf I was to make a complaint, it would have to be geared towards Masaya Hinata, our male character guy.  Masaya is a character who really...doesn't have all that much importance in this series.  As Aokana was originally a VN before getting adapted, Masaya is the player character and is dictated by the actions of the player.  In the anime, Masaya more or less plays a supporting role to the series, which is fine since I'm all for a series with 1 guy and a bunch of girls that isn't a harem series, but they try to give an explanation and time to his backstory and why he decided 'never to fly again' which just ends up being incomplete and very lackluster.  It is by far the weakest aspect of the characters by far, which is surprising since the side characters not only get more screentime, but more development than our so-called male protagonist here.\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters are definitely a side cast that has more worth to this series than most anime I've seen.  Other FC players like Shindou, Inui, and Rika get little moments dedicated to them to add onto the message that the show coaxes in, and Madoka, who is more or less the comedic straight man to everyone (poor Madoka).  Point being, there are members of this side cast that deserve mention, and only add to this show since a good number of them actually develop along with the series, if only for a little bit of character development.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Great character development\\n\r\n+ Good focus on main females and their development\\n\r\n+ Side cast members also get development\\n\r\n-  Asuka is a bit too perfect sometimes and gets a bit annoying\\n\r\n-  Masaya, the supposed main character, is basically nonexistent to this series\\n\\n\r\nArt:  Produced by Gonzo, Aokana boasts a very high quality and whimsical looking style for Aokana.  All of the colors have this shimmering bright sheen to them that reflects the sunny and bright feeling that the show evokes, creating this wonderfully colorful show that looks very pleasing to look at.  The characters also look very nice in conjunction with the background and move very fluidly in terms of the normal animation fluidity.  The artstyle is heavily moe-centered, as the characters, girls in particularly, are drawn in a very cutesy style coupled with some cutely exaggerated moments at a shot at comedy and cute pictures.  I say this because there are people that REALLY hate moe, so I just wanted to mention it here.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that the show has is effects, and lots of them.  The grav-shoes create contrails when the fly, and the effects of those are just really stunning to look at.  One thing that does bug me about the anime is the fact that they utilize 3-D CGI very often when they're trying to make a flying scene.  Using CGI for stuff like this is understandable, since the characters are moving very fast, and the amount of frame per second in order to create something like that would be time consuming to say the least, but the CGI is done in a way that really looks obvious, especially due to the fact that the fluidity of that particular scene looks stranger than it normally is.  (Also, there really isn't much fanservice to be had.  We get like...1 bath scene or so, and that's about it in the way of fanservice.)\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Really nice artwork\\n\r\n+  Great effects\\n\r\n-   CGI wasn't meshed well and stood out easily\\n\\n\r\nSound: The OST for Aokana is very fitting for the series.  The entire OST is more or less performed with airy instruments like the flute, in order to keep up with the theme of flying up and whatnot.  The OP \"Contrails\" is a very vibrant and uplifting piece that fits with the positive, soaring feeling that the characters have when they sprout their wings and lift off.  It's a very happy song that while doesn't have a staggeringly large amount of memorable factor to it, it's still a good song.\\n\\n\r\nThe ED on the other hand is a more toned down song that has a similar soaring feeling to it.  But instead of soaring high, the song more or less drifts around and glides.  It's not particularly a song that I feel lacks in comparison to its OP.  It's not a bad song, but its calm and generic sound really doesn't really do the song any favors for being particularly memorable.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Good, fitting music\\n\r\n-   Not really a memorable OST\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment:  Aokana was that one show this season that out of every show in my watching list I thought would turn out to be a surprisingly good show, a dark horse that was good, but no one would watch.  And now, after finishing it, turns out, I was right.  It has its flaws and its problems, but honestly?  I really think that this was a good show; an unexpectedly good show.  \\n\\n\r\nDid I like this anime?\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, I really did.  I liked it far more than I thought I would.  It's unassumingly cute exterior hides a really deep and meaningful set of themes that was not only well tackled, but really played into why I think that this anime deserves far more attention than it gets.  Hell, the OP has the phrase \"True Battle comes After Losing\", and that could not be more true to what happens in this show, and in real life.  Also, flying shoes.  Science, get on it.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this anime?\\n\\n\r\nOk, I'll be honest, Asuka is a bit irritating.  Her constant optimism is a feature of the anime that really doesn't fall, which really isn't a good thing.  She sees the bright side of practically everything and doesn't falter which in a sense, clashes with what this show was trying to convey.  In addition, Masaya was just NOT used.  He had so much potential, and could've really added a lot to the series, but in the end, he was more or less shoved to the side and wasn't really as important as he could've or should've been.  (And yes, I know that Asuka IS the main character here.  Doesn't mean we couldn't have devoted more focus to Masaya.)\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime?\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I think that this anime is definitely worth a watch.  While it looks all cutesy and moe on the outside (which...it honestly does do a lot, quite a bit actually...), what the show tries to tell us with its themes gives the show far more worth than your seasonal generic moe show.  It tells us that enjoying the things we like doing is more important than winning or losing, and that work has to be put into something in order to get better, and it conveys these messages so well!  IMO, Aokana is an underrated show from Winter 2016, and despite its flaws, is still worth a watch.",

            "content": "It took me far longer to get this review out than I had originally planned. But alas, it's here!\r\nAoKana was a series that I was extremely hyped up for, without a doubt more than anything from the Winter 2016 season. Why? Delving a bit into the past, I read three routes of the visual novel back in June of 2015, all of which were self-translated using my knowledge of katakana/hiragana and a dictionary. It took a very long time, however I thought it was well worth it in the end simply because of how much I enjoyed it. Well more than enough to throw itin as one of my top 3 visual novels of all time, which is a pretty large thing for me to say given that I've read quite a few of them in my life.\\n\\n\r\nAoKana was a series to have its anime adaptation announced before the visual novel had even come out, which was about a year and a half prior to the anime's first episode original air date. Was I a bit skeptical by this, given that it likely means that the anime's only goal will be to advertise a brand new visual novel and not as much to be a good anime? Of course I was. However, what made me believe that this anime would be hard to screw up was just how much adaptation potential the visual novel had.\\n\\n\r\nNow, what do I mean by that last statement? Basically, I felt that the visual novel would've fit far better within the medium of anime than it would in its visual novel form. In a way, I thought potential was being wasted by it being a visual novel, despite how good of a visual novel it was. So, to me, it would be extremely hard to screw up this adaptation, even if the studio in charge is one with as lousy of a history as Gonzo. That is, as long as it isn't rushed... which, sadly, the announcement of it only being 12 episodes long made me believe that it would end up pretty rushed.\\n\\n\r\nSince you can, obviously, see my score of the series, you probably already know what I'm going to say about it, however let's still get on with the review.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nI don't want to say the story of AoKana is cliche, because it really isn't. It deals with sci-fi themes involving humans being able to fly, and a sport that's never existed outside of the universe of AoKana. However, the way these themes are dealt with is a bit cliche/genetic, in a way.\\n\\n\r\nMeet our main character, Masaya Hinata. He has decided to quit the game that this anime is based on, Flying Circus (FC), forever. That is, until he meets a girl named Asuka Kurashina, who has always dreamed of flying in the sky. When she learns about FC from Masaya, she decides that she wants to play more than anything, and also asks Masaya to be her coach. Masaya eventually agrees to be her coach, which means he must continue to make FC a significant part of his life, despite no longer wanting to be a part of it.\\n\\n\r\nDo you understand how I say this is cliche in its own way? Despite the fact that it deals with completely fresh concepts, such as humans being able to fly and a sport that has never existed outside of this universe, the entire grabber of the series is still just a chain of cliche, generic, overused events that have happened far too many times in anime. Guy never wants to play a certain thing ever again for what we can likely assume is because of a past event, but suddenly a cute girl is so interested in it and wants him to help her through it, so he decides to abandon his own morals and help her. Sounds kind of familiar, doesn't it?\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's really all AoKana is for the first 4 or so episodes. The entire situation and the events that happen have been used far too many times to consider anything but generic. However, it's when you're able to slog through those first 4 episodes that you realize how good this series truly is. But first, sadly, I need to talk about what makes those first 4 episodes as bad as they are.\\n\\n\r\n1. Everything's been used a million times.\\n\r\nAs I said above, the first 4 episodes are really generic. As Asuka wants to start playing in this new sport, she joins her school's sports team, and is met with other cute girls that basically surround Masaya the entire time. It's then that we learn that the uniforms used to play FC are really tight and slightly skimpy outfits that bring out the T&A of these girls. Then, a string of really cliche things happen, such as the girls having sleepovers or being caught in awkward situations, going to the mall together to get Asuka the FC gear she needs to play, and fanservice. LOTS of fanservice.\\n\\n\r\n2. The pacing and quality is terrible.\\n\r\nAs I originally predicted, the first 4 episodes of AoKana are definitely rushed. Things go by way too fast to really consider them \"remarkable\" in even the slightest way, and you're given almost no time to savor the events that happen. The ONLY time that the pacing slows down is when you WANT it to be rushed; during massive fanservice scenes, like bath scenes and the like.\\n\r\nAs for the quality, there are TONS of DBZ-style continuous three-frame animation sequences that are used to cut down budget while still making it look like things are happening. Again, this only changes during scenes of fanservice. Things like that are good for boosting sales of the source material.\\n\\n\r\n3. It's BOOOOOOOOORING.\\n\r\nIt honestly DOES feel like not a whole lot is happening throughout these first 4 episodes, despite that being the exact opposite. What do I mean by that? When you finish the first 4 episodes, you will think back and only really remember the character introductions and what's happened to develop them thus far. The story progression won't feel like much has happened, but that's far from the truth. This is where we go back to it being extremely rushed. It's so rushed that far too many things are cut out that shouldn't be, and thus it feels like nothing has happened when in reality, quite a bit has happened. Like, lots. This was a major flaw that I feared when it was announced that AoKana would only be 12 episodes.\\n\\n\r\n4. Character progression\\n\r\nOverwhelming character progression doesn't really sound like it'd be a bad thing to most people when first hearing about it, but in the first 4 episodes of AoKana, it KINDA is. While I, personally, didn't think it was all that bad, many other people did. By as early as episode 2, there were people out there who were already getting sick of Asuka's character, which really shouldn't have been the case so early on. Her character was one that was meant to be adored quite a bit. This was a slight problem for Mashiro as well, but I didn't really hear a lot of complaints regarding her, so I supposed all is well there.\\n\\n\r\nAlright, so I know what you're thinking so far. \"Why the hell did you give this an 8/10? This sounds like a piece of crap so far!\" Honestly, that was my goal here. To make the series sound like total crap up to this point. Because, in all honesty, that's really what it was up until episode 5. It sucked. To the point where I ended up dropping it until about a month after it had finished airing, despite how anticipated I was to watch it originally.\\n\\n\r\nThen, we get to what I like to call the \"meat and potatoes\" of the series... the good part, the part that was right on-par with the rest of the visual novel, and that was just as I had expected from an anime adaptation of this wonderful visual novel: something that I could even say was BETTER than the source material.\\n\r\nI probably wouldn't go as far as to actually say that, but at the very least, both were equally as good from this point on.\\n\\n\r\nEPISODES 5-12:\\n\r\nIt's almost instantly notable how much better the pacing is in episodes 5 and 6. You're able to savor almost everything that happens. Also, the quality of the show looks and feels much better; very little fanservice happens beyond reason, the art looks much more fluid, and there aren't really any situations where three-frame animation would take center stage and lower the quality of anything else. It all looks done well, and it made me happy how much better it was than the first 4 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe story begins to actually take off in episode 7, where we learn a lot of things that are crucial to the rest of the series, as well as crucial to some things that happened in past episodes. Mainly, the past of some characters, as well as within the psyche of another dominant character.\\n\\n\r\nI think episodes 8-12 were without a doubt some of the best episodes I've ever seen in anime, or at the very least, some that I enjoyed the very most. What I really dislike about reviewing is that I can't go into depth with that without spoiling, but at the very least, listen to my words. The storytelling is incredibly well-done, the characters are delved into deeper and deeper outside of just continuous progression like in the first 4 episodes, and things start to matter a lot more. You start to become more and more attached to the characters/story of this series, maybe even more than you ever imagined you could, given how badly the first 4 episodes were done.\\n\\n\r\nI also want to give my props to the director. Sometimes, poor directing can lead to a series being far worse than it really is, despite how good the story/characters may be. The directing of AoKana was top-notch, done perfectly for what it's worth. And I also LOVED that Wings of Courage was used in episode 12. Thank you for that. That made my entire day.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall, the story of AoKana goes like this:\\n\r\nEpisodes 1-4 = no\\n\r\nEpisodes 5-7 = yes\\n\r\nEpisodes 8-12 = HELL YES\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of AoKana are some of my very favorite to ever come from a visual novel. This wasn't really changed very much in the anime adaptation, aside from the first 2-3 episodes. The personalities of all the characters were kept almost exactly the same, and were only skewered a bit in the beginning but were quickly put back on track.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, Asuka was my favorite. I do agree that she was depicted to be far more annoying and clingy than she actually is in the first 2 episodes, and the constant \"COACHY!!\" that flew out of her mouth every 5 seconds did become obnoxious after a while. But, as I implied above, this was a very short-last thing. Even during episodes 3 and 4, which I also thought were very lousy and unworthy of being a part of this series, I still thought Asuka's character was great and depicted well for what we were given.\\n\\n\r\nBesides Asuka, there was no character I liked a great deal, but that doesn't change the fact that they were still depicted very well in accordance to the series as a whole. Were those other characters perfect? Obviously not, or else I would've loved all of them! Nah, but they were still far greater than typical generic harem bait characters that you'd usually see in a series like this.\\n\\n\r\nIf I haven't mentioned already, there's NO romance in this series whatsoever. It's almost entirely based on the FC sport, which is a breath of fresh air given that any other series that was composed like this, especially one based off of a visual novel, would end up just being a huge harem where every girl wants to get with the dude. That isn't the case here in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nI really thought the characters here were done exceptionally, and almost perfect in a way. Asuka is without a doubt one of my favorite characters of all time, and none of the other characters had enough flaws to consider anything LESS than very good. Overall, almost flawless, just simply fantastic characters.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound:\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that key visuals/concept art of the anime made me realize, was just how similar the character designs were to the visual novel. That's a pretty rare thing, as visual novels typically look much better given that still images are used instead of actual animation. Minus Grisaia no Kajitsu and its sequels/prequels, VERY few visual novel adaptations have art that looks even half as good as it did in the visual novel.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some distinctive differences between the art styles of the two, with the most apparent one being the color choices. However, those are very simple to get used to, and you will get used to them very quickly. If you're someone coming into this anime without any prior reading of the visual novel, you will love the art from the get-go and that will be that.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound, however, was nothing special at all. While I did love the opening, the insert of Wings of Courage in episode 12, and thought the ending was pretty great as well, that was really the only exceptional pieces of the entire soundtrack. The rest of it complemented the anime pretty well, and I have no complaints overall. But nothing stood out enough to be considered that great.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said, however, I still have no complaints. It was still a good soundtrack, and I'll rate it as such.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal verdict:\\n\\n\r\nAoKana is a bit of a hidden gem. It is certainly not perfect, and really is nothing amazing besides the very last few episodes. However, it is still well worth the watch simply because of how fresh it is and how enjoyable it is. The cliche start to the series ends up taking a great new face by turning into something that's enjoyable beyond even some of the greatest anime out there. Everything changes after those first 4 episodes, and it becomes something almost impossible to dislike. AoKana is, without a doubt, good enough to consider the 2nd best series by studio Gonzo thus far, behind only Welcome to the NHK.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 8, it had its flaws in the beginning but the last 8 episodes are, for the most part, flawless in doing what they try to do. Delves much deeper than you'd ever expect in the later parts of the series.\\n\r\nCharacter - 9, every character did exactly what they were meant to, and Asuka did much more than that by being just simply amazing.\\n\r\nArt - 9, almost identical to the amazing art of the visual novel.\\n\r\nSound - 7, good soundtrack but nothing stood out aside from a few external things.\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9, there are few series out there that I enjoy more than this one. No kidding.\\n\\n\r\nOverall score for AoKana: Four Rhythm Across the Blue: 8/10.\\n\r\nA great series through and through, but nothing too amazing. It had its flaws early on but once it corrected them, it was pretty freaking incredible.\\n\\n\r\nWho would I recommend this series to:\\n\r\nIf you like sports anime, you'll surely like this one.\\n\r\nIf you're sick of the same cliches that happen in sports anime and want a fresh experience, you'll surely like this anime as it is an incredibly fresh take on the sports sub-genre.\\n\r\nIf you've never watched a sports anime before, this is surely a good place to start.\\n\\n\r\nOtherwise, if you want an enjoyable anime with good characters and fantastic art, you should consider checking out AoKana. Just remember, get through the first 4 episodes with understanding that it gets MUCH better after that. Don't think the entire series is going to be as bad as those first 4 episodes, because I can assure you that's NOT the case at all.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review! See you guys next time.\\n\\n\r\n- Alne <3",

It fused with it vey well especially when they are in a dog fight! The voice actress and actor had a nice voice. It's very clear.The sound of the sea breeze and the wind is quite spot on when putting on earphones which is quite good.\r\nDesign and graphics:\r\nA lot of kawai school girls with their newly designedoutfit for competition and it's quite catchy XD.Graphics are impressive of the waves and the character's expression of how serious they are during competition so there's nothing wrong with it.\\n\\n\r\nAt first it's gonna be not so bored since it's the introduction. Then, everything went fired up. Starts to get exciting, mind blown like WOW!!\\n\\n\r\nAll I want to say that is Go and watch it!",

(EDIT - Not anymore, thanks XEELTom for giving me the heads up! :) )\r\nQuick summary - in a world where people have flying shoes there exists a sport that's called Flying Circus. Basically you touch four poles as fast as you can or you whack the opponent's back or well, you prevent the opponent from doing so. Not really much of a premise there LOL.\r\nThis was pretty much a sleeper hit, it was a really outstanding show from start to end considering it was based off a VN. Instead, they dropped the romance and madeit all about the sport and the girls, which was a very good approach. Character development was surprisingly well done.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, if you are looking for a light hearted sport anime, this should fill that palate of yours.\\n\\n",

            "content": "The anime for people who are passionate about flying and sports. The anime, which has a great main concept/story line, but tries to strive for a little bit too much.\r\n|Objective Review|\r\n|Story/Plot|\r\nThe anime starts out well, sets up the scene well for the characters and the sci-fi sport called \"Flying Circus\". The story progresses at a good pace, making it easy to keep up, yet keeping it interesting enough. However, as the series go on, the anime tries to reach too high. As a result, there will be a lot of plot lines that are not properly developed or finished. For example, the anime sets upHinata as one of the main characters with his trauma, but instead pushes him into the background into a supporting role. The supposedly romance story line is also left there hanging. There are a couple of signs of it, but it just never really happens or even starts to develop. Overall, it just seems like the main sports/tournament story line is very well put together, meanwhile all the other ones were ignored and unfinished in the end.\\n\r\nPlot Score - 6 \\n\\n\r\n|Sports|\\n\r\nAs this anime is focused all around Flying Circus, it's quite important to see what the anime can bring to the sports lovers. The fantasy sports at it's core is fairly simple, but it still has plenty of depth. There are a fair amount of moves/tricks you can utilize, though it would have been nice to see more. As for strategies goes, it's a little bit lacking. It mostly just deciding whether to race or battle. In the end Inui does show some actual strategy, but it still feels a bit lacking. The rules also have some holes, like why not just skip to the third buoy instead of stopping to intercept. But all in all, the sports is fairly easy to pick up, not to mention it's a very flashy sports meaning it's good to watch. It just lacks a little bit of depth.\\n\r\nSports Score - 7\\n\\n\r\n|Sci-fi|\\n\r\nEven though in the beginning we don't know too much about the Grav-Shoes, in the latter part of the series we learn a lot more about them. It really gives more options for the anime to expand the sports. One of the reasons why the sports aspect of the anime doesn't become too boring at the end.\\n\\n\r\n|Characters|\\n\r\nThe characters are mostly cute and nice, but nothing particularly outstanding. The drama part of the anime is nothing too serious, it's just mostly rivalry which is used nicely to develop the characters and their relationships. It's a nice touch that they use multiple forms of rivalries for different couples, there are couples where it's just a friendly/mutual connection where others might be more tense. However, the way they set up Hinata and Kagami, it only seemed right to see them a little bit more (especially Hinata with his trauma). This, unfortunately, is almost completely forgotten and it's almost like the creators totally forgot about their existence.\\n\r\nCharacter Score - 8(for the MCs) - 4(for the rest) - 5 overall\\n\\n\r\n|Art|\\n\r\nThe art is just spectacular. The drawing is clear and the shading is very fine and soft. The overall style also complements the anime with it's bright happy ambiance. The animation throughout the series is pretty consistent and the effects smooth in with the rest of the animation greatly.\\n\r\nArt Score - 9\\n\\n\r\n|Sound|\\n\r\nThe sounds are also quite outstanding. While the voice acting and music is fairly good, it's the sound effects that really made this anime/sport enjoyable to watch. They are clear, crisp and really do give off a feeling of speed.\\n\r\nSound Score - 8\\n\\n\r\n|The whole package|\\n\r\nAs a whole, the Flying Circus is a very easy to watch sport with spectacular audio-visual experience. The sport mechanics itself are nothing too special, but they do the job. If you want to just relax and watch some fantasy sports, then this is for you. Just make sure you don't expect nothing else other than a good tournament \"documentary\". If you expect to see good comedy, romance, support characters, drama then you will probably get disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, if i had to put it into words, the anime has a great core, but the shell surrounding it is very fragile and has holes in it. For what it's supposed to be, it does the job very well, but it strives for more and then just flops.\\n\r\nOverall Score - 6.5(if you look at what it's supposed to be then 7.5)\\n\\n\\n\r\n|Subjective review| (SPOILER alert)\\n\r\nMy relationship with this anime was like a love&hate relationship. While i enjoyed the tournament, i wanted to see Hinata and Kagami fly and compete so bad. And when they teased it at the end of episode 10 i was so hyped. And then they just skipped it... We only saw both of them fly for like 10 seconds in the whole series. I felt for Misaki (couldn't care less for Asuka)\\n\r\nand was kinda disappointed by how they finished her story line. But yes, wasn't so bad but i definitely was frustrated with quite some parts personally.",

And these people can surely zip around. Even tho it does take a second to get rolling into the main action. I found myself enjoying it. Give it a chance and itmight grow on you.

            "content": "This series is rated lower than it deserves partly because many have judged the anime too quickly and dropped it since. Also, due to this, there are many lowly rated reviews for this anime. However, I'll be delivering my take on this anime.\r\nAo no Kanata no Four Rhythm - The REAL Proper Review \r\nAo no Kanata no Four Rhythm is an anime that could have had the potential to be a really great anime but was plagued by its origin. \"Eroge\" & \"Visual Novel\" Lets take a deeper look why it meets its demise when compared other animes of the season.\r\nMost anime are adapted &serialized from its manga counterpart. Manga are usually known & recognized for its deep plot/content. Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythm on the other hand is adapted from its visual novel known for its eroge. Most visual novels serving its \"eroge\" purposes have little to no real plot by default. Furthermore, its \"sports\" focus further reduce its chances for any deep plot to come by.\\n\\n\r\nHowever with Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythm, I think they have done pretty well despite being a \"sports\" anime. It's actually deeper than it seems and gets better at later episodes. \\n\\n\\n\r\nStory - 7/10 \\n\\n\r\nAo no Kanata no Four Rhythm revolves around a sports called \"Flying Circus\" The goal of the sports, by flying through the use of Grav shoes, is to score points by touching its buoys in sequence \"1,2,3,4\" or scoring a hit on the opponent's back. Or so it seems... This is when the real plot begins to surface. \\n\\n\r\nDo not JUDGE its plot before Episode 7, because that's where it really showed how deep it really is.\\n\\n\r\nWhen you love & know something so well, for example in a game, (In this case, FC) then all of a sudden, someone new just came & destroyed your concept of that. You become afraid, because the very thing you are so familiar & close to, becomes something you no longer understand. \\n\\n\r\nThat's what Misaki felt. FC became something \"dark\".\\n\\n\r\nAll these while, FC to her, was about touching buoy or hitting each other's back. A simple and fun sport. But Inui broke that concept. Instead of playing the game, she intensely pressures the opponent by restricting & denying whatever her opponent tries to do. It becomes a mental sports and makes you feel inferior & powerless. That's the \"beauty\" Inui and Saki sought. However, Asuka, being that carefree girl, may not fully understand the \"dark\" Misaki began to see. To Asuka, it is an exciting new territory of the game. But Misaki became afraid of FC, became afraid of Asuka. She could not accept how Asuka could think that way.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nBrilliant & Radiant. This anime is just beautiful to look at. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9/10 \\n\\n\r\nOne of the best anime's OST I've heard in a while. If you actually listen closely, you will notice. One example I can give is in Episode 6. \\n\\n\r\nListen closely to the OST:\\n\r\n05:04 to 06:02. \\n\r\n16:22 to 17:47.\\n\r\n17:47 to 19:45.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI love the contrast between Asuka and Misaki's mindset. As I've explained earlier. \\n\\n\r\nMasaya Hinata is your secretive hidden ace badass. He is shown to be rather highly intelligent.\\n\r\nAsuka Kurashina is your slightly clueless clumsy cute female MC with innate potential in FC that she doesn't really know about.\\n\r\nMisaki Tobisawai is strong female character that is also smart. Realizing the \"dark\" in FC.\\n\r\nMashiro Arisaka is your kawaii little loli with cute obsession with Misaki.\\n\r\nAoi Kagami is your ultimate hidden ace triumph card that you hope she would just come out and whoop everyone's ass. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI really like all the characters. There's a good variety in personalities and good comedy. I like seeing Asuka's sillyness, Mashiro's cute obsession with Misaki. Hinata & Kagami being the hidden badass retired aces.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8/10 \\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I really enjoyed this anime despite being poorly received by the community. A good mix of comedy, action with its beautiful art, amazing OSTs. Would definitely recommend to give this series a try and watch till the very end.",

It was very fast paced and many plotholes or even many important part, that would have make the story more exciting weren't animated. You dont get the feeling of something interesting and watch it merely because you somehow enjoy it how awesome it looks how theyfly and how the principle of \"their\" flying is. \\n\\n\r\nThe music was fine, nothing special or from heaven door, but atleast you can say that this was enough to make it an enjoyable anime. \\n\\n\r\nYou have too many characters to develop, yet only 12 episodes to animate. It's sad, since it could have been one of the top 150 contenders with a rating with 8~, but the budget was not enough. One the fatal weakpoints from becoming an actual good anime, since it lacks real development plus the  very fast pacing. \\n\\n\r\nIn the End, it is an enjoyable anime and you can watch it with a smile in your face. But dont expect too much from it and do not try to find logical aspects in it. It already stops with \"people flying and having a competition in it\". \\n\\n\r\n7/10",

So, she took up the so called sport and the plot pretty much revolves around how she got through all adversities to be an amazing FC player. Extra factors like having a coach who used to be one of the best players but quit due to personal reasons, becoming friends with the Best player of FC and more just adds up the entertaining factor to this anime.\r\nThis anime gives a very upbeatvibe, vibrant colours and great sound.\\n\r\nTo put it simply, it has a simple plot but the visuals and sound make up for the most of it, which makes it pretty much a decent anime for 2016.\\n\\n\r\nExtras: There's no romance at all for this anime.

            "content": "I\u2019m not going to waste your time and get to the point. This show is terrible. It gets worse as it goes along and there is nothing here that makes it worth your time. 0/5 and the only reason it\u2019s scored as a 1/5 is because I can\u2019t put a 0/5! There\u2019s nothing redeemable about it, but for clarification\u2019s sake, I\u2019ll explain. Also, no spoiler warning because this show is so bad that you\u2019ll be glad I spoiled it for you.\r\nA little bit of background on the show: it\u2019s an erotic visual novel, but adapted as something that has ALMOST no fanservice. Remember my phrasing,ALMOST, because it has a big effect on the show. Let\u2019s get into the juicy stuff now.\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\r\nBoring, uninspired, predictable. Nothing about this show is refreshing. The premise is boring, the setting is uninspired (school setting), and the plot progression is all over the place. Now, none of these would matter if executed correctly, but they aren\u2019t. The story takes 3 episodes to get started, and another 3 episodes for it to become watchable. It\u2019s essentially a sports anime, but with a sport that they made up. The plot is so predictable that when I predicted where the show would go AT EPISODE 1, it went that exact route. This is the definition of clich\u00e9! \\n\r\nA lot of scenes feel like filler with nothing worthwhile happening and is very skippable. It has a slice of life feel, except there is a plot that the show doesn\u2019t like to focus on. When a show doesn\u2019t focus on its own plot, why should the audience? \\n\r\nFanservice in this show is laughable. This show comes off as a kids show, but as I said, it comes from an erotic visual novel. The only reason some fanservice is left in here is because the creators wanted to get some extra Blu-ray sales. \\n\r\nThe setting of the show is at school. You may think that since flying is a huge aspect of the show, skirts would be a very illogical choice of clothing. Except that the girls wear skirts to school, which makes no sense whatsoever. Guys looking up their skirt would be guaranteed and happens in the anime. Furthermore, the design of the costumes for \u201ccompetitions\u201d are dumb. In a competition about speed, why would you wear baggy clothing? It\u2019d slow you down. Something like spandex would make the most sense because it\u2019s aerodynamic. Also, while in school, characters do moronic things that would otherwise get them expelled from school in real life!\\n\r\nThere will be info dumps. A lot of them. Every time something new is shown, you get info dumped on. Everything from \u201chow the shoes work\u201d to \u201chow to fly\u201d. Terrible writing, cheap dialogue, cringy jokes and characters, all bad. The main character has the special power of being amazing instantly and this is never explained. \\n\r\nThis seems to be a theme throughout the show. Not showing how things happened. They just expect you to know why something that happens is bad. One of the main conflicts is caused through unrealistic actions and it physically hurts me because of all the questions it brings up.\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\r\nCharacters are even more clich\u00e9 than the story. They all don\u2019t develop and follow the generic route of their archetypes. One of the characters quits, then rejoins through some terrible speech and they somehow win some competition through the power of friendship and cringy dialogue or whatever. They all only have one characteristic that defines them and could be replaced by just about any bland character and no one would be able to tell the difference.\\n\r\nCharacter interactions are unrealistic and uninspired. They don\u2019t feel like they would ever really happen and what characters say is more forced than terrible puns that people try to make. The main character\u2019s dialogue and voice actor make me stiffen up because of how the dialogue is said. The VA has a squeaky, annoying voice and says \u201cDESU\u201d all the time! It\u2019s annoying and breaks immersion. \\n\r\nThe other characters include: the one with the inferiority complex, the one that\u2019s obsessed with another character, the obligatory teacher, and the supposedly elusive character. You\u2019ll find out who\u2019s who by the end of episode one. The one with the inferiority complex is the one that quits and will rejoin because the plot needs them to.\\n\r\nWithin two episodes, characters have a better relationship than I do with people I\u2019ve known for 3 years, which would never happen. Interactions that would hurt these relationships have no effect like when the main male character gets to see the main female character naked TWICE because sales, stupidity on the characters part, and plot convenience. \\n\r\nIt\u2019s absurd that this much trash gets pushed through to a general audience each season. Anything else I say would be rambling and I feel like I\u2019ve asserted my points and explained them well. \\n\r\nSOUND\\n\r\nThis is the super subjective part because everyone\u2019s tastes in the sound department differs more than any other department. Like I said, I have the voice actors. They ruin the immersion of the show because of how annoying their voices are. They are all squeaky and over the top. They only help to reinforce the terrible dialogue by making it worse.\\n\r\nThe music is goes from forgettable to ear wrenchingly annoying. Sometimes I have to turn off all sound because I think it\u2019s so bad. The OP and ED don\u2019t bring someone into this show\u2019s world and seem lazy. There\u2019s literally nothing else to say.\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\r\nThis department is despicable. From moe to way too noticeable 3d cgi, this show uses all the worst art styles in the book. It takes skill to make animation look bad in this day and age, but this show did it without skipping a beat. \\n\r\nThe character\u2019s eyes keep moving on their faces as they talk, showing the inconsistencies with the animation. Their eyes are also always either too far apart or too close together. The 3d cg is noticeable for the \u201ccompetition\u201d scenes as they are used to save budget on animation and it still couldn\u2019t make the normal animation look good. The show switches back and forth because it shows the characters in 2d while they talk and in 3d while they are flying in these \u201ccompetitions\u201d. My final piece of evidence as to why this show is terrible!\\n\r\nFINAL VERDICT\\n\r\nAs I said in the beginning, the show is a 0/5. There\u2019s nothing good about it and going to sleep early would be more productive than wasting 3-4 hours watching this. If you want a GOOD sports anime, watch Baby Steps. Although it also has a low animation budget, it doesn\u2019t shoehorn in 3d cg for the main characters during their competition scenes and the important scenes are animated exceptionally well. That\u2019s all I have to say. Don\u2019t support this garbage and I hope you don\u2019t give this a rating above a 2/5!\\n",

            "content": "This is my first review on Internet so I hope I write this well.\r\nAo no Kanata no Four Rhythm is a awesome piece of work made by sprite and ruined by those who animated it. Only the people who actually played this godly game can understand this frustration.\r\nThe Story is about Asuka, a girl who moved to Kunashima due to her father's transfer and later comes across a sports called \"Flying Circus\" which uses GraShuu (A type of shoes which uses anti-graviton particle to make you fly) and then joins the \"Kunahama FC Club\" together with a classmate and a kouhai.\r\nStory 6/10. The Story presentedin the anime is completely different from how it really is. Getting from beginning, It was just Masaya alone who finds Asuka searching for her house keys. Also, it was him alone who uses the co-op system of the shoes to help Asuka get to the school on time. The terminal which is shown outside the school, is actually inside the building. (So if someone uses the Grashuu then he/she doesn't have to go all the way to cross the main gate). Misaki actually meets Asuka for the first time in the classroom. Masaya never knew that Mashiro family runs the Udon Shop untill Mashiro injures herself during the practice. It was Masaya alone Aoi-sensei asks to be the instructor for her flying lessons. Also It was just Masaya and Asuka who finds Satouin-san and Shion-senpai having an argument over the \"in\" letter plus Masaya actually doesn't see Asuka do the \"Air Kick Turn\" for the first time, as he closes his eyes not able to see her figure falling into the sea after the fail attempt to target Satouin -san's back, also it was Satoiun-san herself who explain about FC to Asuka. After the match Buchou bugs Masaya for like a week or so to join the club, and in the end, getting asked by sensei and convinced by asuka he finally decides to join the club. Also it was not Madoka but Masaya who takes the three of them to the Shirase-san's FC Shop. Though the story of the \"Anime Adaptation\" deserves 2, I gave it 6 just because it takes few points, just a few points from the original series.\\n\\n\r\nArt 6/10 - As expected of the art of these days anime's. It's well made. I have nothing to say about that.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10 - As the \"anime adaptation\" mixed few BGM from the VN, it's quite good to the ears. Plus the OP/ED are made quite well as well (Not as good as the VN's though)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6/10 - Aside Masaya, how they portrayed the characters in the anime are pretty much how they're like in the VN.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 2/10 - Just after watching the first two episodes of the anime, I raised the white flag, as I didn't wanted the headache I got from those two episodes to effect the surroundings.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 4/10 - I do know that the visual novel and light novels adaptations are pretty much like that and I don't wanna see the rest of the 10 episodes to prove that. \\n\r\nA piece of advice, if you know how to read Japanese then please play the game, I ensure you that it's 500 times better than the anime, but if you don't know how to read, then just wait for the English Translation to finish and then try it.",

            "content": ">> My review may contain a few spoilers, you're being warnedarcs/episodes would have been appreciated for me, but I don't have the right to blame too much about it since it's based on a visual novel and as such, have to be faithful to it in the different adaptations. \\n\r\nApart from that, the male protagonist, Masaya, is a retired FC pro player, coaching his friends of Kunahama high, after the latter were captivated from witnessing the FC sport. The realism of how this story progresses by excluding luck and unreal miracles, makes it different from what I used to watch in other sports themed anime.\\n\r\nIn spite of that, it's a pity that the show doesn't show FC at a wider scale.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe scenery, background and images are quite colourful, filled with light colours (mostly at least). The liveliness and attractiveness of the anime's sport is clearly underlined by the coloured trails left by the Grav-Shoes as well. You can say it's a kind of art which is manifesting under diverse forms, depending on someone's style, on top of being a sport. In a way, this aestheticism kind of mesmerize you (it does for me at least).\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe anime has a pretty relaxing, light opening, the same goes for the soundtrack, with some trying to underline the more intense atmosphere of major, skilled matches. Maybe, it's too soft and not enough pumped up, but who would want to disrupt the good and calm breeze anyway? It has its own and exotic wind enveloping and welcoming us.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, 13 episodes seem a bit short to show a certain, detailed development within the characters, but after fully watching it, that is not really the case. Each one of them has an inspiration to chase after, a good reason enough to light up a flame within them to boost them (Kazunari Shindo, Inui Saki...). Other than that, they make the anime fun and great to watch.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI truly liked watching the anime, too bad it is ephemeral because of a few episodes (sadly). A sequel would be quite neat, if it can remain all of the aspects of this one (or improve the plot's scale).\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nIt is a short but nonetheless great anime to watch, with a mixing between a thaw and tense soundtracks in their respective moments, as well as mesmerizing graphics/images at some point.",

            "content": "What a wonderful anime, just like the majority I sometimes doubted about the capacity of this, but it ended up being a incredible anime, I don't really know why people disliked this anime, perhaps the cuteness that they try to use is unpleasant, but I see no problem in it, the only thing that I have to complain is that when I first saw this anime until the end, it was a romance anime, which is absolutely not, no romance aspects, some days after the anime was finished it was modified, but yeah, now everything is correct, they also addedthe drama anime, can't really see many drama aspects and when it comes to be dramatic it's not a good drama.\\n\r\n     Story(9/10): The story is about a girl named Kurashina Asuka, she moved to an island that is know for having a tecnhology that can make people fly with, the Grav-Shoes, just like the name says they are shoes wich allow the wearer to fly, a simple flight mechanism that people in the island use to get around, after some events Asuka is introduced to the Flying Circus, a sport practiced with the Grav-Shoes wich consists in making points by touching flying buoys before your opponent or by touching his back, Asuka got impressed by this sport and end up practicing it with her new friends.\\n\\n\r\n     Art(8/10): The art is made to be cute, the anime tries to be a cute one, what does not fit well the anime, it is noticeable by looking at the girls cheek, always red and her voices, etc. However, the flying scenes are beautiful, there are some scenes especifically at the final game of the anime, that the art and animation are astonishing.\\n\\n\r\n     Sound:(9/10): I believe this is a really good point in this anime, I loved almost all the songs in it, the OP is great, the ED is beautiful, the songs at the last episode, that I believe are from the VN were awesome, also the soundtracks of the series is pretty good, I have nothing to complain about.\\n\\n\r\n     Character(8/10): The characters are not good, they could have been much better, there is little character development, it really could have more of it, that is the biggest problem about them, they're not bad characters, they have good personalities but some annoying parts about them too, if I have to say I think the characters are the worst part of the anime.\\n\\n\r\n     Enjoyment(9/10): Watching the flying scenes, watching how the characters get along, and how they get closer, I enjoyed a lot, the events of the anime probably won't let you get bored, it's beautiful to see the championship and seeing people flying, if it ever comes true I bet it will be a incredible feeling, to fly and to watch someone fly.\\n\\n\r\n     Overall(9/10): I think there is nothing bad on this anime, the characters are the worst part, but they are not bad, they are interesting in their own way, there's nothing that made me want to drop it so I don't know why people dropped and why it is so underrated, it is a great anime indeed.",

They get to compete against various FC players from different schools.\r\nCharacters 8/10:  Asuka is a newcomer to the school and the sport. She is also considered to be an underdog in the anime. Masaya is team's coach and understands the rules of FC. Mashiro is a young, talented player in FC and really loves Misaki. Misaki is an experienced player in FC. She is not a morning person and loves Udon!Madoka is the manager of the team. She is also caring and younger sister of Shion. Shion is captain of the team, and in his senior year. He is very passionate and experienced FC player, and is brother of Madoka. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10: I wish Flying Circus became an official sport (especially for the Olympics)! Personally, this is not like any other sport animes you would typically see. The anime has a great animation and sound. I really enjoy watching the opening; it gives an insight to what the viewers can expect. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 8.5/10: This anime is one of my favourites. It is definitely the one you should watch. Seeing the characters taking on the sport inspires and motivates you to try it as well. It can also motivate the viewers (especially the ones involved in sports) to never give up and to keep on trying. You can relate to the characters for the hardships they have endured and the lessons they have learned in the anime. I hope there is a season 2 in the future.",

            "content": "This was an anime that anyone who watched the first 2 episodes would have expected to be bad. I, for example, did not have high hopes. My girlfriend and I decided to watch it weekly as she was very excited about it and after the second episode, I wanted stop. At that point there was nothing overtly impressive about the show other than maybe the art, of which I felt at the time was wasted on a story like this. I whined to her about how the artistic world(island) it took place in looked so stunning, and it was wasted on this random anime. IfI were to have rated this anime after the first two episodes, I probably would of given it a 4.\\n\\n\r\nBut, having finished the whole thing(to meet my special other's demands), I have to say, I have no regrets. I can even go back to the first two episodes and enjoy them now. This anime is genuinely good, it won't seem it at first, but once the story picks up, you'll be pleasantly surprised. The concept is actually very interesting and unique, the art is fantastic, and the story, while a little predictable, is very compelling. If you are out of \"MUST WATCH\" animes at the moment, I fullheartedly recommend this one.",

            "content": "In an alternate world anti-gravity shoes are commonplace worldwide that allows the user to fly around in the sky practically. Thus came the creation of a game called \u2018Flying Circus\u2019 Asuka Kurashina is a transfer student who has no idea about anti-gravity shoes. After being introduced to the anti-gravity shoes and the sport \u2018Flying Circus\u2019 by Hinata Masaya and Misaki Tobisawa, Asuka then decides to join the \u2018Flying Circus\u2019 club bringing about its revival. \r\nNow I\u2019ll be the first to admit it, I didn\u2019t think this anime was going to go anywhere and the subject of flying was going to be a small plot pointwhilst the series focusses on the romance aspects and such. Boy\u2026 was I wrong. \\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: \\n\r\nThe story focusses on our main heroine Asuka Kurashina and her progression in the Flying circus team and we have the inclusion of other characters from Kunahama academy and their progression within the sport. \\n\\n\r\nInitially the show starts off in what I perceived to be a stereotypical romance/harem anime. Asuka meets Hinata on the beach and helps her out. The anime however decides not to take the romantic route and focusses entirely on the sports aspect of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nStory progression was steady throughout the show and I only feel that the rushed ending was the let-down for me. However what surprised me was that the show made me feel that some romantic elements were going to be included, but shifted focus away from what was in the visual novel, which in my opinion was a fantastic call. \\n\\n\r\nRomance elements can distract the story of an anime unless that is the central theme. However being a sports anime the focus was entirely on the development of their skills and the determination of the characters to fight for the sport that they love. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\r\nAsuka Kurashina is a ditsy and adorable girl who had aspirations of soaring through the skies as a child. When introduced to grav-shoes, Asuka initially struggles to use them and with the assistance of Hinata and Misaki, Asuka learns how to fly properly and after being persuaded to join the flying circus club Asuka\u2019s skills in flying and as an all-rounder player excel greatly. Asuka\u2019s relationships with other members in the group is solid and especially with Misaki which I will delve into. \\n\\n\r\nMisaki Tobisawa is a stern and energetic girl who is personally my favourite character in the show. It was after introducing Asuka to flying circus that Misaki would try competing in the sport again. I felt Misaki\u2019s development as a character was really tested after being beaten Kazunari Shind\u014d. I really loved how the show goes about portraying the change in desire after losing to someone else and witnessing someone else better than you. \\n\\n\r\nThe last mentionable character is Hinata Masaya who is the coach of the flying circus team. Hinata acts as a mentor for Asuka and the others to help improve their game. Masaya is a lesser character in the anime in comparison to being the main protagonist of the visual novel.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\r\nStudio Gonzo does yet again a great job of animating this series, the use of 3D was apparent in some episodes, but I didn\u2019t find it particularly distracting. Colours were vibrant, but character designs were nothing special if I\u2019m honest. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nThe sound was very good for the series. I haven\u2019t listened to the OST yet, but particularly during the flying circus matches It was heavy with excitement and anticipation. The sound tracks did a good job to get me invested in the intense sports battles. \"A-gain\" by Ray was an excellent ending song for the anime and accompanied by the visuals of Asuka and Misaki highlighting the two\u2019s close friendship and rivalry made it very enjoyable. \\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict:\\n\r\nI was quite sure this anime would end up being another stereotypical adaptation of a romance visual novel and I was honestly quite surprised with the final product. Let\u2019s get this straight Aokana is a sports anime, something I didn\u2019t realize since old reliable Wikipedia branded It as a romance. When stripped away of its romantic elements you do have yourself an enjoyable show to watch. That doesn\u2019t however mean it\u2019s a justifiable show to recommend. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime started off quite slow actually. I also felt that there are a lot of other sports anime out there that could do equally as much justice as Aokana did, but just a difference in sports. I can see how the appeal of flying through the skies can make can the show an attractive proposition and to integrate a sport into this was a very good idea, to which I give the Reiko Yoshida applause. \\n\\n\r\nThe silly moments provided comedic relief weren\u2019t anything too amusing and at times Misaki\u2019s use of cat speech like \u2018Nya\u2019 can be annoying, though I'm just nit-picking the little things.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall I found this Aokana to be a very nice show about competitive flying sports. I recommend this to fans of sports anime looking for alternative sports to basketball or tennis.  Those looking for romance elements won\u2019t find any here, so scoot along. \\n\\n\r\nI give Aokana a 7 out of 10 and a recommendation of trying the first four episodes. If you don\u2019t like it then move on to something else after that. \\n\\n\r\nAlternative recommendations for this are Ro-Kyu-Bu! A basketball anime with cutesy girls who aim to become better basketball players\u2026 Yeah... Sorry guys I don\u2019t watch a lot of sports anime can\u2019t find much else to compare this to if im honest. \\n\\n\r\nLastly I suggest trying a visual novel called. \u2018If my heart had wings\u2019 vastly different in terms of story as a group of highschoolers set out building a glider to soar through the open skies. It came to mind when i watched Aokana. If you like visual novels check it out. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading guys. Have a nice day!\\n",

            "content": "Ao No Kanata No Four Rhythm was adapted from a VN so before the show aired, most people (including me) all assumed that there would be romance in this show. Turns out Studio Gonzo decided to go the different path by choosing the slice-of-life path. This caused some -- if not -- most people to dislike the show but not me. I thought this was an average relaxing slice-of-life show and that's it. \r\n[Story]: (7/10)\r\nIn a world where flying is as simple as riding a bicycle, Four Rhythm Across the Blue is set in a world where people can take to the skies by usinga technology called \"Grav-shoes\" which allows the wearer to fly to the skies.  Aside from simple transportation, people also use these shoes in a competition called FC (Flying Circus). To score points, they either touch buoys floating above the ocean, or their opponent's backs. \\n\\n\r\nI was really hyped for this series when I first heard about it back in October of last year. I was like \"Flying Circus?, Drama and Romance?! Hell yeah, I'm watching this series\". It was my most anticipated series of Winter 2016. Fast forward to January when the show started airing, my hype slowly died down after the 3rd or so episode. What slowly killed the hype for me? Lack of romance. If I wasn't expecting Romance in the beginning then I would have probably enjoyed this show a lot more I did right now. \\n\\n\r\nThere wasn't really anything interesting that occurred in the first half in terms of story. It's basically just an introduction to the characters, how the Flying Circus works which is surprisingly more complex than I thought it would be and a few Flying Circus matches which is so fun to watch because there was barely any still shots and it's all smooth and consistent. I want to talk more about the FC's rules. At first, I thought it would just be a simple race or touching the opponent's back to score a point but turns out there's more rules embedded in FC. It actually wasn't until the 2nd half where I completely understood how FC works. You know, just like Basketball. Simple yet somewhat complex if you're a beginner. \\n\\n\r\nNow, the 2nd half, where the actual story begins. I wouldn't say the 2nd half is where the show redeemed itself but I can say that it's better than the first half. Basically, the 2nd half focuses on a certain someone introducing a new play style to FC which is honestly a dick move except it's a smart strategy Remember when Basketball didn't have those 24 second shot clock? That's how I'll explain the new play style. Since this is a non-spoiler review, I won't explain it in detail. Even with the new \"innovative\" play style introduced, it shows us how Asuka will never give up on FC and how she's still going to have fun playing FC\\n\\n\r\nLast thing that I want to talk about is the comedy. The way they handled the show's comedy is horrible. Four Rhythm's comedy is a hit or miss and for the most part, it's a miss. There are a few hits though but like I said, the miss outweighs the amount of hits. For example, whenever Asuka show's her ditzy/clumsy side; instead of me laughing, I was annoyed. By the way, this is coming from a guy who has a thing for ditzy female characters. I think they're funny but there was something about Asuka's ditziness that didn't translate into \"hahaha\" but rather, into \"agh, her annoying side\". \\n\\n\r\nIf the show is going to have a second season then it's immediately going into my watch list because the final episode is the best episode that I have ever seen in Four Rhythm. Thought, it's a shame because it wasn't enough to save this series. The dogfight scene was just so amazing and Asuka's determination is one of the best that I've seen from her. Asuka was so close to being my favourite character in the series but that spot goes to someone else. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: (10/10)\\n\r\nThe Animation is simply beautiful. It completely fits with wherever the show is set and it looks so relaxing. It looks like they live in an island to me. The character designs are also amazing and if you look at the cover, you'll see Asuka's side boob. Yea..you'll see more of them side boobs in the 2nd half of the series. I already said this above and I'll say it again. The Dogfighting scenes are great..They're just so engaging and once a match ends, you'll want to watch more Flying Circus matches. There's also barely any still shots which makes the matches more exciting to watch. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Sound]: (9/10)\\n\r\nWhen I first heard the soundtrack that was playing in the PV, I knew that the show's soundtrack will be great and I guess I was right. The Dogfighting battle themes is where the soundtrack excels and every time I hear it, it gives me goosebumps and it makes the matches more exciting to watch. Now the OP and ED theme song(s)\\n\\n\r\nThe OP theme song is \"Contrail ~Kiseki~\" by Mami Kawada and the ED theme songs are \"a-gain\" by Ray  and \"Kimi Toita Sora\" by Ray. I love Mami Kawada but I feel like this is, by far, her weakest song. It's not a bad song or anything and I didn't hate it but compared to her other songs, this is her weakest song. Four Rhythm's (VN version) OP \"Wings of Courage\", which was also sung by Mami Kawada, is 10 times better. Though, I'm glad they played \"Wings of Courage\" in the final episode during the final FC match. For the ED, Ray delivers again with her beautiful singing voice. If you've heard her previous songs then the ED theme song should sound similar to Nagi no Asuka's OP and Ano Natsu De Matteru OVA's OP.  \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Characters]: (7.5/10)\\n\r\nTake a look at the character's list and guess who the main character of the series is. If you think it's Masaya Hinata then you're dead wrong because he's basically a non-existent main character. He didn't have any serious role in the series other than training Asuka how to fly. Hell, he \"didn't\" even fly nor did he participate in any of the FC matches. He feels more like a side character to me. Though, they did explain in the show why Masaya doesn't participate in the FC anymore but it still bothered me that he's the supposed main character but all he was doing is coaching Asuka. If the series were to get a second season and Masaya flies again because Asuka inspired him to play in FC again then I will forgive Masaya's non-existent MC role here. \\n\\n\r\nThe character that felt like an actual Main Character is Asuka Kurashina. Not only does she get more character development than Masaya but she also gets more screentime than Masaya. Honestly, I love Asuka's character because of her passion in FC and her determination to never give up. Due to her determination, she manages to do (and master) a special move that is supposedly hard to do. At the first half, she's a ditzy, clumsy character who barely knows how to fly but in the second half, she's more of a strong female character who chased her passion and never gave up on FC even though she was horrible at flying. In the second half, she manages not only to fly but also master the special move. \\n\\n\r\nThe 2nd character that also felt like an actual MC than Masaya is Misaki Tobisawa. At first, I honestly did not like her because of her cliched personality. She loves to sleep and eat and the fact that she puts a \"nya\" at the end of her sentences is the sole reason why I didn't like her in the first half. However, in the 2nd half, I began to like her character and she became my most favourite character in the series. It's mostly because of her character development in the 2nd half. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________  \\n\r\n[Enjoyment]: (7.8/10)\\n\r\nEven though the show suffers from lack of romance and there's minimal drama in the series, I still enjoyed the series because of the FC matches and Asuka and Misaki's character in the 2nd half which was a lot better when they were first introduced.  \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[VERDICT]\\n\r\n\"Ao No Kanata No Four Rhythm\" or \"Four Rhythm Across the Blue\" in English could have been something great if they stuck with the VN and made this series a 2 cour but instead what we got is an average/decent slice-of-life show about Flying Circus. If you're looking for a relaxing slice-of-life show that focuses on a fictional sport then this is for you. If you're looking for romance however, then I don't recommend this anime. You're better off playing the Visual Novel.    \\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]: (7.5/10)\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Relaxing Slice of Life show that's about a fictional sport\\n\r\n+FC matches are exciting to watch\\n\r\n+Outstanding Animation\\n\r\n+Great Soundtrack, most of it are battle themes that plays during FC\\n\r\n+Asuka's determination and passion in FC is what makes her a likable character\\n\r\n+Great and Exciting Ending\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Gonzo deciding not to adapt the romance element from the source material.\\n\r\n-Comedy is mostly a miss\\n\r\n-Asuka's personality was annoying for the first 3-4 episodes",

            "content": "For centuries, it has been man's dream to fly.  Because of the Wright Brothers, we finally have the technology to do so, and as such, have been able to soar into the skies, give or take the method.  But we have never truly been able to fly by ourselves.  But here, we have Aokana, an anime about flying, and the sport that goes along with it known as Flying Circus.\r\nStory:  In the world of Aokana, the world has developed special footwear called Grav-shoes, a kind of footwear that allows for the user to utilize anti-graviton particles in order to essentially defygravity and fly.  In order to make the idea of Grav-shoes more fun, a new sport known as Flying Circus was developed, creating a brand new activity that one could do with their new shoes.  It is here where we meet Kurashina Asuka, a bright and optimistic girl who dreams of soaring in the skies.\\n\\n\r\nAt its core, Aokana is centered around Asuka and her journey through the sport of Flying Circus, or FC for short.  The show is centered around her and her group of friends in the FC club at her high school, participating in competitions and aiming to become top FC players.  So more or less, this is your standard tournament/sports anime that focuses around beating stronger opponents and progressively getting better and better as time goes on, right?  Well...no, actually.  \\n\\n\r\nContrary to what the show looks like from the outside, Aokana has a surprisingly deep set of values that it showcases.  It really hammers in what it takes to be good at a sport, and the satisfaction of winning when facing someone tough.  In fact, the characters are shown to more or less only be fighting the same opponents, completely disregarding a 'stronger challenger approaches' style of story.  The anime shows us the true feeling of losing and how heartbreaking it can be, as well as the beauty and satisfaction of winning, all things that you wouldn't see in your generic tournament anime where the protagonist just barrels his/her way through each match without trying and winning every time because he/she is that good.  There's genuine feeling when it comes to seeing the growth of these characters and it really made me like this show and want to continue watching.  The progression is far better than what I had expected it to be, and I was happy to receive such a surprise.\\n\\n\r\nOn the downside though, the show has some issues with some of its presentation.  Some aspects of the show feel cliched and everything is tied up with a nice ribbon bow, so the plot is predictable in that regard.  Additionally, the show does have quite a lot of moe-affiliated moments where the show does tell you once again \"Hey, we're a show with a bunch of cute girls doing some cute stuff\", which it is.  It takes away from the serious atmosphere a little bit, but for me, it really wasn't really a problem.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, while there were problems and issues with its presentation, Aokana had a message that was far deeper than I thought it would ever have given what it looked like on the outside.  The show had good progression and a good mix of good to bad moments that helped improve character growth and, despite its appearance of one guy surrounded by several girls, IS NOT A HAREM!  (I know, shocking right?  We can have an anime with that kind of character setup WITHOUT having romance!  Gasp!)\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Interesting story concept  (The sport is simple, but surprisingly complex.)\\n\r\n+  Great message and themes throughout\\n\r\n+  Not a harem despite what we get for a cast\\n\r\n-   Has cliched and/or predictable moments that do take some credibility of the show away\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:  The cast of Aokana isn't particularly big.  As mentioned before, the show more or less focuses on a relatively small group of characters where they all fight amongst each other in the sport.  There're no \"Challenger-kuns\" anywhere once the rivals have been established, and the show takes its time to develop its cast.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, we have our spunky and optimistic main protagonist, Kurashina Asuka.  Asuka is the very definition of optimism.  Her dream is to soar high in the sky, and most of her lines involve things being \"amazing\" and being \"spectacular\" to the point that it's actually somewhat annoying.  A somehow gifted natural at FC, Asuka is sort of that 'prodigy' kind of character who gets stuff or is able to do complicated stuff relatively easy in the series, even to the extent that even towards the end, she is able to handle more difficult maneuvers or strategies that would ordinarily taken someone else weeks or even months to accomplish.  As a character, she is more of a catalyst for things, as she evokes feelings and aids in the character development for others, without really changing much herself.  She does have bouts of sadness and some time dedicated to her recovery after a loss, but she's the type to get back up on her feet quickly, so there's really no worry there.\\n\\n\r\nThe people that are interesting are both Mashiro and Misaki, the two other members of the FC club that Asuka belong to.  As a senpai loving kouhai and a nyanko respectively, Mashiro and Misaki are more of the characters that project and showcase the quality of what it is to have ups and downs in a sport, as each of them have dedicated time to their characters.  These areas of the anime are sections where I think both the message and the anime really shine, because they're both very realistic examples of what it means to participate and try to get really into a sport since both of their mini character arcs are dedicated to resolving their own insecurities and strengthening the qualities that they possess and turning it into in the series' words, \"Their own FC\", aka, their own style of playing.  \\n\\n\r\nIf I was to make a complaint, it would have to be geared towards Masaya Hinata, our male character guy.  Masaya is a character who really...doesn't have all that much importance in this series.  As Aokana was originally a VN before getting adapted, Masaya is the player character and is dictated by the actions of the player.  In the anime, Masaya more or less plays a supporting role to the series, which is fine since I'm all for a series with 1 guy and a bunch of girls that isn't a harem series, but they try to give an explanation and time to his backstory and why he decided 'never to fly again' which just ends up being incomplete and very lackluster.  It is by far the weakest aspect of the characters by far, which is surprising since the side characters not only get more screentime, but more development than our so-called male protagonist here.\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters are definitely a side cast that has more worth to this series than most anime I've seen.  Other FC players like Shindou, Inui, and Rika get little moments dedicated to them to add onto the message that the show coaxes in, and Madoka, who is more or less the comedic straight man to everyone (poor Madoka).  Point being, there are members of this side cast that deserve mention, and only add to this show since a good number of them actually develop along with the series, if only for a little bit of character development.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Great character development\\n\r\n+ Good focus on main females and their development\\n\r\n+ Side cast members also get development\\n\r\n-  Asuka is a bit too perfect sometimes and gets a bit annoying\\n\r\n-  Masaya, the supposed main character, is basically nonexistent to this series\\n\\n\r\nArt:  Produced by Gonzo, Aokana boasts a very high quality and whimsical looking style for Aokana.  All of the colors have this shimmering bright sheen to them that reflects the sunny and bright feeling that the show evokes, creating this wonderfully colorful show that looks very pleasing to look at.  The characters also look very nice in conjunction with the background and move very fluidly in terms of the normal animation fluidity.  The artstyle is heavily moe-centered, as the characters, girls in particularly, are drawn in a very cutesy style coupled with some cutely exaggerated moments at a shot at comedy and cute pictures.  I say this because there are people that REALLY hate moe, so I just wanted to mention it here.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that the show has is effects, and lots of them.  The grav-shoes create contrails when the fly, and the effects of those are just really stunning to look at.  One thing that does bug me about the anime is the fact that they utilize 3-D CGI very often when they're trying to make a flying scene.  Using CGI for stuff like this is understandable, since the characters are moving very fast, and the amount of frame per second in order to create something like that would be time consuming to say the least, but the CGI is done in a way that really looks obvious, especially due to the fact that the fluidity of that particular scene looks stranger than it normally is.  (Also, there really isn't much fanservice to be had.  We get like...1 bath scene or so, and that's about it in the way of fanservice.)\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Really nice artwork\\n\r\n+  Great effects\\n\r\n-   CGI wasn't meshed well and stood out easily\\n\\n\r\nSound: The OST for Aokana is very fitting for the series.  The entire OST is more or less performed with airy instruments like the flute, in order to keep up with the theme of flying up and whatnot.  The OP \"Contrails\" is a very vibrant and uplifting piece that fits with the positive, soaring feeling that the characters have when they sprout their wings and lift off.  It's a very happy song that while doesn't have a staggeringly large amount of memorable factor to it, it's still a good song.\\n\\n\r\nThe ED on the other hand is a more toned down song that has a similar soaring feeling to it.  But instead of soaring high, the song more or less drifts around and glides.  It's not particularly a song that I feel lacks in comparison to its OP.  It's not a bad song, but its calm and generic sound really doesn't really do the song any favors for being particularly memorable.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Good, fitting music\\n\r\n-   Not really a memorable OST\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment:  Aokana was that one show this season that out of every show in my watching list I thought would turn out to be a surprisingly good show, a dark horse that was good, but no one would watch.  And now, after finishing it, turns out, I was right.  It has its flaws and its problems, but honestly?  I really think that this was a good show; an unexpectedly good show.  \\n\\n\r\nDid I like this anime?\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, I really did.  I liked it far more than I thought I would.  It's unassumingly cute exterior hides a really deep and meaningful set of themes that was not only well tackled, but really played into why I think that this anime deserves far more attention than it gets.  Hell, the OP has the phrase \"True Battle comes After Losing\", and that could not be more true to what happens in this show, and in real life.  Also, flying shoes.  Science, get on it.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this anime?\\n\\n\r\nOk, I'll be honest, Asuka is a bit irritating.  Her constant optimism is a feature of the anime that really doesn't fall, which really isn't a good thing.  She sees the bright side of practically everything and doesn't falter which in a sense, clashes with what this show was trying to convey.  In addition, Masaya was just NOT used.  He had so much potential, and could've really added a lot to the series, but in the end, he was more or less shoved to the side and wasn't really as important as he could've or should've been.  (And yes, I know that Asuka IS the main character here.  Doesn't mean we couldn't have devoted more focus to Masaya.)\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime?\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I think that this anime is definitely worth a watch.  While it looks all cutesy and moe on the outside (which...it honestly does do a lot, quite a bit actually...), what the show tries to tell us with its themes gives the show far more worth than your seasonal generic moe show.  It tells us that enjoying the things we like doing is more important than winning or losing, and that work has to be put into something in order to get better, and it conveys these messages so well!  IMO, Aokana is an underrated show from Winter 2016, and despite its flaws, is still worth a watch.",

            "content": "It took me far longer to get this review out than I had originally planned. But alas, it's here!\r\nAoKana was a series that I was extremely hyped up for, without a doubt more than anything from the Winter 2016 season. Why? Delving a bit into the past, I read three routes of the visual novel back in June of 2015, all of which were self-translated using my knowledge of katakana/hiragana and a dictionary. It took a very long time, however I thought it was well worth it in the end simply because of how much I enjoyed it. Well more than enough to throw itin as one of my top 3 visual novels of all time, which is a pretty large thing for me to say given that I've read quite a few of them in my life.\\n\\n\r\nAoKana was a series to have its anime adaptation announced before the visual novel had even come out, which was about a year and a half prior to the anime's first episode original air date. Was I a bit skeptical by this, given that it likely means that the anime's only goal will be to advertise a brand new visual novel and not as much to be a good anime? Of course I was. However, what made me believe that this anime would be hard to screw up was just how much adaptation potential the visual novel had.\\n\\n\r\nNow, what do I mean by that last statement? Basically, I felt that the visual novel would've fit far better within the medium of anime than it would in its visual novel form. In a way, I thought potential was being wasted by it being a visual novel, despite how good of a visual novel it was. So, to me, it would be extremely hard to screw up this adaptation, even if the studio in charge is one with as lousy of a history as Gonzo. That is, as long as it isn't rushed... which, sadly, the announcement of it only being 12 episodes long made me believe that it would end up pretty rushed.\\n\\n\r\nSince you can, obviously, see my score of the series, you probably already know what I'm going to say about it, however let's still get on with the review.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nI don't want to say the story of AoKana is cliche, because it really isn't. It deals with sci-fi themes involving humans being able to fly, and a sport that's never existed outside of the universe of AoKana. However, the way these themes are dealt with is a bit cliche/genetic, in a way.\\n\\n\r\nMeet our main character, Masaya Hinata. He has decided to quit the game that this anime is based on, Flying Circus (FC), forever. That is, until he meets a girl named Asuka Kurashina, who has always dreamed of flying in the sky. When she learns about FC from Masaya, she decides that she wants to play more than anything, and also asks Masaya to be her coach. Masaya eventually agrees to be her coach, which means he must continue to make FC a significant part of his life, despite no longer wanting to be a part of it.\\n\\n\r\nDo you understand how I say this is cliche in its own way? Despite the fact that it deals with completely fresh concepts, such as humans being able to fly and a sport that has never existed outside of this universe, the entire grabber of the series is still just a chain of cliche, generic, overused events that have happened far too many times in anime. Guy never wants to play a certain thing ever again for what we can likely assume is because of a past event, but suddenly a cute girl is so interested in it and wants him to help her through it, so he decides to abandon his own morals and help her. Sounds kind of familiar, doesn't it?\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's really all AoKana is for the first 4 or so episodes. The entire situation and the events that happen have been used far too many times to consider anything but generic. However, it's when you're able to slog through those first 4 episodes that you realize how good this series truly is. But first, sadly, I need to talk about what makes those first 4 episodes as bad as they are.\\n\\n\r\n1. Everything's been used a million times.\\n\r\nAs I said above, the first 4 episodes are really generic. As Asuka wants to start playing in this new sport, she joins her school's sports team, and is met with other cute girls that basically surround Masaya the entire time. It's then that we learn that the uniforms used to play FC are really tight and slightly skimpy outfits that bring out the T&A of these girls. Then, a string of really cliche things happen, such as the girls having sleepovers or being caught in awkward situations, going to the mall together to get Asuka the FC gear she needs to play, and fanservice. LOTS of fanservice.\\n\\n\r\n2. The pacing and quality is terrible.\\n\r\nAs I originally predicted, the first 4 episodes of AoKana are definitely rushed. Things go by way too fast to really consider them \"remarkable\" in even the slightest way, and you're given almost no time to savor the events that happen. The ONLY time that the pacing slows down is when you WANT it to be rushed; during massive fanservice scenes, like bath scenes and the like.\\n\r\nAs for the quality, there are TONS of DBZ-style continuous three-frame animation sequences that are used to cut down budget while still making it look like things are happening. Again, this only changes during scenes of fanservice. Things like that are good for boosting sales of the source material.\\n\\n\r\n3. It's BOOOOOOOOORING.\\n\r\nIt honestly DOES feel like not a whole lot is happening throughout these first 4 episodes, despite that being the exact opposite. What do I mean by that? When you finish the first 4 episodes, you will think back and only really remember the character introductions and what's happened to develop them thus far. The story progression won't feel like much has happened, but that's far from the truth. This is where we go back to it being extremely rushed. It's so rushed that far too many things are cut out that shouldn't be, and thus it feels like nothing has happened when in reality, quite a bit has happened. Like, lots. This was a major flaw that I feared when it was announced that AoKana would only be 12 episodes.\\n\\n\r\n4. Character progression\\n\r\nOverwhelming character progression doesn't really sound like it'd be a bad thing to most people when first hearing about it, but in the first 4 episodes of AoKana, it KINDA is. While I, personally, didn't think it was all that bad, many other people did. By as early as episode 2, there were people out there who were already getting sick of Asuka's character, which really shouldn't have been the case so early on. Her character was one that was meant to be adored quite a bit. This was a slight problem for Mashiro as well, but I didn't really hear a lot of complaints regarding her, so I supposed all is well there.\\n\\n\r\nAlright, so I know what you're thinking so far. \"Why the hell did you give this an 8/10? This sounds like a piece of crap so far!\" Honestly, that was my goal here. To make the series sound like total crap up to this point. Because, in all honesty, that's really what it was up until episode 5. It sucked. To the point where I ended up dropping it until about a month after it had finished airing, despite how anticipated I was to watch it originally.\\n\\n\r\nThen, we get to what I like to call the \"meat and potatoes\" of the series... the good part, the part that was right on-par with the rest of the visual novel, and that was just as I had expected from an anime adaptation of this wonderful visual novel: something that I could even say was BETTER than the source material.\\n\r\nI probably wouldn't go as far as to actually say that, but at the very least, both were equally as good from this point on.\\n\\n\r\nEPISODES 5-12:\\n\r\nIt's almost instantly notable how much better the pacing is in episodes 5 and 6. You're able to savor almost everything that happens. Also, the quality of the show looks and feels much better; very little fanservice happens beyond reason, the art looks much more fluid, and there aren't really any situations where three-frame animation would take center stage and lower the quality of anything else. It all looks done well, and it made me happy how much better it was than the first 4 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe story begins to actually take off in episode 7, where we learn a lot of things that are crucial to the rest of the series, as well as crucial to some things that happened in past episodes. Mainly, the past of some characters, as well as within the psyche of another dominant character.\\n\\n\r\nI think episodes 8-12 were without a doubt some of the best episodes I've ever seen in anime, or at the very least, some that I enjoyed the very most. What I really dislike about reviewing is that I can't go into depth with that without spoiling, but at the very least, listen to my words. The storytelling is incredibly well-done, the characters are delved into deeper and deeper outside of just continuous progression like in the first 4 episodes, and things start to matter a lot more. You start to become more and more attached to the characters/story of this series, maybe even more than you ever imagined you could, given how badly the first 4 episodes were done.\\n\\n\r\nI also want to give my props to the director. Sometimes, poor directing can lead to a series being far worse than it really is, despite how good the story/characters may be. The directing of AoKana was top-notch, done perfectly for what it's worth. And I also LOVED that Wings of Courage was used in episode 12. Thank you for that. That made my entire day.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall, the story of AoKana goes like this:\\n\r\nEpisodes 1-4 = no\\n\r\nEpisodes 5-7 = yes\\n\r\nEpisodes 8-12 = HELL YES\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of AoKana are some of my very favorite to ever come from a visual novel. This wasn't really changed very much in the anime adaptation, aside from the first 2-3 episodes. The personalities of all the characters were kept almost exactly the same, and were only skewered a bit in the beginning but were quickly put back on track.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, Asuka was my favorite. I do agree that she was depicted to be far more annoying and clingy than she actually is in the first 2 episodes, and the constant \"COACHY!!\" that flew out of her mouth every 5 seconds did become obnoxious after a while. But, as I implied above, this was a very short-last thing. Even during episodes 3 and 4, which I also thought were very lousy and unworthy of being a part of this series, I still thought Asuka's character was great and depicted well for what we were given.\\n\\n\r\nBesides Asuka, there was no character I liked a great deal, but that doesn't change the fact that they were still depicted very well in accordance to the series as a whole. Were those other characters perfect? Obviously not, or else I would've loved all of them! Nah, but they were still far greater than typical generic harem bait characters that you'd usually see in a series like this.\\n\\n\r\nIf I haven't mentioned already, there's NO romance in this series whatsoever. It's almost entirely based on the FC sport, which is a breath of fresh air given that any other series that was composed like this, especially one based off of a visual novel, would end up just being a huge harem where every girl wants to get with the dude. That isn't the case here in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nI really thought the characters here were done exceptionally, and almost perfect in a way. Asuka is without a doubt one of my favorite characters of all time, and none of the other characters had enough flaws to consider anything LESS than very good. Overall, almost flawless, just simply fantastic characters.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound:\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that key visuals/concept art of the anime made me realize, was just how similar the character designs were to the visual novel. That's a pretty rare thing, as visual novels typically look much better given that still images are used instead of actual animation. Minus Grisaia no Kajitsu and its sequels/prequels, VERY few visual novel adaptations have art that looks even half as good as it did in the visual novel.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some distinctive differences between the art styles of the two, with the most apparent one being the color choices. However, those are very simple to get used to, and you will get used to them very quickly. If you're someone coming into this anime without any prior reading of the visual novel, you will love the art from the get-go and that will be that.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound, however, was nothing special at all. While I did love the opening, the insert of Wings of Courage in episode 12, and thought the ending was pretty great as well, that was really the only exceptional pieces of the entire soundtrack. The rest of it complemented the anime pretty well, and I have no complaints overall. But nothing stood out enough to be considered that great.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said, however, I still have no complaints. It was still a good soundtrack, and I'll rate it as such.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal verdict:\\n\\n\r\nAoKana is a bit of a hidden gem. It is certainly not perfect, and really is nothing amazing besides the very last few episodes. However, it is still well worth the watch simply because of how fresh it is and how enjoyable it is. The cliche start to the series ends up taking a great new face by turning into something that's enjoyable beyond even some of the greatest anime out there. Everything changes after those first 4 episodes, and it becomes something almost impossible to dislike. AoKana is, without a doubt, good enough to consider the 2nd best series by studio Gonzo thus far, behind only Welcome to the NHK.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 8, it had its flaws in the beginning but the last 8 episodes are, for the most part, flawless in doing what they try to do. Delves much deeper than you'd ever expect in the later parts of the series.\\n\r\nCharacter - 9, every character did exactly what they were meant to, and Asuka did much more than that by being just simply amazing.\\n\r\nArt - 9, almost identical to the amazing art of the visual novel.\\n\r\nSound - 7, good soundtrack but nothing stood out aside from a few external things.\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9, there are few series out there that I enjoy more than this one. No kidding.\\n\\n\r\nOverall score for AoKana: Four Rhythm Across the Blue: 8/10.\\n\r\nA great series through and through, but nothing too amazing. It had its flaws early on but once it corrected them, it was pretty freaking incredible.\\n\\n\r\nWho would I recommend this series to:\\n\r\nIf you like sports anime, you'll surely like this one.\\n\r\nIf you're sick of the same cliches that happen in sports anime and want a fresh experience, you'll surely like this anime as it is an incredibly fresh take on the sports sub-genre.\\n\r\nIf you've never watched a sports anime before, this is surely a good place to start.\\n\\n\r\nOtherwise, if you want an enjoyable anime with good characters and fantastic art, you should consider checking out AoKana. Just remember, get through the first 4 episodes with understanding that it gets MUCH better after that. Don't think the entire series is going to be as bad as those first 4 episodes, because I can assure you that's NOT the case at all.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review! See you guys next time.\\n\\n\r\n- Alne <3",

The anime, which has a great main concept/story line, but tries to strive for a little bit too much.\r\n|Objective Review|\r\n|Story/Plot|\r\nThe anime starts out well, sets up the scene well for the characters and the sci-fi sport called \"Flying Circus\". The story progresses at a good pace, making it easy to keep up, yet keeping it interesting enough. However, as the series go on, the anime tries to reach too high. As a result, there will be a lot of plot lines that are not properly developed or finished. For example, the anime sets upHinata as one of the main characters with his trauma, but instead pushes him into the background into a supporting role. The supposedly romance story line is also left there hanging. There are a couple of signs of it, but it just never really happens or even starts to develop. Overall, it just seems like the main sports/tournament story line is very well put together, meanwhile all the other ones were ignored and unfinished in the end.\\n\r\nPlot Score - 6 \\n\\n\r\n|Sports|\\n\r\nAs this anime is focused all around Flying Circus, it's quite important to see what the anime can bring to the sports lovers. The fantasy sports at it's core is fairly simple, but it still has plenty of depth. There are a fair amount of moves/tricks you can utilize, though it would have been nice to see more. As for strategies goes, it's a little bit lacking. It mostly just deciding whether to race or battle. In the end Inui does show some actual strategy, but it still feels a bit lacking. The rules also have some holes, like why not just skip to the third buoy instead of stopping to intercept. But all in all, the sports is fairly easy to pick up, not to mention it's a very flashy sports meaning it's good to watch. It just lacks a little bit of depth.\\n\r\nSports Score - 7\\n\\n\r\n|Sci-fi|\\n\r\nEven though in the beginning we don't know too much about the Grav-Shoes, in the latter part of the series we learn a lot more about them. It really gives more options for the anime to expand the sports. One of the reasons why the sports aspect of the anime doesn't become too boring at the end.\\n\\n\r\n|Characters|\\n\r\nThe characters are mostly cute and nice, but nothing particularly outstanding. The drama part of the anime is nothing too serious, it's just mostly rivalry which is used nicely to develop the characters and their relationships. It's a nice touch that they use multiple forms of rivalries for different couples, there are couples where it's just a friendly/mutual connection where others might be more tense. However, the way they set up Hinata and Kagami, it only seemed right to see them a little bit more (especially Hinata with his trauma). This, unfortunately, is almost completely forgotten and it's almost like the creators totally forgot about their existence.\\n\r\nCharacter Score - 8(for the MCs) - 4(for the rest) - 5 overall\\n\\n\r\n|Art|\\n\r\nThe art is just spectacular. The drawing is clear and the shading is very fine and soft. The overall style also complements the anime with it's bright happy ambiance. The animation throughout the series is pretty consistent and the effects smooth in with the rest of the animation greatly.\\n\r\nArt Score - 9\\n\\n\r\n|Sound|\\n\r\nThe sounds are also quite outstanding. While the voice acting and music is fairly good, it's the sound effects that really made this anime/sport enjoyable to watch. They are clear, crisp and really do give off a feeling of speed.\\n\r\nSound Score - 8\\n\\n\r\n|The whole package|\\n\r\nAs a whole, the Flying Circus is a very easy to watch sport with spectacular audio-visual experience. The sport mechanics itself are nothing too special, but they do the job. If you want to just relax and watch some fantasy sports, then this is for you. Just make sure you don't expect nothing else other than a good tournament \"documentary\". If you expect to see good comedy, romance, support characters, drama then you will probably get disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, if i had to put it into words, the anime has a great core, but the shell surrounding it is very fragile and has holes in it. For what it's supposed to be, it does the job very well, but it strives for more and then just flops.\\n\r\nOverall Score - 6.5(if you look at what it's supposed to be then 7.5)\\n\\n\\n\r\n|Subjective review| (SPOILER alert)\\n\r\nMy relationship with this anime was like a love&hate relationship. While i enjoyed the tournament, i wanted to see Hinata and Kagami fly and compete so bad. And when they teased it at the end of episode 10 i was so hyped. And then they just skipped it... We only saw both of them fly for like 10 seconds in the whole series. I felt for Misaki (couldn't care less for Asuka)\\n\r\nand was kinda disappointed by how they finished her story line. But yes, wasn't so bad but i definitely was frustrated with quite some parts personally.",

            "content": "This series is rated lower than it deserves partly because many have judged the anime too quickly and dropped it since. Also, due to this, there are many lowly rated reviews for this anime. However, I'll be delivering my take on this anime.\r\nAo no Kanata no Four Rhythm - The REAL Proper Review \r\nAo no Kanata no Four Rhythm is an anime that could have had the potential to be a really great anime but was plagued by its origin. \"Eroge\" & \"Visual Novel\" Lets take a deeper look why it meets its demise when compared other animes of the season.\r\nMost anime are adapted &serialized from its manga counterpart. Manga are usually known & recognized for its deep plot/content. Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythm on the other hand is adapted from its visual novel known for its eroge. Most visual novels serving its \"eroge\" purposes have little to no real plot by default. Furthermore, its \"sports\" focus further reduce its chances for any deep plot to come by.\\n\\n\r\nHowever with Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythm, I think they have done pretty well despite being a \"sports\" anime. It's actually deeper than it seems and gets better at later episodes. \\n\\n\\n\r\nStory - 7/10 \\n\\n\r\nAo no Kanata no Four Rhythm revolves around a sports called \"Flying Circus\" The goal of the sports, by flying through the use of Grav shoes, is to score points by touching its buoys in sequence \"1,2,3,4\" or scoring a hit on the opponent's back. Or so it seems... This is when the real plot begins to surface. \\n\\n\r\nDo not JUDGE its plot before Episode 7, because that's where it really showed how deep it really is.\\n\\n\r\nWhen you love & know something so well, for example in a game, (In this case, FC) then all of a sudden, someone new just came & destroyed your concept of that. You become afraid, because the very thing you are so familiar & close to, becomes something you no longer understand. \\n\\n\r\nThat's what Misaki felt. FC became something \"dark\".\\n\\n\r\nAll these while, FC to her, was about touching buoy or hitting each other's back. A simple and fun sport. But Inui broke that concept. Instead of playing the game, she intensely pressures the opponent by restricting & denying whatever her opponent tries to do. It becomes a mental sports and makes you feel inferior & powerless. That's the \"beauty\" Inui and Saki sought. However, Asuka, being that carefree girl, may not fully understand the \"dark\" Misaki began to see. To Asuka, it is an exciting new territory of the game. But Misaki became afraid of FC, became afraid of Asuka. She could not accept how Asuka could think that way.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nBrilliant & Radiant. This anime is just beautiful to look at. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9/10 \\n\\n\r\nOne of the best anime's OST I've heard in a while. If you actually listen closely, you will notice. One example I can give is in Episode 6. \\n\\n\r\nListen closely to the OST:\\n\r\n05:04 to 06:02. \\n\r\n16:22 to 17:47.\\n\r\n17:47 to 19:45.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI love the contrast between Asuka and Misaki's mindset. As I've explained earlier. \\n\\n\r\nMasaya Hinata is your secretive hidden ace badass. He is shown to be rather highly intelligent.\\n\r\nAsuka Kurashina is your slightly clueless clumsy cute female MC with innate potential in FC that she doesn't really know about.\\n\r\nMisaki Tobisawai is strong female character that is also smart. Realizing the \"dark\" in FC.\\n\r\nMashiro Arisaka is your kawaii little loli with cute obsession with Misaki.\\n\r\nAoi Kagami is your ultimate hidden ace triumph card that you hope she would just come out and whoop everyone's ass. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI really like all the characters. There's a good variety in personalities and good comedy. I like seeing Asuka's sillyness, Mashiro's cute obsession with Misaki. Hinata & Kagami being the hidden badass retired aces.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8/10 \\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I really enjoyed this anime despite being poorly received by the community. A good mix of comedy, action with its beautiful art, amazing OSTs. Would definitely recommend to give this series a try and watch till the very end.",

It was very fast paced and many plotholes or even many important part, that would have make the story more exciting weren't animated. You dont get the feeling of something interesting and watch it merely because you somehow enjoy it how awesome it looks how theyfly and how the principle of \"their\" flying is. \\n\\n\r\nThe music was fine, nothing special or from heaven door, but atleast you can say that this was enough to make it an enjoyable anime. \\n\\n\r\nYou have too many characters to develop, yet only 12 episodes to animate. It's sad, since it could have been one of the top 150 contenders with a rating with 8~, but the budget was not enough. One the fatal weakpoints from becoming an actual good anime, since it lacks real development plus the  very fast pacing. \\n\\n\r\nIn the End, it is an enjoyable anime and you can watch it with a smile in your face. But dont expect too much from it and do not try to find logical aspects in it. It already stops with \"people flying and having a competition in it\". \\n\\n\r\n7/10",

So, she took up the so called sport and the plot pretty much revolves around how she got through all adversities to be an amazing FC player. Extra factors like having a coach who used to be one of the best players but quit due to personal reasons, becoming friends with the Best player of FC and more just adds up the entertaining factor to this anime.\r\nThis anime gives a very upbeatvibe, vibrant colours and great sound.\\n\r\nTo put it simply, it has a simple plot but the visuals and sound make up for the most of it, which makes it pretty much a decent anime for 2016.\\n\\n\r\nExtras: There's no romance at all for this anime.

            "content": "I\u2019m not going to waste your time and get to the point. This show is terrible. It gets worse as it goes along and there is nothing here that makes it worth your time. 0/5 and the only reason it\u2019s scored as a 1/5 is because I can\u2019t put a 0/5! There\u2019s nothing redeemable about it, but for clarification\u2019s sake, I\u2019ll explain. Also, no spoiler warning because this show is so bad that you\u2019ll be glad I spoiled it for you.\r\nA little bit of background on the show: it\u2019s an erotic visual novel, but adapted as something that has ALMOST no fanservice. Remember my phrasing,ALMOST, because it has a big effect on the show. Let\u2019s get into the juicy stuff now.\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\r\nBoring, uninspired, predictable. Nothing about this show is refreshing. The premise is boring, the setting is uninspired (school setting), and the plot progression is all over the place. Now, none of these would matter if executed correctly, but they aren\u2019t. The story takes 3 episodes to get started, and another 3 episodes for it to become watchable. It\u2019s essentially a sports anime, but with a sport that they made up. The plot is so predictable that when I predicted where the show would go AT EPISODE 1, it went that exact route. This is the definition of clich\u00e9! \\n\r\nA lot of scenes feel like filler with nothing worthwhile happening and is very skippable. It has a slice of life feel, except there is a plot that the show doesn\u2019t like to focus on. When a show doesn\u2019t focus on its own plot, why should the audience? \\n\r\nFanservice in this show is laughable. This show comes off as a kids show, but as I said, it comes from an erotic visual novel. The only reason some fanservice is left in here is because the creators wanted to get some extra Blu-ray sales. \\n\r\nThe setting of the show is at school. You may think that since flying is a huge aspect of the show, skirts would be a very illogical choice of clothing. Except that the girls wear skirts to school, which makes no sense whatsoever. Guys looking up their skirt would be guaranteed and happens in the anime. Furthermore, the design of the costumes for \u201ccompetitions\u201d are dumb. In a competition about speed, why would you wear baggy clothing? It\u2019d slow you down. Something like spandex would make the most sense because it\u2019s aerodynamic. Also, while in school, characters do moronic things that would otherwise get them expelled from school in real life!\\n\r\nThere will be info dumps. A lot of them. Every time something new is shown, you get info dumped on. Everything from \u201chow the shoes work\u201d to \u201chow to fly\u201d. Terrible writing, cheap dialogue, cringy jokes and characters, all bad. The main character has the special power of being amazing instantly and this is never explained. \\n\r\nThis seems to be a theme throughout the show. Not showing how things happened. They just expect you to know why something that happens is bad. One of the main conflicts is caused through unrealistic actions and it physically hurts me because of all the questions it brings up.\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\r\nCharacters are even more clich\u00e9 than the story. They all don\u2019t develop and follow the generic route of their archetypes. One of the characters quits, then rejoins through some terrible speech and they somehow win some competition through the power of friendship and cringy dialogue or whatever. They all only have one characteristic that defines them and could be replaced by just about any bland character and no one would be able to tell the difference.\\n\r\nCharacter interactions are unrealistic and uninspired. They don\u2019t feel like they would ever really happen and what characters say is more forced than terrible puns that people try to make. The main character\u2019s dialogue and voice actor make me stiffen up because of how the dialogue is said. The VA has a squeaky, annoying voice and says \u201cDESU\u201d all the time! It\u2019s annoying and breaks immersion. \\n\r\nThe other characters include: the one with the inferiority complex, the one that\u2019s obsessed with another character, the obligatory teacher, and the supposedly elusive character. You\u2019ll find out who\u2019s who by the end of episode one. The one with the inferiority complex is the one that quits and will rejoin because the plot needs them to.\\n\r\nWithin two episodes, characters have a better relationship than I do with people I\u2019ve known for 3 years, which would never happen. Interactions that would hurt these relationships have no effect like when the main male character gets to see the main female character naked TWICE because sales, stupidity on the characters part, and plot convenience. \\n\r\nIt\u2019s absurd that this much trash gets pushed through to a general audience each season. Anything else I say would be rambling and I feel like I\u2019ve asserted my points and explained them well. \\n\r\nSOUND\\n\r\nThis is the super subjective part because everyone\u2019s tastes in the sound department differs more than any other department. Like I said, I have the voice actors. They ruin the immersion of the show because of how annoying their voices are. They are all squeaky and over the top. They only help to reinforce the terrible dialogue by making it worse.\\n\r\nThe music is goes from forgettable to ear wrenchingly annoying. Sometimes I have to turn off all sound because I think it\u2019s so bad. The OP and ED don\u2019t bring someone into this show\u2019s world and seem lazy. There\u2019s literally nothing else to say.\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\r\nThis department is despicable. From moe to way too noticeable 3d cgi, this show uses all the worst art styles in the book. It takes skill to make animation look bad in this day and age, but this show did it without skipping a beat. \\n\r\nThe character\u2019s eyes keep moving on their faces as they talk, showing the inconsistencies with the animation. Their eyes are also always either too far apart or too close together. The 3d cg is noticeable for the \u201ccompetition\u201d scenes as they are used to save budget on animation and it still couldn\u2019t make the normal animation look good. The show switches back and forth because it shows the characters in 2d while they talk and in 3d while they are flying in these \u201ccompetitions\u201d. My final piece of evidence as to why this show is terrible!\\n\r\nFINAL VERDICT\\n\r\nAs I said in the beginning, the show is a 0/5. There\u2019s nothing good about it and going to sleep early would be more productive than wasting 3-4 hours watching this. If you want a GOOD sports anime, watch Baby Steps. Although it also has a low animation budget, it doesn\u2019t shoehorn in 3d cg for the main characters during their competition scenes and the important scenes are animated exceptionally well. That\u2019s all I have to say. Don\u2019t support this garbage and I hope you don\u2019t give this a rating above a 2/5!\\n",

            "content": "This is my first review on Internet so I hope I write this well.\r\nAo no Kanata no Four Rhythm is a awesome piece of work made by sprite and ruined by those who animated it. Only the people who actually played this godly game can understand this frustration.\r\nThe Story is about Asuka, a girl who moved to Kunashima due to her father's transfer and later comes across a sports called \"Flying Circus\" which uses GraShuu (A type of shoes which uses anti-graviton particle to make you fly) and then joins the \"Kunahama FC Club\" together with a classmate and a kouhai.\r\nStory 6/10. The Story presentedin the anime is completely different from how it really is. Getting from beginning, It was just Masaya alone who finds Asuka searching for her house keys. Also, it was him alone who uses the co-op system of the shoes to help Asuka get to the school on time. The terminal which is shown outside the school, is actually inside the building. (So if someone uses the Grashuu then he/she doesn't have to go all the way to cross the main gate). Misaki actually meets Asuka for the first time in the classroom. Masaya never knew that Mashiro family runs the Udon Shop untill Mashiro injures herself during the practice. It was Masaya alone Aoi-sensei asks to be the instructor for her flying lessons. Also It was just Masaya and Asuka who finds Satouin-san and Shion-senpai having an argument over the \"in\" letter plus Masaya actually doesn't see Asuka do the \"Air Kick Turn\" for the first time, as he closes his eyes not able to see her figure falling into the sea after the fail attempt to target Satouin -san's back, also it was Satoiun-san herself who explain about FC to Asuka. After the match Buchou bugs Masaya for like a week or so to join the club, and in the end, getting asked by sensei and convinced by asuka he finally decides to join the club. Also it was not Madoka but Masaya who takes the three of them to the Shirase-san's FC Shop. Though the story of the \"Anime Adaptation\" deserves 2, I gave it 6 just because it takes few points, just a few points from the original series.\\n\\n\r\nArt 6/10 - As expected of the art of these days anime's. It's well made. I have nothing to say about that.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10 - As the \"anime adaptation\" mixed few BGM from the VN, it's quite good to the ears. Plus the OP/ED are made quite well as well (Not as good as the VN's though)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6/10 - Aside Masaya, how they portrayed the characters in the anime are pretty much how they're like in the VN.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 2/10 - Just after watching the first two episodes of the anime, I raised the white flag, as I didn't wanted the headache I got from those two episodes to effect the surroundings.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 4/10 - I do know that the visual novel and light novels adaptations are pretty much like that and I don't wanna see the rest of the 10 episodes to prove that. \\n\r\nA piece of advice, if you know how to read Japanese then please play the game, I ensure you that it's 500 times better than the anime, but if you don't know how to read, then just wait for the English Translation to finish and then try it.",

            "content": ">> My review may contain a few spoilers, you're being warnedarcs/episodes would have been appreciated for me, but I don't have the right to blame too much about it since it's based on a visual novel and as such, have to be faithful to it in the different adaptations. \\n\r\nApart from that, the male protagonist, Masaya, is a retired FC pro player, coaching his friends of Kunahama high, after the latter were captivated from witnessing the FC sport. The realism of how this story progresses by excluding luck and unreal miracles, makes it different from what I used to watch in other sports themed anime.\\n\r\nIn spite of that, it's a pity that the show doesn't show FC at a wider scale.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe scenery, background and images are quite colourful, filled with light colours (mostly at least). The liveliness and attractiveness of the anime's sport is clearly underlined by the coloured trails left by the Grav-Shoes as well. You can say it's a kind of art which is manifesting under diverse forms, depending on someone's style, on top of being a sport. In a way, this aestheticism kind of mesmerize you (it does for me at least).\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe anime has a pretty relaxing, light opening, the same goes for the soundtrack, with some trying to underline the more intense atmosphere of major, skilled matches. Maybe, it's too soft and not enough pumped up, but who would want to disrupt the good and calm breeze anyway? It has its own and exotic wind enveloping and welcoming us.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, 13 episodes seem a bit short to show a certain, detailed development within the characters, but after fully watching it, that is not really the case. Each one of them has an inspiration to chase after, a good reason enough to light up a flame within them to boost them (Kazunari Shindo, Inui Saki...). Other than that, they make the anime fun and great to watch.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI truly liked watching the anime, too bad it is ephemeral because of a few episodes (sadly). A sequel would be quite neat, if it can remain all of the aspects of this one (or improve the plot's scale).\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nIt is a short but nonetheless great anime to watch, with a mixing between a thaw and tense soundtracks in their respective moments, as well as mesmerizing graphics/images at some point.",

            "content": "What a wonderful anime, just like the majority I sometimes doubted about the capacity of this, but it ended up being a incredible anime, I don't really know why people disliked this anime, perhaps the cuteness that they try to use is unpleasant, but I see no problem in it, the only thing that I have to complain is that when I first saw this anime until the end, it was a romance anime, which is absolutely not, no romance aspects, some days after the anime was finished it was modified, but yeah, now everything is correct, they also addedthe drama anime, can't really see many drama aspects and when it comes to be dramatic it's not a good drama.\\n\r\n     Story(9/10): The story is about a girl named Kurashina Asuka, she moved to an island that is know for having a tecnhology that can make people fly with, the Grav-Shoes, just like the name says they are shoes wich allow the wearer to fly, a simple flight mechanism that people in the island use to get around, after some events Asuka is introduced to the Flying Circus, a sport practiced with the Grav-Shoes wich consists in making points by touching flying buoys before your opponent or by touching his back, Asuka got impressed by this sport and end up practicing it with her new friends.\\n\\n\r\n     Art(8/10): The art is made to be cute, the anime tries to be a cute one, what does not fit well the anime, it is noticeable by looking at the girls cheek, always red and her voices, etc. However, the flying scenes are beautiful, there are some scenes especifically at the final game of the anime, that the art and animation are astonishing.\\n\\n\r\n     Sound:(9/10): I believe this is a really good point in this anime, I loved almost all the songs in it, the OP is great, the ED is beautiful, the songs at the last episode, that I believe are from the VN were awesome, also the soundtracks of the series is pretty good, I have nothing to complain about.\\n\\n\r\n     Character(8/10): The characters are not good, they could have been much better, there is little character development, it really could have more of it, that is the biggest problem about them, they're not bad characters, they have good personalities but some annoying parts about them too, if I have to say I think the characters are the worst part of the anime.\\n\\n\r\n     Enjoyment(9/10): Watching the flying scenes, watching how the characters get along, and how they get closer, I enjoyed a lot, the events of the anime probably won't let you get bored, it's beautiful to see the championship and seeing people flying, if it ever comes true I bet it will be a incredible feeling, to fly and to watch someone fly.\\n\\n\r\n     Overall(9/10): I think there is nothing bad on this anime, the characters are the worst part, but they are not bad, they are interesting in their own way, there's nothing that made me want to drop it so I don't know why people dropped and why it is so underrated, it is a great anime indeed.",

They get to compete against various FC players from different schools.\r\nCharacters 8/10:  Asuka is a newcomer to the school and the sport. She is also considered to be an underdog in the anime. Masaya is team's coach and understands the rules of FC. Mashiro is a young, talented player in FC and really loves Misaki. Misaki is an experienced player in FC. She is not a morning person and loves Udon!Madoka is the manager of the team. She is also caring and younger sister of Shion. Shion is captain of the team, and in his senior year. He is very passionate and experienced FC player, and is brother of Madoka. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10: I wish Flying Circus became an official sport (especially for the Olympics)! Personally, this is not like any other sport animes you would typically see. The anime has a great animation and sound. I really enjoy watching the opening; it gives an insight to what the viewers can expect. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 8.5/10: This anime is one of my favourites. It is definitely the one you should watch. Seeing the characters taking on the sport inspires and motivates you to try it as well. It can also motivate the viewers (especially the ones involved in sports) to never give up and to keep on trying. You can relate to the characters for the hardships they have endured and the lessons they have learned in the anime. I hope there is a season 2 in the future.",

My girlfriend and I decided to watch it weekly as she was very excited about it and after the second episode, I wanted stop. At that point there was nothing overtly impressive about the show other than maybe the art, of which I felt at the time was wasted on a story like this. I whined to her about how the artistic world(island) it took place in looked so stunning, and it was wasted on this random anime. IfI were to have rated this anime after the first two episodes, I probably would of given it a 4.\\n\\n\r\nBut, having finished the whole thing(to meet my special other's demands), I have to say, I have no regrets. I can even go back to the first two episodes and enjoy them now. This anime is genuinely good, it won't seem it at first, but once the story picks up, you'll be pleasantly surprised. The concept is actually very interesting and unique, the art is fantastic, and the story, while a little predictable, is very compelling. If you are out of \"MUST WATCH\" animes at the moment, I fullheartedly recommend this one.",

            "content": "In an alternate world anti-gravity shoes are commonplace worldwide that allows the user to fly around in the sky practically. Thus came the creation of a game called \u2018Flying Circus\u2019 Asuka Kurashina is a transfer student who has no idea about anti-gravity shoes. After being introduced to the anti-gravity shoes and the sport \u2018Flying Circus\u2019 by Hinata Masaya and Misaki Tobisawa, Asuka then decides to join the \u2018Flying Circus\u2019 club bringing about its revival. \r\nNow I\u2019ll be the first to admit it, I didn\u2019t think this anime was going to go anywhere and the subject of flying was going to be a small plot pointwhilst the series focusses on the romance aspects and such. Boy\u2026 was I wrong. \\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: \\n\r\nThe story focusses on our main heroine Asuka Kurashina and her progression in the Flying circus team and we have the inclusion of other characters from Kunahama academy and their progression within the sport. \\n\\n\r\nInitially the show starts off in what I perceived to be a stereotypical romance/harem anime. Asuka meets Hinata on the beach and helps her out. The anime however decides not to take the romantic route and focusses entirely on the sports aspect of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nStory progression was steady throughout the show and I only feel that the rushed ending was the let-down for me. However what surprised me was that the show made me feel that some romantic elements were going to be included, but shifted focus away from what was in the visual novel, which in my opinion was a fantastic call. \\n\\n\r\nRomance elements can distract the story of an anime unless that is the central theme. However being a sports anime the focus was entirely on the development of their skills and the determination of the characters to fight for the sport that they love. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\r\nAsuka Kurashina is a ditsy and adorable girl who had aspirations of soaring through the skies as a child. When introduced to grav-shoes, Asuka initially struggles to use them and with the assistance of Hinata and Misaki, Asuka learns how to fly properly and after being persuaded to join the flying circus club Asuka\u2019s skills in flying and as an all-rounder player excel greatly. Asuka\u2019s relationships with other members in the group is solid and especially with Misaki which I will delve into. \\n\\n\r\nMisaki Tobisawa is a stern and energetic girl who is personally my favourite character in the show. It was after introducing Asuka to flying circus that Misaki would try competing in the sport again. I felt Misaki\u2019s development as a character was really tested after being beaten Kazunari Shind\u014d. I really loved how the show goes about portraying the change in desire after losing to someone else and witnessing someone else better than you. \\n\\n\r\nThe last mentionable character is Hinata Masaya who is the coach of the flying circus team. Hinata acts as a mentor for Asuka and the others to help improve their game. Masaya is a lesser character in the anime in comparison to being the main protagonist of the visual novel.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\r\nStudio Gonzo does yet again a great job of animating this series, the use of 3D was apparent in some episodes, but I didn\u2019t find it particularly distracting. Colours were vibrant, but character designs were nothing special if I\u2019m honest. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nThe sound was very good for the series. I haven\u2019t listened to the OST yet, but particularly during the flying circus matches It was heavy with excitement and anticipation. The sound tracks did a good job to get me invested in the intense sports battles. \"A-gain\" by Ray was an excellent ending song for the anime and accompanied by the visuals of Asuka and Misaki highlighting the two\u2019s close friendship and rivalry made it very enjoyable. \\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict:\\n\r\nI was quite sure this anime would end up being another stereotypical adaptation of a romance visual novel and I was honestly quite surprised with the final product. Let\u2019s get this straight Aokana is a sports anime, something I didn\u2019t realize since old reliable Wikipedia branded It as a romance. When stripped away of its romantic elements you do have yourself an enjoyable show to watch. That doesn\u2019t however mean it\u2019s a justifiable show to recommend. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime started off quite slow actually. I also felt that there are a lot of other sports anime out there that could do equally as much justice as Aokana did, but just a difference in sports. I can see how the appeal of flying through the skies can make can the show an attractive proposition and to integrate a sport into this was a very good idea, to which I give the Reiko Yoshida applause. \\n\\n\r\nThe silly moments provided comedic relief weren\u2019t anything too amusing and at times Misaki\u2019s use of cat speech like \u2018Nya\u2019 can be annoying, though I'm just nit-picking the little things.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall I found this Aokana to be a very nice show about competitive flying sports. I recommend this to fans of sports anime looking for alternative sports to basketball or tennis.  Those looking for romance elements won\u2019t find any here, so scoot along. \\n\\n\r\nI give Aokana a 7 out of 10 and a recommendation of trying the first four episodes. If you don\u2019t like it then move on to something else after that. \\n\\n\r\nAlternative recommendations for this are Ro-Kyu-Bu! A basketball anime with cutesy girls who aim to become better basketball players\u2026 Yeah... Sorry guys I don\u2019t watch a lot of sports anime can\u2019t find much else to compare this to if im honest. \\n\\n\r\nLastly I suggest trying a visual novel called. \u2018If my heart had wings\u2019 vastly different in terms of story as a group of highschoolers set out building a glider to soar through the open skies. It came to mind when i watched Aokana. If you like visual novels check it out. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading guys. Have a nice day!\\n",

            "content": "Ao No Kanata No Four Rhythm was adapted from a VN so before the show aired, most people (including me) all assumed that there would be romance in this show. Turns out Studio Gonzo decided to go the different path by choosing the slice-of-life path. This caused some -- if not -- most people to dislike the show but not me. I thought this was an average relaxing slice-of-life show and that's it. \r\n[Story]: (7/10)\r\nIn a world where flying is as simple as riding a bicycle, Four Rhythm Across the Blue is set in a world where people can take to the skies by usinga technology called \"Grav-shoes\" which allows the wearer to fly to the skies.  Aside from simple transportation, people also use these shoes in a competition called FC (Flying Circus). To score points, they either touch buoys floating above the ocean, or their opponent's backs. \\n\\n\r\nI was really hyped for this series when I first heard about it back in October of last year. I was like \"Flying Circus?, Drama and Romance?! Hell yeah, I'm watching this series\". It was my most anticipated series of Winter 2016. Fast forward to January when the show started airing, my hype slowly died down after the 3rd or so episode. What slowly killed the hype for me? Lack of romance. If I wasn't expecting Romance in the beginning then I would have probably enjoyed this show a lot more I did right now. \\n\\n\r\nThere wasn't really anything interesting that occurred in the first half in terms of story. It's basically just an introduction to the characters, how the Flying Circus works which is surprisingly more complex than I thought it would be and a few Flying Circus matches which is so fun to watch because there was barely any still shots and it's all smooth and consistent. I want to talk more about the FC's rules. At first, I thought it would just be a simple race or touching the opponent's back to score a point but turns out there's more rules embedded in FC. It actually wasn't until the 2nd half where I completely understood how FC works. You know, just like Basketball. Simple yet somewhat complex if you're a beginner. \\n\\n\r\nNow, the 2nd half, where the actual story begins. I wouldn't say the 2nd half is where the show redeemed itself but I can say that it's better than the first half. Basically, the 2nd half focuses on a certain someone introducing a new play style to FC which is honestly a dick move except it's a smart strategy Remember when Basketball didn't have those 24 second shot clock? That's how I'll explain the new play style. Since this is a non-spoiler review, I won't explain it in detail. Even with the new \"innovative\" play style introduced, it shows us how Asuka will never give up on FC and how she's still going to have fun playing FC\\n\\n\r\nLast thing that I want to talk about is the comedy. The way they handled the show's comedy is horrible. Four Rhythm's comedy is a hit or miss and for the most part, it's a miss. There are a few hits though but like I said, the miss outweighs the amount of hits. For example, whenever Asuka show's her ditzy/clumsy side; instead of me laughing, I was annoyed. By the way, this is coming from a guy who has a thing for ditzy female characters. I think they're funny but there was something about Asuka's ditziness that didn't translate into \"hahaha\" but rather, into \"agh, her annoying side\". \\n\\n\r\nIf the show is going to have a second season then it's immediately going into my watch list because the final episode is the best episode that I have ever seen in Four Rhythm. Thought, it's a shame because it wasn't enough to save this series. The dogfight scene was just so amazing and Asuka's determination is one of the best that I've seen from her. Asuka was so close to being my favourite character in the series but that spot goes to someone else. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: (10/10)\\n\r\nThe Animation is simply beautiful. It completely fits with wherever the show is set and it looks so relaxing. It looks like they live in an island to me. The character designs are also amazing and if you look at the cover, you'll see Asuka's side boob. Yea..you'll see more of them side boobs in the 2nd half of the series. I already said this above and I'll say it again. The Dogfighting scenes are great..They're just so engaging and once a match ends, you'll want to watch more Flying Circus matches. There's also barely any still shots which makes the matches more exciting to watch. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Sound]: (9/10)\\n\r\nWhen I first heard the soundtrack that was playing in the PV, I knew that the show's soundtrack will be great and I guess I was right. The Dogfighting battle themes is where the soundtrack excels and every time I hear it, it gives me goosebumps and it makes the matches more exciting to watch. Now the OP and ED theme song(s)\\n\\n\r\nThe OP theme song is \"Contrail ~Kiseki~\" by Mami Kawada and the ED theme songs are \"a-gain\" by Ray  and \"Kimi Toita Sora\" by Ray. I love Mami Kawada but I feel like this is, by far, her weakest song. It's not a bad song or anything and I didn't hate it but compared to her other songs, this is her weakest song. Four Rhythm's (VN version) OP \"Wings of Courage\", which was also sung by Mami Kawada, is 10 times better. Though, I'm glad they played \"Wings of Courage\" in the final episode during the final FC match. For the ED, Ray delivers again with her beautiful singing voice. If you've heard her previous songs then the ED theme song should sound similar to Nagi no Asuka's OP and Ano Natsu De Matteru OVA's OP.  \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Characters]: (7.5/10)\\n\r\nTake a look at the character's list and guess who the main character of the series is. If you think it's Masaya Hinata then you're dead wrong because he's basically a non-existent main character. He didn't have any serious role in the series other than training Asuka how to fly. Hell, he \"didn't\" even fly nor did he participate in any of the FC matches. He feels more like a side character to me. Though, they did explain in the show why Masaya doesn't participate in the FC anymore but it still bothered me that he's the supposed main character but all he was doing is coaching Asuka. If the series were to get a second season and Masaya flies again because Asuka inspired him to play in FC again then I will forgive Masaya's non-existent MC role here. \\n\\n\r\nThe character that felt like an actual Main Character is Asuka Kurashina. Not only does she get more character development than Masaya but she also gets more screentime than Masaya. Honestly, I love Asuka's character because of her passion in FC and her determination to never give up. Due to her determination, she manages to do (and master) a special move that is supposedly hard to do. At the first half, she's a ditzy, clumsy character who barely knows how to fly but in the second half, she's more of a strong female character who chased her passion and never gave up on FC even though she was horrible at flying. In the second half, she manages not only to fly but also master the special move. \\n\\n\r\nThe 2nd character that also felt like an actual MC than Masaya is Misaki Tobisawa. At first, I honestly did not like her because of her cliched personality. She loves to sleep and eat and the fact that she puts a \"nya\" at the end of her sentences is the sole reason why I didn't like her in the first half. However, in the 2nd half, I began to like her character and she became my most favourite character in the series. It's mostly because of her character development in the 2nd half. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________  \\n\r\n[Enjoyment]: (7.8/10)\\n\r\nEven though the show suffers from lack of romance and there's minimal drama in the series, I still enjoyed the series because of the FC matches and Asuka and Misaki's character in the 2nd half which was a lot better when they were first introduced.  \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[VERDICT]\\n\r\n\"Ao No Kanata No Four Rhythm\" or \"Four Rhythm Across the Blue\" in English could have been something great if they stuck with the VN and made this series a 2 cour but instead what we got is an average/decent slice-of-life show about Flying Circus. If you're looking for a relaxing slice-of-life show that focuses on a fictional sport then this is for you. If you're looking for romance however, then I don't recommend this anime. You're better off playing the Visual Novel.    \\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]: (7.5/10)\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Relaxing Slice of Life show that's about a fictional sport\\n\r\n+FC matches are exciting to watch\\n\r\n+Outstanding Animation\\n\r\n+Great Soundtrack, most of it are battle themes that plays during FC\\n\r\n+Asuka's determination and passion in FC is what makes her a likable character\\n\r\n+Great and Exciting Ending\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Gonzo deciding not to adapt the romance element from the source material.\\n\r\n-Comedy is mostly a miss\\n\r\n-Asuka's personality was annoying for the first 3-4 episodes",

            "content": "''True battle comes after losing.'' (Spoilers)\r\nWhen I first watched the first episode I thought ''Wow, that was interesting and pretty bad at the same time. But just try not to drop it.'' I'm glad I didn't. This anime covered its bad parts and has become a lot better since the first episode. But still it has issues. They added drama and character developments in it but still with romance, better art and exciting music it could even deserve 9 out of 10. \r\nStory: 7.5/10\r\nThe story is about a girl who always wanted to fly, luckily there is a invention that makes people fly : FlyingShoes. That girl moves to an island(?) and starts using that shoes. But she can't fly well so her new friends start teaching her how to fly. Her dreams came true! What a happy story... Anyway, the main plot is about an interesting sport called Flying Circus (FC) and she starts being into it (long story... Watch the first episode and you'll understand). Then she and her friends start doing FC, the male character becomes their coach/director and they want to go to tournaments. Yeah story is going like that. Actually what matters about the story is matches. Who is going to win and what kind of cool moves and strategies is s/he going to use? \\n\r\nI don't like the characters that so OP and wins every match from ep 1 to final, so this anime is not like that. In the first episode main character couldn't even fly stable. My only hope from the story was that (characters improve their skills) and it happened. And I liked the final. And they expressed their main idea well in the final. ''True battle comes after losing.'' (Well, a lot of losing) and you should have fun while you are trying to win.\\n\r\nThe plot is classic sport or slice of life plot and it's interesting enough to continue so 7/10 is a fair score.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI generally didn't like the character designs but the match scenes and flying effects are really cool.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI don't like the OP or ED so much but OSTs are actually good and relaxing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThese kind of animes characters and enjoyment is much more important than story. ''But the characters are the worst part of this anime. They should've made the characters interesting. Even better art (character designs) would make them more interesting.'' I said when I first wrote this review. I still think it is one of the worst parts of this anime but when I kept watching I found the characters really interesting. They tried all characters to develop (which I liked) but it could be a lot better. Few episodes, the main focus was on the characters but not matches. We saw Misaki's real feels about the FC, Asuka and the ''FC King''. And Asuka was one of the most developed characters I've seen. The episode when she fell into the sea and she lost and she cried. Maybe the only time this anime used drama but it was good. The main problem is the male character. He is just directing the girls. 2 or 3 minutes we saw him flying but it surely wasn't enough. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nAt first it's really boring but I started to enjoy it after mid-season. Generally the match scenes are really enjoyable. You usually know who's gonna win but the tricks are really cool. But the main problem about the enjoyment is lack of comedy and especially romance. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nSo here is my opinions about this series. Could be a lot better? Hell, yes. Is it bad? Hell, no :)",

It doesn't introduce us all the characters properly one by one, but on the other hand it really emphasizes on the battles, which in my opinion are really a thing.  \\n\\n",

            "content": "For those of you that are expecting romance in this anime, don't expect any. There is ZERO romance in the anime. Don't get your hopes up if the romance aspect is all you care about. You have been warned.\r\nNow, Ao no Kanata is adapted from a visual novel. And I am a big fan of visual novels. This will means several things.\r\n1: The adaptation will almost guaranteed to be unfaithful to the original source.\r\n2: A 12 episode adaptation will NOT cover all the story lines and routes.\r\n3: My expectations will be kept low.\r\nThat's just how 99% of most visual novel adaptations go, so I wasn'tsurprised when the anime changed the main character from Hinata Masaya to Kurashina Asuka. Right from episode 1 they were already taking a different approach to the original source content, from a romance filled story to a slice of life version.\\n\r\nI can see where they were planning on going with this. Cut out all the romance in the anime, keep the anime PG-13 (visual novel is an eroge, after all), and leave the romance for those who want more after the anime to play the visual novel. The anime is ultimately an advertisement for you to go play the game. Smart idea, but if you're going to do that, TAKE THE STUPID ROMANCE TAG OUT OF THE ANIME, MYANIMELIST PEOPLE. If there was no romance tag in the first place, there would be a lot less salty people running around the forums right now.\\n\\n\r\nBut enough about romance. What about the anime in general?\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n-Great soundtrack (some of it was completely taken from the visual novel ost). The opening is probably one of my favorites this season. Shame that Mami Kawada retired. You will be missed.\\n\r\n-Great background artwork (water and skies were nicely done)\\n\r\n-Core of the story was very straightforward and easy to follow\\n\r\n-Great moe moments (the part I liked most about the anime)\\n\r\n-Slice of Life elements were done extremely well (as expected of director of Non non Biyori)\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-It is clear some of the characters got shafted from this adaptation. Rika, for example, is listed as a main character, yet she barely had any screen time. Same goes for Masaya, who was completely pushed off to the side as a supporting character (even though he was THE main character in the visual novel). Even some of the side characters could not hold their positions as side characters and just simply vanished from the face of the earth as the anime went on.\\n\r\n-The Flying Circus battles have CGI elements in them. While at times they do look very nice (last episode was a great example of good CGI), most of the times the animations look very stiff and artificial, making some of the action scenes somewhat lackluster and uninspired.\\n\r\n-They did a poor job explaining some of the rules and tactics for the Flying Circus sport. Sometimes some things would happen in the anime and you would scratch your head and wonder \"Was that move even legal?\" or \"Wait? You can do that?\"\\n\r\n-The lack of romance was really disappointing. They missed a lot of great heart wrenching moments from the visual novel that could have added an extra layer of depth into the anime.\\n\\n\r\nIf I were to rate this based on adaptation, I would give it a 6. This anime is an inferior version of the visual novel in every possible aspect. However, my enjoyment for this anime is a 7. They kept the core of the story from the visual novel and kept it fresh with comedy and wonderful slice of life elements. It was passable as a standalone, I suppose.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this to anyone? If you desire romance, STAY AWAY FROM THIS anime. If you like moe, sports, slice of life and drama, this may be worth checking out. It's a very chill anime that does not really break any new grounds. There is a sequel visual novel confirmed, so there may also be a sequel anime as well.\\n\\n\r\nI encourage anyone who finished the Ao no Kanata anime to play the visual novel. The anime only covers roughly ONE FOURTH of the visual novel. There is a LOT more story to tell. Also, you will get your fix of romance once you play the game :)\\n\\n\r\nThe concept of wanting to fly has always been a dream in many of our hearts, and this anime explores what it would be like if a flying sport existed. For that, I am thankful to Studio Sprite and Gonzo for bringing our childhood dreams some hope.\\n\\n\r\nFor other recommendations related to Ao no Kanata, I have heard many people compare Ao no Kanata to Air Gear. For my own recommendation, I would recommend Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate. KoiChoco and AoKana are made by the same visual novel studio (Studio Sprite), and they have the same joke character running around both series.",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nWhen I was a kid, say five years old or so, I liked picking dandelions.\r\nSpecifically, I picked them whenever I played soccer on my uncles\u2019 team. They were kind enough to help guide us youngsters to victory \u2013 at least, those who had such goals. For I, playing goalie and having zero interest in what was happening around me, happily took to weeding the ground. The ball rolled and the players ran, but I concerned myself only with the dirt and the dandelions before me.\r\nI was bored; I wasn\u2019t having fun. That element is keyto any sport, any activity: fun. Because if you are not having fun, then what is the point?\\n\\n\r\nAo no Kanata no Four Rhythm answers this question, with goals on the ground and dreams in the sky, as a surprising yet slightly subpar anime.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nFour Rhythm stars Asuka, a girl who has recently moved to the Four Islands Archipelago where people use a new piece of technology: Grav-Shoes. Granting flight, these shoes spawned Flying Circus, a competitive sport that tests one\u2019s endurance, speed, and abilities. After meeting Masaya \u201cCoach\u201d Hinata, Misaki Tobisawa, and Mashiro Arisaka, Asuka enters this new and exciting world that has always been right above her.\\n\\n\r\nFlying Circus, or \u201cFC\u201d for short (and from here-on-out), is the cornerstone of the anime. The show takes its time in explaining the various rules: how points are scored, what fighting entails, and so on. It details the different styles, like being a fighter or an all-rounder. It introduces a myriad of moves. Sonic Boost, Pentagram Force, Air-Kick Turn\u2026\\n\\n\r\nAs such, the anime does a reasonable job of creating, from the ground up (if wordplay is permitted), a brand new, never-before-seen sport.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, FC is prone to the biggest problem that the anime has: lack of interest. The cast fly around and create intricate patterns and bring the battle to each other. But most of the time, the drama the sport tries to generate does not stick. One major reason is misplaced satisfaction. Just touching a buoy or swatting at an opponent does not have that feeling of accomplishment because it seems too easy most of the time. Another reason is the lack of urgency. Many times, the duelists ignore certain routes, slowing down the action in an otherwise fast-paced game. And the stakes at hand are just not high enough. Four Rhythm does not give a lot of context in terms of potential accomplishments, tournaments, and end goals. I.e., their efforts do not amount to much. Not that everything feels pointless, but it certainly comes off as not as important as the anime tries to make FC out to be.\\n\\n\r\nAltogether, it makes the drama and the sport much less interesting. An unfortunate outcome.\\n\\n\r\nOnly with FC itself, however. For the narrative holds some power in terms of its themes. More specifically, the show explores a concept that most sports players encounter: fun versus fear.\\n\\n\r\nMany people start off playing a particular sport because it is simply fun. Kicking a ball, diving for a catch, or flying in the air with Grav-Shoes unlock a sense of wonder from the get-go.\\n\\n\r\nEventually, some want to take their game, per se, to the next level. They want to compete against other skilled players. But what they find is that some people are far beyond their own capabilities. Try as they may, their skills never match up to that person who is just slightly better. In other words, they cannot win any more.\\n\\n\r\nThis description starts to get at Four Rhythm\u2019s stance on this theme. Asuka plays FC to have fun and nothing more. Coach and Misaki have fun, believing that they were better than their true skill set. Mashiro derives fun not so much from the game but from hanging out with the group.\\n\\n\r\nFor these and many of the characters, though, fear takes over. Fear of the unknown direction the game was going. Fear of the opponent they were facing. And fear of themselves, their own thoughts.\\n\\n\r\nAs the anime depicts, it\u2019s hard to face fear since it takes on these different forms. People sometimes cannot accept change. It\u2019s even harder to admit that there are other people out there that can be stronger. To put it differently, fear makes them think that \u201closing\u201d becomes the only option.\\n\\n\r\nAnd so fear takes over. Asuka becomes afraid of herself. Misaki fears Asuka. And Mashiro fears being left behind. Fear turns the sport not into a likable experience but rather into a dramatic incident.\\n\\n\r\nYet fear and fun go hand-in-hand. Shindou puts it best: \u201cBecause the fear of losing something shows that you enjoy it.\u201d Fear can remove fun, but it can also lead to fun, too. Asuka remembers why she flew to begin with. Misaki realizes that there is more to life than comparing herself to others. And Mashiro strengthens her person. Indeed, Saki\u2019s entire character \u2013 how she uses fear to dominate others in FC \u2013 highlights what fear and fun can do to others and for one\u2019s self.\\n\\n\r\nTaken together, Four Rhythm creates its take-away message: Winning and losing are not the be-all, end-all goals; having fun takes the crown.\\n\\n\r\nLooking at the rest of the anime, it has other highs and lows. The comedy, while not extreme, fits in comfortably among the drama. But the tale itself ends rather abruptly.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless, what matters most to the anime is FC and its theme on fear versus fun. The execution on both fronts varies, but the whole narrative is still a passable one.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nFour Rhythm\u2019s biggest issues lay in its art and animation.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, some positives. The CG work \u2013 usually used for small sequences during the battles \u2013 does not distract the eye. Also, the later light-shows that the competitors essentially put on are shiny. The anime\u2019s constant use of silly reaction faces also not only improves the comedy but also helps to curtail some of the errors seen in the art itself.\\n\\n\r\nBecause there are quite a few. Some characters are drawn with incorrect eyes \u2013 wrong pupil colors or placed on their faces off-kilter. Specific scenes are reused constantly, like a shot of the announcer or a duelist coming in from the right side of the screen in preparation to cutoff his or her opponent.\\n\\n\r\nAnd while the anime can have beautiful shots of the landscape, it more often than not has the view filled to the brim with blue water and cloudy skies. Granted, it has to be this way since FC takes place over the ocean, but it still does not lead to much detail or creativity.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation also suffers. Characters can sometimes move around with stiffness, and, worse, missing frames make their actions appear choppy. To be fair once again, the anime reduces the animation to give much of it to the FC battles themselves. But the actual animation nevertheless remains relatively low since, even during battles, the quality can dip from time to time.\\n\\n\r\nEven the character designs are not all that impressive, but they are at least stronger than the rest of the art. Asuka\u2019s flowing pink hair with special hairclip and Misaki\u2019s bows are the most notable aspects. And while their regular school outfits are bland, their FC attire at least add color and variety. More importantly, they bring about symbolism. Shindou\u2019s purple symbolizes his respectful nature, Saki\u2019s lime green symbolizes her revitalizing path, and so on.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of Four Rhythm are an interesting bunch.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the start, it appears as though the anime will follow the harem route. After all, multiple girls with different personalities and types surround Coach, the single male protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nBut that doesn\u2019t happen.\\n\\n\r\nInstead, the anime focuses on everyone but him. For a long while, Asuka, Misaki, and Mashiro (as well as many more) earn the majority of the attention. So much so, in fact, that he ends up being not a prominent protagonist but merely a simple side character.\\n\\n\r\nBut more on Coach later. The true star is Asuka. As the new person in town, she is quite unfamiliar with Grav-Shoes. Her flying evidence enough. She can barely keep herself aloft let alone fly in a straight line.\\n\\n\r\nYet she does not let this obstacle bring her (figuratively and literally) down. Indeed, her extremely positive nature is almost uncanny. She loves to make light of the situation. She is overly cordial even during duels. She smiles when she makes a mistake. She exudes positivity to the point that others cannot help but feel happiness themselves.\\n\\n\r\nHer stumbling flights last until she performs an Air-Kick Turn, an impossible move for a beginner and especially Asuka. It highlights her inherent strength at the sport, and what strength she shows. Over the course of the season, she moves from the worst of them all to the best in ages \u2013 a defined and satisfying arc.\\n\\n\r\nDespite her personality, though, it is not all rainbows. As she continually improves and continually finds FC so amazing, she encounters Saki. A fearsome opponent taking the sport by storm with her commanding and intimidating playstyle, she defeats Asuka in resounding fashion. To the point that Asuka questions whether or not she really haschanged from the weak girl that she had always viewed herself as being.\\n\\n\r\nMisaki experienced a similar conflict. Definitely not an early bird and a consumer of udon, Misaki is in a normal position at the start of the season. Besides these traits, she is known for her \u201czip-zap\u201d (as she coins it) FC playstyle and for her doting kouhai Mashiro. She joins the team early on, and, for a time, she is the best.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps obviously, Misaki\u2019s top status does not remain for long. At the first major tournament, she witnesses a lot. Much to her disbelief, she sees Shindou going all-out against Asuka when he did not do the same for her during their match. But when she hears Asuka actually liking the dirty match between Shindou and Saki during the finals, something breaks within her.\\n\\n\r\nIn essence, Misaki becomes envious of Asuka\u2019s skill, of her happiness. She retreats into herself, avoiding her friends and even FC. Later conversations with Shindou and Coach let her realize her trouble, one that goes along with one of the anime\u2019s main messages: She is afraid.\\n\\n\r\nAsuka and Misaki find themselves simultaneously dealing with personal issues, so it is only fitting that they get out of their respective slumps by supporting (and dueling) one another. Both find courage for themselves through each other, leading them down their own paths.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s another of Four Rhythm\u2019s main messages: following one\u2019s own path. Asuka channels Zephyrion, believing in the power of optimism and fun. Her playstyle reflects her mindset. Misaki tackles her fears much like her zip-zapping tackles her opponents.\\n\\n\r\nThe same can be seen in nearly every character. Mashiro \u2013 technically a side character \u2013 gets an entire episode all to herself about feeling left behind around Asuka and Mashiro. Hence, she relentlessly trains, learning more about herself than she ever realized. She adopts a speeder-fighter combo playstyle to fit not only her smaller frame but also to symbolize her adaptable nature.\\n\\n\r\nShindou is usually a calm, respectful leader. But on the FC battlefield, his true self \u2013 unsheathed anger \u2013 surfaces during particularly difficult bouts. His contrasting characterization accentuates his care and passion to the game.\\n\\n\r\nSaki, the ruthless speed-demon, explores the theme the best, however. Because she doesn\u2019t follow her own path. Instead, she obediently follows the commands of Irina, her Second. Saki and Irina tried to replicate Aoi\u2019s (the teacher that advises them) own playstyle to achieve a \u201cperfect\u201d way of competing. But, thanks to the combined efforts of Asuka, Misaki, and everyone else, Saki manages to break away from her self-made birdcage (to use their own ultimate move against them).\\n\\n\r\nOn top of the characters\u2019 individual growth and thematic presence, the anime layers many parallels between the characters. Asuka and Misaki\u2019s have already been discussed, but there are many more. Misaki admires Shindou for his strength. Rika was Mashiro\u2019s trainer, leading to a close friendship between the two. Aoi happened to be Coach\u2019s coach.\\n\\n\r\nThe most interesting is that of Asuka and Coach as well as Misaki and Coach. Both remember a \u201cfemale version of Coach\u201d that they played with and against. In other words, Coach was the first person to give the two girls their wings. Surprisingly, Misaki makes a remark about \u201cwho cares\u201d in an almost fourth-wall jab about how Four Rhythm will not be exploring Coach\u2019s character to any degree. Cheeky yet accepted, hearkening back to him never being the focal point to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, Coach is one of the anime\u2019s only missteps with its cast. The show makes a big deal out of his refusal to play FC. As though the major reveal and his (inevitable) resurgence will be groundbreaking (or maybe, given the context, sky-breaking). But his backstory is hastily shown and his not-too-impactful return lacks proper build-up due that aforementioned side-character status he earned from the start.\\n\\n\r\nSaki is one of the other missteps. While she does change as a person and does help to explore one of the anime\u2019s themes, her original character has a weak foundation. This weakness is due in part to how late into the season she is introduced. But mostly it\u2019s due to yet more hastily strewn together backstory. In other words, her connection to Irina and the struggles she has been through feel hollow when compared to everyone else.\\n\\n\r\nAltogether, while some snags are had, the cast of Four Rhythm are a strong bunch that prove said strength \u2013 be it at home or in flight.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe opening track for Four Rhythm focuses on a free-spirited feeling to match the free-flying spirits within. The vocal work is okay, but the gentleness of the piece does not help the loftier segments. At the minimum, the initial slow-into-fast singing makes the piece somewhat more fun to listen to, though not by much.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending track is a definite step up. Various pacing to the lyrics. Up-and-down instrumental work. Multiple singers in harmony. The ED, while not all that memorable, comes together as a mostly happy yet strangely cathartic piece that fits Four Rhythm well.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the rest of the soundtrack, it tends to lag behind the ED along with the OP. Some acoustic guitar riffs here, a lighthearted clapping tune there. Standard fare. At the minimum, the different sound-effects for FC carry some weight. When the characters shoot past or attempt a tricky maneuver, the anime makes sure to use some cool sounds to give the sport more oomph.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting is clearly better than the OP, ED, and OST. Misato Fukuen as Asuka gives the girl a sweet and happy voice that could brighten anyone\u2019s day. Azumi Asakura as Misaki blends catlike inflections into her words quite smoothly. And Nozomi Yamamoto as Mashiro adds extra energy into the mix with her different upbeat, angry, and overzealous ways of speaking.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nBack when I first started this one \u2013 now about eight months later \u2013 I called it an \u201cunderdog\u201d in the sense that it had untapped potential. I was somewhat correct.\\n\\n\r\nI was pleasantly surprised at how layered the cast members were. The show put a lot of effort into making many different connections between the entire cast, connections that I was not aware were going to be made. It was cool to see it slowly grow not exactly into a complex network but no doubt into a thorough one.\\n\\n\r\nI also found myself laughing at bits of the comedy. Asuka\u2019s positive nature, Mashiro\u2019s yuri feelings towards Misaki, and even Aoyagi, Madoka\u2019s brother, had me smiling as he advocated spirit in all parts of life (especially FC).\\n\\n\r\nBut there were still quite a few people that I did not much care for. Irina, Coach, and Aoi (as well as Shindou and many others) definitely had more to their characters, but I was not too much of a fan of their personalities.\\n\\n\r\nWorse still, I found the vast majority of the FC matches boring. The only one that actually caught my interest was the final one between Asuka and Saki. Many different (and new) moves were used, the battle meant a lot to both sides, and the final light spectacle was pretty pretty. While the others before had minute moments of intrigue, they were largely forgettable. And given that FC was such a major part of the anime, the total amount of entertainment I got out of this one never really took off.\\n\\n\r\nAo no Kanata no Four Rhythm is all over the place when it comes to execution. On the one hand, the music and especially the art have troubles. On the other hand, the story\u2019s thematic focus and the parallels between the characters make each strong in their own right. Overall, the anime flies higher than a dandelion in the dirt, but that is not really saying all that much.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, Flying Circus has trouble staying interesting, but a theme on fun versus fear permeates the anime nonetheless\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Bad, lame and error-prone artistic direction, below average actual animation, okay character designs\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, individual growth for Asuka and Misaki, a nice theme on finding one\u2019s own path, and many parallels between the cast members, brought down only by a mishandling of Coach\u2019s and Saki\u2019s characters\\n\\n\r\nSound: Bad, bad OP, okay ED, bad OST, nice sound-effects, above-average VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Bad, pleasantly surprising and some funny bits, but boring characters and matches bring down the experience\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 4/10",

I don't want to badmouth anyone, so I'll just leave this as is and move on.\r\nStory - 2\r\nA girl learns how to fly. Yeah...\r\nOkay really though there's nothing much to it other than that. Simple, straightforward, and boring.\r\n\"Don't include story summaries, users already have the synopsis written for them.\" WELL WHAT ELSE DO I SAY FOR THE STORY IF ONE LINE ACTUALLY SUMMARIZES EVERTHING?\r\nArt - 4\r\nNothing stands out. Generic character design. Background looks like god damned 50% render scale at 1080p, or 75% if youhave a 720p monitor. Might as well give this a rating of 2...\\n\\n\r\nSound - 2\\n\r\nOkay maybe I'm a bit spoiled by anime like sao, shigatsu wa kimi no uso, haikyuu, and uh I'm too lazy to look through my watched anime list. The music in this anime is really bland. It doesn't excite me, even though this is a sports anime. It feels like it's just there so you don't simply listen to people talk. Props for having decent sfx though.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 1\\n\r\nKurashina Asuka: A kuudere. If you don't know what that means, it means airhead. Well yeah she does think about flying most of the time. Anyways, she learns how to fly! WOW. SO AMAZING. An airhead as a protagonist probably wasn't that much of a great idea.\\n\\n\r\nHinata Masaya: Okay, here's like 40% of the reason why I *hate* this anime. Masaya was a professional player. He had a pretty interesting background that could actually bring about character development. Instead, the creators decide to dump all of this in the trashcan. What a great side character, \\n\r\nI mean protagonist that doesn't do **** during the entire 12 episodes right?\\n\\n\r\nOther \"main\" characters: wat. i tot they wer syde karakters too. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 1\\n\r\nugh... waste of time\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 2\\n\r\nArt doesn't contribute to how good an anime is imo. If it's not killing my eyes, then it's fine. That being said, I should be rating this anime a 1 and not a 2, but then again the girls are hella cute and they mesmerized me. Gotta give this anime a 2 for le girls :<\\n\\n\r\n[ This last section is pretty long. Read it if you want to know why I despise this anime. ]\\n\\n\r\nWhere should I start? I guess I'll start by looking through the tagged genres for this anime. Can someone explain to me where the drama is. I mean, if you're talking about melodrama then yeah... There is no drama in this anime. All there is is a bunch of kids making a huge deal out of nothing. Take Misaki for example. Asuka suddenly becomes good at flying, and Misaki starts to feel inferior. Instead of trying to get better, she cries like a little kid and quits the club. bruh....\\n\r\nA sports anime where the sport probably took 14 seconds to come up with... There was so much potential in anti-gravity boots, and what we get is a sport where people fly to corners of a square and d-dd--do-dog fighting. I'm gonna file a lawsuit for animal abuse. Realistically, the faster person will always win. It doesn't matter if the other player takes a shortcut. You can just fly right past them. If they chase, it's not that hard to turn your body around to protect your back given how easy it was for the characters to do \"something kick turns\". Dog fights will never happen. \\n\\n\r\nI want to talk about the characters a bit more. Some may argue that there was character development because a few characters become a bit more mature. Some may say that because there is, ever so slightly, character development, the characters are not one-dimensional and boring. I disagree. For one, the characters never really changed that much to make any impact on how they are as people. Their sole existence is to be with Asuka while she learns how to fly. The only character with the potential to be interesting is Masaya, but again he was discarded like garbage. Anyone could've taken Masaya's place as a \"\"\"coach\"\"\" and there would be no difference. So much for a main character....\\n\\n\\n",

I am not really into the sports genre, but I picked this up because I really liked the art style of it. It looks amazing! Other popular titles pale in comparison to this. The op of the series is really beautiful as well, song brings a tear to my eye almost every time I listen to it. The op really makes you connect w/ the characters.\r\nThe story isn't know knows what.There's a point about half-way where I really thought it was gonna go downhill, but they resolved it pretty well. My only complaint is that the should have really made it a 13 episode (or at least bring out an OVA) sort of like how Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko ended, where after the big event, they had an OVA to settle things w/ all the characters. I really wish they did this for Aokana, because the ending episode is just too abrupt imo. Definitely recommend though.",

            "content": "I'll try a review for once:\r\nTo be perfectly honest with everyone I have no clue how to review something based on the structure and all those stuff Lit majors can do. That's said I can rated it based on my own personal bias opinions.\r\nBefore I actually begin, I should probably address the elephant in the room. Aokana is a great show, great in the way that the overall theme didn't require romance. Let's take a look at the opening scene. The few slides after the beat drops, we see a few words \"The True Battle Comes After Losing.\" I don't see how in any way,where having this pop up in the opening could ever lead to any romance. The show has never been about romance, if you so duly desire some romance download tinder or play the visual novel. If you can't understand how this adaptation is ruined with romance, you haven't seen enough anime.\\n\\n\r\nNow that we've address that, the first thing I'd like to review is the animations. However bare in mind I typically enjoy mecha animations so I cannot say too much about this section. That said compared to the game CG (which I've not played yet) they were pretty accurate with some of the effects toned down. But much like most anime, there are scenes where people are drawn correctly, but as long as it isn't on the quality level of Rail Wars, then it gets a passing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters. Where do I begin? While each of the heroines are developed, most are lacking. Notably the Main Character from the visual novel. But once again THIS IS NOT A ROMANCE ANIME. Thus his role as a supporting character is a good choice and is fine to underdeveloped. In my personal opinion the true main characters were Misaki and Asuka. We see both of their emotions and struggles with the sport. And how the few words in the opening actually reflect this. However it falls short because of some characters. Their presence is so small that the anime could have been the same without that character or that scene in general (there are few trust me, you can't miss them). The characters as a whole are likable in the cast, but some characters could have had more of an impact, like Rika and Mashiro. But overall the cast is enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nNow I would go into the sounds, but unfortunately, I'm not particular good at describing it beyond saying each soundtrack and that insert, all flowed well with the show.\\n\\n\r\nNow onto the plot. There's a reason why I called this show \"beginner's luck the animation.\" This is one issue where sport shows fail at, and it's usually why I don't watch many, but it always shows the character having some natural talent in the sport that they had no knowledge of. This is taken up to 11 when Asuka decides to have a match with another student on the day she just learnt to fly. Now you may be asking, isn't the theme of this show \"the true battle comes after losing?\" And I'd answer yes little one. So it's no spoiler that some main character will lose the will to continue playing the sport. This is when it gets good, you see tensions rise between friends and teammates while that character tries to understand why she wants to fly (please it's not a spoiler when there's only 2 guys who actually do sport), what compels her. And it's these parts that make the show good.\\n\\n\r\nAnd sadly we must come back to the elephant. Throughout the series there are hints at why Masaya doesn't play the sport anymore. The main character of the show also has flashbacks about a certain boy she met in the past, yet she brushes it off and decide not to put 2 and 2 together. I believe this is what most people got angry at. However if we look at it from another perspective, these flashbacks allowed the characters reaffirm what's important to them and how to achieve their goal.\\n\\n\r\nNow let me address the romance for all the haters. How would the writers incorporate it? According to some places I've read this is Asuka's route. Now if Masaya and Asuka were to develop some romance how will Masaya as a coach be any importance to any of the other girls. But if you reply, Misaki has Shindou, I'd reply but they needed to make room for Masaya's development along with him and Asuka, where would Shindou be if they story had focused on Masaya and Asuka. That would leave Misaki unable to develop her own way of playing the sport. Anyways, Masaya doesn't play much of a role, but he's still there. Also we only know a few things about him but not so much besides the fact that he's quit the sport when he was a star as a child. What would the writers cut out so they could develop his character? Understandably the show points at this from time to time with the new neighbor and the windows incident, but that's just poor writing, as that scene wasn't useful to the story as a whole. If this was a two cour show and lacking in romance, then yes I can see an issue. But for this short one cour show, it does fine without it.\\n\\n\r\nSadly that's all the praise I can give it. The plot isn't all great. While the main characters find their reason to fight, so does Masaya. Which is totally irrelevant, along with the Sensei. A bit of an explicit spoiler here, but near the finale, the Sensei and Masaya decide to actually start trying. Thus they trained with all the athletes. And at the end, the Sensei says \"I'll tell you this super secret move\" and at the end of the series they didn't even show it, granted we don't what it is, but I assume it wasn't shown. And the shows ending brings me to another point. The main antagonist uses a technique on Asuka (please, as much as I wanted Misaki to win we all knew that it would be Asuka who wins and that is not spoiler unless you're new to anime) to which causes the match to go into overtime. The overtime allows for a short break to which Asuka decides to use the same technique on the antagonist, much to everyone's surprise, because the technique should require a lot of practice. It's because of this that I found it bad that the story ended like this, especially how Asuka got the final point.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the show is great for all the tension it provides, however it falls short with the cliche ending. While I really enjoyed it, for other reasons I won't say, I can see why people were disappoint with it. It's like getting a game that's only half complete, oh wait...\\n",

The character settings, if cliched, had plenty of unrealized potential. It is a one-cour sports anime after all, so I guess they have to shave time for the sports scenes? But then the actual matches weren't exciting either. One or the other side would do a move complete with ridiculous name and hand-waving physics explanation, and then win.

            "content": "ohhh, AoKana. it's almost impressive that an anime about a flying sport which features sideboob as a prominent part of its uniform could be this dull, but here we are. I haven't played the original game, but even so, it's painfully easy to see when something is riding on the coattails of its better executed predecessor.\r\nvague spoilers throughout, but the plot is so thoroughly guessable that I really doubt there will be any mindblowing revelations here!\r\nSTORY (4/10)\r\nso first of all, despite its eroge roots, AoKana has virtually nothing to do with romance, or even interpersonal relationships. it's basically your average sports anime with the gendersreversed: cute girls go about their daily antics and training while a couple of male side characters stand around to encourage them from the sidelines occasionally. I'm sure the intention was to give a little more insight into the girls' relationships with each other and provide a bit of eyecandy for the viewers, but the end result is an alienatingly-bland male character where most viewers were expecting a lead, and shallow interactions between the girls that are never really anything more than cute-ish.\\n\\n\r\nthe worldbuilding was lacking (which I think largely stems from this being an adaptation and the series relying on its existing fanbase being interested) but as a newcomer to AoKana, I found myself wanting to know more about pretty much everything that wasn't happening in the anime. grav shoes, 'membranes', flying circus, the side characters, the antagonists - all of them managed to be much more intriguing than the main cast.\\n\\n\r\nthat said, if you could look past the tedium of the poorly handled character interactions and the tiny amounts of actual character exposition, the long term plot was a sweet little story about the importance of enjoying yourself and taking part. which, while clich\u00e9, is at least uplifting, I guess?\\n\\n\\n\r\nART (3/10)\\n\\n\r\neck. well, they tried, at least. looking into the original game, the style is still mostly intact, with the heroines retaining their vibrant colours and cute appearances, but it just seems like the budget wasn't there. the animation is horrifically inconsistent, with entire episodes of off-model characters and decidedly wonky faces and liberal use of repeated animation, to the point where it is actually funny sometimes. some parts of the dogfight sequences are beautifully animated.. until we get a closeup of a face and the features are, well.. not where they should be.\\n\\n\r\nthe character designs are still lovely, but I'm not really sure this anime, as an adaptation, deserves credit for that.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (6/10)\\n\\n\r\nthe music was pretty solid throughout, lots of inspirational, dramatic incidental music during Flying Circus matches, the opening and ending weren't terrible, the voice acting was pretty nice. no complaints here!\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (2/10)\\n\\n\r\nfor me this is the area in which AoKana fell flat the most, which is bizarre for a series seemingly made to show off its characters. the characters start out as pretty flat archetypes, and finish up as.. really inconsistent combinations of archetypes. with the girls, charm points are picked up and dropped again at a moments' notice, Misaki in particular is a total mess of stereotypical cute anime girl traits. one moment she's a narcoleptic slacker, the next a tsundere, a jealous childhood friend, a catgirl, then the reliable older sister type, depending on what is convenient for the story at the time. the main male character had interesting backstory which was neglected in favour of Asuka inspiring everyone with her upbeat personality and everything being magically resolved that way.\\n\\n\r\nrelationships between characters popped up from nowhere, and vanished as quickly as they arrived at times. at best, the viewer might be able to look past this and take away warm fuzzy message of the importance of good sportsmanship, at worst, they might find the characters incredibly annoying.\\n\\n\r\nthe antagonists and side characters were probably the most interesting, and I did enjoy what little exposition they got, for what that's worth!\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT (3/10)\\n\\n\r\nthe further I got through this series, the more I realised that this is just an optional extra to the original game. it provides nothing that new and interesting, and it's not an exact remake of the game either, which leaves me thinking: who was this made for anyway? I can't really see fans of the original being too enamoured with the anime as it lacks so much, and I'm not entirely convinced that it'll be memorable enough to net any new fans.. it did get me a little interested in the manga and game to see if the subject matter is handled any better there, however.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL (3/10)\\n\\n\r\nI think, even objectively, AoKana was super ok. someone might enjoy it as a way to kill a few hours, and for the spectacle of the FC matches, but nothing more. subjectively, I really didn't like it. it felt like a halfhearted attempt to put out more content and nothing more, with utterly lazy characterisation to boot.\\n\\n\r\ngive it a go if you like stuff that screams 'just go play the original game!'\\n",

The protagonist is replaced by the heroines in the situations/flags/gags, so the heroines can show up their evolution as a team and friends, no so bad but this happens all the way until the end.\\n\\n\r\n>Second bad point is the result of the first, the supposed protagonist is now a super shadow support character, and a very useless one, but losing him means more than a lack of 1 character; this broke some of the bridges of the story to grow and feel the plot itself, so at the end, we didn't have a real end and less the true end, that could have given the anime a second season.\\n\\n\r\n>Third and last, real situations/flags/gags changed by Fan Service.\\n\\n\r\nMy recommendation, if you don't have nothing to see or maybe you want something to distract you, this could help.

            "content": "Before I begin, the genres it contain were wrong.  But other than the misleading genre titles, I personally found it quite enjoyable.\r\nNote that this show was based on a VN (Visual Novel) by Sprite.  So there will be some VN cliches.\r\nStory.  For many who takes anime seriously and always seeks a plot, then you will be disappointed.  Mainly, it was non-existent.  I guess the best way to put it was similar to Fee!. Not much plot, just characters doing sports.  Also, it's a sport that doesn't exist in real life.  So no one can remotely relate to it.And I feel it could have done much better if they developed the story more.  But, it's probably one of those VN animes for advertising.  \\n\\n\r\nArt. Brilliant.  Not gonna say much but it does its job very well.\\n\\n\r\nSound.  I'm a fan of anime osts (Original Soundtracks) in general.  And let me tell you, I've been trying to find this anime's ost since like episode 7.  I just love the cheery-ness and the light-heartedness of these osts.   And again I've a feeling the ost were from the actual VN itself.  And generally, VN have great osts.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters.  Despite its relatively poor plot, the characters were quite memorable.  The bubbly one, the sleepy-cat one, the obsessive one, and the quiet one.  They're all there and it kinda deviates from your usual characters because they fulfil their role very well.  They all have their little quirks and gags.  Again, it follows the tradition of a typical VN.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment.  I personally enjoyed this show quite a lot. It's those shows were you watch for fun only.  No thinking involved, suspension of disbelief and accept the show as it is.  These are elements required to maximize enjoyment out of this show.\\n\r\nNo thinking, well it's a comedy.  Suspension of disbelief, it's a Sci-fi anime about a non-existing sport.  (And you WILL be very confused most of the time, but I think it will be worth it).  Accept the show as it is.  Remember that it's only 12 episodes, about a non-existing sport.  So it will be IMPOSSIBLE to fill everyone's image of this show, and perfect it.  Even Angel Beats, deemed as Angel Feels, couldn't develop all its characters in 12 episodes (excluding the extra episodes).  So don't expect that will happen in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, as much as i would like to give it more than 7, it doesn't deserve more than 8.  Max, 7.9 .  Pacing and plot were the main downfalls of this. But I kinda expected it after the first episode.  BUT, please, if you have dropped this show, I do encourage you to finish it off.  Yes, there will always be that one annoying character in every anime (this is no exception), but you will be satisfied with what you've watched.\\n\r\nAnd for those who are thinking of binging this/starting this.  Don't think too deep into it, and don't over-hype it like what I did.  \\n\\n\r\nFinally, there's NO romance involved, just so you know.  Unless you count the love and passion for this sport.  VNs generally are romance stories, so I guess that's why romance was thrown into the genres.",

If you were looking for a \"romance\", it's not here. Although I feel like I could have fit it in, the new ideas and concepts make up for it.\r\nThe story follows a group of high school students that participate in FC, or Flying Circus. The players, using anti-gravity boots, race each other to these buoys or try to tag the other players back. Pretty simple, but also pretty creative.\r\nNow,the characters were very lackluster. Most of the time they were way too predictable, or they were so far off from their characters you would just sit there and think, \"Who's idea was this?\"\\n\\n\r\nEven though I've been giving this anime a pretty hard time, it was still fun to watch, and that is the only reason I gave this anime a 7 instead of a 5.

            "content": "Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythm is actually a \u2018sports\u2019 anime, or I consider it to be. It follows the main protagonist as she discovers how amazing and fun the sport, Flying Circus, was. Flying Circus is a sport about flying fast and hitting the back of the enemy to point. Its very intriguing and definitely interesting. The sport itself attracted me, that\u2019s why I got into this series. The story follows like any other typical slice-of-life sports anime. Still, it was enjoyable. I do admit, there were some pacing issues on some episodes in the middle part of the series. There were some episodesthat I felt were unnecessary or were too slow. The rest then were okay.\\n\\n\r\nOther than the sport, the characters also made me like the series. All of the characters were really likeable. I didn\u2019t find anyone annoying, though I\u2019m a bit hassled by the male lead. Other than that, I like them all. The main protagonist, Asuka, looks and act like any other \u2018baka\u2019 protagonist, but damn she is so badass during the games. I really like her determination to win and also her love for the sport. I also like Misaki for being an awesome player and a really good friend to Asuka.\\n\\n\r\nI really like the character designs, specifically the uniform of the characters when they play Flying Circus. As you can see in the cover photo, they look like birds and the shoes looks so cool. It makes me want to own one. With the animation, well, there is 3D. Yeah, I admit, some scenes were were not really good, especially during the fights, but they were bearable compared to the new Berserk. So its not that bad.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is quite lighthearted and fun to watch. This anime might not be the best underrated anime out there, its still enjoyable to watch. I recommend you guys to binge-watch this one. I think one of the reasons people overlooked this one was because its kinda forgettable, especially when she went against Assassination Classroom S2, Akagami Shirayukihime S2, and the famous Erased in the Winter season. Binge it, its worth it bruh.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, thats it for now.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading and I hope you check out this gem!!",

            "content": "When I first read the description for the show I thought, \"Great, here's another harem where the underdog guy will suddenly sweep everyone off their feet.\" Surprisingly, this show isn't really like that at all, it's more about the fruition of a girl's lifelong dream to be able to fly and compete with the other best flyers in the area. Though the show showed promise early on with some good development, the circus's act breaks up late in the show, falling victim to forced, unnatural antagonists. If you're looking for a harem, this definitely is not one. If you're looking for a competitive, tournament-based showthat bastardizes moves from air combat, then feel free to dig in.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nThe show is well drawn overall with a rather bright mood and lots of serene, blue skies and oceans. Backgrounds in general are mixed as occasionally you get really detailed drawings (mostly clouds) and other times you get generic, blurred scenery. There is definitely a lot of CGI in this show, some of which is pretty distracting. The show has some nice, colorful UI displays during tournaments and some other gadgetry that looks like it's lifted right out of a game. The character styling is average overall; you won't get characters confused with each other but there isn't anything particularly special about them either. Asuka's drawing style feels a bit odd as her eyes seem to give off an air of confidence and sharpness that honestly is missing most of the time. I also don't get the uniforms worn during matches, not really sure why yukata-like sleeves are helpful in a speed contest.\\n\\n\r\nExpect a fair, though dispersed, amount of action, centered around the two main tournaments in the show. I was indeed surprised that they made it through two tournaments considering how most shows of late fail to conclude even a single one per season. The action consists of two contestants flying and attempting to accomplish goals, either hitting pylons or hitting the other contestant's back, which apparently causes a giant magic-sign-like symbol to appear. Given that most of the action is really just following colorful contrails in the sky, this isn't going to be satisfying for those needing real, gritty action. The same can be said in the ecchi department. Though there are completely unnecessary scenes, such as our protagonist seeing his neighbor pretty much naked multiple times, it isn't nearly as over the top as some of the other ecchi heavy hitters. That said, there is plenty of bouncy and bodysuits in the show if that's your fancy.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe show opens with a very light rock OP that reminds me a bit of the voicing in Mami Kawada's work in Shakugan no Shana, the melody here isn't nearly as strong though. The ED is likewise very light (almost like they purposely filtered out all the base); I like the instrumentation and atmospheric pads, but the melody just isn't convincing. The same could be said about the BGM, it has some good fundamentals and some nice string tracks but ultimately lacks any memorable melodies; the stringed instruments make for a fairly relaxed mood overall.\\n\\n\r\nThe show has a decent number of veterans but the actual casting feels odd. Misato Fukuen (Yami from ToLoveRu) is an interesting choice for a clumsy, light-hearted heroine and Azumi Asakura (Asia from DxD and Kumin from Chuunibyou) is an odd choice for an own-pace tsundere. Really, my choice for strongest performance goes to Risa Taneda, who voices a strong supporting character.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThe show follows yet another high school club, this time the Flying Circus club where you train to fly in circles in what is essentially something like a baseball diamond. Our protagonist, Hinata, is coerced into joining the dying Kurahama club along with the heroines of the show. What follows is a lot of preparation and, surprisingly, multiple tournaments. It's all told in a rather simple, contiguous storyline with just a few teasing flashbacks.\\n\\n\r\nThough I appreciated the effort in drawing out this unlikely setting and liked the intensity during the tournaments, the rest of the show felt rather lackluster. Though episodes flow well together, many of them focus on a specific heroine and their personal struggle; often the protagonist isn't even part of the resolution. As alluded to before, the show builds to two main peaks in the form of the tournaments. Each is resolved to a fair degree (the latter in the final end credits) though I still don't get the point of the whole show. There were a lot of what seem to be foreshadows that don't amount to anything; either Gonzo planned a sequel or are using them to satisfy those who consumed the original source material- in either case these events are just wasted screen time for the rest of us for now.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThere are a fair number of characters in this show, including about half of dozen rather important females. The character interactions were pretty good overall, but one wonders why they even put the protagonist here. It becomes obviously pretty early in the show that he's no ordinary Joe, but he really never gets much of a chance to shine nor does he really try for the majority of the show. Other than seeing his neighbor undress a few times, there's nothing guyish about our lead.\\n\\n\r\nThe heroines fare better than our protagonist but likewise aren't particularly memorable. There's just too many of them and none of them really ever develops any real bonds with the protagonist, the strongest bond is arguably between two of the girls. Reiko Satouin gets my vote for most interesting character, which says a lot considering that she's not even a main character. As for the lead heroine, Asuka, there's just something about her that's off. Sometimes she's goofy and sometimes she's Kira Yamato; it just boggles me how a single person can be such a klutz and yet such a genius.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, a character-centric slice of life is pretty meaningless without strong characters, and that's exactly what we have here.\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nThis show is about a useless bystander of a male lead who barks orders at various girls flying in circles who eventually develop some feelings for the guy barking orders at them but nothing ever develops- there is no romance. In addition, there's some amusing tournaments where it apparently makes sense that the best way to intercept a flying object is to stand still- there is no logic.\\n\\n\r\nSo there you have it, a VN-converted show with no romance and illogical battles. If you're looking for a show with good character development or intense action, steer clear. This is really only a filler show to pick up when you've really run out of things to pick up. That said, it isn't the worst of fillers that I've seen. Are you ready to run in circles figuring out what this show is really about?",

This anime has the feeling of some other anime there they just rush through the entire show saying this is that person and here you go not much more. As i have stated many times already i feel like this anime was made to leave you hanging on all threads if the reason for this anime to be this plain and uninspiring was because it originally had a good story in the manga or novel then its ok but if this is basically because someone found this story good i cant see it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall the consept is the  only thing that did it for me and some music other than that there is really nothing speciall about this anime and your better watching a harem anime like infinite Stratos there something happens in a more good pace eventhough i know even that has some rushed pointers in it.  Dont watch this if you have another anime on hold i advice you to watch that and pray you never have to feel the same dissapointment and unfulfilling thoughts that i had.

            "content": "True battle comes after losing.\r\nYes, from the anime's premise, this anime is a somewhat hybrid of slice of life and sports anime but with it's FC sports elements being the major focus to it. The slice of life at best gives some \"ok-running gag\" comedy to some character development sections for the character in question and the developments to most of the characters are handled \"ok\", though some are rushed as they only get one episode to their name then tag along with the competition as spectators. The FC sport as simple as it is, it is rather interesting to watch and gives some formof adrenaline to it, be it because of the simplistic nature or how animated it is, FC is the main reason LA watched the series all the way through. Because it's also a pseudo-sports anime it also falls under many of the typical sports cliches, but for what this anime does...as cliched as it is, it's still fun nonetheless as it's does help with the characters development. \\n\\n\r\nWith the characters they are typical visual novel stereotypes with their own quirks just with the added sports added to it. One of the club members Misaki Tobisawa voiced by ''Azumi Asakura'' have a cat accent every time she talks and she gets huge amount of development outside from being the cat sleeper character, Mashiro Arisaka voiced by ''Nozomi Yamamoto'' is the yuri girl in love with Misaki and later her development focuses on her inferiority complex towards the better FC'er, Asuka Kurashina voiced by ''Misato Fukuen'' is probably the only character in the anime to not change her behaviour, instead her stride to grow as a FC'er becomes a pedestal to the rest of the characters. Finally the only male Masaya Hinata voiced by ''Ryota Osaka'' about his reluctance to join the club in the first place though he knows the sport a lot. The characters get developed in the episodic arc sense along with growing the club simultaneously and that works in this anime's favour.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation, well hello Gonzo, your not slacking this time. Yes, the animation throughout is decent enough and although CGI is used during the high-speed moments of the FC, it's not distracting in the sense as the FC battle is animated well overall to be ignored, not to mention the contrails and the overall FC battles are the best parts of the series. Overall Gonzo once again steps it up with the animation even when they use CGI!\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of voice acting, LA would have to say that there are some squeakers, that being ''Nozomi Yamamoto'' and ''Misato Fukuen'' however LA can once again ignore that as LA's favorite character would go to Asuka Kurashina (her genkiness is rather infectious with Misato's vocals).\\n\\n\r\nThe ending did make the build up and the \"final battle\" itself along with the intensity of the battle and the overall theme in which this anime was trying to portray (even though it's slightly cliched) to \"just have fun\" instead of worrying about winning all the more prevalent...huh that statement LA said at the start of review kinda went full circle now.\\n\\n\r\nAo no Kanata no Four Rhythm may not be a hidden gem or a prominently \"great\" anime of Winter 2016, it definitely has a certain charm to it from it's quirky characters to it's love and enthusiasm of FC and flying through it's characters and thus LA will say that it's not a hidden gem or the \"best\" anime of Winter 2016...it's average-above average at best.",

            "content": "Have you ever wanted to be able to fly, not by planes, but by a certain kind of shoes? With those kind of conditions, have you ever wondered what it would be like if there was a sport that you only play in the sky? I'm sure a sport like that would be quite enjoyable, especially in this anime. The only reason for me watching it is the artwork, which I thought was very beautiful, but honestly, I didn't expect too much. Needless to say, the moment I planned to include Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythm, or Aokana for short, among the anime Iwatched for the winter 2016 season, I had gotten myself in for a pleasant surprise.\\n\\n\r\nAo no Kanata no Four Rhythm introduces to us the sport of Flying Circus, or FC for short. Grav-Shoes, which are used to fly for transportation, are also used in this sport. Touch either your opponent's back or one of the four buoys that float above the ocean, and you score a point. This anime focuses on Asuka Kurashina, a girl who is completely new to flying but quickly falls in love with FC. She, along with Misaki Tobisawa and Mashiro Arisaka, joins her school's FC Club and, coached by Masaya Hinata, competes in various FC matches.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Ao no Kanata was quite an interesting one, and I was fully invested in the FC matches that took place within this anime. There are also a decent number of interesting characters that got a decent amount of development throughout the story, like Asuka and Misaki; those two are my favorite characters, to be honest. There is a problem I have involving the characters, though; there are a number of them I personally thought didn't appear as often as they could of. For example, Masaya was the protagonist of the visual novel, but in the anime, he doesn't appear so much; even when he does, he doesn't have much significance. Instead, the protagonist torch seems to have been passed on to Asuka, and as much as I love Asuka, I would have loved to see more of Masaya.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending themes, \"Contrail ~Kiseki~\" by Mami Kawada and \"a-gain\" by Ray, were actually pretty good songs, and I'm surprised by how much they fit the anime. The voice acting was pretty good, too; Misato Fukuen as Asuka was just so freaking adorable! However, we can't forget about the best part about this anime, which is, hands down, the animation. The animation is colorful and bright, and it's cool this way. The animation especially stands out in the FC matches; it had a great use of 3D animation during those matches.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythm was a good anime. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to see a great sports anime for a sport that isn't even real. Who knows, though? Maybe several years for now, we may have the technology to make Grav-Shoes into real shoes and Flying Circus into a real sport! (At least, that's a nice thought I'd like to have.)",

            "content": "AOKANA: Four Rhythm Across the Blue is one of these series with each season of shows that doesn't stand out that much, and for a good reason.\r\nThe story itself is not that interesting. It's your typical \"a group of kids join a once defunct sports club that gets resurgence thanks to these new members\". I do find the sport (as well as the wear used for it) to be a bit fascinating, though the lackluster story can still make it look dull. Plus, these are never explained enough (like how did they come to be, what was the purpose, etc.) At times, I wondered ifthere was an actual story, or even if there was one (that was surprisingly absent) that was never used. Upon further research, the visual novel, which the anime was based on, was more of a dating sim (any signs of romantic elements were taken out).\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are just was dull as the story. They're your cardboard cutouts, two-dimensional with nothing interesting about them. One of the characters had traits that did not match at all; while acting like the more adult character, occasionally she has this cat speech (ending sentences with \"Nya\" and whatnot). In the visual novel, you play as the one who (sort of) becomes the main male lead in the anime, and choose which os the girls to have a romantic relationship with. He showed no significance in this anime, and doesn't even have any type of romance, which could've given the show some spice. There's implication that he has a past, but that's not even brushed on (just mentioned). The only thing I can say I liked was the voice of the main female lead (just the voice, nothing else) as I found to be quite cute.\\n\\n\r\nJust like with everything else with the show, there's not much to say about the animation. For the most part, it's average with occasional inconsistencies in detail.\\n\\n\r\nAs I continued watching, it came to a point where I wasn't looking forward to next week. There really was nothing to this that completely captured my attention. I understand why the story from the original source was changed for the anime format, but even a bit of romance can give it at least something, especially for character development. I would not recommend this to anyone.",

            "content": "-Gogoanime.io: \"This is a love story about the two who met while soaring in the skies, and the friends surrounding them.\"-\r\nTo be honest here guys, I watched this anime because I was told that it was \"romance\" but not once in the show, not even a tiny bit did it show any kind or hint of romance. I am so disappointed to the show's story. Apparently, the protagonist is supposed to be a guy named Masaya, but instead of revolving the story around him and again instead of showing how he showed his romantic interest in any of the girls he's been with, the storyrevolved around a girl named Asuka, which is totally messed up because the main-main character is supposed to be Masaya.\\n\\n\r\nDisappointing as it may be, the anime's art quality is perfect, scene execution is nice and character's personality is good. The story is just really a big disappointment for me, not just because it had no romance in it but it had a \"mainstream\" kind of feel. It was too simple and didn't have something I'd call great. Again, greatly disappointed with the \"No Romance\" part.\\n\\n\r\nI hope they create a sequel, movie, or an ova to this anime and hope it contains what it's supposed to have because the potential of the anime's plot is actually pretty good but it's not being used to its fullest. Not just talking about its romance potential but also to its potential to be an overall, great anime. This might also be the best one if plot was utilized properly.",

I'm actually a fan of Air Gear so the concept \"flying\" really got me hooked into this anime and I got loads of free time so I'm like why not and decided to try it.\r\n :Story: 6\r\nAn anime whichhad friendships/sports and a little spice of drama and poof Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythm is created. Basically its about a girl named Asuka Kurashima who came back to the island where she went before as a child and somehow is a prodigy in this \"Flying Circus\" thing. There's also the \"kouhai\" character which is played by Arisaka Mashiro. Tobisawa Misaki played the senpai role between this two, shes a gluttonous girl who have fragile emotions and basically had many emotional breakdowns through out the serie. And there's the main \"guy\" character named Hinata Masaya who is actually a prodigy and also a japan candidate back then but hes a p*ssy so he ran away from everything and because he got caught up in the moment he became a \"second\" to all the players in the FC Club.\\n\\n\r\nIt had it cliche moments aswell like the main character being prodigy and good at sport even though she tried it just recently, and many more. The ending was also predictable at many ways the cliche lines of the antagonists such as \"why does she look like shes having fun\" and so forth brought predictable ending to the serie.\\n\\n\r\n:Art:  8 \\n\\n\r\nIts the modern generation and I must say that the art of this anime is top notch and its one of the reasons why I didnt drop this anime, I've been wanting to drop it so much after so many disappointments here and there such as lack of explaination and sh*t pacing that was brought throughout the serie.\\n\\n\r\n:Sound: 7\\n\\n\r\nThe osts were alright but it could be better, something like that was given off as I keep hearing the osts from openings and endings as I am the type of person to not skip the opening, as there are some people who actually skip openings from time to time. I as a fan of music myself refrains from skipping as I actually enjoy listening to op/ed's.\\n\\n\r\n:Character/Character Development: 5\\n\\n\r\nCharacters were mostly all basic looking you have the normal girls with normal sized tits, theres that flat chested, loli, kouhai girl, the hot looking teacher, proud type girls with boobs ( Satouin) and the main char guy who I really is so dissappointed in is plain looking and nothing out of the normal presented except his exceptional skills in FC which took him 10 f*ckin episodes to release to them that he had those techniques. He's like \"o sh*t they need new moves and crap alright imma show off my techniques\" and the teacher aswell LMFAO she couldve helped by showing her techniques even at the first half of the serie but nah which is really a disappointment.\\n\\n\r\nI was really disappointed in the character development through out this serie as there are many flaws that couldve been fixed easily things such as it took 10 episodes for \"Hinata Masaya\" for him to stop being a p*ssy and actually teach FC manually LOL\\n\\n\r\n:Enjoyment: 5\\n\r\nI hardly enjoyed watching this to be honest because I keep waiting for the part where the main guy will take control of the situation and actually have some balls and be proud of his exceptional skills and take pride in it but nah he chose to be a p*ssy until ep 10 which is really a disappointment.\\n\\n\r\n:Overall: 6\\n\r\nWell it was out of the usual animes and it truly is a unique one even though I've had many disappointments throughout this serie it was fairly good and if youre looking for a pure sports anime with a bunch of emotional breakdowns this is for you.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "So I have just finished watching this and I think I'll be giving a (not so) short review\r\nWell, the point is that this anime had wasted a lot of potential\r\nAt first when I watched this, I found it to be interesting since this anime focus around a new type of sport, so I at least expected it to share the same thrill of what a sport anime should be\r\nBut in the end, I was dissapointed\r\nAt first I rated this 8, but as I watch it, the disappointment led me towards lowering it to 6\r\nWell, there are pros and cons, so I'll be discussing about thepros first\\n\\n\r\n-it is a brand new sport\\n\r\nWhat piqued my interest is this, since we always wanted something to be fresh and not mainstream, and aokana is one of them\\n\r\n-decent raphics\\n\r\nThe graphic in this one is still acceptable, it isn't one of those that really has a bad or weird grapnics. And since it centers around the competition of the sports, I would expect the graphic to be at least intriguing to watch and yes, I could say it did\\n\r\n-flow is more relaxing\\n\r\nBecause the story is not too serious and tense, we wouldn't need to be too focused on the story since it flows quite relaxing, hence making it more enjoyable so plus point to this\\n\r\n-fun\\n\r\nWell, okay I could say that aokana focuses more on fun, so... yeah\\n\r\n-characters are clear\\n\r\nThe character development is acceptable, it doesn't have too many characters that would make us really confused and it focuses more on the main characters, but it does lack a bit of the characters backstory.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the cons\\n\r\n-the competitions are a bit boring\\n\r\nDespite from being something fresh, the competition doesn't really have much variation, thus making it a bit boring for me. Of course this is to be expected as it not a common sport, but I thought it could have a bit more variation\\n\r\nThe most intriguing one I found is only at episode 12 and yeah, the last episode\\n\r\n-Story development\\n\r\naokana is weak at the phase of the story. Every phase of sports is crucial, by this I mean that from the introduction of the sports, the practice, the competition, until the win or loss, everything.\\n\r\nThe introduction of the sports didn't have any problems. What I felt missing is from the practice until the result of the competition. It didn't pack a punch\\n\r\n-an imbalanced character\\n\r\nThis imo is one of the most weakest point in aokana and the biggest factor to why I rate low\\n\r\nAs everybody knows, Asuka is the character that has the most spotlight, in fact, aokana prioritize her too much. And to add it, Asuka is too OP, it felt like the most important thing is talent, not hardwork. She could easily do anything, I mean anything any other people could do.\\n\r\nThis kind of talent itself is not that bad of a plot, but for it to be over exploited leaves a bad outcome.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, aokana does have many flaws, but is still enjoyable to watch\\n\r\nIt is more of a leisure anime than a serious one and is better to watch if you are just intrigued and isn't really expecting much\\n\\n\r\nI really wished it to give more spotlight to Masaya though, and in a certain episode (no spoilers intended) did gave my hopes up, but....\\n\r\nWell, nope",

While I do have some issues with Misaki, I did enjoy her the most out of the girls, and thought her drama was (sort of) realistic.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nNegatives:\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nFirst issue is the handling of Hinata Masaya as a whole, and this is probably my biggest issue. The show makes somewhat of a big deal over the fact he played FC before and implies he and Aoi have history together. But the problem is we barely get any look into his past, and any time the show has the chance to explore him, it just makes a few side comments and then shifts back to the girls for the rest of the episode or even episodes. Then when Misaki goes through her drama, the show suddenly acts as if he's getting over his past by him saying pretty much FC is hard to run from, even though we have not really seen any character development from him to make that deserved. This also ties into him playing with Grav-Shoes out of nowhere, it wasn't earned and was very forced. Another problem the show has, is his overall...lack of presence. Although it tries to push him as mattering, he doesn't really have much interactions with his friends nor do they seem to really care about him and comes off borderline non-existent often enough when it comes to them (besides to a tiny degree Misaki). He also has no believable bonds with any of the characters. On top of that, he doesn't get to do much other than give orders usually (rarely do we get to see him do anything else), further making him seem isolated in the show. Bottom line is, Masaya was severly underutilized, and he should have been handled better and had a lot more screentime as well as delve more into his past. \\n\\n\r\nUp next is...unfortunately Misaki. The issue with her, is her character is all over the place. Here's a prime example. We see that she is very competitive and prideful, right? But when she can't handle that Asuka is doing better than her against Shindou and isn't the best on her team like she thought, unlike the other times, she just keeps quiet and merely grunts. This is very inconsistent with how she's known to act when she's very frustrated and annoyed, and is pretty out of character for her. Another inconsistency with her is she flip flops when it comes to Mashiro. At first she seemed totally okay with Mashiro's affections, and then suddenly she's not anymore. No reason, it just happens. Another problem, her attitude when it comes to Mashiro is so nonchalant to a point they really should have developed her character to caring more about Mashiro. It never feels like she truly cares about her. Even when it really mattered in ep 4 when Mashiro is down, Misaki does nothing, not even so much as ask what's the matter, she just goes about her business like nothing is wrong. Yet Misaki acts all caring about Asuka when she has any problem, and is actually nice to her. The contrast is painfully obvious, and it makes Misaki unlikable when it comes to Mashiro. Another thing, how did she even know Masaya played FC in ep 6? Like many things, no explanation. It's also pretty annoying that Masaya opened up about himself to Misaki in ep 8, and she barely has a reaction to anything he says. Overall though, she's not written very well, is all over the place, and, like Masaya, should have been handled a lot better. \\n\\n\r\nNow for Mashiro, why exactly was she in the main cast? I know she is an FC player, but she didn't contribute to anything, and the writers don't even show her matches from start to end and skip around them. Let's think about it. Masaya gives advice, coaches them, Asuka and Misaki are fairly strong and can build off one another, what does Mashiro offer? They make it seem like she's so important given she had nearly a whole episode dedicated to her, but that goes nowhere. She realized she had more knack for speed, but then we get to the first tournament, nothing payed off for her, she got immediately owned like it was nothing, and then the show has the characters clap as if she did something impressive when she didn't. She got one lucky point cause Satou was thrown off by her speed (whom did not know she was a Speeder at first), and then after one more point to a buoy, she got whooped the moment Satou quit playing around. Couldn't you start Mashiro with a weaker opponent? I mean why give her an episode trying to make her a Speeder, and then trash her aside in the very first match next episode that she is in? The whole thing was pointless and a waste of time. Worst of all, is her irrational actions in ep 4 that made no sense. She lonewolfs without once telling Masaya (her FC coach) about her issue or ask him for help like she should have. They give no reason either for why she won't go to him for help either. Then she lets a girl she barely even knows from another school teach her when that is Masaya's job, nor is it Rika's place to be the one teaching her. They could have just said something like Mashiro doesn't want to burden Masaya with her troubles, and that would have partly fixed it, but they lost that excuse when they've got Rika not even one time point out to Mashiro that she should be going to Masaya for help and question why she's not doing so. It just feels like an excuse to not utilize Masaya really, and it's terribly written as I said. Then there's how she seriously believed Rika's claim in ep 3 that Masaya saw her undress despite not knowing Rika at all back then, and makes no attempts to defend her friend over this random girl making a claim with no evidence. As if that's not stupid enough, she then gets on his case later in the same episode for simply staring at Misaki like a normal person would, when she herself just tried to invade Misaki's space. Finally, her comic relief role. She's supposed to be one of the more important characters, but the show doesn't use her properly because it's treating her like a side character who's just mainly there for comedy while Asuka and Misaki kinda hog the spotlights. We have Shion, whom can easily fill the comedy role after all. Mashiro is one of the more main characters, but she doesn't offer anything to the show as far as being useful. The only thing she tends to be is comic relief with her Misaki obsession, which of course they don't even try to explore why she cares about Misaki at all, when she has more reason to not. Aside from that, Mashiro contributes nothing, she's simply there for the sake of being there. You could completely remove her and the show would go on like normal.\\n\\n\r\nAoi I don't have many problems with how she's handled compared to the others, but there's still a few things that I take issue with. The main one, is her being a drama queen about Irina's FC and mocking it outright. First off, do you really think everyone is going to start playing the way Saki does? So what if she keeps winning tournaments? Not everyone wants to stall games cause to them it would be boring and they just want to win, so Aoi's \"FC would meet it's end as a sport\" claim was pretty weak. Some would play like Saki, some wouldn't. Also, Aoi's whole goes against the spirit of the game nonsense...it is a sport you can play however you want so long as no cheating. Saki does not cheat, nor is she doing anything wrong to anyone. They do play different, so what, get over it and come up with new strategies instead of antagonizing their FC. It was really bad drama that shouldn't have been a thing. And listening to her arguments is cringe worthy as well given Saki does still get points, so she is still playing like everyone else, just she does it differently, which she has a right to do, as does anyone. And at the end, Aoi doesn't even apologize for the way she's been acting about their FC, she only acknowledged their FC because it caused the sport to evolve. Also, does this girl not know how to leave people alone about their past? I mean she of all people should know that Masaya wouldn't want to think about it, yet she keeps bringing it up at some points with no real consideration for his feelings about it. Also, like Masaya, the show tries to set her up as being more important, but fails to follow through with it.\\n\\n\r\nNext is Asuka. Of all the girls in the main cast, she's the least interesting character. She's a one-note airhead whom loves FC so much. That's pretty much her entire character, but that's the least of my problems with her. Now I do understand she is the main character, but I still think she was given far too much screentime to a point it hurt everyone else. In the times where the show quits focusing on her, it almost all goes to Misaki while barely giving any of the other characters screentime they need. This hinders the cast from being used properly, because all the focus is usually just on Asuka or Misaki. And it's true they are the lead characters of the show, but the rest of the main cast suffers from the show focusing too much on these two and not using the other characters as much as they should be. One major problem with Asuka, is how she is written when it comes to Masaya. She is told in ep 2 how he has played FC before. Knowing Asuka, she would have been very intrigued/excited by and wanted to talk to him after that piece of information was said. Instead she does nothing, which makes no sense when you factor how much she loves FC and wanted him to be her coach. But then she is told for a second time basically in ep 6 by Misaki that he has played FC by saying how Aoi was his FC teacher, and she still does nothing. Again, that's pretty ooc of her when you consider her overall character. Another problem is she goes from being an amateur to shortly after able to make Shindou, a very experienced FC player, go all out on her. The Air Kick Turn you can chalk to beginner's luck, but she shouldn't have went from nothing at all to being almost on par with Shindou after maybe a few weeks at best of basic training. That's pretty dumb when you think about it. It'd be different if she already had a good degree of FC experience, but she literally just learned what FC even was weeks ago. Asuka's big drama after losing to Saki was horrendous. It made no sense for her to mope around most of an episode just because she couldn't fight the Birdcage tactic. And what really makes it so much worse, is she's totally ooc. Asuka would have simply perked up and vowed to get stronger, that's the kind of person she is known to be, as we see in her match against Misaki in ep 2 where she didn't stay down for more than a few seconds. Yet here she is moping for most of an episode over one lousy loss? It was terribly forced drama that shouldn't have happened. I also think Asuka really has no depth as a character. They try to explore her past a little, but we have no context on what caused Asuka to view herself the way she did. Yeah she says what she is depressed about, but that doesn't explain what she went through that lead to her thinking of herself as she describes. It is fun to watch her in some FC matches, but I don't find her that good, is written terribly when it comes to Masaya, and wish they would have used her better, and toned down her screentime so we can get more development with the other characters.\\n\\n\r\nShion and Madoka, well they're not written bad per-say, but I do wish they left Shion for the comic relief while toning down Mashiro's. They don't both need to fill that role often enough after all. Madoka could have been more explored given she doesn't seem all that into FC, yet she stuck around for some reason. She is the manager of the club, but it seemed pretty questionable why she even stuck around the club when it didn't seem like she was all that into FC. I also don't understand why she stood there and said nothing when Aoi told Masaya he should be able to get how Misaki feels (ep 8). She was right next to him, so clearly she heard it, but she has no reaction for some reason when you would expect her to be curious what Aoi meant by that. Still, she and Shion are okay.\\n\\n\r\nRika...why she is listed as a main character is beyond me. She does not do much other than help Mashiro one time (which I have a problem with). Aside from helping Mashiro once, Rika is kinda irrelevant overall. She's pretty much a support character who just comes back sometimes to play a match and definitely shouldn't be listed as a main character. She's no different than Shindou and Satou helping out on occasion. As for her as a character...well she's nice and plays FC seriously, which isn't much to say about her character. She's not the least bit interesting, and the whole mad at Masaya for seeing her undress was so cringy, like close your own curtains for crying out loud. Plus that little sub plot amounted to nothing, they didn't even talk to each other to fix it, Rika just has one of his friends tell him she forgave him. As a whole, I didn't care for her.\\n\\n\r\nShindou would be so much better if he wasn't so boring of a character. He lacks any personality, but randomly roars furiously and gets hardcore serious when pushed to his limit.\\n\\n\r\nSatou I won't deny was pretty entertaining, but there's not much to be said for her besides her having a proud personality and her whole food thing.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nSaki, the best way to describe this character is she has hardly a shred of emotion up until ep 11. Basically, she is the most boring character in this entire series. On top of that, we don't really dive in her head to see what she really thinks of how Irina is going about things. So we don't get a sense of how she feels and if she's simply doing as Irina says because she wants to make her happy, or if she's on board with it. We know she likes cats, and we know she is friends with Irina, but that's still not much to say about her. And for the big final boss, that's pretty sad.\\n\\n\r\nIrina is the worst character in this show by far. She views the current FC as a cheap circus imitation...the sport is called Flying Circus, aka a sport simply for fun, so her reasoning for hating the current FC is stupid and nonsensical. Second, the way she goes about trying to get respect from people makes no sense. Who the heck would respect someone who's acting like a cocky little snot and goes out of their way to another school to try embarrassing their best player simply just to show off the Birdcage? I will give the show credit for giving a brief glimpse of her friendship with Saki in that one flashback, but Irina as a whole is an awful character who also had no reason to be an antagonist. She took a show that was not written well already, and made it a lot worse with all the terrible drama and how stupid and unlikable of a character she is. I would have preferred she wasn't put in the show, or at least her character was a little more likable.\\n\\n\r\nFor other story things I can bring up, Masaya joining the club was too forced. He had no interest in the sport anymore, and just helped Asuka two times just to be nice (second one Aoi manipulated the situation to make him do it, which was insensitive on her part given she knows he wants no part of it). Yet he joins just because they ask him to? The show made it very clear he doesn't want any part of FC, and out of nowhere with no reasoning on his part, he just joins? How does that make any sense? Speaking of this scene, his friends were pretty insensitive. He already brought up earlier he played FC before, yet here he is STILL hesitant to join the club at the end of the episode. How does it not register to these idiots that something is clearly wrong, or even bother to ask him why he doesn't want to join? The thing that grinds my gears even more is the way Asuka is portrayed. She's a kind hearted person who cares about how people feel, yet she's acting totally ooc by doing nothing but beg Masaya to coach her despite knowing already he doesn't want to join. \\n\\n\r\nThe kid Masaya stuff in regards to Asuka and Misaki was pointless, because it never went anywhere at all. What was the point of him being in the Asuka flashback and be who Misaki beat as a kid if neither of these two girls are going to figure any of this out? It literally went nowhere and felt thrown in for nothing. Plus you would think Asuka with her memory would be able to see it's obviously Masaya given she remembers exactly what the kid looks like. It's not hard to figure out that Masaya is that same kid-it's the same freaking face, eyes and hair! I understood in Misaki's case not figuring it out given her memory didn't seem as clear as Asuka's, but with Asuka it was pretty inexcusable no matter how you slice it. It's a subplot that is just left hanging.\\n\\n\r\nIn ep 2 early in, Masaya cuts Madoka off from asking him to join by refusing, and the scene becomes tension-like with her and Asuka clearly able to tell something is up. Then the very next scene is all the girls simply together at lunch. I'm sorry...what!? Let me get this straight, you ignored everything that just happened like it never even happened despite making it seem like a big deal! You don't even have Asuka or Madoka one time ponder why he was acting off, when they clearly have the common sense to tell he was acting strange! \\n\\n\r\nMashiro viewing Rika as a rival came out of nowhere. We've seen them be good friends and all, but all of a sudden in ep 11 we get a flashback that makes them rivals for some reason? Why? They never once gave any hints to the two seeing each other as rivals. The other flaw with this is, shouldn't Misaki be who Rika really wants to beat given it was her who beat Rika last tournament? Same for Mashiro and Satou, Mashiro should be more motivated to want to beat Satou whom she has lost to twice, once in practice and in the first tournament. It feels like the show got the rivalries wrong with these two, especially Mashiro.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nThe way the girls kept bothering Misaki in ep 8 was hard to watch because of how cringe worthy it was. If you truly are a friend, you need to leave people alone when they don't want to talk about something. They weren't being very considerate and just kept going out of their way to force it out of her, which thankfully Masaya eventually calls them out on it. One thing that made no sense was how they kept bugging Misaki so much, yet not one time asked Masaya if he had any idea how to catch her or why isn't he helping them. Again, why are they written this way?\\n\\n\r\nAs I've indicated many times already, the way the girls are written (especially Asuka) when it comes to Masaya is terrible, and the show really should have fixed it. There's no excuse for them being like this.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAs cool as the FC sport is to me, it did get repetitive very quickly. You touch someone's back or a buoy for a point, and maybe do a few fancy moves, and that's it. Everything starts to just be the same by ep 4. Saki brought a new style in which was cool, but it doesn't remove how repetitive the sport is. And that pains me to say, because honestly the matches are the best written parts of the show in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nThere is way too much focus on training and not enough focus on the characters themselves. Usually we get training, some comedy scenes and then matches. But we barely explore the characters is the problem, as I've said before. The biggest example being episode 10. This is the episode where Masaya finally plays with Grav-Shoes. It should have been a good time to develope Masaya's character by focusing in on him for a change while giving it a rest with the girls whom have hogged pretty much the whole show. We did not need to waste over 12 minutes on their training, it could have just been toned down to 4 minutes at best while Masaya gets explored and developed more. Which could have made him flying more earned and less forced. And various other episodes have the same issue of not exploring or doing much with the characters while focusing so much on the sport and training. I get they want to push the sport, but they pushed it so much the characters ended up suffering tremendously because of it.\u00a0Another thing is if they had delved more into the characters, we would be more invested in the matches because we actually care for these characters we've gotten to know. As it stands, we barely know anything about them, which makes it hard to care much for any of them or anything they go through. \\n\\n\r\nVerdict:\\n\\n\r\nAt best, this show is a 3/10 to me. It had a lot of potential to be decent to even fantastic, but it falls flat on execution, plot points, use and handling of characters, and overall writing. If you go into this turning your brain off completely, you might like this. But if you care about the writing, characters etc in a show clearly trying to tell a story like I do, then I can't recommend this to anyone besides the sport match parts. It does have a few good things about it, but a few good things don't make a show good.",
