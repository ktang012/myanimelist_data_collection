            "content": "Watching Irozuku Sekai no Ashita kara (Iroduku) is like a taking a journey into a storybook adventure. But in that adventure, there\u2019s magic, creativity, and feelings that\u2019s hard to be put into words alone. Produced by P.A. Works, I had high expectations for Iroduku considering their recent lineup. Being a powerhouse studio, P.A. Works has always captivated me with their wealth of ideas. From school life dramas to a dark thriller about vampires, this studio continues to establish themselves with their creativity.\r\nTo my delight, Iroduku turned out to be yet another show that made me realize how an original anime should be done. Believe me,this seemed like a hit or miss in the beginning that looked like an average modern teen soap opera. However, I would say not to judge too fast as the premise itself possesses great potential for a storyteller. From the beginning, we are introduced to the city of Nagasaki where magic is also part of normal life. We meet main female protagonist Hitomi Tsukishiro who happens to be a 17 year old descendant from a family of witches. What we know about her early on is that she has a disdain towards magic. It\u2019s because she lost her sense with colors and also became distant with people. The plot involves her grandmother Kohaku who decides to send her 60 years into the past so they can reconnect. To be honest, this show became a modern fantasy about self-discovery even with the time travel gimmick. At the center of it is Hitomi Tsukishiro.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll say right off the bat that the show will test a bit of the audience\u2019s patience. The pacing in the beginning is slow and doesn\u2019t jump over itself to sell its core concepts. But that\u2019s not really a negative of the show. I came to realize that the directors wanted to help the characters grow especially with important relationships. From the first few episodes, it\u2019s shown that Hitomi is not a sociable person and finds it difficult to open herself to others. That soon changes when she meets Yuito Aoi and the photography club. Through their influence, Hitomi begins to climb out of her shell. For some reason, Hitomi is also able to see Yuito\u2019s colors in his drawings. This is important as it enables the both of them to connect on a more personal level.\\n\\n\r\nIndeed, Iroduku shines best when it\u2019s able to capitalize on the character relationship development. Hitomi and Yuito is a prominent example. The show commits to developing their relationship from strangers to close friends. It felt like the creators wanted us to experience both of their character growth alongside them. Significantly enough, Hitomi does develop from a withdrawn witch girl into a more mature woman. This is thanks to the positive influence of Kohaku Tsukishiro, who also joins the Photography Club later on. What I find interesting about Kohaku is her outgoing personality and loyalty to her friends. From the beginning, she seems like the opposite of Hitomi and is easily open to others. At the same time, she\u2019s also a bit of a troublemaker for her experiments with magic at school. While I can\u2019t say she is a flawless character, Kohaku brings in a lot of hope for character development. Hitomi begins to regain her sense of magic but also able to make new friends. It\u2019s a very simple and acceptable way to see her character growth. \\n\\n\r\nNow you may be questioning yourself if this show contains romance as part of its storytelling. While the show itself isn\u2019t adamant on building romance, it does exist in some ways. As the story progresses, it seems Hitomi develops some feelings towards Yuito and vice versa. Their photography club president Shou Yamabuki also begins to show an attraction towards Hitomi. Meanwhile, there\u2019s Asagi Kazeno in the club who has an obvious crush towards Shou. You get the idea. Not to mention, misunderstandings ensue early in the series when Kurumi (vice president of the photography club) took a video of Hitomi coming out of Yuito\u2019s room. Romance angles exist in the show but really doesn\u2019t overshadow the story\u2019s flow. P.A. Works have been known to make anime with romance content that can get be stale and overly sensitive. Thankfully, Iroduku isn\u2019t the case even though it exists.\\n\\n\r\nStill, the big question to ask yourself is what\u2019s the most you can get out of this show? At best, this show works in wonders as a character driven story with a creative modern fantasy atmosphere. Every character in the show brings something to the table for their role. The show\u2019s main push though is Hitomi for her character growth and self-discovery. Whether you like it or not, the story focuses on her growing with more self-confidence and plays a central part in regaining her sense of magic. She even gets on better terms with characters like Asagi after the two understands each other more. Meanwhile, we also get some unique symbolisms. The most prominent one is the golden fish that symbolizes hope. Not only does Hitomi finds her own world now, she also grows to accept magic. This is also thanks to Kohaku\u2019s presence as she wants to make her granddaughter happy. Magic plays a role and she wants Hitomi to experience the best out of it. As you may expect, the show also contains time travels tropes. But really, this isn\u2019t a show about fixing the past but rather about changing a character in a positive way. I\u2019m probably going easy on this show in some ways but everything felt like it flows so well from start to finish. From Hitomi joining the photography club to experiencing cultural festival together with friends, P.A. Works manages to sell this series as a modern coming of age fantasy.\\n\\n\r\nEven if this show isn\u2019t your cup of tea for its drama, the technical content is a feast for the eyes. P.A. Works once again manages to showcase their talent with high level production quality. It\u2019s very well polished that makes the show itself look like a work of art. It\u2019s easy to also accept the show as a modern fantasy with the relaxing setting and lush backgrounds. Magic itself is portrayed in aesthetic style with blending of unique colors. As it\u2019s part of the plot, the show\u2019s visuals manages to capture the essence of that at its finest. My only pet peeve is the character expressions. An easy finger to point at is Hitomi for having the same face for the majority of the show. I get the creators wanted to portray her as a withdrawn girl in the beginning but it\u2019s hard to sometimes feel empathic about her on the surface. This is a contrast to pretty much almost every other character. As you may also expect, this show is very melancholic especially during some of the more emotional episodes. The theme songs reflects that as well along with voice mannerism in those cases.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s probably countless ways to accept this show but the simplest way is to embrace the character growth of the main protagonist, Hitomi. My initial impression of the show grew from a story about magic to how characters can change thanks to others\u2019 influence. Character relationships play a big role for its ability to capture the significance of their growth. Once again, P.A. Works shows how valuable their original anime can be. And to me, I can\u2019t help but recommend Iroduku for those who wants to experience more.",

            "content": "'With fewer colors, you might come to understand some important things. '\r\nIf you were given the chance to use magic, what will you do? Irozuku Sekai no Ashita kara, aka The World in Colors, is truly a beautiful show on the levels of Violet Evergarden and some films as well. But what breathes color into the show itself is the story, directed by Toshiya Shinohara, I have high hopes for this original written anime, and thus far it has been delivering quite well. Without further ado, lets dive right into this review. \r\nStory / Character   -9.5-\r\nSet in a world sixty years from now,people living in the future have been utilizing magic to ease up their life. However, our female protagonist Hitomi hates magic. The beautiful colors everyone sees turns monochrome for her, nothing enlightens her and she seems to have no friends. Her grandmother, Kohaku, knowing well of Hitomi's situation, decides to send her sixty years back to meet her younger self, in hopes of helping Hitomi to overcome the situation. After some strange interactions, Hitomi finds herself in a stranger's house, and escapes from it. A few encounters later she starts making friends and has found her grandmother and even her great grandmother, albeit at that time they might as well just be their sister and mother. However strangely enough, she notices she has dropped her important azurite, an equipment (?) from the future, and sets out to look for it. Coincidentally, it was dropped on the stranger's house, whom she found was drawing. As she approaches him, she saw colors that she has never seen for ages starting to come in life surrounding her. But when Yuito, the stranger himself stops her, the world goes back to monochromatic. \\n\r\nWith all these being said, this original story has a lot going for it at this point, the world building and the characters are very likable, and what enhances it by a LARGE MARGIN would be the art that im going to talk about next.\\n\\n\r\nArt   -10-\\n\r\nPA Works just outdone themselves, this show looks literally like cocaine but for your eyes. The background art is literally one of the best you can find in anime, the usage of colors and some indeed very unique camera angle really makes this show stand out from the rest this season. Character animations are very fluid and looks natural. Absolutely one of the best looking anime overall. \\n\\n\r\nSound   -10-\\n\r\nAs much as I want to give more credits to the voice acting on this show, what really steals the show is the OST, Opening and Ending. From the first episode I was already blown away from the soundtrack. The OST used are almost certainly beautiful, just as the show itself is. And as aforementioned, the OP/ED really isnt something I cant find myself ever skipping on, not only they look good, which Ive already strongly emphasized, but the song itself is, too, very impressive, especially the ED by Nagi Yanagi, one of my favourite artist. \\n\\n\r\nOverall   -10-\\n\r\nIf you are still wondering what you should be watching for this season, this show has got you covered good. With an interesting premise this show I have really high hopes for, and I personally can see this show ending with a lot of ninjas cutting onions behind the scenes. As someone who draws, this show is like a godsend for those who appreciates art. By all means, I really hope this show gets to more people with this humble review as I feel as of now this show is seemingly unappreciated.   \\n\\n",

Therefore, she travels back in time to join a school club in the past, falls in love with a teenager of her age and starts seeing colors again because feelings and happiness (assumably). Unicorns, rainbows and other nice stuff exist in the time where everything was better. Literally rainbows, not the meme. This is pretty much the stupidest reason I have heard for a time traveling story andthe content surely is not making it any better. It's practically every school club thingie ever done except its selling point are the magic and time traveling stuff that simply exist and nothing more, so basically, there is no selling point.\\n\\n\r\nThe mc is simply awful, and has the personality of a suicidal toddler. y tho? Because she stops crying about her angsty side the second someone throws a goddamn magic toy at her. Her very existence is annoying and whenever she does anything or just is there, her whole presence is yelling \"I am about to kill myself\" but her pathetic personality quietly whispering \"I can't do it.\" I paused the video first time in ep 1 at time stamp 7:30 and spend 5 minutes staring at her face that looked like this =( just to try and understand -- to figure out -- what is the point of her character. Why was this series made with some sort of pseudo-sad and borderline emo manner that is too bland and boring to be edgy and too stupid for me to give a damn about anything that she might or might not be feeling. \\n\\n\r\nThe time travelling concept itself is chaotically random to begin with. Grandma gives a hug and sends our mc in the year 2018 with nothing but a talking earring and a map with her. Good thing she happens to end up in just the right place and get instantly surrounded by characters who all seem to love her and not see what an uninteresting and sad person she is. Basically she is just a transfer student but for some reason, the series needed to be seasoned with some extra messy because -- well -- it can be done. Cool. The character development on the other hand makes no sense at all. Why couldn't this grill talk with people in her own timeline and stop being a lil bitch there? -- why this is possible in the current year but not in the original angsty timeline is beyond me. \\n\\n\r\nThe side characters and production all are decent, no problems there -- I would even praise the art if I thought it mattered -- but this thing is sucking because of the main lead is... this character and the series' excuse to even exist is beyond lame.  \\n\\n\r\nThe only way I have been able to enjoy this thing at all is laughing at scenes such as our mc trying to open windows or asking people \"what is a band-aid?\" I like to imagine that she doesn't know these things not because she is from the future where they don't apparently exist, but because she is so fucking stupid.",

            "content": "I feel that it\u2019s safe to say that all stories in some essence are contrived. I mean these are works of fiction, fake stories concocted by a writer/s imagination.  From characters, settings, plot conventions, conveniences, and  anything else under the sun, the writer has full control to manipulate them however they wish. Of course this is only looking at a work in a very reductionist point of view.  Because even if they are contrived, most don\u2019t give off the air or feel of being one. Due to the fact of the creators embellishing their stories that makes their characters more compelling, thesettings having a sense of place, and for the plot to come off as more \u201cnaturel\u201d. Why is all this important?  Well because Irozuku seems to be in conflict with two different elements, with one being the tale of self growth as a character and the other being a magical time travel romantic melodrama. \\n\\n\r\nFrom the start off it\u2019s easy to see that there was a good amount of effort put into the visuals of the show. With a show with the name color in its name, it does make sure to bring it to the screen with a vibrant color pallet being applied to almost everything. However sometimes the vibrancy doesn\u2019t work in it\u2019s favor when it comes to the characters as they come of as glossy making them at time look a bit plastic like. What also doesn\u2019t help for their characters is their designs, at least their faces. While i\u2019m kind of fine with most shows and their minimalist design of the faces this show takes a it a small step more that ends up being to far. With the nose being far to small, and thanks to the glossy look of the show almost non-existent, and that could also play in part with now the eyes looking a bit far apart from the face that they start to look like fish people. \\n\\n\r\nAnyway the main story is about Hitomi, a girl from the future, where magic is commonplace and not the type where technology is advance that it\u2019s like magic, but actual magic. Due to her very strained relationship with her mother, she has lost the color in her life. I don\u2019t mean in a metaphorically melancholic way, but she has honestly become monochromatic colorblind. Then her grandmother comes and has some inkling of how her granddaughter feels and then she just sends her to the past, after which this series of events happen. Hitomi wakes up in some guys empty room, she \u201csecretly\u201d leaves but forgets her earing, she is seen by some people who happen to be the friends of the guy living in the room, she realizes she lost her earring, she finds the guy who lived in that room with her earing, and finally the guys drawing are the only thing that Hitomi can see in color, and mind you that this is just the first episode. It\u2019s not all the small conveniences that are the problem, but how they constantly stack up on one another that makes them so forced and so contrived. Events like these happen every once in a while in the show, and across multiple episodes that it is easy to be taken out of the experience that it is trying to sell. \\n\\n\r\nNow i\u2019m not going to get into the whole time travel thing since that\u2019s a whole beast i don\u2019t care enough to go into it, other than it\u2019s just kind of dumb. The magic i don\u2019t mind as much and i\u2019m fine having it be somewhat ambiguous. However it\u2019s obvious how these are used as plot devices and probably the main vehicle why so many parts of the story just feel so forced. \\n\\n\r\nIt just leaves lingering questions of why the creators of this work would go to such lengths to create such extraneous plot lines for a show about personal growth. Sure this is an anime original and it was trying to be original in its premise from other derivative Japanese high school anime. But that\u2019s just how far they went, only the premise. Since outside of the whole magic and time travel thing all that\u2019s left is a dull school romantic melodrama. None of which are bad elements but the show does nothing to make them work in its favor. There\u2019s not much about the romance that makes it really endearing or compelling. Especially with how all the characters are \u201ccoupled up\u201d  with the main couple, the childhood friends, and the other two. None of them are in actual relationships with each other but the show still makes a point to make it overtly obvious. Even when there\u2019s romantic conflicts which make up most of the melodrama portion. Most of it is just eye rolling and annoying and makes me internally scream, \"get on with it already\"! These problems probably had more to do with the characters themselves. There\u2019s not really much to them when it goes to characterization and personality since it\u2019s rather basic and on the surface and the few who do have some character development, it\u2019s also rather basic and isn\u2019t really that well done. There\u2019s not much about them that makes them really compelling. Even the main character and her developing from her angst into a better person in end is still a dull character. \\n\\n\r\nNow the whole show isn\u2019t that bad. The theme of self growth is rather consistent across the show and it does have moments that are rather good and touching. It even hits a really good stride during the last two or three episodes, even if it\u2019s undermined by more plot contrivance. The production value is fine even if there are some poor decisions with the directing of the show like when it the POV of Hitomi but from her perspective she can still see color and then a few seconds later it turns to monochrome to make a point that she\u2019s color blind in case it wasn\u2019t obvious enough times. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end there\u2019s not much that is worthwhile about this show. With a cast of just boring 2-dimensional characters. A plot that could have gone down a more simpler road while still maintaining it\u2019s core theme, but opted for a more convoluted yet easily convenient one. There\u2019s not much that hides the intrinsic contrivances of the story. Maybe the show should have upped the plastic look of the characters so the writing could have something to match with.\\n",

            "content": "I think, and I believe that this anime has a lot of potential, and needs its improvements in different ways. \r\n(This review contains light spoilers.)\r\nStory: 8\r\nThe story could be better, but I was hoping for the main character to not be so clueless, I mean, she did come from a different world not knowing as much, I think she could've been improved if she was just a normal human being that looks up upon her life as a whole. I'm not saying that it's bad, or it's just downright stupid. I'm saying this like how I reflect upon the story, and how much I wouldlove to reflect upon it many more times. This show has tons of potential, and I think that there is very little for them to improve on. I feel like they should've made Hitomi teleport somewhere else instead of the dudes house. Don't you think that's a little bit weird? (Yuito)\\n\r\n(Hitomi is waifu quality, and she can be. am i right or am i wrong?) \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\\n\r\nWow, never have I seen such exquisite art on my laptop screen. This kind of art is something that they were very dedicated by putting together a sequential series, or perhaps a showcase of very many talented artists in one show. After watching the first few episodes, I believe that this anime makes very flawless art in many different aspects that I could never ever imagine of as myself, a human being. (or filthy weeb trash.) Getting to the point, the abstract art that you've seen today, which is from this anime, is something to behold and to get together with your friends, eating popcorn as you stare in awe of this stupendous art. \\n\r\n(Maybe I'm saying too much?)\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\\n\r\nI love the opening theme song so much, and I think that makes me think about how it would better if Yuito were to be drawing the whole entire opening and ending as time flows in the full opening track. The ending as well could well, made from magic from Hitomi. Although she isn't a professional at magic, I think she would have the courage to do that and impress the others that watch the anime. The ending theme song makes me sad, and the sadness I feel is the happiness that gives me to enjoy the anime. I hope for this anime to make more better music. If you haven't listened to the full OP, then I highly suggest it. Also, be the one weeb that downloads and saves it to their library for the next 5 years. (that's me)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\\n\r\nHitomi is just a weird ass girl that doesn't know much about reality. She makes magic out of thin air, trying to impress Yuito. (Let's be real here, she is a waifu, and I think that every waifu is cute when they're just dumb out of their mind.)\\n\\n\r\nYuito should've went home earlier, and made sure Hitomi was safe and sound in her house to carry out his  \"deeds.\" (\u02f5 \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0\u02f5)\\n\\n\r\nKohaku is just another waifu that needs to be noticed in the anime. (waifus are deliciou- i mean what?)\\n\\n\r\nAll of the characters are just side characters. You don't need to worry about them rather than Yuito and Hitomi. (I ship them so hard. But I hope this won't be like there's romance on the last episode cause that's pretty dumb if you ask me.)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI was stumbling upon the fall anime list and saw this. I thought this would have a male lead, but it's always nice to have a woman as beautiful as Hitomi lead the show as the female lead. Though, I thought it was pretty tragic for her grandmother to cast her away from her, to a whole new parallel world, or maybe was it just on the other side of world? Who knows? But getting to the important part, I was just sitting down in my chair with my laptop open. I was watching this. Never have I regretted saying: \"This show is gonna be terrible.\" Even though a show like this will amaze you by how talented the art that they show us, is something that we should be praising for. I have high hopes for this anime to improve as time passes by. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\nI gotta admit, for a show this high for my ratings is something I would just wish for more episodes by going on my knees, crying and begging for more seasons as the future comes by. But you know the drill, once new anime has been aired, you know to not get so sad about something that's just on a screen. This is no more than just an ordinary screen, it's beautiful art in the making. I hope for the best for this anime! \\n",

            "content": "SOME SPOILERS PRESENT BELOW\r\nIrozuku is a show that tries to mask its lack of plot and even remotely good characters with nice colors. That's really about it. It's reminiscent of Violet Evergarden as to how it tries to ride off of its art, except Evergarden doesn't have a pathetic cast of characters and a boring plot.\r\nStory (5/10): For some reason, this show isn't listed as a Slice of Life, which is very strange, considering the plot is much more boring than your average Slice of Life. Honestly, there really isn't a story. They're in their club, they take pictures, and something about the main girlbeing semi-colorblind. It's basically a Slice of Life without the tag. Then, lo and behold, in the last 3 episodes or so, drama drops out of nowhere straight onto your head, most likely giving you a concussion. Remember guys, drama means sad, and sad means good. That seems to be the golden rule of MAL users. Sad = good. But how am I supposed to feel sad when the characters are as well written as a fourth grader's spelling test?\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (1/10): When you've got pretty much no plot for most of the show, you end up focusing on the characters. When your characters have effectively no defining character traits or personalities, well, you've got a problem. I still don't remember half of the characters' names after finishing the show. Well, sure, the characters might be boring, but you still have character development to make things interesting, right? Well, no, you don't. Unless you count \"this character likes that character\" as conflict/character development, there is literally no character development until the last 3 episodes, where pretty much everything just takes a left turn. Now those plastic bottle characters from the last 10 episodes you watched are in a sad situation, so you have to feel sad. Just try to forget that they literally barely qualified as characters for the past 10 episodes. It's pretty amazing that P.A. Works managed to create a worse cast of characters than that of Ch\u00e4oS;HEAd. There's 2 even remotely decent characters, and one of them is comic relief. I'll just rate the characters individually on a scale of 0 to 5 below.\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nHitomi (0/5): The only feature of her personality is that she can't see colors. Yukiteru Amano probably has more going for him.\\n\\n\r\nMain guy (1/5): Generic edgy loner\\n\\n\r\nClub president (0/5): I don't even know what to put here. He actually just doesn't have any character traits whatsoever. The epitome of a worthless supporting character. Somehow him falling in love with Hitomi was supposed to be a character trait.\\n\\n\r\nChigusa (2/5): Kinda serves as comic relief sometimes?\\n\\n\r\nGlasses girl (1/5): Really just only there for the same repeated fights with Chigusa, kinda got boring after the first time that happened.\\n\\n\r\nAsagi (1/5): She's cute, and she likes taking pictures of cute things. What a greatly defined character. Oh yeah, she likes the club president guy. There appears to be some sort of trend here, where the characters are defined not by themselves, but by who they like, or by the story.\\n\\n\r\nKohaku (3/5): Has more personality than pretty much the rest of the cast combined. She's actually not dead inside! Whenever anything remotely interesting happens, it's usually centered around her magic.\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10): Hey look it's the good part of the show. Everyone knows art is the most important part of a show! Seriously though, the art is beautiful. Amazing color variety/combinations. The scenes where magic is used are absolutely breathtaking. The only reason it doesn't pull a 10/10 is that there are random close-ups of characters' faces in semi-profile views where their nose is just completely off-center. Really bothers me when the whole screen is a character's messed up face. What are their noses doing on their cheeks?\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10): Generic OST with nothing outstanding. Above average opening theme. I've never listened to an ending theme in my life. The music is simple, and it works well for the kind of show that it is. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (4/10): The only show that I watched this season where I didn't feel the desire to watch it on the day it airs. Hell, I even watched Tokyo Ghoul every Tuesday, even though :re 2 is an absolute disgrace. I don't hate the show though. Somehow the art makes this somewhat slightly enjoyable if you don't think hard about it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (4/10): Do you like getting hit over the head with the exact same conflict? Do you have 25 minutes to just completely waste? Do you have some form of ADHD that prevents you from paying attention to what's actually unfolding in front of your eyes? Do you enjoy having a block of drama concrete dropped onto your head? If you answered yes to any 2 out of 4 of these questions, you'll probably enjoy the show. If you didn't, there's plenty of better things to do with your time than watch this.",

I don't even need to mention the art, cause anyone can see that it is truly a masterpiece. One of the most aesthetically pleasing anime I've ever seen! Just the art itself makes me wanna cry.\r\nI've enjoyed every second of every episode so far, always thinking in the back of my mind that I really don't want this anime to end... The story isso full of meaning, love, friendship, self confidence, and growing up issues. Wow I sound so cringe. But this show really got to me, you know.\\n\\n\r\nEvery character seems so genuine and passionate. Hitomi had to go to the past to be able to find and express her true self. She finally opened up and saw herself surrounded by friends. Yet she is meant to be living 60 years in the future, when all of those people are already much older and have already lived most of their lives. Hitomi felt wanted for the first time in her life, however she has to choose between staying there or going back to the future, where her life's meant to be lived.\\n\\n\r\nI've been preparing myself for all the tears that are about to come with this show's ending, but I don't think I'm ready for it at all. I just keep wondering on what's gonna happen if she stays and what's gonna happen if she goes back. Their lives are gonna be forever changed, and I'm so here to see it all.\\n\\n\r\nBeautiful anime, please watch it and cry with me.\\n",

            "content": "Alright P.A. Works, what've you got up your sleeve this time?\u00a0 Let's see...can't see colors; she's colorblind, that's kinda interesting.\u00a0 Magic, sent back in time...ok, a time traveling series.\u00a0 Could pose some problems, but I'm sure it won't bite them in the ass.\u00a0 Hopefully.\u00a0 Shinohara Toshiya as the series director.\u00a0 Why does that name sound familiar?\u00a0 Director of...NagiAsu?\u00a0 Oh goddamnit.\r\nStory:\r\nIn a version of Japan where magic is prominent, Tsukishiro Hitomi watches from afar at fireworks that she used to watch with her mother, only to see black and white.\u00a0 All color is lost in her vision, and the world she lives in exists in anashen gray.\u00a0 Her grandmother, Kohaku, comes up to her and really without word or warning, sends her granddaughter back in time to the time when she was a student sixty years in the past.\u00a0 It's here where Hitomi is forced upon an older world in hopes to help her and with the help of her grandmother's younger self, restore color to her granddaughter's world.\\n\\n\r\nThe mantra of P.A. Works and the company's main selling point are the original works they manage to pump out each year, hardly doing any actual adaptations of light novels or manga in favor of original stories.\u00a0 Irozuku appears as the latest in the company's lineup with some very mixed results.\u00a0\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nThe story focuses on Hitomi and her journey to break out of her shell, capitalizing on the themes on how important people are in our lives and that as long as you have someone close to you, you're never alone.\u00a0 A simple plot with enough punch and potential to grant the viewer an emotional and powerful journey when done well.\u00a0 But this is kind of the fault line where Irozuku borders on 'has potential' and 'wasted potential'.\u00a0 The setup with a group of friends of mixed genders almost always has some kind of romantic subplot going in the background, which given the director's history of NagiAsu was assuredly guaranteed.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nWhile Hitomi is certainly at the forefront of the majority of the story, what ends up being a lacking component is how the rest of the characters around her are formulated as characters.\u00a0 The story lumps up every one or two of her friends together for a character arc, showcasing their respective ups and downs in their personalities to Hitomi so that ultimately everyone grows as people.\u00a0 Issue here is how uneventful everything feels.\u00a0 The show never seems to reach a true emotional high point that makes it possible for me to give a damn, instead choosing to have several smaller bumps that little amount to a few shed tears instead of true emotional breakdown, a shame considering the validity of one given some of the cast's problems.\u00a0 This problem ends up bleeding into Hitomi as well since while yes she does have significant change, it feels subtle enough to almost not matter, had it not been for the ending giving us a proper epilogue to the entire story.\\n\\n\r\nRomantic subplots also plague this story (and many other of P.A.'s works), resulting in an expected, yet also very lukewarm result.\u00a0 I don't understand why they thought that having a romance in a story where a girl is sent back 60 years in the past only to assuredly go back by the end was a good idea to begin with.\u00a0 Honestly, the show could've just not made it so that there was any romance between the characters and it would almost assuredly have the same impact.\u00a0 I actually feel like the show was constricting itself with it because it's like \"Oh, we HAVE to have this tragic romance where they can't be together for tension\" instead of just having the entire group just be really good friends.\u00a0 The fact that it doesn't really go anywhere either does make it a harmless add-in, but also raises the question of what the point of having romance was to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nStory-wise, the show's only true, major upside lies in its ending where everything is wrapped in a neat bow, glorifying the journey as an emotional rollercoaster of emotions.\u00a0 The embellishment is kind of unreal for a good majority of the meandering that happens in the plot, but it serves to give the story a satisfying conclusion that it otherwise wouldn't have given the fact that it puts Hitomi's entire character arc into perspective.\u00a0 It's probably the only aspect of the story that I like, which if nothing else, gives me hope that 'Hey, at least P.A. can do endings now'.\u00a0\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nHitomi herself is a depressing character, moping around for a majority of the plot due to her shy and walled-off nature where she's afraid to inconvenience people, hates her existence as a mage, and bears the burden of the conflict that she had with her mother.\u00a0 Despite a potential breeding ground for growth, ultimately I don't really like Hitomi as a character.\u00a0 It never feels like she's truly at the forefront of the story despite all of the other characters making her so.\u00a0 She definitely has her moments in the spotlight where she does take initiative and acts on her own accord to not only better herself and hone in her qualities as a mage, but the majority of her character just doesn't feel like she does anything meaningful due to her innately shy and soft-spoken nature.\u00a0\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nKohaku is the only other character that I feel has any real moments in the spotlight.\u00a0 As Hitomi's grandmother de-aged sixty years, Kohaku serves as the spunky and outspoken character who loves magic, the complete opposite to her granddaughter.\u00a0 While Kohaku doesn't really get a character arc herself, a lot of what she does serves to make the plot happen, showing us the amount of work she puts in to better herself as a mage and takes responsibility of what her older self has done.\u00a0\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast suffers from honestly, not being all that memorable.\u00a0 Chigusa, Sho, Kurumi, and Asagi all have their moments in the spotlight, but never to the point where their existence is validated enough beyond a part of the whole that is the 'group'.\u00a0 Their respective claims to fame exist for maybe an episode or two at the most, which I feel is a shame considering the potential for this show.\u00a0 The only standout character of 'The Group' is Aoi Yuito, an aspiring artist who while has a character arc in line with Hitomi, also suffers the same problems as her being that his innate character traits restrict the potential that he has.\u00a0 Romantic subplot also makes his growth feel a lot less genuine than it could've been.\u00a0\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nIf there's at least one thing that I love from P.A. Works, it's just how much they love their artwork.\u00a0 At least for a majority of their projects.\u00a0 Characters are drawn in the signature P.A. style with a bit more care put into them compared to Kuromukuro or Shirobako of projects past, and the background and panning shots rival that of KyoAni's quality.\u00a0 Bright colors, a beautiful shimmer over everything, and impressive effects and utilization of CGI make for a visually stunning show that makes everything look that much nicer, especially with the fact that show has magic.\\n\\n\r\nThere're a lot of glitter effects in this show.\u00a0 Shine and typical magical flair are common due to two of the main characters being mages by trade, so what we end up getting is a lot more 'movie magic' put into many scenes in order to add a unique charm to everything.\u00a0\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nBoth \"17 Sai\" by Haruka to Miyuki and \"Mimei no Kimi to Hakumei no Mahou\" by Nagi Yanagi act as somber pieces that exemplify the trapped and emotional feeling of Hitomi's journey.\u00a0 (Or at least its potential)\u00a0 You really get the feeling of growing outwardness with the OP and the somber qualities of Hitomi's lonely personality through these songs.\u00a0 Aesthetics have always felt like P.A.'s strong point, and I'm glad that these tracks came out as good as they did.\u00a0\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI love P.A. Works as a company.\u00a0 I really do.\u00a0 But loving them is a real exercise in frustration because of how much hope I put into their works only for that hope to be slandered by the end result of their newest project.\u00a0 It's gotten to a point that I kind of dread whatever comes next and coined the term 'Doing a P.A. Works' for myself whenever a show with potential ends up floundering at the end cause the execution is just poor.\u00a0 Shinohara Toshiya was also a massive red flag for me considering NagiAsu is one of the biggest examples for how P.A. Works manages to falter its writing and potential towards the tail end of a series, especially due to love triangles and tension within the group because of that.\\n\\n\r\nBut Irozuku doesn't manage the same as its predecessors, instead having a new trend of: A story with good potential, floundered middle, and a good end.\u00a0 I don't like this pattern, but it's a new one for the company nonetheless.\u00a0 It feels to me almost like P.A. played it safe this time, choosing to go for what they normally do but tone it back so much that any high impact moments feel like a light tap instead of a punch to the gut that it probably should've been so that they don't screw up so badly by doing something like 'Pull a Charlotte'.\u00a0 The end of that created a lukewarm series that feels like it accomplished sort of what it wanted to do, but did it in a way that made whatever was being show only have a subtle enough impact to insinuate that SOMETHING happened, but maybe not.\u00a0\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nReally I stand at a bit of an impasse with P.A. this time cause it's not like they ruined what they made.\u00a0 Quite the opposite really considering I was extremely afraid of the inherent problem of a time traveler who has to go back going back in time and falling in love with someone from the past.\u00a0 It ended exactly how I wanted (and expected) it to despite the romantic subplot, and for that I breathe a sigh of relief.\u00a0 Still, even with the ending being as good if not a little better than what I expected it to be, I still don't find Irozuku to be little more than something that deserved a better execution than what it got.\\n\\n\r\nAs such, I can't really recommend this show cause I can't give a proper assessment on account of the fact that it doesn't sit right with me.\u00a0 It's not great, it's not terrible, it's not average cause it has too many problems in its middle portion to just be a 'meh' product, but it's not so bad that it doesn't have its good points.\u00a0 So honestly, make your own judgment on whether or not this is worth a watch.\u00a0 As for me, I hope that we don't get another Shinohara Toshiya for a long while.\u00a0 Irozuku is a lot less heavy-handed and stressful than NagiAsu is to watch, but assessing his works and by extension anything P.A. Works does takes up a lot of time.\u00a0 I blame on the fact that I care about the company too much.",

Just beginning of the first episode, it has already displayed amazing talents to be one of the best anime of the year.\r\nAlso, because it's about TIME TRAVEL, when it's time travel there's always this suspense element, suspecting if Hitomi's going to end up with Aoi or they are forced to separate after that. Besides that, I love the opening and the ending of the anime, also totally worth listening to. In addition, every time watching it, it has the right feels that hit you that grabs your attention and makes you tobe dedicated to it. The characters are all awesome especially Yuito and Aoi. (Most probably gonna be a sad ship)\\n\\n\r\nIn a nutshell, it's an outstanding anime that has the right story, art, sound, character and enjoyment. Any anime fans should never miss it, if you do you will regret it for the rest of your life until you actually watch it! So, go watch it now!",

            "content": "A underrated hidden gem of the fall season.This show actually depicts the literal and true meaning of colors in life. Another good thing it's an original series which makes it quite more interesting..\r\nThe start of the series begins in a world sixty years from now, people where people have incorporated using various magic to ease up their life. \r\nBut our female protagonist Hitomi who comes from a family of magicians hates magic. The very irony. \r\nAlso she has another dilemma color blindness. The cause? Quite a mystery. She's doesn't feel much joy from life. Leads quite a monotonous life. \r\nHer grandmother, Kohaku, knowing what hitomiis going through, decides to send her sixty years back to meet her younger self, in hopes of helping Hitomi to overcome the situation.\\n\r\nAnd now the Story begins with hitomi living life in the past along with the grandmother and her other school friends. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 7/10\\n\r\nOur female Mc Hitomi. As I said earlier at the start she is quite the typical shy, a little slight depressed, quiet character.She doesn't like magic due to apparent reasons. But throughout the series she shows slow but good character development from liking, learning and using magic to opening up with her emotions and learning to enjoy life more.\\n\r\nQuite pleasant to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOur male Mc Aoi. Quite the normal Mc at first, but more to him than meets the eye. A excellent artist with his drawings. Sensible and smart. But still has some personal problems with his motivation and desire to draw and create art. \\n\\n\r\nInteresting thing, the only place Hitomi can see colors is Aoi's drawings, which literally come to life for her, Magic? well you can find that for yourselves. Obviously she is mysteriously attracted to it, curious and wanting to see more. Aoi on the other hand with his problems is also intrigued by this unique situation as he later gets to know about her color blindness.\\n\r\nSo now both share and develop a unique bonding  & start trying to figure out and indirectly help with each others situation, while growing closer to each other at the same time. \\n\r\nAt the few end episodes of the series a strong hint of romance is indicated between them \\n\\n\r\nThen there is the grandmother or lets say the young version of grandmother Kohaku. She is for me the MVP of the series. A Joyful, carefree girl who is not only smart and skilled at magic, but also knows how to play the wingman for our two MC's. \\n\r\nShe also can be a serious & sensible person who you can rely for advice and help in need. Great character and waifu material for sure.\\n\\n\r\nThe Other side characters are interesting too. They provide good entertainment to the main story and support to the MC's and have bit of decent development to their personalities as well. \\n\r\nThey don't have any extra ordinary qualities, but i really like it, mainly because of how good the relationships built between the characters are. \\n\r\nStory 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is a combination of Slice of life, Magic and Romance. Magic is the main concept, which is definitely shown and represented in abundance and in quality.\\n\\n\r\nThe story presented to be honest is a bit complicated but rather it is really well supported by the supernatural and fantasy element with a bit of emotions and feels thrown into the mix. \\n\r\nThe Beautiful concept and application of Magic is displayed which along with the stunning visual scenarios can be breathtaking at times for real.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIt just shows us how beautiful and deep meaning colors have in our life, which depicting every bit of deep emotions.\\n\r\nHitomi's character especially when we see the monochrome view through her perspective, we realize how dull and monotonous life is without colors, not literally but the actual color of life.\\n\r\nAlso,most of the times it maintains its the simplicity which is really enjoyable\\n\\n\r\nOne thing i was slightly disappointed was they took a bit of time for story progress and mainly character development, and very less amount of drama and romance. Which was later a bit rushed and incorporated in the final few episodes.\\n\r\nThey could have done better in that department considering its a original series. \\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nThe Best part of the series and i mean for real. like literally if i could say If any anime could come close to Violet Evergarden in terms of animation this year. It would be this series\\n\\n\r\nI mean PA Works just outdone themselves, i mean literally blew me out of my seat from the first episode and got me hooked The background art is literally one of the best you can find in anime,the multi admirable display and usage of colors and some indeed very well captured unique camera angles and beautiful sceneries, literally makes this show stand out from the rest. \\n\r\nCharacter animations are very smooth and looks natural. Absolutely top quality animations. Mad respect again to PA Works. I would watch it again Just for the Art and animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nI want to appreciate voice acting on this show and the background sound track, really well done. But more than that, i want to give a heartfelt applause to really to the OST, both Opening and Ending tracks. \\n\r\nFrom the first episode I was already like *WOW* from the soundtracks. The OST used are almost certainly beautiful, just as the show itself is, its really heartwarming and melodic. \\n\\n\r\nOn a side note i really love the ED \"Mimei no Kimi to Hakumei no Mahou\" sung by Nagi Yanagi, what a talent. The song itself is so melancholic and soothing with the amazing animation again. \\n\r\nIt just makes me wanna close my eyes and let the song take me away for real.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion \\n\r\nI would just say, please watch it. This show is really amazing and consistent with its Stunning mind blowing, Visuals,Satisfying plot, likable characters, the wonderful world of colorful Magic and a bit of a powerful message to the meaning of people and colors in life.\\n\r\nLets just say how the right people bring different colors to your life. Great Job PA works again wonderful work done right. \\n\r\nIt started unexpectedly for me but this series still made me craving for more right to the end. Good stuff.\\n",

            "content": "Before this review starts, learn something about rare myopia:\r\nMonochromacy, or Achromatopsia, is a true rarity in the world of myopic colour blindness. Or in layman terms: \"People with monochromatic vision can see no colour at all, and their world consists of different shades of grey ranging from black to white, rather like only seeing the world on an old black and white television set. Achromatopsia is extremely rare, occurring only in approximately 1 person in 33,000 and its symptoms can make life very difficult.\"\r\nThat's the circumstances that befalls on the life and upbringing of Hitomi Tsukushiro, a 17-year-old emotionless girl, and the descendant of awitch family, growing up in total colour blindness and having blimps of magic in life. Raised in the future, and then in the year 2078, her grandmother Kohaku chocks up some time-travelling sand to send Hitomi back to the present day of the year 2018 (since it's an original-sourced work by Natsuka Yashio) to fix her sorry state before everything is as it were 60 years down the line, to help her understand what it means to see the world in colours through the different sets of eyes from the people she interacts with: Be it her own same-aged grandmother, and the Magic Photography Club members (especially Yuito, with her first encounter being after dropped from the time-sending bus, escaping from his house, then unconsciously meeting him face-to-face with his drawing that at long last brought the sight of colors into her life).\\n\\n\r\nThe life that Hitomi has to be lead on is one that has to be well-trodden, and under special circumstances, if all she has ever going for her is the constant but gradual help from the other Magic Photography Club members (Asagi, Kurumi, Yuito, Chigusa, Sho, along with Kohaku) in requesting her to do activities that help each other see differing views of one another, along with some enhancement magic spellcasting from Kohaku (at the time when everyone in school sees her magic as either a nuisance or an asset). With Kohaku's request to help Hitomi regain her colour of sight (or lose that colour blindness either way, even for a brief moment), everyone has a wandering feeling about Hitomi at first glance, but as soon as she starts to slowly open up (which I feel her shyness/closed-up introversion is painful but relatable to watch), they understand where she's coming from and attempt to help her experience the typical person's life that's full of colour and happiness (with some help from Kohaku's magic spellcasting). Viewpoint from story and characters are engaging yet also alert on their surroundings, and the character development of each and everyone feels as if they're on a joyride, going through the numerous pangs of life.\\n\\n\r\n*Spoiler ALERT* And here's where I have a nitpick for hits and a BIG miss. Knowing director Toshiya Shinohara (being well known for Nagi no Asukara, another P.A. Works classic), the miss is in the romance segment. If you watch the OP animations bit by bit, you can tell that the pairings of the characters are immediately on-sight (Asagi X Sho, Chigusa X Kurumi, Yuito X Hitomi). Take for example, in Episode 9, Sho asks a regular request of Hitomi, of going together around the city to take photos (a.k.a. A foolish way to ask her on a date), and then confesses to her emotionless state before unknowingly running away from his reply, to then Asagi has to confront her about the entire situation, then explain from Hitomi's perspective, and as a means to an end, reconcile without any know-how, for the sake of prolonging (unnecessary) drama. That's just blatant \"insert casual\" writing and a waste of resources (production, airtime, not to mention $$$ to boot). No wonder there's a lot of flak on this particular episode where nothing makes sense from the departure against the good flow of the series (to that end). If there was a choice, this episode seriously needs to be cut out.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the hits are subtle and ever-growing interaction of the cast, but the blandness (of Hitomi's character drive) and boredom (Club members always doing the same-but-different things over and over again) can set in when at least expected, and draw the audience away from the big picture, which is seeing Hitomi recognize her space and vision of colour in her own world. Not to mention, that since Yuito is the solutional catalyst for Hitomi's predicament, the last arc (where Hitomi has to contemplate living in the now vs. going back to her time) has both of them recognizing their feelings for one another, and the build-up from being one of the club members right down to the final moments where Hitomi gradually disappearing/fading from the current time, has him really down to the core of whether to accept Hitomi for who she is, and Episode 11's bittersweet end (where their endless run to close hugging embrace) just encapsulates how much they really need one another to breathe life (or colour rather) into each other. Such a cool and good moment for never-ending cheek-rolling tears of joy. In the end, Hitomi manages to see colours, this time with both eyes too, so objective cleared for the character cast (and mostly Yuito for being with her in the final stages)! What a pleasant sight to behold.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're like the studio NUT of concern (like how I am always), there's nothing to fear with P.A. Works standards as per the main course of relinquishment. And this time, the production staff just 1-upped themselves as the whole production is absolutely the real deal. For a series that embodies colours as its main source of documentation, both art and animations are a step above anything else that can be equaled (or close) to anything KyoAni could ever have done. Instaneous great care has been taken responsible by the animators, photographers and even the artists, and the evidence is translated into the obscenely colourful visuals with great contrasting variety and combinations that is just eye-dropping, and pairing up is the smooth-buttery animation that the studio is known for with great angled POVs that really stand out amongst the competition. Overall, I'd say for the year, this stands in line with KyoAni's Violet Evergarden for the most grand productions ever made.\\n\\n\r\nSound-wise, this is technically another competent area as well. The OST really shines (with the aid of background visuals of course) with the finest ways it could to a certain degree. Haruka to Miyuki's \"17 Sai\" embodies the feelings of 17-year-old young adults (in this case, the character cast) trying to imagine how to live life with expressions translated into colours. And I've gotta admit, it's a cool song that speaks about living life to the fullest, and bringing forth the technicolour feel (that initially I hated it but after hearing the song over and over, I began to love it for what it is). And if you know Nagi Yanagi's repertiore of calm-collected-composure songs, the ED is really no different, and is once again, light-hearted and speaks volumes about Hitomi's future of monotony and colour with contrasting effects. A somewhat heavy-sentimental song that still manages to tug at the hearts of many (including myself).\\n\\n\r\nAs it is with the hype of P.A. Works production, I'm equally content that I managed to watch this interesting premise of a show, learn some pointers (not the romance part though) and be stunned by how everything works together to create an excellent aesthetic of visuals and great emotional character-driven development, that just begs the question of how does all of it come together to create a moment that seemingly won't last forever, but will forever be remembered for times to come. The only reason I can see people dropping this is just the slow-but-progressive storytelling, and the bland MC Hitomi (but trust me, there's 1001 reasons why for her unsentimental self). But I plead you, overlook these potential problems, and you'll have a show that's well deserving of its initial under-appreciation. Guess this could be a recommendation if you are an aspiring artist, or someone who loves to see artistic beauty at its finest.\\n\\n\r\nThere won't be simply a show like this and Iroduku is a masterpiece in its own right (although great to begin with).",

            "content": "I just have 3 words to say: SASUGA P.A. WORKS! Irozuku had all the Nagi no Asukara vibes yet it had it's own originality to set it apart from Nagi no Asukara. I absolutely loved watching Irozuku no Ashita Kara. From the story, to the characters, animation and music, they were all 10/10!!!\r\nStory: It all started when Grandma Kohaku decided to send Hitomi back 60 years to the past. That's when all the feels and romance started. It was as if fate had intervened. Hitomi ended up in Yuito's room and met Yuito when he was drawing. That was when she realized she could seethe colors in his drawing. At first Yuito was surprised, but as the two of them bonded together in the same club, romance started to fill the air as both fell in love with each other. They both went out with each other, chased each other down the street, and hugged each other in a final act of love. Alas, Hitomi had to return to her timeline, but that was not the end of their relationship just yet. Something interfered with Kohaku's magic and sent both Yuito and Hitomi to another world, a dull world. However, as Hitomi and Yuito both confessed to and hugged each other, the curse of Hitomi started to break apart, and Hitomi realized that she could finally see color again. After saying their final goodbyes, Hitomi was finally sent back to the future. God I feel like I'm writing a romance novel. In other story, this story is about Hitomi's growth as a person as she interacts with other characters. At first, she was cold, shy and rather aloof. However, she soon becomes a warm and friendly person, willing to talk to others and help them. I love how the characters interacted with one another and the various ships associated with them. Sho X Asagi, Kurumi X Chigusa and the stars of the show, Hitomi X Yuito. The story is also heartwarming full of feels! I cried while watching certain episodes. Overall a 10/10 story. The only criticism I can give is they rushed the middle of the anime a bit so there's a bit of inconsistency when it comes to the pacing of the show.\\n\r\nRating: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: You know that animation will be on point when P.A. Works is the one animating the anime. The animation was like Nagi no Asukara, PERFECTION! I loved the animation of the scenery, the characters, the magic effects, and of course, the fireworks!!! I also love how they put so much detail into the animation. The only criticism I can give is they botched up some of the animation for the last episode. Other than that, 10/10! \\n\r\nRating: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nMusic/Sound\\n\r\nAgain, it's P.A. Works, so the music is amazing!!! I love both the opening and especially the ending they're so beautiful and soothing to listen to. Mimei no imi to Hakumei no Mahou has become my top 5 songs for this year! The sound effects for magic casting are also great to hear! \\n\r\nRating: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Ah yes the characters. P.A. Works did a pretty good job for the characters. There was just enough character development for each character to make us fall in love with them. I loved how they developed Hitomi's character. I already mentioned it earlier so I'll skip her. Yuito is quite gentle but quite dense. Sho is the big brother character trying to protect and looking out for everyone. Asagi is the little sister character a soft and emotional character. Chigusa is the.... clown of the anime with all the jokes he makes and sometimes the insensitive things he says. Kurumi is probably the most level headed and smartest person out of the bunch? And of course, Kohaku the most cheerful and fun-loving character although she can get serious. I have a hard time choosing which is my favorite character but you know what, I'm gonna do something different and choose Hitomi as my favorite character for the show. \\n\r\nRating: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, my favorite anime for Fall 2018 season and possibly my top 5 anime for this year! I absolutely love Irozuku and I gotta thank P.A. Works for making such a heartwarming anime.\\n\\n\r\nFinal rating: 10/10",

            "content": "I'm glad I paid attention to this one this season, or else I'd have missed out big time.\r\nPros:\r\n- Artwork is absolutely breathtaking from beginning to end.  From the vividly colored magical moments, to the dialed back calmer moments, everything about the artwork complements the story in almost every moment and as a result serves as the main spectacle the series has to offer.  Definitely is a few steps above your typical anime, giving it the quality of many cinematic anime film.\r\n- Characters are very well written.  Even though most people watching don't suffer from the same problem as Hitomi, it is stillhandled very well and the audience can sympathize and understand her character more and more as the series progresses.  Many of the side characters are also just as well written through character arcs sprinkled throughout the series that turn these (at first) one dimensional anime characters into characters you start to understand and feel a connection with\\n\\n\r\n- There are some really interesting and creative plot concepts and visual concepts thrown throughout that add a very unique fantasy twist that make this rise above your standard slice-of-life affair.  Quite often, I found myself comparing these to the likes of many classic Studio Ghibli films.\\n\\n\r\n- Thankfully, P.A. Works did not leave us with a horrible ending (as they are infamous for). \\n\\n\r\n- Sound felt very realistic, and the musical accompaniment serviced the series perfectly.\\n\\n\r\n- While I mostly don't mind series that incorporate violence, harsh language, and fan service into their shows, it's nice to see a series, for once, that avoids all of them and still ends up remaining engaging and well executed on multiple fronts.\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\\n\r\n- While I thought the ending was good, there is one minor nitpick I have with it.  (SPOILER ALERT) There was one scene at the very end showing Hitomi at someone's grave.  It's assumed to be Yuito's, but its so vague that it might not be also.  A quick explanation (like showing the name on the grave) would have been nice. (SPOILER END).\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nWhile I'm sure there are plenty out there, this is the first anime series I've seen that captures a truly cinematic feeling not commonly seen in many anime or TV series in general.  Whether you enjoyed it or not, there's no denying that lots of effort and love went into this project.  For the most part, I think it pays off nicely.  If you love the lush, colorful, artistry of Shinkai Makoto's work integrated with a solid romance/drama anime, and just a tiny bit of Ghibli magic calling back to \"Kiki's Delivery Service\" and \"Spirited Away\", then \"Irozuku: The World Of Colors\" is a no-brainer.  In my opinion, best series of Fall 2018.",

I\u2019m so glad I stumbled upon it and decided to watch it as it left me with a huge impact despite its simpleness\r\nThis anime might not be everyone\u2019s cup of tea. A lot of ppl may have found Hitomi (MC) annoying or boring and what not, but for me, I could genuinely relate to her.\r\nWhile watching her I could see a glimpse of myself back in school days...Does the feeling of loneliness, closing off yourself completely from others, not being able to talk even if you want to and people simply brushing youoff as a shy or weird person rings bell, eh?\\n\r\nIf it does then do give it a watch. You won\u2019t regret it.\\n\\n\r\nHaving people who can truly understand you and accept you for who you are is truly a blessing because it helps not just you but also them to see their weaknesses and grow from it. And this is what the central message of this anime is. \\n\\n\r\nAll the characters are extremely charming.  You just cannot not like any one of them. \\n\r\nAnd they have their own share of problems which is pretty relatable to each one of us \\n\r\nThe elderly people were so nice. It made me feel how nice it must be having grandparents like that because I don\u2019t really have any memories with mine.\\n\r\nMoreover the MC being color blind was really unique as you don\u2019t get to see this kind of a storyline that often. \\n\r\nAlso the story is not at all predictable. One of the main reasons is Ofcourse the time skip, because you never know how the story is going to end whenever time skip is involved.\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of those animes which I can rewatch without getting bored! I really liked it a lot..\\n\\n\r\nJust an additional message from my side, \\n\r\nYou are great as you are...If you don\u2019t get along well with people around you that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re weird or that there\u2019s anything wrong with you. It\u2019s just that you haven\u2019t met the right people meant for you yet...And you will definitely meet them one day! :)",

            "content": "Iroduku is the epitome of all drama and slice of life anime. From the gorgeous art, pleasing soundtracks, and lovable characters, almost everything is perfect. It's a very touching anime with the intention of leaving a good impression with its viewers, teaching them a life lesson that'll change the way they perceive this world. \r\nAnd they successfully pulled it off. \r\n~[Story]~ \r\nThis is the weakest part of this anime. It's still good. I love how the annoying love triangles didn't last long (they handled it really well), fights got resolved quickly (thank God they communicate!), and the long awaited confession scene was greatly executed. Inmy opinion, it's one of the best confession scenes out there. Who would've thought a piece of paper with a little bit of magic will result to one of the sweetest and most romantic scenes of all time? \\n\\n\r\nHowever, just like what I said, it's still the weakest. In some episodes, it just felt flat. It became a bit boring to the point I once thought \"Oh, just get it over with\". I honestly watched an episode in 2x speed because of that. \\n\\n\r\nI understand that they're laying the groundwork and the likes but it gets tiring. This happened around the middle part of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nBut thankfully, during the last parts, oh darn. Things finally picked up. Every episode is a rollercoaster of emotions. So many revelations, pivotal moments, and amazing character developments. Thank God I didn't drop this anime or else I wouldn't discover this precious gem and the priceless value it has. \\n\\n\r\nThey definitely made up for those boring episodes, rewarding its viewers with a thrilling rollercoaster ride filled with emotions and character developments which made everything so worth it and beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nI just wish the ending was a bit better because they left one loose thread but it still tied everything up nicely.\\n\\n\r\nScore: 9/10 \\n\\n\r\n~[Art]~\\n\\n\r\nThe art is very astounding. There are a lot of beautiful backgrounds. I took many screenshots while watching this series. I love how they portrayed the colors, and the black and white scenes. They really added a lot of depth to the whole anime. \\n\\n\r\nPrepare to be amazed especially when the characters use magic. So beautiful. \\n\\n\r\nHowever the character designs, especially the main guy, isn't my favorite. I don't understand how such a beautiful anime could have such a boring character designs. They're very lacklustre and barely complimented the gorgeous backgrounds. But, even with that, I still believe the art of this anime deserves praise. \\n\\n\r\nScore: 10/10\\n\\n\r\n~[Sound]~ \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is the strongest part of this anime. It's very pleasant and has a calming effect. The OSTs are memorable, the ending's great, but the opening beats them all. 17 Sai is one of the best anime openings I've ever heard. When I first listened to the first few seconds of the song, I immediately knew this'd be my fave anime opening of Fall 2018. \\n\\n\r\nThey definitely added more impact to the scene and the creators inserted them at the right moment and shot. This resulted to a very memorable scenes that'll be remembered by its viewers for a long time. \\n\\n\r\nScore: 10/10\\n\\n\r\n~[Character]~\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are relatable and lovable. You'll immediately get immersed into their world and get attached with the people living in it. The main cast is the sort of people I want to meet and be friends with forever. They were a good influence to Hitomi and changed her for the better. \\n\\n\r\nAt the same time, you can tell how much everyone in this show cares for her. Whenever I see scenes depicting this, my heart always swell up with joy, and muttering \"Ahh, thank God. Hitomi's not alone anymore\". \\n\\n\r\nEveryone also had great character development especially the main guy. I'm really proud of him and I'm glad I didn't think ill of him no matter how \"boring\" he may seem. I knew he'll have a great development. Same goes with Hitomi as well. I'm just really happy for her. \\n\\n\r\nOh and Asagi is #bestgirl definitely. I won't give out too much details but let me just say, they really did her character right. \\n\\n\r\nIt breaks my heart to leave them behind but I'll always remember the great things they did for Hitomi and how they made her feel belonged and loved. \\n\\n\r\nScore: 10/10\\n\\n\r\n~[Enjoyment]~\\n\\n\r\nIn this case, enjoyment = times I cried. And that's a lot especially on the last few episodes. Thank God I decided to wait for three weeks and binged them all in one day. \\n\\n\r\nPlus, it didn't help either that I'm a huge crybaby. I was teary eyed for almost thirty minutes on one episode and literally cried for almost an hour while watching the last two episodes because my heart couldn't just take it anymore. \\n\\n\r\nI won't delve too much into the details. Let me just say that make sure there are tissues beside you and prepare for a ride of fluctuating emotions. You can really tell that this show's playing with your heart on purpose. \\n\\n\r\nScore: 10/10\\n\\n\r\n~[Conclusion]~\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Iroduku is a really beautiful and touching anime. This is the type that appeals more to the heart rather than the mind and after watching, it'd leave behind a good impression and a great life lesson. The story's good, the art's gorgeous, the sounds are pleasant, and the characters are memorable. \\n\\n\r\nThey handled a lot of tropes well and did everything related to it right. It's refreshing to see a new take on these clich\u00e9d scenes which made me love this anime even more. The romance was handled really great especially the confession scene. I'll always remember that scene fondly even though it broke my heart at the same time. \\n\\n\r\nSo if you're planning to watch this, prepare tissues and even though it's already obvious how it'd end from episode 1, it's still a great ride that you shouldn't miss out. Once it gets boring, just hang in there. It's only for a few episodes. I promise after that, things would pick up without giving you time to breathe. And most of all, prepare for a touching and bittersweet anime that'll change the way you perceive this world. \\n\\n\r\nAhhh, I'll truly miss this anime. Thank you for the wonderful memories, Iroduku and P.A. Works. \\n\\n\r\nP.S.: This is the first ever anime from P.A. Works I've ever watched. I'm so excited for their future works!\\n",

            "content": "To this day, Kimi ni Todoke remains one of my favorite rom-coms of all time, close to my heart in a way that few other series manage to touch. If I were to designate one reason above all else why it was able to sweep me away so completely, it\u2019s that it takes place in a world that is fundamentally good. Everyone in Kimi ni Todoke is the best person they can possibly be, always ready to reach out a helping hand to guide each other through their troubles. The show\u2019s world feels like a world that actively wants its characters to succeed, and theresult is probably the single most comforting atmosphere in all of anime, a universe that I love diving into and snuggling under like a warm fluffy blanket on a winter\u2019s day. It would be so easy for a show with this much heart on its sleeve to come off as overly saccharine, but thanks to the strength of its stellar cast, its production values, and Sawako herself being one of the smartest written anime protagonists of all time, it never tips into treacle. It\u2019s a beautiful balancing act of warmth and compassion that I\u2019ve never seen pulled off quite as well as it is there.\\n\\n\r\nI bring all this up to say that Iroduku: The World in Colors captures that same essence better than any show since Kimi ni Todoke itself, and the result is probably my favorite show of the Fall 2018 season.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes Iroduku such a fantastic successor to Kimi ni Todoke\u2019s throne of nice people doing nice things is just how well its premise and execution embrace the easy, un-posturing warmth that human interaction can be at its best. The story follows Hitomi, a girl from the future born to a family of witches with an obvious depression metaphor that keeps her from seeing colors. You might think that this concept would be enough to fill an entire world of storytelling possibilities all on its own, but nope; that\u2019s just the set-up for the real story. The actual plot kicks in when Hitomi\u2019s grandmother uses time magic to send her into her own childhood for reasons that aren\u2019t immediately explained in-universe, but on a meta sense are very clearly an attempt to help her granddaughter work through her emotional issues. Thus, Hitomi finds herself transported sixty years into the past- a.k.a. our present- and doing her best to fit into normal life there, going to school, joining a club, connecting with her grandmother\u2019s now-teenage self, and meeting a similarly disaffected boy whose drawings are the one thing she\u2019s able to see in color, all while trying to figure out why her grandmother sent her back in the first place and what she\u2019s supposed to do.\\n\\n\r\nSo yes, the fertile set-up of magic and time travel ends up being the skeleton for a very loose slice-of-life/romance tale, less interested in the mechanics of this unique take on the world and more in the emotional journeys of everyone in the photography and artistry club Hitomi ends up joining. But therein lies the subtle genius at the core of Iroduku\u2019s story; while the mystical and magical elements aren\u2019t the focus, they are still woven into the fabric of the narrative. In this world, magic is commonplace and common knowledge, but not in the sense like Harry Potter where it\u2019s wizards and broomsticks around every corner; here, magic is integrated into life as we know it, not so much altering how the world operates as providing spice and flavor to a very familiar setting. This is a story about a normal group of teenagers living normal teenage lives that just happens to have magic dancing around the edges. It\u2019s a story of a group of photography students who care for each other and want to see each other succeed, of the bonds they share and the bonds they form, of the passion they have for their art and how they use it to prop each other up, and all the while Hitomi and her grandmother are able to provide visual splendor to the emotions everyone\u2019s feeling with a single wave of they improvised Pocky wands.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that\u2019s what I love about this show; it\u2019s magical realism where the magic truly feels real, and reality truly feels magical. If magic actually existed in an otherwise normal interpretation of our universe, this is exactly how I imagine it would be implemented; as something familiar yet exciting, in powders and potions that everyone can use but not everyone can make, creating splashy effects to enhance school projects and demonstrations, a collector\u2019s item for adventurous souls who love to experiment, a recipe one can brew up with patience and time, baked into every subtle facet of these ordinary, extraordinary lives its characters lead. I love watching them use water magic to walk on water for a club presentation like one might use a fog machine. I love watching Hitomi learn to cook up enchanted sand as if it were a real recipe with components that can run dry and a clear process to its creation. I love how alive this world feels, how utterly gorgeous its reflection of reality is. Admittedly, I am the biggest slut in existence for exactly this kind of heartfelt confectionary, ESPECIALLY the pastel rainbow color palette that makes every ray of light feel like it\u2019s been reflected through a million stained glass windows before reaching the earth. But thanks to just how goddamn staggering the production values are (seriously, even in a year with Violet Evergarden this show is remarkable in its beauty) and how warm the character interactions are, it manages to feel truly whimsical, capturing a flee-flying spirit of imagination and wonder that makes the world feel as alive to us as it does to Hitomi as she gradually opens her shell up.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I compare this show heavily to Kimi ni Todoke, it isn\u2019t following that show\u2019s exact framework. Kimi ni Todoke was very focused on character writing, on making each individual player in its world feel as alive and vibrant as humanly possible. It was a show where I could look at each character and recognize them as a fully fleshed-out creation with their own thoughts, feelings, and desires. That\u2019s not the case with Iroduku; no one in this show, except perhaps Hitomi\u2019s wonderfully rambunctious teenage grandmother, is complex or memorable enough to carry the story on their own. The strength of this cast comes from their interactions and how their warmth all feeds into each other, which explains why the first and last episodes, in which Hitomi has alternatively not yet formed those connections and is leaving them behind, are easily and unfortunately the weakest episodes of the show. The character writing just isn\u2019t strong enough to support them on their own. Thankfully, it makes up the slack with its situation writing: when Iroduku\u2019s characters talk, they feel like real people having real conversations about real issues, like I could step through the screen and join right in with them. What helps capture this feeling of naturalism is that the dialogue writing is very good at saying just as much as it needs to and nothing more. The characters will occasionally speak in emotional exposition, laying out the groundwork of their emotional states, but it never goes so far as to spell out the conclusions you\u2019re supposed to reach. It just lets these characters reveal as much as they need to, and leaves the unspoken end result of those conversations to hover in the air, providing texture to every single time these character interact from then on.\\n\\n\r\nAnd nowhere is this clearer than in a handful of utterly breathtaking scenes that are too spoilery to properly explore in full. To speak without giving away the game, there are moments where Hitomi\u2019s magic takes her into the color-filled drawings of the aforementioned artist boy, and if you know anything about art in fiction, it shouldn\u2019t be a surprise that these moments end up delving deep into these characters\u2019 psyches with metaphor and symbolism bubbling from the depths of this crayola-sketched world. But what truly makes them such a experience is that these metaphors are allowed to play themselves out in silence. The precise details of what\u2019s going on in these surreal sequences don\u2019t matter; what matters is the feeling they evoke. Which means you\u2019re allowed to watch these abstract, almost avant-garde expressions of feeling just wash over you, getting you into the characters\u2019 emotional headspaces better than any expositional dialogue would do. And it\u2019s really goddamn powerful. I had to remind myself to breathe at several points, I was so entranced by the unspoken story playing out in front of me. It\u2019s only once the magic is over and the characters have returned to their world that we get some context into what emotions and experiences formed the basis of all those metaphors, and once again, we\u2019re only given just enough to \u201cget it\u201d without spoiling the mystique of the event itself. If for nothing else, you should watch Iroduku just for those few sequences; they\u2019re really a sight to behold.\\n\\n\r\nBut in reality, you should watch Iroduku for so much more. You should watch it for its utterly gorgeous depiction of a world just a colorful hop removed from our own. You should watch it for the warmth of its cast and their immensely fun interactions. You should watch it for the timelessness of its reality, and the engrossing whimsy of it magic. And you should watch it for its poignant, affecting story of depression, hope, and learning to see color in a world of black and while. Iroduku: The World in Colors is a gorgeous feast for all senses, including the most important one: the heart.",

            "content": "Perfect marks all the way across the board.  Not to often do you run into a piece of media that you cant find some sort of grievance with. Irozuku was truly worth waiting every week for.  The summary for the show lets you know there will be just a hint of magic involved,  but  this blend of slice of life  and out of the norm concepts isn't forced or unbalanced at all.  I do believe almost everyone will be able to settle in for this 12 episode adventure andwalk away having been entertained.  \\n\\n\r\n             The story is really easy to follow as its very generous with in the moment intention, and not heavy in misdirection.   Shows often rely on cliffhangers to keep the viewer interested.  While I cant say there are none in Irozuku,  I can say this story often gives some form of satisfying revelation to build excitement at the end of each episode,  making it okay to take a break and reflect on the story. That format definitely helped me appreciate it as I spent more time thinking about what had just happened,  and not guessing at what I should be expecting.   The foundation of Irozuku is a coming out of my shell type fable focused on the main character, Hitomi.  The environment around Hitomi is full of her new found friends and family that all develop and contribute in their own way. Even with the stage being shared by so many individuals, I never once felt like I was taking a break from one character to focus on another. The coexistence between the main and supporting characters was flawlessly laid out.  Nothing felt gratuitous and everyone and everything had a purpose.  Some laughs, some tears,  but over all very well done.\\n\\n\r\n                        VISUALLY PLEASING,     If the quality of this animation becomes the new standard of Anime, then we have a bright future as viewers of this already wonderful media format.  Not only is this show a treat for the eyes, but the art and quality of Irozuku play a huge role in telling this story.  Had the quality of animation or even just scenery choices been any different,  the story itself would have had a difficult time being as mesmerizing as it is.  The  music selections and environmental noises in this show even seem to follow the animation in an odd but magical sort of way.  As apposed to the norm of music being used to set the mood, it feels like the mood sets the music.  That the jingles and sounds themselves couldn't play with out the story starting them up.  Confusing,  but I mean to say,  the music was less of an added enhancement and felt more like it just belonged.  \\n\\n\r\n                        As a fan of many genres of anime,  you find yourself recognizing many tropes.  I absolutely love the fact that the characters of Irozuku seem almost trope-less, and more like individuals.  Their involvement and reactions to the ongoing world around them are so genuine you will find it hard to pick favorites.   This is even so more amazing given the special circumstances governing select characters in this story.  Especially the ones tied into the magic aspect of this slice of life type drama.\\n\\n\r\n                 Start to finish Irozuku is a completed story, and this might have some viewers wanting for a different ending or thinking \"what if\".   Not saying you wont be completely satisfied, but the whole story will have you trying to work out a way for this amazing fable to continue on.   All in all your bearded pal Grizzziff gives Irozuku a 10/10. I highly recommend this experience.",

            "content": "This anime falls within the slow paced drama genres with some magic to spice things up, if you have watched 5cm per second, just because or your name then you have already essentially experienced all there is to this anime but the other shows did it better. So why bother watching? For the characters naturally and sadly this show fails horribly at it but to make this consistent I will express my views on the characters, story and then finally the art.\r\nCharacters(Hitomi *Spoilers*)\r\nThe characters in this show are so weak it is sad, our main character Hitomi to be blunt is stale, listless and easilyforgettable. She has lost her sense of color since she was a child for an unknown reason, doesn't like magic cause reasons and therefore is anti-social and shy cause reasons. She most have had the worst childhood ever for her to be so negative just because she can't see colours, she doesn't talk to anyone at all clearly because in ep 2 she goes on about how no one has every said they want to see her magic or \\n\r\nhow it can make someone happy. This show also loves forcing drama down your throat making any tension painful unnatural or outright stupid. Example: ep2 she finally says she wants to see Shou's art, hooray finally wasn't so hard was it? Why was there even tension for such a simple question? When she sees it nothing happens end of issue. Yup that is it, queue credits lol. I find her genuinely frustrating, she is a character that is portrayed as some victim (Thanks to Shou and grandma) who is innocent but she is very much incompetent and self pitying. However, because I need to say what I like about this show, in terms of Hitomi I like how she is pretty, thanks P.A Works.\\n\\n\r\nShou is a typical edgy guy who is considered a loner but has a few close friends. Yet he must still be a edgy loner and uptight about everything apparently so he is I'll say mean to the obviously introverted Hitomi. Don't worry though they say opposites attract, he'll probably have some back story as to why he has got to be negative all the time.\\n\\n\r\nSupporting characters are all cliche. Wow that was quick guess the root of this show's issues are the two main characters surprise surprise.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nWe all know the story, if not read the summary. It is nothing special with only Hitomi's progression driving it which is a shame because I don't call asking a question then getting happy over someone saying something nice to you about the thing you hate progression. Well we are on ep 2 so fingers crossed this show can actually turn out to be good.\\n\\n\r\nEdit: Hello, here from the future at ep 4, nothing has changed. It is so pathetic that I didn't even need to change my review I wrote from ep 2!\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nAbsolutely fantastic. The visuals are great and the show is pure eye candy. The only issue is that Hitomi seems to be permanently blushing for some reason... In-fact make that all the females hmmm.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict: This show is average if you can look past the terrible characters. If you are like me and can't stand them it is simply bad, cringey and even frustrating to watch which is a huge shame because I'm a huge romance fan.",

            "content": "Watching Irozuku Sekai no Ashita kara (Iroduku) is like a taking a journey into a storybook adventure. But in that adventure, there\u2019s magic, creativity, and feelings that\u2019s hard to be put into words alone. Produced by P.A. Works, I had high expectations for Iroduku considering their recent lineup. Being a powerhouse studio, P.A. Works has always captivated me with their wealth of ideas. From school life dramas to a dark thriller about vampires, this studio continues to establish themselves with their creativity.\r\nTo my delight, Iroduku turned out to be yet another show that made me realize how an original anime should be done. Believe me,this seemed like a hit or miss in the beginning that looked like an average modern teen soap opera. However, I would say not to judge too fast as the premise itself possesses great potential for a storyteller. From the beginning, we are introduced to the city of Nagasaki where magic is also part of normal life. We meet main female protagonist Hitomi Tsukishiro who happens to be a 17 year old descendant from a family of witches. What we know about her early on is that she has a disdain towards magic. It\u2019s because she lost her sense with colors and also became distant with people. The plot involves her grandmother Kohaku who decides to send her 60 years into the past so they can reconnect. To be honest, this show became a modern fantasy about self-discovery even with the time travel gimmick. At the center of it is Hitomi Tsukishiro.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll say right off the bat that the show will test a bit of the audience\u2019s patience. The pacing in the beginning is slow and doesn\u2019t jump over itself to sell its core concepts. But that\u2019s not really a negative of the show. I came to realize that the directors wanted to help the characters grow especially with important relationships. From the first few episodes, it\u2019s shown that Hitomi is not a sociable person and finds it difficult to open herself to others. That soon changes when she meets Yuito Aoi and the photography club. Through their influence, Hitomi begins to climb out of her shell. For some reason, Hitomi is also able to see Yuito\u2019s colors in his drawings. This is important as it enables the both of them to connect on a more personal level.\\n\\n\r\nIndeed, Iroduku shines best when it\u2019s able to capitalize on the character relationship development. Hitomi and Yuito is a prominent example. The show commits to developing their relationship from strangers to close friends. It felt like the creators wanted us to experience both of their character growth alongside them. Significantly enough, Hitomi does develop from a withdrawn witch girl into a more mature woman. This is thanks to the positive influence of Kohaku Tsukishiro, who also joins the Photography Club later on. What I find interesting about Kohaku is her outgoing personality and loyalty to her friends. From the beginning, she seems like the opposite of Hitomi and is easily open to others. At the same time, she\u2019s also a bit of a troublemaker for her experiments with magic at school. While I can\u2019t say she is a flawless character, Kohaku brings in a lot of hope for character development. Hitomi begins to regain her sense of magic but also able to make new friends. It\u2019s a very simple and acceptable way to see her character growth. \\n\\n\r\nNow you may be questioning yourself if this show contains romance as part of its storytelling. While the show itself isn\u2019t adamant on building romance, it does exist in some ways. As the story progresses, it seems Hitomi develops some feelings towards Yuito and vice versa. Their photography club president Shou Yamabuki also begins to show an attraction towards Hitomi. Meanwhile, there\u2019s Asagi Kazeno in the club who has an obvious crush towards Shou. You get the idea. Not to mention, misunderstandings ensue early in the series when Kurumi (vice president of the photography club) took a video of Hitomi coming out of Yuito\u2019s room. Romance angles exist in the show but really doesn\u2019t overshadow the story\u2019s flow. P.A. Works have been known to make anime with romance content that can get be stale and overly sensitive. Thankfully, Iroduku isn\u2019t the case even though it exists.\\n\\n\r\nStill, the big question to ask yourself is what\u2019s the most you can get out of this show? At best, this show works in wonders as a character driven story with a creative modern fantasy atmosphere. Every character in the show brings something to the table for their role. The show\u2019s main push though is Hitomi for her character growth and self-discovery. Whether you like it or not, the story focuses on her growing with more self-confidence and plays a central part in regaining her sense of magic. She even gets on better terms with characters like Asagi after the two understands each other more. Meanwhile, we also get some unique symbolisms. The most prominent one is the golden fish that symbolizes hope. Not only does Hitomi finds her own world now, she also grows to accept magic. This is also thanks to Kohaku\u2019s presence as she wants to make her granddaughter happy. Magic plays a role and she wants Hitomi to experience the best out of it. As you may expect, the show also contains time travels tropes. But really, this isn\u2019t a show about fixing the past but rather about changing a character in a positive way. I\u2019m probably going easy on this show in some ways but everything felt like it flows so well from start to finish. From Hitomi joining the photography club to experiencing cultural festival together with friends, P.A. Works manages to sell this series as a modern coming of age fantasy.\\n\\n\r\nEven if this show isn\u2019t your cup of tea for its drama, the technical content is a feast for the eyes. P.A. Works once again manages to showcase their talent with high level production quality. It\u2019s very well polished that makes the show itself look like a work of art. It\u2019s easy to also accept the show as a modern fantasy with the relaxing setting and lush backgrounds. Magic itself is portrayed in aesthetic style with blending of unique colors. As it\u2019s part of the plot, the show\u2019s visuals manages to capture the essence of that at its finest. My only pet peeve is the character expressions. An easy finger to point at is Hitomi for having the same face for the majority of the show. I get the creators wanted to portray her as a withdrawn girl in the beginning but it\u2019s hard to sometimes feel empathic about her on the surface. This is a contrast to pretty much almost every other character. As you may also expect, this show is very melancholic especially during some of the more emotional episodes. The theme songs reflects that as well along with voice mannerism in those cases.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s probably countless ways to accept this show but the simplest way is to embrace the character growth of the main protagonist, Hitomi. My initial impression of the show grew from a story about magic to how characters can change thanks to others\u2019 influence. Character relationships play a big role for its ability to capture the significance of their growth. Once again, P.A. Works shows how valuable their original anime can be. And to me, I can\u2019t help but recommend Iroduku for those who wants to experience more.",

            "content": "'With fewer colors, you might come to understand some important things. '\r\nIf you were given the chance to use magic, what will you do? Irozuku Sekai no Ashita kara, aka The World in Colors, is truly a beautiful show on the levels of Violet Evergarden and some films as well. But what breathes color into the show itself is the story, directed by Toshiya Shinohara, I have high hopes for this original written anime, and thus far it has been delivering quite well. Without further ado, lets dive right into this review. \r\nStory / Character   -9.5-\r\nSet in a world sixty years from now,people living in the future have been utilizing magic to ease up their life. However, our female protagonist Hitomi hates magic. The beautiful colors everyone sees turns monochrome for her, nothing enlightens her and she seems to have no friends. Her grandmother, Kohaku, knowing well of Hitomi's situation, decides to send her sixty years back to meet her younger self, in hopes of helping Hitomi to overcome the situation. After some strange interactions, Hitomi finds herself in a stranger's house, and escapes from it. A few encounters later she starts making friends and has found her grandmother and even her great grandmother, albeit at that time they might as well just be their sister and mother. However strangely enough, she notices she has dropped her important azurite, an equipment (?) from the future, and sets out to look for it. Coincidentally, it was dropped on the stranger's house, whom she found was drawing. As she approaches him, she saw colors that she has never seen for ages starting to come in life surrounding her. But when Yuito, the stranger himself stops her, the world goes back to monochromatic. \\n\r\nWith all these being said, this original story has a lot going for it at this point, the world building and the characters are very likable, and what enhances it by a LARGE MARGIN would be the art that im going to talk about next.\\n\\n\r\nArt   -10-\\n\r\nPA Works just outdone themselves, this show looks literally like cocaine but for your eyes. The background art is literally one of the best you can find in anime, the usage of colors and some indeed very unique camera angle really makes this show stand out from the rest this season. Character animations are very fluid and looks natural. Absolutely one of the best looking anime overall. \\n\\n\r\nSound   -10-\\n\r\nAs much as I want to give more credits to the voice acting on this show, what really steals the show is the OST, Opening and Ending. From the first episode I was already blown away from the soundtrack. The OST used are almost certainly beautiful, just as the show itself is. And as aforementioned, the OP/ED really isnt something I cant find myself ever skipping on, not only they look good, which Ive already strongly emphasized, but the song itself is, too, very impressive, especially the ED by Nagi Yanagi, one of my favourite artist. \\n\\n\r\nOverall   -10-\\n\r\nIf you are still wondering what you should be watching for this season, this show has got you covered good. With an interesting premise this show I have really high hopes for, and I personally can see this show ending with a lot of ninjas cutting onions behind the scenes. As someone who draws, this show is like a godsend for those who appreciates art. By all means, I really hope this show gets to more people with this humble review as I feel as of now this show is seemingly unappreciated.   \\n\\n",

Therefore, she travels back in time to join a school club in the past, falls in love with a teenager of her age and starts seeing colors again because feelings and happiness (assumably). Unicorns, rainbows and other nice stuff exist in the time where everything was better. Literally rainbows, not the meme. This is pretty much the stupidest reason I have heard for a time traveling story andthe content surely is not making it any better. It's practically every school club thingie ever done except its selling point are the magic and time traveling stuff that simply exist and nothing more, so basically, there is no selling point.\\n\\n\r\nThe mc is simply awful, and has the personality of a suicidal toddler. y tho? Because she stops crying about her angsty side the second someone throws a goddamn magic toy at her. Her very existence is annoying and whenever she does anything or just is there, her whole presence is yelling \"I am about to kill myself\" but her pathetic personality quietly whispering \"I can't do it.\" I paused the video first time in ep 1 at time stamp 7:30 and spend 5 minutes staring at her face that looked like this =( just to try and understand -- to figure out -- what is the point of her character. Why was this series made with some sort of pseudo-sad and borderline emo manner that is too bland and boring to be edgy and too stupid for me to give a damn about anything that she might or might not be feeling. \\n\\n\r\nThe time travelling concept itself is chaotically random to begin with. Grandma gives a hug and sends our mc in the year 2018 with nothing but a talking earring and a map with her. Good thing she happens to end up in just the right place and get instantly surrounded by characters who all seem to love her and not see what an uninteresting and sad person she is. Basically she is just a transfer student but for some reason, the series needed to be seasoned with some extra messy because -- well -- it can be done. Cool. The character development on the other hand makes no sense at all. Why couldn't this grill talk with people in her own timeline and stop being a lil bitch there? -- why this is possible in the current year but not in the original angsty timeline is beyond me. \\n\\n\r\nThe side characters and production all are decent, no problems there -- I would even praise the art if I thought it mattered -- but this thing is sucking because of the main lead is... this character and the series' excuse to even exist is beyond lame.  \\n\\n\r\nThe only way I have been able to enjoy this thing at all is laughing at scenes such as our mc trying to open windows or asking people \"what is a band-aid?\" I like to imagine that she doesn't know these things not because she is from the future where they don't apparently exist, but because she is so fucking stupid.",

            "content": "I feel that it\u2019s safe to say that all stories in some essence are contrived. I mean these are works of fiction, fake stories concocted by a writer/s imagination.  From characters, settings, plot conventions, conveniences, and  anything else under the sun, the writer has full control to manipulate them however they wish. Of course this is only looking at a work in a very reductionist point of view.  Because even if they are contrived, most don\u2019t give off the air or feel of being one. Due to the fact of the creators embellishing their stories that makes their characters more compelling, thesettings having a sense of place, and for the plot to come off as more \u201cnaturel\u201d. Why is all this important?  Well because Irozuku seems to be in conflict with two different elements, with one being the tale of self growth as a character and the other being a magical time travel romantic melodrama. \\n\\n\r\nFrom the start off it\u2019s easy to see that there was a good amount of effort put into the visuals of the show. With a show with the name color in its name, it does make sure to bring it to the screen with a vibrant color pallet being applied to almost everything. However sometimes the vibrancy doesn\u2019t work in it\u2019s favor when it comes to the characters as they come of as glossy making them at time look a bit plastic like. What also doesn\u2019t help for their characters is their designs, at least their faces. While i\u2019m kind of fine with most shows and their minimalist design of the faces this show takes a it a small step more that ends up being to far. With the nose being far to small, and thanks to the glossy look of the show almost non-existent, and that could also play in part with now the eyes looking a bit far apart from the face that they start to look like fish people. \\n\\n\r\nAnyway the main story is about Hitomi, a girl from the future, where magic is commonplace and not the type where technology is advance that it\u2019s like magic, but actual magic. Due to her very strained relationship with her mother, she has lost the color in her life. I don\u2019t mean in a metaphorically melancholic way, but she has honestly become monochromatic colorblind. Then her grandmother comes and has some inkling of how her granddaughter feels and then she just sends her to the past, after which this series of events happen. Hitomi wakes up in some guys empty room, she \u201csecretly\u201d leaves but forgets her earing, she is seen by some people who happen to be the friends of the guy living in the room, she realizes she lost her earring, she finds the guy who lived in that room with her earing, and finally the guys drawing are the only thing that Hitomi can see in color, and mind you that this is just the first episode. It\u2019s not all the small conveniences that are the problem, but how they constantly stack up on one another that makes them so forced and so contrived. Events like these happen every once in a while in the show, and across multiple episodes that it is easy to be taken out of the experience that it is trying to sell. \\n\\n\r\nNow i\u2019m not going to get into the whole time travel thing since that\u2019s a whole beast i don\u2019t care enough to go into it, other than it\u2019s just kind of dumb. The magic i don\u2019t mind as much and i\u2019m fine having it be somewhat ambiguous. However it\u2019s obvious how these are used as plot devices and probably the main vehicle why so many parts of the story just feel so forced. \\n\\n\r\nIt just leaves lingering questions of why the creators of this work would go to such lengths to create such extraneous plot lines for a show about personal growth. Sure this is an anime original and it was trying to be original in its premise from other derivative Japanese high school anime. But that\u2019s just how far they went, only the premise. Since outside of the whole magic and time travel thing all that\u2019s left is a dull school romantic melodrama. None of which are bad elements but the show does nothing to make them work in its favor. There\u2019s not much about the romance that makes it really endearing or compelling. Especially with how all the characters are \u201ccoupled up\u201d  with the main couple, the childhood friends, and the other two. None of them are in actual relationships with each other but the show still makes a point to make it overtly obvious. Even when there\u2019s romantic conflicts which make up most of the melodrama portion. Most of it is just eye rolling and annoying and makes me internally scream, \"get on with it already\"! These problems probably had more to do with the characters themselves. There\u2019s not really much to them when it goes to characterization and personality since it\u2019s rather basic and on the surface and the few who do have some character development, it\u2019s also rather basic and isn\u2019t really that well done. There\u2019s not much about them that makes them really compelling. Even the main character and her developing from her angst into a better person in end is still a dull character. \\n\\n\r\nNow the whole show isn\u2019t that bad. The theme of self growth is rather consistent across the show and it does have moments that are rather good and touching. It even hits a really good stride during the last two or three episodes, even if it\u2019s undermined by more plot contrivance. The production value is fine even if there are some poor decisions with the directing of the show like when it the POV of Hitomi but from her perspective she can still see color and then a few seconds later it turns to monochrome to make a point that she\u2019s color blind in case it wasn\u2019t obvious enough times. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end there\u2019s not much that is worthwhile about this show. With a cast of just boring 2-dimensional characters. A plot that could have gone down a more simpler road while still maintaining it\u2019s core theme, but opted for a more convoluted yet easily convenient one. There\u2019s not much that hides the intrinsic contrivances of the story. Maybe the show should have upped the plastic look of the characters so the writing could have something to match with.\\n",

            "content": "I think, and I believe that this anime has a lot of potential, and needs its improvements in different ways. \r\n(This review contains light spoilers.)\r\nStory: 8\r\nThe story could be better, but I was hoping for the main character to not be so clueless, I mean, she did come from a different world not knowing as much, I think she could've been improved if she was just a normal human being that looks up upon her life as a whole. I'm not saying that it's bad, or it's just downright stupid. I'm saying this like how I reflect upon the story, and how much I wouldlove to reflect upon it many more times. This show has tons of potential, and I think that there is very little for them to improve on. I feel like they should've made Hitomi teleport somewhere else instead of the dudes house. Don't you think that's a little bit weird? (Yuito)\\n\r\n(Hitomi is waifu quality, and she can be. am i right or am i wrong?) \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\\n\r\nWow, never have I seen such exquisite art on my laptop screen. This kind of art is something that they were very dedicated by putting together a sequential series, or perhaps a showcase of very many talented artists in one show. After watching the first few episodes, I believe that this anime makes very flawless art in many different aspects that I could never ever imagine of as myself, a human being. (or filthy weeb trash.) Getting to the point, the abstract art that you've seen today, which is from this anime, is something to behold and to get together with your friends, eating popcorn as you stare in awe of this stupendous art. \\n\r\n(Maybe I'm saying too much?)\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\\n\r\nI love the opening theme song so much, and I think that makes me think about how it would better if Yuito were to be drawing the whole entire opening and ending as time flows in the full opening track. The ending as well could well, made from magic from Hitomi. Although she isn't a professional at magic, I think she would have the courage to do that and impress the others that watch the anime. The ending theme song makes me sad, and the sadness I feel is the happiness that gives me to enjoy the anime. I hope for this anime to make more better music. If you haven't listened to the full OP, then I highly suggest it. Also, be the one weeb that downloads and saves it to their library for the next 5 years. (that's me)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\\n\r\nHitomi is just a weird ass girl that doesn't know much about reality. She makes magic out of thin air, trying to impress Yuito. (Let's be real here, she is a waifu, and I think that every waifu is cute when they're just dumb out of their mind.)\\n\\n\r\nYuito should've went home earlier, and made sure Hitomi was safe and sound in her house to carry out his  \"deeds.\" (\u02f5 \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0\u02f5)\\n\\n\r\nKohaku is just another waifu that needs to be noticed in the anime. (waifus are deliciou- i mean what?)\\n\\n\r\nAll of the characters are just side characters. You don't need to worry about them rather than Yuito and Hitomi. (I ship them so hard. But I hope this won't be like there's romance on the last episode cause that's pretty dumb if you ask me.)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI was stumbling upon the fall anime list and saw this. I thought this would have a male lead, but it's always nice to have a woman as beautiful as Hitomi lead the show as the female lead. Though, I thought it was pretty tragic for her grandmother to cast her away from her, to a whole new parallel world, or maybe was it just on the other side of world? Who knows? But getting to the important part, I was just sitting down in my chair with my laptop open. I was watching this. Never have I regretted saying: \"This show is gonna be terrible.\" Even though a show like this will amaze you by how talented the art that they show us, is something that we should be praising for. I have high hopes for this anime to improve as time passes by. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\nI gotta admit, for a show this high for my ratings is something I would just wish for more episodes by going on my knees, crying and begging for more seasons as the future comes by. But you know the drill, once new anime has been aired, you know to not get so sad about something that's just on a screen. This is no more than just an ordinary screen, it's beautiful art in the making. I hope for the best for this anime! \\n",

            "content": "SOME SPOILERS PRESENT BELOW\r\nIrozuku is a show that tries to mask its lack of plot and even remotely good characters with nice colors. That's really about it. It's reminiscent of Violet Evergarden as to how it tries to ride off of its art, except Evergarden doesn't have a pathetic cast of characters and a boring plot.\r\nStory (5/10): For some reason, this show isn't listed as a Slice of Life, which is very strange, considering the plot is much more boring than your average Slice of Life. Honestly, there really isn't a story. They're in their club, they take pictures, and something about the main girlbeing semi-colorblind. It's basically a Slice of Life without the tag. Then, lo and behold, in the last 3 episodes or so, drama drops out of nowhere straight onto your head, most likely giving you a concussion. Remember guys, drama means sad, and sad means good. That seems to be the golden rule of MAL users. Sad = good. But how am I supposed to feel sad when the characters are as well written as a fourth grader's spelling test?\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (1/10): When you've got pretty much no plot for most of the show, you end up focusing on the characters. When your characters have effectively no defining character traits or personalities, well, you've got a problem. I still don't remember half of the characters' names after finishing the show. Well, sure, the characters might be boring, but you still have character development to make things interesting, right? Well, no, you don't. Unless you count \"this character likes that character\" as conflict/character development, there is literally no character development until the last 3 episodes, where pretty much everything just takes a left turn. Now those plastic bottle characters from the last 10 episodes you watched are in a sad situation, so you have to feel sad. Just try to forget that they literally barely qualified as characters for the past 10 episodes. It's pretty amazing that P.A. Works managed to create a worse cast of characters than that of Ch\u00e4oS;HEAd. There's 2 even remotely decent characters, and one of them is comic relief. I'll just rate the characters individually on a scale of 0 to 5 below.\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nHitomi (0/5): The only feature of her personality is that she can't see colors. Yukiteru Amano probably has more going for him.\\n\\n\r\nMain guy (1/5): Generic edgy loner\\n\\n\r\nClub president (0/5): I don't even know what to put here. He actually just doesn't have any character traits whatsoever. The epitome of a worthless supporting character. Somehow him falling in love with Hitomi was supposed to be a character trait.\\n\\n\r\nChigusa (2/5): Kinda serves as comic relief sometimes?\\n\\n\r\nGlasses girl (1/5): Really just only there for the same repeated fights with Chigusa, kinda got boring after the first time that happened.\\n\\n\r\nAsagi (1/5): She's cute, and she likes taking pictures of cute things. What a greatly defined character. Oh yeah, she likes the club president guy. There appears to be some sort of trend here, where the characters are defined not by themselves, but by who they like, or by the story.\\n\\n\r\nKohaku (3/5): Has more personality than pretty much the rest of the cast combined. She's actually not dead inside! Whenever anything remotely interesting happens, it's usually centered around her magic.\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10): Hey look it's the good part of the show. Everyone knows art is the most important part of a show! Seriously though, the art is beautiful. Amazing color variety/combinations. The scenes where magic is used are absolutely breathtaking. The only reason it doesn't pull a 10/10 is that there are random close-ups of characters' faces in semi-profile views where their nose is just completely off-center. Really bothers me when the whole screen is a character's messed up face. What are their noses doing on their cheeks?\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10): Generic OST with nothing outstanding. Above average opening theme. I've never listened to an ending theme in my life. The music is simple, and it works well for the kind of show that it is. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (4/10): The only show that I watched this season where I didn't feel the desire to watch it on the day it airs. Hell, I even watched Tokyo Ghoul every Tuesday, even though :re 2 is an absolute disgrace. I don't hate the show though. Somehow the art makes this somewhat slightly enjoyable if you don't think hard about it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (4/10): Do you like getting hit over the head with the exact same conflict? Do you have 25 minutes to just completely waste? Do you have some form of ADHD that prevents you from paying attention to what's actually unfolding in front of your eyes? Do you enjoy having a block of drama concrete dropped onto your head? If you answered yes to any 2 out of 4 of these questions, you'll probably enjoy the show. If you didn't, there's plenty of better things to do with your time than watch this.",

I don't even need to mention the art, cause anyone can see that it is truly a masterpiece. One of the most aesthetically pleasing anime I've ever seen! Just the art itself makes me wanna cry.\r\nI've enjoyed every second of every episode so far, always thinking in the back of my mind that I really don't want this anime to end... The story isso full of meaning, love, friendship, self confidence, and growing up issues. Wow I sound so cringe. But this show really got to me, you know.\\n\\n\r\nEvery character seems so genuine and passionate. Hitomi had to go to the past to be able to find and express her true self. She finally opened up and saw herself surrounded by friends. Yet she is meant to be living 60 years in the future, when all of those people are already much older and have already lived most of their lives. Hitomi felt wanted for the first time in her life, however she has to choose between staying there or going back to the future, where her life's meant to be lived.\\n\\n\r\nI've been preparing myself for all the tears that are about to come with this show's ending, but I don't think I'm ready for it at all. I just keep wondering on what's gonna happen if she stays and what's gonna happen if she goes back. Their lives are gonna be forever changed, and I'm so here to see it all.\\n\\n\r\nBeautiful anime, please watch it and cry with me.\\n",

            "content": "Alright P.A. Works, what've you got up your sleeve this time?\u00a0 Let's see...can't see colors; she's colorblind, that's kinda interesting.\u00a0 Magic, sent back in time...ok, a time traveling series.\u00a0 Could pose some problems, but I'm sure it won't bite them in the ass.\u00a0 Hopefully.\u00a0 Shinohara Toshiya as the series director.\u00a0 Why does that name sound familiar?\u00a0 Director of...NagiAsu?\u00a0 Oh goddamnit.\r\nStory:\r\nIn a version of Japan where magic is prominent, Tsukishiro Hitomi watches from afar at fireworks that she used to watch with her mother, only to see black and white.\u00a0 All color is lost in her vision, and the world she lives in exists in anashen gray.\u00a0 Her grandmother, Kohaku, comes up to her and really without word or warning, sends her granddaughter back in time to the time when she was a student sixty years in the past.\u00a0 It's here where Hitomi is forced upon an older world in hopes to help her and with the help of her grandmother's younger self, restore color to her granddaughter's world.\\n\\n\r\nThe mantra of P.A. Works and the company's main selling point are the original works they manage to pump out each year, hardly doing any actual adaptations of light novels or manga in favor of original stories.\u00a0 Irozuku appears as the latest in the company's lineup with some very mixed results.\u00a0\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nThe story focuses on Hitomi and her journey to break out of her shell, capitalizing on the themes on how important people are in our lives and that as long as you have someone close to you, you're never alone.\u00a0 A simple plot with enough punch and potential to grant the viewer an emotional and powerful journey when done well.\u00a0 But this is kind of the fault line where Irozuku borders on 'has potential' and 'wasted potential'.\u00a0 The setup with a group of friends of mixed genders almost always has some kind of romantic subplot going in the background, which given the director's history of NagiAsu was assuredly guaranteed.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nWhile Hitomi is certainly at the forefront of the majority of the story, what ends up being a lacking component is how the rest of the characters around her are formulated as characters.\u00a0 The story lumps up every one or two of her friends together for a character arc, showcasing their respective ups and downs in their personalities to Hitomi so that ultimately everyone grows as people.\u00a0 Issue here is how uneventful everything feels.\u00a0 The show never seems to reach a true emotional high point that makes it possible for me to give a damn, instead choosing to have several smaller bumps that little amount to a few shed tears instead of true emotional breakdown, a shame considering the validity of one given some of the cast's problems.\u00a0 This problem ends up bleeding into Hitomi as well since while yes she does have significant change, it feels subtle enough to almost not matter, had it not been for the ending giving us a proper epilogue to the entire story.\\n\\n\r\nRomantic subplots also plague this story (and many other of P.A.'s works), resulting in an expected, yet also very lukewarm result.\u00a0 I don't understand why they thought that having a romance in a story where a girl is sent back 60 years in the past only to assuredly go back by the end was a good idea to begin with.\u00a0 Honestly, the show could've just not made it so that there was any romance between the characters and it would almost assuredly have the same impact.\u00a0 I actually feel like the show was constricting itself with it because it's like \"Oh, we HAVE to have this tragic romance where they can't be together for tension\" instead of just having the entire group just be really good friends.\u00a0 The fact that it doesn't really go anywhere either does make it a harmless add-in, but also raises the question of what the point of having romance was to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nStory-wise, the show's only true, major upside lies in its ending where everything is wrapped in a neat bow, glorifying the journey as an emotional rollercoaster of emotions.\u00a0 The embellishment is kind of unreal for a good majority of the meandering that happens in the plot, but it serves to give the story a satisfying conclusion that it otherwise wouldn't have given the fact that it puts Hitomi's entire character arc into perspective.\u00a0 It's probably the only aspect of the story that I like, which if nothing else, gives me hope that 'Hey, at least P.A. can do endings now'.\u00a0\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nHitomi herself is a depressing character, moping around for a majority of the plot due to her shy and walled-off nature where she's afraid to inconvenience people, hates her existence as a mage, and bears the burden of the conflict that she had with her mother.\u00a0 Despite a potential breeding ground for growth, ultimately I don't really like Hitomi as a character.\u00a0 It never feels like she's truly at the forefront of the story despite all of the other characters making her so.\u00a0 She definitely has her moments in the spotlight where she does take initiative and acts on her own accord to not only better herself and hone in her qualities as a mage, but the majority of her character just doesn't feel like she does anything meaningful due to her innately shy and soft-spoken nature.\u00a0\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nKohaku is the only other character that I feel has any real moments in the spotlight.\u00a0 As Hitomi's grandmother de-aged sixty years, Kohaku serves as the spunky and outspoken character who loves magic, the complete opposite to her granddaughter.\u00a0 While Kohaku doesn't really get a character arc herself, a lot of what she does serves to make the plot happen, showing us the amount of work she puts in to better herself as a mage and takes responsibility of what her older self has done.\u00a0\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast suffers from honestly, not being all that memorable.\u00a0 Chigusa, Sho, Kurumi, and Asagi all have their moments in the spotlight, but never to the point where their existence is validated enough beyond a part of the whole that is the 'group'.\u00a0 Their respective claims to fame exist for maybe an episode or two at the most, which I feel is a shame considering the potential for this show.\u00a0 The only standout character of 'The Group' is Aoi Yuito, an aspiring artist who while has a character arc in line with Hitomi, also suffers the same problems as her being that his innate character traits restrict the potential that he has.\u00a0 Romantic subplot also makes his growth feel a lot less genuine than it could've been.\u00a0\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nIf there's at least one thing that I love from P.A. Works, it's just how much they love their artwork.\u00a0 At least for a majority of their projects.\u00a0 Characters are drawn in the signature P.A. style with a bit more care put into them compared to Kuromukuro or Shirobako of projects past, and the background and panning shots rival that of KyoAni's quality.\u00a0 Bright colors, a beautiful shimmer over everything, and impressive effects and utilization of CGI make for a visually stunning show that makes everything look that much nicer, especially with the fact that show has magic.\\n\\n\r\nThere're a lot of glitter effects in this show.\u00a0 Shine and typical magical flair are common due to two of the main characters being mages by trade, so what we end up getting is a lot more 'movie magic' put into many scenes in order to add a unique charm to everything.\u00a0\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nBoth \"17 Sai\" by Haruka to Miyuki and \"Mimei no Kimi to Hakumei no Mahou\" by Nagi Yanagi act as somber pieces that exemplify the trapped and emotional feeling of Hitomi's journey.\u00a0 (Or at least its potential)\u00a0 You really get the feeling of growing outwardness with the OP and the somber qualities of Hitomi's lonely personality through these songs.\u00a0 Aesthetics have always felt like P.A.'s strong point, and I'm glad that these tracks came out as good as they did.\u00a0\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI love P.A. Works as a company.\u00a0 I really do.\u00a0 But loving them is a real exercise in frustration because of how much hope I put into their works only for that hope to be slandered by the end result of their newest project.\u00a0 It's gotten to a point that I kind of dread whatever comes next and coined the term 'Doing a P.A. Works' for myself whenever a show with potential ends up floundering at the end cause the execution is just poor.\u00a0 Shinohara Toshiya was also a massive red flag for me considering NagiAsu is one of the biggest examples for how P.A. Works manages to falter its writing and potential towards the tail end of a series, especially due to love triangles and tension within the group because of that.\\n\\n\r\nBut Irozuku doesn't manage the same as its predecessors, instead having a new trend of: A story with good potential, floundered middle, and a good end.\u00a0 I don't like this pattern, but it's a new one for the company nonetheless.\u00a0 It feels to me almost like P.A. played it safe this time, choosing to go for what they normally do but tone it back so much that any high impact moments feel like a light tap instead of a punch to the gut that it probably should've been so that they don't screw up so badly by doing something like 'Pull a Charlotte'.\u00a0 The end of that created a lukewarm series that feels like it accomplished sort of what it wanted to do, but did it in a way that made whatever was being show only have a subtle enough impact to insinuate that SOMETHING happened, but maybe not.\u00a0\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nReally I stand at a bit of an impasse with P.A. this time cause it's not like they ruined what they made.\u00a0 Quite the opposite really considering I was extremely afraid of the inherent problem of a time traveler who has to go back going back in time and falling in love with someone from the past.\u00a0 It ended exactly how I wanted (and expected) it to despite the romantic subplot, and for that I breathe a sigh of relief.\u00a0 Still, even with the ending being as good if not a little better than what I expected it to be, I still don't find Irozuku to be little more than something that deserved a better execution than what it got.\\n\\n\r\nAs such, I can't really recommend this show cause I can't give a proper assessment on account of the fact that it doesn't sit right with me.\u00a0 It's not great, it's not terrible, it's not average cause it has too many problems in its middle portion to just be a 'meh' product, but it's not so bad that it doesn't have its good points.\u00a0 So honestly, make your own judgment on whether or not this is worth a watch.\u00a0 As for me, I hope that we don't get another Shinohara Toshiya for a long while.\u00a0 Irozuku is a lot less heavy-handed and stressful than NagiAsu is to watch, but assessing his works and by extension anything P.A. Works does takes up a lot of time.\u00a0 I blame on the fact that I care about the company too much.",

Just beginning of the first episode, it has already displayed amazing talents to be one of the best anime of the year.\r\nAlso, because it's about TIME TRAVEL, when it's time travel there's always this suspense element, suspecting if Hitomi's going to end up with Aoi or they are forced to separate after that. Besides that, I love the opening and the ending of the anime, also totally worth listening to. In addition, every time watching it, it has the right feels that hit you that grabs your attention and makes you tobe dedicated to it. The characters are all awesome especially Yuito and Aoi. (Most probably gonna be a sad ship)\\n\\n\r\nIn a nutshell, it's an outstanding anime that has the right story, art, sound, character and enjoyment. Any anime fans should never miss it, if you do you will regret it for the rest of your life until you actually watch it! So, go watch it now!",

            "content": "A underrated hidden gem of the fall season.This show actually depicts the literal and true meaning of colors in life. Another good thing it's an original series which makes it quite more interesting..\r\nThe start of the series begins in a world sixty years from now, people where people have incorporated using various magic to ease up their life. \r\nBut our female protagonist Hitomi who comes from a family of magicians hates magic. The very irony. \r\nAlso she has another dilemma color blindness. The cause? Quite a mystery. She's doesn't feel much joy from life. Leads quite a monotonous life. \r\nHer grandmother, Kohaku, knowing what hitomiis going through, decides to send her sixty years back to meet her younger self, in hopes of helping Hitomi to overcome the situation.\\n\r\nAnd now the Story begins with hitomi living life in the past along with the grandmother and her other school friends. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 7/10\\n\r\nOur female Mc Hitomi. As I said earlier at the start she is quite the typical shy, a little slight depressed, quiet character.She doesn't like magic due to apparent reasons. But throughout the series she shows slow but good character development from liking, learning and using magic to opening up with her emotions and learning to enjoy life more.\\n\r\nQuite pleasant to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOur male Mc Aoi. Quite the normal Mc at first, but more to him than meets the eye. A excellent artist with his drawings. Sensible and smart. But still has some personal problems with his motivation and desire to draw and create art. \\n\\n\r\nInteresting thing, the only place Hitomi can see colors is Aoi's drawings, which literally come to life for her, Magic? well you can find that for yourselves. Obviously she is mysteriously attracted to it, curious and wanting to see more. Aoi on the other hand with his problems is also intrigued by this unique situation as he later gets to know about her color blindness.\\n\r\nSo now both share and develop a unique bonding  & start trying to figure out and indirectly help with each others situation, while growing closer to each other at the same time. \\n\r\nAt the few end episodes of the series a strong hint of romance is indicated between them \\n\\n\r\nThen there is the grandmother or lets say the young version of grandmother Kohaku. She is for me the MVP of the series. A Joyful, carefree girl who is not only smart and skilled at magic, but also knows how to play the wingman for our two MC's. \\n\r\nShe also can be a serious & sensible person who you can rely for advice and help in need. Great character and waifu material for sure.\\n\\n\r\nThe Other side characters are interesting too. They provide good entertainment to the main story and support to the MC's and have bit of decent development to their personalities as well. \\n\r\nThey don't have any extra ordinary qualities, but i really like it, mainly because of how good the relationships built between the characters are. \\n\r\nStory 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is a combination of Slice of life, Magic and Romance. Magic is the main concept, which is definitely shown and represented in abundance and in quality.\\n\\n\r\nThe story presented to be honest is a bit complicated but rather it is really well supported by the supernatural and fantasy element with a bit of emotions and feels thrown into the mix. \\n\r\nThe Beautiful concept and application of Magic is displayed which along with the stunning visual scenarios can be breathtaking at times for real.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIt just shows us how beautiful and deep meaning colors have in our life, which depicting every bit of deep emotions.\\n\r\nHitomi's character especially when we see the monochrome view through her perspective, we realize how dull and monotonous life is without colors, not literally but the actual color of life.\\n\r\nAlso,most of the times it maintains its the simplicity which is really enjoyable\\n\\n\r\nOne thing i was slightly disappointed was they took a bit of time for story progress and mainly character development, and very less amount of drama and romance. Which was later a bit rushed and incorporated in the final few episodes.\\n\r\nThey could have done better in that department considering its a original series. \\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nThe Best part of the series and i mean for real. like literally if i could say If any anime could come close to Violet Evergarden in terms of animation this year. It would be this series\\n\\n\r\nI mean PA Works just outdone themselves, i mean literally blew me out of my seat from the first episode and got me hooked The background art is literally one of the best you can find in anime,the multi admirable display and usage of colors and some indeed very well captured unique camera angles and beautiful sceneries, literally makes this show stand out from the rest. \\n\r\nCharacter animations are very smooth and looks natural. Absolutely top quality animations. Mad respect again to PA Works. I would watch it again Just for the Art and animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nI want to appreciate voice acting on this show and the background sound track, really well done. But more than that, i want to give a heartfelt applause to really to the OST, both Opening and Ending tracks. \\n\r\nFrom the first episode I was already like *WOW* from the soundtracks. The OST used are almost certainly beautiful, just as the show itself is, its really heartwarming and melodic. \\n\\n\r\nOn a side note i really love the ED \"Mimei no Kimi to Hakumei no Mahou\" sung by Nagi Yanagi, what a talent. The song itself is so melancholic and soothing with the amazing animation again. \\n\r\nIt just makes me wanna close my eyes and let the song take me away for real.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion \\n\r\nI would just say, please watch it. This show is really amazing and consistent with its Stunning mind blowing, Visuals,Satisfying plot, likable characters, the wonderful world of colorful Magic and a bit of a powerful message to the meaning of people and colors in life.\\n\r\nLets just say how the right people bring different colors to your life. Great Job PA works again wonderful work done right. \\n\r\nIt started unexpectedly for me but this series still made me craving for more right to the end. Good stuff.\\n",

            "content": "Before this review starts, learn something about rare myopia:\r\nMonochromacy, or Achromatopsia, is a true rarity in the world of myopic colour blindness. Or in layman terms: \"People with monochromatic vision can see no colour at all, and their world consists of different shades of grey ranging from black to white, rather like only seeing the world on an old black and white television set. Achromatopsia is extremely rare, occurring only in approximately 1 person in 33,000 and its symptoms can make life very difficult.\"\r\nThat's the circumstances that befalls on the life and upbringing of Hitomi Tsukushiro, a 17-year-old emotionless girl, and the descendant of awitch family, growing up in total colour blindness and having blimps of magic in life. Raised in the future, and then in the year 2078, her grandmother Kohaku chocks up some time-travelling sand to send Hitomi back to the present day of the year 2018 (since it's an original-sourced work by Natsuka Yashio) to fix her sorry state before everything is as it were 60 years down the line, to help her understand what it means to see the world in colours through the different sets of eyes from the people she interacts with: Be it her own same-aged grandmother, and the Magic Photography Club members (especially Yuito, with her first encounter being after dropped from the time-sending bus, escaping from his house, then unconsciously meeting him face-to-face with his drawing that at long last brought the sight of colors into her life).\\n\\n\r\nThe life that Hitomi has to be lead on is one that has to be well-trodden, and under special circumstances, if all she has ever going for her is the constant but gradual help from the other Magic Photography Club members (Asagi, Kurumi, Yuito, Chigusa, Sho, along with Kohaku) in requesting her to do activities that help each other see differing views of one another, along with some enhancement magic spellcasting from Kohaku (at the time when everyone in school sees her magic as either a nuisance or an asset). With Kohaku's request to help Hitomi regain her colour of sight (or lose that colour blindness either way, even for a brief moment), everyone has a wandering feeling about Hitomi at first glance, but as soon as she starts to slowly open up (which I feel her shyness/closed-up introversion is painful but relatable to watch), they understand where she's coming from and attempt to help her experience the typical person's life that's full of colour and happiness (with some help from Kohaku's magic spellcasting). Viewpoint from story and characters are engaging yet also alert on their surroundings, and the character development of each and everyone feels as if they're on a joyride, going through the numerous pangs of life.\\n\\n\r\n*Spoiler ALERT* And here's where I have a nitpick for hits and a BIG miss. Knowing director Toshiya Shinohara (being well known for Nagi no Asukara, another P.A. Works classic), the miss is in the romance segment. If you watch the OP animations bit by bit, you can tell that the pairings of the characters are immediately on-sight (Asagi X Sho, Chigusa X Kurumi, Yuito X Hitomi). Take for example, in Episode 9, Sho asks a regular request of Hitomi, of going together around the city to take photos (a.k.a. A foolish way to ask her on a date), and then confesses to her emotionless state before unknowingly running away from his reply, to then Asagi has to confront her about the entire situation, then explain from Hitomi's perspective, and as a means to an end, reconcile without any know-how, for the sake of prolonging (unnecessary) drama. That's just blatant \"insert casual\" writing and a waste of resources (production, airtime, not to mention $$$ to boot). No wonder there's a lot of flak on this particular episode where nothing makes sense from the departure against the good flow of the series (to that end). If there was a choice, this episode seriously needs to be cut out.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the hits are subtle and ever-growing interaction of the cast, but the blandness (of Hitomi's character drive) and boredom (Club members always doing the same-but-different things over and over again) can set in when at least expected, and draw the audience away from the big picture, which is seeing Hitomi recognize her space and vision of colour in her own world. Not to mention, that since Yuito is the solutional catalyst for Hitomi's predicament, the last arc (where Hitomi has to contemplate living in the now vs. going back to her time) has both of them recognizing their feelings for one another, and the build-up from being one of the club members right down to the final moments where Hitomi gradually disappearing/fading from the current time, has him really down to the core of whether to accept Hitomi for who she is, and Episode 11's bittersweet end (where their endless run to close hugging embrace) just encapsulates how much they really need one another to breathe life (or colour rather) into each other. Such a cool and good moment for never-ending cheek-rolling tears of joy. In the end, Hitomi manages to see colours, this time with both eyes too, so objective cleared for the character cast (and mostly Yuito for being with her in the final stages)! What a pleasant sight to behold.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're like the studio NUT of concern (like how I am always), there's nothing to fear with P.A. Works standards as per the main course of relinquishment. And this time, the production staff just 1-upped themselves as the whole production is absolutely the real deal. For a series that embodies colours as its main source of documentation, both art and animations are a step above anything else that can be equaled (or close) to anything KyoAni could ever have done. Instaneous great care has been taken responsible by the animators, photographers and even the artists, and the evidence is translated into the obscenely colourful visuals with great contrasting variety and combinations that is just eye-dropping, and pairing up is the smooth-buttery animation that the studio is known for with great angled POVs that really stand out amongst the competition. Overall, I'd say for the year, this stands in line with KyoAni's Violet Evergarden for the most grand productions ever made.\\n\\n\r\nSound-wise, this is technically another competent area as well. The OST really shines (with the aid of background visuals of course) with the finest ways it could to a certain degree. Haruka to Miyuki's \"17 Sai\" embodies the feelings of 17-year-old young adults (in this case, the character cast) trying to imagine how to live life with expressions translated into colours. And I've gotta admit, it's a cool song that speaks about living life to the fullest, and bringing forth the technicolour feel (that initially I hated it but after hearing the song over and over, I began to love it for what it is). And if you know Nagi Yanagi's repertiore of calm-collected-composure songs, the ED is really no different, and is once again, light-hearted and speaks volumes about Hitomi's future of monotony and colour with contrasting effects. A somewhat heavy-sentimental song that still manages to tug at the hearts of many (including myself).\\n\\n\r\nAs it is with the hype of P.A. Works production, I'm equally content that I managed to watch this interesting premise of a show, learn some pointers (not the romance part though) and be stunned by how everything works together to create an excellent aesthetic of visuals and great emotional character-driven development, that just begs the question of how does all of it come together to create a moment that seemingly won't last forever, but will forever be remembered for times to come. The only reason I can see people dropping this is just the slow-but-progressive storytelling, and the bland MC Hitomi (but trust me, there's 1001 reasons why for her unsentimental self). But I plead you, overlook these potential problems, and you'll have a show that's well deserving of its initial under-appreciation. Guess this could be a recommendation if you are an aspiring artist, or someone who loves to see artistic beauty at its finest.\\n\\n\r\nThere won't be simply a show like this and Iroduku is a masterpiece in its own right (although great to begin with).",

            "content": "I just have 3 words to say: SASUGA P.A. WORKS! Irozuku had all the Nagi no Asukara vibes yet it had it's own originality to set it apart from Nagi no Asukara. I absolutely loved watching Irozuku no Ashita Kara. From the story, to the characters, animation and music, they were all 10/10!!!\r\nStory: It all started when Grandma Kohaku decided to send Hitomi back 60 years to the past. That's when all the feels and romance started. It was as if fate had intervened. Hitomi ended up in Yuito's room and met Yuito when he was drawing. That was when she realized she could seethe colors in his drawing. At first Yuito was surprised, but as the two of them bonded together in the same club, romance started to fill the air as both fell in love with each other. They both went out with each other, chased each other down the street, and hugged each other in a final act of love. Alas, Hitomi had to return to her timeline, but that was not the end of their relationship just yet. Something interfered with Kohaku's magic and sent both Yuito and Hitomi to another world, a dull world. However, as Hitomi and Yuito both confessed to and hugged each other, the curse of Hitomi started to break apart, and Hitomi realized that she could finally see color again. After saying their final goodbyes, Hitomi was finally sent back to the future. God I feel like I'm writing a romance novel. In other story, this story is about Hitomi's growth as a person as she interacts with other characters. At first, she was cold, shy and rather aloof. However, she soon becomes a warm and friendly person, willing to talk to others and help them. I love how the characters interacted with one another and the various ships associated with them. Sho X Asagi, Kurumi X Chigusa and the stars of the show, Hitomi X Yuito. The story is also heartwarming full of feels! I cried while watching certain episodes. Overall a 10/10 story. The only criticism I can give is they rushed the middle of the anime a bit so there's a bit of inconsistency when it comes to the pacing of the show.\\n\r\nRating: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: You know that animation will be on point when P.A. Works is the one animating the anime. The animation was like Nagi no Asukara, PERFECTION! I loved the animation of the scenery, the characters, the magic effects, and of course, the fireworks!!! I also love how they put so much detail into the animation. The only criticism I can give is they botched up some of the animation for the last episode. Other than that, 10/10! \\n\r\nRating: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nMusic/Sound\\n\r\nAgain, it's P.A. Works, so the music is amazing!!! I love both the opening and especially the ending they're so beautiful and soothing to listen to. Mimei no imi to Hakumei no Mahou has become my top 5 songs for this year! The sound effects for magic casting are also great to hear! \\n\r\nRating: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Ah yes the characters. P.A. Works did a pretty good job for the characters. There was just enough character development for each character to make us fall in love with them. I loved how they developed Hitomi's character. I already mentioned it earlier so I'll skip her. Yuito is quite gentle but quite dense. Sho is the big brother character trying to protect and looking out for everyone. Asagi is the little sister character a soft and emotional character. Chigusa is the.... clown of the anime with all the jokes he makes and sometimes the insensitive things he says. Kurumi is probably the most level headed and smartest person out of the bunch? And of course, Kohaku the most cheerful and fun-loving character although she can get serious. I have a hard time choosing which is my favorite character but you know what, I'm gonna do something different and choose Hitomi as my favorite character for the show. \\n\r\nRating: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, my favorite anime for Fall 2018 season and possibly my top 5 anime for this year! I absolutely love Irozuku and I gotta thank P.A. Works for making such a heartwarming anime.\\n\\n\r\nFinal rating: 10/10",

            "content": "I'm glad I paid attention to this one this season, or else I'd have missed out big time.\r\nPros:\r\n- Artwork is absolutely breathtaking from beginning to end.  From the vividly colored magical moments, to the dialed back calmer moments, everything about the artwork complements the story in almost every moment and as a result serves as the main spectacle the series has to offer.  Definitely is a few steps above your typical anime, giving it the quality of many cinematic anime film.\r\n- Characters are very well written.  Even though most people watching don't suffer from the same problem as Hitomi, it is stillhandled very well and the audience can sympathize and understand her character more and more as the series progresses.  Many of the side characters are also just as well written through character arcs sprinkled throughout the series that turn these (at first) one dimensional anime characters into characters you start to understand and feel a connection with\\n\\n\r\n- There are some really interesting and creative plot concepts and visual concepts thrown throughout that add a very unique fantasy twist that make this rise above your standard slice-of-life affair.  Quite often, I found myself comparing these to the likes of many classic Studio Ghibli films.\\n\\n\r\n- Thankfully, P.A. Works did not leave us with a horrible ending (as they are infamous for). \\n\\n\r\n- Sound felt very realistic, and the musical accompaniment serviced the series perfectly.\\n\\n\r\n- While I mostly don't mind series that incorporate violence, harsh language, and fan service into their shows, it's nice to see a series, for once, that avoids all of them and still ends up remaining engaging and well executed on multiple fronts.\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\\n\r\n- While I thought the ending was good, there is one minor nitpick I have with it.  (SPOILER ALERT) There was one scene at the very end showing Hitomi at someone's grave.  It's assumed to be Yuito's, but its so vague that it might not be also.  A quick explanation (like showing the name on the grave) would have been nice. (SPOILER END).\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nWhile I'm sure there are plenty out there, this is the first anime series I've seen that captures a truly cinematic feeling not commonly seen in many anime or TV series in general.  Whether you enjoyed it or not, there's no denying that lots of effort and love went into this project.  For the most part, I think it pays off nicely.  If you love the lush, colorful, artistry of Shinkai Makoto's work integrated with a solid romance/drama anime, and just a tiny bit of Ghibli magic calling back to \"Kiki's Delivery Service\" and \"Spirited Away\", then \"Irozuku: The World Of Colors\" is a no-brainer.  In my opinion, best series of Fall 2018.",

I\u2019m so glad I stumbled upon it and decided to watch it as it left me with a huge impact despite its simpleness\r\nThis anime might not be everyone\u2019s cup of tea. A lot of ppl may have found Hitomi (MC) annoying or boring and what not, but for me, I could genuinely relate to her.\r\nWhile watching her I could see a glimpse of myself back in school days...Does the feeling of loneliness, closing off yourself completely from others, not being able to talk even if you want to and people simply brushing youoff as a shy or weird person rings bell, eh?\\n\r\nIf it does then do give it a watch. You won\u2019t regret it.\\n\\n\r\nHaving people who can truly understand you and accept you for who you are is truly a blessing because it helps not just you but also them to see their weaknesses and grow from it. And this is what the central message of this anime is. \\n\\n\r\nAll the characters are extremely charming.  You just cannot not like any one of them. \\n\r\nAnd they have their own share of problems which is pretty relatable to each one of us \\n\r\nThe elderly people were so nice. It made me feel how nice it must be having grandparents like that because I don\u2019t really have any memories with mine.\\n\r\nMoreover the MC being color blind was really unique as you don\u2019t get to see this kind of a storyline that often. \\n\r\nAlso the story is not at all predictable. One of the main reasons is Ofcourse the time skip, because you never know how the story is going to end whenever time skip is involved.\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of those animes which I can rewatch without getting bored! I really liked it a lot..\\n\\n\r\nJust an additional message from my side, \\n\r\nYou are great as you are...If you don\u2019t get along well with people around you that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re weird or that there\u2019s anything wrong with you. It\u2019s just that you haven\u2019t met the right people meant for you yet...And you will definitely meet them one day! :)",

            "content": "Iroduku is the epitome of all drama and slice of life anime. From the gorgeous art, pleasing soundtracks, and lovable characters, almost everything is perfect. It's a very touching anime with the intention of leaving a good impression with its viewers, teaching them a life lesson that'll change the way they perceive this world. \r\nAnd they successfully pulled it off. \r\n~[Story]~ \r\nThis is the weakest part of this anime. It's still good. I love how the annoying love triangles didn't last long (they handled it really well), fights got resolved quickly (thank God they communicate!), and the long awaited confession scene was greatly executed. Inmy opinion, it's one of the best confession scenes out there. Who would've thought a piece of paper with a little bit of magic will result to one of the sweetest and most romantic scenes of all time? \\n\\n\r\nHowever, just like what I said, it's still the weakest. In some episodes, it just felt flat. It became a bit boring to the point I once thought \"Oh, just get it over with\". I honestly watched an episode in 2x speed because of that. \\n\\n\r\nI understand that they're laying the groundwork and the likes but it gets tiring. This happened around the middle part of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nBut thankfully, during the last parts, oh darn. Things finally picked up. Every episode is a rollercoaster of emotions. So many revelations, pivotal moments, and amazing character developments. Thank God I didn't drop this anime or else I wouldn't discover this precious gem and the priceless value it has. \\n\\n\r\nThey definitely made up for those boring episodes, rewarding its viewers with a thrilling rollercoaster ride filled with emotions and character developments which made everything so worth it and beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nI just wish the ending was a bit better because they left one loose thread but it still tied everything up nicely.\\n\\n\r\nScore: 9/10 \\n\\n\r\n~[Art]~\\n\\n\r\nThe art is very astounding. There are a lot of beautiful backgrounds. I took many screenshots while watching this series. I love how they portrayed the colors, and the black and white scenes. They really added a lot of depth to the whole anime. \\n\\n\r\nPrepare to be amazed especially when the characters use magic. So beautiful. \\n\\n\r\nHowever the character designs, especially the main guy, isn't my favorite. I don't understand how such a beautiful anime could have such a boring character designs. They're very lacklustre and barely complimented the gorgeous backgrounds. But, even with that, I still believe the art of this anime deserves praise. \\n\\n\r\nScore: 10/10\\n\\n\r\n~[Sound]~ \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is the strongest part of this anime. It's very pleasant and has a calming effect. The OSTs are memorable, the ending's great, but the opening beats them all. 17 Sai is one of the best anime openings I've ever heard. When I first listened to the first few seconds of the song, I immediately knew this'd be my fave anime opening of Fall 2018. \\n\\n\r\nThey definitely added more impact to the scene and the creators inserted them at the right moment and shot. This resulted to a very memorable scenes that'll be remembered by its viewers for a long time. \\n\\n\r\nScore: 10/10\\n\\n\r\n~[Character]~\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are relatable and lovable. You'll immediately get immersed into their world and get attached with the people living in it. The main cast is the sort of people I want to meet and be friends with forever. They were a good influence to Hitomi and changed her for the better. \\n\\n\r\nAt the same time, you can tell how much everyone in this show cares for her. Whenever I see scenes depicting this, my heart always swell up with joy, and muttering \"Ahh, thank God. Hitomi's not alone anymore\". \\n\\n\r\nEveryone also had great character development especially the main guy. I'm really proud of him and I'm glad I didn't think ill of him no matter how \"boring\" he may seem. I knew he'll have a great development. Same goes with Hitomi as well. I'm just really happy for her. \\n\\n\r\nOh and Asagi is #bestgirl definitely. I won't give out too much details but let me just say, they really did her character right. \\n\\n\r\nIt breaks my heart to leave them behind but I'll always remember the great things they did for Hitomi and how they made her feel belonged and loved. \\n\\n\r\nScore: 10/10\\n\\n\r\n~[Enjoyment]~\\n\\n\r\nIn this case, enjoyment = times I cried. And that's a lot especially on the last few episodes. Thank God I decided to wait for three weeks and binged them all in one day. \\n\\n\r\nPlus, it didn't help either that I'm a huge crybaby. I was teary eyed for almost thirty minutes on one episode and literally cried for almost an hour while watching the last two episodes because my heart couldn't just take it anymore. \\n\\n\r\nI won't delve too much into the details. Let me just say that make sure there are tissues beside you and prepare for a ride of fluctuating emotions. You can really tell that this show's playing with your heart on purpose. \\n\\n\r\nScore: 10/10\\n\\n\r\n~[Conclusion]~\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Iroduku is a really beautiful and touching anime. This is the type that appeals more to the heart rather than the mind and after watching, it'd leave behind a good impression and a great life lesson. The story's good, the art's gorgeous, the sounds are pleasant, and the characters are memorable. \\n\\n\r\nThey handled a lot of tropes well and did everything related to it right. It's refreshing to see a new take on these clich\u00e9d scenes which made me love this anime even more. The romance was handled really great especially the confession scene. I'll always remember that scene fondly even though it broke my heart at the same time. \\n\\n\r\nSo if you're planning to watch this, prepare tissues and even though it's already obvious how it'd end from episode 1, it's still a great ride that you shouldn't miss out. Once it gets boring, just hang in there. It's only for a few episodes. I promise after that, things would pick up without giving you time to breathe. And most of all, prepare for a touching and bittersweet anime that'll change the way you perceive this world. \\n\\n\r\nAhhh, I'll truly miss this anime. Thank you for the wonderful memories, Iroduku and P.A. Works. \\n\\n\r\nP.S.: This is the first ever anime from P.A. Works I've ever watched. I'm so excited for their future works!\\n",

            "content": "To this day, Kimi ni Todoke remains one of my favorite rom-coms of all time, close to my heart in a way that few other series manage to touch. If I were to designate one reason above all else why it was able to sweep me away so completely, it\u2019s that it takes place in a world that is fundamentally good. Everyone in Kimi ni Todoke is the best person they can possibly be, always ready to reach out a helping hand to guide each other through their troubles. The show\u2019s world feels like a world that actively wants its characters to succeed, and theresult is probably the single most comforting atmosphere in all of anime, a universe that I love diving into and snuggling under like a warm fluffy blanket on a winter\u2019s day. It would be so easy for a show with this much heart on its sleeve to come off as overly saccharine, but thanks to the strength of its stellar cast, its production values, and Sawako herself being one of the smartest written anime protagonists of all time, it never tips into treacle. It\u2019s a beautiful balancing act of warmth and compassion that I\u2019ve never seen pulled off quite as well as it is there.\\n\\n\r\nI bring all this up to say that Iroduku: The World in Colors captures that same essence better than any show since Kimi ni Todoke itself, and the result is probably my favorite show of the Fall 2018 season.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes Iroduku such a fantastic successor to Kimi ni Todoke\u2019s throne of nice people doing nice things is just how well its premise and execution embrace the easy, un-posturing warmth that human interaction can be at its best. The story follows Hitomi, a girl from the future born to a family of witches with an obvious depression metaphor that keeps her from seeing colors. You might think that this concept would be enough to fill an entire world of storytelling possibilities all on its own, but nope; that\u2019s just the set-up for the real story. The actual plot kicks in when Hitomi\u2019s grandmother uses time magic to send her into her own childhood for reasons that aren\u2019t immediately explained in-universe, but on a meta sense are very clearly an attempt to help her granddaughter work through her emotional issues. Thus, Hitomi finds herself transported sixty years into the past- a.k.a. our present- and doing her best to fit into normal life there, going to school, joining a club, connecting with her grandmother\u2019s now-teenage self, and meeting a similarly disaffected boy whose drawings are the one thing she\u2019s able to see in color, all while trying to figure out why her grandmother sent her back in the first place and what she\u2019s supposed to do.\\n\\n\r\nSo yes, the fertile set-up of magic and time travel ends up being the skeleton for a very loose slice-of-life/romance tale, less interested in the mechanics of this unique take on the world and more in the emotional journeys of everyone in the photography and artistry club Hitomi ends up joining. But therein lies the subtle genius at the core of Iroduku\u2019s story; while the mystical and magical elements aren\u2019t the focus, they are still woven into the fabric of the narrative. In this world, magic is commonplace and common knowledge, but not in the sense like Harry Potter where it\u2019s wizards and broomsticks around every corner; here, magic is integrated into life as we know it, not so much altering how the world operates as providing spice and flavor to a very familiar setting. This is a story about a normal group of teenagers living normal teenage lives that just happens to have magic dancing around the edges. It\u2019s a story of a group of photography students who care for each other and want to see each other succeed, of the bonds they share and the bonds they form, of the passion they have for their art and how they use it to prop each other up, and all the while Hitomi and her grandmother are able to provide visual splendor to the emotions everyone\u2019s feeling with a single wave of they improvised Pocky wands.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that\u2019s what I love about this show; it\u2019s magical realism where the magic truly feels real, and reality truly feels magical. If magic actually existed in an otherwise normal interpretation of our universe, this is exactly how I imagine it would be implemented; as something familiar yet exciting, in powders and potions that everyone can use but not everyone can make, creating splashy effects to enhance school projects and demonstrations, a collector\u2019s item for adventurous souls who love to experiment, a recipe one can brew up with patience and time, baked into every subtle facet of these ordinary, extraordinary lives its characters lead. I love watching them use water magic to walk on water for a club presentation like one might use a fog machine. I love watching Hitomi learn to cook up enchanted sand as if it were a real recipe with components that can run dry and a clear process to its creation. I love how alive this world feels, how utterly gorgeous its reflection of reality is. Admittedly, I am the biggest slut in existence for exactly this kind of heartfelt confectionary, ESPECIALLY the pastel rainbow color palette that makes every ray of light feel like it\u2019s been reflected through a million stained glass windows before reaching the earth. But thanks to just how goddamn staggering the production values are (seriously, even in a year with Violet Evergarden this show is remarkable in its beauty) and how warm the character interactions are, it manages to feel truly whimsical, capturing a flee-flying spirit of imagination and wonder that makes the world feel as alive to us as it does to Hitomi as she gradually opens her shell up.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I compare this show heavily to Kimi ni Todoke, it isn\u2019t following that show\u2019s exact framework. Kimi ni Todoke was very focused on character writing, on making each individual player in its world feel as alive and vibrant as humanly possible. It was a show where I could look at each character and recognize them as a fully fleshed-out creation with their own thoughts, feelings, and desires. That\u2019s not the case with Iroduku; no one in this show, except perhaps Hitomi\u2019s wonderfully rambunctious teenage grandmother, is complex or memorable enough to carry the story on their own. The strength of this cast comes from their interactions and how their warmth all feeds into each other, which explains why the first and last episodes, in which Hitomi has alternatively not yet formed those connections and is leaving them behind, are easily and unfortunately the weakest episodes of the show. The character writing just isn\u2019t strong enough to support them on their own. Thankfully, it makes up the slack with its situation writing: when Iroduku\u2019s characters talk, they feel like real people having real conversations about real issues, like I could step through the screen and join right in with them. What helps capture this feeling of naturalism is that the dialogue writing is very good at saying just as much as it needs to and nothing more. The characters will occasionally speak in emotional exposition, laying out the groundwork of their emotional states, but it never goes so far as to spell out the conclusions you\u2019re supposed to reach. It just lets these characters reveal as much as they need to, and leaves the unspoken end result of those conversations to hover in the air, providing texture to every single time these character interact from then on.\\n\\n\r\nAnd nowhere is this clearer than in a handful of utterly breathtaking scenes that are too spoilery to properly explore in full. To speak without giving away the game, there are moments where Hitomi\u2019s magic takes her into the color-filled drawings of the aforementioned artist boy, and if you know anything about art in fiction, it shouldn\u2019t be a surprise that these moments end up delving deep into these characters\u2019 psyches with metaphor and symbolism bubbling from the depths of this crayola-sketched world. But what truly makes them such a experience is that these metaphors are allowed to play themselves out in silence. The precise details of what\u2019s going on in these surreal sequences don\u2019t matter; what matters is the feeling they evoke. Which means you\u2019re allowed to watch these abstract, almost avant-garde expressions of feeling just wash over you, getting you into the characters\u2019 emotional headspaces better than any expositional dialogue would do. And it\u2019s really goddamn powerful. I had to remind myself to breathe at several points, I was so entranced by the unspoken story playing out in front of me. It\u2019s only once the magic is over and the characters have returned to their world that we get some context into what emotions and experiences formed the basis of all those metaphors, and once again, we\u2019re only given just enough to \u201cget it\u201d without spoiling the mystique of the event itself. If for nothing else, you should watch Iroduku just for those few sequences; they\u2019re really a sight to behold.\\n\\n\r\nBut in reality, you should watch Iroduku for so much more. You should watch it for its utterly gorgeous depiction of a world just a colorful hop removed from our own. You should watch it for the warmth of its cast and their immensely fun interactions. You should watch it for the timelessness of its reality, and the engrossing whimsy of it magic. And you should watch it for its poignant, affecting story of depression, hope, and learning to see color in a world of black and while. Iroduku: The World in Colors is a gorgeous feast for all senses, including the most important one: the heart.",

            "content": "Perfect marks all the way across the board.  Not to often do you run into a piece of media that you cant find some sort of grievance with. Irozuku was truly worth waiting every week for.  The summary for the show lets you know there will be just a hint of magic involved,  but  this blend of slice of life  and out of the norm concepts isn't forced or unbalanced at all.  I do believe almost everyone will be able to settle in for this 12 episode adventure andwalk away having been entertained.  \\n\\n\r\n             The story is really easy to follow as its very generous with in the moment intention, and not heavy in misdirection.   Shows often rely on cliffhangers to keep the viewer interested.  While I cant say there are none in Irozuku,  I can say this story often gives some form of satisfying revelation to build excitement at the end of each episode,  making it okay to take a break and reflect on the story. That format definitely helped me appreciate it as I spent more time thinking about what had just happened,  and not guessing at what I should be expecting.   The foundation of Irozuku is a coming out of my shell type fable focused on the main character, Hitomi.  The environment around Hitomi is full of her new found friends and family that all develop and contribute in their own way. Even with the stage being shared by so many individuals, I never once felt like I was taking a break from one character to focus on another. The coexistence between the main and supporting characters was flawlessly laid out.  Nothing felt gratuitous and everyone and everything had a purpose.  Some laughs, some tears,  but over all very well done.\\n\\n\r\n                        VISUALLY PLEASING,     If the quality of this animation becomes the new standard of Anime, then we have a bright future as viewers of this already wonderful media format.  Not only is this show a treat for the eyes, but the art and quality of Irozuku play a huge role in telling this story.  Had the quality of animation or even just scenery choices been any different,  the story itself would have had a difficult time being as mesmerizing as it is.  The  music selections and environmental noises in this show even seem to follow the animation in an odd but magical sort of way.  As apposed to the norm of music being used to set the mood, it feels like the mood sets the music.  That the jingles and sounds themselves couldn't play with out the story starting them up.  Confusing,  but I mean to say,  the music was less of an added enhancement and felt more like it just belonged.  \\n\\n\r\n                        As a fan of many genres of anime,  you find yourself recognizing many tropes.  I absolutely love the fact that the characters of Irozuku seem almost trope-less, and more like individuals.  Their involvement and reactions to the ongoing world around them are so genuine you will find it hard to pick favorites.   This is even so more amazing given the special circumstances governing select characters in this story.  Especially the ones tied into the magic aspect of this slice of life type drama.\\n\\n\r\n                 Start to finish Irozuku is a completed story, and this might have some viewers wanting for a different ending or thinking \"what if\".   Not saying you wont be completely satisfied, but the whole story will have you trying to work out a way for this amazing fable to continue on.   All in all your bearded pal Grizzziff gives Irozuku a 10/10. I highly recommend this experience.",

            "content": "This anime falls within the slow paced drama genres with some magic to spice things up, if you have watched 5cm per second, just because or your name then you have already essentially experienced all there is to this anime but the other shows did it better. So why bother watching? For the characters naturally and sadly this show fails horribly at it but to make this consistent I will express my views on the characters, story and then finally the art.\r\nCharacters(Hitomi *Spoilers*)\r\nThe characters in this show are so weak it is sad, our main character Hitomi to be blunt is stale, listless and easilyforgettable. She has lost her sense of color since she was a child for an unknown reason, doesn't like magic cause reasons and therefore is anti-social and shy cause reasons. She most have had the worst childhood ever for her to be so negative just because she can't see colours, she doesn't talk to anyone at all clearly because in ep 2 she goes on about how no one has every said they want to see her magic or \\n\r\nhow it can make someone happy. This show also loves forcing drama down your throat making any tension painful unnatural or outright stupid. Example: ep2 she finally says she wants to see Shou's art, hooray finally wasn't so hard was it? Why was there even tension for such a simple question? When she sees it nothing happens end of issue. Yup that is it, queue credits lol. I find her genuinely frustrating, she is a character that is portrayed as some victim (Thanks to Shou and grandma) who is innocent but she is very much incompetent and self pitying. However, because I need to say what I like about this show, in terms of Hitomi I like how she is pretty, thanks P.A Works.\\n\\n\r\nShou is a typical edgy guy who is considered a loner but has a few close friends. Yet he must still be a edgy loner and uptight about everything apparently so he is I'll say mean to the obviously introverted Hitomi. Don't worry though they say opposites attract, he'll probably have some back story as to why he has got to be negative all the time.\\n\\n\r\nSupporting characters are all cliche. Wow that was quick guess the root of this show's issues are the two main characters surprise surprise.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nWe all know the story, if not read the summary. It is nothing special with only Hitomi's progression driving it which is a shame because I don't call asking a question then getting happy over someone saying something nice to you about the thing you hate progression. Well we are on ep 2 so fingers crossed this show can actually turn out to be good.\\n\\n\r\nEdit: Hello, here from the future at ep 4, nothing has changed. It is so pathetic that I didn't even need to change my review I wrote from ep 2!\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nAbsolutely fantastic. The visuals are great and the show is pure eye candy. The only issue is that Hitomi seems to be permanently blushing for some reason... In-fact make that all the females hmmm.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict: This show is average if you can look past the terrible characters. If you are like me and can't stand them it is simply bad, cringey and even frustrating to watch which is a huge shame because I'm a huge romance fan.",

The story was good but it had a lot of room for improvement, it had a lot of potential and could have been better in my opinion. to sum it up Its about a girl (Hitomi) who is sent back 60 years into the past by her grandmother (Kohaku),and during her time there she finally makes friends, falls in love and regains her ability to see colors as more lovable characters are introduced. I dont wanna spoil more than this because it would be better to watch and enjoy it for yourself.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound:10\\n\\n\r\nThe art was extremely beautiful and detailed. When i began watching the series i didn't expect much but as soon as i got into it i was blown away, thats how good the art was. The characters were designed with an  amazing amount of detail. The colors were bright stunning and perfectly suited to the anime about magic. The sound played a crucial part as well, every soundtrack perfectly matched the story and characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:9\\n\\n\r\nIts a simple story which does get complicated sometimes, i cant say it was perfect but i can say it was great and the reason i couldn't give it a 10 was because  I was left with some unanswered questions. But that doesn't mean it wasn't good, other than a few minor problems this show was an amazing show in almost every aspect and i would totally recommend watching it as the art, colors and music were beautiful in my opinion. It was an emotional ride and every episode was extremely detailed and specially the last episode, it was really sad to see Hitomi go back.",

            "content": "TL;DR: Beautiful anime that keeps me engaged because the characters that shouldn't be aren't immune to obvious conclusions.\r\nStory 6/10\r\nIf we let it slide that time travel magic is a real overkill to treat depression the story is pretty straight forward slice of life school plot: shy, socially isolated MC is put into a new social environment, falls for a guy while at all her new friend have yet to be resolved crushes on each other or at least a personal obstacle they'll surely learn to overcome through by being friends with MC. \r\nThe strongpoint of this anime isn't the plot but the execution of it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nThis is completely fulfilling and often surpassing any reasonable expecations. \\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\r\nEverything you can ask for, but also not more. I really enjoyed the opening theme. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9/10\\n\r\nReal strongpoint of the anime in my opinion. Sure, on the top layer they are bunch of high schooler tropes but all characters have the necessary emotional depth to be believable and engaging within that frame. When it's consistent with their personality not to withhold an opinion or feeling, they won't. They aren't written needlessly emotionally disabled. MC insecure and annoyingly shy but not unbearably unable to voice needs she identified she has or ask for/accept help from people she trusts. The supporting cast is overall consistently able to read each others body language and behaviour past the verbal cues within each characters individual ability to empathise with certain emotions. They aren't out-of-character miscommuniating for the sake of miscommunicating. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10\\n\r\nI simply found the balance of time and energy allocated to the individual challenges created by the plot pleasant. They aren't dragging it out longer than believable, they aren't rushing through it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\r\nThis is a high school romance slice of life. Within that frame it's very pleasing with the magic as a key secondary, if not tertiary, element that enables the plot and beautiful visuals. It's absolutely worth watching and far above average if thats your poison.",

Only docking a point because while the sequences that require more animation are wonderfully executed, there is otherwise not that much animation in the first place.\r\nSound 8/10 \r\nAdequate (in a good way). Not distracting in any manner, but not remarkable enough to be memorable and thus warrant a great or outstanding score. OST is good but again, unremarkable outside of the OP/ED.\r\nStory 6/10\r\nThe premise itself sounds promising andlike a concept that could develop in a heartfelt manner. Plot is little to none, which is not inherently a good or a bad thing as long as the rest of the work can carry it. One of the best ways to execute a story with little plot is by turning it into either a comedy or a character study, but... \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 3/10\\n\r\nThis is not a comedy, so that is out. Six episodes in, the background characters have more distinctive traits than the the characters at the forefront, but they barely have any conflict that would let them grow. What little conflict they do have - mostly having to do with their relationships with one another - is mostly not deep enough, to the extent that solving it offscreen would be plausible (except for Asagi, but even the second half of her conflict, Sho, hardly has a role to play in what she needs to do).\\n\r\nWe know that not seeing colors is a problem for the Hitomi; however, the consequences of it are told instead of shown, so the problem doesn't feel tangible enough to get a viewer invested in its resolution. The same problem is present for all the characters - they've had too little development and conflict to keep engagement.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the conflict doesn't feel deep enough to carry itself, the characters aren't engaging enough to carry the story as a character study, and there are neither enough emotional beats, enough drama, or enough comedy to be entertaining enough to keep up with.",

That's a big plus. What I think is a problem, at least for me is the pacing. With a protagonist that is so uninteresting and uncharismatic it is hard to remain focused. The episodes drag and drag and drag on . I can't stand it. I think the show is lacking compelling story beats. There are some , for example the end of the first episode. But at times , a whole episode has nota single memorable scene. There is no conflict, there is no emotions all that characters are nice, there is no crisis \\n\r\n. Don't get me wrong, not every show can be a high stakes shounen fantasy show. In fact i don't like shounen that much. I know the show is about the personal growth of miss protagonist. The realisation that the world is fun and colorful and she should appreciate life more and she comes to terms with her flaws and that cheesy stuff and that's fine, but it is boring, 90% of the running time nothing is happening.\\n\r\nI think the biggest give away , that this show isn't that great, is the fact that there are now memes about it. \\n\r\nPlease if you read this and completely disagree with me, tell me if something interesting happens and in which episode said moment happened....",

The story is easy to follow with lovable characters and a nice soundtrack.\r\nStory 8/10: Irozuku is a time travelling story, it is easy to follow and easy to understand. Even though there is time travelling aspects, the sequence of events are linear from the viewpoint of the main character. The pacing for Irozuku can be a bit slow at times, with it speeding up at the climax stage. There is a lot of hidden messages hidden within the Anime that foreshadow events, but alsohelp you to understand the characters\u2019 personality. Along with the hidden messages, there are lot of metaphors. Please note that at the beginning will seem confusing, but everything will be explained later within the Anime. The ending of the Anime was pretty satisfying with them giving you enough information to be able to complete the story by yourself, without boxing them in. This makes it possible for a season 2 or other works that take place after the ending. \\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10: The art of Irozuku is amazing. Backgrounds look real and beautiful, for me the best looking backgrounds of 2018. The characters may look simplistic but is just a style choice for P.A Works. The colors of the Anime pop and look awesome. The Anime also has a ton of visual metaphors. With well placed flora to convey the personalities of characters or give extra information about events that are happening. CG was used a lot, but it is used only for characters in the background and it does not stick out enough to take away from the feel of the Anime. The CG characters also fit the style of the main characters which help them not stand out and overall blends in with the rest of the Anime. Great cinematography was also used to keep the visuals moving while the scene is stagnant. Characters are also easy to differentiate from each other quickly by quirks in their visual design.\\n\r\nThe Opening sequence is visually appealing and is timed well with the song.\\n\r\nThe Ending sequence is also visually appealing, but it is just scrolling through artwork from the scenery of the city in which this takes place.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10: The Opening sequence of the anime is an overall calming song that sounds nice and is personally one of my favorites of 2018.\\n\r\nThe same can be said of the Ending sequence.\\n\r\nThe OST is something that really stood out in this Anime. Was effective to set the scene and did not intrude. The scenery sounds also helped make the world feel alive and vibrant. The sounds of certain electronic devices was also realistic. Some can be a bit repetitive, but was only noticeable on the second watch through.\\n\r\nThe voice acting was great as well. The voice actors understood their characters well. The emotions of the characters could be heard in their voices and fitted with their personalities.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 8/10: The characters of Irozuku was pretty nice with a huge range of personalities. All the characters felt real to me and each of them can be liked for quirks in their personalities and also how they look. The MC can be pretty annoying in the beginning, but this Anime\u2019s main focus is the growth of said character. The characters do feel awkward at some points as these are teenagers that have not yet fully matured.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10: \\n\r\nWhy I liked it: The Anime was absolutely beautiful. The huge amount of small messages hidden in the art or even in small things that happened.\\n\r\nHard to spot metaphors is something that I like a lot in Anime, which is pretty rare in Anime.\\n\r\nThe club that the Main Character joins was the same club I was in in school. Which brought back some nostalgic feelings.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was awesome and the ED and OP was my favorite of this year.\\n\r\nThe story also uses cinematography techniques to make the story feel as it makes a direct comparison of the Main character at episode 1 and then at the end of the Anime. \\n\r\nSomething that also stood out was the nice message this Anime conveys. \\n\r\nI have re-watched this Anime (over a period of 10 hours) to give a accurate review. \\n\\n\r\nWhy you might not like it:\\n\r\nThe pacing can be seen as slow and can be boring for some people.\\n\r\nThe Romance was pretty awkward as it is mostly teens finding their first love.\\n\r\nIt can be a bit confusing at times, but everything is explained by the end of the Anime.\\n\r\nSome of the metaphors are very vague and hard to spot. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10: Overall this Anime was pretty awesome. P.A works did a good job in making this Anime feel alive and vibrant. From the sound to the art, this show blew me away. The story is the only place I found it lacking a bit. Since it is mostly an Anime that focuses on the growth of a character and not so much on a linear story. That being said the story was still nice and had a nice message to it. I label this Anime a success and give it a recommendation to watch.",

            "content": "The one word that comes to mind when describing The World In Color is simply \"beautiful\". It has this very gentle and warm vibe that keeps the anime compelling and makes you overlook more flaws than you normally would.\r\nIndeed the main force of this show is its simplicity. No matter where the story goes or what the characters do, it never tries too hard to provoke a reaction from the viewer. That makes its flaws much more forgivable cause they're not being forced down your throat. The World In Color's universe contains so many concepts that are usually milked to the last drop by otherproductions but keeps a reasonable tone about all of them. There is magic but you'll never see a magic fight, time travel but you'll never hear about time paradox or changing the future and even though the story is originally set in 2077, you'll never see any fancy sci-fi thing.\\n\\n\r\nIf there is nothing \"epic\" in it then you might wonder what kind of content The World In Color has to offer. It has to be said, the story is mostly driven toward characters development and that's definitely gonna be a turn-off for those craving for those plot twists and cliff hangers but there is a plot and even though it has its own pace it always feels like it's progressing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development is where the story succeeded the most. What's interesting is that the characters' different personalities were well conveyed and are pretty easy to figure out except for the MC who has a more complex one. It's a good way to put her in relief to the others as it gives a meaning to her journey. Yuito is the disappointment of the cast, he's referenced as main character and definitely has a bigger place in the story than the other supports but doesn't have the quality or development to back it up. Shou and Kohaku are the highest quality people in the group and don't develop that much. Chigusa is the funny guy and also the youngest of the group, his personnality is pretty good even at his age but he's underused and doesn't develop much. Asagi and Kurumi have self-confidence issues and are working on it even though Kurumi is further down the road as she is older. \\n\\n\r\nA lot of things could be better but overall The World in Colors' characters are great. The quality of their interactions is not always as good though, especially for the romance parts. They can feel cringey even though there's a lot of maturity and life lessons in one of them. That's actually where Yuito's lack of quality and development drags the show down since there's nothing to justify his romance other than plot convenience. Fortunately, the show never takes it too far and that's what saves it again. Their moments of friendship are great though and make for very beautiful memories to be shared between the group. \\n\\n\r\nBut what really makes the show beautiful is the art and music. The opening is simply wonderful and the beauty of the panoramas, landscapes and magic really lives up to the title of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, The World in Color is a beautiful anime whose biggest strength is not trying too hard. Not devoid of flaws but so simple and genuine, the show makes for a good ride and definitely has things to bring to the anime culture.",

            "content": "Skip to the last part if you don\u2019t feel like reading! :) \r\n\tIrozuku Sekai no Ashita kara is an ethereal ride that takes its passengers into a spirited journey of friendship, love, and fantasy. A work that takes every bit of its precious time in development: starting from a mere wisp of a hatchling to eventually blooming into a majestic eagle capable of soaring wondrous heights and distances.Story 8/10\\n\r\nThe story circles around the lives of ordinary students; covering their day-to-day struggles and experiences while implicitly veering into the \u201cintimacy breeds passion\u201d sort of premise accompanied by the somewhat cliched love triangles common for many animes centered on growing adolescents. What makes this anime so wonderfully satisfying however, is the graceful interplay of everyday experiences with the beautiful element of magic. Magic, that oftentimes comes in modest forms, is unalike the flashy ones you\u2019d normally see on mainstream anime; for here, it is utilized in such a way where it affects the characters indirectly \u2013 where magic is present but not really \u2013 where it merely adds a sense of color to the lives of the characters and guides them in their development. It follows a very simple story line but presented in such an extraordinary way.\\n\r\n                                        Art 10/10\\n\r\nThis anime, at the very least, is a feast for the eyes. There are so many picturesque clips and shots that adds such a wonderful feel to the whole experience. The characters were also very well made and have simple but very satisfying designs. The magic portion of the art \u2013 although not expressively grand - was very pleasant and aesthetic as well. \\n\r\n\t                              Sound 10/10\\n\r\nAccompanied by the graceful artwork is a soft and mellow symphony of music that adds such a depth of feel and emotion to the conformity of the anime. The soundtrack creates such a gentle mood propelling every scene into feeling more warm and sensitive. It provides a perfect balance in constructing the whole vibe the anime was going for. \\n\r\n\t                             Characters 7/10\\n\r\nMany of the characters were very likable and enjoyable to watch. However, I feel as though they fell short in being memorable and leaving a mark, most likely because the cast were either too nice or too passive. I feel as though they could have introduced more color to the characters in a way that would make them stand out more. There were windows of opportunities where we could have seen more in depth understanding of the characters but often was it either short-lived or blandly displayed. Development-wise however was very good; the characters all showed a slow-phased growth \u2013 as they realistically should. It was also very fun to see their friendship and camaraderie flower into something that is just beautiful.\\n\r\n\t                           Overall  8/10\\n\r\nIrozuku Sekai no Ashita kara isn\u2019t for everybody. If you are looking for a detailed plot that steers away from the conventional, then this anime may not be for you. However, if you are interested in being swept away into a world brimming with wonder and beauty while still being relatable and warm; where characters go through common day-to-day dilemmas and struggles sprinkled with a bit of magic and fantasy then this anime might just be for you. \\n",

I was compelled to, after seeing the low rating and some of the reviews.\r\nI've watched a lot of anime, and I was personally offended by the low rating and the negative reviews. I'm taking it upon myself to strongly recommend the anime to those on the fence, it's definitely worth watching.\r\nThis show is best enjoyed when binged. This is partly what I blame for the low ratings. The development and impact of the anime is lost in the weekly format.\r\nThis is a feelzy atmospheric anime, it makes you feel good inside. I personally enjoyed the subtle romanceaspect of it the most. The anime gets very generic at some parts (mostly in the middle few episodes). But it's worth it to stick with it till the end. Try not to pick the plot apart, it's not about the plot as much (It's still a good plot, just not the most compelling plot), it's about the character development. The anime has a beautiful ambiance and a pleasant soundtrack. Character designs are downright gorgeous. The animation is spectacular.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're into subtle youthful love and romance, with a slight magical / fantasy element with some brilliant ambiance, this is the anime for you. I went into it with low expectations looking at the rating and the reviews. The fact that I'm going out of my way writing this review should give you an idea of how worth it it is to watch this anime. Highly recommended.",

            "content": "What would you do if one day your grandmother, who is also a mage, would come up to you and say she is going to send you 60 years into the past? This is the beginning of the story of Irozuku Sekai no Ashita kara, an anime where the colour blind Hitomi Tsukishiro gets send into the past to find her true self.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nIrozuku Sekai no Ashita kara starts in 2078 with Hitomi Tsukishiro who is at a festival looking at fireworks, thinking about the time she was watching them with her mother and could still see them in colour. She meets up with hergrandmother who pretty suddenly sends her 60 years into the past in order to experience a different kind of life. In 2018 Hitomi Tsukishiro lands in the house of Yuito Aoi, as her journey in another time starts. Sometimes she is able to see colour in this time, especially when she looks at Yuito's drawings, which is the only thing she sees in colour. The premise of Irozuku sets up for a pretty interesting story having to do with time travel, magic, colour blindness and the theme of finding yourself again. The story does have some inconsistencies, with its time travel for example and some random conveniences like Hitomi landing in the house of Yuito, even though you would probably land in the same place as where you left if you only travel through time. It is also pretty convenient that she can only see colour in Yuito's drawings, but this could maybe be explained by them being linked by magic or something similar. The story is also very slow in some episodes, making it feel more like a slice of life show with a bit of magic (in those episodes). The story does have some interesting themes to tell though. The theme of the difference between seeing colour or not is an interesting one for example, as the anime really shows the difference between seeing colour or not, as well as Hitomi's colour blindness having to do with her emotions. She probably unconsciously used magic on herself to make her colour blind, although it is not really explained. There is also the theme of going further with your life. After Hitomi's past experiences she has become stuck in the past, making her grandmother send her to the past, giving her the life experiences she needs to go further with her life and develop more. Conclusively, the story has an interesting premise, some inconsistencies and conveniences here and there, but overall has pretty good themes to tell.\\n\\n\r\nArt and animation: 9/10\\n\r\nThis anime looks very beautiful overall. You can see that P.A. Works put a lot of time in making the different backgrounds look very detailed, colourful and pretty beautiful.  Hitomi eventually is also able to enter the world of drawings in which she can see the colours. In these different drawings you can really see the work that has been put into making them look pretty special and beautiful, as well as putting some abstractness into the drawings.  There is also a good use of seeing the world in colour vs seeing the world from the perspective of Hitomi, when it is black and white. This also seen very well in the opening. The only real downside to the art and animation is the somewhat bad looking CGI used for some of the background characters and vehicles. Overall the animation is very beautiful and you can really see that a lot of effort has been put into it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nThe overall music used in the anime is very well done. The opening theme is pretty nice and shows the atmosphere of the anime well. The use of music throughout the anime itself is also well done, as it fits well with the different scenes. There was a lack of soundtracks which stood out to me though. The voice actors also did a pretty good job voicing the different emotions of the characters. This is especially seen with Hitomi, where you can clearly hear that she is pretty shy and with her grandmother in 2018, who sounds really energetic most of the time. Overall the sound in the anime is pretty well done.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10\\n\r\nAlthough Hitomi and Kohaku (Hitomi's grandmother (in 2018)) are pretty interesting characters and get some development, the other characters in the anime feel a bit one dimensional and often have conflicts which seem to be solved too quickly. One of the characters has a romance conflict for example, so Hitomi goes to her and talks a bit and she seems almost instantly over it afterwards. Yuito just likes to draw and does not seem to have any other interests in the anime and one of the characters randomly fall in love with Hitomi and does not seem to have any particular interests except liking photography. Hitomi is a pretty shy character and colour blind for many years, which she blames on her magic abilities. She looks to be stuck in the past and finds new friends and life experiences throughout the series, giving her world colour. She also gets better at her magic ability and stops hating on it. Kohaku is a pretty energetic character and often part of the more comedic moments of the anime. She makes for a pretty nice character and fits well in contrast to Hitomi. Overall the characters are decent, the main characters are pretty good, but the side characters are pretty one dimensional.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nOverall this anime was pretty enjoyable for me. It has an interesting premise, some nice character moments from the main characters a pretty good soundtrack and great animation to look at. Especially the moments in the world of the drawings were very enjoyable for me to watch due to its unique animation and special feeling it gave of. It was also interesting to think about how the time travelling would work out in the anime and it had a few interesting themes.\\n\\n\r\nBonus categories: 6/10\\n\r\n-----\\n\r\nRomance: 6/10\\n\r\nIf you like a lot of romantic progression, this anime is not the right one for you. You have the typical situation of one character liking another character, who likes another character, who likes another character. The main romance also does not really progress a lot, although the romance in the anime does make for a few nice moments.\\n\\n\r\nTragedy: 7/10\\n\r\nThe anime has plenty pretty tragic moments and heartwarming moments being able to make someone pretty emotional. It did not do it for me, but I can understand that many people were able to get emotional because of a few scenes in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nTime travel: 5/10\\n\r\nThe time travel in this anime was not very logical (which could be expected, because it is done with magic). It seemed as if there was only one timeline in the anime, as Kohaku in 2078 has the memories of meeting Hitomi in 2018. This seems weird, as Kohaku got the idea to send Hitomi to the past from meeting Hitomi in 2018. Without using alternate timelines this would result in a paradox, but if alternate timelines were used there would be the question of how Kohaku got the idea of sending Hitomi into the past in the first place. Besides that the time travel is also used very convenient for the plot (seen with Hitomi landing in Yuito's room when he almost enters the room for example).\\n\r\n-----\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nIrozuku Sekai no Ashita kara is a pretty good anime overall. It has an interesting premise and a story with some inconsistencies and conveniences, but some very interesting themes. It also has great art and animation and a pretty good soundtrack. The main characters were pretty interesting, although the side characters were a bit one dimensional. It also had some romance and some tragic moments. However, its time travel aspect could be improved on. All and all it was a pretty good and enjoyable anime.",

            "content": "Quick summary of the review : \r\nIn my opinion Irozuku Sekai no Ashita kara turned out to just be an okay show with pretty visuals, and could have been better if its main focus was on only one theme : 13 episodes weren't enough to develop all the things (friendship, romance, drama moments) they wanted to.\r\nArt :\r\nThe visuals are pretty : the sceneries are beautiful and the scenes with magic are well done. The colors in this show have quite a big importance and the scenes where they are particularly meaningful are gorgous.  My only regret on this is that I find their facesa little weird (their eyes).\\n\\n\r\nSound :\\n\r\nThe OST are not bad, but I didn't hear one that I particularly liked. However, I can say that they made efforts with the sound effects.\\n\\n\r\nStory, character and enjoyment :\\n\r\nThis section contains a general description of how the anime is developped, and as such may contains spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nAfter watching the last episode of Irozuku Sekai no Ashita kara, I'm under the impression that this show was trying to development too many subjects at once, resulting in a feeling that it was all over the place :\\n\\n\r\nIndeed, there are 3 main themes that are easily identifiable in this anime : friendship, romance and Hitomi's evolution.\\n\r\nIn my opinion this anime is aiming to be quite 'serious' (you wouldn't take this show as lightly as a romcom or a slice of life anime, for example), and from episode 1 you can already guess that there will be really sad moment near the end. However, Irozuku is only 13 episodes long : it's difficult to properly develop these themes within such a short time and keeping with the high expectations of the viewer. And this is where lies the problem :\\n\\n\\n\r\n*********** if you absolutely do not want to be spoiled skip this part ***********\\n\\n\r\nThe final episode contains a scene where it's the time of farewells between Hitomi and her friends. This scene is the climax in terms of feels, but I had trouble to feel the sadness as the relationship between the characters isn't fully developped throughout the season, and thus it's difficult to feel the bond between them because in the end we don't know characters well. Nonetheless, this scene is still quite intense but it could have been way, way better if they properly built the feels up to this point.\\n\r\nMaybe they didn't want to finish on a too sad ending? The rest of the episode focuses on Hitomi who has clearly accepted that she leaved her friends and keeps them as precious memories, and is already taking steps towards a new future for her, where she gained more confidence and is able to fully appreciate life.\\n\\n\r\nThe same thing is true for the romance, as it is born kind of out of nowhere (it was not an instant love for the two sides) between Hitomi and Yuito. I didn't saw them fall in love with each other progressively : I'm under the impression that they just admitted that they have feeling for each other at some point of the show. There are others romance in the group but they are so underdevelopped that they are not worth mentionning.\\n\\n\r\nThere is also the problem with Hitomi's monochromatic vision that is not fully explained by the end of the series : the source of this is probably a magic unconsciously casted by Hitomi on herself as conjectured by Kohaku. In the end it's finally dispelled, and it's easy to deduce that it's because she finally relearned how to appreciate life. \\n\r\nHowever we still don't know how it was casted, and why there are moments where it's quite selectively cancelled, like the moment where the fireworks are launched at the end of the school festival : why are the fireworks the only things that Hitomi sees in color at that moment? Shouldn't at least her friend also be, since she mentionned that she feels happy that she could do something with them?\\n\\n\r\n************************* end of potential spoilers ************************\\n\\n\\n\r\nIn contrary, the development of Hitomi's personnality from the beginning to the end is quite good, although it feels a little lacking : we witness Hitomi growing more and more accustomed to her new surroundings (and her new friends) and taking more initiatives compared to her old self.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end this show still is enjoyable but it isn't as good as it could have been.",

            "content": "So much wasted potential...\r\nYou can tell that Irozoku was trying for the feels, similar to series like Anohana or Angel Beats, however, it couldn't quite reach that point. Not to say that it was bad. It just didn't draw the viewer in enough to make me invested in any of the characters. Therefore, I didn't feel anything during the climax of the story. Perhaps I'm just heartless, but that's truly what I experienced when watching this show.\r\n*Non-Spoiler Review*\r\nThe series was going for a beautiful lifetime experience that develops the characters in a positive way, with a touching and emotional climax. While it isn't anything new,I still appreciated the fact that a series of this format was made. Yet, sadly, this series wasn't able to fully deliver on that experience. Perhaps it lacked time, but personally, I think that the later episodes just turned out to be too mellow. With an interesting premise such as this, I think they could have done a lot more with the story to make it engaging.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is very good, and is probably the best thing about this anime. You can clearly tell that the animators put in a lot of work to make this look good, and it does.\\n\\n\r\nTo me, the characters lacked any real depth to them, which is probably why I couldn't invest myself in them. They're all just generally far too nice to be human, and that ends up being detrimental to the purpose of the story.\\n\\n\r\nSad to say that this anime couldn't deliver on what I expected from reading the synopsis. If you haven't seen any shows of this nature, then maybe this anime is a good start. However, if you've seen any of the anime I mentioned previously, or any other anime that I haven't mentioned which have a similar premise, then I would recommend watching something else. It's a nice anime to look at, but not one to enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading this review!",

            "content": "The theme of transience is often expressed in Japanese culture as \"mono no aware.\" For the uninitiated, mono no aware is roughly translated as \"the pathos of things,\" a Zen mood essential to several Japanese traditions, such as hanami (cherry blossom viewing). Both Ozu and Shinkai heavily transmit the concept, but one of my favourite examples of mono no aware in cinema is in Edward Yang's Yi Yi. There's a part in which NJ, the father of the Jian family on whom the film focuses, spends a whole 24 hours exploring Tokyo with his ex-lover during a business trip. They walk through a shrine, bythe beach, on the streets, all the while catching each other up on their lives since they had last been together and, eventually, talking over their past romance, its dissolution, and the resulting emotional trauma. It's a brilliant illustration of mono no aware, as even though the two reflect on the past, they are portrayed in this time as their selves, in the current, in their respective lives, having grown apart. Irozuku attempts to arouse this same wistful projection of the past onto the moment of the now in a very strange, roundabout manner.\\n\\n\r\nThe premise of Irozuku is convoluted in the sense that it combines two frameworks, time traveling and school life, as a means to a telos not commonly seen in either. The two employ elements already at odds with each other. Time travel imbues a story with dramatic irony and direction by establishing an ending inherent in the beginning: the audience knows the time traveler must inevitably return to their timeline. School anime tend to be slice of life comedies, which is a genre known for being relaxed and intentionally aimless. Perhaps, when watching Irozuku, you might wonder: \"Where is this going?\" For most of its run, the show does indeed feel directionless, to the point where the thematic components seem haphazardly stitched together, but by the final episode, it's made apparent that the colour motif, the magical time travel setup, and the aimless pacing all serve a purpose.\\n\\n\r\nColours, or the concept of, are undoubtedly the selling point of the show as they are the root of Hitomi's internal conflict. With such seemingly obvious symbolism, the gut reaction is immediately to decode it. However, Irozuku is a little shrewd, and the most obvious readings (depression, emotions, love, etc.) are red herrings on closer inspection. Colours don't really \"represent\" anything in particular; they serve as a visual cue to the audience that Hitomi is unable to experience. Full stop. Her complete achromatopsia severs her from experiencing the phenomenon of the moment. She's so wrapped up in her own preconceptions of her relationships with others that she is unable to see colour (and by extension, she is also unable to produce magic, which is viewed in this universe as a means to help, and thereby connect with, other people). It's a dramatic manifestation of her psyche, but intelligible nonetheless. Theoretically, this show wouldn't have worked as a book, since the visual euphemism is so crucial. During scenes in which we see through Hitomi's eyes, the contrast of the vibrant palette against the monochromatic world enhances the exuberance of the moment by sucking the audience into the graphic instant.\\n\\n\r\nThe knowledge that Hitomi must return to the future by the end is kind of a wink to the audience about the ephemerality of youth. We know that Hitomi's time with the Magic Photography Arts Club is limited, which makes the experience much more somber. Yet she ultimately finds meaning in her time with the club, and the fruits of her time traveling emerge in the final episode in which she and her elderly grandmother Kohaku \"reminisce\" about their shared school days. This uncanny, almost bizarre scene conflates Hitomi's past and present self quite literally; the 60-year-old photos of Hitomi with the Magic Photography Arts Club are skimmed by present day Hitomi, who has only aged a couple of weeks since then. The juxtaposition of Kohaku's genuine nostalgia against Hitomi's newfound awareness for her own \"present\" evokes plaintive rumination in a manner suggestive of the mono no aware of the aforementioned scene from Yi Yi.\\n\\n\r\nThe endgame of catharsis you expect from a show like this isn't really the point, rather the point is that the individual moments matter even though you know there will eventually be an end to them, as youth is in fact fleeting. That's why the banal, slice of life events that actually happen in the show seem like they weren't \"going anywhere\": they weren't. The romances, the hangouts, the club affairs, none of it really matters in regard to building up to a narrative climax. What matters is that they actually happened so Hitomi had something to look back at sentimentally and feel like she truly enjoyed experiencing.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the stories comprising Hitomi's experiences in the past aren't very engaging, or at the very least, I'm unable to recall most of them. There were a couple of memorable moments, like the scene in which the club runs across a bridge in an attempt for a photo op with a night cruise, or even some of the mundane shots of some of the characters walking and talking against the streetlit night. But these glimpses into transient youth were few and far between. Most of the vignettes were too goal-oriented and relied too much on tired school cliches, which is a poor decision when the bulk of the narrative relies on such moments. Maybe Irozuku's aimlessness would have felt more justified had it more moments of genuine humanity.",

            "content": "Irozuku Sekai no Ashita Kara was interesting and full of emotion. And as expected, it was full of color. \r\nStory: The story had an interesting premise, but didn't really deliver to it's full potential throughout the anime. It was rather slow paced, and it focused more on the characters for the first half of the season. We're introduced to the main character, she's abruptly sent into the past, she makes a few friends and they basically hang out for a few episodes without many events. The second part of the show picked up a bit and became more interesting, which merits the story a fairrating as the plot got much better in the final episodes.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art was very pleasing, very colorful, despite the main character's lack of ability to see color. The animation was smooth and the backgrounds were delightful and helped to build the world that the story occurred in. My only complaints were the inconsistencies with anatomy and the style the characters were drawn in- at times they appeared almost cross eyed because of the way the eyes were animated and the noses had a strange splotch of light on them constantly. Other than those things, the art was very good.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The opening was short and catchy, as well as the ending concluding each episode well. They both fit well with the show's visuals. On the last episode they played a song that wasn't the opening or the ending and it was wonderfully done and placed perfectly. The songs were enjoyable and they flowed with the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: This show focused mainly on the characters, so writing them well was really important to the success of it. Hitomi, the main character, is rather distant and aloof, which was fitting for her place in the show. She showed good character development throughout as she began to open up her friends and become more confident and social. The other characters were done well too; they were each distinct and unique people. Throughout the rather slow first half of the season, we get to know them and their relationships with each other.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I was rather disappointed with the show at first. It lacked the luster and excitement that I had seen in the trailer. I did come to enjoy it more towards the end, when the plot was able to really shine and the well-built characters were able to complete their arcs. It was a bittersweet experience as well- it didn't give us the happy ending we all expected, but something else, something that made it much more unique and valuable. So, overall I think the show was worth watching. The last episode was my favorite and it really concludes the show well, so if you can make it through the rather boring introductions, you can enjoy the bittersweet and emotionally moving end.",

            "content": "This is a review with only minor to no spoilers (only for the very first episode or details that really don't spoiler the story).\r\nIrozuku is a pretty nice show with a good art and a very different story to what I'm used to and I liked it although it has some little flaws.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nI liked the story a lot. It starts in the future but ends up being mostly set in our time. Where the protagonist named Hitomi was sent to by her grandmother. So she ends up in a time where her grandmother is about the same age as her and where she issupposed to learn a few things about the world and herself that might help her in her life.\\n\r\nThe world where Hitomi lives in is almost like ours with the difference that magic is something pretty normal and there are things like magic supply shops and even some magic tools for people who aren't magicians. Hitomi and her grandmother both are witches but Hitomi doesn't like magic very much.\\n\r\nI like the world concept and that the show is set in a different time than the one the protagonist belongs in.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nNothing much to say here. The art is really nice and sometimes pretty colorful and feels somehow gentle to me. It adds a bittersweet and calm feeling to the show which I also liked a lot. All the characters are nicely drawn (in my opinion) and so is the whole world - especially the city lights at night look nice. I've seen anime with a more impressive art style but I think this is one of the best when it comes to the art.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack: 7/10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is nice and fits the show and the scenes well but as for me it wasn't that memorable. The opening and ending both are good as well and also fit the show but they aren't going to become my favorite opening/ending.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\r\nThe characters were quite decent in my opinion, not bad but still not exceptionally good. I found all the protagonists likable and many of them get some character development, especially the female main character. I particularly loved to see how Hitomi developed with her attitude towards herself and towards others but I also liked to watch Kohaku trying to get better at magic all the time and the developments of Yuito and Asagi were also enjoyable (especially when it comes to their interaction with other people).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nI liked how it felt to watch this show and see how the story progresses and the characters develop although it was quite predictable at times. Furthermore I loved how there were always some scenes that I thought were impressive with their great art and nice feeling - especially when we get to see some magic, city views or nice drawings and photo motives. I really think that the main problem with this show was the predictability and that I enjoyed it but didn't think of it as very exciting. I didn't feel the need to watch every episode as soon as it aired because it didn't give me the excitement of how the story would develop but most of the time I watched it the same day nonetheless just because of that great enjoyment and feeling of content that this show brought to me.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, when I started to watch this show on the day it started to air I really didn't think that I would enjoy it so much, that was one of my greatest 2018 anime surprises. Especially since I normally prefer watching anime with more action in it, which - let's be honest - isn't the case at all for this show.\\n\r\nAnyone who is considering to give it a try I can just say do it, even if you don't like it as much as I did I don't think you'll truly regret watching it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's a 8/10 for me!",

            "content": "\u201cIf you weren\u2019t able to see colours, then maybe you would come to appreciate what\u2019s more important standing in front of you\u201d \r\nThat\u2019s one of the messages I got from watching Irozuku Sekai no Ashita kara.\r\nThis is a show about discovering oneself, overcoming your fears and embracing every part of you. As I\u2019ve watched other romance anime that have touched on similar themes and I think have executed them better (for example Your lie in April or Your name), I have to say this anime does not hold up in comparison. In fact, Irozuku Sekai is similar to Violet Evergarden where the story is reallysurface level and it\u2019s carried by the pretty colours because it\u2019s lacking substance. \\n\\n\r\nPlot (4/10):\\n\r\nA quiet, lonely girl named Hitomi is a descendant from a family of mages. Hitomi\u2019s colour blind for unknown reasons. She is transported to the past by her grandmother Kohaku in order to rediscovery herself. This is where she becomes friends with a younger Kohaku and her classmates (because the girl is incapable of doing so in her own timeline). Her she meets a boy who\u2019s able to bring colour to her dull and grey life. \\n\\n\r\nThe premise is your typical, cliche romance series. Literally, after watching the first episode you\u2019d be able to decipher where the story is going because it\u2019s so generic and predictable.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is thin. There weren\u2019t any interesting sub-plots or twists that made the story more engaging. It felt like the writer knew what he wanted to do in the first and last episodes, and the middle was just padding which amounted to filler to \u2018creating memories\u2019 for Hitomi. \\n\\n\r\nThe pacing was slow at the beginning and a whole lot of nothing was happening. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (5/10): \\n\r\nHitomi is a bland, quiet girl with virtually no personality. You could replace her with a mannequin in the beginning and there wouldn\u2019t be any difference.  \\n\r\nShe\u2019s a generic dandere. The way Hitomi is written at times is as if she\u2019s had the worst life ever, like she\u2019s a victim who\u2019s been abused her entire life. I may be exaggerating, but it annoyed me how much her friends had to baby and walk on egg shells around her at the beginning. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, Hitomi does grow throughout the show. The journey to the past helped Hitomi rediscovery herself. Hitomi got over her depression and became more self confident. She regained her love for magic once again. Hitomi discovered a world full of colours, which long plagued her grey existence. Hitomi found a purpose and overcame the problems she would normally run away from (finding friends, love, reconciling with her mother).\\n\\n\r\nKohaku is a fun, outgoing, confident girl- basically the exact opposite to Hitomi and a far more interesting character in my opinion.  \\n\\n\r\nAoi is the lonely art boy who falls in love with Hitomi. The underlying reason is because they brought colour into their lonely, dull lives. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the main cast are so basic and undeveloped that I don\u2019t feel like talking about them individually. I felt like I didn\u2019t know anything about them except for a few character traits. You\u2019ll end up forgetting them once the season\u2019s over anyway.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation & Sound (7/10): \\n\r\nOne of the shows highlights is the animation was stunning. The backgrounds & scenery were detailed. The bright colour scheme made the world feel vibrant and full of life. \\n\\n\r\nThe music was beautifully composed. I especially like the opening song. That being said, pretty colours isn\u2019t enough to make up for the lack of substance. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (5/10):\\n\r\nThe series isn\u2019t as good as everyone makes it out to be. The story and characters aren\u2019t complex, it has cliche troupes you see in romance anime e.g. love triangles. Magic is never defined well in this world. Hitomi and Kohaku are mages capable of using magic because plot. The fact that Hitomi may be causing a time paradox the more she messes with characters/events is a issue rarely if ever mentioned. \\n\\n\r\nSpoilers:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe ending was underwhelming.\\n\\n\r\nDid Club President x Asagi a ship in the future? Did Glasses girl go to college? What ever happened to Aoi? Did he move on and find someone else? \\n\\n\r\nThis was a poor conclusion to our club members. I would\u2019ve have preferred learning more about them from pictures in the time capsule or meeting the older versions.\\n\\n\r\nAoi was a bland love interest. Him and Hitomi\u2019s relationship lacked chemistry. When they said they loved each other it came across forced and felt like they were jumping a few steps because they didn\u2019t progress much as friends. Hell, they never even kissed. The other relationships were underdeveloped too. For example, the Club President x Hitomi, club president x Asagi also didn\u2019t feel anything more than friends.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s a lot of bad writing in this show. It\u2019s a overhyped, mediocre romance anime.",

            "content": "I've come to a point where I have little to no patience for sitting through mediocre anime anymore, why? Simply because there is a vast ocean of other series that I could be watching that are actually good. I don't have to waste my time trudging in the filth that is produced season to season by the anime industry.\r\nThe question I ask myself today is, how in the hell did this anime manage to hook me in for nine episodes with my current mindset!? Maybe it was the pretty colors, maybe it was my blind faith in P.A. Works, maybe it was my want tofill a vacancy for the anime I was watching at the time, I have no clue. What I do know is that Irozuku is not good, it doesn't warrant your time nor patience, and you can find plenty of anime better than it without much effort.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I want to say that Irozuku isn't horrible. If it caters to your likes then there may be a chance that you actually enjoy this series. But then I would have to ask, what exactly are your likes? Is it a mundane cast of characters? Spearheaded by the MC, Hitomi Tsukishiro, who is a walking Shrinking Violet trope? What about the uninspired character designs that would make stick figures look like masterpieces in comparison? Oh, I know!!! It's those mesmerizing rainbow colors that put you in a trance. Well..... wake up and smell the coffee!!! You have been bamboozled, swindled, fooled by the \"feels\" and by the potential of this series that seems more nonexistent the more episodes you watch.\\n\\n\r\nSo, I read the synopsis and seeing that magic was normal in the world of Irozuku, I was intrigued and eager to see what that would lead to. Long story short, it led to nothing, at least up till episode nine. Magic in this world is nothing more than a gimmick. While magic is kinda necessary given the fact that Hitomi is sent 60 years in the past, the concept of magic could have been written out of the story with not much changing. I'm not mad that magic is in the series, I'm just disappointed that it didn't enhance anything when it had the promise to.\\n\\n\r\nGetting into the main plot of Irozuku, we are supposed to be following Hitomi and her growth as a individual. Hitomi is crippling shy, so the mission is to break Hitomi out of her shell so she can get out there and make friends. Being an introvert myself (albeit not to the same degree), I kinda relate to Hitomi. As a character, Hitomi starting where she was makes sense because it leaves room to grow, but mannnn is she boring. Sure, you can argue that Hitomi is a realistic character but that doesn't make her journey any less dull. Pair that with the show's sluggish pace and it makes Hitomi's uneventful adventure (Jojo reference) more apparent. It also doesn't help that the supporting characters can't disguise Hitomi's blandness since, they themselves are pretty bland as well, excluding Kohaku. Going back to Hitomi, I feel like the growth for her character is there, but it's happening too gradually. Yes, it is better to ease into development than to rush it, but considering that this series is only 13 episodes, and the fact that it's suffering because of this almost hesitant maturation, I say hit the gas and let's get rolling. There is also needless drama in this show but because I risk spoiling part of the series by expanding on this, I will refrain from talking about specifics. Let's just say that the romance triangles, squares, and pentagons, are played out.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said before this series is not horrible, I save that label for shows that are practically torture to watch which Irozuku isn't. This series had it's good moments, maybe even a good episode. I joked about it, but this series is\u00a0 visually appealing (character designs are a different story). The contrast of the monochrome seen through Hitomi and the myriad of the colors that this series throws at you make for a good combination aesthetically. This series lives up to the name \"The World in Colors.\" I also found some of the club member's interactions pretty funny when they went on trips, it's a shame that we didn't have more of that. The last thought I want to add is that I enjoyed Kohaku. I thought it was cool that Hitomi's future grandmother was the catalyst for Hitomi's growth and that she would give advice from the perspective of a 17 year old, while still being wise and helpful. \\n\\n\r\nTo close this review out, I want to say, make your own decision on whether or not you watch this show. Make your own decision on whether or not you like this show, just be prepared for a slow burn, that may not have a grand reward at the end. Not every rainbow has a pot of gold at the end. (I'm sorry but I couldn't resist not making a rainbow joke, I'll leave now).",

This will be an honest opinion about a mislabeled show following a forceful viewing of almost 8 episodes.\r\nI'd rather watch the horrendous CGI of Black Clover than finish this show. I have no clue as to why I bothered watching this many episodes. This is how I feel about it. It's a joke and an insult of a show.\r\nThe only redeeming quality of this anime is it's decent art style. That is all. I can't find anything else.\r\nThe story:\r\nA sad female brick does not see colors. It's manufacturer (the grandmother) sends it back intotime without explanation. Nothing else happens.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nPleasant.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nDid not notice so I gave it a 1/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter/s:\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nA solid 10/10. And the best part about it is that it's slow to develop, at least for me. No other show made me write a \"review\", granted, I haven't seen that many. It started with promise. The first episode was interesting and the first I've seen that tackles color blindness. It then, gradually, made me angrier and angrier. This is as boring as it can get. Nothing happens and I'm sure nothing will happen if I watch it till the end. There is no enjoyment to be had in this. I called the MC a brick but it's an insult to bricks. I'd rather watch the f*cking grass grow.\\n\\n\r\nNow then, on to the mislabeling. There is no drama in the show. There is nothing romantic in the show. The magic is secondary but I don't know to what. \\n\r\nYou can probably argue that the romance is budding and that the characters are shy and to that I say go f*ck yourself. \\n\\n\r\nIf you have a fetish for stone bricks and for emotionally stale environments this is the show for you. I assure you that nothing will happen in it.\\n\\n\r\nIf you still have functioning brain cells and value your time please stay away from this utter garbage.",

            "content": "*Spoiler Free Review*\r\nI told myself not to write anything about this anime but i couldnt help it and wrote in the forum, now writing here.\r\nIrozuku Sekai no Ashita Kara has a strange setting. You cant really find a similar setting in any other anime. Thats why it made it really interesting and unique at the beginning. But as the anime continued, i started to see many cliches. There were love triangles that didnt contribute to the story ( it did contribute something, but it wasnt expressed well ) there was some school cliches that you can find in any shoujo anime. Thats why i gotbored in some episodes, or i watched it with any significant enjoyment. But overally i liked watching it, the story wasnt something i will remember for years but it was something that i could watch to spend some free time. \\n\r\nBut there is one problem. \\n\r\nThis anime *could* be an anime i would remember for years. \\n\r\nI think the main problem was the characters. I liked the characters and i think they were interesting. But it was only at first. There was Chigusa, the funny boy. I really wanted to see more from him, but after the first half of the anime he was mostly a side character that was there to fill the scene. I really wanted to see the relationship between Chigusa and Kurumi. Also Kurumi had a potential too but they mentioned about her character only in one episode (and not in the entire episode), after that she was a side character too. Shou, the captain the *supposedly* gentleman... he was nice but after some time he just felt like an empty character. \\n\r\nAsagi was a cute girl. Kohaku seemed like an okay character from beginning to the end. They didnt make her empty or enhance her character but she had some character development. \\n\r\nHitomi did have nice character development. But i should be honest at first she seemed like a boring character even though i like silent characters. \\n\r\nI think my favorite character was Yuito. \\n\r\nThe anime revolves around the characters, because the characters started not to feel good after some point, the anime also started to feel not good enough. To sum up, the anime had really good potential and really good setup ( the first episodes ) but then rushed many things, skipped character development for many characters thats why felt incomplete in may ways.\\n\r\nEverything was going on like this and the last three episodes started... \\n\r\nThey again had some issues but i really like the message that they tried to give at the end. I like how the anime was more like Anohana rather than a classic shoujo anime. I really felt the emotions in the last episode. I really cant describe how it made me feel. I hadnt been this emotional after an anime for a long time. \\n\r\nThats another reason why i am angry at this anime.\\n\r\nIt could be much much better, it wasted its resources though still made me feel this much. I cant imagine how i would feel if this anime didnt have this many flaws. \\n\r\nAlso even though ending was successful, it had something missing which devastated me emotionally. I think it was a flaw though they shouldnt leave it like that. I cant tell what it is here since it would be a big spoiler.\\n\\n\r\nStory-8 (great potential but mostly wasted)\\n\r\nCharacters-6 (again good potential but wasted)\\n\r\nEnjoyment-6\\n\\n\r\nI need to add a new section (lol) I think the best part of the anime was the relationship between Yuito and Hitomi and what their problems were, how they managed to overcome them. I have to add this though, even these had the same issues i talked above but less.\\n\r\nYuito-Hitomi Parts-8 \\n\\n\r\nArt was great. Especially the sceneries were awesome. Not as good as violet evergarden though.\\n\r\nArt-9\\n\\n\r\nThere were some musics i liked but there wasnt anything outstanding\\n\r\nEdit: Later i started to love the ending and the opening music\\n\r\nSound-7\\n\\n\r\nI was going to give 6 overally but after watching the latest episodes i decided to give 7\\n\r\nOverall-7",

            "content": "What the show deserved: 6/10\r\nWhat I gave it: 7\r\nWhat drew me in initially was mainly the fact that it was from P.A Works and I'm still looking for the next Nagi no Asukara. Add to it the bright colors, the fact the main lead couldn't see them and time travel, I got massively hyped.\r\nThe initial dialogue was my first clue: she starts talking about loving colors, and then proceeds to list a bunch of them. That adequately sums up the anime, I'd say. It could be deep, could have depth, but it falls flat.\r\nArt & Sound:\r\nThis is the real reason I'm giving this anime a7 and not a 6. The production value was high, with wonderful use of the color palette and even the middle episodes didn't have massive drops in animation as shows tend to do. The music was also soothing, fit the atmosphere, and in some points actually did manage to tug some heartstrings; I have absolutely no complaints. \\n\\n\r\nStory & Characters:\\n\r\nThe story premise was unique. As the show says, time travel and a lack of color just sounds like you could have a real digging of the mind, depth not many anime tend to have. Unfortunately, it didn't meet my high hopes by any means. It ended up being one of school drama and love triangles that we've seen so many times before.\\n\\n\r\nWhat surprised me was just how many characters they had. And here's where things get interesting. By having such a long list of main-ish cast members, you either end up stereotyping everyone to the point of inducing migraines, or you  focus on one or two of them, to the expense of everyone else. Either way you'd expect some massive ignoring to happen.\\n\\n\r\nInstead, they actually divided time up between everyone relatively evenly. I found this quite an achievement, and each of the SEVEN leads actually managed to leave a mark and, get this, NOT IRRITATE THE VIEWER. Don't get me wrongs, everyone was a stereotype, but not bash-my-skull-in, gouge-out-my-eyes level.\\n\\n\r\nThis also lead to the focus NOT being on the main characters. Although the story is about Hitomi, and her infatuation with Yuito, I didn't really feel that either of them were really in my face - a pro and possibly a con. I found it interesting. \\n\\n\r\nThat space though left much to be wanted. There had to be a depth to fill the lack of focus. Either it should have focused on the relationship with her grandmother, entirely on her grandmother, maybe more time with friends, with an intense look at everyone's problems.\\n\\n\r\nSo the problems were just that: zero depth. Just as soon as you felt something was about to develop, they were just left for another story line, or a different character. It never let me get absorbed in anything. I do appreciate that not every character shown has to have a massive impact on the story (e.g. the random older sister, or the graduated senpai. Neither added to the story, but their existence helped add detail to the world.)\\n\\n\r\nI must admit, the end was quite well done, but I only wish it reflected the rest of the show. In the end it just left me wanting more. They didn't mess anything up, per say, but there was nothing special, it lacked that extra mile, and a wonderfully set stage was left untapped and unexplored.\\n\\n\r\nHere's the bottom line:\\n\r\nIf you enjoy slice of life, and a dash of relatively well-done romance, with 8.5/10 animation, watch this, by all means. It really is a great way to spend your time. I didn't feel myself itching to get back to watching it when I was somewhere else, but watching it was peaceful. Nice. Nothing fancy, just nice.\\n\\n\r\nBut don't go into it thinking your life will change, because it certainly won't.",

            "content": "Irozuki Sekai no Ashita kara is a very simple show with very simple characters. Hitomi has some serious family problems. She doesn't cares about anything and feels responsible for what her mother gone through. Through the power of magic, she goes to the past to her grandma's generation to rekindle her emotions. \r\nStory: 6\r\nStory was fairly simple with Hitomi joining a club that she felt comfortable and finding friendships and romance in it. But she has to return to the future some day and abandon the friendships forged in this timeline.\r\nArt: 10\r\nArt was astonishing especially since the story was about pictures, there were amazing artworksall around. Animation was also on point especially during scenes where they animate ''real life'' and ''paintings''. Most people were probably attracted firsthand due to the art.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter :6\\n\r\nCharacters were very ordinary honestly, with love triangles happening in the clique and having natural ships (3girls and 3 guys). \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nMost people would be satisfied with how the story unfolds, seeing Hitomi being someone who don't want to make any relationships with others to actually loving someone. Also, the Photography club makes Hitomi feels like home and treat her like family. She eventually undergone a lot of character development and by the end of the series, she becomes that cheerful girl everyone wants her to be, all thanks to the people back in the past\\n\\n\r\nOverall :7\\n\r\nWhy did I rate it so low even though everything seems good? Because of the potential wasted from this anime. Lots of things in the anime was not fully or not clearly explained. Many important events were summarised and was a 20seconds speech by the character. There were so many scenes which could make the audience become even more engrossed with the story and characters, which I really feel sad that they didn't adapt it. The ending scene was also done well but was underwhelming. Most would expect an Ano Hana type of goodbye but it was really below expectations.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the anime has been a great watch even with its shortcomings. Really makes you think back to those good times you had in your school clubs and with your school mates. Art was totally awesome so it is definitely worth it to check it out.",

Iroduku: The World in Colors is not very original or out-of-the-box. For me, it was more of a way to pass the time. I love the magic, mage, modern, and art-focus aspect of the anime but from the first two episodes, you can basically predict the flow of the episode sequence. I mostly enjoyed the high-quality visuals and \"cookie-cutter\" character development. The flow is slow and clean. For some reason, Hitomi's and all the girl faces have a perpetual blush.

I felt so many things while watching it, I don't know how to put it in words. Let's begin...\r\nStory (9/10):\r\nI'm not going to explain what is this about because you can read it on the anime page. A simply time travel story full of feelings and mysteries to solve about why that happened.\r\nArt (8/10):\r\nIt's not a perfect animation, but it's P.A. Works, and so it hadto be a really beautiful one. Colors are pretty fantastic, and character designs aren't the best, but a simple and cute design that maybe make them look more like humans? \\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10):\\n\r\nMaybe the plus of this anime. A precious opening and a pretty good ending with some beautiful tracks at the perfect moment to play them. Not the best, but still amazing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (7/10):\\n\r\nAh... It hurts. I didn't want to put a 7 out of 10 to my dearest ones. But I finished a bit disappointed at the end. The best trait is that they are simply... humans. Like humans, they tend to shut up when they must shout out what they feel, but... They keep quiet too much. And so make them too simple. I'm sorry for that, but after all, I know I will remember some of the characters one year later, and that's the reason why I still like them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10):\\n\r\nI have felt like crying, really angry one second later I felt so happy, and the most important: so so so so excited! It's been a long time since I felt that for the last time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10): \\n\r\nA really beautiful story which has its mistakes, but so enjoyable if you like romance, drama and magic elements.",

Oh yes, i must mention this show have so many still shot (looks great for background art drawing, but maybe not good for animated show). As i said earlier this show is about the art of drawing, the beauty of the world, and the joy of doing work for someone. \r\nPersonally i'm very enjoyed watching this, i love art, this is very beautiful. The OP & ED is verynice, also i love the character design.\\n\\n\r\nThis show not for everyone, if you looking for beautiful art, come watch. But if you care about story & character, you will bit disappointed. Because the story & character is following the art direction (usually the art that follow character & story).",

            "content": "P.A. Works continually produces exciting and good content. I loved Shirobako, Sakura Quest, Angel Beats!, Charlotte, among many others. So my excitement was no less after watching the trailer for Irozuku Sekai no Ashita kara.\r\nTo be fair, the premise is good. It's a captivating and intriguing idea, using time travel to benefit and improve one's self, and I thought that the personal battles of Hitomi were original and enticing enough to get me to watch.\r\nHowever, that's where the line is drawn in terms of where the anime succeeded. Unfortunately, I think that the execution was quite poor.\r\nThe characters fall short in depth and personality. It'squite hard to grasp the intentions and motivations for any of them. Each character's personality, especially Hitomi, seems quite flat. The most exciting character to me, Kohaku, is still a typical vibrant and motivated character that you see in most anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast of characters that make up the Magic Arts Photography Club (one of the focal points in the series) get left in the dust in terms of fruitful character development. The series tries to tell you that they each improve along with Hitomi in their own personal development, but it's hard to see. I commonly mistake one of the male characters for the others since they're so bland.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is fine. It's a bit different from most P.A. Works animation styles. I'm not a huge fan of the character designs--I think the facial proportions are a bit weird--but the environment is pretty well-designed and the colors are brought out beautifully.\\n\\n\r\nI think that the series tries to make up for the lack of character depth with emotional storytelling, but it's not enough. In the moments where the characters embrace something about themselves or share an emotional moment of triumph and understanding, I'm left wondering why these characters are so emotional after being so reserved in the other scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThe intertwining of magic with a slice of life premise was confusing at times. Unlike well-executed magic slice of life series like Flying Witch, the use of magic in this series tends to be more of a distraction rather than naturally blending in with the story. I didn't expect the series to explain to us the fundamentals and origins of magic in that world, but I also think that it could have benefited from a more structured magic system. For example, Kohaku believes that Hitomi has some sort of \"unconscious\" magic that she is consistently using, but it's not very clear what the nature of that is.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this series was a disappointment for me. I'm hoping that it gets adopted into another medium, like a light novel or manga, so that the story can be more flushed out.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "There were two anime this season that really were tackling the concept of depression. One hit it out of the park, and this one, did okay. Visually, this is a feast for the eyes. Even when you switch into the protagonist's black and white point of view, every frame is gorgeous. But the story itself is a mixed bag. \r\nMy issues with the story are many fold.  First, and foremost, the romance in this show just doesn't feel all that real.  The leads don't really have bonding moments that feel organic.  Second, for most of the show the conflicts are really juststandard high school drama. The fantastical elements mostly fall into the background until late in the season. To the show's credit, the characters deal with these situations in realistic and mature fashion, but high school drama is not all that enthralling. \\n\\n\r\nNow an area of conflict that could have used more is the psychological issues of the two leads, and how they help each other cope with them. Hitomi's colorblindness is a manifestation of depression and shame for being a mage. That is a really interesting concept, but many episodes push this into the background when they could have easily had this narrative push the show through the entire season. The male lead's (his name slipped my mind, he was that memorable) hang ups about his art also could have been an interesting thread to explore, but it kind of just resolves itself for the silliest of reasons. \\n\\n\r\nStill, there are moments in this anime that are breathtakingly gorgeous. Pretty enough to keep me watching an anime I would have otherwise dropped. If you're just looking for a feast for your eyes, go for it. If you're looking for a great story, it's just not here.",

            "content": "On occasion, I am saddened by the fact that I was right about something.\r\nWhen I see P.A Works, there remains still a linger of excitement. Even though they are the same ones who brought to life Charlotte, the same ones responsible for Another, the ones who bored me to tears with Sakura Quest, and the same ragtag band of hustlers who destroyed the unbelievable hope I held for the miserable Glasslip, every time one glances at the seasonal charts, there is always a resurgent fandom whose intent on making sure everyone knows that P.A Works is coming out with another visual spectacle.\r\nBecause a majority ofthe time, that is all reasonable viewers will come out understanding. They have trite and contrived stories, but they sure are gorgeous to look at. With the benevolent exceptions of Shirobako, Nagi no Asukara, and the Eccentric Family, there is not a single program of theirs that have failed to disappoint. \\n\\n\r\nIn comes in Iroduku: A World in Colors, Hitomi Tsukishiro is a 17-year old high school student whose from a lineage of magic users, but she is monotone and stale. To remedy this, her grandmother sends Hitomi back into the past where a younger version of her grandmother resides to see if there her granddaughter can find herself. There is not a more beautiful and obvious example of a character-driven narrative, which makes one question why concepts like time travel and an ambiguous magic needed to be plot devices in the first place. \\n\\n\r\nLet me repeat: this is a character-driven narrative. If you wanted to incorporate time travel and an ambiguous magic, there would be much better ways to have them be relevant and present in the plot. They are not. Why was it necessary when it all devolves into a melodramatic romance set in a derivative high school setting? \\n\\n\r\nHere, I will need to define two words from the perspective of how I assess anime. \\n\\n\r\nFirst, what makes something melodramatic? Often enough, as a viewer, a program attempts to insert emotions and tones compelling enough to bring out a reaction. A show may attempt to be incredibly violent and filled with gore in an attempt to shock a viewer, making it edgy as well as melodramatic. In this example, the correct manner to address this would be to have the violent actions contain shreds of nuance. Was it earned? Was it senseless violence for the purpose of enriching the setting or the themes? Did it do so successfully or did it fail to go anywhere meaningful? Goblin Slayer would be one I reference to say it failed. The original season of Psycho Pass where it was successful. In Iroduku, the relationships are artificial and devoid of any endearing characterization to the point where we as viewers cannot buy it. While we often find adorable the idea of what they present to us, it is because we have filled in the cracks with our own experience and knowledge. P.A Works did not create a narrative that earned any of its developments. Characters are coupled up for the sake of the main romance. From the outset, Hitomi is supposed to go back in time to find herself as an individual and of course the only way she can do that is through a guy. There are two crimes: one, Hitomi needs a guy to discover herself; second, it is not a believable relationship so how could she have possibly found herself through this guy with the most shallow and unbelievable of interactions. P.A Works expects its viewers to find the content of its narrative as beautiful as its visuals, but that is the equivalent of a red herring. Visuals are meant to complement its narrative, create a synaesthesia between the story, visuals, and audio. There\u2019s a variable here clearly nonexistent in strength. \\n\\n\r\nSecond, what exactly does it mean to be derivative? Obviously, nothing is entirely original and the pursuit of an experience that is entirely original is neither realistic nor is it the ideal. Little Busters: Refrain! is clearly derivative of many visual novel adaptations, yet it is such a pinnacle in that space that it is highly enjoyable nonetheless. We strive to consume content that refines its sources more and more. Makoto Shinkai films are basically the same film over and over - I would know, as I have been consuming for them since The Place Promised in Our Early Days, and after a while, I was sticking around for the pretty visuals wondering when Shinkai would feel successful enough that he would leave the theme of forlorn and unrequited love alone. Nonetheless, he kept retreading the same ground (to a contentious degree) while spinning the premise until he hit the biggest success of his entire career in Your Name. Here he has captured the essence of the story he has been trying to tell for the better part of more than a decade. I was left completely impressed and shocked. It is the greatest experience I had in 2016. Derivative is not the principal issue a majority of the time. It is the repetition of tired ground without an ounce of innovation or personality. There is nothing that sets apart this anime from its contemporaries. There are plenty of personal growth narratives in high school settings that supersede this in every category. Golden Time does an infinitely better job doing this and it has bloody amnesia tropes ridden all about it. But it has a more humorous ensemble and character dynamics, while this one is latent and directionless hue of drab. \\n\\n\r\nVisuals look pretty. Too bad it is left to waste in something that will be forgotten by Winter 2019. To be honest, it was forgotten after the airing of the last episode. \\n\\n\r\nIn all fairness, the one merit of the show is that it is consistent. Sure, consistently boring and uninspired, but it does the bare essentials. It has the plot, it has the characters, it continues on its trajectory, has an ending, and ties its subplots together and sends you along. Much can be said on how unfortunately rare a show successfully does this, when it comes to this genre in particular. \\n\\n\r\nP.A Works is a brutal and lustful behemoth. They cannot stop making you think this may be their next hit; the debuts are strong enough and brimming with potential. Then it starts to become obvious the narrative is not going anywhere. Why did I start watching this again? There\u2019s nothing worthwhile here. It\u2019s an artificial canvas of wonderful artwork, but the layers underneath when uncovered reveal a regrettably vapid mosaic that was better left backstage than on full display. \\n\\n\r\n[This review was copied from a blog titled \"Fictional Freak\", a new website where a band of college writers develop their writing by commenting on all the anime, gaming, and later literature that fascinates them or is being circulated.

            "content": "P.A. Works, a studio that is synonymous with shows that have Slice of Life and Drama mixed together. True Tears, Angel Beats, Charlotte, Shirobako, and many more are a few examples. Irozuku Sekai no Ashita kara, was a show that I was excited for, and it ended in a way that I can only consider as fulfilling but tragic at the same time. \r\nStory: 5 - To be honest, it was just a slice-of-life show. Drama was mixed in the episodes, not directly, but just subtle enough for the average viewer to sense jealousy. There was a foundation to the story, which was to buildthe characters and the world. More so the characters, but it was decently executed, which is why I have it a mediocre score.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9 - THIS, is the one of the best aspects of the show, WOW, P.A. Works never dissapoints in the animation department for sure. The fireworks, vibrancy in the world, and character designs are top notch. I would consider this one of the best animated shows of this year. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10 - AMAZING OPENING, It's really opening\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6 - This is part of the show where I have to nitpick. The characters were developed fairly well for 13 episodes. The introduction to them was comedic in a sense, and the groups dynamic was done in a way where you weren't truly bored waiting for anything to happen. The main heroine though, she was what I would call a Violet Evergarden copy. What do I mean by this, the show is about a girl finding her purpose in life. Our main heroine can't see color, which makes her lack any motivation in her current life, so she was sent to the past, to find her purpose. If any of you have watched Violet Evergarden, it's quite obvious where I'm going with this. Violet however, it's executed in short but intertwined stories that help develop Violet. So what I'm trying to say is, the main heroine at the end. It was a hopeful ending, I know we didn't want it. But with the time travel aspect added into the show, it was to be expected.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7 - I had an okay experience with this show. I was drawn in from the beautiful animation, and because of this. I watched this entire show, which didn't dissapoint me at all. For fans who enjoy Violet Evergarden, this is certainly a must watch.\\n",

            "content": "Okay so this is the first time I make a review ever. And english isn't my first language so bear with me. But I wanted to express my disappointment with this anime somehow. And yeah I haven't finished it, in fact it's still ongoing, but I just can't bring myself to finish it.\r\nThe main reason I started watching this anime is because I read that it was directed by Nagi no Asukara's director. I absolutely loved that anime, it was very enjoyable and full of emotions. So I thought this anime would be just as good. The result? Not at all.\r\nIt starts with a potentiallyinteresting plot (no spoilers) so it kinda makes you curious about how it is going to end. But the thing is, after 9 episodes I watched, nothing related to the plot has happened. I'm surprised it is not considered a slice of life anime, because I asure you IT IS. Now I normally like slice of life IF they are somewhat enjoyable. This one just isn't, it's very veeeery boring. This is where my huge disappointment comes.\\n\\n\r\nNow it has some good things like the animation, aesthetic and music. But of course that is just not enough to make a good anime. I feel like the creators thought this anime would be super popular just by being pretty or something.\\n\\n\r\nI'm going to set my rankings. Story: 3/10. Extremely poor given the potential it originally had. \\n\r\nArt: 8/10. Quite beautiful and colorful.\\n\r\nSound 9/10. I looove the music, it's magical. Not to mention Nagi Yanagi sings the ending so that's a plus.\\n\r\nCharacters: 3/10. Do they even have personalities? No they don't. Only the Kohaku has one. Literally. Also the romances aren't well done at all. The main couple have 0 chemistry and are overall super boring to see...\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4/10. No words needed, it's just not enjoyable.\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10. I honestly think it does not deserve any better, regardless of the end of the anime.",

Main MC is just too, depressed and the male mc is just too 'insensitive' making it bad combination, in today's season. (well still depending on other consumers ofc). Side characters are fine, no need to be troubled about.\r\nThis anime is somewhat deserving but still needs a hell a good of polishing its MC's, like char development. The flow of story is somewhat very slow but I think you can get a hang of it. \r\nIt's a good anime forthose people who has a thing for this kind of anime. I do not find it THAT bad though. IMO removing the 'romance' will make the story good, and giving it a good chara development on the paring mc couple, but I personally think it's gonna be quite hard since 13 episodes won't just make it decent.\\n\\n\r\nSo \\n\r\nStory 4/10 (NEEDS MORE SPICE)\\n\r\nArt 8/10 (HELLA GOOD ART)\\n\r\nCharacters 4/10 (NEEDS GROWTH)",

It's not very important to know why things are the way they are in terms of the atmosphere.  If you can move through that without casting doubt on how everything works, you'll get to enjoy the series.  For me it was a nice fresh take on slice of life, school, romance, and moving on.\r\nArt> 10\r\nFor me the art is big in any series getting a high rating.  I come not only for the story but the visual that let's me get attached to what's happening.  This show does a great job withvisuals.  The art alone will bring me back to watch it again.  Contrasting monochromatic and full views of vibrant colors really makes the series pop.\\n\\n\r\nSound> 7\\n\r\nI was not swept away by the soundtrack but the it didn't take anything away for me either.  To me, that means it blended in so well with the production of it all that it didn't overwhelm the story.  I can appreciate that.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters>8\\n\r\nCharacter development feels natural without leaving too much behind.  Characters move through confrontations to progress their situations alongside the typical sit back and do nothing that is common in a lot of romance anime.  The series does a good job not building up overwhelming tension over every little thing and provides levels of closure.  Not to say there is no tension at all, but paired with the their ability to balance it keeps it all together.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment>9\\n\r\nThis series was very enjoyable to me.  It's a series that had me watching it straight through.  I wasn't pushed into power watching it due to unnecessary cliffhangers or thrills, but rather because I wanted it to keep going.  The store and development are well done and they avoid diving heavy into time fillers.  Scenes do not feel meaningless in the overall development.  The pace was smooth and kept the entire thing enjoyable for me all the way to the end.\\n\\n\r\nOverall> 9\\n\r\nIf you're a fan of the genre \"Slice of Life\" or \"Romance\" I think this is a series that you should really take the time to watch.  This would be especially true if you can enjoy the beautiful art that comes along with the series.  Current it's rated 7.65 at the time of this review and a lot of that seems to be due to plot hangups.  As I covered pretty early on, don't get left behind by the setup/plot.  Just let it be as that allows the rest of the story to really flow and come together.  You just need to enjoy it for what it is.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Slight spoiler review\r\nIrozuku is kind of slice of life-drama, with some romance? With an expected ending if you watch anime regularly, and few touching moments.\r\nThe main line is the personal growth but....the idea is good, the thing about Hitomi and her monochromatic vision mixed with time travel is original but the way they made it is unsatisfying and the reasons are...CHARACTERS AND PLOT.\r\nThere is no development of any character except  Hitomi and the main guy  and is very poor, I mean she changes but I can't believe it, just a few moments during a couple of weeks maybe a month I can't remember;and a romance (poorly develop romance based on the art of the guy)and I have to believe that it is enough to change the personality of a person after 16 years.\\n\r\nAnd the second problem but the most important of the show;  the rest of the cast give zero to you, a few minutes of each one. The shy girls remain as the shy girl, without confronting her feelings. The megane girl only has 5 minutes during the show. The president is null only introduce in order to try some kind of love triangle.\\n\r\nKohaku is the only one that has some strength on her personality and the only one i really care about between the secondary cast.\\n\r\nChigusa is only used to make some jokes and a couple of deep sentences.\\n\r\nAnd the main guy who is the only who at the end has changed but as it happens with Hitomi you have to accept because the romance that i have to say it again is a very poorly developed romance.\\n\\n\r\nThe Plot\\n\r\nThe idea is quite interesting, but I have the feeling that the show doesn't exploit all the ideas, they drop the slice of life moments, the drama, the HItomi problem and the romance but neither of them has true power except for the last 3 episodes where the romance and the drama I have to admit that have a very touching moments (moments not the entire episode), but few moments at the last 3 episodes for a 13 episodes show its pretty vague. The ending of the show is the expected, logical and giving the conclusion they want during all the show.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, is a nice show with a nice premise but remains all the series with the same problem not enough development of any of her ideas or characters.",

            "content": "What can I say? I certainly had higher hopes for this anime, and while there is certainly a lot I liked which made it enough to separate it from Slice of Life predecessors, there was also a lot it could have done better.\r\nWhat I liked - \r\nThe Art, need I say more about this? Very few anime are able to capture it's art direction so close to it's story. It's not just gorgeous, it also ties directly with the anime's core themes, and every minute of it is undeniably beautiful. \r\nI liked the relationship between the grandmother and the protagonist, while at first it wasall sudden and just disconnected, it became clear that the story was as much about connecting with her family as it was finding friends and learning to love life. Out of all the characters, Kohaku had surprisingly the most development, and because of her I really liked the ending.\\n\\n\r\nThe themes are strong and relevant. Incorporating depression and emotions with visuals was as smart as it was bittersweet. This was done better in A Silent Voice, but it was interesting here never the less.\\n\\n\r\nWhat it could have done better - \\n\\n\r\nAs good as the art is, I really wish that they played on this aspect more. Outside of seeing the contrast with the protagonist's monochromatic view and everyone else's, it really doesn't do much else even though it's core to the story.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Kohaku was interesting, there really isn't much to define our protagonist, and even less so for it's secondary characters even though they are supposed to be the people who help Hitomi love life again. They were more bland than Violet Evergarden combined, no backstory, no personality outside the clich\u00e9, and they turned out exactly how you think they would. Also, the love triangles are so melodramatically boring.\\n\\n\r\nThe themes are strong and relevant, but rarely explored. The theme here is the story, but throughout the 13 episodes there is very little happening, even the protagonist has no idea whats going on or what she is supposed to do up until the end. It's themes are simply drowned by the excessive amount of irrelevant filler that make up this anime and it's a dire shame since it really had potential.",

            "content": "Ended up giving a 6 for this show, could've been a 7 with some major changes to the plot. Then again I don't really like pure romance/drama series so I could be somewhat biased against this but I really don't feel like this deserves a 7.\r\nThis is a time- travelling series about a girl who has lost her ability to see colors for reasons I cannot mention without spoilers. Her grandmother sends her back in time in hopes that she could experience a more fun youth, instead of moping around being super pessimistic(this is her the entire series). You'd think that time- travel sounds likea super risky gamble where a billion things could go wrong but none of the characters seem worried so neither was I. \\n\\n\r\n+ Great visual values. The characters look kind of generic but the buildings and landscapes look simply gorgeous. I personally liked it a lot.\\n\r\n+ Great music. I really liked both the OP and ED and listened to them on my own a couple of times. There is also some awesome BGM during some of the animation \"wow\"- moments. Overall adds a good bit of spice.\\n\r\n+ Some great movie like \"magical moments\" I had to go back and rewatch.\\n\\n\r\n+/- Voice actors seem like good picks though the female voices' high pitch tends to tire my ears out as usual. MC's voice is very bland.\\n\\n\r\n- The plot... there isn't really a lot of it? I can't really talk about it without risking to spoil the little there is but, no, this \"story\" is just about nostalgia and memories, nothing really happens here.\\n\r\n- The characters are, like I said, the fairly generic, ultra-positive Japanese High School students. 13 episodes being short enough as it is, it's hard to get emotionally attached to these talking dolls. \\n\r\n- The magic element seems like it was just slapped on the top of this show, don't expect any Harry Potter- level of depth from this magical world. People don't seem to use magic for really anything else but some light entertainment.\\n\\n",

            "content": "As most of the high ranking reviews made this series out to be either mediocre or just decent, I think I need to do it some justice, for anyone cares enough to go down the list. And so, there will be some minor spoiler, but as those are going to be key points for me, I think you need to be warned.\r\nFirst thing first, for story line, Irozuku Sekai no Ashita Kara (I'll be calling it with just Irozuku, instead of any official abbreviation it might have) is not all that good. You basically have 5 threads that went down the series, that's pretty impressivefor a series lasting only 13 episodes, I think. But, if you really look at it, it's not really anything new. First thread, time travel and the inevitable outcome of it. Second thread, magic and what comes with talent in magic (or anything for that matter). Third thread, character's disability (might sound overboard, but that's the best word came to my mind). Fourth, worries about what to do in future for young ones. Fifth, romance.\\n\\n\r\nIt's nothing new really, you might even compare them to many other series, such as Nagi no Asukara, as I saw someone people noted. But, the way those threads were woven into each other was actually great to me, at least. \\n\\n\r\nFemale lead/main character/protagonist is basically, disabled as in she's unable to see color, and you can see why right away, she's shutting herself out and always seems gloomy. One day, she just got sent off to the past for almost no reason but to satisfy another character's wish. Really, it was arbitrarily done. The reasons didn't get to be revealed until last episode too. But heck, there are other ways to perform therapies. Yes, the reasons has \"recovery of ability to see color\" for the protagonist included. But sending her back to the past using magic and force your past self to research the magic isn't quite the best way to do it, really. And it wasn't even revealed by words as protagonist realizes it too. That really kills off any adventure's purpose set for character development. But then, it springs several more threads into existence to keep the series going.\\n\\n\r\nRomance, the one thing you can't seem to get away in works with a female lead. Protagonist being a time traveler, a magic user (or mage), a disabled, and a meek, beautiful girl is like a flag for romance from the get go. And of course, you see 2 guys in that kind of relationship with her, as in 2 guys have feelings for her and actually competed for it, kind of. A simple shoujo romance went down, with happy ending to the relationships. Yay, good thing, right? It's not explicitly shown, but you can really see how it plays out for the characters, which is nice. Just nice. But then, the dilemma is that the convergence of time flow will not allow alteration. Stein;Gates viewers might have seen enough of that, really. So, friendship, romance and all that junk will have to go to the dustbin for 60 years. Suck to be them. However, that's the beauty of it. Like in 5cm/s, it's beautiful, but unrequited. Yet, they still reach out to each others, still cure each others' illness/disabilities.\\n\\n\r\nYes, disabilities. I did say they have disabilities. Not all of them, but they do. Yamabuki Shou was a blockhead while being sensual and it hurts him, it's a minor disability and you can live with it. Kazano Asagi, she's meek and inactive. It hurts her too, in lots of way. Kawai Kurumi, she's nothing special while everyone else is. It doesn't hurt her, but it brings her down. Aoi Yuito, talented, but isn't motivated and actually feel repressive on his favorites. Tsukishiro Hitomi, talented but it leads to a trauma for her and directly caused her to become actually disabled. These are what happen to youngsters. Basically, this is where the messages are. And also, the basic solution is \"to find the right person to help you\". Nothing I didn't see before.\\n\\n\r\nBut, it's refreshing how the problems arise and resolve so naturally. 2 guys competing over 1 girl, 1 confesses and shot down, the other takes sometime  to know he's winner and confess. Worries about future eased up by people who cares about you telling it's fine to take it easy to think. Friends who are rivals in love go back to good friends for knowing how it goes with each other. Love and encouragement last through time so the two can bring happiness to each other. How happiness is more than just happiness. It's actually very philosophical how problems are solved. I still don't sit well with how a mutual love became unrequited romance, but it's beautiful too so I guess it's fine. \\n\\n\r\nWriting up to this point, I kind of lost track of what I wanted to say, but to sum it up, Irozuku was an enjoyable series to me with how well stuff are related, how it's not hard to see myself in there, how realistic its depiction of relationships is, how \"beautiful\" every emotion, feeling, piece of memories can be... It's not bad, it's not good either, but it's somehow strangely soothing once you went through it. Personally, I wouldn't really recommend Irozuku to any young viewers though. Because it's more of something older people can understand. But, it should be a good series to younger viewers (around highschool, college), though they might not like it the first time around unless they can relate themselves hard with it.",

The plot itself is engaging right from the start, and in my case it pulled me from a sort of initial derision to instant engagement when they introduced time travel, which I usually find a difficult subject for anime writers.  The feeling of full immersion never left me the entire time, and I adore the way they represented their magic in the everyday world.  Honestly, lesser artwork would have outright killed this show, because the less sensical parts of theworld seem less prominent when you're being bombarded by pretty colors.\\n\\n\r\nThat said I didn't give the show a 10, for the following reasons.  The plotline has a solid baseline of awesomeness but doesn't do much to capitalize on that except display typical high school shenanigans.  The author has a lot of room to work with within the constructed world they've made and really doesn't use it.  Also, while the show rides on some pretty deep characters, some of the characters are lacking in depth by comparison, and a lot of the interaction seems very stiff.  But all in all it's still above average in all qualities, with absolutely stunning art and sound.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this anime for anyone who likes really pretty stuff, or who likes Slice of Life anime with supernatural twists.  It gave me a really similar feel to Violet Evergarden.",

The magic is often something that is just present, but not really the primary focus of the show. Besides the magic the setting is basically modern day Japan and the show doesn\u2019t really do anything crazy with it. \r\nThe plot of the show is a sweet tale about an emotionless girl wholost the ability to see colours and learns how to open up to people. Right from the start the story shows some promise, but it never really lives up to its potential. However that doesn\u2019t mean the story is bad. In fact the story is quite good, but it drags out a bit in the middle. The finale is the emotional highlight of the show and it definitely feels earned. The dialogue in the show is top notch and feels very natural.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nThe show looks absolutely gorgeous, and makes great use of lighting. The backgrounds look awesome. The colour palette is very natural, but the show also likes to play with colours as the main character is colourblind. Character design is great as well, all the characters look very natural, the only exceptions being the hair colours of the magic characters. The animation is fairly fluid, but not all that special in comparison with the art.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\r\nThe sound design is very solid, but not necessarily anything special. The magic sounds nice and the other effects sound fairly natural. The music enhances the scenes in which it is played. The voice acting is good and especially the main character does a great job conveying the growth of the character with voice acting.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10\\n\r\nThe characters in the show all have their own personalities and each and every one of them feels like a real person. Most of them also show some clear growth over the course of the show. The group of characters together also feel like I could go outside and meet people like them. There aren\u2019t that many side characters, but the ones that do pop up aren\u2019t anything special.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10\\n\r\nThe show is a great watch with satisfying progression from start to finish. Not only is the show satisfying to watch it is also amazing eye candy. There were a few parts where I got a bit annoyed at the series, but never enough to take away from my enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10\\n",

Even though the story itself feels short-lived and not very developed, the art and animation remains beautiful without a doubt. In almost every aspect in terms of animation, it has went above and beyond. But for actual plot and story, it was very short and definitely would have done better if more episodes were added. Worth a watch for the art and animation, but not much else.\r\nThe characters were all laid out and had good story behind them all, but it felt as if notenough time were spent on each persons story to have the viewers (us) really care much about them. We will know their backstory, but not really \"connect\" with the character themselves.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is basically an excuse to make amazing and awesome art and animation. The best I've seen in a long time. Focuses primarily and how you can view the world differently and how beautiful things come from everyday life and so on and so forth.",

            "content": "This anime is quite relaxing and inspiring. The story develops at its own pace, not rushing things and not making long pauses. You won't find here any evil plots or mind boggling time travel mechanics. Everything in the story is rather simple, and sometimes even reduced to quite basic elements. Like characters, for example. \r\nStory-wise, everything is written in pastel tones with small areas of bright color to add accents. I think, it suits the mood of the anime well, and provides audience with a clear view at what is important in the anime.\r\nThe important things are in line with the genre: friendship and love,pursuit of the goals, growing up. But these important things are shown in somewhat unusual way, with some magic involved in everyday life (but not too much), so it makes all the world of difference.\\n\\n\r\nThe romance part of the anime will stir some feelings inside of you, but not in a way, that you feel like a wretch the whole day afterwards. I would say, that this part is quite gentle, like the anime itself. More like something to think about, but not to dwell too much. \\n\\n\r\nIf you would like a monochrome slice of life with a bit of magic in it, don't look any further, it gently landed in your hands like a feather, and will probably be swept away from your mind like a feather too.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",
