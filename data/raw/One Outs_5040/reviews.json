            "content": "\u201cNobody wins, but I!\u201d, the subtitle of the series, couldn\u2019t be more accurate. \r\nOne Outs is the story of the extremist gambler Toua Tokuchi, his battle to completely crush his opponents in the Japanese Pacific Baseball League and, perhaps less importantly to the pitcher, earn a beefy salary while doing so. While advantageous, and likely to increase one's enjoyment of the series, a deep knowledge of the sport of Baseball is not required. Make no mistake; the series is first and foremost about the character, rather than the vehicle used to display his feats.\r\nThe story begins in the island of Okinawa, with the star playerof the Lycaons, Kojima Hiromichi, training for the upcoming season in the hopes of leading the dismal team to the championships. It is here the title game is revealed to be a betting competition between batter and pitcher, with both sides attempting to overwhelm and suppress the other respectively. Tokuchi is revealed to be the undisputed king of the game, and through multiple matches with Lycaons members and Kojima himself, Tokuchi loses his first contest yet and agrees to join the Lycaons at the behest of Kojima, who believes he can lead the team to victory.\\n\\n\r\nIt is here that the primary antagonist is revealed, and the driving gamble of the series is set. The Lycaons team owner, Saikawa, is only concerned with money and the return he can get on stadium seating compared to his losses from expenses such as the players salary. As an all-too-intriguing prospect to Tokuchi and Saikawa, the One Outs contract is formed, granting Tokuchi 5,000,000 yen for every out he acquires as pitcher, but a deduction of 50,000,000 yen for every run he gives up.  Thus the stage is set for a battle between the two, whilst Tokuchi also has to deal with the other teams in the league and the various methods he must dispel to win the game with a profit. A fun and smart little addition to the series is the revealed sum of Tokuchi\u2019s current salary, usually given after every few games, to give the viewer an idea of just how much the strategist is escaping with.\\n\\n\r\nToua Tokuchi (And his very black & white view of winning & losing) is very much the star here, with even the over-lording antagonist being delegated to a role of being completely outwitted and shocked at each loss. In this sense, the series is very much like another oft-compared Madhouse anime, Akagi (In fact, both characters share the same voice actor, Masato Hagiwara). The spotlight is always on the overly-confident, cold-blooded genius, and you seldom if ever really feel like he\u2019s going to lose, no matter what the predicament. If this isn\u2019t your type of thing, One Outs might not be right for you, and another Madhouse gambling series, Kaiji, is likely more up your alley. Secondary characters such as Kojima and the catcher, Satoshi Ideguchi, essentially act as reasons for Tokuchi to explain his plans, though they occasional prove useful on their own, and the owner is always most concerned with ways to recoup his losses on the games with Tokuchi.\\n\\n\r\nThe rival teams all have various methods for victory, from star players to expert strategy to outright cheating, and watching these plans be revealed, falter, and be destroyed in kind by Tokuchi\u2019s insight never gets tiring. The extents of the wild gambler\u2019s methods are seen to truly reach their peak during the team\u2019s third match with most powerful squad in the league, the Mariners. As if controlling puppets on a string, he turns the game into a farce just barely within the rules, with both teams striving for errors and various other foul plays in a race against time. Another example has him practicing the principles of \u201can eye for an eye\u201d, responding to an intentional pitch thrown to injure him with throwing the bat at the pitcher during his swing. As all the teams have multi-layered paths to their own victory, the three-game series\u2019 are never over too quickly, as both sides continually adjust in an attempt to corner the other. Many of the \u201ctricks\u201d aren\u2019t easy to discern by oneself, and will paste a smile on your face or have you laughing manically upon the eventual reveal and Tokuchi subsequently using it against the opponents.\\n\\n\r\nThe series artwork is fairly realistic, with exception of characters like the Manager and Assistant Manager who are drawn in the fashion of comic relief. The series makes use of a few foreign (Essentially American) players as well, and draw then is somewhat stereotypical fashion, but still utilizing good designs. It seems Madhouse also wanted to appeal to female otaku in the series as well, with the OP housing continual shots of Tokuchi shirtless and looking aloof.\\n\\n\r\nThe audio work in One Outs is fitting, but the musical side never really rises above. It all fits great in the series and never feels out of place, but it\u2019s also not really a soundtrack you would listen to outside of the anime. The voice acting is done really well, with Tokuchi\u2019s voice actor, Masato Hagiwara, easily stealing the show thanks to his familiarity in the role (And gambling anime in general) thanks to his previous work as the title characters in Akagi and Kaiji. The Lycaons manager also performs admirably in his efforts at comic relief, making it a bit hard not to chuckle every time he calls for a \u201csafety bunt-o\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nThe series provides everything a viewer could want in a series based on mental and/or gambling, and the use of baseball allows all 25 episodes to remain fresh thanks to the numerous ways the rules can be warped and the loopholes that can be exploited. Anyone looking for series revolving around plans, schemes, and overall mental talent will certainly not be disappointed.",

            "content": "So, One Outs is an anime about sports, right? Hell no! Its about Tokuchi owning everyone and kicking their asses! Its very similar to Akagi, so if you enjoyed that the chances are VERY slim that you wont enjoy this one as well!\r\nStory\r\nWell, the story itself isnt really anything special, Its about Tokuchi Toua who is a genius pitcher. He kinda gets forced to join the lowly ranked Lycaons baseball team. Of course his goal is to make their team start winning their matches. So the basic story is pretty ordinary as you can see, but there are two things that makes the whole thinga lot more interesting. The first is how the matches are played. The Lycaons opponents always have better players overall, or some kind of ace up their sleeve and one team is even cheating. Now its Tokuchis job to destroy these opponents using his brilliant mind. Thats right, One Outs is actually more about strategies and mind games than actuall baseball. \\n\\n\r\nThe second twist is that Tokuchi gets 5 000 000 yen for every out he pitches, but loses 50 000 000 yen for every point he gives up. And the Lycaons manager cares more about making money out of Tokuchi than winning the actuall games, so he tries to make his own team lose! So outsmarting the other teams is not enough for Tokuchi, he has to fight on two fronts also preventing the manager from ruining the games with his interference. This puts Tokuchi in all kinds of impossible situations, but he always succeeds in coming up with a counter-strategy, and watching this is a blast! The best part is that all of Tokuchis strategies makes perfect sense after they are explained! You never feel like the creators are cheating and leaving out unexplained or logically invalid bits and pieces.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nNot a particularly interesting point. Its good, it does the job, it doesnt bother you. \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nNot that this matters or affects the score in anyway, but Ill still say it: The OP was pretty good, I actually watched it which I often dont. But of course the important stuff is the bgm and the voices. And well, I have no complaints, they were both very good. The music fit in great with the intense and exciting atmosphere. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nOk, Tokuchi himself is awesome. He is one of the most badass characters ever. Nothing ever fazes him. Even if the situation is looking extremely bad he still remains cold and calculating, soon to be delivering his new plan that will eliminate all his obstacles. The thing is that the other characters are not even half as interesting. They are either tools for him to use, or obstacles for him to completely destroy, using these tools. And thats pretty much it. Of course it doesnt really matter seeing how the point of the show is watching when Tokuchi kicks ass. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nThis show never really gets boring. You know Tokuchi is always going to win, but it doesnt matter, because seeing him in action is just too freakin awesome. Also, finding out HOW he will to get out of all the imossible situations and what kind of strategies he comes up with, is another important part. The only complaint here is that it is a bit slow sometimes, but you get so caught up in it that it doesnt really matter at all. \\n\\n\r\nSo, One Outs is a show about mind games and tricks more than baseball, and if you like that kind of stuff you must try this one. And yeah, if you like badass characters owning everyone then thats another reason to watch this. Even if you dont give it a try, because its awesome!",

            "content": "\"Winner takes all. This is the universal rule of battle.\" - Toua Tokuchi. \r\nOne Outs, for the most part, only caught my attention after I was looking for similar titles to the recent sports anime, Diamond no Ace. After taking a look at the synopsis I considered it and put it in plan-to-watch only to start and end it months later but in a rather very quick time. \r\nThe story sets off in the island of Okinawa, where the pinch-hitter of the struggling and fictional Lycaons team, Kojima Hiromichi, heads off to form a training camp in hopes of reclaiming the ultimate prize that isthe Japanese Baseball Championship. When a minor league pitcher who trains with Kojima gets injured, him and Kojima's trainer are forced to look for a replacement, but this is when they run into a group of people who seem to play a shady game of gambling related to Baseball, named \"One Outs\". It's apparently a one-on-one between the batter and the pitcher but with money on the line. After completely losing out to a mysterious pitcher named Toua Tokuchi, Kojima arrives at the scene next day to avenge his teammates and find this mysterious pitcher and defeat him. Things don't go as planned for him though as even he is completely beaten by Tokuchi and is forced to conceal himself from the people for a week. After some days, though, Kojima finally returns and seeks a rematch with Tokuchi Toua once again. This time though, he urges Tokuchi that he'd retire from professional Baseball at once if he loses, but then tells Tokuchi that if he wins he'd take an arm off Tokuchi in order to make sure he never gambles on Baseball again. Tokuchi promptly agrees to the deal and faces off with Kojima once again. Circumstances make Tokuchi lose his first ever \"One Outs\" game and readily offers his arms to Kojima, but he tells that he never said he'd \"break\" his arm but simply \"take it\" as he grasps Tokuchi's right arm. Kojima urges Tokuchi, who has exceptional potential in Baseball, to join his team Lycaons and help them to win the Championship. Thus beginning his first step towards professional Baseball. Not long after he meets the Owner of the Lycaons, who refuses to give up any significant amount of salary to Tokuchi for his yet unknown abilities, Tokuchi then proposes an unusual ordeal, he tells that for every out he pitches, he'd get 5,000,000 yen but loses 50,000,000 yen for every run he gives up.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the artwork of the series as we move on, I have come across a few criticism's that it's pretty poor and not aesthetically pleasing. I, however, believe it's the opposite of that where the art actually stands out on top. I'm not an avid reader of Manga's and haven't read the One Outs manga either, but I can say that the art is top-notch throughout the series. It was indeed the striking poster of Tokuchi Toua that got me interested in it, and it isn't any different in the anime either, full marks for that. And I'm not comparing the two by any means but if you see the artwork of Death Note, a similar and much popular psychologically-hit anime and One Outs, you could say that it's Death Note that lacked a bit in art. This is just my opinion though, anyway. \\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the Opening and Ending themes of One Outs as well as the soundtrack, which are pretty okay in comparison to the whole anime. They both practically just do the standard work of an opening and an ending theme, that's pretty much how I'd put it. The ending theme however was pretty good and made me search for the full version on Youtube and it was pretty nice. \\n\\n\r\nThe show is fully centered around our mastermind Tokuchi Toua, and the Owner being the antagonist. In terms of enjoyment, One Outs never disappoints and it kept me in the edge of my seat throughout the entire series. Game after game you are left astounded by the various shrewd and astute tactics by Tokuchi Toua. \\n\\n\r\nIt was only long after since I actually came across this anime for the first time that I started watching. And I managed to finish it off in a week but was left astounded as to what a great gem of a show this is. Compared to its various psychological thriller hits, its highly underrated and mostly overlooked just because it's based on the concept of Baseball and not many people are aware of the game. That being said I can guarantee you that you don't need to have a deep knowledge of the sport. \\n\\n\r\nDiamond no Ace is the only other Baseball anime that I've watched so far and before that and I should say that STILL I have not a very complex idea on how Baseball works. Though I have learnt a fair amount of things. If you seek a mind-bending anime with a sharp-witted and easily likeable character with godly skills, One Outs is definitely worth checking out. If it turns out the way as it did for me, you'll love it for sure.\\n",

            "content": "Pen is mightier than sword, that is what we learn from one outs. From the synopsis one may be confused that Is this baseball? Is this chess? Is this gambling? The answer is Nope its not, its ONE OUTS. Bored of animes with cliche MC, who either suck at everything and gradually develops into a strong character or suddenly gets a powerboost to defeat all his foes, or in the name of friends brings out some kind of hidden power, and stuff, then u r definitely looking for this awesomesauce.\r\nBaseball as a sports isn't popular in my country, as such I dont even know allthe rules of the game. The ongoing anime Diamond no Ace which is also a baseball anime inspired me and got me into the game, and as such I was expecting One Outs to be a similar sports genre anime. But I was gravely mistaken, and had to eat my words, because it was much more than that.\\n\\n\r\nThe best picture of one outs is this-What would happen if someone with IQ 200+ starts pitching in a baseball game? The answer is you get one outs. \"Cool\" \"Awesome\" \"Incredible\" \"Mindblowing\" these mere words are just not enough. \"One outs\" the title of the anime cant exactly bring out its epicness, rather the subtitle fairly does \"nobody wins but I\". The main reason\u00a0 for all this is the additional psychological genre which grills our mind.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and sound 8/10\\n\r\nConsidering this to be a 2009 anime, the animation is pretty decent, but obviously not at the level of present animes. But it is not something which will burn up ur eyes, so this shouldn't be a barrier for watching the anime. As for osts and opening, these were cool, and conveyed the atmosphere in the most appreciable way which fits the genre.\\n\\n\r\nStory 9/10 :\\n\r\nFor the story, it is the most difficult part to explain without spoiling a bit. Almost the whole story revolves around the protagonist tokuchi, and the antagonist the Owner. The biggest defect of the story is that the introduction part was a bit long, other than that it follows a steady pace. So there is a miser owner, who gets into a contract with tokuchi, if tokuchi gets someone out, he gets 5 million yen, but if he gives up a run, he pays 50 million yen. The story is plain and simple he plays against his opponents, thats all. The story is kept interesting by showing us his tentative salary periodically, after each game. That said how the matches take place is quite amusing, and most often viewer will be tempted to say something like brilliant, and may have no words left for what comes next. As such the story mostly develops around the single protagonist tokuchi and how he distinguishes himself with his keen observational skills and high intellect. It conveys that skill is not the only important thing in a game such as baseball. Another aspect of the story is that there is always someone smart in the opponent team and rivals tokuchi.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 8/10\\n\r\nThe only character in focus is tokuchi, all others are sidelined and get less screen time. Apart from tokuchi there is the catcher Ideguchi who mostly serves to display the thought process of a common man, and brings out what is going through tokuchi's mind. Also there is the batter Kojima who plays a similar role, but in a rather sophisticated manner. And ofcourse we are also shown what the opponents are thinking. There is always one smart guy on the opposite team who partially sees through tokuchi's acts but what happens..... u need to watch the anime. Moreover there is the owner, his personal assistant, and chief, and the manager who mostly add to the comedy part. Tbh, this anime doesn't have comedy genre, yet I was forced to laugh on many occasions, especially due to the character's caricature done by the narrator. In fact narrator has done a very good job explaining many things.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed the series fully, tokuchi's character itself is brilliant, his tactics, his mind and his cunning behaviour. It was fun to see how his tricks succeeded, and the reactions of his opponents, and also that of the owner. I laughed a lot, on the incompetent manager, as well as on his teammates. I didn't regret a minute spent on it. \\n\r\nIn the end, I couldnt give it a perfect 10, because it lacked two things. First is something, something which I can't recall, it is a silly thing, yet I can't recollect, Ah! I now remember, this lacks a SEQUEL. To get 10 it really needs a sequel. \\n\\n\r\nRead the next para only if u have watched the series else skip the para.\\n\\n\r\nSecond, and the more important fact is this-- For the first 10 eps we are not shown what is going through tokuchi's mind. But after that we are shown what he is thinking giving us many clues and made it uninteresting. No doubt logic is a must in these kinds of anime, but the explanation were a bit too implicative. As a matter of fact I was able to predict 80% of the story from the clues presented. One may call it a positive factor which because the author states facts in a lucid yet tricky fashion, but on the other hand it may be referred to as a bit of cliche, because if u can predict the outcome the anime become less interesting. Other animes of the similar genre like death note were much more successful because unexpected things happened but in this case most of them are fact driven and if someone pays close attention they can decipher the whole anime. I know it is not a mystery genre, but nonetheless it became bit predictable in the latter half. I like it when the unexpected happens, in fact I expect the unexpected, but this became a bit low in the latter half. Not that it was 100% predictable or something, only a bit predictable. Nonetheless this fact can be easily overlooked and above all it is my personal opinion.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\r\nFinally, this has something which most animes lack, that is its knowledge of scientific facts. The anime lucidly explains psycology, physics, maths and some baseball terms. Many episodes come with a piercing quote from tokuchi, and his perception of winning.\\n\\n\r\nSo it doesnt really matter if u r some avid baseball fan, or simone with no prior knowledge of the sport, because it explains every detail. Moreover the suspense is also cool and it has got some of the best cliffhangers. All in one I would recommend this to anyone looking for a cool anime.",

One Outs is essentially a gambling show revolving around baseball. This would seem boring normally but the production team is apparently able to make even rock-paper-scissors exciting, so baseball can't be too bad. Though a generic sports anime on the surface, it shines in its characters and extremely unique approach to creating suspense. Hell, there's an episode where both teams have to LOSE the game in order to WIN it. It'sonly 11 episodes in so far but it's by far my favorite show this season. Go watch it.",

This show has to be the most stinking pile of shit I have ever seen in my favourite genre of anime: sports. And I know what people are going to say. \"Oh but dude, this isn't a typical sports anime! You just don't understand baseball! You just don't understand Tokuchi Toua's intelligence!\" This is false. You would have to be a mentally impaired slug to not understand Tokuchi Toua's intelligence after watching this series. In fact, that's basically the only thing thatyou take away from this series, besides a pretty decent OP and ED.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThere are none. No, wait, that's incorrect. There is one. One character. His name is Tokuchi Toua. He is the only person in the whole show. He is the only person in the entire world with a mind that is capable of functioning. Yes that was me exaggerating. But not really. The only reason any other character exists is to highlight Tokuchi Toua's godlike, incomparable intelligence. So let's give the cast a name. I propose, \"Tokuchi Toua and His Bunch of Braindead Bitches.\" Because everyone is his braindead bitch. Not just the players on the team, but the manager, the owner, the players on the other team, and maybe even his parents for all the fuck I know. This wouldn't be as much of a problem if they at least gave us some backstory, some insight into Tokuchi's past that lets us see what made him this way. Anything that shaped his personality. But NO! God forbid we get a backstory on the only character worth caring about! Let's get backstories on characters that disappear after 3 episodes! Like that cheating manager! Or that shitty catcher! You know, they tell us that he's been playing One Outs his whole life, but they don't explain how he knows so fucking much about baseball. I'm just left to assume, but I won't dwell on that because it's not a very big complaint of mine. Hold up, did I mention that Tokuchi Toua is the perfect human being? That he is perfect in every sense of the word and nothing he does is incorrect? Because that's exactly how it seems. At the very beginning they tell us that, \"despite his slow pitches, he still wins because he plays with other people's minds!\" Which is fine, until you realize that he can, indeed, pitch fast. Fast enough to get the fastest baseball runner in the world out. He was hiding that trick all along. No mind games needed here. No weird tactics. Nothing. So yeah TL;DR, Tokuchi Toua is the everything and everybody else is either his bitch, an evil cunt, or both.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMusic:\\n\\n\r\nUsually one of my favourite parts about an anime but fuck. There's nothing here. I like the OP and ED, but besides that all there is is a bunch of bland, forgettable, funk tracks. And some atmospheric stuff I guess. Shit.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nInteresting premise, I'll give it that. It starts off really strong, and basically has me hooked up until about episode 10-12, where I realize that every game they play is the same shit. The same predictable outcomes. I'll admit it is entertaining to watch the process by which Tokuchi arrives to victory, but if you don't know much about baseball and if you don't like sports/psychological anime, then I don't think you would enjoy this anime past the 8 episode mark.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThemes:\\n\\n\r\nNot even the most basic and easy themes to explore are even hinted at in this anime. The theme of teamwork and unity to achieve a certain goal or purpose, the theme of never giving up regardless of how the odds are against you. These are all themes that are prevalent in sports anime, and I'm not saying all anime should follow genre conventions, but if you're going to choose between following a convention and not doing anything at all, I'd usually say go the conventional route. Teamwork can't be explored because they chose to replace characters with the cast of, \"Tokuchi Toua's tools to triumph.\" In case you haven't noticed, I love alliteration.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR don't watch unless you absolutely adore baseball or psychological anime. And even then don't expect much.",

            "content": "One Outs was a baseball manga written by Kaitani Shinobu. It was adapted into an anime by our old friends at Madhouse, who brought us such classics as Black Lagoon, Petshop of Horrors and Rideback. Unfortunately, they've also been behind some of the worst anime I've ever seen such as Highschool of the Dead and Devil Hunter Yohko. I'm honestly not predicting their best work this time around, although a lot of that is more to do with the subject matter than anything else. I am not a person who cares about sports in the slightest. So, let's look at One Outs and see ifit holds up in spite of my own apathy towards the material. \\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nOur story opens with some minor league players at a training camp. After an injury destroys their pitcher's ability to throw balls at a guy with a stick, two of them go on a search for a new one. At this point they get lured to a gambling arena where people bet on whether or not a guy can hit a ball with a stick. The two lose a large amount of money and their friend, Kojima, who has won a bunch of awards with names that are meaningless to me, returns to challenge the pitcher who beat them, Tokuchi. He loses, but returns for a rematch, if he loses he'll retire, if he wins he'll take Tokuchi's hand so that he can never gamble using baseball again. Because a game that requires people to hit a ball with a stick and run in a square is serious business and not some kind of game. \\n\\n\r\nIn spite of a rather serious hand injury, Kojima wins, but instead of inflicting violence to take Tokuchi's hand, he recruits him as a pitcher to help his team, the Lycaons, win the championship. So, the basic plot is that a low ranking team aims for the championship? I haven't seen that plot since... every piece of sports media ever made, I think. To be fair, One Outs isn't typical in its execution. It uses Tokuchi's unusual contract with the game's owner as the primary source of tension instead of whether or not the team will win the big game. It also puts the focus, not on whether or not the Lycaons will win since basic pattern recognition gives it away, but on how they're going to win. Which is more interesting than it sounds since Tokuchi uses a lot of psychological manipulation and has to think of ways to outsmart his opponents while thwarting the owner's attempts to sabotage him. \\n\\n\r\nThe strategic aspects are pretty well handled in this anime, in spite of the rather trite plot. The series is also good at keeping the viewer's attention with various new elements and twists as well. However, the story telling isn't perfect. The biggest problem is the narrator. His entire job seems to be to give exposition. Which isn't so bad when it's used as a tool to skip through the boring bits, but it's also pretty unnecessary. You could cut out the dialogue for almost all of these scenes and lose nothing. There's also the issue of the plot itself. Even if the execution is unique, just about everyone knows exactly where it's going to go which does limit how much tension the series can have. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of One Outs are mixed. Tokuchi is a pretty interesting \u201cmagnificent bastard\u201d type of character. The Lycaons' owner makes for a compelling antagonist as well. Ideguchi and Kojima are  two-dimensional characters. They get some personality and develop a bit, but not a whole lot. The rest of the characters are pretty one-note. They're around and you might remember their names, but there isn't anything that really makes them unique or compelling. They're just \u201cthat guy who runs fast\u201d or \u201cthat guy with glasses.\u201d \\n\\n\r\nOne thing of note is that a lot of the antagonistic teams that Tokuchi and the Lycaons have to face are shown to have foreigners as their big guns. I'm not sure whether it's a demonstration of Xenophobia in which the great all-Japanese team has to face off against those foreign players who came from some unspecified location or it's just a coincidence. That being said, they do make it a point to bring the foreign players to the viewer's attention so the former seems more likely. \\n\\n\r\nArt:  \\n\\n\r\nThe art is pretty good, overall. The character designs are distinctive. The backgrounds are nicely detailed as well. That being said, there are some questionable art decisions. There are some ridiculously exaggerated expressions. For example, a \u201cshocked\u201d character might just open their mouth so wide they could fit their own head in there. Tokuchi also has an absurd hairstyle that makes him look like he's gone half super saiyan. I know, an anime with silly hair what an original concept. \\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\\n\r\nThe acting in this is okay. It doesn't stand out in any way, but it's passable. The music is really effective when it comes to atmosphere. The tense moments have a score that perfectly emphasises the tension as do the victorious moments. \\n\\n\r\nHo-Yay:\\n\\n\r\nThere is none in this series. 1/10.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts: \\n\\n\r\nIn some ways, One Outs is a typical piece of sports media. Underdog team pushing for victory. In others, it's not at all typical. The battle of wits aspect works pretty effectively and the main protagonist is an interesting character, even if most of the side characters are really flat. Still, it has quite a bit of intrigue and I do recommend checking it out for the battle of wits, if you don't mind watching grown men act like hitting a ball with a stick is a pastime of dire importance or a predictable plot arc. Final rating, 6/10. Next week I'll look at Shining Tears x Wind.",

            "content": "\u201cWinning is about trampling over corpses\u2026 It's not something beautiful. It's brutal. If you want to make it to the top- Steel yourselves.\u201d\r\nI'll admit I may be one of the only sports fans who doesn't care for baseball. Knowing this, the mention of a baseball-centered anime \u201cOne Outs\u201d did anything but grab my attention. However, through many friend recommendations and some quoted similarities to the suspenseful Kaiji series, I was ultimately drawn to it. Does it live up to its ranking inside the top 150 rated anime on all of MAL, or does it drown in its own hype?\r\nThe first thing I noticed about OneOuts is that it was produced by Madhouse, one of my all time favorite anime studios. The 2000\u2019s were some of their best years, so it's unfortunate but understandable that shows like this and RAINBOW were overlooked by the masses. We are introduced to the series with a description of the prestige regarding one of Japan\u2019s greatest baseball players, Hiromichi Kojima.  While training for the upcoming season, Kojima uncovers an underground gambling game infamously labeled \u201cOne Outs\u201d, betting a single pitcher against a respective batter. It is here that Kojima meets the smug-faced Tokuchi Toua and his illustrious baseball career is transformed forever.\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't say there's much there as far as story is concerned. There's more or less 4 mini-excerpts involving Tokuchi\u2019s introduction, and 3 game series between the Lycaon\u2019s (Tokuchi\u2019s team) and other teams in the Japanese minor league. In each of the mini-arcs, Tokuchi\u2019s mental prowess is showcased as he seeks to outwit the opposing team almost entirely by himself. There's one catch though. As a pitcher, Tokuchi is bound to a secretive contract developed by the owner of the Lycaons. Each out he gets earns him 5 million yen, while each run scored while he's on the mound costs him 50. Is his intellect and swagger enough to keep him afloat? With all the sinister tactics and tricks up his opponent\u2019s sleeves, One Outs lets a simple sport like baseball transcend into a chess match between the minds.\\n\\n\r\nTokuchi as a protagonist is undeniably refreshing, as he breaks the mold in almost every way possible. He's cutthroat, appears to not give a shit 90% of the time and is leagues above his competition in intelligence. The best part is the stark level of confidence he displays at every waking turn. Effortlessly outsmarting his foes into a stupor of shame and disbelief. He's living by the catchphrase of the anime: \u201cNobody wins but I!\u201d Tokuchi\u2019s focus on winning isn't always overtly expressed. I can't begin to mention the amount of times where he appeared lackadaisical, while the whole time plotting the enemy\u2019s demise. For fans of Kaiji\u2019s character, Tokuchi is almost a polar opposite archetype. To be honest, the two anime are almost completely different in terms of their approach to winning, but both somehow achieve a similar level of suspense that keeps you constantly pressing the button for the next episode.\\n\\n\r\nAs outlandish and unpredictable as Tokuchi\u2019s schemes sometimes appeared, I never had the thought \u201cthere\u2019s no way that would work!\u201d Every strategy fabricated in the anime has a sense of plausibility in it. Unfortunately, the repeated successes Tokuchi reaped only highlighted how dumb everyone else on his team was. There were countless instances where Tokuchi even exploited it by not coming forward with his plan and instead called everyone an idiot. It's like the writers were saying, \u201clook at dumb the Lycaon\u2019s are, but look at how smart Tokuchi is!\u201d I mean, even the blind mouse finds the cheese every once in awhile. At least toward the end of the series, Kojima and even the catcher Ideguchi began to sign on to Tokuchi\u2019s way of thinking. I would argue that almost every other character on the show is irrelevant because of how character driven the anime appears to be. Tokuchi Toua makes or breaks the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe only disappointing factor for me in One Outs was the lack of \u201chigh stakes\u201d mind games. Unlike Kaiji where literally every game is life and death, this anime only encompassed a few series of baseball games during the regular season. Even the curveballs (pun intended) the owner tries to throw our protagonist\u2019s way are easily thwarted without any real sense of urgency on his behalf. I would've rather seen the mind games take place in the playoffs or for a more \u201clife-threatening\u201d cause. In the end, the sheer amount of aha! moments and badass Tokuchi escapades made One Outs quite worthwhile. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation isn't the most flashy thing you'll see out of Madhouse, but given it\u2019s almost 10 years old at this point, it holds up decent enough. The character models aren't my favorite, but the artists did a fine job making each one distinguishable enough from the next, given this is a sports anime where there's a large cast and plenty of room to blend some faces together. The action animation was also quite detailed. Whether through the illustration of the American runner Johnson\u2019s spellbinding speed, or the dark moments when Tokuchi was dissecting his opponent\u2019s brain, I was entertained by the animation throughout. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP isn't one to remember. Nothing like the soothing, grainy cliche 2000\u2019s rock singer voice against the backdrop of our main protagonist shirtless and posing for the camera. Lol, wtf? I prefer when either the song matches the ambience or the theme of the show, and not some mishmash of genres just to appease certain demographics. At least that hair raising Deadman Wonderland OP actually tied into the anime somewhat. The ED is much more fitting, though nothing noteworthy enough to play through each episode. The background music is simplistic but effective. I actually liked the flow of the music into each scene as well. Masoto Hagiwara has a brilliant performance as Tokuchi, cementing him as one of my personal favorite voice actors.\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned before, I thoroughly enjoyed One Outs, and I would rank it up as a pleasant surprise in the medium. It's certainly not talked about as much as it should be, given its similarities to Kaiji and the fact that it's a sports anime. However, unlike other sports anime such as Haikyuu or Ping Pong, One Outs focuses almost solely on one character. If you don't care for Tokuchi\u2019s arrogance or conceited nature, One Outs may not be the anime for you. If you like a main protagonist out of the norm, and an intellectual game of tricks and twists, then I give it the fullest of recommendations. As always, thanks for reading and be sure to check out my other reviews!\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL- 7.5",

            "content": "\"Winning a game is not dependent on surpassing your opponents with your strength or waiting for lucky breaks. Conquer the opponent, crushing them, and stepping over the fallen ones ruthlessly. Winning means dominating over countless dead bodies.\"\r\nOne Outs, I admit, was never on my radar. It only recently caught my attention when I found out that Hagiwara Masato, known for voicing Kaiji Itou (a dumb gambler with a crazy lucky streak and serious cunning known for crazy come-from-behind victories), and Akagi Shigiru (an insane gambler with a crazy lucky streak and serious cunning known for crazy come-from-behind victories), would be voicing Tokuchi Towa, a pitchinggambler with a crazy lucky streak and serious cunning, known for crazy come-from-behind victories.\\n\\n\r\nIf I sound like I am mocking it, don't be fooled. One Outs provided for some seriously gripping drama that kept me from going to bed at decent hours, much like \"Kaiji\" and \"Akagi\" before it. Animated by Madhouse but not adapted from a manga by Nobuyuki Fukumoto, Madhouse took the lessons it learned from animating both \"Akagi\" and \"Kaiji\" Season One to put out an incredibly solid thriller that stands out as a great introduction to the manga series, and to psychological seinen gambling series. \\n\\n\r\n(Note: I will be making comparisons to both \"Akagi\" and \"Kaiji,\" mostly due to the similarities in theme, storytelling, and because Madhouse and Hagiwara Masato were both involved. No spoilers for either of those series to follow, and this review will cover the basic storyline without getting into the major twists.)\\n\\n\r\nStory - 8\\n\\n\r\nThe story is about a baseball team. The Lyacons are a team much like the Red Sox (before their awesome win in 2004), a losing team with a highly devoted fan base. The manager is a complete asshole, one who really doesn't care about if the team wins or loses, but if they can turn a profit with filling the seats. Kojima, the star player, goes to Okinawa for training, where he meets a mysterious pitcher who makes bets with people in a game called \"One Outs,\" a pitcher vs batter duel in which the pitcher must strike out the batter. Tokuchi, who had won 499 bets beforehand, barely loses to Kojima, in which Kojima gambled his retirement against Tokuchi's pitching hand, and is signed onto the Lyacons under a unique \"One Outs\" contract. \\n\\n\r\nThrow an out, earn 5 Million Yen. Let a runner score, lose 50 million. \\n\\n\r\nWhat follows are the first few games of the Lyacon's baseball season, with the typical arcs going in a pattern of learning about the opposing team, how high the stakes have been raised for Tokuchi, what crazy tricks the opposing team has to their advantage, and then Tokuchi systematically breaking down every single opponent that even tries to match his cunning. This is the basic story arc from \"Akagi\" (and Kaiji to a certain extent). If you're not ready for it, you might get sick of how many gosh dang times people underestimate Tokuchi and his planning, and how he basically not only saw through your plan but is actively undermining it AND turning it against you. It can get annoying, but part of the appeal is watching a genius like Tokuchi actually planning and counteracting seemingly clever plans while generally acting like a bored asshole (more on his character in a bit). This isn't to say the story is predictable: it's just that some might be turned off by what can sometimes feel like deceptive tension for the sake of tension. \\n\\n\r\nRegardless, even if you're not into baseball, the show more or less using baseball as the framing device for what are basically one-on-one duels of cunning and wits. You don't need to know a lot about baseball: just knowing the basic rules will help you get the most out of the show. It has a snappy pace that gives it the \"just one more episode\" feeling to every ending. The pacing is slow, for sure, but deliberately so. No episodes ever feel too long or short, with each story arc resolving nicely and carrying into the next one. The story ends around the end of the manga's first major story arc, and I can imagine the rest of the manga plays out much like the events that preceeded it. But thankfully, One Outs ends on a clean note; something that plagues \"Kaiji\" Season 1 and \"Akagi\" (Madhouse definitely took this lesson to heart for the end of \"Kaiji\" Season 2). \\n\\n\r\n(Note - Yes, I know it's not Madhouse's fault for the ending of \"Akagi.\" The duel with Washizu has been going on for 10 years. I went to a convenience store recently and saw the new chapter, and it doesn't look any closer to ending. Kubo Tite WISHES he could stretch out a manga like that.)\\n\\n\r\nThe drama works very well, and it is those intense psychological battles that carry the story through to the end. The drama, the dialogue, and the intense reactions to the events of the story work very well. The issue, I find, is when the story tries to be \"funny.\" While Kaiji and Akagi were occasionally sprinkled with bits of dark humor, it mainly kept the tension wound tighter then the seams on a baseball. \"One Outs'\" problem is with the material it is adapting: the moments of humor, be it the goofy reactions from the players or the visual metaphor of the manager being a dog is inconsistent with the themes and tone that One Outs tries to achieve. Nothing wrong with the occasional joke, but when a super serious moment has a moment of goofiness just kinda thrown in, the dissonance is really hard to ignore. Shows like \"One Outs,\" \"Kaiji,\" and \"Akagi\" are at their very best when it has a deep look into the hearts and minds of the key players in games of insane chance, skill, and wits. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, the bits of humor don't detract from the overall story. I can even see \"One Outs\" as being a great introduction to the style of storytelling present in \"Akagi\" and \"Kaiji,\" while not being as deathly serious. Plus, baseball fans are going to get a nice kick at all the care and attention that goes into dissecting and understanding the complexities of baseball, without getting in the way of the main plot threads spun by the devilishly clever Tokuchi. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 6\\n\\n\r\nThe art is my second-least favorite part about the series. They did a good job adapting the manga's look and style, but it doesn't help that the manga's style is not that great to begin with. It's just odd to see main characters with really strong, sharp lines and great design being placed next to characters that are outright comical. As I mentioned in the story, the dissonance is hard to ignore. \\n\\n\r\nTokuchi is the best designed character of the bunch, animating fluidly and really carrying the emotions and attitudes that come from a guy like him. While he may be stoic, even the most stoic of characters have traces of emotion, and Madhouse did a great job with him in general. The other character that make up the supporting cast work well along side of Tokuchi. While they are more \"normal\" looking, it helps make Tokuchi stand out more, which is a good thing (Bonus points to Madhouse for giving Tokuchi a long nose, much like the heroes in many of Nobuyuki Fukumoto's works). Tokuchi is a very weird, mysterious guy that you can't help but notice, even in a crowd; and the art design carries this well. Characters like Kojima and Ideguchi help complete the contrast: Tokuchi is a thin, stoic, and sharp mouthed punk. Ideguchi is an emotional, stout catcher who wears his heart on his sleeve, and Kojima is a serious minded and broad, imposing man who is still approachable and humble. Madhouse clearly put a lot of thought into this dynamic, and it works out well. The three take up the most screen time, and the animation helps carry out these character moments when they are not talking. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the other characters, they don't get the same love. Many of the faces on the Lyacon's team are bland, and comical in comparison. It's ultimately kind-of-distracting, as their faces enter the frame, and instead of remembering them when they leave it, you end up annoyed because they took away valuable face time from the three main characters. There are good details on Tokuchi's opponents, but not many stand out. But with some of the antagonists, they're designed well enough to carry the idea that these are the kind of people who would go against Tokuchi in a battle of some kind. \\n\\n\r\nBackgrounds are the weakest part. Most of the action takes place in baseball diamonds, and Madhouse fell flat in this regard. While there are moments of intense action that work really well, they really don't capture the full excitement of a baseball game. They use strong visual metaphors, but they're not as clever or well defined as the ingenious metaphors found within \"Kaiji\" or \"Akagi.\" One would think that all that time spent animating \"Hajime No Ippo\" would give Madhouse some ideas on how to make baseball, which is typically seen as a dreadfully boring sport to watch (never watch baseball on TV if it's not a Tournament game) into a heart-pounding battle of wills. Ultimately, it simply only works some of the time, and is merely the plate in which the meal is delivered on, not being as finely crafted as the other elements.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 5\\n\\n\r\nSound was... ok. The ED is forgivable, and OP is just better off skipped. Granted, considering how perfect \"Kaiji\" Season 2's opening was, I might be the wrong person to ask.\\n\\n\r\nBackground music did it's job without standing out. The show has wonderfully exciting moments, and has appropriate background music when needed, but other then Tokuchi's theme, no track really stands out. Madhouse did amazing work with \"Akagi\" and \"Kaiji\" in terms of OST; a forgettable soundtrack is a sin. \\n\\n\r\nIt's not bad, it's not great. It's like a part-time worker: just punches in and punches out without making an impression. It's a damn shame, too. Music is what makes shows like these so gripping and exciting, and they just did an average job. \\n\\n\r\nAt this point I've been railing against the show really heavilly. But the next part is what makes the whole thing worth it. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter/Voice Acting - 9\\n\\n\r\nI have no idea what it is about Hagiwara Masato, but the people who make important decisions at Madhouse have figured out that by giving this guy an insane gambler to voice, he will nail it so perfectly it will give you chills. It's one thing to be a one trick pony, but this pony can do a really freaking good trick. Masato captures the essence of this character perfectly, with a deceptively monotone voice that is filled with the cunning of a demon behind every syllable. He's assure of himself that seems like arrogance to people who don't understand him. He's a punk who plays the fool so well that his deception will trap you before you even realize what is going on. And when he delivers lines about putting your life into a game, or when he's says that he will take out the next batter in 3 pitches, it pierces you like an untarnished blade that looks like it has not drawn blood until the very last moment. \\n\\n\r\nHe's really good, that's what I am saying. While Akagi was a genius who seemed bored all the time (And Kaiji was just in a league all of his own), this character is one of a troubled man. A guy who knows he is smart, and feels like he is a giant among men. But the difference here is that once he gets with the Lyacon's, you get the idea that he genuinely cares about people other then himself. While he is motivate by money and thrills, he wants to make others better. He gives encouragement, gives credit for his ideas to others, and all-in-all seems like a guy who really wants to have this team win. Tokuchi feels like a more likeable version of Akagi, in which he teaches harsh lessons to improve others. Then he crushes his opponents like a man who can only feel pleasure in overcoming insane odds, and then rubbing salt in the wound. The quote at the top captures his mentality perfectly, and Masato's voice acting carries it beautifully. While many of the other characters might be one note, he manages to conduct a symphony and uses every single limited note to create a wonderful character piece into the mind of a man who lives on the very edges of luck and skill. \\n\\n\r\nJust listen to Tokuchi. The other voice actors turn in great performances, but it's all Masato's show. So with the voice acting, character arc, and story, it all hinges on how much you like this guy's voice. He's a great voice actor, and his strength carries the show to new heights. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall - 8\\n\\n\r\nI marathoned \"Kaiji\" Seasons 1 and 2 in about the span of 2 weeks or so. I went through \"Akagi\" in a few days. Likewise, \"One Outs\" came and went quick, but was still a great ride. I was seriously pumping my fist by the end, and the tension often kept me from getting a decent night sleep before work. \"One Outs\" is a lot like the title character: Singularly minded; but extremely brilliant at it's one talent. The art and music may not do much, but the well told drama along with with great voicework puts \"One Outs\" over the top, and rarely strikes out. \\n\\n\r\n4 out of 5.",

            "content": "This anime was partially enjoyable, but my enjoyment was mostly overshadowed by what I see as failed potential. One Outs starts out with a world of potential with the interesting and enigmatic main character, genius pitcher Tokuchi Toua. The supporting characters are interesting as well and immediately given impressive backstory and development. The atmosphere seemed to be setting up for a great baseball journey and even the narrator promised that great unforeseen events would happen later on. However, after the first few introductory episodes the series levels out and becomes uninteresting focusing on one long match after another. Many people say this series is likeDeath Note with baseball. It is NOT like Death Note with baseball. There is a distinct lack of arch rivalry, but an abundance of Toua\u2019s god mode. The series disappointed me because 1)Toua\u2019s character never grows, changes, or gets a backstory, and 2) The matches got boring once I realized that they all followed one pattern: \\n\\n\r\nOpponents: \u201cShenanigans! Let\u2019s use dirty tricks, genius, mind games, cheating, and/or raw talent to try and make Toua lose!\u201d \\n\r\nToua : \u201cHaha, nice try but I\u2019m god\u201d Toua then proceeds to own everyone. \\n\\n\r\nThis in and of itself is already an insult to the viewer, but it was made worse by making the matches long and trying to delude us into believing that Toua was actually taking risks and gambling, even though he was pretty much perfect. I\u2019m ok with Gary Stu\u2019s as long as the show is interesting and suspenseful, but unfortunately for me this show was boring. My breakdown will go into a little more detail about the qualities I liked and disliked in this series. There were some aspects I liked, but ultimately this was a frustrating watching experience.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\nThe series started off with great potential and a very interesting main character, but eventually plateaued. The plot doesn\u2019t go very far and many episodes were spent on a single game. Over-emphasis on tricks, sneaky strategies and mind screwing. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nTokuchi Toua was always god-mode mind reading, always right, and always confident. We never get much depth into his charcter, thoughts or background. I like overpowered characters, but only if they come with a background, and at least the illusion of having struggles and growth. These things make it easier for the viewer to root for the character.  Toua doesn\u2019t seem to grow or learn anything. He\u2019s just teaching and showing everybody else. He has an other-wordly quality to him that I really like. But in an anime like this where everything else and everyone else is realistic, it only contributed to the disconnect I felt with the show and with Toua. Toua\u2019s teammates were mostly stupid and incapable and had to rely on Toua. Opponents had a monster-of-the-week feel to them.\\n\\n\r\nOne the show\u2019s main villains, the team\u2019s owner, was another major weakness. Tokuchi spent much of his time and effort just trying to defeat him. Why did the owner have to be the main foil?  It was annoying, and a great hindrance to the plot and the story\u2019s development. It was as if he (Tokuchi) was stuck in a permanent holding pattern fighting against the boss. \\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound\\n\r\nThe animation was pretty good, and the music was just okay. Not bad, but forgettable. Overall, the voice acting was good, but I think that Toua\u2019s VA was miscast.\\n\\n\r\nThe Bottom Line: While the show was by no means terrible and had some enjoyable moments it ultimately let me down, and I feel like watching this wasn\u2019t worth my time. I\u2019d discourage others from viewing this as well. There are many other psychological and sports shows out there that are better than this.\\n",

            "content": "Hands down my favorite anime.  I've rewatched it twice and if it were possible to erase my memories of what happens in this anime, I would likely rewatch it many more times.  Now, without further ado...\r\n[Story: 10]\r\nThe story revolves around a man named Toua Tokuchi, whose background is effectively unknown.  All we know is that he excels in a form of gambling through baseball called \"One Outs.\"  This seems to be a theme in madhouse animes, such as Kaiji and Akagi, where the character's past remains a mystery and unknown throughout the story.  Anyways, Toua is finally defeated in OneOuts by a man nicknamed the \"unlucky prodigy batter\" Hiromichi Kojima, and due to the stakes of the gamble, Toua leaves the gambling world to lend his prowess to the weakest team in the Japanese Pacific League: the Saitama Lycaons.  I won't post any spoilers, but basically the story from here on out is Toua's \"conquests\" of one team after another, using his sharp wit and gambling instincts to overcome star players, intelligent strategists, and even cheating on the opposing team's part to emerge victorious all while making a pretty penny off his special \"One Outs\" contract.  A great addition is the current tally of Toua's salary due to the contract at the end of every few episodes and by near the end of the series, that number is scary huge.\\n\\n\r\n[Art: 9]\\n\r\nNot outstanding but gets the job done.  The way every character is drawn beautifully reflects their personality (i.e. Toua looks almost sinister at times) and as such really enhances the cinematic effect of the anime.  It is also fairly realistic, unlike the weird style used in Kaiji and Akagi (although I found that style appropriate for those animes).  Since, the story and character are so great, however, I'm not giving art much weight toward the final rating.\\n\\n\r\n[Sound: 8]\\n\r\nOP and ED are decent (nothing special) and sound effects are accurate and well-executed.  BGM is fairly limited but it does a good job setting the right mood.  Like art, it's pretty overshadowed by the story and as such won't factor much into the final rating.\\n\\n\r\n[Character: 10]\\n\r\nThere are several \"round\" characters in the anime (characters that develop in terms of character and maturity), though surpirsingly one of them is not the protagonist (Toua Tokuchi).  I'm referring to the Lycaons team as a whole.  Throughout the course of the anime, they change for the better.  But Toua, the protagonist, does not.  So then, why do I still award a 10 for character?  The answer is that Toua's character still works beautifully.  He remains the cool, calculating, canniving SOB from begininning to end and while this personality doesn't change within him, it changes his teammates for the better.  Through watching him win games with his cunning, you will see the Lycaons as a whole evolve from a downtrodden team that's last in the pennant race to one that is much more positive and has a better outlook on things by the end of the series.  So what's amazing is not Toua's ability to change and become a better man himself, but rather his undeniable ability to lead and change every man on his team.\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment: 10]\\n\r\nAfter everything I've said before, the 10 I awarded in enjoyment should be self-explanatory.  If you don't care for baseball, or even dislike baseball, but have an appreciation of strategy and psychology among other things, I think this anime will still blow your socks off.  This anime is easily addicting enough to make you want to watch the whole thing in one eight hour sitting.\\n\\n\r\n[Overall: 10]\\n\r\nAn outstanding anime and my favorite overall.  Death Note, Code Geass and a number of other greats don't even come close to this in my book, although I enjoyed them very much.",

            "content": "*Note* This is my first review, so any feedback on how I can make it better/more useful to the reader is greatly appreciated :), thanks in advance.\r\nAt first glance, One Outs may seem to be based around baseball, but that's merely the medium used to deliver the psychological warfare that is entailed within this anime.\r\nStory (9/10):\r\nThe story is revolved around a pitcher named Tokuchi Toua (who has had no previous 'official' experience as a professional baseball playe) and how he 'joins' the Lycoans to help them increase their ranking. \r\nThe story in itself is nothing special, but there are 2 aspects to this anime thatmake it interesting:\\n\\n\r\nFirstly, Tokuchi's pitching is actually pretty average, even arguably below the standard of a professional baseball player. However, it's not his pitch that is his weapon, but rather his genius mind that he uses in order to out-wit his opponents.\\n\\n\r\nSecondly, Tokuchi's contract is not that of your average baseball player, he gains 5,000,000 yen for every person he strikes out but loses 50,000,000 yen for every run scored while he is on the mound.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7/10):\\n\r\nThe art was nothing spectacular but wasn't an eye-sore either. It did it's job.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10):\\n\r\nThe voice acting was well done, each voice suited it's character - especially Tokuchi's. The way the actor speaks as Tokuchi is a perfect reflection on how Tokuchi is portrayed through his actions. The music used did it's job and enhanced the experience, but the soundtracks used aren't really what you'd listen to outside of watching anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7/10):\\n\r\nThe characters you get are the characters you expect, Tokuchi is a calm and calculating genius while the others are just your average baseball player. One Outs only really focuses on a handful of people while the others are just hurdles to overcome or a tool to be used.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10):\\n\r\nOne outs doesn't get boring, it's not one of those shows where material is just reused and recycled. Each match played is unique to itself and the way Tokuchi manages to deal with every 'impossible' scenario never fails to impress eiether. There are also elements of comedy mixed in here and there aswell.\\n\\n\r\nAs a conclusion, i'll say that i rated One Outs as a 10/10 for it's entertaining set-up. The show also requires no prior experience in baseball to understand what's going on, making it an easy watch for all anime lovers world wide.",

            "content": "I don't really watch sport anime since this is not genre I enjoy but this is actually a gambling anime in disguise as sport anime. The anime has it pros and cons:\r\nThe Good\r\n1. Mind game\r\nThe mind game and the plot twist is not as thrilling as Death Note, Liar Game or any other mind game anime/manga but it is still enjoyable to watch.\r\n2. Gambling anime disguise as sport anime\r\nThis is something we don't see quite often so this is actually quite unique because it felt new. Not to mention, it can easily attract people who is not interest in sport anime. So, for people whonever watch sport anime or never interested in sport anime, this will be their first sport anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe Bad\\n\r\n1. Art style\\n\r\nWeird and uninteresting art style. Especially the main protagonist looks like blond hair Hisoka from Hunter x Hunter.\\n\\n\r\n2. OST\\n\r\nThe ost is not really that nice or memorable.\\n\\n\r\n3. Gambling anime disguise as sport anime\\n\r\nThis depend on people actually. If the people who is like me, not really interested in sport anime, this is the anime where we will find quite enjoyable and new but for those who is into sport anime, might be a little disappointed since this anime aren't typically baseball anime they used to watch unless they are ok with psychological genre (of course, don't expect the mind game to be better than other psychological anime have watch before)\\n\\n\r\n4. Baseball\\n\r\nI know nothing about baseball so sometime when they explain the rule of baseball really confuse me and not to mention, they mix it with mind game which sometimes make me more confuse. It would be appreciate if they do what Death Note does. In Death Note, in the middle of every episode (aka commercial break) there is \"How to use Death Note\" rule explanation so we anime watcher can pause the video and read the rule and when we understand the rule a little, we can get what is going on with the story.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nDespite its cons, the anime is still enjoyable however, if you are watching this anime because of baseball, then I suggest it's best you skip this because it is not the same baseball anime you used to watch before unless you are ok with psychology genre but do not expect the mind game is as good as other psychology anime because the plot twist is not really that strong. This anime is worth to watch when you don't have good anime to watch this season because it's still an enjoyable anime to past your time.",

            "content": "All hail the almighty Tokuchi Toua: A man of many strengths and no flaws. For many this can be an appealing trait for a lead character, but for me it was an eventual cause for boredom in what was supposed to be a high stakes drama.\r\nOne Outs did begin on a strong note, introducing a gambling spin on a national pastime with the odds heavily stacked against an enigmatic character, but over time it became increasingly apparent that no one would challenge Tokuchi. He gets whatever he wants, when he wants, however he wants it, and never shows any shred of vulnerability. One Outs ismost often compared to Kaiji the Ultimate Survivor, but in that show the main character is is the very opposite of invincible. He loses. A lot, and pays a major price as a result. We even learn about his life in the very first episode, and there are a wide variety of games played as opposed to just baseball with a cheating spin. \\n\\n\r\nOne Punch Man offers a similar divide in the talents of a lead and everyone else, but that's the literal joke constantly being played for laughs while being complimented by god tier animation and actual good supporting characters. One Outs offers none of this. It's often ugly to look at with no memorable character aside from the lead. Kojima was poised to be a rival of Tokuchi's and a supposed budding superstar in the baseball world, but he is practically invisible in actual matches presumably to show just how helpless the team is without their savior Tokuchi Christ.\\n\\n\r\nDespite its aforementioned flaws, One Outs is not a bad anime. The actual strategy executed by Tokuchi is interesting especially in the end where it reaches a fever pitch. The OST's are memorable tracks that I'll be playing on long commutes for the foreseeable future. Tokuchi may be an one dimensional overpowered god, but he is a cool character with a level of intellect on par with the greatest minds in anime. One Outs does a lot well, but the things I'd expect to be most impressed with I instead left dissatisfied. Does not help that the anime doesn't cover the full story, and stops short of the Lycanons season truly beginning.\\n\\n\r\nI understand why this anime is well regarded within the community, but for me it did not live up to its reputation and is closer to mediocre than a masterpiece of any sort.",

            "content": "this isn't really a sports anime, despite using baseball as a vehicle, and it isn't really a gambling show either, despite the lead character Tokuchi being an inveterate gambler.  it is primarily a sort of mystery -- i got the most out of trying to figure out what Tokuchi was thinking, and how he would foil his enemies.\r\nthe premise of the story is unique and interesting, and i enjoyed the progression of a lengthy set of episodes each showing Tokuchi being pitted against various nefarious villains.  mind, i didn't enjoy the villains, they were all one-note characters, bad guys through and through, constantlyoveracting, and therefore boring.  but the way Tokuchi outthinks them is very entertaining.  it would be even better if one could actually follow through all the complex twists and turns, but alas the writing doesn't allow for that much of the time.  the pacing was overall good, except for the cliffhangers which sometimes seemed very artificial -- but if you marathon the show they won't bother you.\\n\\n\r\ni love the art.  the character design is excellent at conveying the traits of each character -- Tokuchi is all sharp angles and planes, Kojima looks solid, honest, reliable, Ideguchi is wide-eyed naivete, the coach all large flapping lips.  Even tertiary characters are all unique.  the background art is generally good with detail, and sometimes is astonishingly beautiful in its play with light.  alas the animation is mediocre; too often speed lines replace actual movement.\\n\\n\r\nthe voice acting is nothing special, a few seiyuu i especially like had supporting roles, but they didn't stand out.  it's always difficult for me to judge voice actors when the role calls for a character who is overacted by design, since i can't stand overacting, it's a bad mark against the seiyuu either way.  Tokuchi is voiced by Hagiwara Masato (Akagi, Kaiji -- oh look, a theme!), with whom i am not terribly familiar; Tokuchi is very controlled, almost speaks with a  monotone.  BGM is good and fits the story.  the OP grated on my nerves; the singer sounded like he was having problems with his bowel movement, though the music itself wasn't all bad. there's a bit of fanservice in the opening for those who like naked men (i'm all for that, but Tokuchi doesn't really turn my crank).  the ED... umm.  you know, i have already forgotten it.\\n\\n\r\nthe characters are what is most responsible for my low score.  basically only Tokuchi is worth mentioning, and he is very smart, albeit not likeable, and he doesn't develop at all.  there is the thinnest of backstories for him, and for Kojima.  as already mentioned, we have one-note villains, and their motivations are simplistic.  Tokuchi's team mates are largely too stupid to believe, we have no story on them and they don't grow/change.  all that beautiful character design wasted on total zeroes when it comes to personality.\\n\\n\r\nis it worth watching?  for me it was; i enjoyed trying to puzzle out the ways in which Tokuchi would outfox his enemies.  i learned a small bit of math i had previously been unaware of.  i'll probably rewatch it just to think through the puzzling parts again.  if you need your story to make sense, this isn't for you -- it is utterly implausible that anything like this could happen, though i guess it's more likely than giant robots fighting it out with swords.  if you're looking for decent baseball action, don't look here, though there are a couple good bits on strategy, and it does help if you know baseball.  i don't think this has any historical value; it won't become a classic.  it did suck me in and kept me watching, and i'll remember it, but it's not sufficiently good for me to buy it.\\n\\n\r\nthe score i gave seems low, but i just started using a new, more finely grained scoring system, and i think i'll have to lower many of my scores.  what sunk this show to a 6 is the lack of character personality and development, and the lazy animation.\\n",

A trash team trying to make to the top with the help of Tokuchi Toua a Bad ass genius manipulative gambler \"Hisoka-ish\" type of character who can read minds and body language. \r\nthe HUGE flaw in this anime was the character development, all of them made out to be absolute clueless idiots, both teammates and opponents  \r\nwhilein the other hand the blonde guy is perfect and unbelievably smart never breaks a sweat, always in god-mode always right and never struggle or show any signs of weakness   \\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't recommend it\\n\r\nthere is not enough back stories, or hints of comedy or drama outside and inside the field, no relationship and friendship, no female characters, zero character development even the MC.. its just a slow boring anime trying so hard to be psychological and deep.",

            "content": "One Outs is a very positive surprise and another hidden gem that has not received as much spotlight as it deserves. I was initially very skeptical about watching this series as I am not very familiar with Baseball. However, the full-of-suspense story and the mentally strong protagonist are extremely captivating.\r\nMost sports anime stories focus on physical prowess of players, their talent and the built-up of a character before he becomes the big star. One Outs is very different in that regards. It focuses entirely on mind games, psychology manipulation, strategy, tactics, gambling, cheating and deception to achieve one's goal. It is about using your brainand all means at your disposal to win the psychological warfare rather than magically overcoming everything with sheer strength and strong resolve.\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist reminds a lot of mentally strong characters and tacticians such as L from Death Note or Lelouch from Code Geass. The story has a good pace with a lot of anxious anticipation of how the main character will overcome the challenges presented to him. It is realistic and provides some valuable lessons to the watcher about the importance of having strong mentality and unwavering psychology, be it in sports or in other spectra of real life. The series does not go into depth explaining everything about Baseball but it still clarifies the important bits. The animation and character design is good. The music is decent, not very memorable since it is all about mind games and not about aesthetically epic moments complimented by music. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, it is a great series and a very enjoyable watch. If you are a fan of strong and dominant protagonists, mind games, gambling and psychological warfare, do not miss this one!",

            "content": "One Outs was an overall enjoyable series that was definitely worth the watch. It contained an interesting and rather original premise, and captured my attention from the early episodes. However, it was not without it's flaws.\r\nStory 8/10: \r\nThe general concept of the show was great. It was original, enjoyable and entertaining. But there were some aspects of the writing that became somewhat repetitive about halfway through the series. It adopted a \"Villain of the week\" sort of approach, where each baseball team had some sort of unstoppable player that had to be taken out. There was also no sense of what happens outside of thestadium, and while I know that the series' main purpose is to showcase the psychology of baseball games, it would have been nice to see some of the world that the characters were living in. \\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10:\\n\r\nStandard quality Madhouse animation. A bit basic, but no major flaws or anything. Nothing really much to say, as it is Madhouse.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10:\\n\r\nI loved the OST of this series. Everything fit the scene perfectly, whether there was supposed to be tension, conflict, or just happy times, the music that accompanied the scene was spot on. The opening song as well was really good, something I would listen to for leisure. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10:\\n\r\nTo me, this is where the series falls a bit short. Don't get me wrong, while the characters were good, entertaining to watch, and made me care about them, they were not as fleshed out as they could be. For instance, we never even find out Tokuchi's back story, and how he became the Japanese DemiGod of baseball. And while I know that the anime only contains half what the original source material did, and that it may not be it's fault due to lack of run time, it still is a detriment to what could have been some of the most interesting characters (Tokuchi in particular) for this sort of genre.\\n\\n\r\nDespite it lacking in certain areas, One Outs really is a fantastic show, that is worthwhile and entertaining. If you liked the psychological mind games of Death Note and Kaiji, then it is almost impossible to not like One Outs",

At first, I thought that this is just a typical sports anime wherein they train and strive to become champions but it turns out its not. Even if you are not a baseball fan, you will still enjoy watching this. You don't even need to understand baseball just to watch this. I'd say its more like gambling than baseball. I liked the way how he crushes his enemies under his feet so that they could not get back up. The characters arewell-developed and the story is so great that it will make you watch for more. I can also say that Tokuchi is the smartest anime character. The sound effects fit perfectly for every situation the team is in. The art is not that commendable but suits this show. You won't find heroines or female characters here but so what? It is still a great show. Every episode will make you adore Tokuchi. I highly recommend it for all especially to those who likes dark and intellectual animes.",

He's just the definition of a bad ass and that's really what makes this anime so great. The supporting characters in my opinion were not that well developed but the performance of Tokuchi more then made up for that minor loss.\r\nThe score was simply beautiful when it was shown, the art was magnificient howeverlike I said sometimes the supporting characters didn't seem like they had a lot of progress. The antognist was your typical greedy SOB which made you cringe when you saw him. \\n\\n\r\nHowever the main part of this anime is suspense. You can't enter an episode and not wonder what is gonna happen next, that is how well this anime is made. It keeps you guessing and let me tell you, good luck guessing how Toua thinks, because it's damn near impossible. \\n\\n\r\nOverall a 9/10, it's definetely an overlooked anime that deserves some light.

            "content": "\u201cNobody wins, but I!\u201d, the subtitle of the series, couldn\u2019t be more accurate. \r\nOne Outs is the story of the extremist gambler Toua Tokuchi, his battle to completely crush his opponents in the Japanese Pacific Baseball League and, perhaps less importantly to the pitcher, earn a beefy salary while doing so. While advantageous, and likely to increase one's enjoyment of the series, a deep knowledge of the sport of Baseball is not required. Make no mistake; the series is first and foremost about the character, rather than the vehicle used to display his feats.\r\nThe story begins in the island of Okinawa, with the star playerof the Lycaons, Kojima Hiromichi, training for the upcoming season in the hopes of leading the dismal team to the championships. It is here the title game is revealed to be a betting competition between batter and pitcher, with both sides attempting to overwhelm and suppress the other respectively. Tokuchi is revealed to be the undisputed king of the game, and through multiple matches with Lycaons members and Kojima himself, Tokuchi loses his first contest yet and agrees to join the Lycaons at the behest of Kojima, who believes he can lead the team to victory.\\n\\n\r\nIt is here that the primary antagonist is revealed, and the driving gamble of the series is set. The Lycaons team owner, Saikawa, is only concerned with money and the return he can get on stadium seating compared to his losses from expenses such as the players salary. As an all-too-intriguing prospect to Tokuchi and Saikawa, the One Outs contract is formed, granting Tokuchi 5,000,000 yen for every out he acquires as pitcher, but a deduction of 50,000,000 yen for every run he gives up.  Thus the stage is set for a battle between the two, whilst Tokuchi also has to deal with the other teams in the league and the various methods he must dispel to win the game with a profit. A fun and smart little addition to the series is the revealed sum of Tokuchi\u2019s current salary, usually given after every few games, to give the viewer an idea of just how much the strategist is escaping with.\\n\\n\r\nToua Tokuchi (And his very black & white view of winning & losing) is very much the star here, with even the over-lording antagonist being delegated to a role of being completely outwitted and shocked at each loss. In this sense, the series is very much like another oft-compared Madhouse anime, Akagi (In fact, both characters share the same voice actor, Masato Hagiwara). The spotlight is always on the overly-confident, cold-blooded genius, and you seldom if ever really feel like he\u2019s going to lose, no matter what the predicament. If this isn\u2019t your type of thing, One Outs might not be right for you, and another Madhouse gambling series, Kaiji, is likely more up your alley. Secondary characters such as Kojima and the catcher, Satoshi Ideguchi, essentially act as reasons for Tokuchi to explain his plans, though they occasional prove useful on their own, and the owner is always most concerned with ways to recoup his losses on the games with Tokuchi.\\n\\n\r\nThe rival teams all have various methods for victory, from star players to expert strategy to outright cheating, and watching these plans be revealed, falter, and be destroyed in kind by Tokuchi\u2019s insight never gets tiring. The extents of the wild gambler\u2019s methods are seen to truly reach their peak during the team\u2019s third match with most powerful squad in the league, the Mariners. As if controlling puppets on a string, he turns the game into a farce just barely within the rules, with both teams striving for errors and various other foul plays in a race against time. Another example has him practicing the principles of \u201can eye for an eye\u201d, responding to an intentional pitch thrown to injure him with throwing the bat at the pitcher during his swing. As all the teams have multi-layered paths to their own victory, the three-game series\u2019 are never over too quickly, as both sides continually adjust in an attempt to corner the other. Many of the \u201ctricks\u201d aren\u2019t easy to discern by oneself, and will paste a smile on your face or have you laughing manically upon the eventual reveal and Tokuchi subsequently using it against the opponents.\\n\\n\r\nThe series artwork is fairly realistic, with exception of characters like the Manager and Assistant Manager who are drawn in the fashion of comic relief. The series makes use of a few foreign (Essentially American) players as well, and draw then is somewhat stereotypical fashion, but still utilizing good designs. It seems Madhouse also wanted to appeal to female otaku in the series as well, with the OP housing continual shots of Tokuchi shirtless and looking aloof.\\n\\n\r\nThe audio work in One Outs is fitting, but the musical side never really rises above. It all fits great in the series and never feels out of place, but it\u2019s also not really a soundtrack you would listen to outside of the anime. The voice acting is done really well, with Tokuchi\u2019s voice actor, Masato Hagiwara, easily stealing the show thanks to his familiarity in the role (And gambling anime in general) thanks to his previous work as the title characters in Akagi and Kaiji. The Lycaons manager also performs admirably in his efforts at comic relief, making it a bit hard not to chuckle every time he calls for a \u201csafety bunt-o\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nThe series provides everything a viewer could want in a series based on mental and/or gambling, and the use of baseball allows all 25 episodes to remain fresh thanks to the numerous ways the rules can be warped and the loopholes that can be exploited. Anyone looking for series revolving around plans, schemes, and overall mental talent will certainly not be disappointed.",

            "content": "So, One Outs is an anime about sports, right? Hell no! Its about Tokuchi owning everyone and kicking their asses! Its very similar to Akagi, so if you enjoyed that the chances are VERY slim that you wont enjoy this one as well!\r\nStory\r\nWell, the story itself isnt really anything special, Its about Tokuchi Toua who is a genius pitcher. He kinda gets forced to join the lowly ranked Lycaons baseball team. Of course his goal is to make their team start winning their matches. So the basic story is pretty ordinary as you can see, but there are two things that makes the whole thinga lot more interesting. The first is how the matches are played. The Lycaons opponents always have better players overall, or some kind of ace up their sleeve and one team is even cheating. Now its Tokuchis job to destroy these opponents using his brilliant mind. Thats right, One Outs is actually more about strategies and mind games than actuall baseball. \\n\\n\r\nThe second twist is that Tokuchi gets 5 000 000 yen for every out he pitches, but loses 50 000 000 yen for every point he gives up. And the Lycaons manager cares more about making money out of Tokuchi than winning the actuall games, so he tries to make his own team lose! So outsmarting the other teams is not enough for Tokuchi, he has to fight on two fronts also preventing the manager from ruining the games with his interference. This puts Tokuchi in all kinds of impossible situations, but he always succeeds in coming up with a counter-strategy, and watching this is a blast! The best part is that all of Tokuchis strategies makes perfect sense after they are explained! You never feel like the creators are cheating and leaving out unexplained or logically invalid bits and pieces.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nNot a particularly interesting point. Its good, it does the job, it doesnt bother you. \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nNot that this matters or affects the score in anyway, but Ill still say it: The OP was pretty good, I actually watched it which I often dont. But of course the important stuff is the bgm and the voices. And well, I have no complaints, they were both very good. The music fit in great with the intense and exciting atmosphere. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nOk, Tokuchi himself is awesome. He is one of the most badass characters ever. Nothing ever fazes him. Even if the situation is looking extremely bad he still remains cold and calculating, soon to be delivering his new plan that will eliminate all his obstacles. The thing is that the other characters are not even half as interesting. They are either tools for him to use, or obstacles for him to completely destroy, using these tools. And thats pretty much it. Of course it doesnt really matter seeing how the point of the show is watching when Tokuchi kicks ass. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nThis show never really gets boring. You know Tokuchi is always going to win, but it doesnt matter, because seeing him in action is just too freakin awesome. Also, finding out HOW he will to get out of all the imossible situations and what kind of strategies he comes up with, is another important part. The only complaint here is that it is a bit slow sometimes, but you get so caught up in it that it doesnt really matter at all. \\n\\n\r\nSo, One Outs is a show about mind games and tricks more than baseball, and if you like that kind of stuff you must try this one. And yeah, if you like badass characters owning everyone then thats another reason to watch this. Even if you dont give it a try, because its awesome!",

            "content": "\"Winner takes all. This is the universal rule of battle.\" - Toua Tokuchi. \r\nOne Outs, for the most part, only caught my attention after I was looking for similar titles to the recent sports anime, Diamond no Ace. After taking a look at the synopsis I considered it and put it in plan-to-watch only to start and end it months later but in a rather very quick time. \r\nThe story sets off in the island of Okinawa, where the pinch-hitter of the struggling and fictional Lycaons team, Kojima Hiromichi, heads off to form a training camp in hopes of reclaiming the ultimate prize that isthe Japanese Baseball Championship. When a minor league pitcher who trains with Kojima gets injured, him and Kojima's trainer are forced to look for a replacement, but this is when they run into a group of people who seem to play a shady game of gambling related to Baseball, named \"One Outs\". It's apparently a one-on-one between the batter and the pitcher but with money on the line. After completely losing out to a mysterious pitcher named Toua Tokuchi, Kojima arrives at the scene next day to avenge his teammates and find this mysterious pitcher and defeat him. Things don't go as planned for him though as even he is completely beaten by Tokuchi and is forced to conceal himself from the people for a week. After some days, though, Kojima finally returns and seeks a rematch with Tokuchi Toua once again. This time though, he urges Tokuchi that he'd retire from professional Baseball at once if he loses, but then tells Tokuchi that if he wins he'd take an arm off Tokuchi in order to make sure he never gambles on Baseball again. Tokuchi promptly agrees to the deal and faces off with Kojima once again. Circumstances make Tokuchi lose his first ever \"One Outs\" game and readily offers his arms to Kojima, but he tells that he never said he'd \"break\" his arm but simply \"take it\" as he grasps Tokuchi's right arm. Kojima urges Tokuchi, who has exceptional potential in Baseball, to join his team Lycaons and help them to win the Championship. Thus beginning his first step towards professional Baseball. Not long after he meets the Owner of the Lycaons, who refuses to give up any significant amount of salary to Tokuchi for his yet unknown abilities, Tokuchi then proposes an unusual ordeal, he tells that for every out he pitches, he'd get 5,000,000 yen but loses 50,000,000 yen for every run he gives up.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the artwork of the series as we move on, I have come across a few criticism's that it's pretty poor and not aesthetically pleasing. I, however, believe it's the opposite of that where the art actually stands out on top. I'm not an avid reader of Manga's and haven't read the One Outs manga either, but I can say that the art is top-notch throughout the series. It was indeed the striking poster of Tokuchi Toua that got me interested in it, and it isn't any different in the anime either, full marks for that. And I'm not comparing the two by any means but if you see the artwork of Death Note, a similar and much popular psychologically-hit anime and One Outs, you could say that it's Death Note that lacked a bit in art. This is just my opinion though, anyway. \\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the Opening and Ending themes of One Outs as well as the soundtrack, which are pretty okay in comparison to the whole anime. They both practically just do the standard work of an opening and an ending theme, that's pretty much how I'd put it. The ending theme however was pretty good and made me search for the full version on Youtube and it was pretty nice. \\n\\n\r\nThe show is fully centered around our mastermind Tokuchi Toua, and the Owner being the antagonist. In terms of enjoyment, One Outs never disappoints and it kept me in the edge of my seat throughout the entire series. Game after game you are left astounded by the various shrewd and astute tactics by Tokuchi Toua. \\n\\n\r\nIt was only long after since I actually came across this anime for the first time that I started watching. And I managed to finish it off in a week but was left astounded as to what a great gem of a show this is. Compared to its various psychological thriller hits, its highly underrated and mostly overlooked just because it's based on the concept of Baseball and not many people are aware of the game. That being said I can guarantee you that you don't need to have a deep knowledge of the sport. \\n\\n\r\nDiamond no Ace is the only other Baseball anime that I've watched so far and before that and I should say that STILL I have not a very complex idea on how Baseball works. Though I have learnt a fair amount of things. If you seek a mind-bending anime with a sharp-witted and easily likeable character with godly skills, One Outs is definitely worth checking out. If it turns out the way as it did for me, you'll love it for sure.\\n",

            "content": "Pen is mightier than sword, that is what we learn from one outs. From the synopsis one may be confused that Is this baseball? Is this chess? Is this gambling? The answer is Nope its not, its ONE OUTS. Bored of animes with cliche MC, who either suck at everything and gradually develops into a strong character or suddenly gets a powerboost to defeat all his foes, or in the name of friends brings out some kind of hidden power, and stuff, then u r definitely looking for this awesomesauce.\r\nBaseball as a sports isn't popular in my country, as such I dont even know allthe rules of the game. The ongoing anime Diamond no Ace which is also a baseball anime inspired me and got me into the game, and as such I was expecting One Outs to be a similar sports genre anime. But I was gravely mistaken, and had to eat my words, because it was much more than that.\\n\\n\r\nThe best picture of one outs is this-What would happen if someone with IQ 200+ starts pitching in a baseball game? The answer is you get one outs. \"Cool\" \"Awesome\" \"Incredible\" \"Mindblowing\" these mere words are just not enough. \"One outs\" the title of the anime cant exactly bring out its epicness, rather the subtitle fairly does \"nobody wins but I\". The main reason\u00a0 for all this is the additional psychological genre which grills our mind.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and sound 8/10\\n\r\nConsidering this to be a 2009 anime, the animation is pretty decent, but obviously not at the level of present animes. But it is not something which will burn up ur eyes, so this shouldn't be a barrier for watching the anime. As for osts and opening, these were cool, and conveyed the atmosphere in the most appreciable way which fits the genre.\\n\\n\r\nStory 9/10 :\\n\r\nFor the story, it is the most difficult part to explain without spoiling a bit. Almost the whole story revolves around the protagonist tokuchi, and the antagonist the Owner. The biggest defect of the story is that the introduction part was a bit long, other than that it follows a steady pace. So there is a miser owner, who gets into a contract with tokuchi, if tokuchi gets someone out, he gets 5 million yen, but if he gives up a run, he pays 50 million yen. The story is plain and simple he plays against his opponents, thats all. The story is kept interesting by showing us his tentative salary periodically, after each game. That said how the matches take place is quite amusing, and most often viewer will be tempted to say something like brilliant, and may have no words left for what comes next. As such the story mostly develops around the single protagonist tokuchi and how he distinguishes himself with his keen observational skills and high intellect. It conveys that skill is not the only important thing in a game such as baseball. Another aspect of the story is that there is always someone smart in the opponent team and rivals tokuchi.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 8/10\\n\r\nThe only character in focus is tokuchi, all others are sidelined and get less screen time. Apart from tokuchi there is the catcher Ideguchi who mostly serves to display the thought process of a common man, and brings out what is going through tokuchi's mind. Also there is the batter Kojima who plays a similar role, but in a rather sophisticated manner. And ofcourse we are also shown what the opponents are thinking. There is always one smart guy on the opposite team who partially sees through tokuchi's acts but what happens..... u need to watch the anime. Moreover there is the owner, his personal assistant, and chief, and the manager who mostly add to the comedy part. Tbh, this anime doesn't have comedy genre, yet I was forced to laugh on many occasions, especially due to the character's caricature done by the narrator. In fact narrator has done a very good job explaining many things.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed the series fully, tokuchi's character itself is brilliant, his tactics, his mind and his cunning behaviour. It was fun to see how his tricks succeeded, and the reactions of his opponents, and also that of the owner. I laughed a lot, on the incompetent manager, as well as on his teammates. I didn't regret a minute spent on it. \\n\r\nIn the end, I couldnt give it a perfect 10, because it lacked two things. First is something, something which I can't recall, it is a silly thing, yet I can't recollect, Ah! I now remember, this lacks a SEQUEL. To get 10 it really needs a sequel. \\n\\n\r\nRead the next para only if u have watched the series else skip the para.\\n\\n\r\nSecond, and the more important fact is this-- For the first 10 eps we are not shown what is going through tokuchi's mind. But after that we are shown what he is thinking giving us many clues and made it uninteresting. No doubt logic is a must in these kinds of anime, but the explanation were a bit too implicative. As a matter of fact I was able to predict 80% of the story from the clues presented. One may call it a positive factor which because the author states facts in a lucid yet tricky fashion, but on the other hand it may be referred to as a bit of cliche, because if u can predict the outcome the anime become less interesting. Other animes of the similar genre like death note were much more successful because unexpected things happened but in this case most of them are fact driven and if someone pays close attention they can decipher the whole anime. I know it is not a mystery genre, but nonetheless it became bit predictable in the latter half. I like it when the unexpected happens, in fact I expect the unexpected, but this became a bit low in the latter half. Not that it was 100% predictable or something, only a bit predictable. Nonetheless this fact can be easily overlooked and above all it is my personal opinion.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\r\nFinally, this has something which most animes lack, that is its knowledge of scientific facts. The anime lucidly explains psycology, physics, maths and some baseball terms. Many episodes come with a piercing quote from tokuchi, and his perception of winning.\\n\\n\r\nSo it doesnt really matter if u r some avid baseball fan, or simone with no prior knowledge of the sport, because it explains every detail. Moreover the suspense is also cool and it has got some of the best cliffhangers. All in one I would recommend this to anyone looking for a cool anime.",

One Outs is essentially a gambling show revolving around baseball. This would seem boring normally but the production team is apparently able to make even rock-paper-scissors exciting, so baseball can't be too bad. Though a generic sports anime on the surface, it shines in its characters and extremely unique approach to creating suspense. Hell, there's an episode where both teams have to LOSE the game in order to WIN it. It'sonly 11 episodes in so far but it's by far my favorite show this season. Go watch it.",

            "content": "Shit.\r\nI cannot express to you my level of disbelief at the fact that so many people gave this show a rating above 6. This show has to be the most stinking pile of shit I have ever seen in my favourite genre of anime: sports. And I know what people are going to say. \"Oh but dude, this isn't a typical sports anime! You just don't understand baseball! You just don't understand Tokuchi Toua's intelligence!\" This is false. You would have to be a mentally impaired slug to not understand Tokuchi Toua's intelligence after watching this series. In fact, that's basically the only thing thatyou take away from this series, besides a pretty decent OP and ED.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThere are none. No, wait, that's incorrect. There is one. One character. His name is Tokuchi Toua. He is the only person in the whole show. He is the only person in the entire world with a mind that is capable of functioning. Yes that was me exaggerating. But not really. The only reason any other character exists is to highlight Tokuchi Toua's godlike, incomparable intelligence. So let's give the cast a name. I propose, \"Tokuchi Toua and His Bunch of Braindead Bitches.\" Because everyone is his braindead bitch. Not just the players on the team, but the manager, the owner, the players on the other team, and maybe even his parents for all the fuck I know. This wouldn't be as much of a problem if they at least gave us some backstory, some insight into Tokuchi's past that lets us see what made him this way. Anything that shaped his personality. But NO! God forbid we get a backstory on the only character worth caring about! Let's get backstories on characters that disappear after 3 episodes! Like that cheating manager! Or that shitty catcher! You know, they tell us that he's been playing One Outs his whole life, but they don't explain how he knows so fucking much about baseball. I'm just left to assume, but I won't dwell on that because it's not a very big complaint of mine. Hold up, did I mention that Tokuchi Toua is the perfect human being? That he is perfect in every sense of the word and nothing he does is incorrect? Because that's exactly how it seems. At the very beginning they tell us that, \"despite his slow pitches, he still wins because he plays with other people's minds!\" Which is fine, until you realize that he can, indeed, pitch fast. Fast enough to get the fastest baseball runner in the world out. He was hiding that trick all along. No mind games needed here. No weird tactics. Nothing. So yeah TL;DR, Tokuchi Toua is the everything and everybody else is either his bitch, an evil cunt, or both.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMusic:\\n\\n\r\nUsually one of my favourite parts about an anime but fuck. There's nothing here. I like the OP and ED, but besides that all there is is a bunch of bland, forgettable, funk tracks. And some atmospheric stuff I guess. Shit.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nInteresting premise, I'll give it that. It starts off really strong, and basically has me hooked up until about episode 10-12, where I realize that every game they play is the same shit. The same predictable outcomes. I'll admit it is entertaining to watch the process by which Tokuchi arrives to victory, but if you don't know much about baseball and if you don't like sports/psychological anime, then I don't think you would enjoy this anime past the 8 episode mark.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThemes:\\n\\n\r\nNot even the most basic and easy themes to explore are even hinted at in this anime. The theme of teamwork and unity to achieve a certain goal or purpose, the theme of never giving up regardless of how the odds are against you. These are all themes that are prevalent in sports anime, and I'm not saying all anime should follow genre conventions, but if you're going to choose between following a convention and not doing anything at all, I'd usually say go the conventional route. Teamwork can't be explored because they chose to replace characters with the cast of, \"Tokuchi Toua's tools to triumph.\" In case you haven't noticed, I love alliteration.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR don't watch unless you absolutely adore baseball or psychological anime. And even then don't expect much.",

            "content": "One Outs was a baseball manga written by Kaitani Shinobu. It was adapted into an anime by our old friends at Madhouse, who brought us such classics as Black Lagoon, Petshop of Horrors and Rideback. Unfortunately, they've also been behind some of the worst anime I've ever seen such as Highschool of the Dead and Devil Hunter Yohko. I'm honestly not predicting their best work this time around, although a lot of that is more to do with the subject matter than anything else. I am not a person who cares about sports in the slightest. So, let's look at One Outs and see ifit holds up in spite of my own apathy towards the material. \\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nOur story opens with some minor league players at a training camp. After an injury destroys their pitcher's ability to throw balls at a guy with a stick, two of them go on a search for a new one. At this point they get lured to a gambling arena where people bet on whether or not a guy can hit a ball with a stick. The two lose a large amount of money and their friend, Kojima, who has won a bunch of awards with names that are meaningless to me, returns to challenge the pitcher who beat them, Tokuchi. He loses, but returns for a rematch, if he loses he'll retire, if he wins he'll take Tokuchi's hand so that he can never gamble using baseball again. Because a game that requires people to hit a ball with a stick and run in a square is serious business and not some kind of game. \\n\\n\r\nIn spite of a rather serious hand injury, Kojima wins, but instead of inflicting violence to take Tokuchi's hand, he recruits him as a pitcher to help his team, the Lycaons, win the championship. So, the basic plot is that a low ranking team aims for the championship? I haven't seen that plot since... every piece of sports media ever made, I think. To be fair, One Outs isn't typical in its execution. It uses Tokuchi's unusual contract with the game's owner as the primary source of tension instead of whether or not the team will win the big game. It also puts the focus, not on whether or not the Lycaons will win since basic pattern recognition gives it away, but on how they're going to win. Which is more interesting than it sounds since Tokuchi uses a lot of psychological manipulation and has to think of ways to outsmart his opponents while thwarting the owner's attempts to sabotage him. \\n\\n\r\nThe strategic aspects are pretty well handled in this anime, in spite of the rather trite plot. The series is also good at keeping the viewer's attention with various new elements and twists as well. However, the story telling isn't perfect. The biggest problem is the narrator. His entire job seems to be to give exposition. Which isn't so bad when it's used as a tool to skip through the boring bits, but it's also pretty unnecessary. You could cut out the dialogue for almost all of these scenes and lose nothing. There's also the issue of the plot itself. Even if the execution is unique, just about everyone knows exactly where it's going to go which does limit how much tension the series can have. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of One Outs are mixed. Tokuchi is a pretty interesting \u201cmagnificent bastard\u201d type of character. The Lycaons' owner makes for a compelling antagonist as well. Ideguchi and Kojima are  two-dimensional characters. They get some personality and develop a bit, but not a whole lot. The rest of the characters are pretty one-note. They're around and you might remember their names, but there isn't anything that really makes them unique or compelling. They're just \u201cthat guy who runs fast\u201d or \u201cthat guy with glasses.\u201d \\n\\n\r\nOne thing of note is that a lot of the antagonistic teams that Tokuchi and the Lycaons have to face are shown to have foreigners as their big guns. I'm not sure whether it's a demonstration of Xenophobia in which the great all-Japanese team has to face off against those foreign players who came from some unspecified location or it's just a coincidence. That being said, they do make it a point to bring the foreign players to the viewer's attention so the former seems more likely. \\n\\n\r\nArt:  \\n\\n\r\nThe art is pretty good, overall. The character designs are distinctive. The backgrounds are nicely detailed as well. That being said, there are some questionable art decisions. There are some ridiculously exaggerated expressions. For example, a \u201cshocked\u201d character might just open their mouth so wide they could fit their own head in there. Tokuchi also has an absurd hairstyle that makes him look like he's gone half super saiyan. I know, an anime with silly hair what an original concept. \\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\\n\r\nThe acting in this is okay. It doesn't stand out in any way, but it's passable. The music is really effective when it comes to atmosphere. The tense moments have a score that perfectly emphasises the tension as do the victorious moments. \\n\\n\r\nHo-Yay:\\n\\n\r\nThere is none in this series. 1/10.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts: \\n\\n\r\nIn some ways, One Outs is a typical piece of sports media. Underdog team pushing for victory. In others, it's not at all typical. The battle of wits aspect works pretty effectively and the main protagonist is an interesting character, even if most of the side characters are really flat. Still, it has quite a bit of intrigue and I do recommend checking it out for the battle of wits, if you don't mind watching grown men act like hitting a ball with a stick is a pastime of dire importance or a predictable plot arc. Final rating, 6/10. Next week I'll look at Shining Tears x Wind.",

            "content": "\u201cWinning is about trampling over corpses\u2026 It's not something beautiful. It's brutal. If you want to make it to the top- Steel yourselves.\u201d\r\nI'll admit I may be one of the only sports fans who doesn't care for baseball. Knowing this, the mention of a baseball-centered anime \u201cOne Outs\u201d did anything but grab my attention. However, through many friend recommendations and some quoted similarities to the suspenseful Kaiji series, I was ultimately drawn to it. Does it live up to its ranking inside the top 150 rated anime on all of MAL, or does it drown in its own hype?\r\nThe first thing I noticed about OneOuts is that it was produced by Madhouse, one of my all time favorite anime studios. The 2000\u2019s were some of their best years, so it's unfortunate but understandable that shows like this and RAINBOW were overlooked by the masses. We are introduced to the series with a description of the prestige regarding one of Japan\u2019s greatest baseball players, Hiromichi Kojima.  While training for the upcoming season, Kojima uncovers an underground gambling game infamously labeled \u201cOne Outs\u201d, betting a single pitcher against a respective batter. It is here that Kojima meets the smug-faced Tokuchi Toua and his illustrious baseball career is transformed forever.\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't say there's much there as far as story is concerned. There's more or less 4 mini-excerpts involving Tokuchi\u2019s introduction, and 3 game series between the Lycaon\u2019s (Tokuchi\u2019s team) and other teams in the Japanese minor league. In each of the mini-arcs, Tokuchi\u2019s mental prowess is showcased as he seeks to outwit the opposing team almost entirely by himself. There's one catch though. As a pitcher, Tokuchi is bound to a secretive contract developed by the owner of the Lycaons. Each out he gets earns him 5 million yen, while each run scored while he's on the mound costs him 50. Is his intellect and swagger enough to keep him afloat? With all the sinister tactics and tricks up his opponent\u2019s sleeves, One Outs lets a simple sport like baseball transcend into a chess match between the minds.\\n\\n\r\nTokuchi as a protagonist is undeniably refreshing, as he breaks the mold in almost every way possible. He's cutthroat, appears to not give a shit 90% of the time and is leagues above his competition in intelligence. The best part is the stark level of confidence he displays at every waking turn. Effortlessly outsmarting his foes into a stupor of shame and disbelief. He's living by the catchphrase of the anime: \u201cNobody wins but I!\u201d Tokuchi\u2019s focus on winning isn't always overtly expressed. I can't begin to mention the amount of times where he appeared lackadaisical, while the whole time plotting the enemy\u2019s demise. For fans of Kaiji\u2019s character, Tokuchi is almost a polar opposite archetype. To be honest, the two anime are almost completely different in terms of their approach to winning, but both somehow achieve a similar level of suspense that keeps you constantly pressing the button for the next episode.\\n\\n\r\nAs outlandish and unpredictable as Tokuchi\u2019s schemes sometimes appeared, I never had the thought \u201cthere\u2019s no way that would work!\u201d Every strategy fabricated in the anime has a sense of plausibility in it. Unfortunately, the repeated successes Tokuchi reaped only highlighted how dumb everyone else on his team was. There were countless instances where Tokuchi even exploited it by not coming forward with his plan and instead called everyone an idiot. It's like the writers were saying, \u201clook at dumb the Lycaon\u2019s are, but look at how smart Tokuchi is!\u201d I mean, even the blind mouse finds the cheese every once in awhile. At least toward the end of the series, Kojima and even the catcher Ideguchi began to sign on to Tokuchi\u2019s way of thinking. I would argue that almost every other character on the show is irrelevant because of how character driven the anime appears to be. Tokuchi Toua makes or breaks the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe only disappointing factor for me in One Outs was the lack of \u201chigh stakes\u201d mind games. Unlike Kaiji where literally every game is life and death, this anime only encompassed a few series of baseball games during the regular season. Even the curveballs (pun intended) the owner tries to throw our protagonist\u2019s way are easily thwarted without any real sense of urgency on his behalf. I would've rather seen the mind games take place in the playoffs or for a more \u201clife-threatening\u201d cause. In the end, the sheer amount of aha! moments and badass Tokuchi escapades made One Outs quite worthwhile. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation isn't the most flashy thing you'll see out of Madhouse, but given it\u2019s almost 10 years old at this point, it holds up decent enough. The character models aren't my favorite, but the artists did a fine job making each one distinguishable enough from the next, given this is a sports anime where there's a large cast and plenty of room to blend some faces together. The action animation was also quite detailed. Whether through the illustration of the American runner Johnson\u2019s spellbinding speed, or the dark moments when Tokuchi was dissecting his opponent\u2019s brain, I was entertained by the animation throughout. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP isn't one to remember. Nothing like the soothing, grainy cliche 2000\u2019s rock singer voice against the backdrop of our main protagonist shirtless and posing for the camera. Lol, wtf? I prefer when either the song matches the ambience or the theme of the show, and not some mishmash of genres just to appease certain demographics. At least that hair raising Deadman Wonderland OP actually tied into the anime somewhat. The ED is much more fitting, though nothing noteworthy enough to play through each episode. The background music is simplistic but effective. I actually liked the flow of the music into each scene as well. Masoto Hagiwara has a brilliant performance as Tokuchi, cementing him as one of my personal favorite voice actors.\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned before, I thoroughly enjoyed One Outs, and I would rank it up as a pleasant surprise in the medium. It's certainly not talked about as much as it should be, given its similarities to Kaiji and the fact that it's a sports anime. However, unlike other sports anime such as Haikyuu or Ping Pong, One Outs focuses almost solely on one character. If you don't care for Tokuchi\u2019s arrogance or conceited nature, One Outs may not be the anime for you. If you like a main protagonist out of the norm, and an intellectual game of tricks and twists, then I give it the fullest of recommendations. As always, thanks for reading and be sure to check out my other reviews!\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL- 7.5",

            "content": "\"Winning a game is not dependent on surpassing your opponents with your strength or waiting for lucky breaks. Conquer the opponent, crushing them, and stepping over the fallen ones ruthlessly. Winning means dominating over countless dead bodies.\"\r\nOne Outs, I admit, was never on my radar. It only recently caught my attention when I found out that Hagiwara Masato, known for voicing Kaiji Itou (a dumb gambler with a crazy lucky streak and serious cunning known for crazy come-from-behind victories), and Akagi Shigiru (an insane gambler with a crazy lucky streak and serious cunning known for crazy come-from-behind victories), would be voicing Tokuchi Towa, a pitchinggambler with a crazy lucky streak and serious cunning, known for crazy come-from-behind victories.\\n\\n\r\nIf I sound like I am mocking it, don't be fooled. One Outs provided for some seriously gripping drama that kept me from going to bed at decent hours, much like \"Kaiji\" and \"Akagi\" before it. Animated by Madhouse but not adapted from a manga by Nobuyuki Fukumoto, Madhouse took the lessons it learned from animating both \"Akagi\" and \"Kaiji\" Season One to put out an incredibly solid thriller that stands out as a great introduction to the manga series, and to psychological seinen gambling series. \\n\\n\r\n(Note: I will be making comparisons to both \"Akagi\" and \"Kaiji,\" mostly due to the similarities in theme, storytelling, and because Madhouse and Hagiwara Masato were both involved. No spoilers for either of those series to follow, and this review will cover the basic storyline without getting into the major twists.)\\n\\n\r\nStory - 8\\n\\n\r\nThe story is about a baseball team. The Lyacons are a team much like the Red Sox (before their awesome win in 2004), a losing team with a highly devoted fan base. The manager is a complete asshole, one who really doesn't care about if the team wins or loses, but if they can turn a profit with filling the seats. Kojima, the star player, goes to Okinawa for training, where he meets a mysterious pitcher who makes bets with people in a game called \"One Outs,\" a pitcher vs batter duel in which the pitcher must strike out the batter. Tokuchi, who had won 499 bets beforehand, barely loses to Kojima, in which Kojima gambled his retirement against Tokuchi's pitching hand, and is signed onto the Lyacons under a unique \"One Outs\" contract. \\n\\n\r\nThrow an out, earn 5 Million Yen. Let a runner score, lose 50 million. \\n\\n\r\nWhat follows are the first few games of the Lyacon's baseball season, with the typical arcs going in a pattern of learning about the opposing team, how high the stakes have been raised for Tokuchi, what crazy tricks the opposing team has to their advantage, and then Tokuchi systematically breaking down every single opponent that even tries to match his cunning. This is the basic story arc from \"Akagi\" (and Kaiji to a certain extent). If you're not ready for it, you might get sick of how many gosh dang times people underestimate Tokuchi and his planning, and how he basically not only saw through your plan but is actively undermining it AND turning it against you. It can get annoying, but part of the appeal is watching a genius like Tokuchi actually planning and counteracting seemingly clever plans while generally acting like a bored asshole (more on his character in a bit). This isn't to say the story is predictable: it's just that some might be turned off by what can sometimes feel like deceptive tension for the sake of tension. \\n\\n\r\nRegardless, even if you're not into baseball, the show more or less using baseball as the framing device for what are basically one-on-one duels of cunning and wits. You don't need to know a lot about baseball: just knowing the basic rules will help you get the most out of the show. It has a snappy pace that gives it the \"just one more episode\" feeling to every ending. The pacing is slow, for sure, but deliberately so. No episodes ever feel too long or short, with each story arc resolving nicely and carrying into the next one. The story ends around the end of the manga's first major story arc, and I can imagine the rest of the manga plays out much like the events that preceeded it. But thankfully, One Outs ends on a clean note; something that plagues \"Kaiji\" Season 1 and \"Akagi\" (Madhouse definitely took this lesson to heart for the end of \"Kaiji\" Season 2). \\n\\n\r\n(Note - Yes, I know it's not Madhouse's fault for the ending of \"Akagi.\" The duel with Washizu has been going on for 10 years. I went to a convenience store recently and saw the new chapter, and it doesn't look any closer to ending. Kubo Tite WISHES he could stretch out a manga like that.)\\n\\n\r\nThe drama works very well, and it is those intense psychological battles that carry the story through to the end. The drama, the dialogue, and the intense reactions to the events of the story work very well. The issue, I find, is when the story tries to be \"funny.\" While Kaiji and Akagi were occasionally sprinkled with bits of dark humor, it mainly kept the tension wound tighter then the seams on a baseball. \"One Outs'\" problem is with the material it is adapting: the moments of humor, be it the goofy reactions from the players or the visual metaphor of the manager being a dog is inconsistent with the themes and tone that One Outs tries to achieve. Nothing wrong with the occasional joke, but when a super serious moment has a moment of goofiness just kinda thrown in, the dissonance is really hard to ignore. Shows like \"One Outs,\" \"Kaiji,\" and \"Akagi\" are at their very best when it has a deep look into the hearts and minds of the key players in games of insane chance, skill, and wits. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, the bits of humor don't detract from the overall story. I can even see \"One Outs\" as being a great introduction to the style of storytelling present in \"Akagi\" and \"Kaiji,\" while not being as deathly serious. Plus, baseball fans are going to get a nice kick at all the care and attention that goes into dissecting and understanding the complexities of baseball, without getting in the way of the main plot threads spun by the devilishly clever Tokuchi. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 6\\n\\n\r\nThe art is my second-least favorite part about the series. They did a good job adapting the manga's look and style, but it doesn't help that the manga's style is not that great to begin with. It's just odd to see main characters with really strong, sharp lines and great design being placed next to characters that are outright comical. As I mentioned in the story, the dissonance is hard to ignore. \\n\\n\r\nTokuchi is the best designed character of the bunch, animating fluidly and really carrying the emotions and attitudes that come from a guy like him. While he may be stoic, even the most stoic of characters have traces of emotion, and Madhouse did a great job with him in general. The other character that make up the supporting cast work well along side of Tokuchi. While they are more \"normal\" looking, it helps make Tokuchi stand out more, which is a good thing (Bonus points to Madhouse for giving Tokuchi a long nose, much like the heroes in many of Nobuyuki Fukumoto's works). Tokuchi is a very weird, mysterious guy that you can't help but notice, even in a crowd; and the art design carries this well. Characters like Kojima and Ideguchi help complete the contrast: Tokuchi is a thin, stoic, and sharp mouthed punk. Ideguchi is an emotional, stout catcher who wears his heart on his sleeve, and Kojima is a serious minded and broad, imposing man who is still approachable and humble. Madhouse clearly put a lot of thought into this dynamic, and it works out well. The three take up the most screen time, and the animation helps carry out these character moments when they are not talking. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the other characters, they don't get the same love. Many of the faces on the Lyacon's team are bland, and comical in comparison. It's ultimately kind-of-distracting, as their faces enter the frame, and instead of remembering them when they leave it, you end up annoyed because they took away valuable face time from the three main characters. There are good details on Tokuchi's opponents, but not many stand out. But with some of the antagonists, they're designed well enough to carry the idea that these are the kind of people who would go against Tokuchi in a battle of some kind. \\n\\n\r\nBackgrounds are the weakest part. Most of the action takes place in baseball diamonds, and Madhouse fell flat in this regard. While there are moments of intense action that work really well, they really don't capture the full excitement of a baseball game. They use strong visual metaphors, but they're not as clever or well defined as the ingenious metaphors found within \"Kaiji\" or \"Akagi.\" One would think that all that time spent animating \"Hajime No Ippo\" would give Madhouse some ideas on how to make baseball, which is typically seen as a dreadfully boring sport to watch (never watch baseball on TV if it's not a Tournament game) into a heart-pounding battle of wills. Ultimately, it simply only works some of the time, and is merely the plate in which the meal is delivered on, not being as finely crafted as the other elements.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 5\\n\\n\r\nSound was... ok. The ED is forgivable, and OP is just better off skipped. Granted, considering how perfect \"Kaiji\" Season 2's opening was, I might be the wrong person to ask.\\n\\n\r\nBackground music did it's job without standing out. The show has wonderfully exciting moments, and has appropriate background music when needed, but other then Tokuchi's theme, no track really stands out. Madhouse did amazing work with \"Akagi\" and \"Kaiji\" in terms of OST; a forgettable soundtrack is a sin. \\n\\n\r\nIt's not bad, it's not great. It's like a part-time worker: just punches in and punches out without making an impression. It's a damn shame, too. Music is what makes shows like these so gripping and exciting, and they just did an average job. \\n\\n\r\nAt this point I've been railing against the show really heavilly. But the next part is what makes the whole thing worth it. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter/Voice Acting - 9\\n\\n\r\nI have no idea what it is about Hagiwara Masato, but the people who make important decisions at Madhouse have figured out that by giving this guy an insane gambler to voice, he will nail it so perfectly it will give you chills. It's one thing to be a one trick pony, but this pony can do a really freaking good trick. Masato captures the essence of this character perfectly, with a deceptively monotone voice that is filled with the cunning of a demon behind every syllable. He's assure of himself that seems like arrogance to people who don't understand him. He's a punk who plays the fool so well that his deception will trap you before you even realize what is going on. And when he delivers lines about putting your life into a game, or when he's says that he will take out the next batter in 3 pitches, it pierces you like an untarnished blade that looks like it has not drawn blood until the very last moment. \\n\\n\r\nHe's really good, that's what I am saying. While Akagi was a genius who seemed bored all the time (And Kaiji was just in a league all of his own), this character is one of a troubled man. A guy who knows he is smart, and feels like he is a giant among men. But the difference here is that once he gets with the Lyacon's, you get the idea that he genuinely cares about people other then himself. While he is motivate by money and thrills, he wants to make others better. He gives encouragement, gives credit for his ideas to others, and all-in-all seems like a guy who really wants to have this team win. Tokuchi feels like a more likeable version of Akagi, in which he teaches harsh lessons to improve others. Then he crushes his opponents like a man who can only feel pleasure in overcoming insane odds, and then rubbing salt in the wound. The quote at the top captures his mentality perfectly, and Masato's voice acting carries it beautifully. While many of the other characters might be one note, he manages to conduct a symphony and uses every single limited note to create a wonderful character piece into the mind of a man who lives on the very edges of luck and skill. \\n\\n\r\nJust listen to Tokuchi. The other voice actors turn in great performances, but it's all Masato's show. So with the voice acting, character arc, and story, it all hinges on how much you like this guy's voice. He's a great voice actor, and his strength carries the show to new heights. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall - 8\\n\\n\r\nI marathoned \"Kaiji\" Seasons 1 and 2 in about the span of 2 weeks or so. I went through \"Akagi\" in a few days. Likewise, \"One Outs\" came and went quick, but was still a great ride. I was seriously pumping my fist by the end, and the tension often kept me from getting a decent night sleep before work. \"One Outs\" is a lot like the title character: Singularly minded; but extremely brilliant at it's one talent. The art and music may not do much, but the well told drama along with with great voicework puts \"One Outs\" over the top, and rarely strikes out. \\n\\n\r\n4 out of 5.",

            "content": "This anime was partially enjoyable, but my enjoyment was mostly overshadowed by what I see as failed potential. One Outs starts out with a world of potential with the interesting and enigmatic main character, genius pitcher Tokuchi Toua. The supporting characters are interesting as well and immediately given impressive backstory and development. The atmosphere seemed to be setting up for a great baseball journey and even the narrator promised that great unforeseen events would happen later on. However, after the first few introductory episodes the series levels out and becomes uninteresting focusing on one long match after another. Many people say this series is likeDeath Note with baseball. It is NOT like Death Note with baseball. There is a distinct lack of arch rivalry, but an abundance of Toua\u2019s god mode. The series disappointed me because 1)Toua\u2019s character never grows, changes, or gets a backstory, and 2) The matches got boring once I realized that they all followed one pattern: \\n\\n\r\nOpponents: \u201cShenanigans! Let\u2019s use dirty tricks, genius, mind games, cheating, and/or raw talent to try and make Toua lose!\u201d \\n\r\nToua : \u201cHaha, nice try but I\u2019m god\u201d Toua then proceeds to own everyone. \\n\\n\r\nThis in and of itself is already an insult to the viewer, but it was made worse by making the matches long and trying to delude us into believing that Toua was actually taking risks and gambling, even though he was pretty much perfect. I\u2019m ok with Gary Stu\u2019s as long as the show is interesting and suspenseful, but unfortunately for me this show was boring. My breakdown will go into a little more detail about the qualities I liked and disliked in this series. There were some aspects I liked, but ultimately this was a frustrating watching experience.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\nThe series started off with great potential and a very interesting main character, but eventually plateaued. The plot doesn\u2019t go very far and many episodes were spent on a single game. Over-emphasis on tricks, sneaky strategies and mind screwing. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nTokuchi Toua was always god-mode mind reading, always right, and always confident. We never get much depth into his charcter, thoughts or background. I like overpowered characters, but only if they come with a background, and at least the illusion of having struggles and growth. These things make it easier for the viewer to root for the character.  Toua doesn\u2019t seem to grow or learn anything. He\u2019s just teaching and showing everybody else. He has an other-wordly quality to him that I really like. But in an anime like this where everything else and everyone else is realistic, it only contributed to the disconnect I felt with the show and with Toua. Toua\u2019s teammates were mostly stupid and incapable and had to rely on Toua. Opponents had a monster-of-the-week feel to them.\\n\\n\r\nOne the show\u2019s main villains, the team\u2019s owner, was another major weakness. Tokuchi spent much of his time and effort just trying to defeat him. Why did the owner have to be the main foil?  It was annoying, and a great hindrance to the plot and the story\u2019s development. It was as if he (Tokuchi) was stuck in a permanent holding pattern fighting against the boss. \\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound\\n\r\nThe animation was pretty good, and the music was just okay. Not bad, but forgettable. Overall, the voice acting was good, but I think that Toua\u2019s VA was miscast.\\n\\n\r\nThe Bottom Line: While the show was by no means terrible and had some enjoyable moments it ultimately let me down, and I feel like watching this wasn\u2019t worth my time. I\u2019d discourage others from viewing this as well. There are many other psychological and sports shows out there that are better than this.\\n",

            "content": "Hands down my favorite anime.  I've rewatched it twice and if it were possible to erase my memories of what happens in this anime, I would likely rewatch it many more times.  Now, without further ado...\r\n[Story: 10]\r\nThe story revolves around a man named Toua Tokuchi, whose background is effectively unknown.  All we know is that he excels in a form of gambling through baseball called \"One Outs.\"  This seems to be a theme in madhouse animes, such as Kaiji and Akagi, where the character's past remains a mystery and unknown throughout the story.  Anyways, Toua is finally defeated in OneOuts by a man nicknamed the \"unlucky prodigy batter\" Hiromichi Kojima, and due to the stakes of the gamble, Toua leaves the gambling world to lend his prowess to the weakest team in the Japanese Pacific League: the Saitama Lycaons.  I won't post any spoilers, but basically the story from here on out is Toua's \"conquests\" of one team after another, using his sharp wit and gambling instincts to overcome star players, intelligent strategists, and even cheating on the opposing team's part to emerge victorious all while making a pretty penny off his special \"One Outs\" contract.  A great addition is the current tally of Toua's salary due to the contract at the end of every few episodes and by near the end of the series, that number is scary huge.\\n\\n\r\n[Art: 9]\\n\r\nNot outstanding but gets the job done.  The way every character is drawn beautifully reflects their personality (i.e. Toua looks almost sinister at times) and as such really enhances the cinematic effect of the anime.  It is also fairly realistic, unlike the weird style used in Kaiji and Akagi (although I found that style appropriate for those animes).  Since, the story and character are so great, however, I'm not giving art much weight toward the final rating.\\n\\n\r\n[Sound: 8]\\n\r\nOP and ED are decent (nothing special) and sound effects are accurate and well-executed.  BGM is fairly limited but it does a good job setting the right mood.  Like art, it's pretty overshadowed by the story and as such won't factor much into the final rating.\\n\\n\r\n[Character: 10]\\n\r\nThere are several \"round\" characters in the anime (characters that develop in terms of character and maturity), though surpirsingly one of them is not the protagonist (Toua Tokuchi).  I'm referring to the Lycaons team as a whole.  Throughout the course of the anime, they change for the better.  But Toua, the protagonist, does not.  So then, why do I still award a 10 for character?  The answer is that Toua's character still works beautifully.  He remains the cool, calculating, canniving SOB from begininning to end and while this personality doesn't change within him, it changes his teammates for the better.  Through watching him win games with his cunning, you will see the Lycaons as a whole evolve from a downtrodden team that's last in the pennant race to one that is much more positive and has a better outlook on things by the end of the series.  So what's amazing is not Toua's ability to change and become a better man himself, but rather his undeniable ability to lead and change every man on his team.\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment: 10]\\n\r\nAfter everything I've said before, the 10 I awarded in enjoyment should be self-explanatory.  If you don't care for baseball, or even dislike baseball, but have an appreciation of strategy and psychology among other things, I think this anime will still blow your socks off.  This anime is easily addicting enough to make you want to watch the whole thing in one eight hour sitting.\\n\\n\r\n[Overall: 10]\\n\r\nAn outstanding anime and my favorite overall.  Death Note, Code Geass and a number of other greats don't even come close to this in my book, although I enjoyed them very much.",

            "content": "*Note* This is my first review, so any feedback on how I can make it better/more useful to the reader is greatly appreciated :), thanks in advance.\r\nAt first glance, One Outs may seem to be based around baseball, but that's merely the medium used to deliver the psychological warfare that is entailed within this anime.\r\nStory (9/10):\r\nThe story is revolved around a pitcher named Tokuchi Toua (who has had no previous 'official' experience as a professional baseball playe) and how he 'joins' the Lycoans to help them increase their ranking. \r\nThe story in itself is nothing special, but there are 2 aspects to this anime thatmake it interesting:\\n\\n\r\nFirstly, Tokuchi's pitching is actually pretty average, even arguably below the standard of a professional baseball player. However, it's not his pitch that is his weapon, but rather his genius mind that he uses in order to out-wit his opponents.\\n\\n\r\nSecondly, Tokuchi's contract is not that of your average baseball player, he gains 5,000,000 yen for every person he strikes out but loses 50,000,000 yen for every run scored while he is on the mound.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7/10):\\n\r\nThe art was nothing spectacular but wasn't an eye-sore either. It did it's job.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10):\\n\r\nThe voice acting was well done, each voice suited it's character - especially Tokuchi's. The way the actor speaks as Tokuchi is a perfect reflection on how Tokuchi is portrayed through his actions. The music used did it's job and enhanced the experience, but the soundtracks used aren't really what you'd listen to outside of watching anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7/10):\\n\r\nThe characters you get are the characters you expect, Tokuchi is a calm and calculating genius while the others are just your average baseball player. One Outs only really focuses on a handful of people while the others are just hurdles to overcome or a tool to be used.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10):\\n\r\nOne outs doesn't get boring, it's not one of those shows where material is just reused and recycled. Each match played is unique to itself and the way Tokuchi manages to deal with every 'impossible' scenario never fails to impress eiether. There are also elements of comedy mixed in here and there aswell.\\n\\n\r\nAs a conclusion, i'll say that i rated One Outs as a 10/10 for it's entertaining set-up. The show also requires no prior experience in baseball to understand what's going on, making it an easy watch for all anime lovers world wide.",

            "content": "I don't really watch sport anime since this is not genre I enjoy but this is actually a gambling anime in disguise as sport anime. The anime has it pros and cons:\r\nThe Good\r\n1. Mind game\r\nThe mind game and the plot twist is not as thrilling as Death Note, Liar Game or any other mind game anime/manga but it is still enjoyable to watch.\r\n2. Gambling anime disguise as sport anime\r\nThis is something we don't see quite often so this is actually quite unique because it felt new. Not to mention, it can easily attract people who is not interest in sport anime. So, for people whonever watch sport anime or never interested in sport anime, this will be their first sport anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe Bad\\n\r\n1. Art style\\n\r\nWeird and uninteresting art style. Especially the main protagonist looks like blond hair Hisoka from Hunter x Hunter.\\n\\n\r\n2. OST\\n\r\nThe ost is not really that nice or memorable.\\n\\n\r\n3. Gambling anime disguise as sport anime\\n\r\nThis depend on people actually. If the people who is like me, not really interested in sport anime, this is the anime where we will find quite enjoyable and new but for those who is into sport anime, might be a little disappointed since this anime aren't typically baseball anime they used to watch unless they are ok with psychological genre (of course, don't expect the mind game to be better than other psychological anime have watch before)\\n\\n\r\n4. Baseball\\n\r\nI know nothing about baseball so sometime when they explain the rule of baseball really confuse me and not to mention, they mix it with mind game which sometimes make me more confuse. It would be appreciate if they do what Death Note does. In Death Note, in the middle of every episode (aka commercial break) there is \"How to use Death Note\" rule explanation so we anime watcher can pause the video and read the rule and when we understand the rule a little, we can get what is going on with the story.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nDespite its cons, the anime is still enjoyable however, if you are watching this anime because of baseball, then I suggest it's best you skip this because it is not the same baseball anime you used to watch before unless you are ok with psychology genre but do not expect the mind game is as good as other psychology anime because the plot twist is not really that strong. This anime is worth to watch when you don't have good anime to watch this season because it's still an enjoyable anime to past your time.",

            "content": "All hail the almighty Tokuchi Toua: A man of many strengths and no flaws. For many this can be an appealing trait for a lead character, but for me it was an eventual cause for boredom in what was supposed to be a high stakes drama.\r\nOne Outs did begin on a strong note, introducing a gambling spin on a national pastime with the odds heavily stacked against an enigmatic character, but over time it became increasingly apparent that no one would challenge Tokuchi. He gets whatever he wants, when he wants, however he wants it, and never shows any shred of vulnerability. One Outs ismost often compared to Kaiji the Ultimate Survivor, but in that show the main character is is the very opposite of invincible. He loses. A lot, and pays a major price as a result. We even learn about his life in the very first episode, and there are a wide variety of games played as opposed to just baseball with a cheating spin. \\n\\n\r\nOne Punch Man offers a similar divide in the talents of a lead and everyone else, but that's the literal joke constantly being played for laughs while being complimented by god tier animation and actual good supporting characters. One Outs offers none of this. It's often ugly to look at with no memorable character aside from the lead. Kojima was poised to be a rival of Tokuchi's and a supposed budding superstar in the baseball world, but he is practically invisible in actual matches presumably to show just how helpless the team is without their savior Tokuchi Christ.\\n\\n\r\nDespite its aforementioned flaws, One Outs is not a bad anime. The actual strategy executed by Tokuchi is interesting especially in the end where it reaches a fever pitch. The OST's are memorable tracks that I'll be playing on long commutes for the foreseeable future. Tokuchi may be an one dimensional overpowered god, but he is a cool character with a level of intellect on par with the greatest minds in anime. One Outs does a lot well, but the things I'd expect to be most impressed with I instead left dissatisfied. Does not help that the anime doesn't cover the full story, and stops short of the Lycanons season truly beginning.\\n\\n\r\nI understand why this anime is well regarded within the community, but for me it did not live up to its reputation and is closer to mediocre than a masterpiece of any sort.",

            "content": "this isn't really a sports anime, despite using baseball as a vehicle, and it isn't really a gambling show either, despite the lead character Tokuchi being an inveterate gambler.  it is primarily a sort of mystery -- i got the most out of trying to figure out what Tokuchi was thinking, and how he would foil his enemies.\r\nthe premise of the story is unique and interesting, and i enjoyed the progression of a lengthy set of episodes each showing Tokuchi being pitted against various nefarious villains.  mind, i didn't enjoy the villains, they were all one-note characters, bad guys through and through, constantlyoveracting, and therefore boring.  but the way Tokuchi outthinks them is very entertaining.  it would be even better if one could actually follow through all the complex twists and turns, but alas the writing doesn't allow for that much of the time.  the pacing was overall good, except for the cliffhangers which sometimes seemed very artificial -- but if you marathon the show they won't bother you.\\n\\n\r\ni love the art.  the character design is excellent at conveying the traits of each character -- Tokuchi is all sharp angles and planes, Kojima looks solid, honest, reliable, Ideguchi is wide-eyed naivete, the coach all large flapping lips.  Even tertiary characters are all unique.  the background art is generally good with detail, and sometimes is astonishingly beautiful in its play with light.  alas the animation is mediocre; too often speed lines replace actual movement.\\n\\n\r\nthe voice acting is nothing special, a few seiyuu i especially like had supporting roles, but they didn't stand out.  it's always difficult for me to judge voice actors when the role calls for a character who is overacted by design, since i can't stand overacting, it's a bad mark against the seiyuu either way.  Tokuchi is voiced by Hagiwara Masato (Akagi, Kaiji -- oh look, a theme!), with whom i am not terribly familiar; Tokuchi is very controlled, almost speaks with a  monotone.  BGM is good and fits the story.  the OP grated on my nerves; the singer sounded like he was having problems with his bowel movement, though the music itself wasn't all bad. there's a bit of fanservice in the opening for those who like naked men (i'm all for that, but Tokuchi doesn't really turn my crank).  the ED... umm.  you know, i have already forgotten it.\\n\\n\r\nthe characters are what is most responsible for my low score.  basically only Tokuchi is worth mentioning, and he is very smart, albeit not likeable, and he doesn't develop at all.  there is the thinnest of backstories for him, and for Kojima.  as already mentioned, we have one-note villains, and their motivations are simplistic.  Tokuchi's team mates are largely too stupid to believe, we have no story on them and they don't grow/change.  all that beautiful character design wasted on total zeroes when it comes to personality.\\n\\n\r\nis it worth watching?  for me it was; i enjoyed trying to puzzle out the ways in which Tokuchi would outfox his enemies.  i learned a small bit of math i had previously been unaware of.  i'll probably rewatch it just to think through the puzzling parts again.  if you need your story to make sense, this isn't for you -- it is utterly implausible that anything like this could happen, though i guess it's more likely than giant robots fighting it out with swords.  if you're looking for decent baseball action, don't look here, though there are a couple good bits on strategy, and it does help if you know baseball.  i don't think this has any historical value; it won't become a classic.  it did suck me in and kept me watching, and i'll remember it, but it's not sufficiently good for me to buy it.\\n\\n\r\nthe score i gave seems low, but i just started using a new, more finely grained scoring system, and i think i'll have to lower many of my scores.  what sunk this show to a 6 is the lack of character personality and development, and the lazy animation.\\n",

            "content": "One Outs is a very positive surprise and another hidden gem that has not received as much spotlight as it deserves. I was initially very skeptical about watching this series as I am not very familiar with Baseball. However, the full-of-suspense story and the mentally strong protagonist are extremely captivating.\r\nMost sports anime stories focus on physical prowess of players, their talent and the built-up of a character before he becomes the big star. One Outs is very different in that regards. It focuses entirely on mind games, psychology manipulation, strategy, tactics, gambling, cheating and deception to achieve one's goal. It is about using your brainand all means at your disposal to win the psychological warfare rather than magically overcoming everything with sheer strength and strong resolve.\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist reminds a lot of mentally strong characters and tacticians such as L from Death Note or Lelouch from Code Geass. The story has a good pace with a lot of anxious anticipation of how the main character will overcome the challenges presented to him. It is realistic and provides some valuable lessons to the watcher about the importance of having strong mentality and unwavering psychology, be it in sports or in other spectra of real life. The series does not go into depth explaining everything about Baseball but it still clarifies the important bits. The animation and character design is good. The music is decent, not very memorable since it is all about mind games and not about aesthetically epic moments complimented by music. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, it is a great series and a very enjoyable watch. If you are a fan of strong and dominant protagonists, mind games, gambling and psychological warfare, do not miss this one!",

            "content": "One Outs was an overall enjoyable series that was definitely worth the watch. It contained an interesting and rather original premise, and captured my attention from the early episodes. However, it was not without it's flaws.\r\nStory 8/10: \r\nThe general concept of the show was great. It was original, enjoyable and entertaining. But there were some aspects of the writing that became somewhat repetitive about halfway through the series. It adopted a \"Villain of the week\" sort of approach, where each baseball team had some sort of unstoppable player that had to be taken out. There was also no sense of what happens outside of thestadium, and while I know that the series' main purpose is to showcase the psychology of baseball games, it would have been nice to see some of the world that the characters were living in. \\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10:\\n\r\nStandard quality Madhouse animation. A bit basic, but no major flaws or anything. Nothing really much to say, as it is Madhouse.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10:\\n\r\nI loved the OST of this series. Everything fit the scene perfectly, whether there was supposed to be tension, conflict, or just happy times, the music that accompanied the scene was spot on. The opening song as well was really good, something I would listen to for leisure. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10:\\n\r\nTo me, this is where the series falls a bit short. Don't get me wrong, while the characters were good, entertaining to watch, and made me care about them, they were not as fleshed out as they could be. For instance, we never even find out Tokuchi's back story, and how he became the Japanese DemiGod of baseball. And while I know that the anime only contains half what the original source material did, and that it may not be it's fault due to lack of run time, it still is a detriment to what could have been some of the most interesting characters (Tokuchi in particular) for this sort of genre.\\n\\n\r\nDespite it lacking in certain areas, One Outs really is a fantastic show, that is worthwhile and entertaining. If you liked the psychological mind games of Death Note and Kaiji, then it is almost impossible to not like One Outs",

At first, I thought that this is just a typical sports anime wherein they train and strive to become champions but it turns out its not. Even if you are not a baseball fan, you will still enjoy watching this. You don't even need to understand baseball just to watch this. I'd say its more like gambling than baseball. I liked the way how he crushes his enemies under his feet so that they could not get back up. The characters arewell-developed and the story is so great that it will make you watch for more. I can also say that Tokuchi is the smartest anime character. The sound effects fit perfectly for every situation the team is in. The art is not that commendable but suits this show. You won't find heroines or female characters here but so what? It is still a great show. Every episode will make you adore Tokuchi. I highly recommend it for all especially to those who likes dark and intellectual animes.",

I finished this anime in 2 days, and I just have to say....Baseball meets Death Note. Tokuchi, Toua is in my mind the ultimate main character. He's just the definition of a bad ass and that's really what makes this anime so great. The supporting characters in my opinion were not that well developed but the performance of Tokuchi more then made up for that minor loss.\r\nThe score was simply beautiful when it was shown, the art was magnificient howeverlike I said sometimes the supporting characters didn't seem like they had a lot of progress. The antognist was your typical greedy SOB which made you cringe when you saw him. \\n\\n\r\nHowever the main part of this anime is suspense. You can't enter an episode and not wonder what is gonna happen next, that is how well this anime is made. It keeps you guessing and let me tell you, good luck guessing how Toua thinks, because it's damn near impossible. \\n\\n\r\nOverall a 9/10, it's definetely an overlooked anime that deserves some light.

Put someone who is as smart as Light Yagami on the pitchers mound in major league baseball, and you got One Outs.  The concept is pretty simple, but its so cool to see how complex these games can get, especially towards the end of the show.  This is just a fun show to watch, keeping you on the edge of your seat, knowing what is going to happen but just wondering HOW it's going to happen.  Sure, some of the games may have been a little unrealistic, but Iwas surprised that it didn't go over the top unrealistic like Kuroko's Basketball or something along those lines.  \\n\\n\r\nTokuchi definitely kept me entertained throughout this entire show, always keeping me guessing.  This is actually a way that the show thrived.  Unlike Death Note (which a lot of people compare this show to) we do not get a window into the mind of this (evil?) genius.  We view everything from the perspective of everyone around him, rather than hearing his thoughts every other second, which I absolutely loved.  It was a really cool change of pace. \\n\\n\r\nMy biggest gripes about this show is it's lack of depth.  This show is complex for sure, but has little more to offer than intense, fun mind-games.  The characters don't really grow throughout the show, and even the overarching story doesn't really have a lot to offer.  The ending was fine, but it's not going down in the record books for being one of the best finales of all time.  It picks up at the beginning with the concept and the characters that go along with it, and offers a bunch of solid episodes with this concept.  It's not exactly episodic, but I also wouldn't say there is a well defined build, climax, and resolution of the story either.  This show is just a fun show to watch if you like the concept, but if you are not enjoying within a few episodes then you should probably find something else to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSentence:  I honestly feel like I have learned a lot about baseball throughout this show... would not have guessed that",

His character makes up for what the anime itself is lacking. The anime could have been way better if there were more interesting characters, showed a glimpse of Tokuchi's backstory, and what not.

Trying to escape from your mind. I can't really explain it in term but I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one who thinks of this. \r\nBut that isfor another day, we here to talk about One Out. While I do think this is a \"cheap\" version of Akagi, Akagi alone is a masterpiece by the way.

I'm pretty sure there are only like 5 or 10 of the animation project around. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening song and the ending song is good, I bought the digital copied of mine years ago. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is at a medium pace, meaning you can easily understand where this is going but at the same time it is so complex, it makes you think what will happen next.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's definitely a show I would recommend to anyone who loves this type of gambling anime. Yes, I said it gambling because despite it's a sports anime.

I'd definitely recommend this anime not only for people who enjoy the sports genre, but also those who like gambling style anime (i.e. Kaiji) and more mature themes such as Yakuza, crime, corruption and even moral choices.\r\nAlthough I'm not a baseball fan, I'm a big sports guy inevery sense: playing, watching and sports anime.

            "content": "-This review is in English and Spanish.\r\n-Esta Review esta en Ingles y Espa\u00f1ol.\r\nENGLISH\r\nAn anime betting,what could go wrong?\r\nWell, almost everything.\r\nI really like psychological animes and more even if they have bets, mainly because you can see how a character thinks in a mental struggle, his motivations coupled with the tension of the game and the use of interesting tactics,but this anime does not have any of that.\r\nFirst thing, the story is very simple, it's just your typical sports anime with the addition of the bets, only these do not influence much in the game, then if the bets do not influence nor is it astory of self-improvement this is a excuse to put the protagonist in a baseball team and that's it. Even with that you could do an interesting anime with interesting duels and others, but no, the anime also fails there because it's baseball, not a sport too complex, in fact for the end of the anime resort to cheap and unreal ideas to put emotion , Besides that its resolutions are horrible so neither so.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the characters I can not say much, the motivations of the protagonist are a mystery (because they do not exist) and except for two or three the rest have no idea of \u200b\u200banything (I doubt that the characters know how to play baseball except for the protagonist),besides that it has no tension because one of the things that makes an anime of bets entertaining is that they win or lose and how it influences them and here as you do not know anything of the protagonist I can not feel anything for him.A curious thing is that to be a team sport is curious that depends of a single person,only one.The characters are flat or are nonexistent, except for one or two who detain them some time, because they do not dedicate time, they only dedicate themselves to talk about the techniques and others.\\n\\n\r\nAs the visual section is good, good fluidity and an appropriate palette coupled with a good quality of the drawings, but not that it is spectacular,sadly I can not say the same of the sound section, although some environmental issues match the anime, a large part are forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nIn general I can say that he has tried to be a different sports anime, getting new things, the concept is good but between the flat characters and his plot that I try to change but stayed in your typical sports plot that everyone praises for being different.\\n\\n\r\nEven after everything I said the anime was entertaining, but nothing else.\\n\\n\r\nFINAL NOTE 5/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nESPA\u00d1OL\\n\\n\r\nUn anime de apuestas,\u00bfque podr\u00eda salir mal?\\n\r\nBueno,pues casi todo.\\n\\n\r\nRealmente me gustan los animes psicol\u00f3gicos y m\u00e1s incluso si tienen apuestas, principalmente porque se puede ver c\u00f3mo piensa un personaje en una lucha mental, ver sus motivaciones,unido a la tensi\u00f3n del juego y el uso de t\u00e1cticas interesantes, pero este anime no tiene nada de eso.\\n\\n\r\nLo primero de todo,la historia es muy simple,es s\u00f3lo tu anime t\u00edpico de los deportes con la adici\u00f3n de las apuestas,s\u00f3lo \u00e9stos no influyen mucho en el juego,entonces si las apuestas no influyen,ni es una historia de auto-mejora \u00bfesto que es? Una excusa para poner al protagonista en un equipo de b\u00e9isbol. Incluso con eso podr\u00edas hacer un anime con duelos interesantes y dem\u00e1s, pero no, el anime tambi\u00e9n falla all\u00ed porque es b\u00e9isbol, no es un deporte demasiado complejo, de hecho para el final del anime recurre a ideas baratas e irreales (y predecibles) para poner emoci\u00f3n , Adem\u00e1s de que sus resoluciones son horribles as\u00ed que ni eso.\\n\\n\r\nSobre los personajes no puedo decir mucho, las motivaciones del protagonista son un misterio (porque no existen) y salvo dos o tres personajes el resto no tiene idea de nada (de hecho dudo que sepan jugar al b\u00e9isbol),adem\u00e1s de que no tiene tensi\u00f3n porque una de las cosas que hace un anime de apuestas entretenido es que ganan o pierden y como les influye y aqui como no se sabe nada del protagonista no puedo sentir nada por el.Una cosa curiosa es que para ser un deporte de equipo dependa de una sola persona, solo una. Los personajes son planos o inexistentes, salvo uno o dos que les dan alg\u00fan tiempo, porque no dedican tiempo a los personajes,solo se dedican a hablar de las t\u00e9cnicas y demas.\\n\\n\r\nLa secci\u00f3n visual es buena,buena fluidez y una paleta adecuada junto con una buena calidad de los dibujos,aunque no es que sea espectacular,por desgracia no puedo decir lo mismo del apartado sonoro,aunque algunos temas ambientales coinciden con el anime,una gran parte son olvidables.\\n\\n\r\nEn general puedo decir que ha intentado ser un anime deportivo diferente,que intento cambiar, el concepto es bueno pero entre los personajes planos y su argumento que trato de ser diferente pero se quedo en tu tipoco anime de deportes que todo el mundo alaba por ser diferente.\\n\\n\r\nAun despu\u00e9s de todo lo que he dicho,el anime estuvo algo entretenido,pero nada mas.\\n\\n\r\nNOTA FINAL 5/10",

            "content": "Okay so ill summarize what this show is in two words, \"PSYCHOLOGICAL BATTLES!\".\r\nThe main character is a pitcher, but not in the way other baseball pitchers are. His fastest pitch is only about the speed a high school pitcher throws, and he doesn't throw super crazy unrealistic pitches either that like movie with his mind or anything.\r\nWhat he basically does is play mind games against each and every one of his opponents. He throws the pitch you plan to not swing at, but then when you plan to swing at it, he throws the pitch you wont. Its almost that simple, but then again itsway more complex.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is, this pitcher using his abilities to play in the majors in japan, but not being paid an annual salary like everyone else, instead he turns the whole game into a gambling match. He gains money for each out he gets, and loses money for each run he gives up. The big catch is, the amount he loses for a run much much higher then what he gets from an out.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is especially good, because you don't hear the plans from the main characters mind, but you hear the thoughts of the victims. So the whole time you feel as if you are a part of the struggle to get a hit off this pitcher that is playing mind games with everyone. Ill tell you right now, you may think you and your team are winning the battle, but in reality you are sinking in a deep mental trap and are losing the war.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like shows like Death Note, Code Geass, Kaiji and others that have a psychological aspect that feels a lot like intense action, you will like this show and be eager for another season of it.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like my review you can add me to MAL friends. This is my second review : )\\n\\n",

READ IT FULLY!!!\r\nOne Outs is a perfect combo of pshycological and sports anime...each has equal importance and nothing weighs more in quantity and quality over the other, in other words it genuinely gives importance to both the genres in an intelligent way which makes this anime stand out of other sports anime...\r\nIt is a story about a non proffesional baseball player who gets spotted by a lyacons team legend  hiromichi who needed a pitcher for his team desperately and getsgreatly inspired by tokuchi touato a extent that he urges the owner of the team to sign him and thus starts the Mindfucking  One Outs...\\n\\n\r\nART~ everyone in this anime is really well drawn , starting from tokuchi toua whose inspiration is surely taken from hisoka from hunter x hunter but that look is perfect for tokuchi as that surely shows how dangerous he is as a gambler and his captivating personality ...then other players are also well drawn, the stadium,the crowd,the streets..every tit bit is given ample importance...u will like the ART for sure... a 8/10 for me..\\n\\n\r\nSOUND~ the opening is awesome....i really liked it...and the ost track for tokuchi is my favorite... this anime has simple yet spine chilling soundtrack and a super awesome starting track... the soundtrack adds the more captivating and mind playing aura of this anime..it enhances it to a great level... 8/10 for me \\n\\n\r\nCharcter~ every one is given ample time for character development...and variety of characters are also included which not only adds upto the variety in sports genre but also adds upto the increasing level of psychology too...mind games just increase potentially with entry of new characters so is the excitement with their sporting skills...and each character has his aura which will greatly affect u too in a positive manner... tokuchi toua being also my top 10 great admiring characters too...he is on another level , even i felt he surpassed light yagami of death note[just a comparison, even i liked light a lot]\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT~ there isnt a time in this anime where you will get bored, even if you hate baseball or dont know its basics, i am challenging you after seeing this anime you will see baseball in whole new light and you will start watching it..every concept is well explained , even a dummy like me who dint even knew the ABC of baseball understood and enjoyed it to the fullest... the mindgames of tokuchi toua will take ur sheer enjoyment level to a new level and i bet you just cant wait after finishing an episode and will want to know what happens next... every character, every games, every stadium has a different feel and different charisma to it... i am 100% sure you will enjoy it to the fullest.. 9/10 for me in this sector\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL~ I dint expected a lot from this anime as it had baseball as its sports area, but i wanted to see it because it also had psychology genre too...but after watching it i was awestruck and not only became the fanboy of TOKUCHI TOUA but also loved baseball...

            "content": "One Outs is basically a baseball anime which focuses on \"mind games\" and the psychological aspect. It focuses on a pitcher called Tokuchi who isn't that technically good except for his control, but utilises mindreading-tier levels of psychoanalysis to always outdo his opponent.\r\nAs a seinen you may be thinking these would be quite advanced strategies, but in reality that's not really the case. It's quite contrived in that all of his absurd (and usually not that complicated) plans all succeed without a hitch and he was pulling the strings all along, but I guess that's what's gotta happen when you're writing a series like this.\r\nForentertainment purposes, there's nothing wrong with this, and I did find myself enjoying it quite a bit. Most of the stakes are around his gamble with the owner of the club rather than the actual game, as you soon get a sense that he'll never actually be outdone. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the big flaw for me is the constant overexplanation. The main character, Tokuchi, is basically portrayed as a flawless genius who is always as cool as a cucumber and never ever looks like he's at all close to being outdone. On the other hand, his baseball team is fulll of the absolute stupidest people you'd ever seen. You wouldn't be amiss thinking these were amateurs of baseball rather than (laughably) pros. At every junction it seems rather basic concepts of baseball have to be explained to PROFESSIONAL baseball players.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, during the games, especially in the latter half of the series, Tokuchi generally spends half the screentime explaining things in a very drawn-out way to the merry band of dullards who surround him. Not only does he draw these explanations (of often fairly simple things) out needlessly, he also randomly stops talking and lets the dullard team members constantly talk among themselves and try and guess what he means for about 10 minutes before he finally just comes out with it. At times it can be frustratingly stupid, and when Tokuchi finally figures out the (obvious) answer, he's treated as a genius.\\n\\n\r\nFor me it was a 7/10 for the first half (the first 2 episodes are also rather annoying with the overexplanation), but definitely went down to 5-6/10 for the second half, the constant dragging and explaining every little thing for 10 minutes was really tedious. The final games can be characterised by 15 minutes of needless explanation and 7 minutes of stuff actually happening.",

What makes this work so well is that the series provides you a set of rules and expectations, and allows the viewer all the information needed to predict what might happen, making the viewer truly feel like the spectator of a high stakes game while simultaneously putting us in the shoes of the characters as we make strategiesalongside the cast. This dynamic is built organically and truly adds an extra layer of enjoyment to each scene. The series doesnt have a strong moral message beyond the tag line, \"The only one who wins is I\". This is meant to express the idea that if you want victory you must be willing to do everything, anything in order to reach it, your pride, your morals, your life, you must be willing to put them on the line if you want true victory. \\n\\n\r\nArt 7: The art is stylistic, but quite standard in nature. It is made competently and has no real loose ends or loss in quality, which is pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8: The audio is pretty much the same as the art, solid, competent and done in a way that fits the story...but that op is damn good, like whooo that sound track just makes you pumped to watch some full body nuuudi---uhm...I mean..some full contact pooo--uhm...I mean...baseball...yeah.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7: This is probably the weakest one, as there arent many characters that get developed very thoroughly, but they are still fairly done, and many get enough screen time to not feel like wasted space. The real 'character' though is our protag and god is he one smooth as butter dude. Seriously, its like Dio fused with Hisoka and decided that baseball was more profitable than bounty hunting or world domination. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8: This series is absolutely perfect in both tension and action, having an excellent sense of pace that makes every moment feel on the edge. The series is fun, exciting, and expresses a unique message in a unique form that makes you ponder....before you are yet again glued to the screen because the tension just ramped again.\\n\\n\r\nOver all 8: First thing to remember about this series if you are reading this to see if you should try it is that THIS IS NOT A BASEBALL ANIME!!!! This is a gambling anime with a baseball theme. What this means is that most of the series conflict is more centered around mind games, manipulating the rules, and the rising stakes that each game holds. Personally, Im a huge fan of his sub genre, and I highly recommend this to anyone who is interested in it, but if you want a story about the sport of baseball, then this is not what you are looking for.",

            "content": "One Outs, an anime about baseball does something that none of the other sports anime does. It takes a generic formula about a weak team trying to make it big but adds its own peculiar twist  and flavor to it; this makes the anime a very exciting and fun watch. \r\nAs it was mentioned earlier, One Outs is essentially a baseball anime. The plot revolves around the team Saikyou Saitama Lycaons, more specifically around the pitcher Tokuchi Toua. Lycaons is a weak team filled with mediocre and simple minded players who are lead by their talented and lead batter Kojima. Despite being a worldclass player and a representative of Japan, Kojima's dream to win the championship remains unfulfilled due to his under-performing teammates. It is during this time he meets Toua, a pitcher who excels at the game One Out which is just gambling mixed with Baseball. After long series of events Toua finally relents to Kojima's request and joins the Lycaons as a relief pitcher. Toua is a shrewd individual and a cunning schemer. Despite being able to pitch only fastballs, he uses his wits and psychological knowledge to outwit his opponents. The psychological aspect of the show is where the show deviates from the overused plot of sports anime. Its not about having a trusting team and to win through team work and reliance. The team is absolutely dominated by Touchi. They follow Touchi's every command, they do question him from time to time, but they all acknowledge his superiority; by the end of the anime even the coach of team becomes Toua's personal dog. Each team that the Lycaons face have their own masterclass tactician and tactics, who challenge Toua's intelligence. Though, no matter how tough the going gets Toua ultimately stumps everyone and wins, herein the anime remains true to its tagline which is,\"No one wins, but I\". At a glance such repeated usage of plot points and devices might seem boring on the surface, it is thoroughly entertaining. Each teams tactics varies, from cheating to ending rules everything works as long as you aren't caught. The other aspect of the show deals with Toua' feud with the owner of the team. One of the main reason why Lycaons lost was because of the money minded owner who used dirty tactics, spot fixing and blackmail to use the team to make himself money. As Toua had no formal baseball background the owner becomes reluctant to give him a contract and thus gambles with him. Toua gets 5 mil for every out and pays 50 mil for every run. The owner thinks that Toua is a fool and he has made a bargain with the contract, but soon learns that he made a deal with the devil. Thus, to stop Toua from wining the bet he goes out of ways to spoil Toua's game. He uses underhanded tricks to win but remains largely unsuccessful, again herein the show religiously sticks to its principle motto. Even though the owner appears to be a serious and an endearing villain, he mostly used as a comic relief. His insane and over the top reactions and plans are reminiscent of Tom or the Coyote from the cartoons. He thinks he has the perfect plan, which has no holes; yet time after time Toua exploits his own plan and does something which no one expects. The owner as a villain is overshadowed by the owner as a comedian is wildly under used. The mangaka in his other manga Liar Game has written great villains which the story misses here. The shine of individual villains is reduced due to the lackluster main villain. The psychological aspects and schemes that Toua uses are extremely well thought off and adapted. Sometimes they are simple and others they are extremely complex; the complex ones do create a problem sometimes. To put it plainly would be that the complex plans need too much stretch to succeed. It is all based on assumptions and predicted behavior of characters. The assumptions are sometimes too much and often are unreasonable. The best part about having a human or human-esque villain lies in the fact that they are unpredictable. They can perform any action and yet the hero should have a trick to deceive them. This is what worked for greats like Death Note and Code Geass. Many fans compare this to the holy duo, but I feel that this severely lags behind due to its overstretched assumptions. Often I felt that the author used random facts from the internet and unverified studies as basis of the plan, which reduced the quality of the story. Also, as the hero always won here, the story got a bit bland by the end; all of the plans of the hero worked with 10% success and there was not a moment of rush that was felt. I felt that the tensions could have been elevated and the stakes could have been higher; make no mistake that despite this it was entertaining till the very end.\\n\\n\r\nThe weakest aspect of the anime was the characters. Toua on his own was a excellent static character. He was cool, arrogant, smart and was in total control. His teammates on the other hand were just a bunch of mentally slow individuals. Kojima was the only other character, who seemed at least capable of making smart decisions in life. The catcher Gouto showed little promise and all the others had no hope. From the coach to the players were pretty much the same simple minded individuals in different clothing. The same applied to the opponent team too; wherein there existed one genius schemer who was slightly less of a genius than Kojima and everyone else was just moving cardboard pieces with no feelings or motivations of their own. They all followed what the alpha male said without a question and the team based sport was ultimately reduced to one player and various pieces of wood. The character development too was next to nil. The characters remained the same aimless people with no where to go. The anime felt no need to develop its characters at all. All that mattered was that they follow the king's order, and what better to do that than have mindless subjects. At a time where even titans seem to be able to talk and have growing personalities, the lack of personalities and growth for humans was disturbing. \\n\\n\r\nThe art of the show was refined and had a mature look to it. The realistic animation and design really helped convey the story the anime wanted to tell . The closeup and far shots were well done, though the camera work could have been better. The anime used the same cuts a lot, which would have been a bad thing for any other sports anime. As this one specifically focused on the pitcher and the catcher the cuts felt adequate. The sound and the music is where the anime really hit a home run. The opening was really energetic and helped set the manly tone of the anime. The video used for the opening focused solely on Toua which indicated the direction the show wanted to take. The OST were extremely well written and used. They are what helped elevate the stress and tension even when they wren't. They made the show way more energetic and helped overcome some dull moments and overall they aptly portrayed the epicness of Toua and his brain. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, I would like to say that One Outs is a entertaining and a damn good watch, though if you are a kind of watcher who longs for an emotional connectivity with the anime or the characters, then this one ain't for you.",

            "content": "One Outs is a sports anime based on the long-running manga of the same title by Shinobu Kaitani, one of my absolute favorite manga artists. To call One Outs a sports anime is a little misleading. While it does revolve around a baseball team, the anime is more concerned with the psychological workings of its main character, Tokuchi Toa.\r\nTokuchi is a gambler by nature. At night, he can be found playing a very popular game called One Outs with a platoon of stationed American soldiers. The rules of the game are simple: pitcher versus batter. If the pitcher manages to strike out the batter ormake the batter hit the ball within the infield, the pitcher wins. If the batter manages to hit the ball outside of the infield, the batter wins. People place bets on either the pitcher or the batter, and major money is on the line.\\n\\n\r\nTokuchi is always the pitcher.\\n\\n\r\nAlways.\\n\\n\r\nAnd he\u2019s remarkably good. While he only pitches roughly 75 mph (slow in comparison to most major league pitchers), his record is practically flawless. He strikes out batters like nobody\u2019s business and is an arrogant prick about it too.\\n\\n\r\nEnter Hiromichi Kojima, a famous major league baseball player in Japan comparable to Sammy Sosa out here in the States. However, in all his long years of playing baseball with Lycaons (a fictional baseball team) he\u2019s never won the championship, despite his individual prowess on the field.\\n\\n\r\nKojima challenges Tokuchi to a game of One Outs with \u201ctheir arms\u201d on the line. If Tokuchi wins, Kojima will give him a ridiculous amount of money. And if Tokuchi wins, Kojima gets Tokuchi\u2019s arm. Tokuchi Toua will be forced to join the Lycaons.\\n\\n\r\nNow I bet you can all guess that Tokuchi loses. After all, the show would be pretty damn boring if Tokuchi won a butt load of money and went off to buy a yacht or whatever. So now Tokuchi has been thrust into the world of professional baseball and is pitching for the Lycaons.\\n\\n\r\nThe main device of this story, however, is Tokuchi\u2019s contract with the crooked manager. Tokuchi believes in merit equaling pay-out. To that end, he sets up this deal:\\n\\n\r\n\u201cFor every batter I get out, I get 5,000,000 yen. But for every run I allow, I pay you 50,000,000 yen.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThe manager thinks he\u2019s struck gold when it comes to this dumb rookie pitcher. But Tokuchi\u2019s skills prove otherwise, and the manager has to think of dastardly ways to take down the miracle newbie.\\n\\n\r\nThe show follows Tokuchi\u2019s adventures with Lycaons baseball team as he tries to protect his yearly salary and make a killing in the ultimate gamble. He comes up against a variety of tough opponents, each one needing to be outwitted or outplayed.\\n\\n\r\nOne Outs is an interesting series to swallow. First of all, you don\u2019t necessarily need to like baseball to like this show. In fact, if you\u2019re a baseball fan, you may find this show hard to stomach at first. (I know I did.) There are things about the way these guys play baseball that is just not realistic. In fact, some stuff is just plain ridiculous. But if you ignore the glaring flaws when it comes to the baseball logistics, you can actually really enjoy yourself.\\n\\n\r\nTokuchi is an interesting main character. Not necessarily likeable, as he pretty much is entirely self-driven and seems to only care about money. Still, his selfish motives end up helping a lot of other people out indirectly, so you can forgive him for that. He\u2019s also disturbingly anti-social and kinda scary to look at. However, he is just a bit of a genius, and watching him take out his opponents one by one is both frightening and exhilarating.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting characters are somewhat well done. Unfortunately, most of the time, they exist to simply explain Tokuchi\u2019s genius and stare dumbfounded at just how damn smart he is. Kojima is redeemable in the fact that he\u2019s the only one on the team who doesn\u2019t positively fanboy over Tokuchi.\\n\\n\r\nIdeguchi, the catcher, is another story. He\u2019s pretty much Tokuchi\u2019s number one fan, and while he\u2019s certainly likeable (rookie catcher = kinda adorable), he hardly ever gets to do anything cool himself. Most of the time, he\u2019s just following Tokuchi\u2019s instructions. Then again, he arguably becomes Tokuchi\u2019s best friend on the team (catcher and pitcher relationship for the win!) and you forgive him his initial ignorance as he matures and wises up over the course of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThere are few characters who are purely comic relief, but they do it well, especially considering the main character of the show is about as funny as a petting zoo catching on fire. After so much \u201cbazball iz seriuz bzness!\u201d you need a bit of a break, and these guys provide it just fine.\\n\\n\r\nTokuchi\u2019s opponents are actually very well done. They\u2019re not complete dopes at all. In fact, most of them are quite skilled and give Tokuchi a real problem to work his way out of. I wish the final opponent had been a bit more threatening and epic, but eh, twenty five episode anime is twenty five episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST is generally pretty good, although the opening and ending themes leave something to be desired. The actual BG music in the show is pretty good though. I wouldn\u2019t mind DLing it and giving it another listen for nostalgia\u2019s sake.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the anime becomes very \u201cvillain of the week-ish\u201d after Tokuchi joins the Lycaons. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the baseball games last more than one episode \u2013 in fact, some can span as many as five or six. But the formula is more or less the same for every single opponent and Tokuchi never really grows as a character. In fact, no one really grows that much. The Lycaons decide they actually want to win, but other than that, no single character really discovers anything about themselves. The main device of the plot is Tokuchi and his money. Which can get a little old after awhile.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, the anime is pretty stunning. It followed Kaitani-sensei\u2019s original designs pretty well, adding in a bit more detail and attractive coloring to make a generally great looking show.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime, unfortunately, is only one season long and cuts off before the original manga ended. So the ending is not exactly unsatisfying, but incomplete. Sports animes should end with the team winning the god damn championship. That\u2019s how it works. Unfortunately, time constraints meant that this anime would have to settle for ending after a semi-important game.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, One Outs is one of those shows that you watch purely for fun. If you enjoy puzzles/psychological thrillers/sports/blonds, then you\u2019ll probably enjoy this show. I\u2019m a fan of sports anime and of psychological stuff, so this one was a winner in terms of enjoyment for me. Is this one of my favorite animes? Eh, not really. But it was fun while it lasted. But having a main character who is hard to relate to can isolate audiences. If you can\u2019t find a reason to like Tokuchi, you won\u2019t like this show.\\n\\n\r\nBut I do like Tokuchi. It\u2019s fun watching him pick apart his opponents\u2019 psyches. So I really did enjoy One Outs.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\n(But the OP really is ridiculous.)",

            "content": "Have you ever thought of a baseball player who is actually has a smart mind and can calls the shot around everyone who think they will beat a intelligent man, put that together with a manager really wants you lose so bad that throws you alot of situations to prevent you win the big gold? That's what this series is all about, winning at all cost.\r\nStory(8):Meet Toua Tokuchi a gambler, and a One Outs baseball champion undefeated who is improving at his best at pitching. All of a sudden, things changed when Hiromichi Kojima is the first man who defeats Toua after his rematch.After thematch, Kojima makes Toua to join this baseball team called Lycaons(the weakest team in baseball) to help out the team win their first championship.After he joins the team, he meets the manager of the Lycaons who requests Toua to sign the One Outs contract to include huge amounts of money if he wins a match. But, if Toua loses the manager will take Toua's money down the drain.Toua accepts the deal, and that's when the exciting adventure of Toua just getting started. The story is actually quite amazing to watch just to see what Toua's actions are going to do with the opponents he is about to face. One minor problem from making the story of a masterpiece is the ending is...... what say it makes you want something more out of it to see what's happening next. And, sometimes the arcs makes it feel like it is predictable which is not bad but it gets sorta tedious from it. Out of that the story is very nice that it is very different from what you usually see from regular baseball with some huge twists.\\n\\n\r\nArt(8):Nothing to say anything bad on the art. It features red background face whenever Toua makes a grin on his face when he defeats opponents which is good. The characters looks nice which is nice though the whole art ain't memorable to look at you finish watching the show.\\n\\n\r\nSound(8): The sound is fantastic, with you first hear the opening theme song features slow beat that gives you goosebumps from listening to it. Also, the ost is pretty good when something get interesting going on to the characters at the right time. One problem aspect to the sound is sometimes the songs get repetitive to hear once you already hear it again it gets annoying. One example is after the ending theme the preview songs comes, and it brings it again in some occasionally with a scene. It gets annoying that you want a new song come in so you don't have to listen to it again.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(9): One Outs has the greatest characters you will ever see. Their personalities are very unique that it makes you wanting to like them. Including  the villain(manager) makes you really want to him so bad, and Toua(sorta like a hero to the team of Lycaons) makes you like the characters. The rest of the characters did a very good job as their role to this series including the rivalries of the Lycanos.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9):This show has very high enjoyment. With huge twists type of cat and a mouse in the whole sport of baseball. It makes you very entertained  that it you will be wondering, \"why baseball isn't like this type of show?\"\\n\\n\r\nOverall(9):Best sport show you will ever seen. If you like baseball, not a huge fan of baseball, or not even a fan of sports in general but just like smartful characters,than this one will like the show even more that you will be cringing your teeth, and have your edge on your seat.If you like physiological shows with a smartful character and a evil villain morals his plans to bring a character than you will like this show for sure like I have been enjoying it for me.",

            "content": "One Outs is a story about some loser team aiming for the top with their veteran, Kojima, and the new guy, Tokuchi. Well, that's the story from the Lycaons' perspective, which we don't really care about. The real deal is going on behind everyone's backs with some shady deal between Tokuchi and the team's owner. The story focuses on things like deception, mind games, and cheating. \r\n[+] I didn't like the opening theme. It sounds kinda emo or something and flaunts a half-naked Tokuchi. The ending theme didn't catch my attention, so I didn't watch/listen to it even once. \r\n[+] Hearing Kaiji's voice from Tokuchiwas a little weird, but I think I mostly disliked the lack of emotion in Tokuchi's character. \\n\r\n[+] The art was fine for the most part. I thought it was annoying and unfitting how they'd sometimes make it seem a little bit like a gag manga, throwing in some \"THAT'S THE JOKE. LAUGH.\" moments. I was also annoyed when two players were getting excited and shouting with some \"exciting\" background, both of them remaining rather still... it wasn't very convincing. \\n\\n\r\nAnd now for the main course of my review, the characters. I probably already spoiled your appetite, but you're still reading this, so let's proceed. \\n\\n\r\nK O J I M A\\n\r\nI never imagined myself to be someone that would enjoy sports anime (other than Hajime no Ippo), but I really liked Kojima. He was introduced as a man aiming for the top through hard work and dedication. When he faces Tokuchi for the first time, you don't feel like cheering for Tokuchi, the unstoppable pitcher. You want Kojima to win since he's just such a great and respectable guy. This was the only real moment in the series that felt suspenseful to me. Would Kojima win or would he lose? We all know this anime is about Tokuchi just by watching the opening theme, so how will things turn out? Indeed, a very interesting moment made possible by Kojima's character. \\n\\n\r\nI D E G U C H I\\n\r\nThis guy is pretty useless, but he's smarter than the other team members. Tokuchi pretty much treats him like crap, but Ideguchi doesn't let that cloud his judgement; he can see that Tokuchi is an incredible man and he has a deep respect for that. In fact, when Ideguchi isn't busy taking up 5 minutes to think of a scheme that turned out to be 100% useless, he often likes to think to himself \"Wow, Tokuchi is really amazing!\" We come to like Ideguchi since he's in the know and Tokuchi trusts him, plus he's probably the only other player on the team that's really in it to win it. In the end, I don't think he really added that much to the story, though. \\n\\n\r\nT O K U C H I\\n\r\nI'm a bit disappointed, really. He's unstoppable and has virtually no weaknesses. He's unrivaled. This makes things a little boring since there's never any sense of danger. He's never really cornered. Everyone else is always freaking out, but Tokuchi knew everything would come to that moment and he already knew the way out. Sometimes he needs a little more evidence to come to his conclusion, in which case he sends out a few pawns to be sacrificed, then all is clear. He's definitely put into some tough situations, but the problem is that Tokuchi is too perfect and that nothing is ever a challenge. One nice thing about his character is how he improves the team and gets those losers to actually show some spirit, though that should probably be Kojima's job. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this was pretty enjoyable, but Tokuchi ruined most of the suspense.",

            "content": "TL:DR - Watch this. \r\nThe shows nowadays are littered with males who have so little testosterone that watching them interact with girls is actually akin to watching a yuri scene. The shows themselves are dull and insipid because they focus on the most average person in the room. Older shows like Death Note, FMA, GITS are so iconic mainly because none of the characters are whiny pricks. They each had a vision with believable flaws and limitations and they fought tooth and nail to bring their vision to life. \r\nNowadays its just a deluge of shows with utterly average people who do not have asingle interesting facet in their personality. From Re:zero's Subaru to BNHA's Izuku, everyone is a spineless, gutless, piece of shit protagonist suffering from serious, chronic deprivation of testosterone but they suddenly become awesome and powerful coz reasons.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are like me and you miss the brilliance of past characters like the Yagami Light's, the Edward Elric's and even to a certain extent the Kurosaki Ichigo's then my friend, you might love One outs. \\n\\n\r\nHere is a character who doesn't coast through life by being average and doesn't play sports to enjoy. The main character Tokuchi Toua, plays to win.. WIN.. BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY. If that means humiliating the opponent and breaking him down bit-by-bit, then so be it. No philosophical ramblings, no hesitation, no doubts. WIN.. At all costs. A man with a vision, and willing to do ANYTHING to achieve what he wants. Here is a deeply flawed character with believable limitations, who overcomes his opponents using sheer will and keen observation and quick wits. Stoicism is celebrated here, as it should be. Other shows have characters scream and cry and become awesome. Here its the traits of quiet deliberation, long term planning, calmly responding to situations which are celebrated. Awesome doesnt happen overnight, its not something that is inherited, its EARNED. By analysis, by predictions, by planning. Things that almost no other anime celebrates. \\n\\n\r\nComically almost every other aspect of the show apart from Tokuchi is utterly useless. Side characters mostly have less charm than cardboard cutouts, the music is serviceable, the animation average. But when the main character is this good and when some of the foes he faces are almost as formidable as him, nothing else matters. A great binge-worthy, fun to watch anime. \\n\\n",

            "content": "What would happen if you took a show with an average story, poor sound track, even worse artwork, and a cast of bland characters who never develop but add in one over powered protagonist? You get One Outs, a baseball show about a pitcher.\r\nStory - 6\r\nIn One Outs  you find the typical sports plot: \"Lets win the championship even though we are the underdogs in literally every scenario!\" with one minor change, being that our MC was not initially aiming for this goal. Instead, our MC wants to gamble. In fact, the sole reason Tokuchi even has to play with this team is becausehe lost a bet for the first time. But rest assured, our god-like pitcher will never lose again an even seems to develop a small desire to help his team win. However, Tokuchi pulls a tsundere move (male tsundere boy is that original!) saying it's all because of the bet he lost.\\n\\n\r\nThis story also lacks a key in sports anime: any sense of tension. Tokuchi never breaks a sweat and overcomes every \"pinch\" he is thrown into. And with only one championship on the line losing the Inter-High (or any other tournament) but winning the Winter Cup (or any subsequent tournaments) is not an option, so One Outs becomes a show of intrigue. \"How will Tokuchi win this time?\" becomes the question.\\n\\n\r\nOne nice twist in the genreal formula is that the Owner of the team does not care about how the team performs. All he cares about is money, so with the contract outlined in the series description + OP MC = a lot of possible debt.\\n\\n\\n\r\nidk if this is actually a spoiler but I don't wanna get yelled at. The story does not end and 6 years after it aired no second season, ova's, or even movies have been announced to give us a sense of closure. The writers even decided to time-skip to the beginning of the championship game from who-knows-where in the season. Only like 5 or 6 sereis between the Lycaons and opponents are animated.\\n\r\na\\n\\n\r\nArt - 4\\n\r\nI found the character designs for this show frustrating as they all seemed to deviate from 3 base designs, and I found them all appalling. Even worse is Tokuchi's hair. The shape is wrong and it only gets worse when he puts on his hat to go and pitch. The only time it isn't bad is inside his batting helmet. But seeing how Tokuchi is a pitcher we don't get many of those scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 5\\n\r\nNot much to say. I skipped the OP and ED at every turn after listening to them a couple times. The background music is pretty generic. The one thing One Outs improves upon is that the OP never changes. Most shows that span 2 airing seasons change the OP half-way through (around ep 11-13) to one that is even worse.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 7\\n\r\nOther than Tokuchi there are no other characters of note. Teammates and opponents alike never develop and are presented as complete children with the exception of Ideguchi and Kojima whose development was so miniscule you might miss it. Tokuchi himself never develops as he is in a completely different league from everybody else that he never experiences any crisis. Tokuchi's wit, planning, awareness, ability to keep a level head, and simple strategy are the selling points of this sereis. Rest assured, there are a lot of those moments.\\n\\n\r\nTokuchi himself is so constantly level headed and focused on victory that nothing ever phases him. This is in part due to his ability to always figure out what everybody else is thinking due to their body language and apply a countermeasure. Tokuchi is always able to see the flaws in his plan, be it his own or his opponents. Tokuchi always has a follow up plan for when the weakness in his current strategy is discovered, and the opponents just so happen to become more and more competent despite that they are only in the regular season. Of course Owner never grows smarter and is always destroyed by Tokuchi.\\n\\n\r\nAnd to make sure the audience understands everything One Outs features not 1, but 2 normal side characters. Tokuchi explains all of his plans to the audience via these characters. They amke sure anybody can understand what Tokuchi does. This may be an old and well used tactic but One Outs does a pretty decent job of it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9\\n\r\nJust because I disliked \"most aspects\" of this show, it is still something I would recommend to anybody. Why? In One Outs, 90% of the screen time is dedicated to Tokuchi. Whether he is riling up his opponents, distracting them, exposing their weakness, ignoring them, etc. Tokuchi vs. some random side character is this shows formula. And boy is it great to watch. Like I said, I learned to never doubt Tokuchi and isntead tried to predict what he would do. Don't bother. Nobody no matter their experience in baseball be they professional players in real life, ammatuer, or beginners will be able to predict Tokuchi. That was something I did not find frustrating at all. I loved it.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR review\\n\r\nOP MC beats every opponent in his way no matter how poorly drawn they are or how bad the background music is, or how good the side characters of One Outs present them to be. It has a generic story with 1 neat twist, and for all the things it does that frustrate me, Tokuchi makes up for it personally. Even people who know nothing about baseball can enjoy it due to the age old tactic of every super genius needs a normal person to accompany them. Tokuchi explains everything he does to that person, but more importantly to you. the viewer.",

Tokuchi has to explain every single detail about his plan to decieve the other Baseball team, forhis teammates to understand what he is talking about. Honestly it\u00b4s like watching Blues Clues.

            "content": "It\u2019s almost a sin to call this a baseball anime, though I suppose that is technically true. But it\u2019s really a battle of psychological warfare with one ultra-cool antihero. The Lycaons are a professional baseball team who won the championship in distant memory but have recently been ranked last. Tokuchi Toua is a pitcher whose skill is not so much in pitching as it is in gambling and analyzing his opponents\u2019 weaknesses. Discovered in a gambling den, Tokuchi arranges a special contract with the team where he gets paid for each out he provides\u2014and pays them for each point he allows.\r\nTokuchi has what may bethe coldest, most calculating eyes in anime. He\u2019s a conceited nightmare: smoking and sleeping openly in the dugout, not bothering to practice, wearing his cap backwards, seemingly bored with everything\u2014and yet he manages to unite his team behind him and be a true ace. I loved him instantly. It\u2019s a delight to see everyone initially fail to take him seriously and then slowly come to realize what a grave mistake they\u2019ve made in underestimating him. This is truly an anime of epic mind games: Tokuchi vs. everyone, and the enemies can come from anywhere, including within the team itself.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019d recommend giving this anime at least three episodes to get going, because once the street gambling ends and the actual baseball begins, it\u2019s engrossing and kept me guessing what clever maneuver Tokuchi would come up with next to thwart rival teams and even the owner of Tokuchi\u2019s own team. After a while, I even started to like that stupid overbearing infodump narration. The problem with this anime, though, is its lack of character development (partially because we never get into Tokuchi\u2019s head and only see him from an outsider\u2019s perspective). But maybe it\u2019s more fun that way, watching Tokuchi psychologically manipulate his opponents. I found myself laughing aloud at his cleverness and sheer audacity. Needless to say, I\u2019d love a second season.",

            "content": "I don't know the first thing about sports, which shouldn't come as a surprise since I have a MAL account, and I have about as much interest when it comes to engaging with sports at all. I went to a baseball game when I was a little kid and cried that it was too hot (it was) until I was taken home. It was boring as hell, but the cartoons they played during half-time were pretty cool. Thus, if anything was going to make me reconcile with baseball it was my love for gambling anime.\r\nThe mysterious Toua Tokuchi is a brilliant pitcher who is scoutedby Lycaons ace batter Hiromichi Kojima during a gambling baseball game of \"One Outs\". Tokuchi is persuaded to join the Lycaons and save them from the bottom of the rankings by using his genius strategies that also utilize psychological mind games with the opponent, both of which more than make up for Tokuchi's slow pitching speed and basic technique.\\n\\n\r\nThat's not all though. In order to join the team Tokuchi enters into a \"One Outs\" contract with team owner Tsuneo Saikawa where he gains about $46,000 for every batter he strikes out, but loses $460,000 for every run that goes through while he's pitching. The greedy Saikawa only cares if his Lycaons team makes a profit for him rather than if they win and stops at nothing to defeat the taunting Tokuchi. Tokuchi also has to contend with the rest of the talented but easily pessimistic team and their lapdog doofus manager.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are like me and express any concern over such interesting situations coming out of an old pastime like baseball, let me immediately tell you that you shouldn't. One Outs is full of endless surprises and tricks that demonstrate the seemingly infinite variety of strategies the game is capable of. To state something that would normally be in the conclusion of anyone writing that had an actual affinity for sports, One Outs made me respect baseball much more than I did before. The game's rules are intricate and the ways each player can take advantage of them are clearly shown to be even more complex. On top of this, One Outs has its own unique contrivances due to its \"One Outs\" contract constantly strangling Tokuchi's movements, and the spread of enemy teams that each have their own distinct strategy for handling the Lycaons. It did not get old.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I was entertained by One Outs at all times, I did however feel it had a tendency to drag. The 25 episode anime actually only really goes through three teams, with an average of six episodes dedicated to each. That sounds very fair on paper, but I felt pressured knowing the series's premature run and wanted to see as many new characters and strategies as I could before it finished. There were times when Tokuchi had already beaten the opponent to the brow so much that there were diminishing returns on seeing them crushed. There's a pattern for the opponents to already show themselves as frustrated and in a corner, and this is when the sense of risk is decreased. I found that my favorite matches were against the BlueMars team, the token cheaters in every sports anime. Due to their willingness to cheat in every aspect of baseball there is a constant introduction of new tricks that rely on a totally different base strategy rather than variations of the same one, such as the Bugaboos's reliance on a fast runner or the Mariners with their star batters. It kept things fresher than the other teams because we hadn't seen Tokuchi approach each new trick in any way before. Though the other teams didn't have as steady momentum in their episodes I quite enjoyed the new unique characters that were sort of like rivals to Tokuchi rather than generic players. The Mariners had several of these which is why they're my second favorite match, and since they're ranked first in the league the sense of risk is the highest in the series.\\n\\n\r\nLike Akagi in his titular Mahjong anime, Tokuchi is clearly a cold undefeatable genius. It's of very little question that he'll win, which was something that worked against the Akagi series. However, One Outs circumvents this by introducing an emphasis on cooperaton and thus character building that other gambling anime lack. It's impossible for Tokuchi to succeed completely on his own because his agency is limited by the sheer number of players on the field and the roles he can't play in. It's not enough for Tokuchi to pitch well; he must also become a spiritual mentor to the Lycaons and influence their attitude and performance. Because Tokuchi can't have control over the entire game on his own a sense of unpredictability and the idea that everything could fall apart with ease still exists. Though Tokuchi appears to inspire faith in the Lycaons it's unfortunately often temporary and little growth is felt from what we see in the series. Though there's much to be desired when it comes to establishing the other Lycaons team members it's still an effort that exists and contributes greatly to the tension and feeling of victory in the show.\\n\\n\r\nBeing a Madhouse production, One Outs has above average animation quality. However, this is far from one of Madhouse's most dedicated projects. Though stock footage is used very little in a subject that easily welcomes it and the framerate isn't at all bothersome, the illustration is average to downright ugly when it comes to backgrounds, and there's little movement in many scenes. This is not at all a great example of production, but motion is felt and feedback through sound is strong enough that One Outs isn't limited by its production either. There's a soundtrack too but it's utterly disposable including the opening and credits themes, which is a shame.\\n\\n\r\nOne Outs has its restraints and they're what you would probably expect. Its sole focus on the games of baseball comes at a cost of any character or setting development and it never really goes anywhere because the anime doesn't completely adapt the manga, but it's a riveting ride while it lasts and I can't deny that it kept my attention more than the last several anime I watched. That means I liked it more than most despite limpness in several important areas, and I believe most people would like it as well. To put it another way: if One Outs were fully adapted and some 100 episodes longer, I would still be excited to continue watching it.",

            "content": "[English isn't my first language so sorry for any mistakes]\r\nI don't think I'd have ever noticed this anime if my friend hadn't eagerly introduced it to me. I'm not really into sports series but I was nicely surprised with One Outs. Above sports aspect, it's psychological. This is what made me fall for it. The main objective of poor team trying to reach the top with a new genius player isn't anything original but in One Outs you concentrate simply on matches' process, not this \"main quest\".\r\nIt'll be the easiest to start with the main character, Toua. We immediately get to know him as asly blonde fox using his abilities to earn easy money (and confuse others hah). His wit, self-confidence and sharp tongue make him a bold person. There's nothing really to tell about character development. I'd say there isn't any as the main character's personality stays the same, doesn't reveal anything new or expose his past. Although the series focus on Tokuchi, it's more about the way he outplays everyone, foresees others' decisions and dictates the game. He is seemingly amused and so was I. He may be cocky but at the same time very positive for the audience. You can enjoy matches along with Tokuchi who reveals certain bits of other players' nature and use this knowledge against them.\\n\r\nThe audience has a chance to try to figure out what Toua has on mind or uncode some signs before they get to be explained which also is a source of enjoyment (though it is a challenge if you ask me).\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I noticed is that calling Tokuchi a gambler is a little misleading. I guess the series attempts to make him look so but in fact he knows exactly what he does and is flawless in the tactics. Can it be called gambling? I don't think so. On the other hand it isn't something I assumed when started watching so the lack of actual gambling didn't matter to me as long as the battle of wits occured. I simply didn't have the slightest feeling of Tokuchi leaving anything to the mercy of fate. While others could perceive something as risky, he was aware of the obvious outcome.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was smooth and dynamic when needed, I didn't really find anything that would bother me. The tension was built just right making you wan I don't know, I was often focused on Tokuchi's wild hair untamable by mere cap.\\n\\n\r\nAs a person who never took interest in baseball I can say I didn't have any problem with following some explainations and the matches didn't weary me. Every of them was different in a way. Also there's quite a lot of space left for particular players so the show isn't strictly centered around Toua. Although as I mentioned, there isn't really any character development.\\n\\n\r\nI honestly enjoyed every single episode and I'm a bit disappointed the second season is unlike to be made (especially that the ending is left open). I recommend it to those who either like sports or psychological category, with the latter emphasised. This series differs from much more popular sports themed anime but in my view it's a huge advantage. \\n\r\nAnd I'm sure you'll appreciate Toua.",

            "content": "Based on manga by Shinobu Kaitani One Outs has a lot of similarities with manga Liar Game by the same author. Tokuchi Toua and Akiyama Shinichi are similar in a lot of factors, such as these two are extremely self confidient and super smart characters being dragged in a gambling game for huge money, which they cannot afford to lose.\r\nSo you probably noticed that this anime is about baseball, as for myself, I was reluctant to watch One Outs for this reason. I don't like baseball, don't care, don't know the rules and don't have intention to learn it. But it didn't matter much (thoughsome baseball explanations made me bored but mostly it was fine) because baseball isn't the main thing here, it's just a setting. It's about Tokuchi Toua struggling for victory and using all means to win.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the character Tokuchi Toua is shown as a very perceptive man who is able to notice little things and turn them against his opponent. He is a master in psychology and human manipulation. Though there is not much background information about him, rather no background information at all, you can only guess what was his life before and how did he became such a person. Of course it is not the easy life making you strong and smart. So at the beginning he was playing street version of baseball \"One Outs\" with no lose at all and that's all about his past. The rest is up to your imagination.\\n\\n\r\nMusic is good, especially the OP and ED, I didn't skipped, because every time I heard those songs, I just couldn't skip so enjoyable tracks.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum up I'd say that One Outs deserves being ranked #148 (at the moment). This anime can make you like baseball (not me) and it is a very good anime about sports, moreover tricks. I could watch this anime for long time not counting the amount of episodes and being not bored. Tokuchi Toua also resembles main characters from Death Note and Code Geass, as very smart and using cool tricks at the right time.",

If you took some Nihongo lessons,that might come handy on the raw mangas and also the IME pad(a windows tool) can be really helpful on the kanji, cause not all the kanji have furigana(so you really can't read it unless you know the kanji)\\n\\n\r\nThat's all\\n\r\nThank you for reading",

Im not that familiar with the sports but this show really caught my attention, which made me finish the series in one whole day. (please excuse for the wrong grammars ^^)\r\nWhile watching one outs, even though I didn\u2019t really know about baseball rules, whatsoever, I still find myself enjoying and laughing whenever Tokuchi Toua (the protagonist), played his tricks on their opponents and their teams manager. \r\nI don\u2019t want to spoil this series to you,but let me tell you a part of the story. Tokuchi Toua is known as a really good gambler who can read his opponents mind, lost to Kojima in a battle called One outs. After defeating Toua, Kojima decided to invite him into his team called the Lycaons who always placed last in baseball ranking. However, the lycaons owner, not trusting Toua, who has no Baseball record except for his record in one outs stated that he will not receive a yearly salary but only for the performance that he showed during the games. But Toua refuse the offer and instead make a deal that whenever he pitches and force a batter out, he will receive 5,000,000 yen for every batter but for every successful base run for an opponent during his pitching, he will pay 50,000,000 yen. This is a very exciting game of psychological battle and strategy. I recommend you to watch it guys^^. Again sorry for wrong grammars. haha\\n",

            "content": "*very minor spoilers within*\r\nFirst off I should say I typically hate sports anime/manga. This is one of the few exceptions. One Outs is a sports anime for people who typically aren't fans of the genre. Whether you love or hate baseball really holds no bearing on this series. It focuses more on the psychological battles that take place between the players more than the actual game itself. The main star of the series, Toua Tokuchi, can be best summed up as the Gregory House of baseball. Each episode Toua is presented with a different problem and it's up to his genius level ability of figuringpeople out, to solve it.\\n\\n\r\nThings start out relatively simple with Toua easily defeating every opponent with little effort put forth on his part. But once the regular play season starts, the teams start pulling out all the stops in their efforts to defeat Toua. Things such as recruiting a track star that can steal bases faster than the ball can be thrown to tag him out, to a stadium with wiretaps all over the place. Even the Lycaons owner tries to screw him over on a regular basis. This is mainly because the owner actually makes more money when his team loses, but also due to the special contract Toua created. The 'One Outs' contract. For every batter Toua strikes out he gets five million yen, but for every run scored against him, he pays the owner fifty million yen. Of course this totally backfires on the owner and becomes a running joke during the series as you get to see his yearly salary soar to ridiculous heights. Toua's got a lot on his plate. It's always fun watching Toua's reaction to things. If someone tries to fuck him over, he'll turn around and fuck them over threefold. I almost feel sorry for some of them.\\n\\n\r\nWith Madhouse on animation you know a series will look great. One Outs is no exception. Everything is very fluid when need be, and typically cheesy when applicable. It feels like they did a great job of bringing the manga to life. The opening animation is the only thing I have an issue with. Not because it's bad or anything, but because it's clearly designed to try and get girls to watch this show by showing a practically naked Toua floating around the screen. He's shirtless and is wearing his pants unbuttoned and unzipped. If a strong enough breeze came through, his di** would be out. I prefer taco to sausage thank you very much.\\n\\n\r\nThe only other issue I have is the fact that the series doesn't have a proper ending. It concludes at a good stopping point though, but things were clearly left open for a potential second season or OVA sequel. The manga is still running in japan I believe. Both the anime and manga have yet to be licensed for a U.S. release. While the manga has a chance, the anime probably doesn't. Sports anime never sells over here so it'd be a big risk for a company to pick up. It makes me sad because I would definitely buy it. But for now i'll just have to stick to the fansubs.\\n\\n\r\nIf this review got you interested in this series then I highly recommend checking it out. You won't be disappointed. It's a sports series that your average genre hater could actually get into. Don't let the near naked Toua in the opening scare you away. Take a gamble on 'One Outs', it's worth the risk.",

At the same time as One outs is a baseball anime mixed with gambling, it fixates the story too much in this part making the story difficult to understand if you don't know the ground rules for baseball. Also after only watching a few episodes you can kind of predict what's going to happen next with the main story as it looks like no major adjustments are going to happen.\r\nHowever I'm not going to prow forever, this anime should be credited for the work that's been produced. Overallthis anime is a one of a kind, with logical tactical thinking that you don't normally witness and tension can be built up in lots of places. Like when the leading protoganist isn't in favour of winning and is being targeted by the opponents. \\n\r\nYou get hooked on the last game and it draws you in at the end, great if they would have progressed the anime to the championships.\\n\\n\r\nIts not the classic sports animes, but if your looking for something related it's worth watching.\\n\\n\\n",

T\u014da Tokuchi, a man whose genius is comparable to Akagi (it's an anime for all you cartoon network fed morons) that was a part of a gambling ring. In the beginning, he is a pitcher in a street baseball game called One Outs. The gist of it all is that he is this actually pretty par pitcher, but he is very good at tapping into the mind of his opponents and simply mind-fucking them to smithereens. Some baseball players from a low-ranking teamhear about him and make an attempt to try there skills against him. Through some interesting bets, Tokuchi, becomes contracted with that team. His contract is different from other players in that, his salary increases by 5,000,000 yen for every out he makes,and lose 50,000,000 yen of point he gives up.\\n\\n\r\n     This anime was more like a 7 or a 6.5. I really enjoyed all the mind games played. Humor in it wasn't super excellent or prominent, but then again it is more like the anime Akagi. If you enjoyed that, you will like this one, too. I don't really like baseball, but One Outs really made me enjoy it. This rating is kind of low one the account of watching so many mind game related anime before hand. Not to say it is a copy with a story change, it simply wasn't ground breaking, like how say Death Note  ( Fucking spectacular) was.",

It's really wonderful to watch how cruel this guy can be and by the way he earns tons of money...\\n\\n\r\nAnd of course there are his slaves^^ Who are kinda really naive and stupid but with the right words they are all deceived by Tokuchi. it's really fun to watch even the managers, players etc. being all arrogant and than crushed. \\n\\n\r\nSo anyone who's into animes with characters like : Alucard, Light, Hiruma \\n\r\nis welcomed to watch this and even those who are not really into sports animes could enjoy this.",
