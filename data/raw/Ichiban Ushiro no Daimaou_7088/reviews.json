            "content": "\"That's why I decided not to think about anything anymore!\"\r\nThat's a good one-line summary of this anime taken straight from the last episode. It's safe to say that the enjoyment of this anime is inversely proportional to the amount of plot stuffed into one episode. Simply, the more plot, the less fun. Ichiban is a harem anime. That means it doesn't exist to cater to the brain, and it doesn't. You should be aware that if you're going to watch this anime, then you're watching it for a good laugh, a small smirk, and moments where you can go \"Oh Japan!\" and laugh at whatmakes it onto millions of TV sets across seas. You will like the fight scenes, and you will never learn the characters names - you will refer to them by hair color.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5/10\\n\r\nThe demon lord, 100 years ago, tried to destroy humanity. The demon lord was killed and peace resumed, and up until our story begins, nothing as terrible has happened since then. Here our protagonist is introduced, Sai Akuto. His goal is be someone of great authority who will lead people to lead righteous lives (the anime alludes to the Pope). He then meets Hattori Junko, or \"the Blue one\", and she and Sai hit it off and look like they're going to be great friends. Then a tweest. Sai Akuto is designated by the sorting hat, I mean, the Yata-Garasu, as the future demon lord! Oh no! Blue gets mad, challenges Sai to a duel, then tsundere love kicks into effect and then a robot (Green) comes out of nowhere and an invisible girl gets fingered (Red) all in one episode! Actually, the exposition was pretty awesome and I really enjoyed it... But... It is safe to say, that the plot of the anime was almost nil after the first episode. Eventually we have incestuous sibling love, the power rangers, ninja idols, time travel, pseudo-space and all other kinds of crazy stuff coming into the anime. I understand it's anime about magic where 'anything could happen because we are led into a mysterious world whose limits are not ever revealed' but I would like at least some boundaries. When the mysterious man who is awkwardly introduced tried to rape numerous protagonists with giant sea cucumbers, I could safely say that I no longer took the plot seriously. But that's okay. It's a harem.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThink Gurren Lagann fight scenes. Then turn it down a little bit and make sure that there is a lot more OVER 9000 and laser beams and is sped up about fourteen times. You now have a good idea about what fight scenes in Ichiban are like. Animation is superb, art is a little different. The art for me was a little too generic. It felt kind of like fluidity and motion were really nice but left more to desire when someone wasn't kicking ass. If you were to compare this to numerous other harem anime, it just doesn't seem to be much different visually. But that's okay. It has cool fight scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nAki Toysaki does a really awesome job as Soga Keena (Red), but if you don't like her then I recommend turning the volume off, she gets a LOT of screen time, and talks a crap load. Aoi Yuuki (who voiced Mina Tepes from Vampire Bund and Noel from Sora no Woto) had a great voice too. She voiced a monotone character, but did a really job making it sound \"not as monotone.\"  I really had no affection toward the OP or the ED. But that's okay. They suited a harem anime very well, and maybe you'll like them because music is a developed taste.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\r\nI don't know whether to give this a 1 for about a million bland characters, or a 10 for Peterhausen the dragon who shoots fiery drills. The main cast is a pallet of fun (rimshot). Everyone is a different hair color and a different \"dere\" so they're easy to tell apart! That's where the harem anime has the most trouble in my opinion. A harem has set archetypal characters and refuses to create an original endearing woman. I'm not saying that any woman in this anime is poorly written. Each one is written with her character in mind, but never strays from what the textbook says. Red is an airhead, Etou (Purple) is masochist, Blue is tsundere, and Green is emotionless. All of them can be summed up in one word. \\n\\n\r\nSai Akuto is on the other hand, a very interesting character. The setting continually sets him up to be a bad guy, but somehow he always manages to do the right thing, whether people know he's doing it or not. The typical male protagonist in a harem always tries to avoid temptation, but without a clear motive as to why. For example, for some craaaazy reason one of the beautiful ladies has appeared in front of our protagonist naked.Our protagonist, who very often envisions this event happening, suddenly has an over-powering urge to avoid any sexually conduct with this woman. BUT WHY? She's beautiful, naked, and right freaking in front of you! This creates character inconsistencies, but where our protagonist differs, is that when he refuses the woman (which alas he does), he is still in character. In summary, Sai Akuto is a good guy, and no one can tell him otherwise. I like that. As for the rest of the other characters, they're nothing special. But that's okay. Sai is a really cool character you'll love to see on screen, and to boot he isn't a sissy wimp like a lot of other harem protagonists!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nEven with so many things working against this anime, there are so many moments where you'll seriously just laugh. I enjoyed a great portion of this anime. The only problem I really had was with the plot. But that's definitely okay! I remembered that it was a harem anime and anyone who forgets this key factor should try to understand that a little bit of mindless humor is good once in a while.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\r\nIchiban is not a memorable anime. It really has nothing worth remembering (except Peterhausen). It just follows a long line of other harem anime into oblivion. But hey, it's only 12 episodes, and it's a fun little anime. I'd say it's worth recommending, but not worth ask feedback on. The response you'll get will be \"Well... It was a harem anime... I liked 'X female'\" so on and etc.\\n\\n\r\nBut that's okay. Because it IS a harem anime and expecting anything more than that is just plain craziness.",

            "content": "Is it just me, or is the playback rate at 200%?\r\n'Ichiban Ushiro no Daimaou (The Great Demon King in the Very Back)' is set in an elite magic school where aspiring magicians learn to control their mana. The initial setting is very similar to 'To Aru Majutsu no Index'. One day, a transfer student (Akuto Sai) arrives. New students are required to go through an analysis by the \"artificial spirit\", which predicts future occupation with 100% accuracy. Surprisingly, the artificial spirit predicts Akuto will become the next Demon King. Once dreamed of becoming the High Priest, Akuto must spend his school life with the burdenof becoming the ultimate evil while his true powers awaken, going through one misunderstanding after another.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nI actually found the original setting to be very intriguing. My impression after the first two episodes were... it's good enough that it didn't even have to be ecchi. The setting itself had the fantasy, opportunity for interesting story development, and possible obstacles all built in. It even had a super cool background where Akuto's self-introduction sounded like the real demon king that appeared 100 year ago.\\n\\n\r\nI haven't read the light novel or the manga series, but from the anime, it seems like the title \"The Great Demon King in the Very Back\" comes from the fact that Akuto was given the seat in the very last row of his classroom. Sadly, the title of this anime series foreshadowed the pattern of story development... You would think Akuto will slowly become a dark presence in the back of his classroom while he tries to clear all the misunderstandings right? Think again. If I'm not mistaken, he hasn't sat in his seat since episode two. And so, the story jumped from one direction to another, random new organizations and villains appeared out of nowhere, and it eventually became mindless fights before the series ended, leaving me completely clueless. It actually got so bad at one point that Akuto threw a monster egg out of a window during breakfast, and the next cut was the crew outside at night in front of the monster egg, which grew exponentially. Really, it's one of those \u7a81\u3063\u8fbc\u307f\u6240\u304c\u591a\u3059\u304e\u3066 \"I don't know where I should begin pointing out the flaws\".\\n\\n\r\nJust like that monster egg, the story seemed to have an exponential acceleration in terms of pacing. The first two episodes had good pacing as introduction of the surroundings. Up until episode 7 was fast paced, but acceptable for slapstick comedy, but the final 5 episodes were packed with random events and explanations that seemed to go on and on without giving the audience time to absorb the story. The characters in the latter half actually started verbally describing the situation, and it wasn't even a deliberate slapstick joke.\\n\\n\r\nI have to say the ecchi element was applied very effectively in this series though. Sometimes ecchi scenes were forced, like repetitive explosions stripping Junko or Keina getting naked every time she becomes transparent, but somehow they were funny every single time. Other ones happen more spontaneously, from skirts too short and creative camera angles that seem to focus on their panties. If there was a cameraman for this show, he was a major perv. This show is probably the closest to hentai category as an under-18 show can possibly get. It goes as far as giving a sea cucumber hand job until it squirts sticky white goo on another girl's face in a certain episode, and \"classic tentacle hold\" (you know the one I'm talking about if you've even seen an action hentai series) where one tentacle almost goes all the way in.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, the story was a mess, and there were way too many loose ends and question marks unanswered.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nExtremely inconsistent.\\n\r\nThe character designs are very good. Akuto has the obvious \"mark of the Demon King\" below his eye, but it keeps his appearance somewhat original, and he has that cool look and badass confidence that will eventually attract all the girls and create his harem. The girls are all hot, and there were abundance of fan service. Action scenes are pretty cool, and early episodes had really nice CG effects with magic circles and spectacular spells.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, they try to be \"So bad it's actually good\" with Brave and villains similar to something out of \"Needless\" or even \"Scryed\" about half way, and fails miserably. Monsters attracted by Akuto's powers looked like they're from late '90s demon hentai anime.\\n\r\nPerhaps it was caused by deadlines or budget, the animation quality noticeably degrades as the show go on.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nVoice acting is decent. All the characters sound like they should, and none particularly annoying. Considering the (presumably) low budget they had, they gathered a decent cast as voice actors.\\n\r\nMusic score is disastrous. Although none of the pieces were out of place, the back ground music completely lack originality, and made absolutely no impact to the viewing experience.\\n\r\nOP/ED were average. They fit the series pretty well, but not especially catchy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nAll the main characters were extremely likable, and had unique backgrounds. However, very few of them actually developed as the show had hazardous pacing problems. Junko remained an archetype tsundere to the end, and Fujiko was a SM queen who we don't know if she was a \"S\" personality who wanted to control Akuto or a \"M\" personality who wanted to serve under him. I feel Akuto and his henchman Hiroshi were somewhat well-developed, but the pacing made it impossible to pursue such deep issues such as responsibility, justice, morality, and all those things they wanted to explore.\\n\\n\r\nI really liked Korone's character. An android with sense of humor done right is rare, and the character developed as much as an android could in a 12-episode-long series. She was also a very effective comedic device, and I liked how she gave Akuto the hardest time with her sexual approaches.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall:\\n\r\n'Ichiban Ushiro no Daimaou' had a great potential to become something special. The show started out pretty strong, and had the slapstick comedy seemed to be working at first, but it was a downward spiral from there. As mentioned many times before, the pacing is far too fast, even for a slapstick comedy series. They tried to pack 20 episodes worth of material into a 12-episode, 1-season long series. Everything seemed to be twice as fast as they should be. I tend to read subtitle as future reference for fansubbing, but I gave up halfway because the characters were babbling nonsense at an absurd rate. Also, if you blank out for 3 seconds, chances are you missed an important explanation of the plot, a cool action scene, or even worse, a panchira.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps it would've been better if they added some more material and extended to a 2-season long series, but then again, it would've been even longer painful viewing experience unless they made major modifications to the story. Despite the worthless production value of this show, it's an enjoyable series if you shut down half of your brain because the characters had the charm and it offers good laughs from many ecchi jokes and misunderstandings Akuto had gone through in the first half of the series.\\n\\n\r\nI feel the major problem was that 'Ichiban Ushiro no Daimaou' tried to be too many things. There was ecchi, comedy, drama, and tried to tackle the issue of right and wrong. The producers should've simply made it an 12-episode long ecchi-driven slapstick comedy, or 25-episode long action drama with a philosophical touch. Not both.",

            "content": "I started watching this the first week it was aired, so I was following most of this as it was being subbed, apart from the last 4 episodes which I burst through this evening by force.\r\nThis anime starts off very strong in my opinion, it is funny, it is reasonably paced, the characters are interesting, and although there are hints of being slightly generic on occassion in the first few episodes, I dismissed them as everything else was great.\r\nThe intro hooks you as it starts out at a train station, the main protagonist Sai Akuto is getting on the train to his new school withhopes of becoming a priest, how wrong his hopes will turn out to be though.\\n\\n\r\nImmediately he meets with one of the female heroines, and gets off to a rocky start, which is quickly remedied, and they quickly become friends, and from that introduction easing you in, it starts throwing scraps of the main plot at you, mixed in with interesting characters and lots of funny moments to keep you interested, it seemed so perfect at first, to me at least, as everything was right, everything fit, it seemed great and I couldn't say a bad word about it.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character was likeable, he wasn't a stale, brown haired with glasses \"I want to always do the right thing nothing else matters I won't hurt people but I don't want to die\" clich\u00e9 piece of rubbish we've seen a million times. He was a unique character, interesting, likeable. He wasn't afraid to stand up, to get in a fight where necessary, but he tried to avoid it otherwise in a reasonable fashion, a simple first hurdle that so many protagonists in this kind of genre fail at and which anger me every time.\\n\\n\r\nThe female heroines had some generic stereotypes thrown in here and there, but overall were a solid set of characters, all unique and different, with different motives for being with the protagonist, different goals in mind, all drawn to him and all playing an important part to the main plot evenly, no girl is completely left out.\\n\r\nOn a personal side note I absolutely adored the robot girl and student council president. Especially the president, my lord she was brilliant.\\n\r\nThe other 'throwaway' side characters as I like to call them aren't annoying, they're reasonably likeable, they do their job well and don't feel forced.\\n\r\nOverall the cast was very solid and worked together well.\\n\\n\r\nThe main problem with this series though, is that it starts to rush things.\\n\r\nREALLY rush things, and it loses a lot of it's charm, especially around the middle sections to near the end.\\n\\n\r\nBefore you know it, everything has been introduced for a base to build the main plot on, then suddenly the main plot kicks into overdrive and you're left sitting with your head cocked to one side, confused as to where this all of a sudden came from, who these new people are, what is actually going on. Especially in the build up to the last few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nIt was obvious that they had to cram a lot together in the 12 episodes, and it would have been much better as a 24 episode series in my honest opinion, as a lot of it was explained in a rather backhanded manner, \"Oh, by the way, x is now x of so and so and does this, this is what is the cause of that, understand what's going on now? no? me either.\", at least that is how it felt to me at times.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing to note though, when the main serious plot does kick in, while the jokes don't completely dissipate; they are toned down. A lot.\\n\r\nThere are probably more jokes and hilarious moments in a single early episode than there is in the last 5.\\n\\n\r\nAnother gripe is how it seems to almost change genre episode 5+, at times it suddenly gets rather cheesy, with fighting and action scenes that I can only describe as \"a mix between dragonball z and naruto\" in some cases, especially the sword in the stone bit, I won't spoil, but that seemed too ludicrous for me to handle.\\n\\n\r\nIt almost feels as if it can't decide what it would prefer to do, stick with the way it started in the first few episodes, or switch to a generic fighting anime style, it hovers in-between and it aggravated me somewhat.\\n\\n\r\nDespite it's flaws, and in my opinion becoming very generic and average in the middle areas, the late areas redeemed themselves, with the final two episodes being genuinely enjoyable again, although the ending felt like a slight cop-out to me, it was still enjoyable, so if you do watch, be warned that you might have to force yourself to watch some episodes near the middle.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, enough with explaining the story, characters and my enjoyment of it, onto the art and sound.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was very good, the animation was done to a reasonably good standard, neither were anything to go crazy about, but they were good.\\n\r\nMost of the characters had unique visual properties  (I say most) that define them and make them unique, so for the most part there are no copypasted characters, the main protagonist is definitely unique, and in a very good way.\\n\r\nI never found any glaring faults with things like anatomy or the way characters move, which is always a good thing, oh, and I watched it uncensored so I cannot comment on how the censorship was done, sorry there.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIn regards to sound, the OP was very nice, I liked it a lot in terms of both the animation and the music, the ED was alright too, but I wasn't a huge fan.\\n\r\nThe music in the actual anime wasn't really that memorable except in one or two sections, so it is a solid 5-6 on that front, but I liked the voice acting a lot, so that bumps it up to an 8.\\n\r\nThe voice actors were very good in my opinion, they conveyed the emotions, reactions and feelings well, I can't say anything bad about them.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, it gets a 7 in my opinion, it was honestly enjoyable, but it rushed too much and felt like it couldn't decide what it wanted to be as an anime.\\n\r\nIt could have been so much more.\\n\\n\r\nStill, I would recommend fans of the comedy/supernatural genre give it a try as it is a good all rounder still, I just don't see it getting any special mention or being considered \"amazing\" any time soon.",

            "content": "I have noticed, in recent years, the shift away from the straight ecchi harem, and I can't complain. The action-romance-harem is much more enjoyable, and is a far better investment when it comes to time spent watching anime. So, when I saw this series, I had hope. And, throughout the first six or seven episodes, I thought that my hope had been realized. But, by episode ten, I have realized that I was premature in that judgment. This anime does a lot right, and is probably worth of a watch, but it is no masterpiece, and suffers from some major flaws, particularly in regards toit's over structure and the way it's story plays out.\\n\\n\r\nWARNING: There are some spoilers in this review. They aren't super huge, and you kinda see them coming in the series anyway, but whatever. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 6 fair* \\n\r\n*Really it should be \"story for eps 1-6 is an 8 or 9; story for episode 7 on is a 4\"\\n\\n\r\nThis is a \"magic functions along with science in and alternate modern day or near future\" kind of universe, much like Zero no tsukaima or Maburaho. As I watched, I realized it was amongst the best of these type of anime. The characters work nice together and are consistent in their behavior, so that once you accept the premise you don't find yourself having to suspend your disbelief too much. Now, that's not to say there isn't some silliness, but it works. Also, the idea for the story is a very interesting one. THE MAJOR PROBLEM IS, it moves too fast. This is not a 12 episode series. This is a twenty four episode series crammed into twelve. As a result, they sacrifice character building (though they manage an admirable job within their limits) and world building (which is the one that really suffers) to fit everything in. Unfortunately, this means that there are characters, like the headmaster, or the teacher, who you don't really care much about and who don't seem to fit in the story. The central characters could really use more time together, letting us get to know them and invest in their well being.\\n\\n\r\nInstead the story pacing is like that girl who you like, and have a good first and second date with, but now she is having some major financial problem and demands your aid even though you've only really known her a week and a half. You're torn, because you know it could have developed into something good if you'd have just had more time, but now she's asking too much too soon, and you really just wanna back off a bit.\\n\\n\r\nSPOILER FOLLOWING\\n\r\nAlso, I have major problems with the content of the story. Like the fact that it's an entirely unsubtle atheist rant, with some humanist overtones. The whole, \"I'm going to destroy God\" and the \"God is just a system that human came up with to justify war and inequality they want to enforce, so it's bad and evil\" and all that is just so unnecessary. In the story world, \"God\" is a giant evil computer that's not really well explained at all, and is somehow blamed for some of the bad stuff that is happening to the main characters. The story would be so much better if they had left that out, or at least not attached religious names and iconography to the computer system and the magic officials. The atheist message would have been an implicit, potential reading, but it would completely and suddenly alienate people of faith, like myself. \\n\r\nAlso, it is so thematically weak because of what it does. In the story universe, there is no God literally is a created machine that people have illogically deified. In the real world, the existence of God is, at the very least, debatable. I don't want to make religious arguments here, but what I'm saying is, I want the God computer destroyed because it seems evil, but I've not been influenced in my opinions relating to God in the real world at all, because they are two totally different things that have only been connected by the author's choice to use the same name. \\n\\n\r\nIt's just dumb. I hate it when heavy handed, talentless hacks with an axe to grind ruin what was shaping up to be an interesting story with unnecessary, foundationally weak preaching, because they don't know how to show the audience something, only how to tell them.\\n\r\nEND SPOILER\\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, there are some mild inconsistencies int he main character's actions, the background behind the major conflict, that is the \"why are they even doing this\" is never really discussed, the major villain appears with minimal warning and development, and the pacing goes from  0 to 60 and then back, so you're never sure whether it's a side story or the main story until you're already in it.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the main character's powers develop a bit too fast. That's one of the reasons they should have spent longer on the series. He seems to spontaneously become the master of all magic, even though he is only barely learning and has minimal control at the beginning. They could have made him a super powerful badass, they should have just don so more gradually. Showing him fight some of the student as the disciplinary guy, or a learning montage of him in school getting better, would have easily satisfied this and made the passage of time feel a bit less rapid. Also, some time references, like \"it's already been x months since you came!\" and such.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9 great\\n\r\nReally well animated. The character designs are nothing ground breaking and new, but originality does not mean quality. These characters fit their voices and personalities, the combat (especially) is well done, and pretty well choreographed, there aren't that many continuity problems with the animation from cut to cut, and the even the fan-service is drawn particularly well. Usually I don't much care for fan service at all, especially when it distracts from the story, and there are some instances it does in this anime, but they are far fewer than is the standard for harem series, and it is well done when it occurs, so I don't over penalize it. So, yeah, for nothing something that's already been done really well, you still get a gold star.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7 good\\n\r\nThe opening is fitting and catchy, a good choice. The foley and background music is unobtrusive, doesn't really stand out. Once again, it's nothing amazing, like the full orchestral scores they do for one piece, or the edgy synthesized instrumental/industrial style stuff they use in Bleach, but it's well done enough that it contributes a bit to the story atmosphere rather than detracting. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8 very good\\n\r\nThe main character, unlike in Zero no Tsukaima, is not such a ridiculous pervert that you hate him for it; nor is he weak, limited and indecisive, like in Maburaho. He's actually one of the few harem main characters that I really like. He's generally consistent and a good guy, if a bit on the ruthless side at times (which I don't have a problem with.) What bother me is the feeling of inconsistency I get from him. \\n\\n\r\nSPOILER: A perfect example is that he is very willing to maim and torture the delinquents who attack him ruthlessly, but won't allow Brave to kill the creepy old man with the noise coat. This particular choice makes no sense. He should, frankly, not have a problem. In fact, the entire conflict constructed between him and Brave is a major story weakness, as it highlights major inconsistencies in their  characters actions.\\n\r\nEND SPOILER\\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, the female characters are fairly well developed, I felt, particularly the android observer and the blue haired ninja girl, who are the two I like best anyway. That's not to say it wouldn't have been better to get to know them a bit better, and to let the main character's relationship develop a bit further with the two primary potential love interests (blue haired ninja and red haired bimbo), but I was accepting.\\n\\n\r\n(The red haired, airhead bimbo will hopefully not be the one chosen as the end of story romantic interest finally. I am so freakin tired of the dang japanese and their stupid \"many girls, but who do I choose?\"romance anime where the protagonist passes over the awesome, empowered, self sufficient, tsundere female for the retarded, airheaded, naive redheaded(or pink haired) idiot.)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6 fair\\n\r\nSo, overall, my enjoyment was greatly lessened by the fact that it could have been such a better series if they'd have just let it go 24 episodes, and also hired a decent writer to reword the latter half of the series. A bit more character development, beefing up the story world early on so it doesn't fee like they are just making it up as they go to be able to create the final conflict, and a lack of atheist ranting would have greatly increased my enjoyment. I don't know what the final two episodes will hold, and hope that they can change my opinion, but I doubt they will.\\n\\n\r\nThus, overall it was good(7), but it could have been great. It didn't suffer some of the debilitating flaws that many other series like it did, but it still could have used tweaking and lengthening.\\n\\n\r\nHope this review was helpful, if not thought provoking.\\n\r\nRespectfully,\\n\r\n~Daemonblade1229\\n\\n\r\nP.S.\\n\r\nApologies for any spelling errors, but it is rather late. I'll likely tweak it someday, but I leave for 9 weeks of living in the forest soon (I work summers at a Boy Scout camp), so I won't have internet. That's also why i won't be able to see the last two eps until the fall. We all make sacrifices...\\n\\n",

(I do hope the rest of the episodes will be similar to the first)\r\nFor those who love magic, superpowers, and battles (like me), this will be a great anime to watch as the first episode already shows the style and power of magic that is going to be used. (Energy large enough to destroy a small field) \r\nStory & Character (9/10):\r\nIt isinteresting how the main character tries to clear misunderstandings, but they just get worse off. He is labelled as the demon king by the system and he criticizes the system while trying to reject it and makes his own life worse. The same thing happens with a girl he is trying to impress. This adds the humor element to the story.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10/10):\\n\r\nThis anime does have some ecchi feature so be warned (If you hate ecchi please just don't rate it just on that. The introduction to the story line is great.) The scenery is very realistic and magic is imbued on top of weapons very nicely.",

            "content": "Usually, when I start up a harem/ecchi anime, I prepare myself for the onslaught of nonsensical breasts, sporadic panty shots, illogical physics and random facesitting. These are the basics, and anyone who has watched more than one ecchi knows that this is a common theme in all of them. \r\nAnd of course, naturally, these people don't go too hard on the show because \"it comes with the genre,\" and \"you have to look at it as a harem/ecchi.\" \r\nI disagree.\r\nThere is a fundamental problem with ecchi anime that goes overboard. For an anime to be considered a good work, it needs to accomplish things suchas thematic development and effective symbolism, amongst other things, although there are a few exceptions. There are, for sure, aspects such as art and sound that come into play when judging an anime, but when we consider the big picture, that is, the overall score, art and sound comprise 40% of it, while another 40% goes to story and characters, and 20% to enjoyment. Ecchi comes short when trying to develop the story and characters because of its various sexual moments. When an anime uses up screen-time to show these scenes, it loses time to develop the story and characters. In moderate amounts, you could argue for character development, for example, by demonstrating a certain character to be attractive, which may be an integral part to his/her character, but in most cases, you do not need her to jiggle her breasts ten times within the first five minutes to get that point across. When you constantly do this, you lose out in certain areas, which inevitably makes the anime lose points overall.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, Ichiban Ushiro no Daimaou is a stellar example of this phenomenon. The show is, and although I have no hard data to really prove this, half ecchi (and you might as well call some of that \"ecchi,\" hentai). I mean, quite literally, if the show is twelve episodes, and we do the math, that's 4.6 hours. I would go as far as saying that a good 2.3 hours of that time is devoted to some sort of ecchi. When half of your show is ecchi, you will inevitably lose out on the story and character sections. Thus, my ratings for those sections are considerably low. The art and sound are not impacted by this, and that would explain my rather high score for the show's art (I'll explain my sound rating later). Enjoyment is entirely dependent on the individual, and I care quite a bit about story and characters so my score for that is quite low too.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the specifics.\\n\r\n(I MAY HAVE SLIGHT SPOILERS)\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\r\nIchiban Ushiro no Daimaou's story is nothing to praise. To provide a light synopsis for use in this review, the protagonist is supposedly a demon king and the show attempts to produce some sort of message about free thought and goodness through some morally gray situations. However, it is clear that the writers did not understand what the color gray looks like, because what I saw was pure black and pure white. The story is plagued by a lot of typical shounen moments and decisions that have had clear \"right,\" answers. I was not for a second challenged with a question that I found to be considerably controversial. Not to mention, the way the story ends so idyllically ends up toppling whatever the writers accomplished, so even giving points for their attempt is difficult.\\n\\n\r\nThe story also suffers from a lightweight feeling. For example, a lot of things in the story do not have much of a backstory to provide support. Why is the protagonist a demon lord again? Was there any meaning in his status as one? Or what about his rival? What about him? Where did his powers come from? And what is with the convenient arrival thereof? A lot of unexplained questions lead to a lack of weight and the story loses a lot of points in this regard. What about the mystical magic all-powerful sword? It is given, (along with a little trope-tag of \"it'll work when you need it to) yet the weight of this particular weapon weighs more than the entire story. \\n\\n\r\nThe inclusion of random characters is also everpresent in Ichiban Ushiro no Daimaou, although it is to be expected from a typical harem that tries to squeeze in the entire world's population's C cup and above girls into a one mile radius within one day. However, compared to a show like Clannad, where the girls are actually people and not toys for the main character, Ichiban Ushiro no Daimaou prefers to toss all sorts of spices in hoping one of them tastes well to the viewer. The fanservice involving these randomly tossed in characters inundates the viewer. It seemed to me that if there was an explosion, it was ingeniously rigged to blow up in just the perfect manner so as to rip the girls' clothes to shreds but leave their perfect skin and breasts untouched. Can't have bad complexion, now can we?\\n\\n\r\nThere are also some aspects of the story that just seem absolutely childish and idiotic. And for a show like this, where it goes as far as showing off some of the characters nipples (and this is why some may consider this almost a hentai), it clearly is not aimed at children. An ancient slumbering dragon is actually a robotic machination that shoots missiles and hacks computers that the God(s) use to interact with reality is a blasphemous concept. A girl who likes to masturbate in front of her brother's still-alive, preserved head and fantasizing about an evil demon lord? Did they originally attempt for a hentai plot but then forget about it? This sort of consistent foolishness would be acceptable if the show was some sort parody but it is not, and it is simply unnecessary and takes away too much attention from the story's attempts at thematic development (of which there is so little I will not even expand). \\n\\n\r\nThe story is also plagued with a lot of outrageous ecchi elements and tools that become almost intrusive, and at best, laughable. Our little Meena can go invisible, but somehow she hasn't studied magic enough to apply it to her clothing, so she has to go naked. Junko has a habit of only ripping her torso clean off. And Korone has a cute little tail that you need to pull to turn her off. Make sure to get a firm grip boys!\\n\\n\r\nOverall, combined with generic and overused characters, the story is one of the more unoriginal things I've seen. Especially speaking of the backstory elements.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a few merits though that I must give to the story. The attempt is something I consider to be worthy of some points, since I think it is something that isn't found very often in the show's genre. The story is also pretty decent at building up some sort of tension, which is also nice to have. But the merits here are few, and are overwhelmed by the many blemishes.\\n\\n\r\nI give the story a 3.\\n\\n\r\nART\\n\r\nThe art, which also includes animation for me, was actually pretty rock solid. The fighting scenes were well drawn and had great and flashy physics. The scenes also seemed to be running at a great frame rate or had some apt motion blur, or both. A lot of times I could really get into the fight scenes since they looked captivating. They were smooth, cool and sometimes just simply awesome. The characters were for the most part also well drawn (with the exclusion of Hiroshi, who I thought just looked ridiculous). And I'll even go far as saying that those breasts looked great. Really though, the few men there were in this show (as it is a harem) were pretty well drawn and the artists put apt attention to important details and aspects of them, like the protagonist's unique eyes and toned body, or the cocky hair of Bouichirou, the man who challenged the Gods. I would have given it something closer to a 9 if it weren't for some bad inconsistency and coarseness with casual scenes, and the usage of pretty generic and crazy anime hair (although this part is mostly a preference).\\n\\n\r\nI give the art an 8. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\r\nThere's not much to say here since the sound didn't really catch me whatsoever. I was never really captured by moving music in highly emotional parts of the show, or drawn to the screen during a bass filled drum-crazy fight theme, nor was I ever relaxed as I watched characters being casual with a smooth walking theme playing in the background. I do not, for the life of me, actually remember anything slightly noteworthy about the sound. If anything, I remember the OP having awkward and nonsensical lyrics. Overall, nothing amazing here, and since the soundtrack of a show is designed to heighten moments and keep it alive, Ichiban Ushiro no Daimaou fails terribly. \\n\\n\r\nI give the sound a 4. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\r\nI have probably already developed on my critique of the characters in my story section, but regardless, there's much to say here.\\n\\n\r\nNow, granted, since Ichiban Ushiro no Daimaou is a harem, the character quality would decline, and just because it is a harem does not mean all of a sudden you should give it a 6 (Fair). Ichiban Ushiro no Daimaou suffers from what I already described as the harem-character problem, where an interminable stream of characters (usually very attractive and sexualized girls) are shot into the show with little to no justification whatsoever, and this already destroys the score for the show. The characters become lifeless eye candy. You don't remember these characters by their names or by their achievements or by their struggles or their personality, but you remember them by their cup size, hip-waist ratio, and hair color. Oh, and I guess the sexually relevant traits are included too (I like the one who's all shy and doesn't want to have sex but clearly does!!!, etc.).\\n\\n\r\nIchiban Ushiro no Daimaou also has some of the most heavy trope-elements in it, regarding characters, that I've ever seen. Every character in the show is some clear manifestation of some trope. Here are some examples (mind the spoilers, or skip):\\n\\n\r\nKorone: Silent and smart hot girl that doesn't understand the meaning of sexual tact. Also has a conveniently placed off switch in the form of a fuzzy bunny-ball tail. \\n\r\nJunko: Active, tough and independent woman with a soft side for protagonist.\\n\r\nKeena: Onii-chan!!!\\n\r\nMitsuko: Hot teacher with a deep compassion for her students. You can interpret compassion in whatever way you want. Wink.\\n\r\nHiroshi: Dependent young brother that fights for his big bro and becomes powerful. For the yaoi fans out there.\\n\r\n(By the way, I read somewhere that when they were auditioning for the characters, they demanded a cup size of C or above from the ladies.)\\n\\n\r\nI don't particularly hate tropes, they will always be present and you could argue that without tropes there would be no such thing as genres. But tropes can become intrusive when used to such great extent and absolutely demolishes the originality factor. Ichiban Ushiro no Daimaou's cast is a chaotic blend of all sorts of harem/ecchi-suited tropes that provide no sort of unique or refreshing feel whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters also are very two dimensional. Fujiko's little back-story for example is an overused vengeance plot and she overcomes this predicament with such ease and expediency that you really wonder if there was even a point of using that episode for that \"development,\" when they could have just thrown more bare chested Junko at us. At least then, I could have used my imagination, and thus my brain, a bit more. Their back-stories are also, just like their character models, tropes. \\n\\n\r\nWell, at least they look hot. Kind of.\\n\\n\r\nI give the characters a 2.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\r\nThe enjoyment value for this show, for me was pretty low, but is subject to change depending on who is watching it, since I know some people who love ecchi, and others who despise it. \\n\\n\r\nI personally am quite impartial with ecchi, and I am confident that my score for this area is unbiased, or at least, as unbiased as a score for a category named \"enjoyment,\" can be. The enjoyment was low because of the low scores the show receives in all other areas. Simply speaking, I personally do not enjoy bad shows very much. \\n\\n\r\nA lot of the enjoyment points were torn off due to ridiculous and outrageous scenes and unexplained and unanswered questions, all resulting in a slight bit of frustration and definitely a lack of joy. Such as the awkward and unjustified ecchi/almost hentai scenes that usually just made me uncomfortable and not enticed whatsoever. The characters were also too shallow for me to develop real connections and love for any of them, and the sound never heightened my feelings or emotions when watching so as to imprint a positive impression. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, the show is given the genre of \"comedy,\" but it wasn't often that I laughed. There was one or two times where I did smile at a well written dialogue, but it wasn't nearly as often as I should have for my enjoyment factor to rise at all. The show also is classified under a handful of other genres that it all smashed into twelve episodes, leaving me unsatisfied and overstuffed. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the art did help the enjoyment factor a bit (and as expected, I gave it a very high score). The fight scenes, like I have said before, were well detailed and smooth, and I highly enjoyed watching a good punch in the antagonist's face or a vibrant ball of mana/energy being flung across the battlefield, or a dragon flying through the stratosphere. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\r\n4.4 --> 4.\\n\\n\r\nLAST WORDS\\n\r\nIchiban Ushiro no Daimaou is, well, a harem ecchi and you really shouldn't expect any more than just that, and this mentality should be used for essentially every harem/ecchi you run into. You shouldn't run into this show expecting glory, but you shouldn't raise its score just because it chose to give up 40% of the overall score's value.\\n\\n\r\nSeeing my score, I wouldn't recommend this show to anyone unless someone was specifically asking for ecchi, in which case, this cool show shows you a girl masturbating, some fine breasts in their full glory at high resolution and many other unsavory/pleasurable (you decide) things. \\n\\n\r\nAs I like to say:\\n\\n\r\n\"Only in anime.\"\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "***May contain spoilers*** Usually I wouldnt do a review if I agree with the current reviews, but I just HAD to express my opinions on this anime.\r\nTo start, the anime was quite interesting for the first few episodes. I'm not really a fan of the harem genre, but i really liked that the MC seemed to be quite badass and have lots of power. \r\nHowever, the entire concept of \"Brave\" felt super, super stupid and out of place. What a hypocrite. Weak, and given power just because of a suit created by someone else. The \"Hero\" was really lame - the suit looked stupid, andhe was really going against his 'Aniki' all along. I dont get why the MC apologized to the 'Brave' guy at the end cause really it should be the other way around. Brave could've killed the MC and not only that, but went insane for a stupid girl who he barely knew/was an idol who wouldnt even give the Demon King a chance to explain himself or anything.\\n\\n\r\nThe last several episodes were wayyy to rushed. They escalated waayyyy to quickly. So many times I had no idea which side the characters were on, and it felt pretty stupid overall - like this anime tries to have too much going on and fails miserably with it. \\n\\n\r\nSo, overall, I think giving a rating of 5 is being extremely kind. Like i said, pretty decent and interesting beginning, only to get really lame in the middle and utterly stupid by the end. Waste of your time and wouldnt recommend watching it.",

This show is a comedy ecchi really funny, so if you can't stand a little bit of boobs, this anime is not for you. Here is a little introduction :\r\nSai Akuto is a teen who dream to become a Priest, a man with high qualities. He decide to enter a MagicHighschool. On the road in the train, he swear friendship with another student : Hattori Junko. Arrived at school, he passes a medical examination with a special bird which can predict his future occupation. It predicts a future to the exact opposite of what he dreamed, he is destined to become the King Demons.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 7\\n\r\nThat's the worst part of the anime, the first episode made me remind of Harry Potter, It felt like 'deja vu', that's why i gave a 7.\\n\r\nArt - 8\\n\r\nGreat art, nothing to say more, i really liked it, but i think it depends on people.\\n\r\nSound - 8\\n\r\nSounds was Ok, the opening is good, ending ok. During the show it's not a masterwork, but good enough to keep you watching.\\n\r\nCharacter - 10\\n\r\nEvery character have his own personnality, unusual personality, that's what i like ! Sai Akuto attracts lots of troubles because of the fact that he is destined to become a king demon. \\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10 \\n\r\nThat's just the funniest anime that i saw in my life ! Full of misunderstandings, embarrasing situation and comics scenes.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, I recommend this anime that will give you a huge enjoyment and a lot of laughs.",

            "content": "Welcome to a magic school that places you based on what you will be after graduating. One boy has been chosen one and was left on the doorstep to be token care of\u2026 welcome to the world of Harry Potter\u2026 er\u2026 I mean Demon King Daimao. But in all seriousness, this show starts out feeling much like a Harry Potter novel then its own thing. \r\nAkudo Sai is a rather interesting character as he wants to be a real holy man with valor so he can be a high Priest but yet ends up in a lot of perverted scenes in seeing women have dressedand up their skirts. He has the feeling of a na\u00efve little boy without being just like Alan from D.Gray Man which would be a little bit over the top. His storyline when he was little is just the same as Harry Potter in that he was left on a doorstep and is considered the hope of someone. \\n\\n\r\nJunko Hattori is a very tomboyish character who at first starts out as a loving friend and then turns her back on him when he is seen as the demon king. Since she follows the Suhara religion, she pretty much is aloud to fight all the time. I don\u2019t really understand why she wears a Fundoshi which looks like a really uncomfortable thing. They show her underwear all the time. \\n\\n\r\nKena Soga seems a bit annoying, and magical girlish. Even though she acts stupid, it seems she is rather smart and her feelings are always true. She may be annoying but I came to like her a little more after each episode. The only thing I don\u2019t like is \\n\\n\r\nKorone has the personality of Yuki from Haruhi Suzumiya and yet she act least jokes. I\u2019m not sure weather or not I actually like her though she does make the show interesting at times. The perverted jokes though do get a bit overboard. For being an android, she seems to love to make fun of all the misunderstandings that happen. \\n\\n\r\nHiroshi Miwa is pretty much the wimpy boy who is always being picked on. He seems exactly like Youhei from Clannad in that he is always following around his \u2018best friend\u2019 for whatever reason. He never seems to think about what he is going to say which makes things even worse for Akudo because most of the misunderstandings are made because of him.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of misunderstandings and the show ends up using them as a comedy skit, many times to the point that sometimes it feels old. Girls always end up in fights where their clothing gets ripped off but it\u2019s not as though it\u2019s as bad as Master of Martial Hearts. In this idea, there is actually a reasoning behind the clothing ripping, not because its tissue paper. The show moves rather fast actually and yet, sometimes it feels a little too fast (I know\u2026 gasp! An anime that goes to fast in its plot!) but still, it makes me feel like I\u2019m missing something.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, it leaves a few questions that I have had, not really explaining much of the full structure. They keep talking about god this and god that but it doesn\u2019t explain much of what that really is. Also, it has some of the feeling from Air: 1000th Summer. Not going to explain how but you will understand when you watch more. They change so many things around and leave it open ended.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is pretty nice and standard, looking a lot like D. Gray Man in how the characters move and the darkness it sometimes has. The ending animation doesn\u2019t hide that this is all a harem in that the main character is seen being paired up with multiple girls at the same time and them all kissing. \\n\\n\r\nI love Akudo\u2019s voice in the English dub, giving him just enough na\u00efve-ness to make him feel innocent but yet at the same time, shows a bit of strength in what he believes in. Chris Patton is pretty good at voicing characters like that well. Greg Ayres is also pretty good at the voice of Hiroshi who is pretty much a minion. This is a guy that does the best as a minion I\u2019m not sold on a couple of the girls voices though since they seem like mostly a hit or miss. Even the music has an air of Harry Potter, making it really hard for me to take seriously. But yet it still has a rather hip and fun feel to it.\\n\\n\r\nThis actually has become one of my favorites.\\n",

            "content": "\"No, Blue is a thousand times better than Red!\"\r\n\"Yellow is a pure maiden.\"\r\n\"Purple has sucked 20 dicks.\"\r\n\"Green is my waifu.\"\r\n\"Peterhausen is obviously the best girl.\"\r\nI'll start by posing a question. What makes an anime good?\r\nAre you perhaps, looking for a great story? One that hooks you from the beginning, and doesn't let your balls go until they're blue and screaming? Maybe characters that grow on you and feel like actual people, or how about stunning visuals that breathe life into the show, and an OST that kicks ass? A masterpiece, if you will?\r\nThen stop reading here, because that's definitely not what the Color Wars is.\r\nHoweverthe Color Wars is one thing. Infinitely entertaining. Explosions, panties, giant tentacle monsters, dragons fighting airships, ninja, pedophiles, and sexual innuendo that pass right over the main characters head, it's all right here. The Color Wars is like watching some of the best and worst things in anime come together and have an explosive tea party. It won't be like anything else you've ever seen, and it won't even make any fucking sense. But I can assure you, it'll be entreating to watch.\\n\\n\r\nWhy is it called the Color Wars? This is simple arithmetic my unobservant friend. Even after spending a substantial amount of time watching the Color Wars, you'll find it challenging to recall the names of the harem members. So how do we refer to these characters? Just call them by their abnormal hair color of course! You've got the rainbow at your disposal, all that's left is to pick your army, and fight with all you\u2019ve got. Throw as much shit as you can at anyone who picks any girl besides your favorite, because they have a disorder my friend. A disorder called Shit Taste.\\n\\n\r\n12 episodes isn't a very long period of time to tell a story. Adaptions seem to suffer from this minuet overlooked detail. The Color Wars doesn't have much of a story; well it does, but it doesn't make much sense. All the details are smashed together, especially in the final episodes, and explanations are locked up like a child who asks too many questions in the basement, never to be seen again.  It doesn\u2019t even matter that the pacing of events is wacked like a drugged hooker. If I have one piece (Shut up, that's not funny) of advice to offer, it's don't take anything anyone in the show says seriously. Decide not to think about anything anymore! \\n\\n\r\nWhile the animation is fairly good, character designs completely lack in any sort of diversity. Green hair goes with green eyes, and blue hair with blue eyes. And just like colors, we've got all sorts of personalities too! Tsunderes, aloof types, lolis, and even a Rei; the fun never really stops. Characters never break out of these cookie cutter archetypes that chain them; not like I ever expected them to anyway. You need to constantly keep in mind that this is a bad harem. I'll reiterate the point, don't think about it.\\n\\n\r\nHowever there is still a group of characters that really get my blood pumping, Primarily Peterhausen (Hah! An alliteration!) and the lead Sai Akuto. Peterhausen is a giant dragon that fights airships and fires drills from his mouth. His character is perfect, never requiring a second of development, by far the best part of the show. Sai Akuto hates the system called god, and would do anything to rebel against an oppressing force. He really keeps the show interesting, playing both the good guy, and the bad guy. While he seems to shy from girls like most harem leads, he also takes shit from no man. You might be surprised at some of his more daring actions.\\n\\n\r\nSo what is a good anime? I think that's mostly up to you to decide, but for me as a general rule, a good anime, is one that achieves what it strives for. The Colors Wars tried to force a horribly written plot down my throat, and I ended up just laughing in its face. By my logic, it isn't qualified to be classified as a good show.\\n\\n\r\nEven though the show misses at its primary target, it still manages to impress me by how over the top and endearing it is. I found myself grinning at the corny lines and colorful fight scenes, even if the context of the situation didn\u2019t quite make sense. In essence, it could be summed up as fun.\\n\\n\r\nBut I need to tell you something Yui. Fun doesn't mean good.\\n",

            "content": "Ichiban Ushiro no Daimaou is a harem series written by Mizuki Shotaro. It was originally a light novel series, which is still going, and got an anime adaptation more recently. I have to say that I have a bad feeling about this one just from the harem and ecchi tags so let's get it over with.\r\nSai Akuto is a transfer student into a prestigious magic academy. He plans to work hard and make the world a better place. When he reports for his physical exam he's told that his future occupation is a demon lord and everyone wants him dead or to get into hispants because free will doesn't exist and he can't just choose a different career or some such nonsense. The plot moves at an absurdly slow pace for most of the series where they introduce minor sub-plots that go absolutely nowhere only to rush through the main story in the last episodes. The plot is cheesy, full of ridiculous cliches and, as if it wasn't bad enough, it gets a deus ex ending. The humour is another factor that utterly fails. How badly? They make a joke about tentacle rape. That's all you really need to know, but if you're curious about the rest of the humour it's mostly tasteless sex jokes.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are flat, one-dimensional cliches. They're about as developed as the cast of Kingdom Hearts. That's how exceedingly bland they are. You can pretty easily predict what each character is going to do shortly after being introduced to them just by being passingly familiar with the tropes they embody. Making their interactions completely uninteresting. \\n\\n\r\nThe art could be well done, if not for one major issue. The fan-service. I know, I complain about fan-service frequently in my reviews, but this has such an excessive level of fan-service that it makes everything else I've reviewed look tame by comparison. It's so bad that it borders on soft-core porn. The fight scenes are dull. They're over far too quickly and, frequently, they're used as a thin excuse to strip the female characters. This anime wouldn't be able to understand how to keep things classy with four years of study under Gail Simone. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting and music are both pretty forgettable. They aren't bad but they aren't anything special either. They just get the job done. \\n\\n\r\nThe yuri factor is a 2/10. There's one scene involving Fujiko, unfortunately it's a rape joke. Most of the time the female characters can't even pass the Bechdel test, much less develop relationships with each other. \\n\\n\r\nMy final rating for Ichiban Ishiro no Daimaou is a 1/10. The series substitutes any kind of depth for ludicrous amounts of fan-service. Add the fact that the humour is repulsive and the characters flat and all you have left is the fan-service and, frankly, if that's what you're looking for you'd be better off just watching hentai.",

            "content": "I really wanted to like this show.  The premise is great, the world has a lot of potential, and there are many things this show does really well.  Despite its gratuitious action scenes which are violent without being overly gory, the show never quite takes itself too seriously, and there are plenty of things to laugh about.  It also has a typical ecchi harem subplot to add a healthy dose of titillation.\r\nDespite all its good points however, it suffers from a single, major flaw, from which all its weaknesses stem: this story is far too ambitious for 12 episodes.\r\nAll the problems ofthis show could have been solved if it extended the same story to two seasons.  There would have been more time to develop the characters and learn the motivations behind the various factions.  It would also give more room for a few filler episodes so that it would feel like there's a middle to this story and not just a beginning and end.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, it's way too confusing.  Again, this has to do with the fact that there's not enough time in 12 episodes to develop the plot.  Also, there are too many factions with various goals.  It's not a simple good-guys-vs-bad-guys show (which, admittedly, is to be expected from a show where the hero is a demon lord).  Instead, you have various groups vying for power.  When they all come to a head in the final episodes, it's hard to know who to root for because you don't know their motivations.  Heck, they even introduce some new factions right in the final battle who show up just to add confusion to an already confusing plot.\\n\\n\r\nIt all gets sorted out in the end, though.  I must admit, I really like the resolution to the show.  The hero fulfills his role as Demon Lord better than anyone could have hoped and worse than anyone could have feared, while somehow still managing to remain a good guy.  The final resolution is good enough to counter a lot of the problems of the show.  Not quite enough to break even though, so I give the whole thing a 3.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\\n\r\nNothing spectacular, but I can't really complain about anything.  The character designs are fine.  It has a great looking dragon.\\n\\n\r\nNotes on fanservice: There's a little nudity, but too often they employ convenient censorship.  I mean, how can you have a girl (Keena) whose magic depends upon her being nude, yet somehow limit her frontal nudity to one brief scene?\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\\n\r\nI score it this high because of the theme song.  This is the one thing the show does perfectly.  Normally it takes me three or four times listening to the theme song of an anime show before I really like it, but this one hooked me right from the very first time.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, let me take just a moment to comment on the opening credits.  Totally badass!  Easily my favorite opening of any anime.  The theme song is great, right from the beginning with the electric guitar introduction and especially where the mana gauge cranks up to max just as the bass starts playing.  I like the nightmarish imagery of Akuto running through the city and encountering all the different characters in the show.  I get chills when the dragon bursts out of the ground and at the brief closeup of Akuto's red eyes.  This is the perfect opening credits for an action anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5\\n\\n\r\nThere's no time to really develop the characters enough to make them particularly interesting.  The result is some canned characters that don't have enough time to establish themselves before they're forced to make life-changing decisions in the final episodes.  The result is that we don't really understand them, therefore we can't empathise with them, therefore their motivations are confusing.  That's not to say the characters aren't likable; they are.  They're just not developed.\\n\\n\r\nOne other note:  Personally, if I were the hero, I would just run away with Keena (after investing in the world's biggest rice cooker).  Forget destiny.  I know she's a bit of an airhead, but she's the only one who accepts him just for who he is, and doesn't care that he's a demon lord.  Can you tell who my favorite character is?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\\n\r\nThe show has some strengths and weaknesses.  There are some great moments, like the battle between the dragon and the flying battleship, the most absurdly comical resolution to a battle I've ever seen in Episode 3, and \"I'm going to betray you all\" in Episode 11.  If only these scenes were fit into a cohesive plot... sigh.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, the confusing subplots ruined this for me.  There were some great parts, but not enough to overcome its weaknesses.\\n",

On the way, he befriends the beautiful Junko Hattori, and they share a vow of loyalty and friendship; her family hasserved the empire for generations, and his devotion to the goal of becoming a High Priest means they share a desire to serve mankind for the better. \\n\\n\r\nAt the start of his first day, Sai is informed by the Aptitude-Reading Spirit that his future occupation is Demon King, a title reserved for soulless monsters and genocidal warlords. Upon reaching his first class he is challenged to a duel and, in defending himself, accidentally demolishes the classroom and spurs on the rumors of his future-coming infamy. The male students cower in his presence while the girls whisper that his merest touch will impregnate them, and his homeroom teacher implores him that, before he does the inevitable and commits suicide, he calls her so that she can preserve him as one of the undead. After all, the opportunity to study a Demon King is the chance of a lifetime, and he IS right nearby and doomed to hate his life.\\n\\n\r\nHARSH.\\n\\n\r\nThis show keeps the hits coming with comical circumstances, wonderful characters, and epic battles. The story has only just begun, but it smacks with all of the wondrous components that make our favorites, our favorites. I encourage anyone who loves harem comedies, awkward situational comedies, epic magic battles, and/or ecchi girls to tune in and turn on.",

Making it funny at a lot of parts, also with the ecchi in it makes it even more unserious. \r\nAlso i this anime has some\u00b4nasty\u00b4things in this anime wich are pretty much hillarious with the reactions of the characters. If you dislike these \u00b4wrong\u00b4 anime\u00b4s, please do not watch it. It\u00b4s supposed to be an funny anime with some serious moments in it.\r\nOverall on of these anime who wont be rated highly bad at an avarage of a 6/7, i think it\u00b4s a 7 whichis an honnest personal rating. I want to go over the parts which determine my conclusion about this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is well yeay not unique but epic. the reactions and behaviour of this anime is pretty much in sync with the storyline which i like and also i think that this anime made the excecution decent enough but not as good as the more highly rated anime\u00b4s.\\n\\n\r\nArt, uhh cute girls with a clumsy unknowing boy, that\u00b4s well yeay kinda the same as all echhi and romantic anime\u00b4s wich well yeay i like the idea and all but well yeay it\u00b4s getting old. the art in general is well produced but the small details could\u00b4ve gotten a bit more work.\\n\\n\r\nSound, bad excecuted standart sounds and kinda  a lack of background sounds. but well yeay. that\u00b4s with all of these anime with a couple of exceptions ofcours. not something to look out for.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\u00b4s haha nice this is what i like about this, on of these anime who did something about this. all characters have a different role and a meaning in the future of the episodes. well produced and some unique extra material wich is awesome.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment is kinda a personal question so watch it and give your own. i think it was extremely enjoyable but more to say isn\u00b4t there.\\n\\n\r\nSo?\\n\r\nA decent and unserious anime with a lot of funny moments and echhi. \\n\r\nwould rate 7. not to special but if you feel like having a fun time, watch it. if you want to watch anime that are serious and want you to learn something. please dont watch.\\n\\n\r\nEchhi, romance, action, harem style anime lovers, watch this anime please\\n\r\nPeople who want to laugh and dont mind echhi and such, watch this anime.\\n\r\nPeople who want an anime wich is serious and realistic, please dont.\\n\\n\r\nSorry about my English, it's not perfect.

            "content": "This spring's animes really gives a lot to think about.. I wonder if the parade of gags, parody and eros are medicine for those starting a new life, or just a sign that the industry is falling into an endless limbo. \r\nStory: 6 \r\nLike many of the animes this season, the synopsis is catchy enough to attract many fans. It's hard to resist the temptation of an anti-hero who is labeled a demon king from the very start. Compared to the other animes this season, it isn't too bad either. The story is, although very questionable at times, very fast-paced and keeps your eyes onthe screen and your mind on the next best thing this anime is going to slam in your face. In essence, the story has no seriousness and could have been better with a little more philosophical sense, but of course you can't expect an anime trying to appeal eroticism and comedy to have such depth. However, there is a lot of potential in the story nonetheless. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nCompared to a lot of the visual headaches I have seen this season, at least this one stands out among the rest. It's not enough to go up against kyoani and key, but it's a real saviour. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nUnless you really want some good songs and bgms, it won't bother you much. As expected of a gag-filled harem anime, anyways.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nThe main character is the type i have absolutely no complains about. He's the perfect anti-hero who is able to stay calm while the whole world around him goes crazy. In contrast, the harem girls have so little character they're just good for the visual experience and unstoppable gags.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nI've very much tired myself of harems which portray nothing but idiotic and shallow eroticism, but I must say this anime has introduced a different enjoyment to me. I still think that it would be a lot better if they scraped most of the eros and put more thought to the plot, though. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\r\nCompared to the other spring animes, this one is probably a gem amongst them, but still not good enough to be a noticeable winner.",

            "content": "Well, I have to say this one was pretty hard to rate.  I really want to give this anime an 8 or maybe even a 9, but I'll have to settle on something lower because there are some flaws that are just too big to ignore.\r\nLet's start with the story.  This is why it's so hard to rate.  It actually has a good story.  But the pacing is pretty hard to cope with.  The first 7 or 8 episodes are mostly character development with little bearing over the overall plot.  This guy comes to a magic school wanting tobecome a high priest and help mankind as much as possible.  So then there's his physical when he enters his new school that also acts to predict the future occupation of students.  And our here gets to be.....that's right a Demon Lord.  King of all the demons in the world and somewhat opposing to his \"I'll do my best to help everyone\" mentality.  That's all well and good until the main plot begins to move somewhere around episode 7.  Then you get this massive, somewhat complicated plot that other anime 24+ episodes long would have trouble fitting in.  And this one is only 12.\\n\\n\r\nIt seems like this one tries to be the anti-Bleach/One Piece/Naruto and just does its best to not be longer than 12 episodes.  No.  Matter.  What.  And so the last 4 episodes generally leaves you a little unsatisfied because it moves so fast and leaves out any explanations of the situation that would serve to either make the anime longer or make the plotline comprehensible.  I just finished watching this series today, and I've spent quite a lot of time just trying to figure out how I should rate it all.  The story is actually quite decent if you can grasp most of what's going on in the last few episodes, but it feels so rushed I've thought about rating it anywhere from a 4 to a 9 because of it.  So, for putting 97% of a massive, complex, and pretty decent story into a blender and serving it all in just a few episodes, I'm giving the story a 6.  I'm going to touch on more of the story later in the enjoyment section, like the harem and ecchi points, so stay tuned.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on, I think I'll combine the art and sound.  Both are good but not spectacular, fairly generic at times, and that's about it.  They don't take anything away from the show and don't make the show stand out either.  So the art and sound departments get a solid 7 from me.\\n\\n\r\nNext I'll go into the characters.  The main character is Sai Akuto.  Like I said before he wants to help people as much as possible and has high aims to reach that goal.  The first episode makes sure to show him as being one to help as much as he can, even if the situation he has fallen into seems to have made it impossible to really help people.  He's not your standard magical harem kind of main character though.  He's one of the more likable, yet misunderstood characters I've seen in a main character role.  So, enter harem of girls.  Hattori, Korone, Etou sempai, and Soga are the girls.  They all have unique points, but are overall mostly generic.  If you watch, you'll see what I mean.  And Hiroshi is the obligatory male friend who worships the future Devil Lord.  He's quite funny early on but later, his character changes completely and I don't know if I like it or not.  I give the characters an 7 because I really liked the characters early on, but in the onrush of the plot, some of the characters' personalities changed quite a bit with no explanation or really any warning of a change.  \\n\\n\r\nNow for the enjoyment part.  I really enjoyed the show early on.  In the first 5 or so episodes the humor was incredibly lewd and just plain fun.  There was a whole lot of ecchiness in the show.  Really the front half of the show was bursting at the seams with ecchiness.  But it was hilarious and super enjoyable as well.  Around the midpoint of the show though, all that is turned down to a just somewhat ecchi show, and in the last few episodes is the action of the plot with no room for humor or hardly any ecchiness at all.  That coupled with the unreal expectation of fitting that plot into 4 episodes dropped my enjoyment from a 10, but I still give it a 9.\\n\\n\r\nI would reccomend this show to most people, but I would also warn everyone to pay attention carefully in the last 5 episodes cause if you miss anything, you really might not understand the plot at all.  So, because of the extreme rushed feel to the last half of the anime, I have to give the show as 7, no higher.",

I think it could have had a lot more success as a 24-26 episode series because the story seems too complicated to be explained in half that. Anyone who loves Zero No Tsukaima or similar anime should enjoy a bit more ecchi version of it or similar anime. Its character development was alright but i feel like the end of one episode didn't directly lead into the next and sometimes leaves you wondering what thehell happened in between.",

            "content": "Okay, Ichiban Ushiro no Daimaou, or \"Demon Lord furthest in the back\" or whatever it is that you want to call this series, starts off with a basic setup, boy meets girl, boy helps girl (actually helped her grandmother who was helping her, kids these days, huh?), boy shares aspirations to become big-shot good guy, boy and girl swear allegiance. It also seems to involve magic. This would be a good start to an anime where the Main Character becomes a hero. It isn't.\r\nAs soon as MC gets to school he is put through a rigorous health and well-being test, also known as a smoking,bespectacled bird in a jar. Who also tells the future, specifically the future job of the person under inspection. This all takes three seconds. And shocking twist, MC turns out to be destined to become a Demon Lord. Such a good setup, this anime should be interesting!\\n\r\nIt's from about this point that things all go awry.\\n\r\nWhy does it go awry? Well, let's start with my ratings.\\n\r\nStory: 3\\n\r\n\"Why did you give it a three, you just told us that the story was set up so well, how can anyone mess it up?\" I hear you asking. It's rather simple really, the extent of the plot and the story.\\n\r\nNow, don't get me wrong, the story isn't actually that bad, for a 50 episode series, 26 at a push, the problem with it is that the story is jammed into 12 episodes. You can literally see the anime bursting at the seams by how much story it's trying to hold in. I quite frequently got confused by a turn of events simply because of the lack of development and potential forshadowing, and the final four episodes or so felt like a two hour slog *per episode* that much story is crammed in. It goes from a fairly light, gag-based setting, where panty shots are routine, to suddenly the world has been flipped upside-down, shit got serious somewhere off-screen, and panty shots are routine. The lack of development in the major areas of the story had me almost reaching for the stop button in the final few episodes.\\n\r\nThe magic system in this anime felt tacked on as an afterthought almost, as a body to convey the fact that weird shit is happening, and indulge in too much nudity.\\n\r\nCharacters: 3\\n\r\nAs a consequence of the above crammed story, the characters come off as one-dimensional, and unrelatable. The main Love Interest (and good luck trying to pick EXACTLY which one of five girls this is supposed to be, the OP and ED don't help this cause) regularly flip-flops between support and understanding, and hatred and anger, all with love underlying it, something that is never developed.\\n\r\nMC is no exception to the one-dimensional characterisation that was caused by the jam-packed storyline. In the first episode, prior to learning his future occupation, he claims that he want's to become High Priest of all things Holy, Just and Pure (so much so that apparently littering would cause him to loose all chances). This is so that he can fulfil his wish of helping all those worse off, later the wish becomes to change \"God\", and finally to destroy \"God\", all with little indication of what happened in between.\\n\r\nOf the rest of the main cast, which is very thin on the ground, there is Evil Witch (who tries to promote the Demon Lord), Creepy Stalker (An android sent to keep an eye on the Demon Lord), Love Interest #2 (Ditzy), #1 Follower (Complete with catch-phraise \"Aniki!\") and Evil Bitch (nemesis of Love Interest #1). Add a giant dragon that knows more than it lets on and there is your cast, and motivations. Things get a little complicated when #1 Follower gets Powers Of His Own, but that doesn't result in much.\\n\r\nSecondary Cast includes another potential love interest (also Student Council President), the school nurse (and MC's homeroom teacher), and a bunch of people who really only serve to deliver a handful of lines.\\n\r\nI gave Art and Sound 7 simply because there wasn't much I could fault it on, it worked, the art got across more than the story could manage (not saying much) and the sound was everything you could want from a soundtrack, it didn't get in the way. Otherwise, nothing outstanding.\\n\r\nMy enjoyment of this series was limited. I've harked on enough about the presentation of the story, so I won't bore you any more with that. As a result, enjoyment got a 3.\\n\r\nOverall I gave this a 5, due to the bonus marks from art and sound and for having a good basic idea, but I had to fight for that high a mark, simply because of how much I was disappointed with it. The mood flip-flopped (as often as Love Interest #1's mood) between light-hearted, gags and nudity to Serious Shit. I would watch an anime that expanded on the story so things made more sense and they fixed the pacing issues, but wouldn't recommend watching this series.",

            "content": "\"That's why I decided not to think about anything anymore!\"\r\nThat's a good one-line summary of this anime taken straight from the last episode. It's safe to say that the enjoyment of this anime is inversely proportional to the amount of plot stuffed into one episode. Simply, the more plot, the less fun. Ichiban is a harem anime. That means it doesn't exist to cater to the brain, and it doesn't. You should be aware that if you're going to watch this anime, then you're watching it for a good laugh, a small smirk, and moments where you can go \"Oh Japan!\" and laugh at whatmakes it onto millions of TV sets across seas. You will like the fight scenes, and you will never learn the characters names - you will refer to them by hair color.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5/10\\n\r\nThe demon lord, 100 years ago, tried to destroy humanity. The demon lord was killed and peace resumed, and up until our story begins, nothing as terrible has happened since then. Here our protagonist is introduced, Sai Akuto. His goal is be someone of great authority who will lead people to lead righteous lives (the anime alludes to the Pope). He then meets Hattori Junko, or \"the Blue one\", and she and Sai hit it off and look like they're going to be great friends. Then a tweest. Sai Akuto is designated by the sorting hat, I mean, the Yata-Garasu, as the future demon lord! Oh no! Blue gets mad, challenges Sai to a duel, then tsundere love kicks into effect and then a robot (Green) comes out of nowhere and an invisible girl gets fingered (Red) all in one episode! Actually, the exposition was pretty awesome and I really enjoyed it... But... It is safe to say, that the plot of the anime was almost nil after the first episode. Eventually we have incestuous sibling love, the power rangers, ninja idols, time travel, pseudo-space and all other kinds of crazy stuff coming into the anime. I understand it's anime about magic where 'anything could happen because we are led into a mysterious world whose limits are not ever revealed' but I would like at least some boundaries. When the mysterious man who is awkwardly introduced tried to rape numerous protagonists with giant sea cucumbers, I could safely say that I no longer took the plot seriously. But that's okay. It's a harem.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThink Gurren Lagann fight scenes. Then turn it down a little bit and make sure that there is a lot more OVER 9000 and laser beams and is sped up about fourteen times. You now have a good idea about what fight scenes in Ichiban are like. Animation is superb, art is a little different. The art for me was a little too generic. It felt kind of like fluidity and motion were really nice but left more to desire when someone wasn't kicking ass. If you were to compare this to numerous other harem anime, it just doesn't seem to be much different visually. But that's okay. It has cool fight scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nAki Toysaki does a really awesome job as Soga Keena (Red), but if you don't like her then I recommend turning the volume off, she gets a LOT of screen time, and talks a crap load. Aoi Yuuki (who voiced Mina Tepes from Vampire Bund and Noel from Sora no Woto) had a great voice too. She voiced a monotone character, but did a really job making it sound \"not as monotone.\"  I really had no affection toward the OP or the ED. But that's okay. They suited a harem anime very well, and maybe you'll like them because music is a developed taste.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\r\nI don't know whether to give this a 1 for about a million bland characters, or a 10 for Peterhausen the dragon who shoots fiery drills. The main cast is a pallet of fun (rimshot). Everyone is a different hair color and a different \"dere\" so they're easy to tell apart! That's where the harem anime has the most trouble in my opinion. A harem has set archetypal characters and refuses to create an original endearing woman. I'm not saying that any woman in this anime is poorly written. Each one is written with her character in mind, but never strays from what the textbook says. Red is an airhead, Etou (Purple) is masochist, Blue is tsundere, and Green is emotionless. All of them can be summed up in one word. \\n\\n\r\nSai Akuto is on the other hand, a very interesting character. The setting continually sets him up to be a bad guy, but somehow he always manages to do the right thing, whether people know he's doing it or not. The typical male protagonist in a harem always tries to avoid temptation, but without a clear motive as to why. For example, for some craaaazy reason one of the beautiful ladies has appeared in front of our protagonist naked.Our protagonist, who very often envisions this event happening, suddenly has an over-powering urge to avoid any sexually conduct with this woman. BUT WHY? She's beautiful, naked, and right freaking in front of you! This creates character inconsistencies, but where our protagonist differs, is that when he refuses the woman (which alas he does), he is still in character. In summary, Sai Akuto is a good guy, and no one can tell him otherwise. I like that. As for the rest of the other characters, they're nothing special. But that's okay. Sai is a really cool character you'll love to see on screen, and to boot he isn't a sissy wimp like a lot of other harem protagonists!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nEven with so many things working against this anime, there are so many moments where you'll seriously just laugh. I enjoyed a great portion of this anime. The only problem I really had was with the plot. But that's definitely okay! I remembered that it was a harem anime and anyone who forgets this key factor should try to understand that a little bit of mindless humor is good once in a while.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\r\nIchiban is not a memorable anime. It really has nothing worth remembering (except Peterhausen). It just follows a long line of other harem anime into oblivion. But hey, it's only 12 episodes, and it's a fun little anime. I'd say it's worth recommending, but not worth ask feedback on. The response you'll get will be \"Well... It was a harem anime... I liked 'X female'\" so on and etc.\\n\\n\r\nBut that's okay. Because it IS a harem anime and expecting anything more than that is just plain craziness.",

            "content": "Is it just me, or is the playback rate at 200%?\r\n'Ichiban Ushiro no Daimaou (The Great Demon King in the Very Back)' is set in an elite magic school where aspiring magicians learn to control their mana. The initial setting is very similar to 'To Aru Majutsu no Index'. One day, a transfer student (Akuto Sai) arrives. New students are required to go through an analysis by the \"artificial spirit\", which predicts future occupation with 100% accuracy. Surprisingly, the artificial spirit predicts Akuto will become the next Demon King. Once dreamed of becoming the High Priest, Akuto must spend his school life with the burdenof becoming the ultimate evil while his true powers awaken, going through one misunderstanding after another.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nI actually found the original setting to be very intriguing. My impression after the first two episodes were... it's good enough that it didn't even have to be ecchi. The setting itself had the fantasy, opportunity for interesting story development, and possible obstacles all built in. It even had a super cool background where Akuto's self-introduction sounded like the real demon king that appeared 100 year ago.\\n\\n\r\nI haven't read the light novel or the manga series, but from the anime, it seems like the title \"The Great Demon King in the Very Back\" comes from the fact that Akuto was given the seat in the very last row of his classroom. Sadly, the title of this anime series foreshadowed the pattern of story development... You would think Akuto will slowly become a dark presence in the back of his classroom while he tries to clear all the misunderstandings right? Think again. If I'm not mistaken, he hasn't sat in his seat since episode two. And so, the story jumped from one direction to another, random new organizations and villains appeared out of nowhere, and it eventually became mindless fights before the series ended, leaving me completely clueless. It actually got so bad at one point that Akuto threw a monster egg out of a window during breakfast, and the next cut was the crew outside at night in front of the monster egg, which grew exponentially. Really, it's one of those \u7a81\u3063\u8fbc\u307f\u6240\u304c\u591a\u3059\u304e\u3066 \"I don't know where I should begin pointing out the flaws\".\\n\\n\r\nJust like that monster egg, the story seemed to have an exponential acceleration in terms of pacing. The first two episodes had good pacing as introduction of the surroundings. Up until episode 7 was fast paced, but acceptable for slapstick comedy, but the final 5 episodes were packed with random events and explanations that seemed to go on and on without giving the audience time to absorb the story. The characters in the latter half actually started verbally describing the situation, and it wasn't even a deliberate slapstick joke.\\n\\n\r\nI have to say the ecchi element was applied very effectively in this series though. Sometimes ecchi scenes were forced, like repetitive explosions stripping Junko or Keina getting naked every time she becomes transparent, but somehow they were funny every single time. Other ones happen more spontaneously, from skirts too short and creative camera angles that seem to focus on their panties. If there was a cameraman for this show, he was a major perv. This show is probably the closest to hentai category as an under-18 show can possibly get. It goes as far as giving a sea cucumber hand job until it squirts sticky white goo on another girl's face in a certain episode, and \"classic tentacle hold\" (you know the one I'm talking about if you've even seen an action hentai series) where one tentacle almost goes all the way in.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, the story was a mess, and there were way too many loose ends and question marks unanswered.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nExtremely inconsistent.\\n\r\nThe character designs are very good. Akuto has the obvious \"mark of the Demon King\" below his eye, but it keeps his appearance somewhat original, and he has that cool look and badass confidence that will eventually attract all the girls and create his harem. The girls are all hot, and there were abundance of fan service. Action scenes are pretty cool, and early episodes had really nice CG effects with magic circles and spectacular spells.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, they try to be \"So bad it's actually good\" with Brave and villains similar to something out of \"Needless\" or even \"Scryed\" about half way, and fails miserably. Monsters attracted by Akuto's powers looked like they're from late '90s demon hentai anime.\\n\r\nPerhaps it was caused by deadlines or budget, the animation quality noticeably degrades as the show go on.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nVoice acting is decent. All the characters sound like they should, and none particularly annoying. Considering the (presumably) low budget they had, they gathered a decent cast as voice actors.\\n\r\nMusic score is disastrous. Although none of the pieces were out of place, the back ground music completely lack originality, and made absolutely no impact to the viewing experience.\\n\r\nOP/ED were average. They fit the series pretty well, but not especially catchy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nAll the main characters were extremely likable, and had unique backgrounds. However, very few of them actually developed as the show had hazardous pacing problems. Junko remained an archetype tsundere to the end, and Fujiko was a SM queen who we don't know if she was a \"S\" personality who wanted to control Akuto or a \"M\" personality who wanted to serve under him. I feel Akuto and his henchman Hiroshi were somewhat well-developed, but the pacing made it impossible to pursue such deep issues such as responsibility, justice, morality, and all those things they wanted to explore.\\n\\n\r\nI really liked Korone's character. An android with sense of humor done right is rare, and the character developed as much as an android could in a 12-episode-long series. She was also a very effective comedic device, and I liked how she gave Akuto the hardest time with her sexual approaches.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall:\\n\r\n'Ichiban Ushiro no Daimaou' had a great potential to become something special. The show started out pretty strong, and had the slapstick comedy seemed to be working at first, but it was a downward spiral from there. As mentioned many times before, the pacing is far too fast, even for a slapstick comedy series. They tried to pack 20 episodes worth of material into a 12-episode, 1-season long series. Everything seemed to be twice as fast as they should be. I tend to read subtitle as future reference for fansubbing, but I gave up halfway because the characters were babbling nonsense at an absurd rate. Also, if you blank out for 3 seconds, chances are you missed an important explanation of the plot, a cool action scene, or even worse, a panchira.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps it would've been better if they added some more material and extended to a 2-season long series, but then again, it would've been even longer painful viewing experience unless they made major modifications to the story. Despite the worthless production value of this show, it's an enjoyable series if you shut down half of your brain because the characters had the charm and it offers good laughs from many ecchi jokes and misunderstandings Akuto had gone through in the first half of the series.\\n\\n\r\nI feel the major problem was that 'Ichiban Ushiro no Daimaou' tried to be too many things. There was ecchi, comedy, drama, and tried to tackle the issue of right and wrong. The producers should've simply made it an 12-episode long ecchi-driven slapstick comedy, or 25-episode long action drama with a philosophical touch. Not both.",

            "content": "I started watching this the first week it was aired, so I was following most of this as it was being subbed, apart from the last 4 episodes which I burst through this evening by force.\r\nThis anime starts off very strong in my opinion, it is funny, it is reasonably paced, the characters are interesting, and although there are hints of being slightly generic on occassion in the first few episodes, I dismissed them as everything else was great.\r\nThe intro hooks you as it starts out at a train station, the main protagonist Sai Akuto is getting on the train to his new school withhopes of becoming a priest, how wrong his hopes will turn out to be though.\\n\\n\r\nImmediately he meets with one of the female heroines, and gets off to a rocky start, which is quickly remedied, and they quickly become friends, and from that introduction easing you in, it starts throwing scraps of the main plot at you, mixed in with interesting characters and lots of funny moments to keep you interested, it seemed so perfect at first, to me at least, as everything was right, everything fit, it seemed great and I couldn't say a bad word about it.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character was likeable, he wasn't a stale, brown haired with glasses \"I want to always do the right thing nothing else matters I won't hurt people but I don't want to die\" clich\u00e9 piece of rubbish we've seen a million times. He was a unique character, interesting, likeable. He wasn't afraid to stand up, to get in a fight where necessary, but he tried to avoid it otherwise in a reasonable fashion, a simple first hurdle that so many protagonists in this kind of genre fail at and which anger me every time.\\n\\n\r\nThe female heroines had some generic stereotypes thrown in here and there, but overall were a solid set of characters, all unique and different, with different motives for being with the protagonist, different goals in mind, all drawn to him and all playing an important part to the main plot evenly, no girl is completely left out.\\n\r\nOn a personal side note I absolutely adored the robot girl and student council president. Especially the president, my lord she was brilliant.\\n\r\nThe other 'throwaway' side characters as I like to call them aren't annoying, they're reasonably likeable, they do their job well and don't feel forced.\\n\r\nOverall the cast was very solid and worked together well.\\n\\n\r\nThe main problem with this series though, is that it starts to rush things.\\n\r\nREALLY rush things, and it loses a lot of it's charm, especially around the middle sections to near the end.\\n\\n\r\nBefore you know it, everything has been introduced for a base to build the main plot on, then suddenly the main plot kicks into overdrive and you're left sitting with your head cocked to one side, confused as to where this all of a sudden came from, who these new people are, what is actually going on. Especially in the build up to the last few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nIt was obvious that they had to cram a lot together in the 12 episodes, and it would have been much better as a 24 episode series in my honest opinion, as a lot of it was explained in a rather backhanded manner, \"Oh, by the way, x is now x of so and so and does this, this is what is the cause of that, understand what's going on now? no? me either.\", at least that is how it felt to me at times.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing to note though, when the main serious plot does kick in, while the jokes don't completely dissipate; they are toned down. A lot.\\n\r\nThere are probably more jokes and hilarious moments in a single early episode than there is in the last 5.\\n\\n\r\nAnother gripe is how it seems to almost change genre episode 5+, at times it suddenly gets rather cheesy, with fighting and action scenes that I can only describe as \"a mix between dragonball z and naruto\" in some cases, especially the sword in the stone bit, I won't spoil, but that seemed too ludicrous for me to handle.\\n\\n\r\nIt almost feels as if it can't decide what it would prefer to do, stick with the way it started in the first few episodes, or switch to a generic fighting anime style, it hovers in-between and it aggravated me somewhat.\\n\\n\r\nDespite it's flaws, and in my opinion becoming very generic and average in the middle areas, the late areas redeemed themselves, with the final two episodes being genuinely enjoyable again, although the ending felt like a slight cop-out to me, it was still enjoyable, so if you do watch, be warned that you might have to force yourself to watch some episodes near the middle.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, enough with explaining the story, characters and my enjoyment of it, onto the art and sound.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was very good, the animation was done to a reasonably good standard, neither were anything to go crazy about, but they were good.\\n\r\nMost of the characters had unique visual properties  (I say most) that define them and make them unique, so for the most part there are no copypasted characters, the main protagonist is definitely unique, and in a very good way.\\n\r\nI never found any glaring faults with things like anatomy or the way characters move, which is always a good thing, oh, and I watched it uncensored so I cannot comment on how the censorship was done, sorry there.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIn regards to sound, the OP was very nice, I liked it a lot in terms of both the animation and the music, the ED was alright too, but I wasn't a huge fan.\\n\r\nThe music in the actual anime wasn't really that memorable except in one or two sections, so it is a solid 5-6 on that front, but I liked the voice acting a lot, so that bumps it up to an 8.\\n\r\nThe voice actors were very good in my opinion, they conveyed the emotions, reactions and feelings well, I can't say anything bad about them.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, it gets a 7 in my opinion, it was honestly enjoyable, but it rushed too much and felt like it couldn't decide what it wanted to be as an anime.\\n\r\nIt could have been so much more.\\n\\n\r\nStill, I would recommend fans of the comedy/supernatural genre give it a try as it is a good all rounder still, I just don't see it getting any special mention or being considered \"amazing\" any time soon.",

            "content": "I have noticed, in recent years, the shift away from the straight ecchi harem, and I can't complain. The action-romance-harem is much more enjoyable, and is a far better investment when it comes to time spent watching anime. So, when I saw this series, I had hope. And, throughout the first six or seven episodes, I thought that my hope had been realized. But, by episode ten, I have realized that I was premature in that judgment. This anime does a lot right, and is probably worth of a watch, but it is no masterpiece, and suffers from some major flaws, particularly in regards toit's over structure and the way it's story plays out.\\n\\n\r\nWARNING: There are some spoilers in this review. They aren't super huge, and you kinda see them coming in the series anyway, but whatever. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 6 fair* \\n\r\n*Really it should be \"story for eps 1-6 is an 8 or 9; story for episode 7 on is a 4\"\\n\\n\r\nThis is a \"magic functions along with science in and alternate modern day or near future\" kind of universe, much like Zero no tsukaima or Maburaho. As I watched, I realized it was amongst the best of these type of anime. The characters work nice together and are consistent in their behavior, so that once you accept the premise you don't find yourself having to suspend your disbelief too much. Now, that's not to say there isn't some silliness, but it works. Also, the idea for the story is a very interesting one. THE MAJOR PROBLEM IS, it moves too fast. This is not a 12 episode series. This is a twenty four episode series crammed into twelve. As a result, they sacrifice character building (though they manage an admirable job within their limits) and world building (which is the one that really suffers) to fit everything in. Unfortunately, this means that there are characters, like the headmaster, or the teacher, who you don't really care much about and who don't seem to fit in the story. The central characters could really use more time together, letting us get to know them and invest in their well being.\\n\\n\r\nInstead the story pacing is like that girl who you like, and have a good first and second date with, but now she is having some major financial problem and demands your aid even though you've only really known her a week and a half. You're torn, because you know it could have developed into something good if you'd have just had more time, but now she's asking too much too soon, and you really just wanna back off a bit.\\n\\n\r\nSPOILER FOLLOWING\\n\r\nAlso, I have major problems with the content of the story. Like the fact that it's an entirely unsubtle atheist rant, with some humanist overtones. The whole, \"I'm going to destroy God\" and the \"God is just a system that human came up with to justify war and inequality they want to enforce, so it's bad and evil\" and all that is just so unnecessary. In the story world, \"God\" is a giant evil computer that's not really well explained at all, and is somehow blamed for some of the bad stuff that is happening to the main characters. The story would be so much better if they had left that out, or at least not attached religious names and iconography to the computer system and the magic officials. The atheist message would have been an implicit, potential reading, but it would completely and suddenly alienate people of faith, like myself. \\n\r\nAlso, it is so thematically weak because of what it does. In the story universe, there is no God literally is a created machine that people have illogically deified. In the real world, the existence of God is, at the very least, debatable. I don't want to make religious arguments here, but what I'm saying is, I want the God computer destroyed because it seems evil, but I've not been influenced in my opinions relating to God in the real world at all, because they are two totally different things that have only been connected by the author's choice to use the same name. \\n\\n\r\nIt's just dumb. I hate it when heavy handed, talentless hacks with an axe to grind ruin what was shaping up to be an interesting story with unnecessary, foundationally weak preaching, because they don't know how to show the audience something, only how to tell them.\\n\r\nEND SPOILER\\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, there are some mild inconsistencies int he main character's actions, the background behind the major conflict, that is the \"why are they even doing this\" is never really discussed, the major villain appears with minimal warning and development, and the pacing goes from  0 to 60 and then back, so you're never sure whether it's a side story or the main story until you're already in it.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the main character's powers develop a bit too fast. That's one of the reasons they should have spent longer on the series. He seems to spontaneously become the master of all magic, even though he is only barely learning and has minimal control at the beginning. They could have made him a super powerful badass, they should have just don so more gradually. Showing him fight some of the student as the disciplinary guy, or a learning montage of him in school getting better, would have easily satisfied this and made the passage of time feel a bit less rapid. Also, some time references, like \"it's already been x months since you came!\" and such.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9 great\\n\r\nReally well animated. The character designs are nothing ground breaking and new, but originality does not mean quality. These characters fit their voices and personalities, the combat (especially) is well done, and pretty well choreographed, there aren't that many continuity problems with the animation from cut to cut, and the even the fan-service is drawn particularly well. Usually I don't much care for fan service at all, especially when it distracts from the story, and there are some instances it does in this anime, but they are far fewer than is the standard for harem series, and it is well done when it occurs, so I don't over penalize it. So, yeah, for nothing something that's already been done really well, you still get a gold star.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7 good\\n\r\nThe opening is fitting and catchy, a good choice. The foley and background music is unobtrusive, doesn't really stand out. Once again, it's nothing amazing, like the full orchestral scores they do for one piece, or the edgy synthesized instrumental/industrial style stuff they use in Bleach, but it's well done enough that it contributes a bit to the story atmosphere rather than detracting. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8 very good\\n\r\nThe main character, unlike in Zero no Tsukaima, is not such a ridiculous pervert that you hate him for it; nor is he weak, limited and indecisive, like in Maburaho. He's actually one of the few harem main characters that I really like. He's generally consistent and a good guy, if a bit on the ruthless side at times (which I don't have a problem with.) What bother me is the feeling of inconsistency I get from him. \\n\\n\r\nSPOILER: A perfect example is that he is very willing to maim and torture the delinquents who attack him ruthlessly, but won't allow Brave to kill the creepy old man with the noise coat. This particular choice makes no sense. He should, frankly, not have a problem. In fact, the entire conflict constructed between him and Brave is a major story weakness, as it highlights major inconsistencies in their  characters actions.\\n\r\nEND SPOILER\\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, the female characters are fairly well developed, I felt, particularly the android observer and the blue haired ninja girl, who are the two I like best anyway. That's not to say it wouldn't have been better to get to know them a bit better, and to let the main character's relationship develop a bit further with the two primary potential love interests (blue haired ninja and red haired bimbo), but I was accepting.\\n\\n\r\n(The red haired, airhead bimbo will hopefully not be the one chosen as the end of story romantic interest finally. I am so freakin tired of the dang japanese and their stupid \"many girls, but who do I choose?\"romance anime where the protagonist passes over the awesome, empowered, self sufficient, tsundere female for the retarded, airheaded, naive redheaded(or pink haired) idiot.)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6 fair\\n\r\nSo, overall, my enjoyment was greatly lessened by the fact that it could have been such a better series if they'd have just let it go 24 episodes, and also hired a decent writer to reword the latter half of the series. A bit more character development, beefing up the story world early on so it doesn't fee like they are just making it up as they go to be able to create the final conflict, and a lack of atheist ranting would have greatly increased my enjoyment. I don't know what the final two episodes will hold, and hope that they can change my opinion, but I doubt they will.\\n\\n\r\nThus, overall it was good(7), but it could have been great. It didn't suffer some of the debilitating flaws that many other series like it did, but it still could have used tweaking and lengthening.\\n\\n\r\nHope this review was helpful, if not thought provoking.\\n\r\nRespectfully,\\n\r\n~Daemonblade1229\\n\\n\r\nP.S.\\n\r\nApologies for any spelling errors, but it is rather late. I'll likely tweak it someday, but I leave for 9 weeks of living in the forest soon (I work summers at a Boy Scout camp), so I won't have internet. That's also why i won't be able to see the last two eps until the fall. We all make sacrifices...\\n\\n",

(Energy large enough to destroy a small field) \r\nStory & Character (9/10):\r\nIt isinteresting how the main character tries to clear misunderstandings, but they just get worse off. He is labelled as the demon king by the system and he criticizes the system while trying to reject it and makes his own life worse. The same thing happens with a girl he is trying to impress. This adds the humor element to the story.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10/10):\\n\r\nThis anime does have some ecchi feature so be warned (If you hate ecchi please just don't rate it just on that.

            "content": "Usually, when I start up a harem/ecchi anime, I prepare myself for the onslaught of nonsensical breasts, sporadic panty shots, illogical physics and random facesitting. These are the basics, and anyone who has watched more than one ecchi knows that this is a common theme in all of them. \r\nAnd of course, naturally, these people don't go too hard on the show because \"it comes with the genre,\" and \"you have to look at it as a harem/ecchi.\" \r\nI disagree.\r\nThere is a fundamental problem with ecchi anime that goes overboard. For an anime to be considered a good work, it needs to accomplish things suchas thematic development and effective symbolism, amongst other things, although there are a few exceptions. There are, for sure, aspects such as art and sound that come into play when judging an anime, but when we consider the big picture, that is, the overall score, art and sound comprise 40% of it, while another 40% goes to story and characters, and 20% to enjoyment. Ecchi comes short when trying to develop the story and characters because of its various sexual moments. When an anime uses up screen-time to show these scenes, it loses time to develop the story and characters. In moderate amounts, you could argue for character development, for example, by demonstrating a certain character to be attractive, which may be an integral part to his/her character, but in most cases, you do not need her to jiggle her breasts ten times within the first five minutes to get that point across. When you constantly do this, you lose out in certain areas, which inevitably makes the anime lose points overall.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, Ichiban Ushiro no Daimaou is a stellar example of this phenomenon. The show is, and although I have no hard data to really prove this, half ecchi (and you might as well call some of that \"ecchi,\" hentai). I mean, quite literally, if the show is twelve episodes, and we do the math, that's 4.6 hours. I would go as far as saying that a good 2.3 hours of that time is devoted to some sort of ecchi. When half of your show is ecchi, you will inevitably lose out on the story and character sections. Thus, my ratings for those sections are considerably low. The art and sound are not impacted by this, and that would explain my rather high score for the show's art (I'll explain my sound rating later). Enjoyment is entirely dependent on the individual, and I care quite a bit about story and characters so my score for that is quite low too.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the specifics.\\n\r\n(I MAY HAVE SLIGHT SPOILERS)\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\r\nIchiban Ushiro no Daimaou's story is nothing to praise. To provide a light synopsis for use in this review, the protagonist is supposedly a demon king and the show attempts to produce some sort of message about free thought and goodness through some morally gray situations. However, it is clear that the writers did not understand what the color gray looks like, because what I saw was pure black and pure white. The story is plagued by a lot of typical shounen moments and decisions that have had clear \"right,\" answers. I was not for a second challenged with a question that I found to be considerably controversial. Not to mention, the way the story ends so idyllically ends up toppling whatever the writers accomplished, so even giving points for their attempt is difficult.\\n\\n\r\nThe story also suffers from a lightweight feeling. For example, a lot of things in the story do not have much of a backstory to provide support. Why is the protagonist a demon lord again? Was there any meaning in his status as one? Or what about his rival? What about him? Where did his powers come from? And what is with the convenient arrival thereof? A lot of unexplained questions lead to a lack of weight and the story loses a lot of points in this regard. What about the mystical magic all-powerful sword? It is given, (along with a little trope-tag of \"it'll work when you need it to) yet the weight of this particular weapon weighs more than the entire story. \\n\\n\r\nThe inclusion of random characters is also everpresent in Ichiban Ushiro no Daimaou, although it is to be expected from a typical harem that tries to squeeze in the entire world's population's C cup and above girls into a one mile radius within one day. However, compared to a show like Clannad, where the girls are actually people and not toys for the main character, Ichiban Ushiro no Daimaou prefers to toss all sorts of spices in hoping one of them tastes well to the viewer. The fanservice involving these randomly tossed in characters inundates the viewer. It seemed to me that if there was an explosion, it was ingeniously rigged to blow up in just the perfect manner so as to rip the girls' clothes to shreds but leave their perfect skin and breasts untouched. Can't have bad complexion, now can we?\\n\\n\r\nThere are also some aspects of the story that just seem absolutely childish and idiotic. And for a show like this, where it goes as far as showing off some of the characters nipples (and this is why some may consider this almost a hentai), it clearly is not aimed at children. An ancient slumbering dragon is actually a robotic machination that shoots missiles and hacks computers that the God(s) use to interact with reality is a blasphemous concept. A girl who likes to masturbate in front of her brother's still-alive, preserved head and fantasizing about an evil demon lord? Did they originally attempt for a hentai plot but then forget about it? This sort of consistent foolishness would be acceptable if the show was some sort parody but it is not, and it is simply unnecessary and takes away too much attention from the story's attempts at thematic development (of which there is so little I will not even expand). \\n\\n\r\nThe story is also plagued with a lot of outrageous ecchi elements and tools that become almost intrusive, and at best, laughable. Our little Meena can go invisible, but somehow she hasn't studied magic enough to apply it to her clothing, so she has to go naked. Junko has a habit of only ripping her torso clean off. And Korone has a cute little tail that you need to pull to turn her off. Make sure to get a firm grip boys!\\n\\n\r\nOverall, combined with generic and overused characters, the story is one of the more unoriginal things I've seen. Especially speaking of the backstory elements.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a few merits though that I must give to the story. The attempt is something I consider to be worthy of some points, since I think it is something that isn't found very often in the show's genre. The story is also pretty decent at building up some sort of tension, which is also nice to have. But the merits here are few, and are overwhelmed by the many blemishes.\\n\\n\r\nI give the story a 3.\\n\\n\r\nART\\n\r\nThe art, which also includes animation for me, was actually pretty rock solid. The fighting scenes were well drawn and had great and flashy physics. The scenes also seemed to be running at a great frame rate or had some apt motion blur, or both. A lot of times I could really get into the fight scenes since they looked captivating. They were smooth, cool and sometimes just simply awesome. The characters were for the most part also well drawn (with the exclusion of Hiroshi, who I thought just looked ridiculous). And I'll even go far as saying that those breasts looked great. Really though, the few men there were in this show (as it is a harem) were pretty well drawn and the artists put apt attention to important details and aspects of them, like the protagonist's unique eyes and toned body, or the cocky hair of Bouichirou, the man who challenged the Gods. I would have given it something closer to a 9 if it weren't for some bad inconsistency and coarseness with casual scenes, and the usage of pretty generic and crazy anime hair (although this part is mostly a preference).\\n\\n\r\nI give the art an 8. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\r\nThere's not much to say here since the sound didn't really catch me whatsoever. I was never really captured by moving music in highly emotional parts of the show, or drawn to the screen during a bass filled drum-crazy fight theme, nor was I ever relaxed as I watched characters being casual with a smooth walking theme playing in the background. I do not, for the life of me, actually remember anything slightly noteworthy about the sound. If anything, I remember the OP having awkward and nonsensical lyrics. Overall, nothing amazing here, and since the soundtrack of a show is designed to heighten moments and keep it alive, Ichiban Ushiro no Daimaou fails terribly. \\n\\n\r\nI give the sound a 4. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\r\nI have probably already developed on my critique of the characters in my story section, but regardless, there's much to say here.\\n\\n\r\nNow, granted, since Ichiban Ushiro no Daimaou is a harem, the character quality would decline, and just because it is a harem does not mean all of a sudden you should give it a 6 (Fair). Ichiban Ushiro no Daimaou suffers from what I already described as the harem-character problem, where an interminable stream of characters (usually very attractive and sexualized girls) are shot into the show with little to no justification whatsoever, and this already destroys the score for the show. The characters become lifeless eye candy. You don't remember these characters by their names or by their achievements or by their struggles or their personality, but you remember them by their cup size, hip-waist ratio, and hair color. Oh, and I guess the sexually relevant traits are included too (I like the one who's all shy and doesn't want to have sex but clearly does!!!, etc.).\\n\\n\r\nIchiban Ushiro no Daimaou also has some of the most heavy trope-elements in it, regarding characters, that I've ever seen. Every character in the show is some clear manifestation of some trope. Here are some examples (mind the spoilers, or skip):\\n\\n\r\nKorone: Silent and smart hot girl that doesn't understand the meaning of sexual tact. Also has a conveniently placed off switch in the form of a fuzzy bunny-ball tail. \\n\r\nJunko: Active, tough and independent woman with a soft side for protagonist.\\n\r\nKeena: Onii-chan!!!\\n\r\nMitsuko: Hot teacher with a deep compassion for her students. You can interpret compassion in whatever way you want. Wink.\\n\r\nHiroshi: Dependent young brother that fights for his big bro and becomes powerful. For the yaoi fans out there.\\n\r\n(By the way, I read somewhere that when they were auditioning for the characters, they demanded a cup size of C or above from the ladies.)\\n\\n\r\nI don't particularly hate tropes, they will always be present and you could argue that without tropes there would be no such thing as genres. But tropes can become intrusive when used to such great extent and absolutely demolishes the originality factor. Ichiban Ushiro no Daimaou's cast is a chaotic blend of all sorts of harem/ecchi-suited tropes that provide no sort of unique or refreshing feel whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters also are very two dimensional. Fujiko's little back-story for example is an overused vengeance plot and she overcomes this predicament with such ease and expediency that you really wonder if there was even a point of using that episode for that \"development,\" when they could have just thrown more bare chested Junko at us. At least then, I could have used my imagination, and thus my brain, a bit more. Their back-stories are also, just like their character models, tropes. \\n\\n\r\nWell, at least they look hot. Kind of.\\n\\n\r\nI give the characters a 2.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\r\nThe enjoyment value for this show, for me was pretty low, but is subject to change depending on who is watching it, since I know some people who love ecchi, and others who despise it. \\n\\n\r\nI personally am quite impartial with ecchi, and I am confident that my score for this area is unbiased, or at least, as unbiased as a score for a category named \"enjoyment,\" can be. The enjoyment was low because of the low scores the show receives in all other areas. Simply speaking, I personally do not enjoy bad shows very much. \\n\\n\r\nA lot of the enjoyment points were torn off due to ridiculous and outrageous scenes and unexplained and unanswered questions, all resulting in a slight bit of frustration and definitely a lack of joy. Such as the awkward and unjustified ecchi/almost hentai scenes that usually just made me uncomfortable and not enticed whatsoever. The characters were also too shallow for me to develop real connections and love for any of them, and the sound never heightened my feelings or emotions when watching so as to imprint a positive impression. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, the show is given the genre of \"comedy,\" but it wasn't often that I laughed. There was one or two times where I did smile at a well written dialogue, but it wasn't nearly as often as I should have for my enjoyment factor to rise at all. The show also is classified under a handful of other genres that it all smashed into twelve episodes, leaving me unsatisfied and overstuffed. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the art did help the enjoyment factor a bit (and as expected, I gave it a very high score). The fight scenes, like I have said before, were well detailed and smooth, and I highly enjoyed watching a good punch in the antagonist's face or a vibrant ball of mana/energy being flung across the battlefield, or a dragon flying through the stratosphere. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\r\n4.4 --> 4.\\n\\n\r\nLAST WORDS\\n\r\nIchiban Ushiro no Daimaou is, well, a harem ecchi and you really shouldn't expect any more than just that, and this mentality should be used for essentially every harem/ecchi you run into. You shouldn't run into this show expecting glory, but you shouldn't raise its score just because it chose to give up 40% of the overall score's value.\\n\\n\r\nSeeing my score, I wouldn't recommend this show to anyone unless someone was specifically asking for ecchi, in which case, this cool show shows you a girl masturbating, some fine breasts in their full glory at high resolution and many other unsavory/pleasurable (you decide) things. \\n\\n\r\nAs I like to say:\\n\\n\r\n\"Only in anime.\"\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "***May contain spoilers*** Usually I wouldnt do a review if I agree with the current reviews, but I just HAD to express my opinions on this anime.\r\nTo start, the anime was quite interesting for the first few episodes. I'm not really a fan of the harem genre, but i really liked that the MC seemed to be quite badass and have lots of power. \r\nHowever, the entire concept of \"Brave\" felt super, super stupid and out of place. What a hypocrite. Weak, and given power just because of a suit created by someone else. The \"Hero\" was really lame - the suit looked stupid, andhe was really going against his 'Aniki' all along. I dont get why the MC apologized to the 'Brave' guy at the end cause really it should be the other way around. Brave could've killed the MC and not only that, but went insane for a stupid girl who he barely knew/was an idol who wouldnt even give the Demon King a chance to explain himself or anything.\\n\\n\r\nThe last several episodes were wayyy to rushed. They escalated waayyyy to quickly. So many times I had no idea which side the characters were on, and it felt pretty stupid overall - like this anime tries to have too much going on and fails miserably with it. \\n\\n\r\nSo, overall, I think giving a rating of 5 is being extremely kind. Like i said, pretty decent and interesting beginning, only to get really lame in the middle and utterly stupid by the end. Waste of your time and wouldnt recommend watching it.",

            "content": "Welcome to a magic school that places you based on what you will be after graduating. One boy has been chosen one and was left on the doorstep to be token care of\u2026 welcome to the world of Harry Potter\u2026 er\u2026 I mean Demon King Daimao. But in all seriousness, this show starts out feeling much like a Harry Potter novel then its own thing. \r\nAkudo Sai is a rather interesting character as he wants to be a real holy man with valor so he can be a high Priest but yet ends up in a lot of perverted scenes in seeing women have dressedand up their skirts. He has the feeling of a na\u00efve little boy without being just like Alan from D.Gray Man which would be a little bit over the top. His storyline when he was little is just the same as Harry Potter in that he was left on a doorstep and is considered the hope of someone. \\n\\n\r\nJunko Hattori is a very tomboyish character who at first starts out as a loving friend and then turns her back on him when he is seen as the demon king. Since she follows the Suhara religion, she pretty much is aloud to fight all the time. I don\u2019t really understand why she wears a Fundoshi which looks like a really uncomfortable thing. They show her underwear all the time. \\n\\n\r\nKena Soga seems a bit annoying, and magical girlish. Even though she acts stupid, it seems she is rather smart and her feelings are always true. She may be annoying but I came to like her a little more after each episode. The only thing I don\u2019t like is \\n\\n\r\nKorone has the personality of Yuki from Haruhi Suzumiya and yet she act least jokes. I\u2019m not sure weather or not I actually like her though she does make the show interesting at times. The perverted jokes though do get a bit overboard. For being an android, she seems to love to make fun of all the misunderstandings that happen. \\n\\n\r\nHiroshi Miwa is pretty much the wimpy boy who is always being picked on. He seems exactly like Youhei from Clannad in that he is always following around his \u2018best friend\u2019 for whatever reason. He never seems to think about what he is going to say which makes things even worse for Akudo because most of the misunderstandings are made because of him.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of misunderstandings and the show ends up using them as a comedy skit, many times to the point that sometimes it feels old. Girls always end up in fights where their clothing gets ripped off but it\u2019s not as though it\u2019s as bad as Master of Martial Hearts. In this idea, there is actually a reasoning behind the clothing ripping, not because its tissue paper. The show moves rather fast actually and yet, sometimes it feels a little too fast (I know\u2026 gasp! An anime that goes to fast in its plot!) but still, it makes me feel like I\u2019m missing something.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, it leaves a few questions that I have had, not really explaining much of the full structure. They keep talking about god this and god that but it doesn\u2019t explain much of what that really is. Also, it has some of the feeling from Air: 1000th Summer. Not going to explain how but you will understand when you watch more. They change so many things around and leave it open ended.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is pretty nice and standard, looking a lot like D. Gray Man in how the characters move and the darkness it sometimes has. The ending animation doesn\u2019t hide that this is all a harem in that the main character is seen being paired up with multiple girls at the same time and them all kissing. \\n\\n\r\nI love Akudo\u2019s voice in the English dub, giving him just enough na\u00efve-ness to make him feel innocent but yet at the same time, shows a bit of strength in what he believes in. Chris Patton is pretty good at voicing characters like that well. Greg Ayres is also pretty good at the voice of Hiroshi who is pretty much a minion. This is a guy that does the best as a minion I\u2019m not sold on a couple of the girls voices though since they seem like mostly a hit or miss. Even the music has an air of Harry Potter, making it really hard for me to take seriously. But yet it still has a rather hip and fun feel to it.\\n\\n\r\nThis actually has become one of my favorites.\\n",

            "content": "\"No, Blue is a thousand times better than Red!\"\r\n\"Yellow is a pure maiden.\"\r\n\"Purple has sucked 20 dicks.\"\r\n\"Green is my waifu.\"\r\n\"Peterhausen is obviously the best girl.\"\r\nI'll start by posing a question. What makes an anime good?\r\nAre you perhaps, looking for a great story? One that hooks you from the beginning, and doesn't let your balls go until they're blue and screaming? Maybe characters that grow on you and feel like actual people, or how about stunning visuals that breathe life into the show, and an OST that kicks ass? A masterpiece, if you will?\r\nThen stop reading here, because that's definitely not what the Color Wars is.\r\nHoweverthe Color Wars is one thing. Infinitely entertaining. Explosions, panties, giant tentacle monsters, dragons fighting airships, ninja, pedophiles, and sexual innuendo that pass right over the main characters head, it's all right here. The Color Wars is like watching some of the best and worst things in anime come together and have an explosive tea party. It won't be like anything else you've ever seen, and it won't even make any fucking sense. But I can assure you, it'll be entreating to watch.\\n\\n\r\nWhy is it called the Color Wars? This is simple arithmetic my unobservant friend. Even after spending a substantial amount of time watching the Color Wars, you'll find it challenging to recall the names of the harem members. So how do we refer to these characters? Just call them by their abnormal hair color of course! You've got the rainbow at your disposal, all that's left is to pick your army, and fight with all you\u2019ve got. Throw as much shit as you can at anyone who picks any girl besides your favorite, because they have a disorder my friend. A disorder called Shit Taste.\\n\\n\r\n12 episodes isn't a very long period of time to tell a story. Adaptions seem to suffer from this minuet overlooked detail. The Color Wars doesn't have much of a story; well it does, but it doesn't make much sense. All the details are smashed together, especially in the final episodes, and explanations are locked up like a child who asks too many questions in the basement, never to be seen again.  It doesn\u2019t even matter that the pacing of events is wacked like a drugged hooker. If I have one piece (Shut up, that's not funny) of advice to offer, it's don't take anything anyone in the show says seriously. Decide not to think about anything anymore! \\n\\n\r\nWhile the animation is fairly good, character designs completely lack in any sort of diversity. Green hair goes with green eyes, and blue hair with blue eyes. And just like colors, we've got all sorts of personalities too! Tsunderes, aloof types, lolis, and even a Rei; the fun never really stops. Characters never break out of these cookie cutter archetypes that chain them; not like I ever expected them to anyway. You need to constantly keep in mind that this is a bad harem. I'll reiterate the point, don't think about it.\\n\\n\r\nHowever there is still a group of characters that really get my blood pumping, Primarily Peterhausen (Hah! An alliteration!) and the lead Sai Akuto. Peterhausen is a giant dragon that fights airships and fires drills from his mouth. His character is perfect, never requiring a second of development, by far the best part of the show. Sai Akuto hates the system called god, and would do anything to rebel against an oppressing force. He really keeps the show interesting, playing both the good guy, and the bad guy. While he seems to shy from girls like most harem leads, he also takes shit from no man. You might be surprised at some of his more daring actions.\\n\\n\r\nSo what is a good anime? I think that's mostly up to you to decide, but for me as a general rule, a good anime, is one that achieves what it strives for. The Colors Wars tried to force a horribly written plot down my throat, and I ended up just laughing in its face. By my logic, it isn't qualified to be classified as a good show.\\n\\n\r\nEven though the show misses at its primary target, it still manages to impress me by how over the top and endearing it is. I found myself grinning at the corny lines and colorful fight scenes, even if the context of the situation didn\u2019t quite make sense. In essence, it could be summed up as fun.\\n\\n\r\nBut I need to tell you something Yui. Fun doesn't mean good.\\n",

            "content": "Ichiban Ushiro no Daimaou is a harem series written by Mizuki Shotaro. It was originally a light novel series, which is still going, and got an anime adaptation more recently. I have to say that I have a bad feeling about this one just from the harem and ecchi tags so let's get it over with.\r\nSai Akuto is a transfer student into a prestigious magic academy. He plans to work hard and make the world a better place. When he reports for his physical exam he's told that his future occupation is a demon lord and everyone wants him dead or to get into hispants because free will doesn't exist and he can't just choose a different career or some such nonsense. The plot moves at an absurdly slow pace for most of the series where they introduce minor sub-plots that go absolutely nowhere only to rush through the main story in the last episodes. The plot is cheesy, full of ridiculous cliches and, as if it wasn't bad enough, it gets a deus ex ending. The humour is another factor that utterly fails. How badly? They make a joke about tentacle rape. That's all you really need to know, but if you're curious about the rest of the humour it's mostly tasteless sex jokes.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are flat, one-dimensional cliches. They're about as developed as the cast of Kingdom Hearts. That's how exceedingly bland they are. You can pretty easily predict what each character is going to do shortly after being introduced to them just by being passingly familiar with the tropes they embody. Making their interactions completely uninteresting. \\n\\n\r\nThe art could be well done, if not for one major issue. The fan-service. I know, I complain about fan-service frequently in my reviews, but this has such an excessive level of fan-service that it makes everything else I've reviewed look tame by comparison. It's so bad that it borders on soft-core porn. The fight scenes are dull. They're over far too quickly and, frequently, they're used as a thin excuse to strip the female characters. This anime wouldn't be able to understand how to keep things classy with four years of study under Gail Simone. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting and music are both pretty forgettable. They aren't bad but they aren't anything special either. They just get the job done. \\n\\n\r\nThe yuri factor is a 2/10. There's one scene involving Fujiko, unfortunately it's a rape joke. Most of the time the female characters can't even pass the Bechdel test, much less develop relationships with each other. \\n\\n\r\nMy final rating for Ichiban Ishiro no Daimaou is a 1/10. The series substitutes any kind of depth for ludicrous amounts of fan-service. Add the fact that the humour is repulsive and the characters flat and all you have left is the fan-service and, frankly, if that's what you're looking for you'd be better off just watching hentai.",

            "content": "I really wanted to like this show.  The premise is great, the world has a lot of potential, and there are many things this show does really well.  Despite its gratuitious action scenes which are violent without being overly gory, the show never quite takes itself too seriously, and there are plenty of things to laugh about.  It also has a typical ecchi harem subplot to add a healthy dose of titillation.\r\nDespite all its good points however, it suffers from a single, major flaw, from which all its weaknesses stem: this story is far too ambitious for 12 episodes.\r\nAll the problems ofthis show could have been solved if it extended the same story to two seasons.  There would have been more time to develop the characters and learn the motivations behind the various factions.  It would also give more room for a few filler episodes so that it would feel like there's a middle to this story and not just a beginning and end.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, it's way too confusing.  Again, this has to do with the fact that there's not enough time in 12 episodes to develop the plot.  Also, there are too many factions with various goals.  It's not a simple good-guys-vs-bad-guys show (which, admittedly, is to be expected from a show where the hero is a demon lord).  Instead, you have various groups vying for power.  When they all come to a head in the final episodes, it's hard to know who to root for because you don't know their motivations.  Heck, they even introduce some new factions right in the final battle who show up just to add confusion to an already confusing plot.\\n\\n\r\nIt all gets sorted out in the end, though.  I must admit, I really like the resolution to the show.  The hero fulfills his role as Demon Lord better than anyone could have hoped and worse than anyone could have feared, while somehow still managing to remain a good guy.  The final resolution is good enough to counter a lot of the problems of the show.  Not quite enough to break even though, so I give the whole thing a 3.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\\n\r\nNothing spectacular, but I can't really complain about anything.  The character designs are fine.  It has a great looking dragon.\\n\\n\r\nNotes on fanservice: There's a little nudity, but too often they employ convenient censorship.  I mean, how can you have a girl (Keena) whose magic depends upon her being nude, yet somehow limit her frontal nudity to one brief scene?\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\\n\r\nI score it this high because of the theme song.  This is the one thing the show does perfectly.  Normally it takes me three or four times listening to the theme song of an anime show before I really like it, but this one hooked me right from the very first time.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, let me take just a moment to comment on the opening credits.  Totally badass!  Easily my favorite opening of any anime.  The theme song is great, right from the beginning with the electric guitar introduction and especially where the mana gauge cranks up to max just as the bass starts playing.  I like the nightmarish imagery of Akuto running through the city and encountering all the different characters in the show.  I get chills when the dragon bursts out of the ground and at the brief closeup of Akuto's red eyes.  This is the perfect opening credits for an action anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5\\n\\n\r\nThere's no time to really develop the characters enough to make them particularly interesting.  The result is some canned characters that don't have enough time to establish themselves before they're forced to make life-changing decisions in the final episodes.  The result is that we don't really understand them, therefore we can't empathise with them, therefore their motivations are confusing.  That's not to say the characters aren't likable; they are.  They're just not developed.\\n\\n\r\nOne other note:  Personally, if I were the hero, I would just run away with Keena (after investing in the world's biggest rice cooker).  Forget destiny.  I know she's a bit of an airhead, but she's the only one who accepts him just for who he is, and doesn't care that he's a demon lord.  Can you tell who my favorite character is?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\\n\r\nThe show has some strengths and weaknesses.  There are some great moments, like the battle between the dragon and the flying battleship, the most absurdly comical resolution to a battle I've ever seen in Episode 3, and \"I'm going to betray you all\" in Episode 11.  If only these scenes were fit into a cohesive plot... sigh.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, the confusing subplots ruined this for me.  There were some great parts, but not enough to overcome its weaknesses.\\n",

Making it funny at a lot of parts, also with the ecchi in it makes it even more unserious. \r\nAlso i this anime has some\u00b4nasty\u00b4things in this anime wich are pretty much hillarious with the reactions of the characters. If you dislike these \u00b4wrong\u00b4 anime\u00b4s, please do not watch it. It\u00b4s supposed to be an funny anime with some serious moments in it.\r\nOverall on of these anime who wont be rated highly bad at an avarage of a 6/7, i think it\u00b4s a 7 whichis an honnest personal rating. I want to go over the parts which determine my conclusion about this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is well yeay not unique but epic. the reactions and behaviour of this anime is pretty much in sync with the storyline which i like and also i think that this anime made the excecution decent enough but not as good as the more highly rated anime\u00b4s.\\n\\n\r\nArt, uhh cute girls with a clumsy unknowing boy, that\u00b4s well yeay kinda the same as all echhi and romantic anime\u00b4s wich well yeay i like the idea and all but well yeay it\u00b4s getting old. the art in general is well produced but the small details could\u00b4ve gotten a bit more work.\\n\\n\r\nSound, bad excecuted standart sounds and kinda  a lack of background sounds. but well yeay. that\u00b4s with all of these anime with a couple of exceptions ofcours. not something to look out for.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\u00b4s haha nice this is what i like about this, on of these anime who did something about this. all characters have a different role and a meaning in the future of the episodes. well produced and some unique extra material wich is awesome.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment is kinda a personal question so watch it and give your own. i think it was extremely enjoyable but more to say isn\u00b4t there.\\n\\n\r\nSo?\\n\r\nA decent and unserious anime with a lot of funny moments and echhi. \\n\r\nwould rate 7. not to special but if you feel like having a fun time, watch it. if you want to watch anime that are serious and want you to learn something. please dont watch.\\n\\n\r\nEchhi, romance, action, harem style anime lovers, watch this anime please\\n\r\nPeople who want to laugh and dont mind echhi and such, watch this anime.\\n\r\nPeople who want an anime wich is serious and realistic, please dont.\\n\\n\r\nSorry about my English, it's not perfect.

            "content": "This spring's animes really gives a lot to think about.. I wonder if the parade of gags, parody and eros are medicine for those starting a new life, or just a sign that the industry is falling into an endless limbo. \r\nStory: 6 \r\nLike many of the animes this season, the synopsis is catchy enough to attract many fans. It's hard to resist the temptation of an anti-hero who is labeled a demon king from the very start. Compared to the other animes this season, it isn't too bad either. The story is, although very questionable at times, very fast-paced and keeps your eyes onthe screen and your mind on the next best thing this anime is going to slam in your face. In essence, the story has no seriousness and could have been better with a little more philosophical sense, but of course you can't expect an anime trying to appeal eroticism and comedy to have such depth. However, there is a lot of potential in the story nonetheless. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nCompared to a lot of the visual headaches I have seen this season, at least this one stands out among the rest. It's not enough to go up against kyoani and key, but it's a real saviour. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nUnless you really want some good songs and bgms, it won't bother you much. As expected of a gag-filled harem anime, anyways.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nThe main character is the type i have absolutely no complains about. He's the perfect anti-hero who is able to stay calm while the whole world around him goes crazy. In contrast, the harem girls have so little character they're just good for the visual experience and unstoppable gags.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nI've very much tired myself of harems which portray nothing but idiotic and shallow eroticism, but I must say this anime has introduced a different enjoyment to me. I still think that it would be a lot better if they scraped most of the eros and put more thought to the plot, though. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\r\nCompared to the other spring animes, this one is probably a gem amongst them, but still not good enough to be a noticeable winner.",

            "content": "Well, I have to say this one was pretty hard to rate.  I really want to give this anime an 8 or maybe even a 9, but I'll have to settle on something lower because there are some flaws that are just too big to ignore.\r\nLet's start with the story.  This is why it's so hard to rate.  It actually has a good story.  But the pacing is pretty hard to cope with.  The first 7 or 8 episodes are mostly character development with little bearing over the overall plot.  This guy comes to a magic school wanting tobecome a high priest and help mankind as much as possible.  So then there's his physical when he enters his new school that also acts to predict the future occupation of students.  And our here gets to be.....that's right a Demon Lord.  King of all the demons in the world and somewhat opposing to his \"I'll do my best to help everyone\" mentality.  That's all well and good until the main plot begins to move somewhere around episode 7.  Then you get this massive, somewhat complicated plot that other anime 24+ episodes long would have trouble fitting in.  And this one is only 12.\\n\\n\r\nIt seems like this one tries to be the anti-Bleach/One Piece/Naruto and just does its best to not be longer than 12 episodes.  No.  Matter.  What.  And so the last 4 episodes generally leaves you a little unsatisfied because it moves so fast and leaves out any explanations of the situation that would serve to either make the anime longer or make the plotline comprehensible.  I just finished watching this series today, and I've spent quite a lot of time just trying to figure out how I should rate it all.  The story is actually quite decent if you can grasp most of what's going on in the last few episodes, but it feels so rushed I've thought about rating it anywhere from a 4 to a 9 because of it.  So, for putting 97% of a massive, complex, and pretty decent story into a blender and serving it all in just a few episodes, I'm giving the story a 6.  I'm going to touch on more of the story later in the enjoyment section, like the harem and ecchi points, so stay tuned.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on, I think I'll combine the art and sound.  Both are good but not spectacular, fairly generic at times, and that's about it.  They don't take anything away from the show and don't make the show stand out either.  So the art and sound departments get a solid 7 from me.\\n\\n\r\nNext I'll go into the characters.  The main character is Sai Akuto.  Like I said before he wants to help people as much as possible and has high aims to reach that goal.  The first episode makes sure to show him as being one to help as much as he can, even if the situation he has fallen into seems to have made it impossible to really help people.  He's not your standard magical harem kind of main character though.  He's one of the more likable, yet misunderstood characters I've seen in a main character role.  So, enter harem of girls.  Hattori, Korone, Etou sempai, and Soga are the girls.  They all have unique points, but are overall mostly generic.  If you watch, you'll see what I mean.  And Hiroshi is the obligatory male friend who worships the future Devil Lord.  He's quite funny early on but later, his character changes completely and I don't know if I like it or not.  I give the characters an 7 because I really liked the characters early on, but in the onrush of the plot, some of the characters' personalities changed quite a bit with no explanation or really any warning of a change.  \\n\\n\r\nNow for the enjoyment part.  I really enjoyed the show early on.  In the first 5 or so episodes the humor was incredibly lewd and just plain fun.  There was a whole lot of ecchiness in the show.  Really the front half of the show was bursting at the seams with ecchiness.  But it was hilarious and super enjoyable as well.  Around the midpoint of the show though, all that is turned down to a just somewhat ecchi show, and in the last few episodes is the action of the plot with no room for humor or hardly any ecchiness at all.  That coupled with the unreal expectation of fitting that plot into 4 episodes dropped my enjoyment from a 10, but I still give it a 9.\\n\\n\r\nI would reccomend this show to most people, but I would also warn everyone to pay attention carefully in the last 5 episodes cause if you miss anything, you really might not understand the plot at all.  So, because of the extreme rushed feel to the last half of the anime, I have to give the show as 7, no higher.",

I think it could have had a lot more success as a 24-26 episode series because the story seems too complicated to be explained in half that. Anyone who loves Zero No Tsukaima or similar anime should enjoy a bit more ecchi version of it or similar anime. Its character development was alright but i feel like the end of one episode didn't directly lead into the next and sometimes leaves you wondering what thehell happened in between.",

            "content": "Okay, Ichiban Ushiro no Daimaou, or \"Demon Lord furthest in the back\" or whatever it is that you want to call this series, starts off with a basic setup, boy meets girl, boy helps girl (actually helped her grandmother who was helping her, kids these days, huh?), boy shares aspirations to become big-shot good guy, boy and girl swear allegiance. It also seems to involve magic. This would be a good start to an anime where the Main Character becomes a hero. It isn't.\r\nAs soon as MC gets to school he is put through a rigorous health and well-being test, also known as a smoking,bespectacled bird in a jar. Who also tells the future, specifically the future job of the person under inspection. This all takes three seconds. And shocking twist, MC turns out to be destined to become a Demon Lord. Such a good setup, this anime should be interesting!\\n\r\nIt's from about this point that things all go awry.\\n\r\nWhy does it go awry? Well, let's start with my ratings.\\n\r\nStory: 3\\n\r\n\"Why did you give it a three, you just told us that the story was set up so well, how can anyone mess it up?\" I hear you asking. It's rather simple really, the extent of the plot and the story.\\n\r\nNow, don't get me wrong, the story isn't actually that bad, for a 50 episode series, 26 at a push, the problem with it is that the story is jammed into 12 episodes. You can literally see the anime bursting at the seams by how much story it's trying to hold in. I quite frequently got confused by a turn of events simply because of the lack of development and potential forshadowing, and the final four episodes or so felt like a two hour slog *per episode* that much story is crammed in. It goes from a fairly light, gag-based setting, where panty shots are routine, to suddenly the world has been flipped upside-down, shit got serious somewhere off-screen, and panty shots are routine. The lack of development in the major areas of the story had me almost reaching for the stop button in the final few episodes.\\n\r\nThe magic system in this anime felt tacked on as an afterthought almost, as a body to convey the fact that weird shit is happening, and indulge in too much nudity.\\n\r\nCharacters: 3\\n\r\nAs a consequence of the above crammed story, the characters come off as one-dimensional, and unrelatable. The main Love Interest (and good luck trying to pick EXACTLY which one of five girls this is supposed to be, the OP and ED don't help this cause) regularly flip-flops between support and understanding, and hatred and anger, all with love underlying it, something that is never developed.\\n\r\nMC is no exception to the one-dimensional characterisation that was caused by the jam-packed storyline. In the first episode, prior to learning his future occupation, he claims that he want's to become High Priest of all things Holy, Just and Pure (so much so that apparently littering would cause him to loose all chances). This is so that he can fulfil his wish of helping all those worse off, later the wish becomes to change \"God\", and finally to destroy \"God\", all with little indication of what happened in between.\\n\r\nOf the rest of the main cast, which is very thin on the ground, there is Evil Witch (who tries to promote the Demon Lord), Creepy Stalker (An android sent to keep an eye on the Demon Lord), Love Interest #2 (Ditzy), #1 Follower (Complete with catch-phraise \"Aniki!\") and Evil Bitch (nemesis of Love Interest #1). Add a giant dragon that knows more than it lets on and there is your cast, and motivations. Things get a little complicated when #1 Follower gets Powers Of His Own, but that doesn't result in much.\\n\r\nSecondary Cast includes another potential love interest (also Student Council President), the school nurse (and MC's homeroom teacher), and a bunch of people who really only serve to deliver a handful of lines.\\n\r\nI gave Art and Sound 7 simply because there wasn't much I could fault it on, it worked, the art got across more than the story could manage (not saying much) and the sound was everything you could want from a soundtrack, it didn't get in the way. Otherwise, nothing outstanding.\\n\r\nMy enjoyment of this series was limited. I've harked on enough about the presentation of the story, so I won't bore you any more with that. As a result, enjoyment got a 3.\\n\r\nOverall I gave this a 5, due to the bonus marks from art and sound and for having a good basic idea, but I had to fight for that high a mark, simply because of how much I was disappointed with it. The mood flip-flopped (as often as Love Interest #1's mood) between light-hearted, gags and nudity to Serious Shit. I would watch an anime that expanded on the story so things made more sense and they fixed the pacing issues, but wouldn't recommend watching this series.",

Despite the misunderstanding you would\u2019ve thought that they would become great friends, do all great activities, jump off a cliff or something. After Akuto successfully enrolling in to the Magical Academy he\u2019s been told by this fortune teller artificial being that he\u2019ll become a demon king, which will go further introducing the other main characters of this anime. An Android Girl who observes Akuto, but ends up seducing him. A naked invisible girl, Agoody two shoes guy that loves justice and another girl that uses Black Magick that wants to use the powers of the demon king for her own purposes, who I still believe that she has a freaky brother complex :l You can obviously see that this will turn in to a harem, by the end.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nI never took the characters seriously in the anime, because the drama that they were trying to show, when they were either having an argument or a fight was a hit or miss. That\u2019s the only problem I had with every character of this series, but some of them had a unique quirk, which make me like them. Unfortunately when time comes I will forget some of the characters in this series, but I\u2019ll always remember the android, red hair elf and the demon king. Lastly I did like the designs of the magick beast especially the Dragon, who served the demon king :D.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nI didn\u2019t paid attention towards the animation, but I did notice the animation was quite different within the fighting scene, which I did like.\\n\\n\r\nAmusement:\\n\r\nI really liked the comedy of this anime even though I didn\u2019t like the drama, but that didn\u2019t stop me from creating a big smile on my face while going through these episodes! :D\\n\r\nOverall: I believe that this is an anime you could enjoy. It isn\u2019t really the anime you would take very seriously, since it is a harem, ecchi and comedy. I\u2019m sure that you\u2019ll remember the comedy of this series and the main protagonist since he\u2019s basically also a villain in this anime. Weird ehh.\\n\r\nThis anime deserves a 7 out of 10 :D\\n\r\nIf you liked Ichiban then I would recommend,\\n\r\nMaburaho \u2013 Same genres and similar plot, but the main powers of the main protagonist are switched. I\u2019m sure you would remember this anime, since the opening music will haunt me inside my brains! XD\\n\\n\r\nZero no Tsukaima \u2013 I recommend the first season of The familiar of zero, since it\u2019s got the same genres, but the plot is different.\\n\\n\r\nDNA2 \u2013 The genres are different, but the plot is similar. Even though this anime got created in the 90s, but hear me when did you ever read in a plot of an anime that the protagonist has impregnated a 100 women in the future and he\u2019s referred as the mega-playboy come on! The last thing that would be similar to this is B gata H kei!",

Other than that, they were your typical harem bunch: the tsundere (and I normally don't mind tsundere characters, but this one was just...idk- all I know is I didn't care for her), the android-girl-with-no-emotion, etc. Even the main character Akuto Sai who starts off a pretty okay character (mildly curious, and a good-guy-who-is-thought-to-be-bad-by-everyone-but-is-actually-good) just gets boring after a while.",

            "content": "What a miserable downward spiral of infodumping. I don't know anything about the source material, but clearly the producers of this anime tried (and spectacularly failed) to cram like three seasons into twelve episodes without considering what makes the show any good.\r\nI wouldn't particularly consider this one a harem story--although there are obvious scenarios of ecchi sluts begging for Demon King railing; rather, this is an OP antihero changing his destiny to become the hero by tossing off the chains of fate. Or, you know, it would be that simple if the writers had stuck to a linear increase in backstory, worldbuilding, and explaining howall this magic/demon king/hero stuff works over the course of the series. But that would require tact and restraint which are obviously complex techniques, so instead we get about eight episodes of cheery magic fun times then four-ish episodes of encyclopedia-cramming by people who get overexcited when approached with the opportunity to flex their nerdity in front of normies.\\n\\n\r\nThere are other spoiler-ridden plot reviews here, so I'll just skip past that. What I enjoyed immensely about Ichiban Blah Blah are the characters. The protagonist is an overpowered Harem King Lite while his chief bimbos are a tough ninja with a soft side, a libido-powered lust queen, and a robot with a monotone voice who calls everyone perverts. Pretty cliche stuff. But a lot of people often label cliches as inherently evil simply because they're regularly done in poor taste; Ichiban Blah Blah takes the cliches and makes them enjoyable to the point where it doesn't matter. After all, Tibetan zero gravity cross-stitching tutorials are supposed to be entertaining, and even if there's nothing groundbreaking it can still achieve that benchmark by being well produced. And this one is.\\n\\n\r\nThe dub (GASP TIME TO CLICK REPORT DUB EVIL EVIL MUST PROTECT ANIMU INTEGRITY REEEEE) actors all do a great job with the exception of that little shit Miwa whose prepubescent voice feels like getting giant rock dildos shoved into my ears. Animation is all top-tier and smooth, along with the sound effects and music. In reality, Ichiboohoo should get way closer to 8/10 or higher; sadly, the colossal infodump of meaningless and unimportant things towards the latter third of the show is stupid and unenjoyable. Not only that, the \"hurr god evil must kill god durrr\" plot device comes across as exceedingly edgy in the last episode, kind of like that dumb emo kid in high school who wrote edgy poetry and had a Myspace full of pictures with ketchup smeared on his arms and a butter knife center-frame. \\n\\n\r\nIs it worth watching? Yeah, I think so. Just be prepared for the infodumping. And for fellow *plot* connoisseurs, you will be pleased as well.",

            "content": "If you expect anything more than a harem anime from this harem/comedy anime you're in for a bad time. The problem is that this anime serves up some plot faster than you can pop a pop tart which drag down the harem/comedy that starts out strong.\r\nWe can sum this anime up as quoted from a character: \"I found the rest but I just can't find my panties[plot].\" ...possibly because the plot is like air, its everywhere but you can't really see it, just feel it. Yeah I don't really get this analogy either.\r\nWhat could have been a half decent harem/comedy anime with a semi interestingmain character (because he's not the goody do-er that's overused in these types of anime) instead attempts to focus a little too much on overall plot which leads to its downfall. Though it bombards the viewer with girls of all types and interests leading to sexy scenarios with our MC, the overall plot keeps driving new developments that take away from the comedy and harem aspects that the first few episodes excel at. And obviously nobody is really watching this for the plot. So turn off that brain and watch a few episodes if that's your fetish. Otherwise there's better anime other there for either harem, or plot, and maybe a bit of both as well. (Sekirei, Familiar of Zero, Kampfer, World only God Knows, Rosario Vampire, etc). By better I mean, at least the pacing and the story are told better than this anime.\\n\\n\r\nStory - Starts off strong. Rapid development after first arc is as unexpected as its unnecessary. Ending even more rapid than the middle episodes. The ending is so extremely rushed even the fans of the series audibly complained about how a second season could have been made out of the last 5-6 episodes alone.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - Lots of characters. Character development on the four that stand out the most is actually decent. The bad: Rushed plot means extreme change with several characters that is so absurd and uninteresting that you'll lose interest in them..\\n\\n\r\nArt - Some of the fight scenes were well animated. However, equally there were many scenes that were lazily animated as well (not talking about panty shots though). \\n\\n\r\nSound - Its fine, nothing special here.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - The most enjoyable parts of this anime were the first handful of episodes which was strictly more about harem/comedy than whatever the plot is supposed to be. The action was \"ok\". Generic at times and not very memorable.\\n\\n\r\nOVerall: I would have given this a 5 if it only considered the first few episodes where the anime starts off strong. Unfortunately the last four episodes brought it down a notch with its pacing.\\n\\n\r\nWatch this: There is a dragon named Peterhausen. If you'd name your dragon Peterhausen then you should definitely watch this.\\n\\n\r\nDont watch: There is a dragon named Peterhausen. If that sounds like a stupid name for a pretty awesome looking dragon don't watch this.",

            "content": "This show is horrid. Absolutely terrible. It was fun for maybe two seconds, but it just got worse and worse, and I hated it more and more the longer I watched it. Where to even begin with this trainwreck?\r\nBelieve it or not, the main problem is not the insane exploitative nudity. That certainly is a problem, though. You can only see boobs so many times before they stop being funny, sexy, or even uncomfortable. But that isn't the main problem. There are two main problems with this show.\r\nThe first problem is that the plot is rushed, confusing, unclear, and terrible in both idea and execution.I barely had any clue what was going on, and nothing was happening that made me want to know. Things just sort of happen, who cares about coherence. The main plot comes out of nowhere maybe 2/3 of the way through the show, is too much too fast, and doesn't have a satisfying conclusion.\\n\r\nBut my main issue is a moral issue. I believe in God, and this show hates God. It's not humanist, it's not anti-fatalist, it's not agnostic. It just hates God. There is no other way to say it. The main character is an atheist who thinks that God is just a system, and literally (and by literally I literally mean LITERALLY) tries to kill God at the end. Our hero, ladies and gentlemen. He seems nice, I guess, except for when he puts down people who believe in God. And I wouldn't care as much if this show was just critical of religion. But there is no intelligence at all to its claim. There is one point where they state that life is about relationships with people, not religion. But when the time comes for the show to actually put its cards on the table, it cops out. What saves the day at the end is plot contrivance BS that comes out of nowhere and has no rhyme or reason. And the final result is that the whole plot never really happened. There are topics that can be discussed about religion, such as bad things happening to good people, with a loving (or at least intelligent) God. But this show raises a question, doesn't answer it, and acts like it won the argument.\\n\r\nThis show is a stupid harem show for the first half and a morally reprehensible, intellectually bankrupt, pretentious trainwreck for the second half. I barely know what I watched, I just know I hate it. I don't even think I would like it if I were an atheist, because it is not smart in any way. Stay the hell away from this show.",

I can't just completely disregard the enjoyment I did receive from the show other than that. I will definitely have to re-watch the last couple episodes. the show itself was a really fresh take on a played out subject. there are countless Demon Lord animes and this one was kind of a fresh plot that I've yet to see.Thecharacters in the show are very odd, there are the token loli, tsundere, and kuudere, of course but the character development was quite interesting with both Akuto and Keena. I would definitely not call this a harem anime because it really isn't. It's been a minute since I've seen an anime where the weak best friend is their rival so that was also fresh. I think the biggest issue with this anime for me personally is the wildly complex ending that  completely took over the story and made a 180 with the protagonist\u2019s motives. within one episode he went from saying he was not the Demon King  to saying he was going to kill God, once again I have absolutely no clue how this came about. I saw the swiped opportunity for it to come by the clip of him doubting God when he was a child but still how the fuck did his friend almost being assassinated lead to needing to kill God. as you can tell I'm still very Shook Up by this.",

            "content": "Daimaou is a trainwreck, but a fun one.  For the first part of the show, you get a slice of life that is sort of a cross between Devil is a Part Timer and Baka-Test.   Our protagonist just wants to be a nice guy, but who has been titled \"demon king\" by this show's equivalent of the Hogwarts sorting hat.  So he gets involved in all sorts of goofy situations against his will.\r\nIn this first part you are treated to some goofy action, light comedy and fan-service.  But this is some pretty serious fan-service, you will even get to seesome nipples, what a treat!  Throughout this arc, it's evident that is light-hearted, and has a parody vibe when it portrays \"serious\" situations, battles, or sob-backstories.  Easy, cheap, and relatively effective entertainment, though nothing incredible.\\n\\n\r\nThen we get to the second part of the show, the final 3-4 episodes.  All comedy and fan-service flies out the window and we are treated to this enormous \"final battle\" involving every character.  This is where everything gets hilariously terrible, in a good way.  The writing quality here can easily compete with your average hentai.  You have no idea who's fighting who or for what reasons; people are changing sides constantly; characters that you don't even know about are making their \"big comebacks\".  It can't even stay consistent over 3 lines of dialog.  Think Guilty Crown cranked up to 11 in terms of terrible.  I was just wondering in a sort of awe as absolutely nothing made sense, how it continuously raises the stupidity to a new level.  This is definitely entertaining, but please god, don't take it seriously.\\n\\n\r\nThe absolutely dreadful animation and soundtrack just make it that much harder to take anything seriously.  It's a bit of a shame, because during this final section, you can see small seeds of good ideas here and there.  You get a faint doubt that this show could have been actually decent with more budget and 24 episodes to flesh out those plot points.  After all, the characters are decent, although one-dimensional.  Lots of them manage to stay likeable.  But alas, things are what they are and Daimaou will have to remain as a \"parody\".  \\n\\n\r\nI would definitely recommend seeing it if you enjoy watching things ironically (and enjoy tits), just don't expect any Victor Hugo here.",

By flowers I mean boobs and good jokes, also by bloom I mean they're not just thrown in without a plan.\r\nThe first few times I was looking for something to watch and tried out this weird show the initial minute turned me away by giving a massive angsty teens world vibe and I switched to other stuff. I was greatly mistaken, it picks up the pace really well after that and alreadyby the end of the first episode you have a good grasp of the direction of the whole season.\\n\\n\r\nWhile a small number of parts in the plot were sort of weak a surprising amount of the rest was surprisingly good. Not only that but it even comes with some good twists and turns, additionally when it just needs to move along it often does so with an amusing event. Without a terrific set of characters none of that would be possible and quite frankly the only low quality characters are a few bad guys.\\n\\n\r\nAs with the vast majority of ecchi shows you can expect the strongest point to be comedy and it is indeed a really strong one, most viewers who don't take things too seriously should get some loud laughs out of many situations. Lastly and most forgettably the art and sound are both really good, not that you're likely to notice or remember thanks to the general high pace.",

Well, everything.\r\nIt had the basis idea of a demon king, which learns in school and pretty much everybody are scared of him, and with some other scenes it makes the show really funny.\r\nBut let's see... a comedy show isn't enough, right? so let's add \"Action\", let's make that demon king Overpowered and make magic exist (it was horrible, none of the attack moves was \"good\", they just made a magic circle and shot out some lame magic).\r\nHmm, people won't be satisfied, since the action lacks and the comedy is becomes redundant and boring.\r\nSo let's add a lot of nudity whereevery girl in this anime gets stripped for one reason or another or when a HUGE EXPLOSION OCCURS and guess what, HER CLOTHES ARE ALL RIPPED.\\n\r\nOh, and every two minutes there's a random panty shot out of nowhere.\\n\r\nNow comes the romance part, since the ideas until now didn't do any good, romance was added.\\n\r\nPOORLY MADE.\\n\r\nThey started the idea of romance, and then just collapsed it on everything else, making the other genres even WORSE.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 2/10\\n\r\nUh, there wasn't a story. But there were many random parts of beginnings of other stories which came together.\\n\r\nAnd that \"story\" was pretty bad.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nI didn't find the art anything special, and also wasn't too colorful or attractive.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 3/10\\n\r\n\"Are you even trying?\" fits here. They took the OP song and just put it every few minutes as a \"background theme\".\\n\r\nOP was fine though.\\n\r\nED was too bad that I didn't listen to it much.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4/10\\n\r\nIn characters, they could do something FINE, I guess.. They started a few characters' personalities, of course they weren't done.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment:\\n\r\nIn my list I gave it 5, since in my ratings I compare this anime to others, and I haven't watched many anime shows I don't like, so I can't compare it well (I mostly drop those I don't like, this show wasn't one of them.. why? because I hoped for something good to happen, that didn't happen).\\n\r\nHere I give it 4/10, which is pretty much the average of the aforementioned parameters.\\n\\n\r\nRecommended to... Those who seek random panty shots and have enough patience to bear with a boring plot.\\n\r\nNot Recommended to... Anyone who seek for a decent anime, in every genre of it.",

            "content": "This anime is pretty darn interesting! (what a dull introduction).\r\nI mean for a harem/ecchi anime, it was just pure mindless fun. The thing that needs to be noted though is that this shouldn't be taken too seriously. If you are expecting deep character development and an amazing story line, then this anime isn't for you!\r\nNow for the rest of you... I'm gonna keep this short (hopefully) since it's my first review.\r\nIf you are feeling down or your brain needs a rest after writing a 10 000 word thesis, Ichiban Ushiro no Daimaou is a pretty good cure to prevent you from slitting your wrists. Noneed to think deeply about plot twists, or your life problems... Just sit back, watch and enjoy...\\n\\n\r\nI do have to warn viewers that I had low expectations for this so I may be kinda biased haha, don't worry though it shouldn't be too bad.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nIt's a harem/ecchi anime, there really isn't much of a plot till you start reaching the end of the show and even then you'll hardly care much for the plot. It's mostly just a bunch of entertaining characters doing stupid or perverted stuff, which you should be expecting anyway when looking at this genre.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nIt really depends on the person if they enjoy the artwork style. To me I feel consistency is most important and there's absolutely no problem here. If anything, the animation is pretty good, implementing CG effects throughout the show as well as beautifully drawn female characters (duh!).\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe opening and ending songs are suitable for an anime in this genre. They are neither catchy or memorable. Again, this is just opinion. Music throughout the show seems non-existent, you'll hardly know it's even there.\\n\r\nAs for the voice acting, I've only seen the Japanese dub and there was no problem here. In fact the voice actors/actresses are pretty well known (Yuuki Aoi, Toyosaki Aki, etc) so good quality acting is most likely guaranteed.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe characters are pretty much your one dimensional females (its a harem anime what do you expect!). Despite this, you are bound to like at least one of them depending on what your ideal girl is.\\n\r\nAs for the main character Akuto -  he certainly isn't one of those typical main guys who seems to either be an ass, *cough* Makoto Itou *cough* or a pussy. In fact, he is a bad ass character who seems to have appeared from an action anime. He is the only one that develops in this anime. He tells us his ideals which are pretty admirable or agreeable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nAgain I have to reiterate that this anime is for pure fun. It should be watched when you are bored and it shouldn't be taken too seriously. If all these factors are taken into account, I would have to say that this is definitely one of the most memorable and funny HAREM/ECCHI animes that I have seen. I also think that this is quite underrated, probably because it's in this genre and no one can take it seriously.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score is 7.5/10 (can't get half ratings, but I'm trying to be nice here!) purely for the reason that it's the first and only harem/ecchi anime that will stick in my head compared to the hundreds that are out there.",

Already we have multiple female characters in love with Sai Atkuto for no good reason at all and a 'mysterious' organization targeting him. Most of the gags are just reused garbage from other harem shows. The only thing the show still has going for it isthe art. For which I must admit is a guilty pleasure for me. Hopefully this can turn around, but at this point I think not.",

            "content": "Demon King Daimao is basically about a young man name Akuto Sai being predicted by a machine that he is going to be the next Demon Lord, or destroyer of the world, and how he fights \"destiny\" to change his fate.\r\nStory: Ichiban Ushiro no Daimaou or Demon King Daimao,is about Akuto Sai, a young man enrolling in a magic high school to one day become a high priest. He basically wants to be someone like Gandhi bringing peace and harmony throughout the world but is told by the extremely accurate fortune telling machine that he will be a Demon Lord, or the next Adolf Hitler.So from the beginning he is constantly harassed by his fellow schoolmates. There are however a few people that actually tries to befriend him and understand his situation rather than seeing him as a monster. Many things happens that makes him look even more as a monster bent on destroying the God Suhara. Once he realizes that it is almost impossible to escape from his role as the next Demon Lord, he goes against God Suhara, hoping to change the system that is making people accept their fate base on their ability to use magic and the fortune telling machine.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The characters looks pretty good, but the scenes they are in looks quite average. There isn't a lot of elaborate or beautiful scene. The anime itself just stick close to the plot and keeps it that way so that is pretty nice, though I would have liked it if they paid a little more time to make the scenes more detailed.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound was ok and the theme song was pretty good. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The character are alright. What makes this anime quite different from many that I have watched is that it doesn't really bother to go in detail on background stories. It completely focus on Akuto Sai and that is about it. There is barely any character development that can be noticed, beside Akuto on how he chooses to change his fate. So the plot moves by really quick in this 12 episode series.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Personally I enjoyed this series again. It was extremely short, and the plot seemed kind of undeveloped, making this series to go by in a blink of an eye. Also the shortage of character development is easily seen in this series. Though I really like the \"rebellion\" idea, how Akuto tries to defies his predetermine \"destiny.\" Also the idea of being the \"Demon Lord\" was also kind of cool. Wish there were more fighting scenes though or like he was able to use more of his powers. Well hope you enjoy this anime!",

Now to expand on this\r\n1)It started off ok, it felt very generic, nothing too amazing, ive been there done that,but at number 2) it got a bit better with the demon lord twists, his reactions, the ecchi scenes were a bit explicit for this anime and i got bored of them... i mean how much can boobs bounce... Anyways, i guess the demon lord twists was good. \\n\\n\r\n3) Ok, so now this dude is wearing a power rangers suit, with all these new powers, tears a page out of the book King Arther, or however you spell it, and then slaps it into the anime with all the other crap inside. \\n\\n\r\n4) At here i had no idea what was going on, it suddenly jumped form a good straight story line to a room where nuclear fusion was occuring, high pressure, high temperature (10,000,000 degree C), all the particles bouncing everywhere, trying to escape... And what made it worse was all that crappy \"i die for my friends, i die for love, the power of love....\" could it BE any more cliche (see what i did there :P, if you know chandler from friends you will laugh)\\n\\n\r\n5) The anime ended very quick, i was like wtf just happened, who the hell is the red hair girl now that we know the truth, why do i see dejavu, can someone actually explain to me what the hell is happening. Why is everything repeating, why is he the demond lord again... It made no sense WHAT SO EVER!\\n\\n\r\nWhat i did like about this anime, as i have already mentioned is the unorthodox aproach where the protagonist wants to be a preist yet turns out to be a demon, but became very cliche.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, i have to say this atleast desrves a 7 for the good effort, but lost alot of potential for its crappy storyline....\\n",

While he is being cool in many ways, he is still a wimpy embarrassed fellow. When I look at him he kind of reminds me of Ousawa from Rogue Hero, but when you watch the anime you will see the huge difference.\r\nStill, a great watch. This guy is way better than the classic wimpyguys get dominated and love it by loli girls type of ecchi harem. At least here, you can see and feel somewhat of a bravado.\\n\\n\r\nI'd recommend it to anyone interested in this genre.",

            "content": "I really enjoyed the first 8-9 episodes.  After that point it seemed to shift from school harem to end of the world without really a good transition.  It was just that all of a sudden the director noticed that he had 2-3 episodes left and threw everything into it.  If there was a better transition, I would have rated it higher.  It just seemed to become a different story completely.  I didn't mind the Deus ex machina ending.  That doesn't bother me, maybe because I love Doctor Who.  Who knows.  Anyway, without giving away any plot points,I think that either adding another episode or two to give a good transition would have helped in understanding the story.  It's almost like the director assumed that anyone who read the manga knows the lead up, so let's just get it over with.  I think the Harry Potter movies did the sane thing here and there.  Also, it was a bit weird how certain \"friends\" of the Demon King seemed to switch sides multiple times to either help him through or hinder his path.  That seems to be the purview of the \"bad guys\" rather than his friends.",

But with so many ideas and genres to include in a 12 episode anime, It leaves everything half-baked.\r\nThe Story at start came pretty strong, but as the story progresses, The Pacing causes plot holes and unreasonable ideas and reasons for the story's progression that ruins the entire story. \r\nThe Pacing of the Anime ruined the Character development for all of the characters of the story, not only that, the characters, especially the main character's personality changes conveniently for the pacing ofthe story (he was supposed to be the nicest guy but later, broke bones and aggressively beat down thugs later on). Because of the multiple personality that the characters have, their developments seemed half heartedly made just to progress to the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of the anime was all over the place, where characters looked very different between fight scenes. Although the animation of the fights seemed cool, its diffences between it and the normal art makes it look like a new anime altogether.\\n\\n\r\nIn Summary, the story that sets this anime apart from all the other harem ultimately caused it's own demise, with its fast pacing, too much information and dull explanations of important events.\\n",

Although, I have to admit, the story was rushed and made no sense at times (Hoping for another season to clear some things up). The art was pretty good, I loved the effects and the way the characters look. The sound was very good, at least it was for me. The characters all needed more time for their development, which (Sadly) they didn't get much of in this anime. But, I didenjoy the anime and I think that it was a successful anime that should come back with another season! Overall, I had mixed feelings about this anime. I like it sometimes, loved it, then I was confused by it. However, I enjoyed it and I am definitely looking for more! So in the end, I'll have to give this anime either good rating that could be even better if more time is spent on the next season! I would recommend this to anyone who likes; Blue Seed, Kanokon, Omamori Himari, Accel World, or Rosario + Vampire! However since I felt the romance didn't come to a satisfying end and the story was weird I cannot recommend this to anyone who likes; Toradora!, Shuffle!, MM!, Fate/stay night (Along with the others of it's series), AIKa R-16: Virgin Mission, or AIKa: ZERO",

            "content": "despite whatever I say, I still really enjoyed it, but there were some serious problems\r\nfor the quick review - \r\npros:\r\n- fantastic starting concept\r\n- great paced story (FOR 3 EPISODES!!!) *sorry for the rage here, but seriously*\r\n- good introductary plot that draws viewers into the concept\r\n- great main character\r\ncons:\r\n- terribly messy and uncoordinated character and plot development\r\n- horrible pacing the rest of the anime\r\n- seriously, neede more than 12 episodes, cummon\r\n- unneccessary sh*t\r\nmore detail if ur up to it - \r\nFIRST THOUGHTS\r\nwhen I first started watching it, I didn't know what to think, but I immediately liked the idea of it. cool and humble main character(who wasn't a HUGE P*SSY!). magic school is something that isn't really that common, and I liked where it was all going. it was even pretty funny at first.\\n\\n\r\nhowever, this little taste of awsomeness from the first few episodes, was all I was gonna get. I thought that they were gonna elaborate on the whole \"black magic is in the school\", or that they would add some episodes to have our protagonist settly into this new and mysteriously wonderful world he is just introduced to, but...no.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\n(The character development in this anime was so bad, I had to google most of the character's names because there was such poor development, that you coulnd't care who they were)\\n\\n\r\nAKUTO: He wasn't a puss, what can I say, its a harem (kinda) so what can I say, he is amasing othere than his absolutely terrible decision making throughout the anime\\n\r\nMITSUKO: felt like she was going to be an important teacher/advice giving character who was gonna help akuto to master his powers or something. however she was just cutoff right away\\n\r\nKEENA: she was cute, but god damn annoying at times. I satred to accept the idea that she was the main love interest at one point, but then whaaattt???? I guess... not???.....wait maybe?...no (watch the damn anime)\\n\r\nFUJIKO: she was some hot stuff. I honestly though she was goign to be the experienced chick who was gonna have some osrt of relationshit with akuto. like, really, nobody in all of anime history gets so much screen time so early on, and provides so much fanservice just to do ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. yeah that's right, NOTHING! in my honest opinion, it went downhill as soon as her presence faded, I think a lot of people were looking forward to her possible roles. with all the plotting she did, she had a frickin crystal ball and did dark magic and shit, you'd think she would play some sort of roll being one of the hottest chicks there. biggest character letdown I have ever experienced.\\n\r\nKORONE: where to start, I liked the idea, but she got so annoying, I got bored of her instantly. things just got wired and she ended up slowing down the whole anime's progress. literally, two episodes were wasted on her backstory, while they could have trashed that shit for the OVA people to deal with so that they could make room for other character development for the ones who TRULY needed attention. I think that she was necessary to be present, but in no way deserved her own plot seeing how short the anime was\\n\r\nLILY: liked the character, played no part in the \"harem\" duggested by the ending theme and had no character development at all, so it left me with no time to even care about her at all. basically, all that undeserved screentime throguhout the last few episodes was but another...waste\\n\r\nHIROSHI: I liked this guys at first because he brought some joy to the anime table and a couple laughs. but the holy shit, they didn't need to turn him into a sexually confused power ranger. next thing you know, someon outside of the harem had all this plot based around him even though he was built up as a minor character. in my honest opinion, he should not have got any real screentime after the first few episodes, he woulda been less hated if he was just a nobody character\\n\r\nJUNKO: I was open to the idea of her being a love interest to our protagonist. but I pictured her as the butchy type pretty much exactly like that tatsuki chick from bleach. with how wierd she was with her rope (or whatever the hell they were) panties which did not need to be seen. I did not like how favoured she was by the writers, it was actually rediculous, because you really couldn't tell if she was a love interest or nah.\\n\r\nEIKO: she was hot, and since it's a harem, u'd expect our protagonist not to be a man, and add that lady to his list of ladies, but of course, the one time he pussies out, it's in a place where he completely throws away his man-card. she should've at least been able to do something for the plot, once again, being a harem, she looks like that one wierd stalker chick that every few animes have. but she just disappears for a reason that is not even understanable, then comes back like the viewer is supposed to care.\\n\r\nMOTHER F*CKING PETERHAUSEN!!!: this is the biggest badass of the whole anime, I would nothave continued if it weren't for a dragon named f*cking PETERHAUSEN. props to this character.\\n\r\nBOICHIRO: WAIT WHO ARE YOU??? OKAY youl reveal your plans later? no?....wait what I blinked where are you from?...wait future?!?! WTF? where did you come from and why are you in this anime. I really couldn't figure ouyt his business in this anime to begin with, let alone know who he is.\\n\\n\r\nNot one character had the opportunity to have proper development so that the anime can succeed. VERY IMPORTANT TO ALL HAREMS (I don't normally watch them, but this is still a must) : YOU NEED A BOTTOM B*TCH! AKUTO needed to make up his mind so that we could at least have SOMETHING to follow, viewers need a little bit of guidance, we can't do all the work ourselves. I think this anime could have used much more nurturing than it had, 25 episodes MINIMUM, coulda gone for 50 to maximize ALL development or pulled a Death note with 30 something. one of the most important parts of an anime is the memorable feel that you get from watching it that you will always remember the next time you watch it, this anime had none.\\n\\n\r\ndon't get me wrong, it was enjoyable, just not as good as I had hoped. I would have immediately gave this anime a 10/10 if it followed the incredibly srtong start it had with the exact same stuff so that people know what they are watching. I want to be able to tell the difference between an anime, and a bunch of pictures being thrown at my face. \\n\\n\r\neither way, I still recommend watching as you never know, you might still enjoy it. :)",

It's also important to understand that it's not over the top in these 2 categories as well. I was nervous going in but was relieved after the first episode. I had lowered my expectations before seeing this series and was actually pleasantly surprised. That being said, I was able to enjoy what story there was, but I really enjoyed the comedy aspect the most.\r\nThis is not a story driven anime by any means.There is some action, some cool magic, and really I loved the artwork. The music worked, and I was able to watch without feeling like a complete pervert (the panty shots rival Highschool of the Dead). What I found most enjoyable were the colorful characters, though it could have done with a lot more character development. Thankfully, the main character's personality stays consistent, and he's likeable all the way through to the end.\\n\\n\r\nMoving past any snobby remarks about character development and storyline, I would recommend this 12 episode series to those looking for something to fill the time while waiting for your favorite weekly shows to air. Not a bad watch, and it has great repeat value. Not a must see, but not something to necessarily avoid.",

            "content": "Ichiban Ushiro no Daimaou, for future reference it will be called Daimaou, a story about a high school student in a world where the God Suhara, which everyone believes in, is a system created by humans. This system creates a loop of events that occur every 100 years. This includes the continual reincarnation of 2 main characters. The Demon King, and The Law of Identity. But this time, the Demon King is different, can Sai, Akuto, escape the loop of inevitable events created by the one and only god?\r\nWhew, Daimou definitely was a roller coaster ride of events that occurred mainly because of the mainplot line behind the anime. \\n\r\nStory:3\\n\r\nArt:8\\n\r\nSound:9\\n\r\nCharacter:7\\n\r\nEnjoyment:6\\n\r\nOverall:6\\n\r\nNow to explain my reasons for the scores above. Please remember that when writing a review, the MAL ratings are very unbalanced, which indicates that for each category; it can be considered \"decent\" from a score of 4 (+). Whereas below 4, is negative. \\n\\n\r\nThe Story: The story was very captivating and well done, with an introduction to a harem/ecchi/romance anime that I haven't seen yet, Daimaou was going very well. The main plot line of an almighty God, and The Demon King tested by a loop of events was thrilling to me since the animators didn't leave out a nice development of a shounen main character that also does not entirely fall under the two commonly seen harem main character personalities. Those would be, the kind-hearted saviour, or the useless loser that constantly has to be saved. To my surprise I have recently found similar anime with main characters of a harem that I would like to relate to for Sai,Akuto. Sai, Akuto can be filed as a kind-hearted one, yet does not entirely fall under that category because of the implication of a shounen themed anime. This type of main character can also be seen in Campione!,Hataraku Maou-Sama!, and Princess Lover!. As one can see each main character out of these anime that I have listed aren't the standard types in harem, so they manage to stand apart in their own category. This unique aspect I found very enticing, which is why I found the anime to overall be a score of 7-8, however this is only in the beginning. If I could make an analogy of how the story developed, the simplest would be; The take off of a space shuttle, everything goes optimally well, when a sudden engine failure and the shuttle crashes to the ground. Thankfully, 4 of the 6 pilots managed to survive and crawl out of the wreckage. Got that picture in mind? In other words, they took a very well made anime with a good start, and smashed it to tiny little pieces, then managing to tape some of it back together in the end. To quote one of my favorite Youtube reviewers, GRArkada \"The ending is Paramount\". In Daimaou's plot line, this was done quite well. The story managed to pick it self back up after horribly committing anime suicide with a load of cliche, power ranger, korean drama shit. The reason I still managed it to be scored as \"Fair (6)\" overall is because the ending is something one can definitely look forward to. \\n\\n\r\nThe Art and Sound: I've never had to complain about an anime's art or soundtrack before, and I don't plan to start now. The animations for Daimaou were well done, very smooth, I couldn't see any breaks in a picture, the action was very well done. All in all, a good job by the animators. The soundtrack complimented the anime well, adding tense music when needed, and badass music where the main character needed it. Although it didn't strike me entirely as \"I need to download this OST\", it is still worth a mention of supporting the shitty plot line through to the end. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: I'll have to say that the main character reminds me of a recent anime that has just been completed and the theme of both do not fall that far apart from each other. Hataraku Maou-sama! Coincidentally both are Demon Kings xD. The main character has his faults, that coming from the common necessities of a MC from a harem minor themed anime, nonetheless even when the story fell apart, he was IMO the only thing that didn't fall to pieces. The other characters were introduced quite well, although the anime was more plot driven and failed to elaborate enough to satisfaction on the development of each character. The story definitely pushed the anime pace to its limit,which in turn hurt the potential character development deeply. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: To reiterate, the beginning was very well done, and I enjoyed it very much, when the shuttle crashed, I never stopped cursing myself for even clicking on the next episode, when some of the pilots survived, I was mediocrely ( I made that word up) satisfied. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: Those looking for a harem shounen romance drama anime that is mainly plot driven, look no further, but prepare for the ride of ups and downs. It doesn't do too badly in terms of characters, yet one can see the neglected potential. If this anime went maybe for 20 episodes rather than 12 I believe it would have been 5 times better. IMO the score of (6:Fair) is a decent one for Daimaou. \\n\\n\r\n\"I've decided to stop thinking!\" \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading,\\n\r\n-Nebarto",

            "content": "FULL DISCLOSURE: I have not read the manga. **But after I finished watching, I started reading.\r\nSTORY: \r\nIchiban Ushiro no Daimaou is about a guy who transfers to a magical school to become a high priest. His motives are somewhat important and mentioned later in more depth, but essentially he wants to make the world a better place. Along the way he meets and interacts with various girls of different \u2013 yet common \u2013 harem archetypes. \r\nThe universe this anime is set in is quite varied with many magical \u2013 or otherwise \u2013 based powers. Demons, witches, heroes, and a futuristic imperial army are just afew of the many inspirations.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the story is somewhat reactionary and convoluted. There is a lot of concepts being tossed around and I was confused at times, but the real issue is that there is too much material for one season. The story itself is fine, but I must have blinked at some of the wrong moments, as it took me a while to grasp what was going on. The families and various underdescribed factions are the main source of blame.\\n\\n\r\nThe failings of this anime are almost certainly due to the limitations of what can be portrayed well within a 11- to 13-episode season. It would have undoubtedly fared better if more time had been spent on clarifying the positions of the gods, and the structure and intentions of the various factions. \\n\\n\r\nI have to hand it to them though, the mood felt well balanced, with silly and sexy moments almost as often as the crazy fight scenes. \\n\\n\r\nAs expected of a rushed ecchi-harem-shounen, there is some BS strewn throughout, and many characters are lacking in justifications for their feelings, but I don\u2019t weigh that in as heavily for lighter hearted anime.\\n\\n\r\nART+ANIMATION+MUSIC: \\n\r\nAnimation is befitting of an action anime. Battle scenes are very well animated with high frame rates and few static scenes. One episode partway through the season stands out especially for looking like a scene out of a major series. Day to day animation is fine but doesn\u2019t really stand out otherwise.\\n\\n\r\nArt is good but it is not my favorite style. It draws from the pointy arched hair styles of the 2000\u2019s that I\u2019m not really fond of. Plus, what\u2019s with all the crazy hair colors? I know it helps you distinguish characters from each other but ehh\u2026. green and purple\u2026. bleh\u2026 I just can't stand the overly saturated color palette.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some nude scenes, and plenty of panty shots with compromising angles. The ecchi theme isn\u2019t too outrageous though \u2013 most of the girls have average sized chests, which is somewhat fresh. \\n\\n\r\nThe electronic / rock mashup music in-show and in the intro are good. The outro is a cutesy song that is also good.\\n\\n\r\nSound effects are fine.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\r\nThere isn\u2019t much depth beyond the generic character types.\\n\\n\r\nI wish some characters got more showtime. \\n\\n\r\nWith the variety of character styles and powers, I\u2019m getting a One Piece vibe \u2013 witch girl certainly helps with that. That being said, I strongly dislike the school uniforms. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\r\nHeavily enjoyed this show. I recommend watching the uncensored version if not for nips, then at least to avoid having lightly clothed rear-ends patched over. The censoring is not too annoying, but if you have the choice, just go all out.\\n\\n\r\nThe harem interactions aren\u2019t anything really new on their own, but I must be a slut for stuff like this because I enjoyed it enough.\\n\\n\r\nThe battle scenes caught my expectations off guard. Had this show come out with today\u2019s art style (Re:Zero, Shuumatsu no Izetta), it would be in my favorites.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nGreat battle animations, standard harem humor, somewhat convoluted story \u2013 likely thanks to production limitations. If you like most action harems, you should love this.\\n",

            "content": "To begin this review,I will say that this is my second review for an ecchi anime,and I hope it is decently written. I will also note that I am female,not very important here,but I will not be saying anything like \"Too much fanservice!\" Or anything. I completely understand that this is an ecchi anime,and will review it accordingly. Now,on to the review,\r\nStory:7\r\nIt's a decent good story,although it had a lot of potential(but I'm writing about an ecchi anime here! Of course there's going to be wasted potential,but who cares?!). There was a demon king some time ago,he was defeated,things returned to peace,all that stuff happened.Then,our protagonist Sai Akuto comes in! Sai has very powerful magic and wants to be a high priest to change the world and whatnot! At the beginning,he explains this to blue-haired tsundere of the harem on his way to magic-school-thingy! Then,at school,he is told his future job will be as the new demon king. He meets the green haired robot of the harem,and the red haired girl that can turn invisible. The harem is a pretty nice one,and not too stereotypical (except for the tsundere),and I do like the whole idea of magic and all that. But there is a lot of wasted potential,this is an ecchi and harem anime after all,so it's pretty good. \\n\\n\r\nArt:9\\n\r\nI honestly don't pay much attention to the art many anime,but this one had good quality art. Shading and such aside,I believe you know what the \"art\" section actually means in this review...(not really,but still counts for something!)\\n\\n\r\nSound:7\\n\r\nThe opening was good. The sound here wasn't bad,but not really outstanding. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:6\\n\r\nOhh,this is where plenty of ecchi fail. The harem girls were decent enough,most having distinct personalities that weren't just different types of dere's. But that tsundere is pretty bad. Of course,some people like tsunderes,and this one would've been good if she wasn't basically just a tsundere. Nothing more,nothing less. Our protagonist Sai isn't too great of a character himself,but he definitely isn't completely unbearable.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:8\\n\r\nI enjoyed the story and a couple of the characters. The story was pretty interesting and original. Alright,fine. I'll admit,the ecchi has something to do with it as well,but seriously,I watched an ecchi show for a reason damnit,I am going to include it here! \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall:7\\n\r\nIt's good,and worth a watch if you're looking for something to keep you entertained for a bit,although that feeling may fade and you may notice things that could've been done much better,but you'll probably be satisfied if harem and ecchi in a fantasy/school setting are your things!\\n\\n",

The shows comedy falls a bit flat and the plot is very unevenly paced and difficult to get invested in. What carries this show is the very interesting thematic concept behind the plots development, and the sort of interesting main characters.\r\nQuick overview: Main character is foretold to become the new \"Demon King\". Story proceeds like a regular harem show with a broken OP protagonist. Nothing out of the ordinary here.\r\nI have no real comments on the art and sound. You either like it or you don't.\r\nThe characters arefairly basic Harem. The only interesting character is the main character (Akuto Sai) and his idealogy. I honestly really enjoyed watching Akuto's decision making and thought it was well done. \\n\\n\r\nThe show tackles religion in a way that is very unusual and is quiet interesting. Akuto believes that God is a \"system\" and isn't real. However, this belief carries multiple contradictions throughout the show in a way that is both intriguing and relatable. \\n\\n\r\nI would recommend watching the show if you want to think about religion in a more interesting way while watching a show that you don't have to pay attention to at all.",

Expect boobies not plot\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\nDemon King Daimao is an interesting story with alot of potential that falls flat during the 12 episodes. While i didn't really hold much hope for it from the beginning when they introduced the first girl named Hattori. You could see straight away that she would be the Will-they-wont-they-tsundere-love-interest which i don't hate but it has been done so many times. \r\nThe Story \r\nStory resolves around our main character named Sai Akuto, or Acchan as one of the harem girls calls him. He is is an orphan who transfers to aprestigious magic school. First day of he has to take a medical exam in which there is also a magic crow that can tell you what your future job will be. Akuto touches the orb around the crow and thus he is told that he will be a future Demon Lord which scares everybody in the school but that's ok since most of the students don't seem to remember it after few episodes. \\n\\n\r\nI guess the running joke in the series is that Akuto does not want to be a demon lord and tries everything in his power to stop everybody thinking that he would become one. It's fun at start but starts to get boring pretty fast when the humor is supposed to come from constant miss understandings.\\n\\n\r\nCloser to the end we get the more half-assed the plot gets. I think they might have realized that they dont have the funding for second season so they have to force everything in one and thus we get a really rushed ending. I mean the ending resolves around Keena and The blond  whats his face guy. Both of whom are really under developed as characters and should serve no purpose as main plot points since everything we learned about them we learned in the two last episodes. How are we supposed to care what happens to them ?\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nI haven't much to say about the people in this show. They are all nothing more than cardboard cutouts from the \"how to make an ecchi harem anime\"\\n\r\nTheres the big boob, medium boob and tiny boobs for all to enjoy. They also have personalities from the previosly mentioned book. There Tsundere girl, girl who is oblivious to everything, girl who constantly seems cold hearted but is totally into him. \\n\\n\r\nThe best character in the show is Akuto himself as he is the Demon Lord to be but even he can be so annoyingly oblivious to what the girls are doing. I mean i get that thats the whole point of harem animes but good god man get a grip.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nI have to admit that i did fastforward few scenes 'cause i could already see where it was heading but all in all the show delivers what it set out to deliver. Ecchi Harem Anime and boy if it aint all that. Boob shots everywhere and cloths tearing up during every fight. I'm pretty sure the girls were there just so that the monsters could tear up their clothing. \\n\\n\r\nThe fight scenes were cool tho; i wish they had done more with them. The whole idea with magic and such is awesome but they don't play with that idea enough in this.\\n",

            "content": "Ichiban Ushiro no Daimaou or Demon King Daimao in the english translation is, well...bad.  As much as I love harems, I cannot under any circumstances put this as one of the best things ever.\r\nStory: With the story of Sai Akuto, our main protagonist wanting to be a holy man or priest, his life suddenly changes around when a weird raven in a glass container wearing swirly glasses and smoking a cigar tells him that he will be a demon king, something that apparently going to happen as the bird is quite accurate.  (I think the whole bird thing is BS) Then, people beginto freak out at the apparent arrival of the new demon king, and everything goes to crap.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Sai Akuto, our main protagonist is a kind person who throughout the whole series, just wants people to know that he isn't the demon king and the absurd rumors about him are well, absurd.  (Seriously, there's one that says he'll impregnate you just by looking at him.) As for the rest of the cast, well...they're crap.  The female \"harem\" is just really a bunch of cardboard cutouts that don't really change.  Like really, they don't change EVER!  Playing the roles as a kuudere, an overzealous blob of fanservice, an overactive rice eater (my personal favorite), the student council president, and the katana wielding blob of fanservice.  The only other guy that was in this series actually had some credible use in the series, but...he gets toned down in credibility after being given this hilariously bad costume.  \\n\\n\r\nSound and Art: While the art in this anime was fairly good, it was rather ordinary for the most part.  Only in the action scenes was the animation actually very fluid and good.  Other then that, fanservice, fanservice, fanservice.  Repeat that process of art scenes, and you have this.  The sound wasn't really that good to listen to either.  It sounded completely different then what this anime should've had in its soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal enjoyment: Oh god, where do I begin?  First of all, tentacle monsters and nipples shouldn't be included!  (personal complaint).  The pacing in this anime was just...horrible.  From episode 1 everything just failed to come together.  They try explaining what the premise is, but it just doesn't work out.  In the end, something weird happens and...I don't know.  The pacing of this anime is very bad and the explanation of what is happening is even worse.  For the last few episodes, my mind went blank trying to comprehend what the hell I just watched.  Yes, this anime is funny in a sense of the word, but it just really falls short as one of those animes that needed some more time.  Like...seriously.  For anyone who's watched this, can you explain to me?  Did god really exist in that anime or what?  For anyone who wants to take this blob of insanity and manna into consideration, it's best advised to turn your brain off and just watch, cause I can guarantee you, nothing will come together or make sense.",

To be honest, I was kinda bored with the story at the end because of a fact that I was kinda surrounded with nudity at first. O wait, the story? Oh yea. One guy, Sai Akuto aims to become a High Priest in the world of magic or whatever. He suddently finds out about his potential status of Demon Lord and he has some unusual powers as well. As I already pointed out, the nudity meter sometimes really exceeds the limits. There're basically situations where something causes an explosion and girls aretop-less.\\n\\n\r\nI may sound like critizing much. Well, there are also some seriously hillarious scenes led by Korone, the Observer (an artificial intelligence perhaps?) having no limits in self-control of her actions (mostly the seducing ones aimed at main character).\\n\\n\r\nI can recommend this to all ecchi fans, but story was kinda ewww - not really interesting, especially in last 2-4 episodes.",

            "content": "First of all i would like to say that i only managed to get through 7 episodes of Ichiban Ushiro no Daimaou. When the Power Ranger appeared and the oh-so-powerfull Demon Lord turned into a Super Sayan for no apparent reason i couldn't take it anymore and turned it off and decided to write this review in hopes that no one else would make my mistake and watch this. \r\nI went into Ichiban Ushiro no Daimaou expecting to see some light comedy and some nice \"lady parts\" but i got not a lot of the former to be honest and way too much of thelater, which, coupled with a pretty good premise that required none of those, is not  a good thing. As other reviewers have noticed the anime starts off pretty strong but goes downhill after about 5 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nI actually found the premise quite interesting, a boy is destined to be the next Demon Lord and cause mayhem and destruction all over the world. The problem is that he doesn't want to be the next Demon Lord and cause mayhem ... etc. That had a lot of potential as an action anime or a nice philosophical/drama series, but since this is a harem anime instead, we get girls, lots of girls, that take their clothes of or show their underwear for no apparent reason every 5 minutes. And that is where the anime started failing for me, not that i mind a bunch of cute girls wearing nothing, but when that side starts to move in on the actual story and character development, everything becoming just an excuse to give a panty shot, getting a girl naked or throwing another sexual innuendo on the screen and the story, which again, had the potential to be interesting, is forgotten or rammed down our throats with some new villain or organization that just sprouted in the last 5 seconds of screen time and we have no idea who they are what they want is time to turn off or go watch a better series. Which i did, at the seventh episode where, as i said before, there was a Power Ranger, a Super Sayan, an old dude who licked a 10 year old and a giant sea cucumber (i couldn't make this up even if i wanted!). Even the comedy was pretty much forgotten after the first 5 episodes. Everything became so convoluted and weird there was no point in continuing.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was varied. The first episodes were good, nice effects, not annoying or distorted. But the last episode i saw was awful, it went from bad to good, weird effects and distorted characters that didn't even look human to the way it was before then back again. The Demon Lord turned Super Sayan and had huge muscles for one minute then he was skinny then Super Sayan again the skinny again. It is like the animators had two teams that had no idea what the other was doing then merged the two animations together and decided to hope for the best. It made no sense whatsoever.   \\n\\n\r\nThe sound was good, voice acting was adequate. I don't remember any soundtrack songs that stood out, good or bad, but i guess that says something. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of characters i liked the girls, they were cute, funny and didn't really fall into a \"type\", had a background that seemed interesting and even presented some development, even if slight. The one i had a problem was the so-called Demon Lord. I thought he was too wimpy. He had some confidence but he didn't have that \" i will overcome everything\" attitude, nothing that made him stand out from the sea of main characters that had their own shows until now. In a month or two i will not have remembered him at all.\\n\\n\r\nIf you really want to see it, although i don't know why, there are better ecchi/harem/comedy anime series out there, i suggest the first 5 episodes then go look at paint dry, it will seem like better way to waste some time.",

            "content": "More or less directly copied from my review on Anime Planet\r\n-----------------------------\r\nHoo boy... this show... when people said it started well, and went downhill at the end, they weren't kidding.\r\nI watched Ichiban Ushiro no Daimaou at the recommendation of a friend on Steam; he told me that I should watch it, since I seem to enjoy harem anime. He did warn me about the drop in quality, but I never expected it to end like that.\r\nPerhaps it would have been better for me to give this a miss altogether...\r\nStory\r\nThe initial premise isn't actually that bad - Akuto Sai wishes to become something similar to a highpriest, yet is predicted to become the next demon lord, a bringer of destruction. So now he has to do his best to fight his apparent dark destiny.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime was good at the beginning, but its pacing more or less destroyed this anime. The last episodes in particular tried to cram FAR too many things into such a short space of time, and it left far too many things unexplained - episode ten especially so.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\\n\r\nThere really is not a lot for me to say about animation this time around. That or I can't put it into words.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was amazingly average for me. The action scenes were nice to look at, but outside of that, there was nothing that really stood out for me.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs were also nothing really special, with maybe the exception of the different hair colours for each of the heroines. Not one of them shared a colour, which was a little odd at first, but otherwise not important.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nThe background music in Daimaou is one thing I never really noticed. There were some times when it seemed out-of-place, but otherwise there was nothing really noteworthy about it.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening song somewhat fits with the anime's style; the ending, however - being a sweet J-pop song that emphasised the harem aspect of the show - , grew increasingly dissonant to the episode's mood after each one.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors fit the characters rather well in this anime. Takashi Kondo and Shizuka Itou in particular seemed to fit their characters like a glove with Akuto Sai and Fujiko Etou, respectively.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nWhen all else fails, you need to at least have characters to make the show entertaining. However, this may be due to my bad mood when watching the latter half of Daimaou, but I couldn't even really enjoy the characters that much.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Akuto is a good character, what with wanting to help people yet is always seen as the bad guy even if he isn't involved in something, the real star of the show was most definitely Korone. This single character brought so many laughs to the show, going so far as to adopt a \"little-sister\" voice from time to time, which brought even more laughs.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, the other characters leave something to be desired. Junko is a textbook tsundere, while Keena is the energetic airhead and Fujiko is the beloved sempai with a darker side. It certainly doesn't help that Lily Shiraishi, despite being shown in the ending theme, isn't even seen a lot of the time. Which is a shame really, because she was one of the other characters I liked.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal thoughts\\n\\n\r\nI shouldn't have expected much from Daimaou, but with such an interesting start, it was inevitable. Overall, unless you just want some mindless fun with some fanservice on the side, I would avoid Ichiban Ushiro no Daimaou like the bloody plague. Its story - particularly at the back end of the show - is an inconsistent mess, and the characters aren't particularly enjoyable to watch either.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing that really saves this show is the android observer, Korone, and MAYBE the show's opening theme.\\n\\n\r\nTruthfully, this anime needed at least 24 episodes. I wouldn't watch a sequel, but if a reboot were to come about with more episodes to fix the atrocious pacing this anime had, I would gladly watch it.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 2.9\\n\r\nAnimation - 6.1\\n\r\nSound - 6.8\\n\r\nCharacters - 5.4\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 3.0\\n\r\nFINAL SCORE - 4.84",

It is supposed to be good, but i don't like those kinds of anime where a muscular guy in the main character.  What i expected from this anime was some main guy that looked like he stepped out of the anime \"Needless\".  However despite my previous expectations, it was actually quite good. In fact it scored a 8 on my scale \"something i thought was special but i guess not\".  Truth is this is more like a 8.8 or 8.7 on myscale... i would not say it was a masterpiece by any means but they did really good, and i would like to congratulate them for getting me to look past the whole \"muscle guy main character\" thing.  ALTHOUGH  i will down grade them for not keeping a consistent character design in every episode \"he will sometimes go in and out of muscle mode without warning or reason\".    So there you have it my review on Ichibane Ushiro no Daimaou.  Hope it wasn't to uninformative.  I just needed to get that off my chest.",

He befriends a \"reckless\" girl and they make off to the Academy. All of a sudden, the machine that determines your future tell him that he is... You guessed it, a Demon King. Then hilarityensues. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 8\\n\r\nThe art was average, but the character designs made use of that, and the beasts are all well portrayed.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10\\n\r\nI loved the OP and ED music, as they were original and catchy. The in-battle music was epic as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10\\n\r\nSo lets see.

I mean, after the first episode I downloaded the entire series! I recommend this to anyone who likes action, Demons, powerful MC in a harem, epic concept, and if you don't mind a bit of Ecchi. \\n",

            "content": "Ok,ok so yeah I watched this because I knew it was ecchi and knew what to expect. The story takes place somewhere that seems like feudal Japan, present day Japan and future Japan and a magical world that would remind you of negima. The main character Akuto Sai, is going to train at at Constant Magick Academy and wants to be high preist. It never really explains what a grand preist is, it just shows you a vaugue image of something that looks like a pope. The story never exactly explains how christianity could exist in a magic world but alas we don't know ifa grand preist is christian. When they arrive at the academy they are all put before an elcetronic crow to have there destiny's fortold. The series paralles Harry Potter, they take a train ride to a magic school, have their \"Innitiation\", and there is also a \"Forbidden\" forest with magical animals. Some could argue otherwise or pherpahps it was simple coincidence but back to the story. The crow fortells his future as the Demon King that arose 100 years ago and almost destroyed the world. AKuto is then subjected to ridicule and objection, as his is feared. The goverment sends an android girl to protect him. Then as with all Harem anime, multiple girls throw themselves at him for different reasons despite his un-populairty. The anime fits the bill with the homey dunce girl, the tomboy, the big-breasted heiress,the semi-emotionless android and the elite smart girl. Also another small boy attaches onto Akuto and calls \"Big Brother\" despte being the same age as Akuto. The 12 episodes usually cater to the male psyche with panty peeks, jiggly content and kinky situations. Word of the wise, come for bounce, forget the pathetic story. The bulk of the episodes is mainly spent trying to help Akuto figure out his true destiny and the menaing of his prophecy. Til the end the story becomes a confusing mess and it tries to incorporate some type of religious over tones and god turns out to be a computer in a tree, or thats what I could understand of it. The animation is surprisingly good, and don't get me wrong everything was good except the actual story, which was the really annoying part",
