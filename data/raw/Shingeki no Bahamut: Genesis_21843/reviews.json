            "content": "Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis, by all accounts, should have been a completely forgettable and mediocre show having the pretense of being a teaser anime for Cygames and their mobile card game. The source material has the plot of a piece of cardboard and is little more than a collection of conceptual artwork. With all those things in mind, Studio MAPPA rises to the challenge and completely shatters my non-existent expectations as they set the standard for a promotional show.  \r\nTaking place within a fantasy setting where the combined efforts of mankind, gods and demons have successfully sealed away the world-destroying Bahamut, the world ofMistarcia enters into an era of peace. To insure that Bahamut would be forever encaged in its prison, the seal's key was split into two pieces and given to the gods and demons respectively. Two thousand years, a  women named Amira manages to steal the gods' half of the key and that where the show chooses to kick off its epic adventure. Caught up in Amira's quest to reach the land of Helhelm are two bounty hunters with clashing sets of personalities and values. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot is simple enough and easy to follow but Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis's strength lies in its brilliant execution and ever-escalating set pieces. Human, monsters, gods and demons of all different shapes and sizes come in for a battle royale that never fails to disappoint because the action is paced to be fast and furious which leaves little room for exposition. This actually works in the show's favor because it let the viewer's knowledge of other fantasy shows fill in the gaps instead of piling on explanations that would only get in the way. Fights takes place in varying degrees of captivating environments as the show overwhelm the viewers with its extravaganza displays.  It does fall victim to losing momentum towards the middle portion as a dreaded recap episode shows up and the political maneuvering is less interesting than the hordes of monsters and soldiers duking it out with each other. Fortunately enough, it does manage to pick itself up to throws everything and everyone into speculate of the grand finale.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nHaving nothing but character illustrations as their starting point, the production staff MAPPA have crafted some very lovable characters that are all distinct in their attributes and eccentric personalities. It's not all about the action as the main characters are given fleshed out \\n\r\nbackstorys and motivations rather than being  Amria is actually a very strong demonic melee fighter capable of tearing apart much larger monsters with ease but acts very much like a child in spite of her terrifying power and outward appearance. She is quite endearing and the focal point of which the show drives itself. \\n\\n\r\nSmitten by her looks and misguide notions, Kaisar Lidford is one the two bounty hunters accompanying Amria on her quest to reunite with her mother. A former knight that was disgraced, he still retains his code of honor in every fiber of his being and that extends to his fighting style, hair, and upkeep of his promises. He was overly the knight-in-shining-armor to a fault but I did warm up to him as the series went on as his character dynamics complement the other members of main cast.  \\n\\n\r\nThis brings me to my two favorite characters of Favaro Leone and Rita. To start off, Favaro is nothing like your conventional hero as his goal in life is to loudly indulge in life's guilty pleasures of women, money and booze while. As a red-headed bounty hunter, he is selfish, crass and utterly underhanded when it comes to fighting while wielding a revolver crossbow. \\n\\n\r\nHow awesome is that? \\n\\n\r\nEqually fabulous is Rita, who joins up with the main cast a little further down the story. She may look like loli bait but never adheres to the stereotypical template that her appearance suggested. Her character interactions and contributions made the show that much more enjoyable on top of what was already offered. \\n\\n\r\nThere is a myriad of other supporting characters from all the different race who don't really get or need character development but make the most of their limited screentime in just being plain awesome. Some standouts include Jeanne D'Arc of the humans, Bacchus, a god who manages the bounty system and Azazel of the demon faction. \\n\\n\r\nVisuals\\n\\n\r\nAnimated by the Studio MAPPA, the very same team who created Kids on the Slope and Zankyou no Terror, the amount of quality put into this series places it among the best looking shows of the 2014 fall season. Drawing inspiration from Western fantasy aesthetics, the art style is atypical of the standard Japanese anime look and has that classic Dungeons and Dragons vibe to it. The attention to detail to the various locales and props really help immerse the audience into the world of  Rage of Bahamut: Genesis and that not even mentioning the stellar cinematography which lends itself to be more of a Hollywood film than standard anime show. There are small amounts of 3DCGI and for the most part, it looks all right as it doesn't distracts from the pretty 2D visuals.   \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nYoshihiro Ike, who scored the soundtrack to Ergo Proxy and Tiger and Bunny, comes in with a full orchestra and choir to deliver something that didn't really live up to the epic action on the screen. His work, by all means, was well-composed and of high quality but I couldn't help but feel that the music was rather uninspired  and lack the punch to bring the show to the next level. More specifically, it may be due to the lack of variety when it comes to just relying on strings and vocal as I found hard to recall anything memorable. Perhaps, if he had used more instruments in his ensemble, it would be an given the visuals the accompaniment and energy it deserves. In contrast, the opening credits, \"EXiSTENCE\u201d performed by SiM, was one of my favorites of the fall season with it rock music and awkward Engrish. It does what every opening should do and that is to be extremely metal and awesome in priming the viewers for each weekly installment. \\n\\n\r\nGame Adaption\\n\\n\r\nIf Studio MAPPA had the goal of making me try out whatever they were advertising for, \\n\\n\r\nthey succeeded.   \\n\\n\r\nShingeki no Bahamut: Genesis was amazing enough that I simply wanted more and what better way to do so than to download the game it's based off of. However, upon seeing the chunky dated interface, confusing bland gameplay and obvious microtransactions, I promptly deleted it off my machine. I'm grateful that aspects of the trading card game were integrated quite well in the framework of the show of which was the bounty system and I never felt it was overbearing or obnoxious. It was just a small reminder of what the show's roots are and just how vastly difference they are in terms of quality.  \\n\\n\r\nConclusion \\n\\n\r\nComing completely out of the left field, Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis is the surprise hit of the 2014 fall season. I simply cannot give enough praise to Studio MAPPA for their creativity and talent in creating a show that defies all expectations. There were a few small things that held it back from being a masterpiece, but nevertheless it was still one hell of a ride. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 8.5/10\\n",

            "content": "In depth review #2 - Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis\r\nShingeki no Bahamut was exactly what i wanted it to be. An epic battle fantasy anime with good characters and a unique universe that blended everything together. And DRAGONS, beautifully animated hardcore FUCKING DRAGONS! Most shows with dragons in it makes their dragons look like shitty play-doh statues but this show did i right. All you need to do is see the first scene of the show and you'll know what I'm talking about. If there are any gamers reading this, imagine the game Darksiders mixed with the opening cinematic trailer of Final Fantasy XIV and thatis basically Shingeki no Bahamut in a nutshell, epic.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8.25 (Very Good)\\n\r\nThe story revolves around Bahamut, an all-powerful dragon's rebirth into the world. When this dragon was alive, It's cataclysmic rampage nearly ended all life on the planet. This truth forced humans, angels, and demons to form a temporary trues to seal this dragon away forever. From the backlash of the battle, the god Zeus and Satan himself had to sacrifice themselves by sealing their spirits in two pendants to stop him. If the two keys where to merge again, then Bahamut will be reborn and fuck shit up again. The show start off with a girl how steels one of the keys from the angels and begins the process of Bahamut's inevitable resurrection. I personally thought the story was amazing. It wasn't super convoluted and was easy to understand. Yes, its kind of a genetic (seal to big bad dragon before we get rekted) story but the journey, and back-story behind the characters separated this one from the rest. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 9 (Great)\\n\r\nThe animation was so clean i could of ate off of it. Nothing but stunning. The atmosphere and backgrounds are well flushed and polished. Details can be seen in the smallest of the things on the scene that most people wont even be looking at. In addition, things such as particle were shy of perfection. The sparks that flew of off swords as they clash, the radiant illuminations that where emitted from angles and demons eyes and bodies, the smoke and stones that flew threw through the air during a huge battle. All of these entities were beautifully animated. This is what initially got me watching the series in the first place. The production value for the animation was one of the best of 2014; up there with Fate/Stay Night and Nagino no Asukara. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8 (Very Good)\\n\r\nThe sound that played in the background of certain scenes set the tone of the sequence. They did a good job at doing this since some of the less notable scenes in the anime also made me feel a certain way. It wasn't what was going on, on the scene but was the music that complemented them them gave me the intended anticipation, or unease. For the epic fight scenes in the anime, all i could say it that the music was great. The heavy orchestrated tracks made the battle scenes even more epic then they already were. It's apparent that a lot of time and work went into developing this OST and i wanted to listen to the stand alone tracks but i couldn't find them. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7.5 (Good)\\n\r\nI'm happy to say that the creators didn't play a mindless game of (spin the wheel of generic character archetypes) when making theirs. Almost all of the character's personalities and designs felt new. The main characters were at there very peak when they interacted with each other (Favaro x Kaiser) (Favaro x Rita), however as stand alone characters they weren't as memorable as they could have been. The only exception this this would of had been Favaro. Speaking of, the main character Favaro the most unique person of the bunch. His mindset throughout the show generally stays the same but his own resolve and personality makes him like no other. Not only is his personality unique but his design is to. Favora is actually rocking an AFRO MULLET. I'm not joking here, this is a thing now. For the other main characters, Kaiser is the epitome of a knight. We will do anything to keep his vows and restore honor to his families name. Amira is kind of simple minded but has a goal that she want to achieve. It seems that's all she wants to do; that and eat food. All of the other supporting characters is also well developed.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9 (Great)\\n\r\nI really enjoyed watching this anime. I binged through the entire thing in a day and wasn't dissatisfied. The beginning is a tab slow but shit gets real around episode 6 & 7. If you pass this threshold, you wont be disappointed at all. It an anime that truly shocked me and i believe to be one of the better amines of 2014. If you like action animes, then this is a must watch because you will be blow away.\\n\\n\r\nScore: 8.35/10 (Good) - Must Watch\\n\\n",

            "content": "If the word \u2018adventure\u2019 is part of your daily vocabulary, then Shingeki no Bahamut is definitely something to consider watching. Based off a card game franchise, the series takes place in some sort of alternate medieval universe starring a group of young adventurers. The catch though is that the story is clouded by a dark past relating to a source of power threatening to destroy the world. That source (known as the Bahamut) was sealed away some 2000 years ago but has recently been broken and split into two in the form of keys. A cat and mouse-like game ensures now as to find thekey and determine the fate of their universe.\\n\\n\r\nAs intimidating as the title sounds, Shingeki no Bahamut is actually quite a fun show. And despite being based off a card game, there\u2019s actually no Yugioh-style duels or Cardfight Vanguard battles. Instead, what we get is a fantasy adventure involving a trio of characters \u2013 Favaro, Kaisar, and Amira. Later on, another character named Rita joins them as well. But for starters, the show doesn\u2019t start off with the three being together. In fact, it\u2019s quite the opposite as we follow the life of bounty hunter Favaro. His encounter with Amira is like fate after he unconsciously makes a contract with her; and ends up growing a tail as a consequence.  On the other hand, there\u2019s Kaisar with an almost exact opposite personality compared to Favaro. The show also introduces his purpose for becoming a bounty hunter and why he despises Favaro so much. So yeah, taking for granted, the two aren\u2019t exactly the best of friends or at least anyways. Still, the most important character is perhaps Amira. She may seem like a normal girl with a big appetite but her ownership of a certain key could decide the outcome of their world\u2019s future. This show explores a fantasy adventure quite different than what you may be used to. Rather than just going down a narrow-minded road of \u201csaving the world\u201d, we get a journey of old-fashioned and thrilling fun. I don\u2019t mean fun as in the characters goofing around but fun as in spectacular feel which will keep your eyes glued to the screen.\\n\\n\r\nAdventure series can come as mixed bags for its variety at first. However, Shingeki no Bahamut creates a thrill of an adventure by bending with its natural settings. It\u2019s able to keep its momentum every episode by introducing to the audience what it\u2019s trying to do, the actor and actresses of each journey along with its purpose, and most importantly have fun with it wherever it goes. Indeed, the series\u2019 setting is like a big playground with plenty to offer. From heavy guarded fortresses to the natural feelings of the sea, this series crafts fantasy in such a way that you may almost feel as if you are there. Not only that but the series offers plenty of creatures from its bestiary selection that includes dragons, zombies, and giant crabs. A more prominent species includes angels who seems to play a pivotal background role with connections to Amira. Because let\u2019s face it, we barely know anything about the girl so anything to flesh out her character is a plus. Thankfully, the series doesn\u2019t neglect any of our main characters and provides a detailed insight on some of their pasts including Kaisar and Favaro. It\u2019s always nice to feel attached to some of the characters as well and even Amira can be amusing to watch thanks to her lack of common sense.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the fun feeling of the series, the story can be dark when it needs to be. A prime example consists of the struggle between Demons and Angels. After all, the series is all about finding the God\u2019s Key, the important piece of puzzle used to unlock Bahamut. The series makes it clear through both words and scenarios that Bahamut is something like an Apocalypse. Should the source of power be unleashed would be the end of the world. With a good balance of story and character building, the show is able to focus on its plot very creatively. At the same time, I also find it fascinating how in the middle of all this, the show is still able to deal with interpersonal struggles. I\u2019m referring to the conscious thoughts of Favaro and Kaisar when the two are forced into an alliance in order to survive and recuse Amira. The funny part of their adventures is that they usually argue between themselves in the face of danger. Yet somehow, they survive almost each time not by luck or skill but because of how they are able to cooperate even if it\u2019s just momentarily. Because let\u2019s face some facts: Favaro isn\u2019t exactly a hero (he\u2019s more like an anti-hero motivated by self-interests) while Kaisar tries to play the role of an avenger (take a good guess at who he is planning to kill). Of course, Amira also plays a role with her hidden secrets. Rita too plays a supportive role alongside Kaisar. These four characters makes the bulk of the fun in this series and no episode wastes time on their potentials.\\n\\n\r\nThis show feels like a legend, something to remember by not just for the story or characters. And with legends, there are also myths and faces to remember. Perhaps a prominent character to also take notice is Jeanne D'Arc. Staying true with her name and title, she is a warrior with a deadly lance. The show disregards any sort of feminine weakness in this woman but instead portrays her as someone who vows to save the world, a bold statement that could actually hold some truth with what she offers. Against all odds, she fights powerful demons such as Azazel and proves many times that she is capable of handling herself and perhaps even become a legend to remember. Similarly, Bahamut is also considered a legend with its back-story. The key difference is that its legend can be reborn and the show apparently also has a hidden villain; one who assumingly planned to allow Amira to obtain the God\u2019s Key. The show has that notion of mystery to keep viewers at their seat.\\n\\n\r\nWith all the fun going around the show, Shingeki no Bahamut can seem a bit ridiculous at times. Some of this can be the reoccurring jokes that can seem a bit repetitive. Furthermore, there are times on occasion when the balance of the series feels a bit off. Amira can also feel like a character that viewers will find difficulty to feel attached or even taken seriously at times; just look at the scenes when she is drunk or go full on gluttonous at the sight of delicious food. Finally, another drawback perhaps for this show is some episodes tends to be a bit rushed with resolution. One particular important episode has this predictable outcome with more potential but seemingly ends abruptly. Still, these things doesn\u2019t ruin the series\u2019 fun. In fact, you might be seduced into this story so much where those minor bits are seemingly forgotten.\\n\\n\r\nMAAPA isn\u2019t exactly the most well-known studio but they should deserve recognition for this series\u2019 artwork. Not only do characters look uniquely balanced but the setting itself is engrossed with fantastic elements. Speaking of characters though, Favaro has his signature afro-like hair that is hard to not take notice. Meanwhile, there\u2019s the other supernatural entities that strikes fear and curiosity for viewers. Yet, the most impressive feature of the show truly shines during the action scenes. Marvelously crafted with strong coordination, I give high praise to the action scenarios each episode. Not only do they look good but feels real and hard to forget with its high production values. The show strives to build itself around a memorable adventure of full throttle action rather than asinine fan service. Thanks to what it has shown us, it did just that.\\n\\n\r\nWhile not as strong as the artwork, it\u2019s also hard to forget the music of this series. A good example would be both the heavy metal OP song and the emotional ED. OST also makes sense on most parts with intense beats of its coordination. Luckily, all this balances well with the character voice mannerism as well. I give praise to Favaro\u2019s VA for portraying him as a bounty hunter who always opens up paths of adventure thanks to his motivations. On the other hand, Kaisar\u2019s voice can feel monotonous while Arima is down there somewhere in the middle. In retrospect, the soundtrack is above average but nothing too special that will knock you out of the park.\\n\\n\r\nShingeki no Bahamut is an adventure theme series done right. With the way it does its info dumping, characterization, and storytelling, the series also made it like a wild roller-coaster ride. And during that ride, expect a lot of fantasy tropes that are all mixed in to celebrate the franchise. Some bits of the story could be lacking though and takes a bit of patience to get through. However, this definitely feels like an instant classic. Risky yet compelling, action packed as well as being able to articulate a story, the series proves over and over again why it can pull off its stunts. This is a must-see for any fan who wants to take a deep dive into adventure.\\n",

It starts with the fact that it contains more than one mythological belief (Gods, Evil, Dragons, Legendary Heroes...) and further more they are fused in one story, when I read the synopsis, I thought that this is another anime with cliches about gods, humans, and evil fighting and shit, but then I was so glad I watched the first episode cause the characters were so good actually and since the beginning there was major events in the story.\r\nSecond, the plot is good, I mean, combining stories already known andadding them to the main one is something not easy to do, but in this anime it's fluid and easy to understand even if you have no idea who the characters are in their real myth and if you do, well you will be amazed how the combination worked liked a charm.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the sound (Ambiance) is well worked, simple with no overdone effects and clean, and when it come to the soundtrack, well it's the EPICNESS itself... really outstanding you can't get enough from it, very passionate, so powerfully emotional, so far this soundtrack is only second to elfen lied's...\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah for me it's a 9/10 anime, I enjoyed watching it and it's worth the watch.",

            "content": "\"Which way does the wind blow? To tomorrow!\"\r\nShingeki no Bahamut is a pre-apocalyptic show about fate, destiny and what it means to change your fate, thrown into a cast of very unique characters and a power struggle between angels, humans and demons. The show is very promising from the beginning, builds up a lot of excitement in the middle, but ultimately ends in a rather anti-climactic fashion with insufficient resolution.\r\nTL;DR\r\nStory: 5/10\r\nArt: 7/10\r\nSound: 5/10\r\nCharacter: 7/10\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\r\nOverall: 6/10\r\nGood points:\r\n+ Very unique character and setting designs\r\n+ Good and varied main and supporting cast\r\n+ Exciting and interesting from the beginning\r\n+ Good plot twist towards the end, though it maybe obvious\\n\r\n+ Some good comic moments\\n\\n\r\nBad points:\\n\r\n- Very underdeveloped antagonist characters\\n\r\n- Fails to have a good resolution\\n\r\n- Anti-climactic climax at the end of the anime\\n\r\n- Many plot holes left unexplained\\n\r\n- Lack of development in supporting characters\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nI'm going to tackle this plot analysis in a slightly different manner and instead of focusing on key plot arcs, I'm going to structure this on the various plot merits. The story itself is rather simple. Two bounty hunters and childhood friends, Favaro an Kaisar are at odds with each other. By chance or fate, Favaro meets Amira, a half-demon half-angel, who has just stolen the God Key and received instructions to go to Helheim. Favaro then promises to help Amira to bring her to Helheim but himself doesn't know a thing about where Helheim is or whether it actually exists.\\n\\n\r\n1. Ingenuity / Interest\\n\\n\r\nThe story starts off with the main conflict right from the beginning. Constantly, we are being reminded that everything that the protagonists are trying to do, is to stop Bahamut's impending revival after the God Key was stolen. This same old story of imminent doom is repeated over and over again, as if the audience was too forgetful to remember how deadly Bahamut actually is. (+1 for overarching conflict)\\n\\n\r\nBahamut was in fact, so deadly, that most of the cities managed to rebuild themselves sufficiently within the next 6 months, which is much shorter than it took Haiti to recover from the 2010 earthquake, and Sri Lanka to recover from the 2004 Boxing Day Tsunami. Clearly, Bahamut does less damage in 15 minutes than natural disasters can do in mere seconds. So, not that big of a deal actually.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime did do a good job of attempting to fool the audience into thinking that Bahamut was very powerful though. There were numerous scenes throughout the anime, and in almost every episode, of the angels in heaven creating a barrier made up of tessellated hexagons, struggling to keep Bahamut's pre-awakening power in check. The angels constantly make remarks like, \"We can't keep this up... at this rate, we won't last...\" Archangel Michael even once says, \"If this is the power of Bahamut before he awakens, then how much more when he actually does?\"\\n\\n\r\nThe old \"the world is coming to an end\" overarching conflict is not an original one unfortunately, so the story gets no points for that. Also, as far as plot is concerned, I was never really very excited about seeing Bahamut in action, neither was I very concerned about whether or not he would revive in the first place - because by half of the anime and due to all the constant reminders of Bahamut's terrifying power, it was obvious that he was going to revive anyway, and then get beaten by a random hero anyway.\\n\\n\r\n2. Depth / Development\\n\\n\r\nIn this case, the story didn't offer much depth behind it at all. While Favaro's random musings about what his father said was interesting, all his talk about fate and changing your fate just sounded very cliched and fell on deaf ears. There was nothing remotely thematic about the rest of the story.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the story was so simple that they really stuck to the classic protagonist and antagonist stereotype. The main antagonist, Martinet, the ultimate manipulator's, real motives were basically to watch the world get destroyed, which is a very shallow explanation of his evil schemes. The protagonists on the other hand, simply want to do the opposite - prevent the world from getting destroyed, and nothing much else. It lacked a lot of complexity and depth in this area.\\n\\n\r\nThe only plot development came in the form of the forced suspense at finding out who the real mastermind behind Amira's stealing of the God Key was. And I say forced because they basically used the same old \"masked figure\" who goes about doing obviously evil stuff in Anatae but they intentionally don't show us his face just because they want to keep us asking who it is. But this is repeated so many times that we're no longer interested to find out, or, the more perceptive would already know that this was Lavalley. So again, very limited plot development beyond the main plot line. (+1 for a little development)\\n\\n\r\nThere was one good plot twist though, that Martinet was actually Lavalley, even if it was already hinted much earlier in the Anatae arc, when Lavalley first secretly meets Amira out of sight of everyone else, suggesting that Lavalley was actually a bad guy in disguise. Also, the anime tried not to make it too obvious, by making Lavalley fabricate a fake back story for Amira, as well as making him look like he was trying to stop Jeanne D' Arc's burning at the stake. (+1 for plot twist)\\n\\n\r\n3. Coherence / Logical Sense\\n\\n\r\nThere are a whole host of plot holes in this story, but at least the main assumptions of the story are believable - that there are 2 parts of a key that awakens Bahamut when they fuse together, and that it is prophesied that a hero would be able to stop Bahamut, that there exists angels, demons and humans and that Amira could be born of both demon and angel (+1 for believable assumptions)\\n\\n\r\nThe way the plot progressed also at least made some sense, and there were no super obvious flaws in the way the main conflict was presented and dealt with. Plot lines also progressed smoothly without any major anomalies. (+1 for making some sense)\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, there were many instances where Kaisar reacted very unbelievably and unnaturally, even given his characterization as a narrow-minded person who is greatly affected by everyone around him. From things like crying for Rita, to being over-protective of Amira, to trying to kill Favaro numerous times without even bothering to clarify what happened, to suddenly become super cooperative with Favaro.\\n\\n\r\nBonus Points: Not awarded due to 9 plot holes.\\n\\n\r\nIn episode 1, Favaro and Kaisar are pictured on horseback, jumping off a bridge and falling 15 times their own height through the air (roughly 27 metres) before the horses landed on uneven roof tile surfaces. There is no possible way that this stunt could be performed without inflicting some serious injury on both the horses and the rider, and it is definite that the horses wouldn't be able to continue galloping on top of houses either.\\n\\n\r\nIn episode 3, Kaisar cries over Rita's zombified body when she turns into a zombie after being bitten by one of her own undead units, but Kaisar literally just met Rita in this episode, and it's quite far a stretch to say that Kaisar has any feelings for the young girl at this point in time. All he really did was tell Rita about his backstory and have Rita tell him how pathetic the story sounded.\\n\\n\r\nIn episode 4, Kaisar has only just met Amira, but suddenly wants to \"protect\" and \"save\" her for no real apparent reason, other than the fact that she is a girl. Kaisar seems to have this weird inclination to protect any girl that he meets, doesn't he? Or maybe that's part of his characterization as a noble knight, but it still doesn't make sense whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nIn episode 5, Azazel claims that the New Orleans' Knights were lying in ambush for his demon ship in Sword Valley, but in the show it clearly shows most of the knights on horseback, holding their flag and emblem high in plain sight - it was clearly a direct confrontation rather than an ambush. It's not possible that Azazel's scouts only managed to catch sight of the entire army after they were attacked, since most of Sword Valley's terrain is flat and there is no terrain cover whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nIn episode 6, the three archangels, Michael, Raphael and Uriel, decide that letting the humans take care of Amira, who is currently also sought after by the demons, is a lot better than personally sending angels down to guard Amira themselves. I don't believe the angels lacked manpower since in the last episode, they clearly still had tons of reinforcements and sparing a few to look after Amira would have been a much better idea.\\n\\n\r\nIn episode 11, archangel Michael somehow realizes that the small little unnoticeable purple ball that Rita threw at Jeanne, which bounced off a flying duck, was the antidote for Jeanne's demon transformation, and decides to give up his own life to turn Jeanne back to normal. There is no way, that Michael would be noticing a small ball in an aerial combat situation between Jeanne and Bacchus, also there is absolutely no way Michael can deduce even remotely that this ball is an antidote that works on Jeanne.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 12, Favaro decides that cutting Kaisar's forearm off to fool Martinet into thinking that he was still under his control, and then using the bounty hunter tool on Kaisar's arm to capture Martinet, was a better option than having Kaisar simply use the tool himself. All Kaisar needed was just for Favaro to block Martinet's view of Kaisar for long enough for him to suddenly shoot out the wristband in Martinet's direction and say the commands. It was unnecessary drama and in Rita's words, \"Letting your arm get chopped off, that's stupid.\"\\n\\n\r\nAlso, if all Favaro did was to stab a Barb of Bahamut onto Bahamut's head, then honestly couldn't any random flying angel or demon do it? All they had to do was pass Favaro's barb to any flying ally and it was a done deal. From the angels' point of view, it seems like it was a lot more difficult trying to defend against an awakening Bahamut than an already awakened one.\\n\\n\r\nPlus, if we look back at Martinet's plan closely, we can see a key plot hole resurface at the start of the anime. If Martinet's plan was really to get Amira to steal the God Key and then have her bring it to Helheim, why did he simply leave Amira wandering around herself, trying to find a way to get to Helheim? Shouldn't Martinet have at least given Amira the other half of the pendant so that she could find her way, from the beginning, rather than have some random, unreliable bounty hunter clumsily try to help her find the way there? Martinet made pretty much no effort on his own to positively ensure that Amira would end up and find herself in Helheim, he just basically somehow believed that Favaro would magically lead her there.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the plot suffers in every department - it lacks a whole lot of depth, it isn't particularly interesting or exciting, it's poorly developed and it also suffers from a great host of plot holes. Unfortunately for this 13-episode anime, they couldn't really pull off the plot well enough.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nOP Sequence: 2/2\\n\r\nED Sequence: 0/2\\n\r\nAnimation: 2/3\\n\r\nAesthetics: 3/3\\n\\n\r\nThe OP Sequence was very well crafted and was beautiful, but I really didn't like the artistic style for the ED Sequence. On the aesthetics side, I loved the character and setting designs that this anime used - really quite unique styles - from Favaro's afro to Kaisar's weird hairstyle to Bacchus and his drunk look and Rita, the kawaii zombie girl, was really a joy to watch. The animation side suffers just slightly a little because I thought Bahamut himself was quite poorly animated and made him a lot less threatening than it could have been. He continued to seem frozen in stone because Bahamut never moved anywhere away from his original location.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nOP Sequence: 1/2\\n\r\nED Sequence: 0/2\\n\r\nBackground Music: 4/4\\n\r\nAdditional Themes: 0/2\\n\\n\r\nThe OP Sequence sounds good at first, but after awhile gets really jarring and I kept skipping it after that. The ED Sequence was basically as boring as the animation they put for it. Background music was good though, with a good mix of both eerie and action-packed music. I also liked how they used a lot of vocal orchestra in this - keeping to the Bahamut's \"ancient\" theme. No points for additional themes though, because there were none.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters are Favaro, Kaisar, Amira and Rita in that order for the protagonists, and Martinet and Beelzebub in that order for the antagonists. The rest of the cast - Bacchus, Hamsa, Jeanne, Azazel, Michael are supporting characters.\\n\\n\r\nFavaro definitely is one of the most unique characters I have ever come across. More than just having a weird afro, his constant switching between serious to playful, his style of not wanting to do more than he should, yet knowing that he will regret it, and his general ability to joke around even in the most direst of situations really make you want to love him. You can tell he also changes slightly - from going to simply being happy go lucky to actually taking responsibility for his actions and for Amira, whom he learns to really take care of, like a younger sister (+1 to uniqueness, +1 to growth) His backstory though is kind of insufficient, since we really don't know what exactly happened when his dad and the bandits attacked Kaisar's dad.\\n\\n\r\nKaisar as a character actually falls short of almost anything. He's a cliched noble knight who fails at doing everything precisely because he keeps trying to uphold these noble values without being able think straight and to make reasonable judgements about the situation. He's also fairly useless in the entire anime - his only use being to save Favaro from the demon-state of mind at the end - because besides that he does nothing but get in Favaro's way and is a complete burden to Rita, who can do much better without him. Even while protecting Amira he gets caught together with her and gets locked up in a cage where he could do nothing. Still, at the end he finally learns to put aside his differences with Favaro and managed to, as a team, defeat Martinet in an overly dramatic manner (+1 for growth). His backstory was as insufficient as Favaro's, since they basically share the same backstory, but at least his \"childhood friend\" link to Favaro shed more light into his interactions with Favaro and explains how he both wants and doesn't want to kill him (+1 for character interactions).\\n\\n\r\nAmira is also a rather interesting character, with superhuman powers of transforming into a one-winged demon and basically just brutally punching her enemies down. She's also later on revealed to be young, in fact, so young that she technically qualifies as a little kid in spite of her looks. The plot tell us that demons made her age faster using the cocoon, so that her body develops faster and is several years older than her mind. That's not a bad explanation, but it basically robs Amira of any characterization whatsoever. She becomes a complete and total pawn in this anime, used by Martinet, used by Favaro, used by everyone else essentially, and has hardly any views, opinions of her own, and merely gets told what to do. While she does have an awesome transformation ability, the fact that the anime only made her out to be childish really diminished her role in the plot.\\n\\n\r\nRita is by far my favourite character in this anime, and also one of the characters that was better developed than the rest. Rita is a young girl who turns a necromancer after discovering a book, and then uses her powers of reanimating the dead to \"play village\". Apparently she's played village for at least 15 years already and is basically getting sick of it. She eventually runs into Kaisar and Favaro and after failing to kill them, turns into a zombie and starts following Kaisar around. Her visibly nonchalant-looking character and blunt remarks are well-weaved into her \"more mature than she looks\" archetype. If Amira is the girl who looks older than her age, then Rita is the opposite, a girl who looks much younger than her age, but of course, a more mature character is a lot better for main character types. Rita manages to not only become useful in every situation using a reanimation ability - saving them from soldiers, putting up distractions - but also manages to uncover Martinet's concoction and, as a somewhat professional herbalist, manages to create an antidote that counters it. What's not to love about this adorable little child whose only goal is to save her friends? Even though she's acts rather coldly and cruelly to Kaisar, she shows that she really does care for him, even helping to bandage up the stump of an arm he has left at the end. (+1 for cute amazing character, +1 for multi-faceted nature)\\n\\n\r\nAs for the rest of the supporting cast, they were also a host of very interestingly conceptualized characters. Bacchus, the self-proclaimed god, who basically only drinks a lot and pays bounty hunters whenever they get a bounty, and his amazing duck Hamsa who is more than just a little pet, but proves to be able to fly and deflect projectiles by expanding his body. There's also Jeanne D'Arc, who is awesome sword fighter capable of wielding a huge-ass sword that can unleash such a devastating blast that it forces Azazel to retreat. Jeanne also sees some character development in the form of her righteous, unwavering nature when she was tempted to take the concoction. Unfortunately, once she turns evil in the later episodes, even after Michael's sacrifice to restore her normalcy, she ceases any further usefulness in the plot whatsoever. (+1 for interesting, varied cast) And of course, there's Azazel, who did nothing but get ambushed and took his revenge on Beelzebub. He's not very developed either.\\n\\n\r\nOn the antagonist's side, we have the one-dimensional Beelzebub who is so stupid that he doesn't even know that he can't control Bahamut even if he bestows upon it the Transcendent Key that he made. Beelzebub basically is a power-hungry monster but ends up getting, and deservedly, brutally incinerated by one of Bahamut's blasts. He's so poorly developed that I can't even consider him a character.\\n\\n\r\nMartinet is just slightly more interesting because he's the one doing all the ground work, making sure his evil schemes fall into place, manipulating an angel from long ago, the demon working with him, and various other humans including Jeanne, Favaro, Anatae's King to make his plans go smoothly. But still, not a word is said about his character or backstory, and his motives for plotting all this evil is even worse - \"I just want to watch the world get destroyed.\" Way to go, another crazy apocalyptic lunatic.\\n\\n\r\nFor characters, the anime suffers quite a bit from poor character depth and development for a lot of the cast, including main characters, and the antagonists are just so poorly developed that they were basically ignored this entire time. Still, the uniqueness of many of the characters really pulled through and made me enjoy watching the characters interact with one another.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nFor humour, the anime has done quite well. There is a lot of slapstick on the part of Favaro and Kaisar, who get into trouble plenty of times and have to have their fellow allies save them. Bacchus and Hamsa are also a pretty comic duo, because both have very peculiar sneezes. Also, Rita's monotonous and blunt remarks at all the stupid situations just make me laugh a lot more. (+2 for comedy)\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of action, the anime also doesn't fail to deliver. While there isn't a lot of actual action and fighting scenes per se, there was a decent amount of close combat fighting, sword fighting, all of which were rather well animated and was exciting enough to keep me watching. (+1 for action)\\n\\n\r\nThere were also some hints of emotion in the anime, especially at the part where Amira finally gets to meet her own mother, but in very dire circumstances. Still, she presses on stubbornly to give her a hug, and at the end says that Favaro was right that her mom would recognize her just from the hugging alone. Her kiss with Favaro was slightly unnerving though but at least it gave their relationship a good finishing touch. (+1 for emotion)\\n\\n\r\nPacing-wise, the anime was pretty exciting from the beginning, and really set the mood of being an action-comedy flick, as well as introduced our two very interesting important characters of the show. (+1 for pacing) Towards the middle though, as the story slowly progressed and we slowly started to see who was the evil mastermind behind the entire evil plot, things got a lot less interesting as things became obvious and I honestly just wanted to skip to the part where Bahamut awakens. And finally, at the end when he finally does, the resolution was just super anti-climactic, I never even go to know what happened to Rita or the other supporting characters, I only ever saw Favaro and Kaisar.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has at least earned itself 1 bonus point for not having any filler episodes (not counting the recap episode 6.5, even though it's useless).\\n\\n\r\nWhile I did enjoy most of this anime, there were honestly some parts where it did feel repetitive and got a bit too boring for my liking.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nAltogether, I thought that the plot could have seriously had more thought put into it, while the characters Kaisar and Amira really need a lot more character development as part of the main character cast. It was a fairly enjoyable watch, though I was admittedly disappointed after reading some really rave reviews about this show.",

            "content": "Shingeki no Bahamut is a series that I don't seem to love as much as others, which I will explain in detail while trying not to spoil too much.\r\nFirst of all, the music and art is great, presenting the show in a spectacular package. Even the occasional CGI monsters works for the most part, sticking out yet without looking lazy.\r\nI was drawn in by the idea of bounty-hunting and the refreshing design of our swashbuckling main character, Favaro, who brings in just the right balance of charm and goofiness. The conflicting relationships he shares with everyone around him is also an unending spring of entertainment.\\n\\n\r\nThe first episodes present an interesting concept. After bragging at a bar, Favaro unwittingly tricks a demon-girl and gets into a contract with her. Our suave rogue is now stuck with a demon far stronger than himself, who could easily destroy him with the flick of a finger if she realized he lied to her. It had great potential for some mind-games, with Favaro constantly having to lie and outsmart the demon in order to survive.\\n\\n\r\nSadly this is where the characters start to show how underdeveloped they are. The demon-girl turns out to be a na\u00efve girl, easily outsmarted by everyone, turning into a plot-device and a damsel in distress. The promise of a great character-dynamic between her and Favaro goes straight out the window. My biggest pet-peeve however is that Favaro suffers from an old shounen-trait, which is that he\u2019s too cool to care about anything. Is Favaro cool? Sure. Does having no clear motivation make him cooler? Not really. If anything it just makes him look like a third wheel when he's dragged into situations against his will. He even states out loud that he doesn't know exactly why he's doing what he's doing. He says he wants to rebel against destiny and forge his own path, yet his motto is \u201cthe wind blows to tomorrow\u201d, symbolizing just how much he's guided by wherever the wind blows him. In a nut-shell this is what made the characters a let-down for me.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is a mish-mash of ideas that I\u2019ve already seen done better. The great personification of evil that\u2019s about to be awakened after a thousand years. The bickering trio from Samurai Champloo. The literal retelling of Jeanne d\u2019Arc\u2019s legend with the added twist at the end.\\n\\n\r\nThe story has several problems, but one is far bigger than the others. Our title-character Bahamut is not even remotely involved with the main characters until the last third of the series. The angels, demons and Jean d\u2019Arc however are involved with Bahamut early on. I felt like the actual main characters were left to aimlessly wander while the main plot developed in the background.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it is a well-animated series with an underdeveloped story that never delivers on what could have been something far greater.",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**\r\nEvery now and then, an anime comes along that is so remarkably charming, entertaining, and fun that you just completely forget about the rest of its flaws. Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis, is the epitome of this kind of anime. It\u2019s 100% \u201crule of cool\u201d; a million things are going on at the same time, ridiculous amounts of insanity are crammed into short intervals of time, the characters and plot events are totally over the top, and yet all you can do is smile while watching it. SnB is undoubtedly the pleasant surprise of the season, considering that it\u2019s based on, of all things,the lore of a card game. First WIXOSS and now SnB\u2026 Huh. Maybe card games are on to something. Anyway, let\u2019s get to the review:\\n\\n\r\nSynopsis: This story follows the happenings throughout the world of Mistarcia: a magical clusterfuck where humans, gods, demons, monsters, creatures, etc all must coexist. Long ago, a tremendously powerful being, Bahamut, threatened to destroy the land, but humans, gods, and demons united to seal its power away. The key to that seal was split into two pieces; one half was given to the gods and the other to demons, so that they would never be united and Bahamut would never be released. Two thousand years later, Bahamut threatens to be awakened once more\u2026\\n\\n\r\nIf you think about it, there\u2019s really nothing remarkable about SnB\u2019s premise; I think we\u2019ve all seen the \u201can evil power sealed away for thousands of years is going to be awakened!\u201d type of thing before. What makes this show so awesome is not in its premise, but in its execution. The show thrives during its stretches where there is very little exposition at all, which is most of the time. SnB knows how to \u201cshow don\u2019t tell\u201d, and let's the plot events do the talking for them. Unfortunately, the show gets away from that winning formula during its middle stretch and begins spending way too much time on the overarching story, which creates a number of problems. As previously mentioned, the plot of this show is really nothing special; it's way too ambitious for its own good, has holes, and isn't exactly the most original. When the awesome, over-the-top action slows down, the audience begins to remember that these flaws do indeed exist, hurting the enjoyment gotten out of the anime. Luckily, it pulls itself out of its overly-plot-focussed rut relatively quickly and goes back to the fresh and energetic action you can't help but love. I really can't stress enough how nearly every episode presents us with an entirely new scenario in a totally new setting full of insanity and pure fun. For instance, have you ever wanted to see a fight consisting of zombies vs. bounty hunters vs. mermonsters vs. demons vs. a giant crab on board a pirate ship? If you aren\u2019t at least slightly amused by that idea, then you\u2019re a stick in the mud. It\u2019s HARD to not be entertained by the show\u2019s extremely well done action, comedy, and variety of settings. There may not be much depth to the plot, but this anime will make you not care.\\n\\n\r\nAs amusing as the plot may be, the real factor that makes it SnB so endearing definitely has to be the characters. They are a delight to watch every second they are on screen, ensuring that there is never a boring moment. Surprisingly, this cast doesn\u2019t just manage to be mindlessly entertaining because of their personality quirks; they are legitimately well written. Favaro, the closest thing we have to a protagonist, is hilarious, charming, has clearly defined motivations and even has a small semblance of a backstory. Amira, the female lead, is quite similar; she\u2019s charming, she\u2019s funny, she has a backstory, but she is also strong; no misogynistic stereotypes to be found here. Kaiser and Rita are marvelous additions as well, not to mention the plethora of colorful side characters. Some of the cast may be underdeveloped, but they certainly never cease to be entertaining. It has been a long, LONG time since I\u2019ve seen a cast of characters with this much personality. They make the show an absolute blast to watch and you\u2019ll definitely get attached to them.\\n\\n\r\nTo top off the intoxicating style of SnB, it\u2019s worth mentioning that the animation looks completely awesome. For one, this is actually a rare example of CGI done RIGHT in an anime; it\u2019s used sparingly and actually looks fluent when it is used. Besides that, the art style, shot composition, character/monster designs, and animation is all spot on; it makes for an immersive experience that you can\u2019t take your eyes off of. That brings us to the music, which is just as fun and over the top as the rest of the show. The OP gives you a pretty good idea of what you\u2019re getting into and the OST never fails to set the \u201cFuck yeah!\u201d kind of mood that the show is so good at eliciting. SnB wouldn\u2019t be the same without it\u2019s stellar and stylized presentation.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, this anime is likely the most pleasant surprise of the entire year. It ranks right up there with the other best \"rule of cool\" shows as an awesomely entertaining, funny, action packed adventure with endearing characters and a kick-ass presentation. It doesn\u2019t have a whole lot of depth to it and it\u2019s not exactly going to blow you away, but it\u2019s hard to argue against the fact that this anime is fun as hell to watch. If this kind of show is your thing, I recommend it!",

Maybe it was a bit too short, maybe they just rushed it a bit...maybe making 25 episodes would made the anime better, but only maybe, who knows.\r\nI can only tell that i really enjoyed watching it because it was a bit....well, yeah, different :D\r\nCharacters: 7/10\r\nOh god, there are characters i really hated at the start,and characters i really liked at the start...but then, and i never actually knew this could happen...it was the complete opposite. The characters i liked became really annoying while the ones i didn't really like became really cool after realizing some things. That was a nice experience, i can't deny it.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animations in the anime are really awesome, the first episode had such great animations i couldn't really believe it and it lasted till the last episode. The surroundings and the characters, the movement, everything was fitting greatly.\\n\r\nReally nice and fresh colors, i can't really complain much :D\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAt the start i didn't really like the Opening theme, but after listening to it a few times, it was stuck in my head for a few days, it was just like the second Death Note Opening, first it was disturbing then i loved it.\\n\r\nThe ending was really nice and calm, actually beautiful.\\n\r\nThe background music wasn't bad at all, it was fitting with the moments and the anime itself.

            "content": "Another anime that prove MAPPA\u2019s technical capability, after the success of Zankyou no Terror. We received another amazing anime. So let\u2019s start.\r\nBahamut starts with the most enthralling beginning that makes us all excited. We get the usual adventure-slash-fantasy vibe executed in the best way possible. But the problem is, as we get closer to the midway of the show, the mood of the show toned down. I now realized that Bahamut is becoming more boring and dull. It is losing its charm. It becomes less entertaining. For the reason, that Bahamut is not even \u201ctrying\u201d. It is not that ambitious of a work to becomemore entertaining. That is why in the end, it almost became a generic fantasy adventure anime. \\n\\n\r\nBahamut has a cast of a usual fantasy anime but the good thing here was that their characters are well written. We have the awesome Favaro, a goofy bounty hunter with an afro and Kaisar, the gallant bounty hunter/knight. Let\u2019s not forget the childish Amira and her seemingly counterpart which is the grumpy (and badass) Rita. These character might be bound to some overused character tropes but, like I said, that doesn\u2019t matter. They did the role they were supposed to do and that is good.\\n\\n\r\nConsidering MAPPA is from Madhouse, it is not surprising that the animation is beautiful. But it is not only that, Bahamut\u2019s charm is its camera use. The camera is comparable to those of Hollywood fantasy blockbusters. It is like Pirates of the Caribbean in a way! The movement is full of fluidity with well-choreographed fights. The sound is not that bad either, the OP and ED are amazing and the VAs did a OMEGA GOOD JOB!\\n\\n\r\nBahamut, although I said that it was going downhill in the second half, is far from disappointment. It is good in its own ways but really needs to work on the narrative. Anyways, this show is solid, fun, and enjoyable. 7/10",

            "content": "Rage of Bahamut started off feeling like it would be this really epic but lighthearted swashbuckling adventure in a pretty cool fantasy world...but then from about half way through, it tries (and fails imo) to be serious. It loses a bit of its cool, its charm, and fun. \r\nThe main character Favaro is essentially a younger, more energetic version of Jack Sparrow- except he's a bounty hunter, not a pirate. He's cool, witty, pretty skilled in combat, and especially good at escaping just about any bad situation. But the rest of the characters are okay at best- Amira's fluffy, childish personality could be quite charming,but the animation doesn't really fit that personality. Kaisar is a bit boring. And Rita, the zombie-raising witch, is pretty cool-kind of (slightly) reminds me of Toph from Avatar, but imo she doesn't get enough time to be as cool as she could be.\\n\\n\r\nBut the problem is that the characters and the setting and the music, and especially the first few episodes, make it feel like this is going to be an adventure. Amira's goal is to get to Helheim, and she hopes that Favaro will take her there, since she's convinced that he knows how to get there (and of course, he doesn't). That gave the impression, at least to me, like they would be going to different towns on a quest to get to Helheim, with Favaro getting into and out of trouble everywhere they go, with Kaisar following them and trying to catch Favaro.\\n\\n\r\nBut then demons and dragons and a war from long ago comes up and it turns into a generic action adventure where the 'chosen hero', Favaro has to save the world...and tbh, I would have rather not had that. Of course, it's more fun and charming than most animes with this type of story- mostly due to Favaro himself, as well as the music and setting that give it a more adventurous tone. But I don't like the direction it went, especially since they end up staying in one city for the slower second half. But if I had to give some credit to the second half....(spoiler alert for the very bottom of this review)\\n\\n\r\nBut I must say, the show does leave on a note that gives me hope that if they ever make a second season, that we might actually get that adventure that I craved in the first half.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nAGAIN, SPOILERS AHEAD!!! \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nNormally in a show,movie, etc.  like this, they'll make Amira turn evil, and then everyone keeps telling the main hero that there's nothing he can do but to kill her, but at the last moment the hero manages to save everyone AND keep her alive. While I do sometimes like that not everyone has to die, there are few shows that I've seen that can do it in a way that doesn't feel too forced, out of the blue, and same-old same-old. \\n\\n\r\nBut in Bahamut, Favaro actually does sacrifice Amira (or at least it seems that way) to save the world. I must say I'm impressed by the fact that it broke that cliche. It actually was a pretty sad scene.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Here are the three things that made this anime so wonderful:\r\n1) It created the sense that the world was expansive and filled with mystery and potential adventure, which is something that many other anime have tried to do and failed miserably at.\r\n2) The characters (for the most part) weren't cutouts of what is so easy to find in anime.  The main character, Favaro, was intelligent and adroit, but he wasn't without his faults.  He wasn't just some guy that was fighting for peace for no other reason than peace.  He has more depth than that, he can be selfish and cold, aswell as kindhearted.  Another main character, Kaisar, is constantly trying to get back at Favaro for stripping his family of their social status.  Although he does fit into the role of the always chivalrous character, he at least has a nice dynamic with Favaro.  Amira, the female lead, was well fleshed out.  She has a very childish personality, and it shows at every possible opportunity.  This is a very good personality for her, and it is explained why later in the series (I don't want to have any spoilers, so I won't say why).\\n\\n\r\nand 3) The animation.  It is really well done for the most part.  The character all have their own unique designs (no need to have to differentiate characters only by their hair color like in SOME anime).  The animation is fluid and the chaos and fighting in the show is where the animation really stand out in fluidity and overall beauty.  The only problems that I found with the animation was the monster, Bahamut.  Although he seemed epic and powerful, he just seemed somehow out of place, as if his design and animations didn't match the rest of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot seemed to be nothing special at first, but the way that it was presented was what sets it a league apart from the competition.  Favaro gets in contact with a wandering, magical girl, Amira, because of his lie of knowing how to get to a place called Helheim.  She really wants to go their and he gets stuck in a contract in which he must take her there.  Eventually they are caught up in an epic battle to save humans, angels, and demons alike.  There adventures lead them through a vast world where they meet all types of magical beings, from g-ds to zombies and everything in between.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening was slightly better than average.  Although the visuals were nice and fit the show well, the song had too much screaming in it.  Although some may like that kind of music, it isn't my cup of tea.  The ending is a different story.  The music was beautifully done and it was calming.  It was animated in a unique style that was stunning and it fit in perfectly with the music.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the anime was done beautifully and was well paced.  There was never a dull moment; it was always filled with important plot events that were exciting.  A must watch for anyone that likes anything dark, adventurous, or is just looking for something else to watch that they will love.  It gets a high recommendation!",

            "content": "Please be warned that this review may contain stuff that by some may be considered as spoilers even though no specific scenes of events of the show are described.\r\nAs far as the story goes, this anime has just another anti hero wannabe guided by fate and poorly developed emotions to save the girl and the world plot. It has no innovations whatsoever and in it's short 12 episodes it develops, in my opinion, even that poorly.\r\nThe main character is way outclassed by the world and the happenings around him, never really displaying either the physical strength or the strength of character one would expect amain character to have so that he may deal with the problems at hand. That being said i feel that his emotions and way of thinking are not developed enough on screen for us to see some actual change that would lead him from being just an average bounty hunting rogue to a man who would give his life for a girl or an even higher purpose at that. All in all i consider him to be one of the most boring, weak and underdeveloped main characters i've ever seen in an anime.\\n\r\nThe girl of this story is even less developed, being a crybaby of epic proportions. She is unable to do anything or resist anything when it really counts even though she is considerably strong normally. As a matter of fact she is a lot stronger than the hero so the whole giving in thing just creates the sensation that it is done on purpose so that the story can move on and so that she needs rescuing when she normally could have just ended most problems very easily on her own.\\n\r\nThe \"team\" has 2 more characters one of which is the former knight (also very weak) who doesn't actually do anything other that waste dialogue time from the start till the end of the show and a zombie girl who is the most interesting concept of a character in this show but we actually get to see too little of her.\\n\r\nThe rest of the side characters have virtually no development and are just casually thrown in here and there so that the story may advance with the exception of Jean who gets a few more minutes of screen time. She is the only human capable of actually doing anything but ultimately gets shut down in a runabout way which also gives the sensation that it is done so that the main character may get the chance to step up and be the hero himself.\\n\r\nThis leads us to the main problem of the show which is the bad guys. Personally I am one of those twisted guys that enjoy a good villain more than a good hero most of the time because he can spice things up and admittedly a hero's greatness can most times be measured by the greatness of his nemesis. I wasn't expecting to find an \"Uchiha Madara\" in this show but come on. It felt like the villain here didn't have any kind of end game other than the \"watch the world burn\" scenario and we are not even shown why or how he got there.It is not even clear weather he is a demon or a human and how it is exactly that he does what he does. Everything about him is shrouded in vagueness and he is taken down ridiculously easy, easier in fact than most of his so called pawns.\\n\r\nAs far as the art goes its is the only feature that i find pretty good as it kind of combines western concepts of knights, armors, castles and so forth with purely anime based concepts of angels, demons and spells. The sound effects and music are also, to say the least, enjoyable.",

To keep him away of the world gods and demons have a seal they keep in their worlds.\r\nOne day a girl call Amira who only knows she has to find her mother on a land called Helheim arrives to Earth, she brings a amulet which is damaged and she can\u2019t go there, but one night in a tavern she hears a bounty hunter called Favaro saying he\u2019s going to Helheim and he knows an short cut. Amira proposes Favaro a deal who acceptsto take her to Helheim, but to make sure he keeps part of the deal she puts him a demon tale, it can only disappear once they get to their destination.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime must be one of the best of 2014, it\u2019s full of moments of plenty of action and made with imagination, we can see bounty hunters, knights, living dead and even the historic character of Joan of Arc. The animation it\u2019s very well done and the design of the landscapes and characters show several hours of work. On the other hand I think the story it a bit dense by having so many characters participating on it, and there are things they could have changed like the moment Favaro rips off Kaisar\u2019s left arm.\\n\\n\r\nFor me there are three characters that are very bored like Hamsa, the duck accompanying Bacchus, he barely makes something in the serie. Bacchus spends most of the inside a wagon and drinking. And Kaisar Lidfort, a knight who belonged to an important family and blames Favaro of all his disgraces, his emotive nature can be irritating.\\n\\n\r\nFew are the animes that attracted me or I haven\u2019t finished watching but this one was worth watch it until the end. \\n",

Concepts such as traversing the Atlantic for colonization, migrating across the western half of North America, or scouting Europe for a new trade route sound fantastical. During the \"Age of Discovery,\" embarking on an adventure was the norm, with riches and prospects the rewards. Nowadays, an \"adventure\" usually consists of driving the car to the local toy store. But suppose an opportunity presented itself. Would you shy away from what lie before you, or would you follow your destiny? As Shingekino Bahamut: Genesis shows, \"it's not the destination that matters, but the journey.\"\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nBahamut begins with the stoic Kaisar chasing after the carefree Favaro. One night, Favaro accidentally makes a deal with a woman named Amira. And from there, the story truly kicks off.\\n\\n\r\nSomething that Bahamut executes extremely well is in creating the atmosphere. Medieval towns, magical powers, bounty hunting, angels and demons, dragons, zombies, pirates, massive creatures, war; there is so much attached to the world, and it definitely comes off this way. It simply feels like an adventure. Watching Amira and Favaro dance in a pub or Kaisar and Rita crashing a boat generate an overall mood that is nothing short of wondrous. Dabbling into so many different areas may cause an anime to spread itself thin, but Bahamut's ability to handle any sort of fictional event that it creates gives it another edge. Examples such as a fog-filled town or dealing with the kidnap of a friend give the characters the scenarios to be themselves, have the plot progress, and allow the action to unfold. It's constant and clever situations the whole way through, making it never a dull moment.\\n\\n\r\nBahamut takes a small misstep when it transitions away from the action and the setting. And that is in the development of its characters. It diverts many resources into making the mood feel perfect at all times (and it does this job wonderfully), but it causes the cast to fall on the wayside. Much of the character development is done through intermittent flashbacks that give just enough information at the time to craft an idea behind how the characters came to be. And this is done for the big three -- Favaro, Kaisar, and Amira. Especially so in Amira's case; the reveals about her origin, and who she truly is, is done rather hastily, conflicting with the delicate and fine world-building that surrounds her. As the plot progresses, the characters subsequently settle issues among one another, but the only person who seems to change his core beliefs is Favaro. Given how unique the cast is, it's a shame that such a blunder was encountered.\\n\\n\r\nDespite being all about adventure, Bahamut does instill a thematic presence. And it's present from the very beginning until the very end. And this is the idea that nothing can be done alone. Hearkening back to my small preview, there existed ordinary men and women who did extraordinary things. Abraham Lincoln uniting the North and the South, or Marie Curie winning Nobel Prizes comes to mind. While individually their achievements are phenomenal, they couldn't have done it alone. That is, not without the help of those around them. The same can be said for Favaro and the gang. As much as he or Jeanne de Arc wish to fulfill their tasks by themselves, it's just not possible. Furthermore, it doesn't matter who. Whether it is a close rival giving one the motivation to push onward or two conflicting sides making amends to thwart a third evil, events in life are never tackled alone. There is always someone there to bring the support, and Bahamut demonstrates this beautifully.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nBahamut pulls out all the stops when it comes to art and animation.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style also contributes to the feeling of adventure that permeates the show. Mountainous backdrops, glistening forests, Gothic cities, and hazy torture chambers are a small sampling of the varying environments offered. Everything is packed with detail, of both the 2D and 3D variety. The show utilizes expert lighting and camera work, providing the show with an overall pretty shine.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are also varied and unique. Favaro's orange afro and scar, Kaisar's regal outfit, Amira's witch and commoner attire, and Rita's tiny hat with skull-based umbrella make the characters standout not only within their own show but among other anime titles. Their faces forego traditional trends of big eyes and flat faces, instead opting for a more mature, human look. This adds a sense of \"realism\" to the characters that makes them fit their roles and actions more believably.\\n\\n\r\nAs for actual animation, it is quite stellar. Characters move fluidly, and their expressions are not only visible but movable. The fight scenes incorporate nice choreography, giving the show even more reasons to tout its adventurous trait. From nuclear explosions to flying zombie arms, anything and everything is given a high amount of animation and detail, making all that is contained within rather energetic and alive.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nFor Bahamut, its characters are a rather interesting assortment of people.\\n\\n\r\nThe last to be added to the troupe, Rita is described as being an undead-necromancer-\"loli\" zombie. Hundreds of years old yet the height of a child, she hardly ever lets her emotions get the best of her. Having spent much time essentially alone, she finds solace in the fact that Kaisar and the rest bring her into the group. Wielding deathly powers and alchemical magic, Rita is the resident plot mover, giving Favaro and the gang the chances needed to escape or otherwise cheat death -- much like she's done herself. With a ton of wisdom and a strange amount of caring for her new friends, if the four of them were a family, she'd be the doting grandmother, watching from a distance but always ready to help.\\n\\n\r\nAs a one-winged fallen demon, Amira is a complex creature. Her childlike attitude, constant hunger, and gullibility make her out to be more kid than young woman. Willing to move forward as opposed to resting on her laurels, she accepts the help of Favaro and the others to bring about her dream of meeting her mother once more in the land of Helheim. Rather resilient and immensely powerful in combat, she is no pushover when it comes to taking on the people standing in her way. Following the family idea once more, she would easily be the grandchild, upon which the others must constantly watch over.\\n\\n\r\nKaisar is a knight of proud descent. Chivalrous, strong, and handsome, he personifies what it means to be a ladies' man. His feud with Favaro forces him to follow his flippant foe. And as he does, he encounters Amira, the lady he wants to protect, and Rita, the woman he is constantly chided by. Willing to do what is right regardless of what it means for his own safety, Kaisar's determination to see events through to their end propels him from everyday soldier to incredible commander. His role is easily that of the mother.\\n\\n\r\nThe fan-favorite (and mine, too) falls to Favaro. Rather crass and unruly, he prefers to have fun at all times, before, during, and after fighting. He starts the tale without a tail and without direction, not fully realizing the gravity of the situation he has found himself in. Overtime, he learns from the others what it means to be a better person. From Rita, he gains the confidence to be the kind of man he should have always been. From Kaisar, he sees what willful and prideful drive can accomplish. And from Amira, he learns that being selfish doesn't bring about change, but compassion for others that does. By the adventure's end, Favaro transitions from a narrow-minded buffoon to a legendary hero. Asking himself, \"Which way does the wind blow,\" he easily represents the father for the four.\\n\\n\r\nThe interpretation of the main cast acting as a singular family -- Rita the grandmother, Amira the child, Kaisar the mother, and Favaro the father -- isn't a large extrapolation. Not only do their characterizations and developments paint them as such, but the core theme tying them all together does as well. This theme is, of course, the idea that family is more than just a relationship. Each of them does what they do and becomes who they are because of their family. Rita's first life was based on the love she had for her parents, and her second life was caused by it, too. Amira's sole purpose, her only reason for living is seeking out the one woman with whom she has the deepest of connections: her mother. Kaisar is motivated by the wrongdoings against his own father and besmirching of his family name. And Favaro saw what became of his own father, and therefore pushed away the ideals given to him; but eventually he took to heart the kind of person his old man had always embodied. Before anything else, family comes first. Friends come and go, work buddies are made and lost, and strangers are passed. But family is always there, both within and around everyone.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is one word: amazing. The hard guitar, tough drums, and coarse singing make it an adrenaline rush on every listen. The first half is epic and the second half is hopeful. It goes down as one of the top OPs of the year.\\n\\n\r\nThe ED completely contrasts the OP. It's soft, calming, and beautiful. The piano and violins give it a pretty arrangement, and the vocalist has an incredible range.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is filled with orchestral pieces and choir singing during the tensest of moments, and Spanish-like heroic tunes during the more triumphant ones. They further add onto the adventure-like quality of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nVoice-acting sees above average work with most of the cast. A stand-out performance is had by Hiroyuki Yoshino as Favaro, perfectly capturing the fun-loving, crossbow-wielding bounty hunter.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nIt's fascinating where this one started. When it was first announced, it was written off as nothing more than a silly card-game adaptation. But after the first episode, it truly became something more. It began proving what such out-of-left-field ideas can do. Crazy set-pieces, unique characters, and mythological happenings all in one place, and all done well, make it its own, rather rewarding product.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is actually quite funny at times, but the action and flashiness of it all makes it worthwhile. Watching a fast-paced duel between Favaro and Kaisar or seeing angels erect barriers to prevent a disaster provided many opportunities to just sit back and say, \"Now that is cool.\"\\n\\n\r\nAs my final anime of Fall 2014, Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis goes out with a bang. Its adventure-filled story, familial characters, stunning animation, and killer music make it more than just a show based on a card game.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Good, perfect adventure, misguided character development, solid theme\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Great, beautiful art, unique character designs, above average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, Rita, Amira, Kaisar, and Favaro are strongly tied to family\\n\\n\r\nSound: Great, great OP, good ED, good soundtrack, above average VA work\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Great, funny, eye-catching, and completely out of nowhere\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 9/10",

            "content": "It's always rather interesting to see what sort of direction a new animation studio takes. Being fresh onto the anime landscape gives you a ton of options to choose from. Will you take the easy path of cute girls and slice of life, or will it be the hard road of heavy action and grandly designed set pieces? As of now, after the three main titles from our latest studio to be born, I'm very happy to say that Studio MAPPA has chosen to take the high road, and the possibilities for their future areonly looking brighter every day. So, what sort of work has this budding studio produced lately?\\n\\n\r\n          On the surface, the story seems like a fairly generic setup for a high fantasy adventure, and that's because it is, but there's so much diversity and life brought into this world that it has definitely become a standout setting amongst a backlog of complex high fantasies and Lord of the Rings imitations. There are so many different aspects to this world that are mentioned as either key plot points or just passing glances, and it really helps to create a deep and vibrant world for the characters to interact in. All of this came together to create what I felt was one of the strongest starts to an anime this season.\\n\\n\r\n          That being said, the story itself still feels a bit generic sometimes and ended up being a bit more predictable than I would have liked. Some moments definitely felt like they were starting to check their high fantasy storytelling guidelines a bit too much. There were also quite a few moments where there was actually too much going on and it was a bit hard to focus on the relevant details, and a lot of them ended up getting lost in the shuffle of back and forth tradeoffs of mythological terminology. However, I did find that I was able to overlook a lot of that because this series truly becomes a spectacle to watch. Sure there's a ton of complicated back story going on somewhere, but a good deal of the series is focused solely on its spectacle of epic chases and grandly orchestrated battles.\\n\\n\r\n          The main group of characters, while fairly standard at first, do become endearing enough for me to actually care about. Favaro is our slacker-funnyman bounty hunter charged with escorting Amira to Helheim, and he also seems to take the usual path of being reluctant at first and then gradually warming up to her, but he's such an energetic and colorful character that his generic nature hardly ever shows up. Amira also manages to transcend the quest item/damsel in distress role and actually turns out to be an incredibly powerful fighter, though this is more so due to the fact that she's actually a demon. Kaiser also stands out as our typical white knight character with a grudge against Favaro, but the emotional torment that he goes through on this journey still makes him incredibly likable and endearing.\\n\\n\r\n          However, the minor characters end up being a bit weak by comparison, though that's mostly due to the fact that there are so many of them, with most of them being deities of some sort with either a heavenly or demonic leaning. While some do exist as characters in their own rights, most of them are there simply to advance the plot and are swiftly dropped from the story when they no longer become relevant. Furthermore, I'm not really sure how the Japanese view western mythology and biblical characters, but to have three completely separate characters named Beelzebub, Lucifer, and Satan was extremely confusing for a good portion of the series.\\n\\n\r\n          As previously mentioned, the animation was produced by Studio MAPPA (Terror in Resonance, Garo the Animation), and as a spectacle of gigantic set pieces and grandly orchestrated battles, this anime was an incredible sight to behold. Everything about this series felt immense in size and really helped to push the hype for the series forward. The character designs were also incredibly detailed and original, adding a much needed refresher to the usual fantasy character tropes. However, I do have to point out that there is a massive amount of CG in this series, and a lot of it didn't look as good as it could have been. It's understandable that the scope of this series is so massive that you have to save time and render certain objects in CG, but there were still some moments where it just looked really bad. As for Bahamut himself, I found myself feeling a little bit disappointed. Yes, he certainly felt very threatening, but again, the CG work wasn't all that it could have been, though thankfully it did not give me any flashbacks to the original Fate/Stay Night.\\n\\n\r\n          There is currently no dub for this series, though a FUNimation dub in the distant future isn't out of the question.\\n\\n\r\n          The soundtrack was composed by Yoshihiro Ike (Ergo Proxy, Karas), and this is definitely one of the most massive-sounding soundtracks I've heard this season. Huge, bombastic orchestration combined with grandiose choirs and pounding percussion drummed up a huge level of excitement for each battle, but there were also quite a few more adventurous themes, particularly the music associated with Favaro, which actually had a bit of a bullfighter flair to it. The opening theme \"EXiSTENCE\" by SiM blasts into each episode with a massively metal \"Engrish\" track, while the ending theme \"Promised Land\" by Risa Shimizu (VA for Amira) plays us out with a rolling ballad.\\n\\n\r\n          Overall, while the spectacle aspects of Rage of Bahamut were incredibly exciting, a good portion of the story and characters were rather difficult to follow, and the massive amount of unrefined CG took away from a few of the bigger moments.",

            "content": "Shingeki No Bahamut: Genesis/ Rage of Bahamut: Genesis Spoiler Free Review\r\nFirst I would like to state that prior to watching this series I had no idea that it was intended to be a promotional series for a mobile card game, however, taking that into account it only adds to my appreciation for the series.\r\nI will sometimes just abbreviate the series as SBG to keep things simple, and I will be breaking down this review into a few components: Story, Art/Animation, Sound, Character and overall feelings. \r\nSBG is a series I had high hopes for and was waiting in anticipation to finish. I took up theseries immediately as the last episode was uploaded to Hulu Plus and I enjoyed finishing it in just two nights. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10 Now SBG does not have a totally original or brand new concept for a story. I wont break down and run you through the whole thing as I would like people to watch it and enjoy for themselves, but here is some of my thoughts. To be quite honest, SBG is a typical story seen done many times throughout anime history. Despite this, how well it is executed and the great cast of lead and supporting characters is what makes it into an epic and fun watch. There is a great blend of enough comedy, action, adventure, and fantasy to make SBG into something epic. Although it starts off very episodic meaning that each episode was a different venture or such, when the series hits about episode 6 it takes on a main arc if you will. This arc takes on a more serious tone however it still manages to implement just the right amount of humor to keep things fresh. The ending is not a massive cliffhanger leaving you begging for more and all in all the story is just very well executed.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 10/10 Art and animation is where SBG truly excels. I remember seeing the trailer for this series back in the spring of 2014, and it immediately gripped my attention with its seemingly smooth CG animation and vibrant colors. Now being able to watch it all the way through all I can say is WOW. The world that was created for SBG is truly a work of artistic masterpiece IMO. It was amazing to see shades and hues of colors that are rarely used in anime. The color pallet is truly very broad and the studio utilized tons of colors. A perfect example of this is in an episode that has our main protagonists taking a dip in a lake. As they look off into the distance they see a beautiful sky filled with 6 different shades of lavenders and purples that all work together in beautiful fashion. I just found it very refreshing to see such a broad range of colors being used instead of being presented with a typical landscape or such. Character models are very unique with one exception. In all honesty one of the main protagonists, Kaisar is really just a Space Dandy clone LOL. But other than him, character models are very well done. The main protagonist Favaro, is very unique and not what you would expect from a lead and the models for all the various demons and Gods were very well done. Lastly we have the fight animation. Whenever I know CG is present in a series I become very skeptical, as it either works and I love it or the contrary. Luckily SBG did a great job of seamlessly integrating the CG models with the traditional style. The CG is very smooth flowing and does not move awkwardly like sometimes seen in other series. The fights in SBG are very smooth and lack any sense of \"lazy animation\" ie things such as constant flashes and pings. SBG nailed the animation aspect.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10 There is one thing that is most memorable about SBG's sound and that has to be the opening track. Now this is very very very subjective (as is this whole thing as it is a review LOL but you get me) but i gotta say the opening track is just pure badass and adds an intense feel to the cool opening animation. Other than that however, SBG does not have an overwhelmingly great soundtrack. It is filled with orchestral notes and symphonies and is mostly only head during a fight scene or such. These sounds are not the most memorable but they do a solid job of adding the needed ambiance and feel to certain scenes. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9.5/10 SBG has three main characters and a great cast of supports. I will discuss the three leads individually and the supports as a whole. First off we have Favaro, the selfish and funny yet loving bounty hunter. Favaro is a great lead as he is not what you would typically expect from an adventure/fantasy series. He is VERY selfish and really only wants to look out for his own good but for some reason he is always very likable due to his great sense of humor and comedic actions. He develops into a very strong lead with a strong will and determination and he is easily one of the most different leads i have seen in a while. Next we have the mysterious girl Amira. Amira is an uber powerful girl who despite her power, is very child like. She seems to be blind to the world and like a child, only focuses on what she truly desires. She learns a ton from Favaro and their companions through their trials and despite her sense of babyness, she never becomes annoying. I never thought to myself \"WHY IS SHE ALIVE OR WHY CANT SHE JUST DIE?!??\" as I do with many other characters of her archetype. She adds to the humor and comedy of the story but still manages to maintain her sense of badassery as she is truly a powerful character in literal terms. Next up the Space Dandy clone Kaisar who is the exact opposite of our other lead Favaro. Kaisar maintains a constant sense of seriousness and pride throughout the series and his comedic actions incidentally come from being constantly duped by Favaro. Kaisar is still a great character however, and is very likable due to his sense of justice and willingness to do the right thing. Now the support characters, who I feel complete the show. There are many supports on all three sides meaning the humans, demons, and gods. All of the supports are very unique and add more to the series rather than being stereotypical bystanders. One support in particular, Rita became a personal favorite of mine and she adds a ton of comedy through her stoic conversations and by always putting down Favaro's stupid actions. Overall SBG has a great cast of characters that dont see too drastic of a development as the series is only 12 episodes long, but they are a very likable cast and they never really seem to fit stereotypical archetypes that we normally see.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Thoughts: Overall I am rating this series a solid 9.5 as I truly did enjoy it a ton. I was surprised by this series and found it to be a truly wonderful experience. I did not think going into watching this that i would fall in love with the cast, the art, and the world that as created. I feel this is an underrated series and I dont believe that its connections to a game should bog down its rating or anyones feelings about it. If you are looking for a fun and epic adventure filled to the brim with action, Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis will not disappoint. Thank you for reading and i really hope you found my review helpful.",

            "content": "A fun, action fantasy adventure with gorgeous visuals and a charming cast.\r\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\r\nRage of Bahamut isn\u2019t the most amazing or original show out there, but it\u2019s without a doubt thoroughly enjoyable. It doesn\u2019t try to be deep or complex. It has a Pirates of the Caribbean feel of fun and adventure. It\u2019s a story about a bounty hunter helping a girl get to her destination, but they get swept up in the bigger picture involving humans, angels, demons, and a world destroying dragon.\r\nThe first thing you\u2019ll notice about Bahamut is it\u2019s a very good looking show. The fantasy setting is a breath of fresh air fromseeing yet another high school classroom. The fantasy elements aren\u2019t trying to re-invent the wheel. You\u2019ve got swords, giant crabs, necromancy, and hot demon chicks. The quality animation keeps every episode and scene a treat to look at.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are refreshing, too. The main character isn\u2019t a generic pretty boy with bangs or impossible spikes. He\u2019s got a red afro, he\u2019s tan\u2014even his personality is fun from the usual apathetic or wimpy or try-hard main characters. Everyone is drawn much more to proportion which is also refreshing from the usual moe baby features and bug eyes.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast is kept small. You\u2019ve got your care-free main character who\u2019s just looking out for himself so he\u2019s got questionable morals. He has a righteous knight after him for revenge, but they have great buddy chemistry. There\u2019s a na\u00efve demon girl trying to find her mother, and even a little zombie girl with a \u201cdeadpan\u201d look on her face that injects some pragmatism in the their plans.\\n\\n\r\nThe story starts off lightheartedly to reel you in while the visuals and setting keeps you hooked, but it escalates until they\u2019re on the verge of bringing back a 2,000 year old apocalypse. Some might regret that it loses its initial charm, but the characters keep you invested even if the story becomes a generic \u201csave the world.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t have any gripes. At best you could say the fantasy story isn\u2019t original, but even that is an un-original, almost dishonest complaint against anything. Everything\u2019s been done so you can only put new twists on it. Bahamut is easily one of 2014\u2019s best shows, and shouldn\u2019t be missed.\\n\\n",

            "content": "It appears that every fucking anime has to have some correlation to school, you've got zombies at school with tits, demons at school with tits, and Angels at school with tits.  What happens though if I were to cleverly combine all of said supernatural creatures into a fantasy world setting, dispose of all the high schools and tits, and supply some entertaining pieces?  Well you've got the anime I shall be reviewing today, Shingeki no Bahamut: Neon Genesis!  Let's have an adventure shall we.  Adventure is out there! *shows UP*\r\nShingeki no Bahamut is produced by studio MAPPA, who produced a personalfavorite anime Kids on the Slope, and the anime that literally blew itself to pieces right when the MILF was introduced, Zankyou no Terror.  It is a fantasy anime which aired in the Fall season of 2014 consisting of 12 episodes licensed by Funimation.  So, in my thoughts is Shingeki no Bahamut good?  I'd say it's pretty decent if you ask me, and I shall elaborate my points so let's initiate with the story.\\n\\n\r\nTHE STORY\\n\r\nIn the vast land of Mistarcia filled with mystical creatures, humans, demons and gods at one point in history sealed and froze a fearsome Dragon by the name of Bahamut.  Afterwards, the angels and demons were both bestowed one key that was split into 2 that maintains Bahamut in its frozen state thus sealing its power.  Flashforward 2,000 years later we follow our main protagonist Favaro, a scheming bounty hunter who likes women, money and booze encounters a female by the name of Amira, who turns out to be a demon who has an objective to reach the land of Helheim just to see her mother.  Now, Favaro must embark on a quest with Amira to journey to Helheim, but the road may not be as simple as he initially thinks.  Is Amira hiding something?  Are the demons plotting something?  What is really at Helheim?  How far will Favaro go?\\n\\n\r\nFirstly I must state that Bahamut does a fine job at establishing its world.  It establishes that there are 3 worlds, one with gods humans and demons, and we are shown a vast world out there with city areas, a kingdom, forests, and much more.  But as great as the foundation for the world is, not much is sadly explored, the world can only be seen at face value with not much content packed into their environments, I would have loved to see more of the god and demon world but sadly we didn\u2019t get much.  \\n\\n\r\nI believe where most of the problems lie is within the pacing of Bahamut which was more inconsistent than the sizes of penises at a male strip bar.  Sometimes the plot jumps from place to place unnaturally without any knowledge or explanation on how characters got to where they are, it almost feels like you\u2019re playing call of duty and the enemy lags right in front of you, there is that missing gap between point A and B that due to rushed pacing isnt filled and is just left as null and void.\\n\\n\r\nBut you know what, when Bahamut wants to be cool, it\u2019s cooler than a Harlem apartment in winter.  The action set pieces are exceptionally satisfying with slick choreography and some pretty genius tactics that left me each time feeling like a delighted customer.  There seems to be a pattern nowadays with some shows having pointless skirmishes that in the end result meant absolutely nothing but thankfully in Bahamut almost all of the fights have something at stake, whether it be for justified revenge or even the fate of the world, there is something a character can lose.  \\n\\n\r\nThis is widely thanks to just the pure energy the show has to offer.  All the characters, mostly my n*gga Favaro all bring this sort of high octane energy to the show allowing for not only the action scenes but simple scenes like dancing at the bar and even just down to the dialogue to be hella fun.  The dialogue is witty with character interactions being believable and at points more hilarious the fact I\u2019ve never had a girlfriend.  \\n\r\nShingeki no Bahamut follows the TV trope rule of cool which I shall flash the definition for onscreen, and by doing this some implausibility can be excused, but then again this doesn't cover up plot holes that the series had.  Also the characters act way too over dramatic for people they just met creating some sense of unbelievability within the characters.  \\n\\n\r\nJust as some side notes, I love how they incorporated figures like Jean d\u2019arc in its fantasy setting, that was pretty legit.  The lack of any fan service was a personal plus for me and the tone managed to maintain a serious tone when serious and a comedic tone when comedic never breaking the tone and keeping its consistency intact.\\n\\n\r\nTo finish off with the story section I want to discuss the ending which in my mind was decent but could have been handled sooooooo much better.  To be honest it felt inconclusive in lots of ways with loose ends still needing to be tied, and felt anticlimactic if you ask me.  I\u2019m about to spoil something right now so cover your ears before you get spoiled.\\n\\n\r\nOkay so one huge reason why I did not really favor the conclusion is because of how much of a disappointment Bahamut was after he was revived.  Throughout the anime we are constantly reminded on the destructive power of Bahamut yet in the very end Bahamut was taken down easy.  It's like playing super mario 3D world, you're hyping up Bowser going to be really tough when in reality after all you went through he turned out easier than previous bosses, honestly it was a shame.\\n\\n\r\nDespite all of the flaws I had with the story, Bahamut\u2019s story is fun and exciting with great action sequences and lots of energy with cool ideas and dialogue that all follow the rule of cool but sadly is anticlimactic in the end and establishes a vast world foundation without that much depth added to it thanks to the inconsistent pacing.\\n\\n\r\nTHE CHARACTERS\\n\r\nThe characters of Shingeki no Bahamut are fun with different personalities to balance each other out.\\n\\n\r\nFavaro, he\u2019s the life of the show, like how pedophiles bring life to Dateline.  He\u2019s a character who provides comedy and seriousness when needed and is characterized excellently, he feels like a very fresh protagonist which has been lacking in anime for quite a while.  He like a fresh of breath air.  Throughout the series he grows as a character and you really get to see a dynamic change from the selfishness you witness in the beginning as he turns more selfless and starts to care for the people around him, especially growing an attachment to Amira which is something he never desired in the first place.  Hes got a decent back story that felt a tad bit rushed but it gave us a proper view on his past.  Stylish, witty, comedic, brave, shows growth, great characterization, and he\u2019s the closest thing to a n*gga in anime since Dutch, I\u013al take it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nKaiser is portrayed as Favaro\u2019s rival and is a fairly decent character, hes a knight that seems to fail more than an old man trying to hook up with hookers.  He acts upon emotion and acts without thinking for the most part, and his main objective is to kill Favaro for reasons that are explained in back story. But that is the nobility of a knight I suppose, for he has a a firm sense of justice that contrasts Favaros character.  His interactions with Favaro are great though I would have loved to see more added depth to Kaiser, but characterization was done well enough to make me give a damn about him so yayy to that.\\n\\n\r\nAmira I have mixed feelings for.  For the most part she is an interesting character but throughout the anime there was evidence of her just being a pawn moreso than a strong female character.  Don't get me wrong, shes a highly interesting character with a childlike personality for reasons that are explained, but though a pawn she never felt like a character I wished to be banished from the anime because she actually brought some humor and never felt like an annoyance on her travels.  Her characterization could have been a hell of a lot better and there isnt enough depth to call her character a good one.  But when she turns full on demon mode, she is more bad ass than Shrek, and those are the times when it\u2019s a blast to see her onscreen.\\n\\n\r\nRita is a zombie girl who cares for the main cast despite how cold she may be, and at first glance you might say, LOLI, LOLI! LOLI!!!  But she's nowhere near that archetype that you would initially speculate her to be.  Her contributions to the plot though few is helpful when needed, and we see a bit of growth for her character throughout the show to support her character.  I liked her character, she balanced everyone out whether telling Kaiser to snap back and think logically, or to shut down Favaro's stupidity.\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters could have gotten more development and characterization, especially Jean D\u2019Arc but what we got was decent.  My main flaw with the villains however is that their motivations are black and white, with their own motivation to be evil is to bring destruction, nothing more and nothing less.  They seemed to lack reasonings behind why they want destruction other than the fact that they're like ROAR IM A DEMON, but despite this at least they held somewhat of a presence onscreen.\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters of Bahamut are exciting, fun onscreen and characterized decently with some growth over time but side characters lack any type of depth and villains have black and white motivations.\\n\\n\r\nTHE ART/AMIMATION\\n\\n\r\nThe best part about Shingeki no Bahamut is the art/animation.  The art has a wide color palette with perfect colors for every environment to accompany the tone the show tries to convey.  The character designs I absolutely adore because they add to the style and flare of the show, I would have never thought I would have seen a main character with an Afro in anime, it's a revolution, black people are coming back in anime, March on Tokyo Street biatch!  This added to the rule of cool the show.  The backgrounds are detailed and the lighting for each scene was almost perfect.  The main flaw I have within the art is the CGI because it looks uglier than Meghan Fox\u2019s thumbs, it just didn\u2019t fit with the rest of the show.  The animation is fluent with no hiccups from what I could witness.  The character movements felt genuine though there is a bit of choppiness to be found and the fight scenes as stated previously were choreographed really well at various angles.  The special effects like the fog in the village and the bursts of explosions in the sky were all carefully done too adding the cherry to the pie for the art and animation.\\n\\n\r\nTHE SOUND\\n\\n\r\nSoundwise nothing much to say here, the voice acting was a job well done, especially Favaro and Kaiser\u2019s voice actors.  They packed emotion in their voices and in the case of Favaro a hint of comedy when needed.  The sound effects and mixing were spot on too.  Although the OST was fitting and was utilized splendidly, honestly I wasn\u2019t a big fan of it other than the opening song and another song in particular that I can\u2019t remember the name of.  To put it in short, it fit the tones of each scene in a sincerely great way.\\n\\n\r\nDespite all the flaws I had with Bahamut I found it to be an exhilarating and exciting story with great characters, decent music and wonderful art/animation.\\n\\n\r\nGiving the Story a 5.5\\n\r\nThe characters a 7.75\\n\r\nThe Art/Animation an 8.5\\n\r\nAnd the Sound a 6.5\\n\\n\r\nI award Bahamut with a score of 7.15 out of 10 giving it a recommendation of worth da watch.\\n",

            "content": "Shingeki no Bahamut is an anime that instantly becomes a favourite. The lack of episodes(only 12) is compensated by the interesting storyline, the beautiful and breathtaking art, and the overall Epicness of the show. The characters, especially the main one-the wild and \"handsome\" Favaro, are so unique and different that they give you a breath of fresh air. With the very first episode you are overwhelmed with the humor of the show and the character design. There are epic dragons, badass demons, lovely gods, strong warriors and interesting stuff regarding magic and powers. The ending is very satisfying and doesn't leave you hanging like manyanime series do. If you are wondering whether to watch it or not, i recommend watching  just the opening first, because it shows the amount of detail and the magnificent visuals (and the epic song by the band SiM)\\n\r\nThere are no cheesy, echy moments, so I think the anime is compatible with every kind of anime fan. I would also recommend it to people who have not yet watched anime!",

            "content": "Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis, by all accounts, should have been a completely forgettable and mediocre show having the pretense of being a teaser anime for Cygames and their mobile card game. The source material has the plot of a piece of cardboard and is little more than a collection of conceptual artwork. With all those things in mind, Studio MAPPA rises to the challenge and completely shatters my non-existent expectations as they set the standard for a promotional show.  \r\nTaking place within a fantasy setting where the combined efforts of mankind, gods and demons have successfully sealed away the world-destroying Bahamut, the world ofMistarcia enters into an era of peace. To insure that Bahamut would be forever encaged in its prison, the seal's key was split into two pieces and given to the gods and demons respectively. Two thousand years, a  women named Amira manages to steal the gods' half of the key and that where the show chooses to kick off its epic adventure. Caught up in Amira's quest to reach the land of Helhelm are two bounty hunters with clashing sets of personalities and values. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot is simple enough and easy to follow but Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis's strength lies in its brilliant execution and ever-escalating set pieces. Human, monsters, gods and demons of all different shapes and sizes come in for a battle royale that never fails to disappoint because the action is paced to be fast and furious which leaves little room for exposition. This actually works in the show's favor because it let the viewer's knowledge of other fantasy shows fill in the gaps instead of piling on explanations that would only get in the way. Fights takes place in varying degrees of captivating environments as the show overwhelm the viewers with its extravaganza displays.  It does fall victim to losing momentum towards the middle portion as a dreaded recap episode shows up and the political maneuvering is less interesting than the hordes of monsters and soldiers duking it out with each other. Fortunately enough, it does manage to pick itself up to throws everything and everyone into speculate of the grand finale.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nHaving nothing but character illustrations as their starting point, the production staff MAPPA have crafted some very lovable characters that are all distinct in their attributes and eccentric personalities. It's not all about the action as the main characters are given fleshed out \\n\r\nbackstorys and motivations rather than being  Amria is actually a very strong demonic melee fighter capable of tearing apart much larger monsters with ease but acts very much like a child in spite of her terrifying power and outward appearance. She is quite endearing and the focal point of which the show drives itself. \\n\\n\r\nSmitten by her looks and misguide notions, Kaisar Lidford is one the two bounty hunters accompanying Amria on her quest to reunite with her mother. A former knight that was disgraced, he still retains his code of honor in every fiber of his being and that extends to his fighting style, hair, and upkeep of his promises. He was overly the knight-in-shining-armor to a fault but I did warm up to him as the series went on as his character dynamics complement the other members of main cast.  \\n\\n\r\nThis brings me to my two favorite characters of Favaro Leone and Rita. To start off, Favaro is nothing like your conventional hero as his goal in life is to loudly indulge in life's guilty pleasures of women, money and booze while. As a red-headed bounty hunter, he is selfish, crass and utterly underhanded when it comes to fighting while wielding a revolver crossbow. \\n\\n\r\nHow awesome is that? \\n\\n\r\nEqually fabulous is Rita, who joins up with the main cast a little further down the story. She may look like loli bait but never adheres to the stereotypical template that her appearance suggested. Her character interactions and contributions made the show that much more enjoyable on top of what was already offered. \\n\\n\r\nThere is a myriad of other supporting characters from all the different race who don't really get or need character development but make the most of their limited screentime in just being plain awesome. Some standouts include Jeanne D'Arc of the humans, Bacchus, a god who manages the bounty system and Azazel of the demon faction. \\n\\n\r\nVisuals\\n\\n\r\nAnimated by the Studio MAPPA, the very same team who created Kids on the Slope and Zankyou no Terror, the amount of quality put into this series places it among the best looking shows of the 2014 fall season. Drawing inspiration from Western fantasy aesthetics, the art style is atypical of the standard Japanese anime look and has that classic Dungeons and Dragons vibe to it. The attention to detail to the various locales and props really help immerse the audience into the world of  Rage of Bahamut: Genesis and that not even mentioning the stellar cinematography which lends itself to be more of a Hollywood film than standard anime show. There are small amounts of 3DCGI and for the most part, it looks all right as it doesn't distracts from the pretty 2D visuals.   \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nYoshihiro Ike, who scored the soundtrack to Ergo Proxy and Tiger and Bunny, comes in with a full orchestra and choir to deliver something that didn't really live up to the epic action on the screen. His work, by all means, was well-composed and of high quality but I couldn't help but feel that the music was rather uninspired  and lack the punch to bring the show to the next level. More specifically, it may be due to the lack of variety when it comes to just relying on strings and vocal as I found hard to recall anything memorable. Perhaps, if he had used more instruments in his ensemble, it would be an given the visuals the accompaniment and energy it deserves. In contrast, the opening credits, \"EXiSTENCE\u201d performed by SiM, was one of my favorites of the fall season with it rock music and awkward Engrish. It does what every opening should do and that is to be extremely metal and awesome in priming the viewers for each weekly installment. \\n\\n\r\nGame Adaption\\n\\n\r\nIf Studio MAPPA had the goal of making me try out whatever they were advertising for, \\n\\n\r\nthey succeeded.   \\n\\n\r\nShingeki no Bahamut: Genesis was amazing enough that I simply wanted more and what better way to do so than to download the game it's based off of. However, upon seeing the chunky dated interface, confusing bland gameplay and obvious microtransactions, I promptly deleted it off my machine. I'm grateful that aspects of the trading card game were integrated quite well in the framework of the show of which was the bounty system and I never felt it was overbearing or obnoxious. It was just a small reminder of what the show's roots are and just how vastly difference they are in terms of quality.  \\n\\n\r\nConclusion \\n\\n\r\nComing completely out of the left field, Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis is the surprise hit of the 2014 fall season. I simply cannot give enough praise to Studio MAPPA for their creativity and talent in creating a show that defies all expectations. There were a few small things that held it back from being a masterpiece, but nevertheless it was still one hell of a ride. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 8.5/10\\n",

            "content": "In depth review #2 - Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis\r\nShingeki no Bahamut was exactly what i wanted it to be. An epic battle fantasy anime with good characters and a unique universe that blended everything together. And DRAGONS, beautifully animated hardcore FUCKING DRAGONS! Most shows with dragons in it makes their dragons look like shitty play-doh statues but this show did i right. All you need to do is see the first scene of the show and you'll know what I'm talking about. If there are any gamers reading this, imagine the game Darksiders mixed with the opening cinematic trailer of Final Fantasy XIV and thatis basically Shingeki no Bahamut in a nutshell, epic.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8.25 (Very Good)\\n\r\nThe story revolves around Bahamut, an all-powerful dragon's rebirth into the world. When this dragon was alive, It's cataclysmic rampage nearly ended all life on the planet. This truth forced humans, angels, and demons to form a temporary trues to seal this dragon away forever. From the backlash of the battle, the god Zeus and Satan himself had to sacrifice themselves by sealing their spirits in two pendants to stop him. If the two keys where to merge again, then Bahamut will be reborn and fuck shit up again. The show start off with a girl how steels one of the keys from the angels and begins the process of Bahamut's inevitable resurrection. I personally thought the story was amazing. It wasn't super convoluted and was easy to understand. Yes, its kind of a genetic (seal to big bad dragon before we get rekted) story but the journey, and back-story behind the characters separated this one from the rest. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 9 (Great)\\n\r\nThe animation was so clean i could of ate off of it. Nothing but stunning. The atmosphere and backgrounds are well flushed and polished. Details can be seen in the smallest of the things on the scene that most people wont even be looking at. In addition, things such as particle were shy of perfection. The sparks that flew of off swords as they clash, the radiant illuminations that where emitted from angles and demons eyes and bodies, the smoke and stones that flew threw through the air during a huge battle. All of these entities were beautifully animated. This is what initially got me watching the series in the first place. The production value for the animation was one of the best of 2014; up there with Fate/Stay Night and Nagino no Asukara. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8 (Very Good)\\n\r\nThe sound that played in the background of certain scenes set the tone of the sequence. They did a good job at doing this since some of the less notable scenes in the anime also made me feel a certain way. It wasn't what was going on, on the scene but was the music that complemented them them gave me the intended anticipation, or unease. For the epic fight scenes in the anime, all i could say it that the music was great. The heavy orchestrated tracks made the battle scenes even more epic then they already were. It's apparent that a lot of time and work went into developing this OST and i wanted to listen to the stand alone tracks but i couldn't find them. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7.5 (Good)\\n\r\nI'm happy to say that the creators didn't play a mindless game of (spin the wheel of generic character archetypes) when making theirs. Almost all of the character's personalities and designs felt new. The main characters were at there very peak when they interacted with each other (Favaro x Kaiser) (Favaro x Rita), however as stand alone characters they weren't as memorable as they could have been. The only exception this this would of had been Favaro. Speaking of, the main character Favaro the most unique person of the bunch. His mindset throughout the show generally stays the same but his own resolve and personality makes him like no other. Not only is his personality unique but his design is to. Favora is actually rocking an AFRO MULLET. I'm not joking here, this is a thing now. For the other main characters, Kaiser is the epitome of a knight. We will do anything to keep his vows and restore honor to his families name. Amira is kind of simple minded but has a goal that she want to achieve. It seems that's all she wants to do; that and eat food. All of the other supporting characters is also well developed.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9 (Great)\\n\r\nI really enjoyed watching this anime. I binged through the entire thing in a day and wasn't dissatisfied. The beginning is a tab slow but shit gets real around episode 6 & 7. If you pass this threshold, you wont be disappointed at all. It an anime that truly shocked me and i believe to be one of the better amines of 2014. If you like action animes, then this is a must watch because you will be blow away.\\n\\n\r\nScore: 8.35/10 (Good) - Must Watch\\n\\n",

            "content": "If the word \u2018adventure\u2019 is part of your daily vocabulary, then Shingeki no Bahamut is definitely something to consider watching. Based off a card game franchise, the series takes place in some sort of alternate medieval universe starring a group of young adventurers. The catch though is that the story is clouded by a dark past relating to a source of power threatening to destroy the world. That source (known as the Bahamut) was sealed away some 2000 years ago but has recently been broken and split into two in the form of keys. A cat and mouse-like game ensures now as to find thekey and determine the fate of their universe.\\n\\n\r\nAs intimidating as the title sounds, Shingeki no Bahamut is actually quite a fun show. And despite being based off a card game, there\u2019s actually no Yugioh-style duels or Cardfight Vanguard battles. Instead, what we get is a fantasy adventure involving a trio of characters \u2013 Favaro, Kaisar, and Amira. Later on, another character named Rita joins them as well. But for starters, the show doesn\u2019t start off with the three being together. In fact, it\u2019s quite the opposite as we follow the life of bounty hunter Favaro. His encounter with Amira is like fate after he unconsciously makes a contract with her; and ends up growing a tail as a consequence.  On the other hand, there\u2019s Kaisar with an almost exact opposite personality compared to Favaro. The show also introduces his purpose for becoming a bounty hunter and why he despises Favaro so much. So yeah, taking for granted, the two aren\u2019t exactly the best of friends or at least anyways. Still, the most important character is perhaps Amira. She may seem like a normal girl with a big appetite but her ownership of a certain key could decide the outcome of their world\u2019s future. This show explores a fantasy adventure quite different than what you may be used to. Rather than just going down a narrow-minded road of \u201csaving the world\u201d, we get a journey of old-fashioned and thrilling fun. I don\u2019t mean fun as in the characters goofing around but fun as in spectacular feel which will keep your eyes glued to the screen.\\n\\n\r\nAdventure series can come as mixed bags for its variety at first. However, Shingeki no Bahamut creates a thrill of an adventure by bending with its natural settings. It\u2019s able to keep its momentum every episode by introducing to the audience what it\u2019s trying to do, the actor and actresses of each journey along with its purpose, and most importantly have fun with it wherever it goes. Indeed, the series\u2019 setting is like a big playground with plenty to offer. From heavy guarded fortresses to the natural feelings of the sea, this series crafts fantasy in such a way that you may almost feel as if you are there. Not only that but the series offers plenty of creatures from its bestiary selection that includes dragons, zombies, and giant crabs. A more prominent species includes angels who seems to play a pivotal background role with connections to Amira. Because let\u2019s face it, we barely know anything about the girl so anything to flesh out her character is a plus. Thankfully, the series doesn\u2019t neglect any of our main characters and provides a detailed insight on some of their pasts including Kaisar and Favaro. It\u2019s always nice to feel attached to some of the characters as well and even Amira can be amusing to watch thanks to her lack of common sense.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the fun feeling of the series, the story can be dark when it needs to be. A prime example consists of the struggle between Demons and Angels. After all, the series is all about finding the God\u2019s Key, the important piece of puzzle used to unlock Bahamut. The series makes it clear through both words and scenarios that Bahamut is something like an Apocalypse. Should the source of power be unleashed would be the end of the world. With a good balance of story and character building, the show is able to focus on its plot very creatively. At the same time, I also find it fascinating how in the middle of all this, the show is still able to deal with interpersonal struggles. I\u2019m referring to the conscious thoughts of Favaro and Kaisar when the two are forced into an alliance in order to survive and recuse Amira. The funny part of their adventures is that they usually argue between themselves in the face of danger. Yet somehow, they survive almost each time not by luck or skill but because of how they are able to cooperate even if it\u2019s just momentarily. Because let\u2019s face some facts: Favaro isn\u2019t exactly a hero (he\u2019s more like an anti-hero motivated by self-interests) while Kaisar tries to play the role of an avenger (take a good guess at who he is planning to kill). Of course, Amira also plays a role with her hidden secrets. Rita too plays a supportive role alongside Kaisar. These four characters makes the bulk of the fun in this series and no episode wastes time on their potentials.\\n\\n\r\nThis show feels like a legend, something to remember by not just for the story or characters. And with legends, there are also myths and faces to remember. Perhaps a prominent character to also take notice is Jeanne D'Arc. Staying true with her name and title, she is a warrior with a deadly lance. The show disregards any sort of feminine weakness in this woman but instead portrays her as someone who vows to save the world, a bold statement that could actually hold some truth with what she offers. Against all odds, she fights powerful demons such as Azazel and proves many times that she is capable of handling herself and perhaps even become a legend to remember. Similarly, Bahamut is also considered a legend with its back-story. The key difference is that its legend can be reborn and the show apparently also has a hidden villain; one who assumingly planned to allow Amira to obtain the God\u2019s Key. The show has that notion of mystery to keep viewers at their seat.\\n\\n\r\nWith all the fun going around the show, Shingeki no Bahamut can seem a bit ridiculous at times. Some of this can be the reoccurring jokes that can seem a bit repetitive. Furthermore, there are times on occasion when the balance of the series feels a bit off. Amira can also feel like a character that viewers will find difficulty to feel attached or even taken seriously at times; just look at the scenes when she is drunk or go full on gluttonous at the sight of delicious food. Finally, another drawback perhaps for this show is some episodes tends to be a bit rushed with resolution. One particular important episode has this predictable outcome with more potential but seemingly ends abruptly. Still, these things doesn\u2019t ruin the series\u2019 fun. In fact, you might be seduced into this story so much where those minor bits are seemingly forgotten.\\n\\n\r\nMAAPA isn\u2019t exactly the most well-known studio but they should deserve recognition for this series\u2019 artwork. Not only do characters look uniquely balanced but the setting itself is engrossed with fantastic elements. Speaking of characters though, Favaro has his signature afro-like hair that is hard to not take notice. Meanwhile, there\u2019s the other supernatural entities that strikes fear and curiosity for viewers. Yet, the most impressive feature of the show truly shines during the action scenes. Marvelously crafted with strong coordination, I give high praise to the action scenarios each episode. Not only do they look good but feels real and hard to forget with its high production values. The show strives to build itself around a memorable adventure of full throttle action rather than asinine fan service. Thanks to what it has shown us, it did just that.\\n\\n\r\nWhile not as strong as the artwork, it\u2019s also hard to forget the music of this series. A good example would be both the heavy metal OP song and the emotional ED. OST also makes sense on most parts with intense beats of its coordination. Luckily, all this balances well with the character voice mannerism as well. I give praise to Favaro\u2019s VA for portraying him as a bounty hunter who always opens up paths of adventure thanks to his motivations. On the other hand, Kaisar\u2019s voice can feel monotonous while Arima is down there somewhere in the middle. In retrospect, the soundtrack is above average but nothing too special that will knock you out of the park.\\n\\n\r\nShingeki no Bahamut is an adventure theme series done right. With the way it does its info dumping, characterization, and storytelling, the series also made it like a wild roller-coaster ride. And during that ride, expect a lot of fantasy tropes that are all mixed in to celebrate the franchise. Some bits of the story could be lacking though and takes a bit of patience to get through. However, this definitely feels like an instant classic. Risky yet compelling, action packed as well as being able to articulate a story, the series proves over and over again why it can pull off its stunts. This is a must-see for any fan who wants to take a deep dive into adventure.\\n",

It starts with the fact that it contains more than one mythological belief (Gods, Evil, Dragons, Legendary Heroes...) and further more they are fused in one story, when I read the synopsis, I thought that this is another anime with cliches about gods, humans, and evil fighting and shit, but then I was so glad I watched the first episode cause the characters were so good actually and since the beginning there was major events in the story.\r\nSecond, the plot is good, I mean, combining stories already known andadding them to the main one is something not easy to do, but in this anime it's fluid and easy to understand even if you have no idea who the characters are in their real myth and if you do, well you will be amazed how the combination worked liked a charm.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the sound (Ambiance) is well worked, simple with no overdone effects and clean, and when it come to the soundtrack, well it's the EPICNESS itself... really outstanding you can't get enough from it, very passionate, so powerfully emotional, so far this soundtrack is only second to elfen lied's...\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah for me it's a 9/10 anime, I enjoyed watching it and it's worth the watch.",

            "content": "\"Which way does the wind blow? To tomorrow!\"\r\nShingeki no Bahamut is a pre-apocalyptic show about fate, destiny and what it means to change your fate, thrown into a cast of very unique characters and a power struggle between angels, humans and demons. The show is very promising from the beginning, builds up a lot of excitement in the middle, but ultimately ends in a rather anti-climactic fashion with insufficient resolution.\r\nTL;DR\r\nStory: 5/10\r\nArt: 7/10\r\nSound: 5/10\r\nCharacter: 7/10\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\r\nOverall: 6/10\r\nGood points:\r\n+ Very unique character and setting designs\r\n+ Good and varied main and supporting cast\r\n+ Exciting and interesting from the beginning\r\n+ Good plot twist towards the end, though it maybe obvious\\n\r\n+ Some good comic moments\\n\\n\r\nBad points:\\n\r\n- Very underdeveloped antagonist characters\\n\r\n- Fails to have a good resolution\\n\r\n- Anti-climactic climax at the end of the anime\\n\r\n- Many plot holes left unexplained\\n\r\n- Lack of development in supporting characters\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nI'm going to tackle this plot analysis in a slightly different manner and instead of focusing on key plot arcs, I'm going to structure this on the various plot merits. The story itself is rather simple. Two bounty hunters and childhood friends, Favaro an Kaisar are at odds with each other. By chance or fate, Favaro meets Amira, a half-demon half-angel, who has just stolen the God Key and received instructions to go to Helheim. Favaro then promises to help Amira to bring her to Helheim but himself doesn't know a thing about where Helheim is or whether it actually exists.\\n\\n\r\n1. Ingenuity / Interest\\n\\n\r\nThe story starts off with the main conflict right from the beginning. Constantly, we are being reminded that everything that the protagonists are trying to do, is to stop Bahamut's impending revival after the God Key was stolen. This same old story of imminent doom is repeated over and over again, as if the audience was too forgetful to remember how deadly Bahamut actually is. (+1 for overarching conflict)\\n\\n\r\nBahamut was in fact, so deadly, that most of the cities managed to rebuild themselves sufficiently within the next 6 months, which is much shorter than it took Haiti to recover from the 2010 earthquake, and Sri Lanka to recover from the 2004 Boxing Day Tsunami. Clearly, Bahamut does less damage in 15 minutes than natural disasters can do in mere seconds. So, not that big of a deal actually.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime did do a good job of attempting to fool the audience into thinking that Bahamut was very powerful though. There were numerous scenes throughout the anime, and in almost every episode, of the angels in heaven creating a barrier made up of tessellated hexagons, struggling to keep Bahamut's pre-awakening power in check. The angels constantly make remarks like, \"We can't keep this up... at this rate, we won't last...\" Archangel Michael even once says, \"If this is the power of Bahamut before he awakens, then how much more when he actually does?\"\\n\\n\r\nThe old \"the world is coming to an end\" overarching conflict is not an original one unfortunately, so the story gets no points for that. Also, as far as plot is concerned, I was never really very excited about seeing Bahamut in action, neither was I very concerned about whether or not he would revive in the first place - because by half of the anime and due to all the constant reminders of Bahamut's terrifying power, it was obvious that he was going to revive anyway, and then get beaten by a random hero anyway.\\n\\n\r\n2. Depth / Development\\n\\n\r\nIn this case, the story didn't offer much depth behind it at all. While Favaro's random musings about what his father said was interesting, all his talk about fate and changing your fate just sounded very cliched and fell on deaf ears. There was nothing remotely thematic about the rest of the story.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the story was so simple that they really stuck to the classic protagonist and antagonist stereotype. The main antagonist, Martinet, the ultimate manipulator's, real motives were basically to watch the world get destroyed, which is a very shallow explanation of his evil schemes. The protagonists on the other hand, simply want to do the opposite - prevent the world from getting destroyed, and nothing much else. It lacked a lot of complexity and depth in this area.\\n\\n\r\nThe only plot development came in the form of the forced suspense at finding out who the real mastermind behind Amira's stealing of the God Key was. And I say forced because they basically used the same old \"masked figure\" who goes about doing obviously evil stuff in Anatae but they intentionally don't show us his face just because they want to keep us asking who it is. But this is repeated so many times that we're no longer interested to find out, or, the more perceptive would already know that this was Lavalley. So again, very limited plot development beyond the main plot line. (+1 for a little development)\\n\\n\r\nThere was one good plot twist though, that Martinet was actually Lavalley, even if it was already hinted much earlier in the Anatae arc, when Lavalley first secretly meets Amira out of sight of everyone else, suggesting that Lavalley was actually a bad guy in disguise. Also, the anime tried not to make it too obvious, by making Lavalley fabricate a fake back story for Amira, as well as making him look like he was trying to stop Jeanne D' Arc's burning at the stake. (+1 for plot twist)\\n\\n\r\n3. Coherence / Logical Sense\\n\\n\r\nThere are a whole host of plot holes in this story, but at least the main assumptions of the story are believable - that there are 2 parts of a key that awakens Bahamut when they fuse together, and that it is prophesied that a hero would be able to stop Bahamut, that there exists angels, demons and humans and that Amira could be born of both demon and angel (+1 for believable assumptions)\\n\\n\r\nThe way the plot progressed also at least made some sense, and there were no super obvious flaws in the way the main conflict was presented and dealt with. Plot lines also progressed smoothly without any major anomalies. (+1 for making some sense)\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, there were many instances where Kaisar reacted very unbelievably and unnaturally, even given his characterization as a narrow-minded person who is greatly affected by everyone around him. From things like crying for Rita, to being over-protective of Amira, to trying to kill Favaro numerous times without even bothering to clarify what happened, to suddenly become super cooperative with Favaro.\\n\\n\r\nBonus Points: Not awarded due to 9 plot holes.\\n\\n\r\nIn episode 1, Favaro and Kaisar are pictured on horseback, jumping off a bridge and falling 15 times their own height through the air (roughly 27 metres) before the horses landed on uneven roof tile surfaces. There is no possible way that this stunt could be performed without inflicting some serious injury on both the horses and the rider, and it is definite that the horses wouldn't be able to continue galloping on top of houses either.\\n\\n\r\nIn episode 3, Kaisar cries over Rita's zombified body when she turns into a zombie after being bitten by one of her own undead units, but Kaisar literally just met Rita in this episode, and it's quite far a stretch to say that Kaisar has any feelings for the young girl at this point in time. All he really did was tell Rita about his backstory and have Rita tell him how pathetic the story sounded.\\n\\n\r\nIn episode 4, Kaisar has only just met Amira, but suddenly wants to \"protect\" and \"save\" her for no real apparent reason, other than the fact that she is a girl. Kaisar seems to have this weird inclination to protect any girl that he meets, doesn't he? Or maybe that's part of his characterization as a noble knight, but it still doesn't make sense whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nIn episode 5, Azazel claims that the New Orleans' Knights were lying in ambush for his demon ship in Sword Valley, but in the show it clearly shows most of the knights on horseback, holding their flag and emblem high in plain sight - it was clearly a direct confrontation rather than an ambush. It's not possible that Azazel's scouts only managed to catch sight of the entire army after they were attacked, since most of Sword Valley's terrain is flat and there is no terrain cover whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nIn episode 6, the three archangels, Michael, Raphael and Uriel, decide that letting the humans take care of Amira, who is currently also sought after by the demons, is a lot better than personally sending angels down to guard Amira themselves. I don't believe the angels lacked manpower since in the last episode, they clearly still had tons of reinforcements and sparing a few to look after Amira would have been a much better idea.\\n\\n\r\nIn episode 11, archangel Michael somehow realizes that the small little unnoticeable purple ball that Rita threw at Jeanne, which bounced off a flying duck, was the antidote for Jeanne's demon transformation, and decides to give up his own life to turn Jeanne back to normal. There is no way, that Michael would be noticing a small ball in an aerial combat situation between Jeanne and Bacchus, also there is absolutely no way Michael can deduce even remotely that this ball is an antidote that works on Jeanne.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 12, Favaro decides that cutting Kaisar's forearm off to fool Martinet into thinking that he was still under his control, and then using the bounty hunter tool on Kaisar's arm to capture Martinet, was a better option than having Kaisar simply use the tool himself. All Kaisar needed was just for Favaro to block Martinet's view of Kaisar for long enough for him to suddenly shoot out the wristband in Martinet's direction and say the commands. It was unnecessary drama and in Rita's words, \"Letting your arm get chopped off, that's stupid.\"\\n\\n\r\nAlso, if all Favaro did was to stab a Barb of Bahamut onto Bahamut's head, then honestly couldn't any random flying angel or demon do it? All they had to do was pass Favaro's barb to any flying ally and it was a done deal. From the angels' point of view, it seems like it was a lot more difficult trying to defend against an awakening Bahamut than an already awakened one.\\n\\n\r\nPlus, if we look back at Martinet's plan closely, we can see a key plot hole resurface at the start of the anime. If Martinet's plan was really to get Amira to steal the God Key and then have her bring it to Helheim, why did he simply leave Amira wandering around herself, trying to find a way to get to Helheim? Shouldn't Martinet have at least given Amira the other half of the pendant so that she could find her way, from the beginning, rather than have some random, unreliable bounty hunter clumsily try to help her find the way there? Martinet made pretty much no effort on his own to positively ensure that Amira would end up and find herself in Helheim, he just basically somehow believed that Favaro would magically lead her there.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the plot suffers in every department - it lacks a whole lot of depth, it isn't particularly interesting or exciting, it's poorly developed and it also suffers from a great host of plot holes. Unfortunately for this 13-episode anime, they couldn't really pull off the plot well enough.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nOP Sequence: 2/2\\n\r\nED Sequence: 0/2\\n\r\nAnimation: 2/3\\n\r\nAesthetics: 3/3\\n\\n\r\nThe OP Sequence was very well crafted and was beautiful, but I really didn't like the artistic style for the ED Sequence. On the aesthetics side, I loved the character and setting designs that this anime used - really quite unique styles - from Favaro's afro to Kaisar's weird hairstyle to Bacchus and his drunk look and Rita, the kawaii zombie girl, was really a joy to watch. The animation side suffers just slightly a little because I thought Bahamut himself was quite poorly animated and made him a lot less threatening than it could have been. He continued to seem frozen in stone because Bahamut never moved anywhere away from his original location.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nOP Sequence: 1/2\\n\r\nED Sequence: 0/2\\n\r\nBackground Music: 4/4\\n\r\nAdditional Themes: 0/2\\n\\n\r\nThe OP Sequence sounds good at first, but after awhile gets really jarring and I kept skipping it after that. The ED Sequence was basically as boring as the animation they put for it. Background music was good though, with a good mix of both eerie and action-packed music. I also liked how they used a lot of vocal orchestra in this - keeping to the Bahamut's \"ancient\" theme. No points for additional themes though, because there were none.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters are Favaro, Kaisar, Amira and Rita in that order for the protagonists, and Martinet and Beelzebub in that order for the antagonists. The rest of the cast - Bacchus, Hamsa, Jeanne, Azazel, Michael are supporting characters.\\n\\n\r\nFavaro definitely is one of the most unique characters I have ever come across. More than just having a weird afro, his constant switching between serious to playful, his style of not wanting to do more than he should, yet knowing that he will regret it, and his general ability to joke around even in the most direst of situations really make you want to love him. You can tell he also changes slightly - from going to simply being happy go lucky to actually taking responsibility for his actions and for Amira, whom he learns to really take care of, like a younger sister (+1 to uniqueness, +1 to growth) His backstory though is kind of insufficient, since we really don't know what exactly happened when his dad and the bandits attacked Kaisar's dad.\\n\\n\r\nKaisar as a character actually falls short of almost anything. He's a cliched noble knight who fails at doing everything precisely because he keeps trying to uphold these noble values without being able think straight and to make reasonable judgements about the situation. He's also fairly useless in the entire anime - his only use being to save Favaro from the demon-state of mind at the end - because besides that he does nothing but get in Favaro's way and is a complete burden to Rita, who can do much better without him. Even while protecting Amira he gets caught together with her and gets locked up in a cage where he could do nothing. Still, at the end he finally learns to put aside his differences with Favaro and managed to, as a team, defeat Martinet in an overly dramatic manner (+1 for growth). His backstory was as insufficient as Favaro's, since they basically share the same backstory, but at least his \"childhood friend\" link to Favaro shed more light into his interactions with Favaro and explains how he both wants and doesn't want to kill him (+1 for character interactions).\\n\\n\r\nAmira is also a rather interesting character, with superhuman powers of transforming into a one-winged demon and basically just brutally punching her enemies down. She's also later on revealed to be young, in fact, so young that she technically qualifies as a little kid in spite of her looks. The plot tell us that demons made her age faster using the cocoon, so that her body develops faster and is several years older than her mind. That's not a bad explanation, but it basically robs Amira of any characterization whatsoever. She becomes a complete and total pawn in this anime, used by Martinet, used by Favaro, used by everyone else essentially, and has hardly any views, opinions of her own, and merely gets told what to do. While she does have an awesome transformation ability, the fact that the anime only made her out to be childish really diminished her role in the plot.\\n\\n\r\nRita is by far my favourite character in this anime, and also one of the characters that was better developed than the rest. Rita is a young girl who turns a necromancer after discovering a book, and then uses her powers of reanimating the dead to \"play village\". Apparently she's played village for at least 15 years already and is basically getting sick of it. She eventually runs into Kaisar and Favaro and after failing to kill them, turns into a zombie and starts following Kaisar around. Her visibly nonchalant-looking character and blunt remarks are well-weaved into her \"more mature than she looks\" archetype. If Amira is the girl who looks older than her age, then Rita is the opposite, a girl who looks much younger than her age, but of course, a more mature character is a lot better for main character types. Rita manages to not only become useful in every situation using a reanimation ability - saving them from soldiers, putting up distractions - but also manages to uncover Martinet's concoction and, as a somewhat professional herbalist, manages to create an antidote that counters it. What's not to love about this adorable little child whose only goal is to save her friends? Even though she's acts rather coldly and cruelly to Kaisar, she shows that she really does care for him, even helping to bandage up the stump of an arm he has left at the end. (+1 for cute amazing character, +1 for multi-faceted nature)\\n\\n\r\nAs for the rest of the supporting cast, they were also a host of very interestingly conceptualized characters. Bacchus, the self-proclaimed god, who basically only drinks a lot and pays bounty hunters whenever they get a bounty, and his amazing duck Hamsa who is more than just a little pet, but proves to be able to fly and deflect projectiles by expanding his body. There's also Jeanne D'Arc, who is awesome sword fighter capable of wielding a huge-ass sword that can unleash such a devastating blast that it forces Azazel to retreat. Jeanne also sees some character development in the form of her righteous, unwavering nature when she was tempted to take the concoction. Unfortunately, once she turns evil in the later episodes, even after Michael's sacrifice to restore her normalcy, she ceases any further usefulness in the plot whatsoever. (+1 for interesting, varied cast) And of course, there's Azazel, who did nothing but get ambushed and took his revenge on Beelzebub. He's not very developed either.\\n\\n\r\nOn the antagonist's side, we have the one-dimensional Beelzebub who is so stupid that he doesn't even know that he can't control Bahamut even if he bestows upon it the Transcendent Key that he made. Beelzebub basically is a power-hungry monster but ends up getting, and deservedly, brutally incinerated by one of Bahamut's blasts. He's so poorly developed that I can't even consider him a character.\\n\\n\r\nMartinet is just slightly more interesting because he's the one doing all the ground work, making sure his evil schemes fall into place, manipulating an angel from long ago, the demon working with him, and various other humans including Jeanne, Favaro, Anatae's King to make his plans go smoothly. But still, not a word is said about his character or backstory, and his motives for plotting all this evil is even worse - \"I just want to watch the world get destroyed.\" Way to go, another crazy apocalyptic lunatic.\\n\\n\r\nFor characters, the anime suffers quite a bit from poor character depth and development for a lot of the cast, including main characters, and the antagonists are just so poorly developed that they were basically ignored this entire time. Still, the uniqueness of many of the characters really pulled through and made me enjoy watching the characters interact with one another.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nFor humour, the anime has done quite well. There is a lot of slapstick on the part of Favaro and Kaisar, who get into trouble plenty of times and have to have their fellow allies save them. Bacchus and Hamsa are also a pretty comic duo, because both have very peculiar sneezes. Also, Rita's monotonous and blunt remarks at all the stupid situations just make me laugh a lot more. (+2 for comedy)\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of action, the anime also doesn't fail to deliver. While there isn't a lot of actual action and fighting scenes per se, there was a decent amount of close combat fighting, sword fighting, all of which were rather well animated and was exciting enough to keep me watching. (+1 for action)\\n\\n\r\nThere were also some hints of emotion in the anime, especially at the part where Amira finally gets to meet her own mother, but in very dire circumstances. Still, she presses on stubbornly to give her a hug, and at the end says that Favaro was right that her mom would recognize her just from the hugging alone. Her kiss with Favaro was slightly unnerving though but at least it gave their relationship a good finishing touch. (+1 for emotion)\\n\\n\r\nPacing-wise, the anime was pretty exciting from the beginning, and really set the mood of being an action-comedy flick, as well as introduced our two very interesting important characters of the show. (+1 for pacing) Towards the middle though, as the story slowly progressed and we slowly started to see who was the evil mastermind behind the entire evil plot, things got a lot less interesting as things became obvious and I honestly just wanted to skip to the part where Bahamut awakens. And finally, at the end when he finally does, the resolution was just super anti-climactic, I never even go to know what happened to Rita or the other supporting characters, I only ever saw Favaro and Kaisar.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has at least earned itself 1 bonus point for not having any filler episodes (not counting the recap episode 6.5, even though it's useless).\\n\\n\r\nWhile I did enjoy most of this anime, there were honestly some parts where it did feel repetitive and got a bit too boring for my liking.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nAltogether, I thought that the plot could have seriously had more thought put into it, while the characters Kaisar and Amira really need a lot more character development as part of the main character cast. It was a fairly enjoyable watch, though I was admittedly disappointed after reading some really rave reviews about this show.",

            "content": "Shingeki no Bahamut is a series that I don't seem to love as much as others, which I will explain in detail while trying not to spoil too much.\r\nFirst of all, the music and art is great, presenting the show in a spectacular package. Even the occasional CGI monsters works for the most part, sticking out yet without looking lazy.\r\nI was drawn in by the idea of bounty-hunting and the refreshing design of our swashbuckling main character, Favaro, who brings in just the right balance of charm and goofiness. The conflicting relationships he shares with everyone around him is also an unending spring of entertainment.\\n\\n\r\nThe first episodes present an interesting concept. After bragging at a bar, Favaro unwittingly tricks a demon-girl and gets into a contract with her. Our suave rogue is now stuck with a demon far stronger than himself, who could easily destroy him with the flick of a finger if she realized he lied to her. It had great potential for some mind-games, with Favaro constantly having to lie and outsmart the demon in order to survive.\\n\\n\r\nSadly this is where the characters start to show how underdeveloped they are. The demon-girl turns out to be a na\u00efve girl, easily outsmarted by everyone, turning into a plot-device and a damsel in distress. The promise of a great character-dynamic between her and Favaro goes straight out the window. My biggest pet-peeve however is that Favaro suffers from an old shounen-trait, which is that he\u2019s too cool to care about anything. Is Favaro cool? Sure. Does having no clear motivation make him cooler? Not really. If anything it just makes him look like a third wheel when he's dragged into situations against his will. He even states out loud that he doesn't know exactly why he's doing what he's doing. He says he wants to rebel against destiny and forge his own path, yet his motto is \u201cthe wind blows to tomorrow\u201d, symbolizing just how much he's guided by wherever the wind blows him. In a nut-shell this is what made the characters a let-down for me.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is a mish-mash of ideas that I\u2019ve already seen done better. The great personification of evil that\u2019s about to be awakened after a thousand years. The bickering trio from Samurai Champloo. The literal retelling of Jeanne d\u2019Arc\u2019s legend with the added twist at the end.\\n\\n\r\nThe story has several problems, but one is far bigger than the others. Our title-character Bahamut is not even remotely involved with the main characters until the last third of the series. The angels, demons and Jean d\u2019Arc however are involved with Bahamut early on. I felt like the actual main characters were left to aimlessly wander while the main plot developed in the background.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it is a well-animated series with an underdeveloped story that never delivers on what could have been something far greater.",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**\r\nEvery now and then, an anime comes along that is so remarkably charming, entertaining, and fun that you just completely forget about the rest of its flaws. Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis, is the epitome of this kind of anime. It\u2019s 100% \u201crule of cool\u201d; a million things are going on at the same time, ridiculous amounts of insanity are crammed into short intervals of time, the characters and plot events are totally over the top, and yet all you can do is smile while watching it. SnB is undoubtedly the pleasant surprise of the season, considering that it\u2019s based on, of all things,the lore of a card game. First WIXOSS and now SnB\u2026 Huh. Maybe card games are on to something. Anyway, let\u2019s get to the review:\\n\\n\r\nSynopsis: This story follows the happenings throughout the world of Mistarcia: a magical clusterfuck where humans, gods, demons, monsters, creatures, etc all must coexist. Long ago, a tremendously powerful being, Bahamut, threatened to destroy the land, but humans, gods, and demons united to seal its power away. The key to that seal was split into two pieces; one half was given to the gods and the other to demons, so that they would never be united and Bahamut would never be released. Two thousand years later, Bahamut threatens to be awakened once more\u2026\\n\\n\r\nIf you think about it, there\u2019s really nothing remarkable about SnB\u2019s premise; I think we\u2019ve all seen the \u201can evil power sealed away for thousands of years is going to be awakened!\u201d type of thing before. What makes this show so awesome is not in its premise, but in its execution. The show thrives during its stretches where there is very little exposition at all, which is most of the time. SnB knows how to \u201cshow don\u2019t tell\u201d, and let's the plot events do the talking for them. Unfortunately, the show gets away from that winning formula during its middle stretch and begins spending way too much time on the overarching story, which creates a number of problems. As previously mentioned, the plot of this show is really nothing special; it's way too ambitious for its own good, has holes, and isn't exactly the most original. When the awesome, over-the-top action slows down, the audience begins to remember that these flaws do indeed exist, hurting the enjoyment gotten out of the anime. Luckily, it pulls itself out of its overly-plot-focussed rut relatively quickly and goes back to the fresh and energetic action you can't help but love. I really can't stress enough how nearly every episode presents us with an entirely new scenario in a totally new setting full of insanity and pure fun. For instance, have you ever wanted to see a fight consisting of zombies vs. bounty hunters vs. mermonsters vs. demons vs. a giant crab on board a pirate ship? If you aren\u2019t at least slightly amused by that idea, then you\u2019re a stick in the mud. It\u2019s HARD to not be entertained by the show\u2019s extremely well done action, comedy, and variety of settings. There may not be much depth to the plot, but this anime will make you not care.\\n\\n\r\nAs amusing as the plot may be, the real factor that makes it SnB so endearing definitely has to be the characters. They are a delight to watch every second they are on screen, ensuring that there is never a boring moment. Surprisingly, this cast doesn\u2019t just manage to be mindlessly entertaining because of their personality quirks; they are legitimately well written. Favaro, the closest thing we have to a protagonist, is hilarious, charming, has clearly defined motivations and even has a small semblance of a backstory. Amira, the female lead, is quite similar; she\u2019s charming, she\u2019s funny, she has a backstory, but she is also strong; no misogynistic stereotypes to be found here. Kaiser and Rita are marvelous additions as well, not to mention the plethora of colorful side characters. Some of the cast may be underdeveloped, but they certainly never cease to be entertaining. It has been a long, LONG time since I\u2019ve seen a cast of characters with this much personality. They make the show an absolute blast to watch and you\u2019ll definitely get attached to them.\\n\\n\r\nTo top off the intoxicating style of SnB, it\u2019s worth mentioning that the animation looks completely awesome. For one, this is actually a rare example of CGI done RIGHT in an anime; it\u2019s used sparingly and actually looks fluent when it is used. Besides that, the art style, shot composition, character/monster designs, and animation is all spot on; it makes for an immersive experience that you can\u2019t take your eyes off of. That brings us to the music, which is just as fun and over the top as the rest of the show. The OP gives you a pretty good idea of what you\u2019re getting into and the OST never fails to set the \u201cFuck yeah!\u201d kind of mood that the show is so good at eliciting. SnB wouldn\u2019t be the same without it\u2019s stellar and stylized presentation.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, this anime is likely the most pleasant surprise of the entire year. It ranks right up there with the other best \"rule of cool\" shows as an awesomely entertaining, funny, action packed adventure with endearing characters and a kick-ass presentation. It doesn\u2019t have a whole lot of depth to it and it\u2019s not exactly going to blow you away, but it\u2019s hard to argue against the fact that this anime is fun as hell to watch. If this kind of show is your thing, I recommend it!",

            "content": "Another anime that prove MAPPA\u2019s technical capability, after the success of Zankyou no Terror. We received another amazing anime. So let\u2019s start.\r\nBahamut starts with the most enthralling beginning that makes us all excited. We get the usual adventure-slash-fantasy vibe executed in the best way possible. But the problem is, as we get closer to the midway of the show, the mood of the show toned down. I now realized that Bahamut is becoming more boring and dull. It is losing its charm. It becomes less entertaining. For the reason, that Bahamut is not even \u201ctrying\u201d. It is not that ambitious of a work to becomemore entertaining. That is why in the end, it almost became a generic fantasy adventure anime. \\n\\n\r\nBahamut has a cast of a usual fantasy anime but the good thing here was that their characters are well written. We have the awesome Favaro, a goofy bounty hunter with an afro and Kaisar, the gallant bounty hunter/knight. Let\u2019s not forget the childish Amira and her seemingly counterpart which is the grumpy (and badass) Rita. These character might be bound to some overused character tropes but, like I said, that doesn\u2019t matter. They did the role they were supposed to do and that is good.\\n\\n\r\nConsidering MAPPA is from Madhouse, it is not surprising that the animation is beautiful. But it is not only that, Bahamut\u2019s charm is its camera use. The camera is comparable to those of Hollywood fantasy blockbusters. It is like Pirates of the Caribbean in a way! The movement is full of fluidity with well-choreographed fights. The sound is not that bad either, the OP and ED are amazing and the VAs did a OMEGA GOOD JOB!\\n\\n\r\nBahamut, although I said that it was going downhill in the second half, is far from disappointment. It is good in its own ways but really needs to work on the narrative. Anyways, this show is solid, fun, and enjoyable. 7/10",

            "content": "Rage of Bahamut started off feeling like it would be this really epic but lighthearted swashbuckling adventure in a pretty cool fantasy world...but then from about half way through, it tries (and fails imo) to be serious. It loses a bit of its cool, its charm, and fun. \r\nThe main character Favaro is essentially a younger, more energetic version of Jack Sparrow- except he's a bounty hunter, not a pirate. He's cool, witty, pretty skilled in combat, and especially good at escaping just about any bad situation. But the rest of the characters are okay at best- Amira's fluffy, childish personality could be quite charming,but the animation doesn't really fit that personality. Kaisar is a bit boring. And Rita, the zombie-raising witch, is pretty cool-kind of (slightly) reminds me of Toph from Avatar, but imo she doesn't get enough time to be as cool as she could be.\\n\\n\r\nBut the problem is that the characters and the setting and the music, and especially the first few episodes, make it feel like this is going to be an adventure. Amira's goal is to get to Helheim, and she hopes that Favaro will take her there, since she's convinced that he knows how to get there (and of course, he doesn't). That gave the impression, at least to me, like they would be going to different towns on a quest to get to Helheim, with Favaro getting into and out of trouble everywhere they go, with Kaisar following them and trying to catch Favaro.\\n\\n\r\nBut then demons and dragons and a war from long ago comes up and it turns into a generic action adventure where the 'chosen hero', Favaro has to save the world...and tbh, I would have rather not had that. Of course, it's more fun and charming than most animes with this type of story- mostly due to Favaro himself, as well as the music and setting that give it a more adventurous tone. But I don't like the direction it went, especially since they end up staying in one city for the slower second half. But if I had to give some credit to the second half....(spoiler alert for the very bottom of this review)\\n\\n\r\nBut I must say, the show does leave on a note that gives me hope that if they ever make a second season, that we might actually get that adventure that I craved in the first half.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nAGAIN, SPOILERS AHEAD!!! \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nNormally in a show,movie, etc.  like this, they'll make Amira turn evil, and then everyone keeps telling the main hero that there's nothing he can do but to kill her, but at the last moment the hero manages to save everyone AND keep her alive. While I do sometimes like that not everyone has to die, there are few shows that I've seen that can do it in a way that doesn't feel too forced, out of the blue, and same-old same-old. \\n\\n\r\nBut in Bahamut, Favaro actually does sacrifice Amira (or at least it seems that way) to save the world. I must say I'm impressed by the fact that it broke that cliche. It actually was a pretty sad scene.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Here are the three things that made this anime so wonderful:\r\n1) It created the sense that the world was expansive and filled with mystery and potential adventure, which is something that many other anime have tried to do and failed miserably at.\r\n2) The characters (for the most part) weren't cutouts of what is so easy to find in anime.  The main character, Favaro, was intelligent and adroit, but he wasn't without his faults.  He wasn't just some guy that was fighting for peace for no other reason than peace.  He has more depth than that, he can be selfish and cold, aswell as kindhearted.  Another main character, Kaisar, is constantly trying to get back at Favaro for stripping his family of their social status.  Although he does fit into the role of the always chivalrous character, he at least has a nice dynamic with Favaro.  Amira, the female lead, was well fleshed out.  She has a very childish personality, and it shows at every possible opportunity.  This is a very good personality for her, and it is explained why later in the series (I don't want to have any spoilers, so I won't say why).\\n\\n\r\nand 3) The animation.  It is really well done for the most part.  The character all have their own unique designs (no need to have to differentiate characters only by their hair color like in SOME anime).  The animation is fluid and the chaos and fighting in the show is where the animation really stand out in fluidity and overall beauty.  The only problems that I found with the animation was the monster, Bahamut.  Although he seemed epic and powerful, he just seemed somehow out of place, as if his design and animations didn't match the rest of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot seemed to be nothing special at first, but the way that it was presented was what sets it a league apart from the competition.  Favaro gets in contact with a wandering, magical girl, Amira, because of his lie of knowing how to get to a place called Helheim.  She really wants to go their and he gets stuck in a contract in which he must take her there.  Eventually they are caught up in an epic battle to save humans, angels, and demons alike.  There adventures lead them through a vast world where they meet all types of magical beings, from g-ds to zombies and everything in between.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening was slightly better than average.  Although the visuals were nice and fit the show well, the song had too much screaming in it.  Although some may like that kind of music, it isn't my cup of tea.  The ending is a different story.  The music was beautifully done and it was calming.  It was animated in a unique style that was stunning and it fit in perfectly with the music.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the anime was done beautifully and was well paced.  There was never a dull moment; it was always filled with important plot events that were exciting.  A must watch for anyone that likes anything dark, adventurous, or is just looking for something else to watch that they will love.  It gets a high recommendation!",

It's a little rushed at times with everything being shoved into 12 episodes, but I think it handles itself fairly well despite that.\r\nI won't say more since I don't want to spoil anything, but I highly recommend checking this one out!",

            "content": "Please be warned that this review may contain stuff that by some may be considered as spoilers even though no specific scenes of events of the show are described.\r\nAs far as the story goes, this anime has just another anti hero wannabe guided by fate and poorly developed emotions to save the girl and the world plot. It has no innovations whatsoever and in it's short 12 episodes it develops, in my opinion, even that poorly.\r\nThe main character is way outclassed by the world and the happenings around him, never really displaying either the physical strength or the strength of character one would expect amain character to have so that he may deal with the problems at hand. That being said i feel that his emotions and way of thinking are not developed enough on screen for us to see some actual change that would lead him from being just an average bounty hunting rogue to a man who would give his life for a girl or an even higher purpose at that. All in all i consider him to be one of the most boring, weak and underdeveloped main characters i've ever seen in an anime.\\n\r\nThe girl of this story is even less developed, being a crybaby of epic proportions. She is unable to do anything or resist anything when it really counts even though she is considerably strong normally. As a matter of fact she is a lot stronger than the hero so the whole giving in thing just creates the sensation that it is done on purpose so that the story can move on and so that she needs rescuing when she normally could have just ended most problems very easily on her own.\\n\r\nThe \"team\" has 2 more characters one of which is the former knight (also very weak) who doesn't actually do anything other that waste dialogue time from the start till the end of the show and a zombie girl who is the most interesting concept of a character in this show but we actually get to see too little of her.\\n\r\nThe rest of the side characters have virtually no development and are just casually thrown in here and there so that the story may advance with the exception of Jean who gets a few more minutes of screen time. She is the only human capable of actually doing anything but ultimately gets shut down in a runabout way which also gives the sensation that it is done so that the main character may get the chance to step up and be the hero himself.\\n\r\nThis leads us to the main problem of the show which is the bad guys. Personally I am one of those twisted guys that enjoy a good villain more than a good hero most of the time because he can spice things up and admittedly a hero's greatness can most times be measured by the greatness of his nemesis. I wasn't expecting to find an \"Uchiha Madara\" in this show but come on. It felt like the villain here didn't have any kind of end game other than the \"watch the world burn\" scenario and we are not even shown why or how he got there.It is not even clear weather he is a demon or a human and how it is exactly that he does what he does. Everything about him is shrouded in vagueness and he is taken down ridiculously easy, easier in fact than most of his so called pawns.\\n\r\nAs far as the art goes its is the only feature that i find pretty good as it kind of combines western concepts of knights, armors, castles and so forth with purely anime based concepts of angels, demons and spells. The sound effects and music are also, to say the least, enjoyable.",

To keep him away of the world gods and demons have a seal they keep in their worlds.\r\nOne day a girl call Amira who only knows she has to find her mother on a land called Helheim arrives to Earth, she brings a amulet which is damaged and she can\u2019t go there, but one night in a tavern she hears a bounty hunter called Favaro saying he\u2019s going to Helheim and he knows an short cut. Amira proposes Favaro a deal who acceptsto take her to Helheim, but to make sure he keeps part of the deal she puts him a demon tale, it can only disappear once they get to their destination.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime must be one of the best of 2014, it\u2019s full of moments of plenty of action and made with imagination, we can see bounty hunters, knights, living dead and even the historic character of Joan of Arc. The animation it\u2019s very well done and the design of the landscapes and characters show several hours of work. On the other hand I think the story it a bit dense by having so many characters participating on it, and there are things they could have changed like the moment Favaro rips off Kaisar\u2019s left arm.\\n\\n\r\nFor me there are three characters that are very bored like Hamsa, the duck accompanying Bacchus, he barely makes something in the serie. Bacchus spends most of the inside a wagon and drinking. And Kaisar Lidfort, a knight who belonged to an important family and blames Favaro of all his disgraces, his emotive nature can be irritating.\\n\\n\r\nFew are the animes that attracted me or I haven\u2019t finished watching but this one was worth watch it until the end. \\n",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nOne of history's defining features is the men and women who were willing to take a chance. Concepts such as traversing the Atlantic for colonization, migrating across the western half of North America, or scouting Europe for a new trade route sound fantastical. During the \"Age of Discovery,\" embarking on an adventure was the norm, with riches and prospects the rewards. Nowadays, an \"adventure\" usually consists of driving the car to the local toy store. But suppose an opportunity presented itself. Would you shy away from what lie before you, or would you follow your destiny? As Shingekino Bahamut: Genesis shows, \"it's not the destination that matters, but the journey.\"\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nBahamut begins with the stoic Kaisar chasing after the carefree Favaro. One night, Favaro accidentally makes a deal with a woman named Amira. And from there, the story truly kicks off.\\n\\n\r\nSomething that Bahamut executes extremely well is in creating the atmosphere. Medieval towns, magical powers, bounty hunting, angels and demons, dragons, zombies, pirates, massive creatures, war; there is so much attached to the world, and it definitely comes off this way. It simply feels like an adventure. Watching Amira and Favaro dance in a pub or Kaisar and Rita crashing a boat generate an overall mood that is nothing short of wondrous. Dabbling into so many different areas may cause an anime to spread itself thin, but Bahamut's ability to handle any sort of fictional event that it creates gives it another edge. Examples such as a fog-filled town or dealing with the kidnap of a friend give the characters the scenarios to be themselves, have the plot progress, and allow the action to unfold. It's constant and clever situations the whole way through, making it never a dull moment.\\n\\n\r\nBahamut takes a small misstep when it transitions away from the action and the setting. And that is in the development of its characters. It diverts many resources into making the mood feel perfect at all times (and it does this job wonderfully), but it causes the cast to fall on the wayside. Much of the character development is done through intermittent flashbacks that give just enough information at the time to craft an idea behind how the characters came to be. And this is done for the big three -- Favaro, Kaisar, and Amira. Especially so in Amira's case; the reveals about her origin, and who she truly is, is done rather hastily, conflicting with the delicate and fine world-building that surrounds her. As the plot progresses, the characters subsequently settle issues among one another, but the only person who seems to change his core beliefs is Favaro. Given how unique the cast is, it's a shame that such a blunder was encountered.\\n\\n\r\nDespite being all about adventure, Bahamut does instill a thematic presence. And it's present from the very beginning until the very end. And this is the idea that nothing can be done alone. Hearkening back to my small preview, there existed ordinary men and women who did extraordinary things. Abraham Lincoln uniting the North and the South, or Marie Curie winning Nobel Prizes comes to mind. While individually their achievements are phenomenal, they couldn't have done it alone. That is, not without the help of those around them. The same can be said for Favaro and the gang. As much as he or Jeanne de Arc wish to fulfill their tasks by themselves, it's just not possible. Furthermore, it doesn't matter who. Whether it is a close rival giving one the motivation to push onward or two conflicting sides making amends to thwart a third evil, events in life are never tackled alone. There is always someone there to bring the support, and Bahamut demonstrates this beautifully.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nBahamut pulls out all the stops when it comes to art and animation.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style also contributes to the feeling of adventure that permeates the show. Mountainous backdrops, glistening forests, Gothic cities, and hazy torture chambers are a small sampling of the varying environments offered. Everything is packed with detail, of both the 2D and 3D variety. The show utilizes expert lighting and camera work, providing the show with an overall pretty shine.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are also varied and unique. Favaro's orange afro and scar, Kaisar's regal outfit, Amira's witch and commoner attire, and Rita's tiny hat with skull-based umbrella make the characters standout not only within their own show but among other anime titles. Their faces forego traditional trends of big eyes and flat faces, instead opting for a more mature, human look. This adds a sense of \"realism\" to the characters that makes them fit their roles and actions more believably.\\n\\n\r\nAs for actual animation, it is quite stellar. Characters move fluidly, and their expressions are not only visible but movable. The fight scenes incorporate nice choreography, giving the show even more reasons to tout its adventurous trait. From nuclear explosions to flying zombie arms, anything and everything is given a high amount of animation and detail, making all that is contained within rather energetic and alive.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nFor Bahamut, its characters are a rather interesting assortment of people.\\n\\n\r\nThe last to be added to the troupe, Rita is described as being an undead-necromancer-\"loli\" zombie. Hundreds of years old yet the height of a child, she hardly ever lets her emotions get the best of her. Having spent much time essentially alone, she finds solace in the fact that Kaisar and the rest bring her into the group. Wielding deathly powers and alchemical magic, Rita is the resident plot mover, giving Favaro and the gang the chances needed to escape or otherwise cheat death -- much like she's done herself. With a ton of wisdom and a strange amount of caring for her new friends, if the four of them were a family, she'd be the doting grandmother, watching from a distance but always ready to help.\\n\\n\r\nAs a one-winged fallen demon, Amira is a complex creature. Her childlike attitude, constant hunger, and gullibility make her out to be more kid than young woman. Willing to move forward as opposed to resting on her laurels, she accepts the help of Favaro and the others to bring about her dream of meeting her mother once more in the land of Helheim. Rather resilient and immensely powerful in combat, she is no pushover when it comes to taking on the people standing in her way. Following the family idea once more, she would easily be the grandchild, upon which the others must constantly watch over.\\n\\n\r\nKaisar is a knight of proud descent. Chivalrous, strong, and handsome, he personifies what it means to be a ladies' man. His feud with Favaro forces him to follow his flippant foe. And as he does, he encounters Amira, the lady he wants to protect, and Rita, the woman he is constantly chided by. Willing to do what is right regardless of what it means for his own safety, Kaisar's determination to see events through to their end propels him from everyday soldier to incredible commander. His role is easily that of the mother.\\n\\n\r\nThe fan-favorite (and mine, too) falls to Favaro. Rather crass and unruly, he prefers to have fun at all times, before, during, and after fighting. He starts the tale without a tail and without direction, not fully realizing the gravity of the situation he has found himself in. Overtime, he learns from the others what it means to be a better person. From Rita, he gains the confidence to be the kind of man he should have always been. From Kaisar, he sees what willful and prideful drive can accomplish. And from Amira, he learns that being selfish doesn't bring about change, but compassion for others that does. By the adventure's end, Favaro transitions from a narrow-minded buffoon to a legendary hero. Asking himself, \"Which way does the wind blow,\" he easily represents the father for the four.\\n\\n\r\nThe interpretation of the main cast acting as a singular family -- Rita the grandmother, Amira the child, Kaisar the mother, and Favaro the father -- isn't a large extrapolation. Not only do their characterizations and developments paint them as such, but the core theme tying them all together does as well. This theme is, of course, the idea that family is more than just a relationship. Each of them does what they do and becomes who they are because of their family. Rita's first life was based on the love she had for her parents, and her second life was caused by it, too. Amira's sole purpose, her only reason for living is seeking out the one woman with whom she has the deepest of connections: her mother. Kaisar is motivated by the wrongdoings against his own father and besmirching of his family name. And Favaro saw what became of his own father, and therefore pushed away the ideals given to him; but eventually he took to heart the kind of person his old man had always embodied. Before anything else, family comes first. Friends come and go, work buddies are made and lost, and strangers are passed. But family is always there, both within and around everyone.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is one word: amazing. The hard guitar, tough drums, and coarse singing make it an adrenaline rush on every listen. The first half is epic and the second half is hopeful. It goes down as one of the top OPs of the year.\\n\\n\r\nThe ED completely contrasts the OP. It's soft, calming, and beautiful. The piano and violins give it a pretty arrangement, and the vocalist has an incredible range.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is filled with orchestral pieces and choir singing during the tensest of moments, and Spanish-like heroic tunes during the more triumphant ones. They further add onto the adventure-like quality of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nVoice-acting sees above average work with most of the cast. A stand-out performance is had by Hiroyuki Yoshino as Favaro, perfectly capturing the fun-loving, crossbow-wielding bounty hunter.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nIt's fascinating where this one started. When it was first announced, it was written off as nothing more than a silly card-game adaptation. But after the first episode, it truly became something more. It began proving what such out-of-left-field ideas can do. Crazy set-pieces, unique characters, and mythological happenings all in one place, and all done well, make it its own, rather rewarding product.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is actually quite funny at times, but the action and flashiness of it all makes it worthwhile. Watching a fast-paced duel between Favaro and Kaisar or seeing angels erect barriers to prevent a disaster provided many opportunities to just sit back and say, \"Now that is cool.\"\\n\\n\r\nAs my final anime of Fall 2014, Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis goes out with a bang. Its adventure-filled story, familial characters, stunning animation, and killer music make it more than just a show based on a card game.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Good, perfect adventure, misguided character development, solid theme\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Great, beautiful art, unique character designs, above average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, Rita, Amira, Kaisar, and Favaro are strongly tied to family\\n\\n\r\nSound: Great, great OP, good ED, good soundtrack, above average VA work\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Great, funny, eye-catching, and completely out of nowhere\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 9/10",

            "content": "It's always rather interesting to see what sort of direction a new animation studio takes. Being fresh onto the anime landscape gives you a ton of options to choose from. Will you take the easy path of cute girls and slice of life, or will it be the hard road of heavy action and grandly designed set pieces? As of now, after the three main titles from our latest studio to be born, I'm very happy to say that Studio MAPPA has chosen to take the high road, and the possibilities for their future areonly looking brighter every day. So, what sort of work has this budding studio produced lately?\\n\\n\r\n          On the surface, the story seems like a fairly generic setup for a high fantasy adventure, and that's because it is, but there's so much diversity and life brought into this world that it has definitely become a standout setting amongst a backlog of complex high fantasies and Lord of the Rings imitations. There are so many different aspects to this world that are mentioned as either key plot points or just passing glances, and it really helps to create a deep and vibrant world for the characters to interact in. All of this came together to create what I felt was one of the strongest starts to an anime this season.\\n\\n\r\n          That being said, the story itself still feels a bit generic sometimes and ended up being a bit more predictable than I would have liked. Some moments definitely felt like they were starting to check their high fantasy storytelling guidelines a bit too much. There were also quite a few moments where there was actually too much going on and it was a bit hard to focus on the relevant details, and a lot of them ended up getting lost in the shuffle of back and forth tradeoffs of mythological terminology. However, I did find that I was able to overlook a lot of that because this series truly becomes a spectacle to watch. Sure there's a ton of complicated back story going on somewhere, but a good deal of the series is focused solely on its spectacle of epic chases and grandly orchestrated battles.\\n\\n\r\n          The main group of characters, while fairly standard at first, do become endearing enough for me to actually care about. Favaro is our slacker-funnyman bounty hunter charged with escorting Amira to Helheim, and he also seems to take the usual path of being reluctant at first and then gradually warming up to her, but he's such an energetic and colorful character that his generic nature hardly ever shows up. Amira also manages to transcend the quest item/damsel in distress role and actually turns out to be an incredibly powerful fighter, though this is more so due to the fact that she's actually a demon. Kaiser also stands out as our typical white knight character with a grudge against Favaro, but the emotional torment that he goes through on this journey still makes him incredibly likable and endearing.\\n\\n\r\n          However, the minor characters end up being a bit weak by comparison, though that's mostly due to the fact that there are so many of them, with most of them being deities of some sort with either a heavenly or demonic leaning. While some do exist as characters in their own rights, most of them are there simply to advance the plot and are swiftly dropped from the story when they no longer become relevant. Furthermore, I'm not really sure how the Japanese view western mythology and biblical characters, but to have three completely separate characters named Beelzebub, Lucifer, and Satan was extremely confusing for a good portion of the series.\\n\\n\r\n          As previously mentioned, the animation was produced by Studio MAPPA (Terror in Resonance, Garo the Animation), and as a spectacle of gigantic set pieces and grandly orchestrated battles, this anime was an incredible sight to behold. Everything about this series felt immense in size and really helped to push the hype for the series forward. The character designs were also incredibly detailed and original, adding a much needed refresher to the usual fantasy character tropes. However, I do have to point out that there is a massive amount of CG in this series, and a lot of it didn't look as good as it could have been. It's understandable that the scope of this series is so massive that you have to save time and render certain objects in CG, but there were still some moments where it just looked really bad. As for Bahamut himself, I found myself feeling a little bit disappointed. Yes, he certainly felt very threatening, but again, the CG work wasn't all that it could have been, though thankfully it did not give me any flashbacks to the original Fate/Stay Night.\\n\\n\r\n          There is currently no dub for this series, though a FUNimation dub in the distant future isn't out of the question.\\n\\n\r\n          The soundtrack was composed by Yoshihiro Ike (Ergo Proxy, Karas), and this is definitely one of the most massive-sounding soundtracks I've heard this season. Huge, bombastic orchestration combined with grandiose choirs and pounding percussion drummed up a huge level of excitement for each battle, but there were also quite a few more adventurous themes, particularly the music associated with Favaro, which actually had a bit of a bullfighter flair to it. The opening theme \"EXiSTENCE\" by SiM blasts into each episode with a massively metal \"Engrish\" track, while the ending theme \"Promised Land\" by Risa Shimizu (VA for Amira) plays us out with a rolling ballad.\\n\\n\r\n          Overall, while the spectacle aspects of Rage of Bahamut were incredibly exciting, a good portion of the story and characters were rather difficult to follow, and the massive amount of unrefined CG took away from a few of the bigger moments.",

            "content": "Shingeki No Bahamut: Genesis/ Rage of Bahamut: Genesis Spoiler Free Review\r\nFirst I would like to state that prior to watching this series I had no idea that it was intended to be a promotional series for a mobile card game, however, taking that into account it only adds to my appreciation for the series.\r\nI will sometimes just abbreviate the series as SBG to keep things simple, and I will be breaking down this review into a few components: Story, Art/Animation, Sound, Character and overall feelings. \r\nSBG is a series I had high hopes for and was waiting in anticipation to finish. I took up theseries immediately as the last episode was uploaded to Hulu Plus and I enjoyed finishing it in just two nights. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10 Now SBG does not have a totally original or brand new concept for a story. I wont break down and run you through the whole thing as I would like people to watch it and enjoy for themselves, but here is some of my thoughts. To be quite honest, SBG is a typical story seen done many times throughout anime history. Despite this, how well it is executed and the great cast of lead and supporting characters is what makes it into an epic and fun watch. There is a great blend of enough comedy, action, adventure, and fantasy to make SBG into something epic. Although it starts off very episodic meaning that each episode was a different venture or such, when the series hits about episode 6 it takes on a main arc if you will. This arc takes on a more serious tone however it still manages to implement just the right amount of humor to keep things fresh. The ending is not a massive cliffhanger leaving you begging for more and all in all the story is just very well executed.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 10/10 Art and animation is where SBG truly excels. I remember seeing the trailer for this series back in the spring of 2014, and it immediately gripped my attention with its seemingly smooth CG animation and vibrant colors. Now being able to watch it all the way through all I can say is WOW. The world that was created for SBG is truly a work of artistic masterpiece IMO. It was amazing to see shades and hues of colors that are rarely used in anime. The color pallet is truly very broad and the studio utilized tons of colors. A perfect example of this is in an episode that has our main protagonists taking a dip in a lake. As they look off into the distance they see a beautiful sky filled with 6 different shades of lavenders and purples that all work together in beautiful fashion. I just found it very refreshing to see such a broad range of colors being used instead of being presented with a typical landscape or such. Character models are very unique with one exception. In all honesty one of the main protagonists, Kaisar is really just a Space Dandy clone LOL. But other than him, character models are very well done. The main protagonist Favaro, is very unique and not what you would expect from a lead and the models for all the various demons and Gods were very well done. Lastly we have the fight animation. Whenever I know CG is present in a series I become very skeptical, as it either works and I love it or the contrary. Luckily SBG did a great job of seamlessly integrating the CG models with the traditional style. The CG is very smooth flowing and does not move awkwardly like sometimes seen in other series. The fights in SBG are very smooth and lack any sense of \"lazy animation\" ie things such as constant flashes and pings. SBG nailed the animation aspect.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10 There is one thing that is most memorable about SBG's sound and that has to be the opening track. Now this is very very very subjective (as is this whole thing as it is a review LOL but you get me) but i gotta say the opening track is just pure badass and adds an intense feel to the cool opening animation. Other than that however, SBG does not have an overwhelmingly great soundtrack. It is filled with orchestral notes and symphonies and is mostly only head during a fight scene or such. These sounds are not the most memorable but they do a solid job of adding the needed ambiance and feel to certain scenes. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9.5/10 SBG has three main characters and a great cast of supports. I will discuss the three leads individually and the supports as a whole. First off we have Favaro, the selfish and funny yet loving bounty hunter. Favaro is a great lead as he is not what you would typically expect from an adventure/fantasy series. He is VERY selfish and really only wants to look out for his own good but for some reason he is always very likable due to his great sense of humor and comedic actions. He develops into a very strong lead with a strong will and determination and he is easily one of the most different leads i have seen in a while. Next we have the mysterious girl Amira. Amira is an uber powerful girl who despite her power, is very child like. She seems to be blind to the world and like a child, only focuses on what she truly desires. She learns a ton from Favaro and their companions through their trials and despite her sense of babyness, she never becomes annoying. I never thought to myself \"WHY IS SHE ALIVE OR WHY CANT SHE JUST DIE?!??\" as I do with many other characters of her archetype. She adds to the humor and comedy of the story but still manages to maintain her sense of badassery as she is truly a powerful character in literal terms. Next up the Space Dandy clone Kaisar who is the exact opposite of our other lead Favaro. Kaisar maintains a constant sense of seriousness and pride throughout the series and his comedic actions incidentally come from being constantly duped by Favaro. Kaisar is still a great character however, and is very likable due to his sense of justice and willingness to do the right thing. Now the support characters, who I feel complete the show. There are many supports on all three sides meaning the humans, demons, and gods. All of the supports are very unique and add more to the series rather than being stereotypical bystanders. One support in particular, Rita became a personal favorite of mine and she adds a ton of comedy through her stoic conversations and by always putting down Favaro's stupid actions. Overall SBG has a great cast of characters that dont see too drastic of a development as the series is only 12 episodes long, but they are a very likable cast and they never really seem to fit stereotypical archetypes that we normally see.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Thoughts: Overall I am rating this series a solid 9.5 as I truly did enjoy it a ton. I was surprised by this series and found it to be a truly wonderful experience. I did not think going into watching this that i would fall in love with the cast, the art, and the world that as created. I feel this is an underrated series and I dont believe that its connections to a game should bog down its rating or anyones feelings about it. If you are looking for a fun and epic adventure filled to the brim with action, Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis will not disappoint. Thank you for reading and i really hope you found my review helpful.",

            "content": "A fun, action fantasy adventure with gorgeous visuals and a charming cast.\r\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\r\nRage of Bahamut isn\u2019t the most amazing or original show out there, but it\u2019s without a doubt thoroughly enjoyable. It doesn\u2019t try to be deep or complex. It has a Pirates of the Caribbean feel of fun and adventure. It\u2019s a story about a bounty hunter helping a girl get to her destination, but they get swept up in the bigger picture involving humans, angels, demons, and a world destroying dragon.\r\nThe first thing you\u2019ll notice about Bahamut is it\u2019s a very good looking show. The fantasy setting is a breath of fresh air fromseeing yet another high school classroom. The fantasy elements aren\u2019t trying to re-invent the wheel. You\u2019ve got swords, giant crabs, necromancy, and hot demon chicks. The quality animation keeps every episode and scene a treat to look at.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are refreshing, too. The main character isn\u2019t a generic pretty boy with bangs or impossible spikes. He\u2019s got a red afro, he\u2019s tan\u2014even his personality is fun from the usual apathetic or wimpy or try-hard main characters. Everyone is drawn much more to proportion which is also refreshing from the usual moe baby features and bug eyes.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast is kept small. You\u2019ve got your care-free main character who\u2019s just looking out for himself so he\u2019s got questionable morals. He has a righteous knight after him for revenge, but they have great buddy chemistry. There\u2019s a na\u00efve demon girl trying to find her mother, and even a little zombie girl with a \u201cdeadpan\u201d look on her face that injects some pragmatism in the their plans.\\n\\n\r\nThe story starts off lightheartedly to reel you in while the visuals and setting keeps you hooked, but it escalates until they\u2019re on the verge of bringing back a 2,000 year old apocalypse. Some might regret that it loses its initial charm, but the characters keep you invested even if the story becomes a generic \u201csave the world.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t have any gripes. At best you could say the fantasy story isn\u2019t original, but even that is an un-original, almost dishonest complaint against anything. Everything\u2019s been done so you can only put new twists on it. Bahamut is easily one of 2014\u2019s best shows, and shouldn\u2019t be missed.\\n\\n",

            "content": "It appears that every fucking anime has to have some correlation to school, you've got zombies at school with tits, demons at school with tits, and Angels at school with tits.  What happens though if I were to cleverly combine all of said supernatural creatures into a fantasy world setting, dispose of all the high schools and tits, and supply some entertaining pieces?  Well you've got the anime I shall be reviewing today, Shingeki no Bahamut: Neon Genesis!  Let's have an adventure shall we.  Adventure is out there! *shows UP*\r\nShingeki no Bahamut is produced by studio MAPPA, who produced a personalfavorite anime Kids on the Slope, and the anime that literally blew itself to pieces right when the MILF was introduced, Zankyou no Terror.  It is a fantasy anime which aired in the Fall season of 2014 consisting of 12 episodes licensed by Funimation.  So, in my thoughts is Shingeki no Bahamut good?  I'd say it's pretty decent if you ask me, and I shall elaborate my points so let's initiate with the story.\\n\\n\r\nTHE STORY\\n\r\nIn the vast land of Mistarcia filled with mystical creatures, humans, demons and gods at one point in history sealed and froze a fearsome Dragon by the name of Bahamut.  Afterwards, the angels and demons were both bestowed one key that was split into 2 that maintains Bahamut in its frozen state thus sealing its power.  Flashforward 2,000 years later we follow our main protagonist Favaro, a scheming bounty hunter who likes women, money and booze encounters a female by the name of Amira, who turns out to be a demon who has an objective to reach the land of Helheim just to see her mother.  Now, Favaro must embark on a quest with Amira to journey to Helheim, but the road may not be as simple as he initially thinks.  Is Amira hiding something?  Are the demons plotting something?  What is really at Helheim?  How far will Favaro go?\\n\\n\r\nFirstly I must state that Bahamut does a fine job at establishing its world.  It establishes that there are 3 worlds, one with gods humans and demons, and we are shown a vast world out there with city areas, a kingdom, forests, and much more.  But as great as the foundation for the world is, not much is sadly explored, the world can only be seen at face value with not much content packed into their environments, I would have loved to see more of the god and demon world but sadly we didn\u2019t get much.  \\n\\n\r\nI believe where most of the problems lie is within the pacing of Bahamut which was more inconsistent than the sizes of penises at a male strip bar.  Sometimes the plot jumps from place to place unnaturally without any knowledge or explanation on how characters got to where they are, it almost feels like you\u2019re playing call of duty and the enemy lags right in front of you, there is that missing gap between point A and B that due to rushed pacing isnt filled and is just left as null and void.\\n\\n\r\nBut you know what, when Bahamut wants to be cool, it\u2019s cooler than a Harlem apartment in winter.  The action set pieces are exceptionally satisfying with slick choreography and some pretty genius tactics that left me each time feeling like a delighted customer.  There seems to be a pattern nowadays with some shows having pointless skirmishes that in the end result meant absolutely nothing but thankfully in Bahamut almost all of the fights have something at stake, whether it be for justified revenge or even the fate of the world, there is something a character can lose.  \\n\\n\r\nThis is widely thanks to just the pure energy the show has to offer.  All the characters, mostly my n*gga Favaro all bring this sort of high octane energy to the show allowing for not only the action scenes but simple scenes like dancing at the bar and even just down to the dialogue to be hella fun.  The dialogue is witty with character interactions being believable and at points more hilarious the fact I\u2019ve never had a girlfriend.  \\n\r\nShingeki no Bahamut follows the TV trope rule of cool which I shall flash the definition for onscreen, and by doing this some implausibility can be excused, but then again this doesn't cover up plot holes that the series had.  Also the characters act way too over dramatic for people they just met creating some sense of unbelievability within the characters.  \\n\\n\r\nJust as some side notes, I love how they incorporated figures like Jean d\u2019arc in its fantasy setting, that was pretty legit.  The lack of any fan service was a personal plus for me and the tone managed to maintain a serious tone when serious and a comedic tone when comedic never breaking the tone and keeping its consistency intact.\\n\\n\r\nTo finish off with the story section I want to discuss the ending which in my mind was decent but could have been handled sooooooo much better.  To be honest it felt inconclusive in lots of ways with loose ends still needing to be tied, and felt anticlimactic if you ask me.  I\u2019m about to spoil something right now so cover your ears before you get spoiled.\\n\\n\r\nOkay so one huge reason why I did not really favor the conclusion is because of how much of a disappointment Bahamut was after he was revived.  Throughout the anime we are constantly reminded on the destructive power of Bahamut yet in the very end Bahamut was taken down easy.  It's like playing super mario 3D world, you're hyping up Bowser going to be really tough when in reality after all you went through he turned out easier than previous bosses, honestly it was a shame.\\n\\n\r\nDespite all of the flaws I had with the story, Bahamut\u2019s story is fun and exciting with great action sequences and lots of energy with cool ideas and dialogue that all follow the rule of cool but sadly is anticlimactic in the end and establishes a vast world foundation without that much depth added to it thanks to the inconsistent pacing.\\n\\n\r\nTHE CHARACTERS\\n\r\nThe characters of Shingeki no Bahamut are fun with different personalities to balance each other out.\\n\\n\r\nFavaro, he\u2019s the life of the show, like how pedophiles bring life to Dateline.  He\u2019s a character who provides comedy and seriousness when needed and is characterized excellently, he feels like a very fresh protagonist which has been lacking in anime for quite a while.  He like a fresh of breath air.  Throughout the series he grows as a character and you really get to see a dynamic change from the selfishness you witness in the beginning as he turns more selfless and starts to care for the people around him, especially growing an attachment to Amira which is something he never desired in the first place.  Hes got a decent back story that felt a tad bit rushed but it gave us a proper view on his past.  Stylish, witty, comedic, brave, shows growth, great characterization, and he\u2019s the closest thing to a n*gga in anime since Dutch, I\u013al take it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nKaiser is portrayed as Favaro\u2019s rival and is a fairly decent character, hes a knight that seems to fail more than an old man trying to hook up with hookers.  He acts upon emotion and acts without thinking for the most part, and his main objective is to kill Favaro for reasons that are explained in back story. But that is the nobility of a knight I suppose, for he has a a firm sense of justice that contrasts Favaros character.  His interactions with Favaro are great though I would have loved to see more added depth to Kaiser, but characterization was done well enough to make me give a damn about him so yayy to that.\\n\\n\r\nAmira I have mixed feelings for.  For the most part she is an interesting character but throughout the anime there was evidence of her just being a pawn moreso than a strong female character.  Don't get me wrong, shes a highly interesting character with a childlike personality for reasons that are explained, but though a pawn she never felt like a character I wished to be banished from the anime because she actually brought some humor and never felt like an annoyance on her travels.  Her characterization could have been a hell of a lot better and there isnt enough depth to call her character a good one.  But when she turns full on demon mode, she is more bad ass than Shrek, and those are the times when it\u2019s a blast to see her onscreen.\\n\\n\r\nRita is a zombie girl who cares for the main cast despite how cold she may be, and at first glance you might say, LOLI, LOLI! LOLI!!!  But she's nowhere near that archetype that you would initially speculate her to be.  Her contributions to the plot though few is helpful when needed, and we see a bit of growth for her character throughout the show to support her character.  I liked her character, she balanced everyone out whether telling Kaiser to snap back and think logically, or to shut down Favaro's stupidity.\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters could have gotten more development and characterization, especially Jean D\u2019Arc but what we got was decent.  My main flaw with the villains however is that their motivations are black and white, with their own motivation to be evil is to bring destruction, nothing more and nothing less.  They seemed to lack reasonings behind why they want destruction other than the fact that they're like ROAR IM A DEMON, but despite this at least they held somewhat of a presence onscreen.\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters of Bahamut are exciting, fun onscreen and characterized decently with some growth over time but side characters lack any type of depth and villains have black and white motivations.\\n\\n\r\nTHE ART/AMIMATION\\n\\n\r\nThe best part about Shingeki no Bahamut is the art/animation.  The art has a wide color palette with perfect colors for every environment to accompany the tone the show tries to convey.  The character designs I absolutely adore because they add to the style and flare of the show, I would have never thought I would have seen a main character with an Afro in anime, it's a revolution, black people are coming back in anime, March on Tokyo Street biatch!  This added to the rule of cool the show.  The backgrounds are detailed and the lighting for each scene was almost perfect.  The main flaw I have within the art is the CGI because it looks uglier than Meghan Fox\u2019s thumbs, it just didn\u2019t fit with the rest of the show.  The animation is fluent with no hiccups from what I could witness.  The character movements felt genuine though there is a bit of choppiness to be found and the fight scenes as stated previously were choreographed really well at various angles.  The special effects like the fog in the village and the bursts of explosions in the sky were all carefully done too adding the cherry to the pie for the art and animation.\\n\\n\r\nTHE SOUND\\n\\n\r\nSoundwise nothing much to say here, the voice acting was a job well done, especially Favaro and Kaiser\u2019s voice actors.  They packed emotion in their voices and in the case of Favaro a hint of comedy when needed.  The sound effects and mixing were spot on too.  Although the OST was fitting and was utilized splendidly, honestly I wasn\u2019t a big fan of it other than the opening song and another song in particular that I can\u2019t remember the name of.  To put it in short, it fit the tones of each scene in a sincerely great way.\\n\\n\r\nDespite all the flaws I had with Bahamut I found it to be an exhilarating and exciting story with great characters, decent music and wonderful art/animation.\\n\\n\r\nGiving the Story a 5.5\\n\r\nThe characters a 7.75\\n\r\nThe Art/Animation an 8.5\\n\r\nAnd the Sound a 6.5\\n\\n\r\nI award Bahamut with a score of 7.15 out of 10 giving it a recommendation of worth da watch.\\n",

            "content": "Shingeki no Bahamut is an anime that instantly becomes a favourite. The lack of episodes(only 12) is compensated by the interesting storyline, the beautiful and breathtaking art, and the overall Epicness of the show. The characters, especially the main one-the wild and \"handsome\" Favaro, are so unique and different that they give you a breath of fresh air. With the very first episode you are overwhelmed with the humor of the show and the character design. There are epic dragons, badass demons, lovely gods, strong warriors and interesting stuff regarding magic and powers. The ending is very satisfying and doesn't leave you hanging like manyanime series do. If you are wondering whether to watch it or not, i recommend watching  just the opening first, because it shows the amount of detail and the magnificent visuals (and the epic song by the band SiM)\\n\r\nThere are no cheesy, echy moments, so I think the anime is compatible with every kind of anime fan. I would also recommend it to people who have not yet watched anime!",

            "content": "Having randomly stumbled upon this Anime, I didn't know what I'd get. All I knew about it was that it was a Fantasy Anime, which I've seen a lot. So I thought it'd be some generic Anime which I'd forget about in a heartbeat. But I'm happy to say that that's not the case here. So, on to my review.Story:-\\n\\n\r\nWe're first introduced the world of Mistarica 2000 years ago, humans, demons and gods resided. During that period there arose the Bahamut, a mystical dragon that tried to destroy the world. But the demons, humans, gods worked together in order to seal the demon and in turn, the key to is seal was made. That's all the backstory needed.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I really liked about the story was that despite being linear and somewhat unoriginal, it still had enough twists and turns to keep me engaged from start to finish. The brilliant first episode introduced the main three characters and set the stage for the story and the many unexpected things to come. The Anime expertly manages to blend the elements of the ongoing war between the humans, angels and the demons without it feeling stale. The story has great pacing, and is compact. I never had a dull moment. The best thing of all was that the ending was absolutely great. It ended on a great note and honestly left a huge smile on my face.\\n\\n\r\n                                                         Animation and Sound:-\\n\\n\r\nOne word for the Animation, fantastic! The Animation is technically sound. The greatness is prevalent during the action sequences which were breathtaking to say the least. The 3D Animation here is actually well executed, unlike most Anime I've seen. Also the varied landscapes and environments were richly detailed and had a vast array of colours which made me love the world all the more.\\n\\n\r\nThe Anime doesn't disappoint in the sound department either. From the great orchestral sounds during battle sequences to the comedic moments, it was great. The OP is hugely addicting and I liked it a lot. The heavy metal combined with some Engrish made for a great minute and a half. The ED is good too, so that's all I can say about it. \\n\\n\r\n                                                               Character:-\\n\\n\r\nThe characters made this show, quite frankly. Favaro is easily my favourite character. From the first moment I saw him, I knew I'd like him. He's a bounty hunter by profession. His roguish behaviour, his devil-may-care attitude and general panache made him a delight to watch. Also count his witty banter with the rest of cast and we have ourselves a memorable character.\\n\\n\r\nKaisar, Favaro's best friend, is his polar opposite in character. He's a knight fallen from grace who had no choice but to become a bounty hunter. He's serious, uptight and has a strong sense of righteousness. He also has a bone to pick with Favaro for a reason which I can't discuss. His interactions with Favaro was great right from the start.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, we have our female lead, Amira. Her introduction made me think she'd be nothing more than a damsel in distress and fanservice character. But that's not the case at all. She's an oddball of sorts, who acts like a kid on various occasions. But her child-like curiosity towards ordinary things is endearing. Her development takes quite an interesting twist, to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the supporting characters. Firstly, Rita. She is easily the best side character. Her introduction made me think she'd be a one-episode affair, but that didn't happen. She also surprisingly provides comedic relief to the show. Special mention to Bacchus. He's a drunk God who can kick ass when the time calls for it. There's also a few characters who serve as the villains here. Nothing much to say about them other than the fact that they perform their roles well. Overall, all the characters were memorable.\\n\\n\r\n                                                        Enjoyment and Overall:-\\n\\n\r\nI can't help but easily recommend this Anime. It is a perfect combination of action, feels, excitement without a single boring moment. Easily one of the best Anime of 2014. So yeah, give it a watch. It's definitely worth it.",

            "content": "You know that feeling you have after watched a show that leaved you totally satisfied? Satisfied. That is what I feel after finishing \"Rage of Bahamhut\". It just became one of my all-time favorites, and it\u00b4s been a while since I found one of those. It had everything I wanted it to have - great adventure story, awesome characters, well timed comedy, good music, a bit of romance, magic, demons, angels, gods, dragons, epic battles, and did I mentioned necromancers and zombies? All so well worked out and well-rounded in just these 12 episodes that not a second felt ill spent, unexplored, unanswered  orunsatisfying to me. And apparently studio MAPPA created this awesome adventure of some digital card game as source material. Respect. I enjoyed this show from the first seconds to the last. Exactly why did I think \"Rage of Bahamut\" was so great? I will go down to that know.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\r\nThe thing I liked most about the \"Rage\" was that it had a really relaxed attitude towards itself. It never took it self to seriously or tried to be something more than it was. It mixed adventure, fantasy, action, storytelling, drama and comedy brilliantly well. All genres flowing so smoothly into on another, that not once did I cringe, thought it was stupid or boring. The story is a classical Fantasy/adventure one. How fate and some simple lies brings some people together and their fate is sild. Angels vs. demons, god keys and a child looking for its mother. Ancient super powerful beast that could destroy the world.  Knights, magic, holy weapons and a great evil agenda. I can keep going for a while but I rest my case there. The pacing of the story was also very even - the show and its characters did never just stand still or felt rushed. Each episode was a satisfying piece in this adventure that was \"Rage of Bahamut\" to me \u2013 the story progressed nicely together with the characters. All questions and doubts I might had have during the show were all answered or explained. Of course one can ask them self questions to the infinity, but all the questions that concerned the main story and characters was all satisfactory answered. The endings are one of the best I\u00b4ve seen. It had everything to leave me satisfied with the story and the characters development, and not wish for more and yet which there was more from there this came from. The comedy used in the show was refreshingly well timed and funny - I laughed loads to this show. The story also provided me to be really emotionally invested. The plot and characters really invited me to care about what happened to them \u2013 funny moments, interesting moments, exciting moments, emotional moments and life changing moments, flow so well into each other. The sad sequences were so masterfully done that I freaking cried rivers, and I almost never cry. The show has a great way of building the plot, characters and tempo until the end. You know, a typical adventure story often goes like this: people meet because of fate, a quest is started, enemies starts to appear, the mystery thickens, end-of the-world-realization, battle/fight end game. \u201cRage of Bahamut\u201d follows this formula and does it right and exciting in every aspect. By using every second of its time to explore the story and lets its characters bath in meaningful screen, Rage shines bright all the way. Put simply, if you are a fan of adventure stories.. Well, it can\u00b4t be a miss. One of the best I seen - and I been digging around that department pretty deep now. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nIt\u00b4s a 2014 production, so the art and animation are really great \u2013 you can tell that some money been put in to this. \u201cRage of Bahamut\u201d has the best animated dragons I ever seen. The details and proportions of the dragons are very well done. The animation is a joy on its own - really smooth and fluid, and not once did I hinted a jerkiness. This will be very clear in the action and fight scenes \u2013 such an eye pleaser. Bodies and weapons are moving fast and swift without a hitch. Perfectly timed dramatic and comedian effects together with brilliant fight scenes made this a visual experience above normal. The art is perfectly suits the story and its characters. The color palette that is used are somewhere between super-happy \u2013anime-color- explosion and its darker opposite end. I liked that the two main male characters had a really unique design \u2013 Favaros hair, and Kaisers\u2026 hum.. pants. You will know what I mean. The colors deserve its own tribute. Beautiful backgrounds and surroundings, with nice details in the houses and buildings. Glowing colors was used for the angels holy glow and magic, and the demons burning blue fires and eyes \u2013 in the most possibly good way. I must give the art and animation a clear 10 because of the overall impression it left me with, and that it held the quality all the way throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nI absolutely loved the soundtrack on its own, and how well it suited the show. It highlighted every moment \u2013 dramatic, exiting, sad, funny, interesting and so on. It was always spot on for me. As fitting for an adventure/fantasy story much classical instrumental music was used \u2013 and boy did I liked it! Some of the characters also had their \u201cown\u201d music during some screen time. Rita\u00b4s music brought out her character brilliantly. I loved those scenes. The OP song is a heavy metal rock piece that I actually came to like a lot thanks to the adventure that is \u201cRage of Bahamut\u201d. Together with great visuals it made up an important part of the show to me. The ED song is much slower and sadder, which reflect the emotional and sometimes really f*cking sad parts of the story. \\n\\n\r\nFor the VA`s I watched the dubbed and liked it a lot. The VA\u00b4s were really well matched with their characters and brought them to life. They had embraced the essence of their character to the core \u2013 absolutely loved it. Without them this story wouldn\u00b4t has been half as good. All cred to them.  All backgrounds sound was doing its job, and laid that perfect extra layer to whole impression.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nA 10 again? How biased is this woman? You may ask yourself at this point. Well, quite biased to be honest, but the show is truly a piece to enjoy if you into the genres. And the characters are the cherry on the top of this \u201cRage of Bahamut\u201d cake. It\u2019s for shore some archetypes, but done in such a manner and in right way, so that I care for and feel something every single character \u2013 sides and all. Their characteristic personalities are used to their full potential, brought forth by the plot and interacting with other characters. That was that impressed me the most - are still a bit awed. Background stories are so well knitted together with the characters current position in the story and situation. It made it possible to keep some mystery surrounding the characters and the plot, for it all to make sense during time and round it all up in the last episode. I felt that all characters (main, sides, villains and so on) were treated with respect \u2013 they had an important role to fill and they all was given the opportunity to for filling those roles. The character interactions and dynamic was brilliant \u2013 they made this story so enjoyable. How the conversations and interactions both developed the characters and pulled the plot forwards were masterly done. Their friendships, relationships, alliances and enemies felt very believable. All the characters actions and desire felt logical and understandable. Even Amira\u00b4s childish persona had its very logical explanation, and her persona did not once bother me. She pulled the adventure forward and made other characters to grow.\\n\\n\r\nThe story follows the-bounty-hunter-childhood-friends-now-enemies ,Favaro and Kasier, the half demon on a quest, Amira, and necromancer and now zombie, Rita.  Favaro is your typical go-lucky guy that has a bit of shady personality. He loves booze, women and money. Kaiser is the dishonored knight with a long gone grudge against Favaro. He\u00b4s only goal is to restore honor to his father\u2019s name (and get back at Favaro). Amira\u00b4s only wish is to find her mother, and acts very much like a child. With that said she is a half demon and fights much like one. Rita on the other hand has a child\u2019s body, but has a centuries old personality. Her calm, indifferent attitude could make shills of terror run down the bravest man\u00b4s spine. Well, she is a necromancer zombie with a hobby for magical concoctions after all. These four very different persons are pulled together by some force (fate, destiny, chance?), and are thrown into an adventure that will decide the fate of the world. To see how their journey played out was hilarious, heartwarming, exciting, emotional, heartbreaking and awesome all in one. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI had an absolute blast watching \u201cRage of Bahamut\u201d! Like I said before, it has become one of my all-time favorites. Long time sense I seen such a satisfying anime. Satisfying, there is that word again. If I had to describe \u201cRage\u201d with one word it would that word \u2013 satisfying. It had all I could ask for \u2013 fantasy plot well done, moveable characters, great comedy, magically done action/fights, heartwarming and heartbreaking moments, awesome ending and big ass dragons. Full score, home run, jack pot - in every department for me. I can\u00b4t find a little tiny tawny bit I disliked or thought could have been done better. Every second felt well spent and enjoyed. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nI am going to keep it short here.  Overall one of the best adventure/fantasy stories I ever seen. Still can\u00b4t believe they managed to do all that with a card game as source material. Truly impressed. It will be rewatched many times in the coming years. Enjoy! \\n",

            "content": "Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis is a surprising gem that does not deserve to be nearly as good as it is. Coming from the still very young studio MAPPA, with a director that has directed nothing particulary of note except Tiger and Bunny, and based on a card battle game for mobile devices - I would not have been surprised in the least if it was mediocre. But obviously, from my first sentence, it certainly wasn't.\r\nBut let's break it down:\r\n~~STORY~~\r\nSnB:G's story is simple, and simple doesn't mean bad. It's an epic adventure to stop a great evil from awakening, not really a unique plot in anime;but if you're able to look past that fact, you'll see it's a simple story well-told. While the story happens in a variety of different places (This is a fantasy world after all, inhabited by demons, gods, monsters and such), I never found myself thinking 'now how did we end up here again?'. While the story does occasionally suffer from certain conveniences and coincidences, none were bad enough to tear me away.\\n\r\nOne thing I did notice was that it felt like the last few episodes were a little 'compressed', so to say. Some things don't get sufficiently explained, and it kind of made me wonder if it was intended to be 13 episodes originally.\\n\\n\r\n~~ART~~\\n\r\nOh yes, oh yes, oh yes! MAPPA, after last season's beautifully animated Zankyou no Terror and this season's Garo: The Animation as well as SnB:G, I can definitely see them becoming one of the top studios for stunning weekly animation. The animation quality of each episode was movie-quality (I was watching the first episode when a friend walked in and asked if it was a new anime movie!) and even the CG animation (which I usually hate) was some of the best I've seen in anime. The colours are beautiful and varied, matching the tone of each scene, the backgrounds are stunning, and the detail for what is often a very grandiose anime is top notch. Great work!\\n\\n\r\n~~SOUND~~\\n\r\nYoshihiro Ike, if I ever have to fight for humanity, write my battle theme. The soundtrack of SnB:G is very fitting. Perhaps not a soundtrack that you'd listen to by itself, but with the visuals it blends perfectly to create the atmosphere it desires. It is grand, it is exciting, and it fits well. You can't expect anything more.\\n\\n\r\n~~CHARACTERS~~\\n\r\nI was surprised to find myself really liking most of the main cast of SnB:G by the end of it. The main cast are all enjoyable in their own ways and all go though a subtle but fulfilling arc - showing that they've all changed for the better at the shows conclusion. The dynamics and interactions between the main cast are also enjoyable and stay consistent for each character. It's something that is hard to find in many anime - characters that are 'themselves' but still change organically. There's no single moment where a character suddenly changes, it feels natural - and I really appreciate it.\\n\r\nThe side characters are also well developed, especially for the screen time they're given. The characters you're not supposed to like, you won't - not because they kick puppies or anything radical like that, rather through their body language and word choice and not just their actions define them. It's about a character HAVING character, rather then having to tell you what their character is.\\n\r\nDespite this heaping praise, I wouldn't be able to say that any of the characters are 'deep' - this isn't a character drama after all, it's a fantasy adventure. But everything else still stands - simple, well-written characters are a treat that aren't as common as they should be in anime.\\n\\n\r\n~~ENJOYMENT~~\\n\r\nLoved it. Was there every week to see the latest episode. The simple story did not turn me away in the slightest since the rest of the show was so well executed. Would definitely watch again.\\n\\n\r\n~~OVERALL~~\\n\r\nShingeki no Bahamut: Genesis could have been bad and it would have been fine. Instead we got an epic adventure, fantastically well-executed, well animated and just all round enjoyable. Would not be surprised to see this one turn up in the year's top 10's.\\n\\n\r\nToodles~",

            "content": "Review about Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis\r\nWhen I first stumbled upon Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis I was on the lookout for a series reminiscent of Berserk or Claymore: a mature medieval adventure with demons, magic and knights. SnB did not disappoint me at all. While it's lighter than both aforementioned titles, I found it much more entertaining.\r\nLet me start by praising the art. One word: SUPERB. Everything is extremely detailed, from the landscapes to the characters, their abilities and their design. You can tell this anime has a high budget from the get-go.\r\nThe main idea is fairly simple. Bahamut, a metallic-looking dragon, is a seemingly unstoppableforce of nature whose only purpose is to rain chaos and destruction upon all creation, be it Heaven or Hell. By the combined might of the Gods and the Lords of Hell, he was sealed on Earth. Satan and Zeus sacrificed themselves to create two keys, meant to be kept away for all eternity in order to prevent Bahamut from breaking free.\\n\\n\r\nFast-foward several thousand of years. Favaro, a cocky and mischievous bounty hunter, stumbles upon Amira, a very innocent girl that seems to be a lot more than meets the eye. Kaisar, a disgraced knight turned bounty hunter, blames Favaro for his current situation and is determined to regain his honor back by exacting revenge.\\n\\n\r\nFavaro, Amira and Kaisar, who could not be more different from one another, get entangled into something they could have never imagined. \\n\\n\r\nThat's all I'll say about the plot because you will soon start discovering things for yourself. The show moves at a quick rate and does a pretty good job at keeping you entertained, be it by its humor, it's visual or it's fast-paced story. The overall feel of SnB is of semi-mature medieval adventure with little emphasis in romance. Whatever cuteness there is to be found in this anime reeks of fan service. Fortunately, it's kept to a bearable low and does not affects the tone of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters are different from one another and all of them get their fair share of exposure and development; the supporting cast is also quite varied. \\n\\n\r\nAt 12 episodes, Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis leaves you wanting for more. The world-building was top notch and leaves room for exploration if the creators ever decide to release more seasons.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a few cons. The last episodes feels like they are throwing everything at your face and this can be a little overwhelming. The show goes from being fast-paced to being on steroids. However, it manages to stays inside the lines. The ending was satisfactory in the sense that it gives closure to the overall story, but it leaves a lot to be desired if you wanted to know more about the Demons, Angels and the title star, Bahamut.\\n\\n\r\nAmira can get annoying and repetitive; she is eye-candy for the most part. Another thing that kept me from giving it a higher score was that some of the decision the characters made, made no sense and could be described as contrived.\\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoyed watching Berserk or Claymore, I have no doubt you will love Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis. And while it's not as dark or serious as either of them, it still can be considered a mature anime for all intents and purposes.\\n\\n\r\nA well deserved 7.5 rating.\\n",

            "content": "Shingeki No Bahamut:\r\nMINDSET:\r\nCool, fun and epic-ish action adventure show that should not be taken seriously. Only watch it for the woeful and charmful rather than OMG! I'm f**king crying bruv!\r\nSYNOPSIS:\r\nAfro Ginger Bounty Hunter/Asian skinned protagonist encounters a demon girl, in which he became a demon in the next day. After that, we found out that she has some flipping item inside her body that is really important according from the fantasy realm she lives in, and now they want it back. Without question, Afro Ginger decides to venture with the demon named Amira to rid his curse for having a tail.\r\nREVIEW:\r\nThis show is more likeAfro Ginger goes to an epic adventure involving demons with simple-minded action while following the rule of cool. It strays away from being serious or follow some sort of theme to make things fascinating. This is further emphasised by the characters alone, since these people never really develop and you get to know them better further in duration, but there is no change to Afro Ginger being a silly thief, to a noble knight. They are in respect, two dimensional characters; they have a reasonable motive behind their actions yet are governed by two personalities. Like Kaisar, a man of nobility but desires vengeance towards the protagonist, Afro Ginger.\\n\\n\r\n Now it is more subtle than just \u201caction\u201d since involving travel can make a lot of villains to hunt down is not enough and they need to involve plot. No. Having a succubus and a demon lord who has Yaoi inspiration while the two doing jack for the most part is not serious! The show is more plot involved and trying to get the characters to fight whatever random sh*t comes ahead. Now, it has potential from the first episode to be something more than that, but the characters (especially Ginger) address that this show is far from deep or anything nerdgasm'able from epicness.\\n\\n\r\nNo, conveying a loli with Kaisar for assistance as a necromancer was clearly implanted that she\u2019s just their to help out in many battles. (trying to spoil little) Through more time, the show is trying to create some sort of concrete plot involving a capture with this demon chick because she contains a certain item inside of her and involving kidnap felt far from epic. Why do we care about these people? There is no actual development, there is no reason why we have to really care from their pasts and their wasn\u2019t enough screen for us to get attached. \\n\\n\r\nIt seemed quite out of nowhere that Amira's stated persona was that of a Kudere, after getting drunk on wine, she was re-written into a tomboy throughout the entire show. Well I guess that would make things quite boring then, though it could've been fine if we just let her personality stay as the time she was drunk right from the get go, but whatever.\\n\\n\r\nThrough all of the points I have said, this makes the plot rather predictable due to the shows light-heartedness, there was no scene in this show when I felt it was being dramatic and even if You can't predict when the moments of sh*t hitting the fan, it does seem easy to predict how its going to play out or end. You know if they kidnap some of the cast to mythical dimension that Afro Ginger is going to save them, and come back alive. Well it did felt that way, and the show can make things a bit more interesting in the presentation of this bit of the narrative for it to be better.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation looked more high budgeted than anything else, other than some pretty cheesy CGI at times, it was'nt too bad and the backgrounds look very detailed and the action scenes just are fluid, and look awesome at the same time. Character designs all blend quite well together with strange hair styles, and everyone look memorable to look at. Clear effort was put into this and the budget remained very consistent all throughout.\\n\\n\r\nThe music consisted of orchestral tunes than anything else, no fancy electric guitar excluding the OP/ED songs, it tends to have a decision of either using a western theme, or an epic orchestral theme. Though it works well with the material given. The OP did seem a little unpredictable and doesn\u2019t suit the show that much, but it was really trying to follow the rule of cool than anything else.\\n\\n\r\nLEGACY:\\n\r\nOne of those \u201cepic\u201d shows that turned out to be \u201ccool\u201d but it may be predictable at times, but was it bad. No. I suppose everyone were needlessly unconsciously masturbatingly bondaged to their Urobuctchers and the f**king FSN remake which allowed the anime to left under the rug from mass appeal.\\n\\n\r\nCRITICAL SCORE:\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 6.5/10 \u2013 The characters (without the use of Archetypes) fit the material quite well. Though far from complex.\\n\r\nSTORY:  6.5/10 \u2013 Its more of a cool action/adventure show than anything else. Plus point five for the road journey and epic-ish narrative.\\n\r\nANIMATION: 7.5/10 \u2013 Cool action scenes, great back drops and AFRO GINGER. What else is there to say? \\n\r\nSOUND: 7.5/10 \u2013 Great OP, and nicely done acoustic variety OST.\\n\\n\r\nFINALE: 7/10 (afro ginger ftw....) \\n\\n\r\nPERSONAL SCORE: (enjoyment)\\n\r\n6/10 \u2013 Since the story is quite meh to how I see it, so I lost interest ages ago. All what I wanted to see were the characters just being themselves while watching some great action. Was it epic? No.",

The show seem to have a lot of complexity when it come to the lore, but the story is rather simple in it's complexity. I found myself confused over the exposition dumps the show takes and the entire thing seems a bit rushed. Though, it may be due to the 12 episode run time. I felt like things weren't explained enough, causing a lot of the events in the show seema bit random, even by the conclusion. Also, the main characters, who i enjoy, get into and out of problems quite conveniently. A lot of coincidences cause a lot of the events in the story.  This cause the story to seem quite sloppy, yet the characters and the world they set up is very interesting. Another thing i'd like to note is the fact that the animation is superb. And, the character designs are excellent. Overall, I liked the show, though a little disappointed, I'd recommend for you to try it out.",

            "content": "Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis is easily the top-dog of 2014. And it's based off of a card game to boot. \r\nI'm very critical when it comes to anime, and I've never given out a 10/10 because nothing seemed worthy of it. Most animes I say barely go into 6 or 7 territory. This anime came insanely close to being my first 10/10. \r\nEvery episode starts off with so much energy that it just makes you excited and keeps you watching. I was amazed the show could keep itself in check story wise due to the large scale world it presented. From start to finish, itfelt great. \\n\\n\r\nThe only thing I can really complain about, is the very final minutes. The ending felt satisfying enough and wrapped up almost 100% of everything it showed, but the flow of the show kind of lost itself. There was a lot of emotion in the final moments, but then it just drops suddenly when switching to another scene(you'll know what I mean if you watch it) and all the emotion is kind of lost. It felt pretty out of character for the show. There was no easing into it. It just kind of switched abruptly. If the show had an extra 5 or 10 minutes, I think it could have wrapped up into a perfect 10/10. \\n\\n\r\nFor my literal score, 9.4/10. Must-watch.",

            "content": "Warning possible Spoilers\r\nGoing into Rage of Bahamut: Genesis I wasn't expecting much, especially considering this is based off a mobile card game so you couldn't really make much of a story out of it, yet to my surprise the more I watched it, the better it got.\r\nStory (8/10)\r\nThe story concentrates on Favaro, a carefree bounty hunter, however his cosy life is interrupted when he meets a mysterious girl called Amira, but their meeting would cause the beginning of a major catastrophe.\r\nNow the story at first had a LOTR feel to it, our main character finds a mysterious object or person and they need to getthem somewhere, this was enjoyable though seeing the different situations Favaro and Amira got caught up in which did produce a good couple of laughs.\\n\r\nThen once it reaches the midway point, we see Kaiser and Rita becoming more major characters and a big ass battle happens that really did feel like the battle at Helm's Deep, but it is at this point where the story does come to a slow crawl for me as we get more exposition on the situation and what it may lead to.\\n\r\nHowever the best was still to come, because the final episodes just blew me the fu*k away, some people might say the amount of stuff that happened made the anime feel rushed, but to me it was epic to watch even a little emotional at times and I felt really satisfied by the end of the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nWhat Rage of Bahamut definitely has is good characters, well mostly, there was the odd character that didn't feel right or just annoyed me a little, but the show managed to make some of these characters better by the end.\\n\r\nFavaro Leone is of course the best character, if not the best part of the whole show, because Favaro is one of those rare male protagonists who seems like a cool douchebag, which he technically is, but even when he does something stupid or makes a poor decision you just can't get mad at the guy and the amount of jokes he pulls out of his ass is just fantastic, there wasn't a single moment I hated the guy and his badass fighting skills just made him even more awesome. Although you do see his character change by the end in some way, he is a little more serious and does show his caring side towards his friends during the final battle, so he isn't always a cool douchebag, he actually has a heart somewhere.\\n\r\nAmira is a half Demon, half Angel who meets Favaro at the beginning of the series, I was originally thinking Amira was going to be one of those silent characters who wouldn't say a lot, but instead what I got was a glutenous, hyper, funny and very curious character. She was actually a bunch of fun when she was teamed up with Favaro who always mocked or joked around with each other. You also feel sorry for the girl at times too since all she wanted was to see her mother and their confrontation actually ends up being one of the more emotional parts of the show, Amira is that character who you can just have a fun time with, but also feel sad for them when something bad happens to them.\\n\r\nKaiser Lidford who is a Knight turned bounty hunter, he was the weak link out of the main characters and seemed quite annoying at first especially whenever he would go on about Favaro screwing up his life, but slowly over time he actually becomes a decent character despite his stupidity and it was actually pretty cool seeing him and Favaro finally teaming up to defeat the bad guy.\\n\r\nRita is a necromancer, despite not really saying all that much throughout the show, Rita ended up being an even better character than Kaiser for sure, because whenever Favaro or Kaiser did something stupid she would always end up whacking them or mocking them in a pretty savage way and this made her such an enjoyable character to have around. Not only that she knows a thing or two about making creepy potions that end up helping the others out during the final battle along with the fact she can bring anything dead into a zombie, which definitely helps if you're facing an army.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nDespite a good abundance of CGI, it wasn't terrible CGI and I managed to stomach it, but aside from that it is amazing how Studio MAPPA managed to create such an interesting and detailed world from just a mobile card game and you have to admit that requires a lot of skill, which they pulled off very nicely.\\n\r\nI loved the clothing that the characters wore, it fitted their personalities and their occupation very well, plus I also liked the differences between the Angel and Demon races because for once they actually looked like they were proper Gods and would absolutely destroy you if you pissed them off.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nEven though the ed didn't do much for me, which isn't really a surprise, the op was friggin awesome. It's one of those op's that starts off alright, but the more you listen to it, the better it gets and the rock band style worked very well for depicting what the anime has in store for you.\\n\\n\r\nExtras:\\n\\n\r\nIf there is one I can say about this show, is that it has brilliant comedy, true most of it is thanks to Favaro, but even Amira, Kaiser and especially Rita manage to come up with some truly funny moments, the chemistry between the characters worked really well and that is definitely one of the strongest parts this show had.\\n\r\nThe action is also something that was pretty damn good, the battle at Anatae was really cool to see, despite feeling like an anime version of the battle at helms deep, but those final episodes were chock filled with great action moments and made me feel glad I watched this series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall this was a surprisingly good anime and has me looking forward to the Virgin Soul series that I will hopefully be watching very soon to close off my anime's for 2017.",

The quality of the scenario and story makes me want more of it. But the ending lacked lots of explanations and had some inconsistencies.\r\nWell paced, with only some problems in the last episodes where things were happening too fast. It kept me interested all the way to the end.\r\nThe characters are great and well developed. The chemistry between the main characters is amazing and really fun to watch. The author took the time needed to developthese characters and reveal their motivations and the result was really good. Some character arcs do not have an satisfying end.\\n\\n\r\nIt is visually very good, has a very fluid animation and the 3D sometimes bugged me, mainly in the end. In my opinion the quality of the animation is one of the best if not the best part of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is amazing, but it is not as memorable as it could be and sometimes the music does not fit the scene, mostly on some combat or epic scenes. But the voices and sounds are great, really immersed me in the scenes.",

            "content": "Another review enjoy. Gonna try my best to fully remember have been watching alot of anime back to back recently so im just hoping the important stuff stick with me for this review.\r\nStory- A medieval type of feel and look, The story consists of 2 guys who are bounty hunters and a girl whos half demon and half who is looking for her mother.... basically thats it. I liked the story although my description wasnt really giant im keeping it as basic as possible i really liked the story mainly because of the girl main character because of how Bad*** she was. Humans, Gods anddemons all live in the same time so clearly it is bound to give you something thats either really great or really dissapointing but the story i found was pretty damn good i shall say the ending previous scene to the ending is sad but at the same time fulfilling and the complete ending is like the beginning scene of the show but both characters have grown a bit older honestly the story was really good imo trying not to spoil it sorry if i cant really say much. \\n\\n\r\nArt- the show looks great def not the 10/10 GREATEST looking thing but it looks good the way its animated is the better part it just looks really fluid it flows smooth funny character expressions good looking character designs along with some kick ass scenes that are just beautifully animated you get something very good. 9/10 just looks great\\n\\n\r\nSound- When it comes to sound im really not an expertise all's i can really tell you is the opening is so awesome seems like a hard rock/metal type song the sword clashing scenes are done well sound really good im not super up and up on sound so kinda brief but lets just say the sound is good and is definitely enough to not turn you off.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- Amira, Rita, Favaro,  Kaisar.... these are the main characters that are the most important aside from the main villain. I liked all the main protagonists and even the villains, the main characters didn't really go through alot of character development but they were interesting enough  to keep you tuned in. Rita a zombie, amira half demon half god, Favaro the funny guy with an afro, kaiser determined knight it just all intertwines into something that gives you good entertainment the comedy is well placed and the characters are just good that is all.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- I really enjoyed the series it honestly felt like online rpg or mmo game and you have that one really overpowered character but overtime everything evens out you meet stronger ppl and bosses and it becomes a challenge by the end and trying to find a weakness in your final enemy in order to win. I felt it was just like a game which really kept me tuned in i thought the show was funny well placed comedy with a bit of feels and the awesome action and fantasy background it makes just want to see something like it.\\n\\n\r\noverall- Very good show 8/10 the only thing i really just disliked was the scene b4 the ending although it was nice and sweet and just a big thank you for helping me i really dislike having a character that i like and suddenly vanishes.\\n\\n\r\nFINAL JURISDICTION: if you like that old kind of medieval feel or just a fantasy action based anime i recommend you add it to your list and hopefully you enjoy it as much as i did. Its not special so dont get the wrong idea but its quite good just honestly watch it with no expectations and you will like it if you are the type of person who compares anime to other anime that are similar and one is just a classic basically its ever really gonna live up to what you want. So Watch it but have little to no expectations in order to enjoy it.\\n\\n\\n",

I still managed to be surprised.\r\nHow can that be if I got a good anime when I expected one? Shouldn't I have gotten exacly what I expected?\r\nIt's because this anime, this Shingeki No Bahamut, it does almost everything uniquely, and very well so. Mostly the characters, they're very welldesigned and it's not often in serious anime we get a character with an afro as an MC.\\n\\n\r\nThe bad rep of 12-episode-series, which usually don't have a real ending or are poorly animated and are only made to fill up screen time, have recieved a true hero. An ember that shines trough the darkness to light up the way. And all who shall follow shall be judged by this standard.\\n\\n\r\nBahamut will pull you in, it will introduce you to the characters masterfully, it will present it's story respectfully, and it will surprise you.\\n\r\nA show can be done well in only 12 episodes, this is proof. Shows that \"need more episodes\" are lackluster by comparison.",

            "content": "(Just a small review.NO SPOILERS CONTAINED, so feel free to read, and sorry for my English, it's not my native language.) \r\nOne of the few anime out there without being adopted by a manga. Snb is a unique anime in almost every aspect. Nice to watch, and enjoyable. Let's go to more detail:\r\nStory 8\r\n(maybe) A classic story  for this genre of anime. The story flaws well for me, and for some people it may flaws too fast. Only 1 filler episode, and the ending was pretty satisfying. A few plot holes like 'what happened to him/her after... etc' Can't wait for season 2 toexplain everything!\\n\\n\r\nArt 10\\n\r\nNot many things to say. The animation is OUTSTANDING. Incredible landscapes, detailed characters. The animation remains outstanding all the time. Perfectly fits the anime\\n\\n\r\nSound 8\\n\r\nVery good voice acting, and the backround music fits the atmosphere. Not the most remarkable music out there, but still it's perfect for this anime. Not to mention, the anime has an AMAZING opening. Well, at least for me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8\\n\r\nWell-rounded characters doing funny and epic things. Both villains and protagonists have nice backstories( as much as we know so far) and the supporting cast does a great job. Not a few, but also not too many characters. Although, i can't say that there are the best characters i've ever seen, but here, everyone is doing a great job.  At least he/she has a reason to exist\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8 \\n\r\nAs i wrote at 'about me' section on my profile, i gave this anime an 8. '' A really great anime/manga that I personally enjoyed in the end, but it still had some small flaws I couldn't over look. It fulfills almost all my expectations. '' I don't think (at least most of you) will dislike the series and for a non anime fan, this is a nice anime to watch( as i said there is no manga, so manga readers you only have to watch the anime). Definetely a memorable anime for me, mostly because of the art/animation and this 'fantasy-magic-dragon' thing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8 \\n\r\nSo, if you are the type of guy who likes fantasy, dragons, demons and magic, you should watch this anime. If you dislike it in the end, ok, it's a small one so don't complain. :P\\n\r\nThank you for reading!\\n",

            "content": "As you might already know, Rage Of Bahamut is actually an online Card Collection game brought to life thanks to Cygames, studio MAPPA, also Naoyuki Onda - serving as chief animation director and character designer, and more.\r\n1) Story: The title says it all, but if you need more details...\r\nBahamut is a creature more powerful, in sense of magic ability, than any known human, angel,demon or even a God. Only by a miracle, the God Zeus and the Demon God united their power to seal Bahamut.  It has been 2000 years since Bahamuts' rage lasted upon the earth, and now, 2000 years later his sealis in peril. Humans, angels and  demons alike, fear Bahamuts' return. This immortal and terrifying being has endless passion for destruction and that is its only wish. Bahamut can only be resurrected by joining the 2 god keys kept across the cathedral of angels and the wretched demons' domain. Will they be able to protect the land if Bahamut is revived?\\n\\n\r\n2) Art: Really beautiful art, magnificent scenery of fantasy nature. Majestically animated realms of the creatures known to us as angels and demons. I think that's about that, but there are also some battle scenes which look great in terms of animation, really cool.\\n\\n\r\n3) Sound: You may have already heard the opening, or it's funny misheard lyrics that first got my attention to this masterpiece. By any means the music in the show is great, so are the voicing crews, generally good sound directing. At some points I had to turn down the volume because the screaming was performed very realistically, the neighbors would probably think somebody was really screaming in here. The ending theme was cute.\\n\r\n10/10 for the sound.\\n\\n\r\n4) Characters: We meet the always fighting Hammer Head (Kaisar) and Bomber Head (Favaro) in the first episode. The past of these two and their arguments will be unraveled in the show. Later, we are introduced with the God Bacchus (a drunk), and also his duck. We also meet the beautiful, kind and sweet, yet hungry - Amira, Rita, who likes to call others kids, yet she looks like a kid herself. A glorious iron maiden, Jeanne d'Arc, blessed by the gods. The characters are astonishing. I forgot to mention the glorious angels. They are as bright and beautiful as the sun. We might as well say that the demons are a reflection of the moon. Light and darkness in balance.\\n\r\nI personally enjoyed the illuminating presence of the angels.\\n\\n\r\n5) Enjoyment: Enjoyed every part of this amazing adventure. There was anticipation, mystery, funny moments, hungry moments, sad moments, happy moments, moments that make you go wow, and such. I was very curious to find out about the characters' pasts and what awaited them in the future.\\n\\n\r\n6) Overall: Greatness. I am very pleased with Rage Of Bahamut. What I liked the most was Amira, she is awesome. I heard we are also getting a second season so I will be looking forward to that.\\n\\n\\n\r\n(Thanks for reading and have a good day. Message me if you find any errors, as I will be more careful next time I attempt to make any reviews.)\\n\\n",

            "content": "Hi. My name is Phil and I'm a huge fan of dark fantasy, especially when it's the kind of dark fantasy that mashes a lot of elements from different genres together and makes it somewhat plausible. So, yeah, I really like that kind of stuff. I loved Record of Lodoss War when it came out ten years ago, I dug the hell out of Berserk and Basilisk, I was genuinely entertained by last season's Hitsuge no Chaika and I was immensely disappointed by Blade and Soul that kinda sorta fit into that kind of anime as well (but, well, sucked like crazy from episode 4on out).\\n\\n\r\nAnd, mark my words, we might have a new competitor for \"Most Entertaining Dark Fantasy Anime in Recent Years\", seeing as it has become kind of a trend in recent anime to go full dark fantasy on the viewers (a trend I support with all my heart and soul). MAPPA just goes all-out crazy this year with its series', first Summer Season's excellent Zankyou no Terror directed by oldschool-otaku favorite Shinichiro Watanabe (Cowboy Bebop, Macross Plus, Samurai Champloo), now this season's Garo (created by the same dude who gave us the decent cyberpunk-/girls with guns-B-action-OVA Iria) and this review's topic: Shingeki no Bahamut - Genesis, directed by oldschool-otaku favorite Keiichi Sato who took big parts in creating the City Hunter-OVAs, Tiger &amp; Bunny and - of course - The Big O (which, if you haven't watched it yet, you should abso-freaking-lutely watch. Right. Now.).\\n\\n\r\nThe story is based on a collectible card game in which different factions are in kind of a cold war with one another after they successfully murdered a big-ass dragon called The Bahamut. Now, years later, a mysterious demon girl appears and takes one part of the key away that presumably might reawaken the dragon... or so we are led to believe right now. It's a classic \"We have to go there to do that!\"-plot that is told in an episodical fashion. Or, to put it simple: it'S 90s as fuck. A fact that I absolutely adore about this series. There's also a little love triangle thrown in there with said demon girl and two bounty hunters that follow her around, but it's not really in the foreground. So far, it's just a few characters caught up in a big ole mess involving humans, gods, demons, demon hunters, half-demons, pirates, zombies, zombie pirates, zombie pirate fish monsters that look like they came straight out of the black lagoon and giant enemy crabs. And a big-ass dragon. Yes, this series is completely out of its mind - in all the good ways.\\n\\n\r\nSo, the plot is very standard and kind of a clusterfuck - but trust me when I say that everything else about the series is top-notch stuff: you get three/four (depending on how you look at it) incredibly likeable main characters, each of them with their own little quirks and well-explained motivations behind their actions, each of them a badass in their own respective right and a cast of at least memorable supporting characters who might get their chances to shine individually in later episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals are beautiful, MAPPA clearly puts their A-game out in this series: crisp animation (especially in the action sequences the series has to offer) mixed with at least passable, sometimes even downright beautiful CGI-effects give me nice Blue Sub No. 6-flashbacks (and really make me hate Blade and Soul even more because that one had okay handdrawn animation and okay CGI, too - and Gonzo could've had a series this good as well!). The character designs are nicely done and are like a breeze of fresh air in the wasteland that is modern anime character-designs - no moe-schlock, no We-only-need-two-lips-animations-when-our-characters-talk-kinda deal, not too many still frames of stuff happening - there's always something nice to look at on the screen. I escpecially like the character's facial expressions. The constantly sceptical look an Amira's face whenever Leone tries to bs his way out of one of his many, many lies is priceless.\\n\\n\r\nNow on to sound - did you google the opening yet? No? Google the opening. Listen to it. Now combine this with the orchestra- and choir-driven score of the series and the sadly kind of lackluster (but still okay) ending song and you get why I chose to give a 9 in this category, right? Need. Single. Now.\\n\\n\r\nI gave the enjoyment category a 10, even though the series overall is a clear 9 for me. The 10 results not only from the fact that I haven't had this much fun with an anime series in years because of its action, its great comedy, its cool visuals and its extremely likable characters - but holy smokes, this series is also a freaking reference-fest! Not only to the card game itself, but also to a crapton of movies, video games, even a noteable hentai game-series! Just counting all these is a fun aspect of the show in and of itself, be it classic Errol Flynn-swashbuckler-movies, Evil Dead, italo westerns (name of one of the main characters *hint hint*), Dawn of the Dead, even freaking Macross - just seeing an anime paying hommage and also straight-up getting inspirations from these things is amazing and shows an ammount of effort and fanboydom I completely feel at home with.\\n\\n\r\nSo, if you like your dark fantasy action with a humorous edge and if you wanna feel like you're watching Lodoss War or Scrapped Princess (or any 90s-fantasy anime of your liking) all over again - give this one a watch, guys. Seriously, Bahamut needs a lot more love.",

            "content": "It's always a rare thing that an anime can pull me in the story with full force, probably because i'm a person with very specifics tastes and when something doesn't enthrall me at all, it won't defintely. \r\nShingeki no Bahamut did much more than that: It sucked me first in to the story, which was very good and not so difficult to follow.   Its a fantasy story packed with action, mithological deities and emotions, primarly loyalty and friendship. The  screenplay is solid and never failed to bore me in any way, and the thing that amazed me most was the transitions betweenscenes which were perfectly smooth and placed at the right time! Obviously the story has its stale moments too, but in 12 episodes the screenwriters wrapped it up in a very good and personally satisfying manner.   It may not be the most oringial plot ever, but the way it is delivered is worth the effort to watch it!\\n\\n\r\nArt and animation is gorgeous, perhaps one of the most beautiful art i've ever seen in an anime before. Face details and expressions fit every character shown, and they are depicted in a very good way.  The show sometimes relies heavily on CGI, but i didn't find it cringy like other animes i've watched in the past  maybe because it is based on an exisisting game and the director chose not to fucked it up too much.\\n\\n\r\nSound is outstanding, YES!  I adored the opening, which is heavy metal based, and the rest of the episodes which are mostly orchestrated in a movie-like way.  Cannot say more, but trust me it is frigging epic.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the characters, the three main protagonists alone are exceptional.  Side characters are well constructed too, and they mainly help shape the story until the very end.  The personalities of the main protagonists evolves in a natural and absolutely not cliched way,  and they deliver very well-written dialogues and motives for every action taken, be malicious or pleasent.\\n\\n\r\nI binge watched the episodes in only 2 days maybe, and loved every piece of the show.  I think Shingeki no Bahamut shines in many many ways, foremost trying to be not pretentious and helping you realize that emotions are the core of everything.   At least, that's what i think. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

Also there is a dragon which everyone is scared of and a war between demons and angels (gods). So that\u2019s pretty much the story in the shortest way I could possibly explain.\r\nAnimation is done by MAPPA back in 2008 which was the time when it was hit or miss for them but this is definitely a hit in the animation department. Sound design is good, OST fit the worldand scenes pretty well. Just too bad the opening is a bit over the top. The best part of this anime is the rivalry between the two main characters, one is a happy go lucky guy who does what he wants when he wants and will lie though his teeth to get that and the other is a knights son who is the living embodiment of a gentleman. So you can see that it\u2019s no surprise these two characters do not get on.\\n\\n\r\nBoth of them get mixed up in said war against their will and that\u2019s pretty much it. I don\u2019t want to say much more, it\u2019s definitely worth the watch if fantasy action is your thing. The happy go lucky main character is pretty funny at times. Yeah I would say its worth the watch, which is surprising as anime based off video games tend to sway to the worse side of things more than the good.\\n\\n\r\n8/10\\n",

            "content": "Shingeki no Bamut: Genesis is an inclusive anime from get the beginning or so it seemed. At the start I was expecting nothing more the a bland, compressed, with nothing new to offer. I\u2019m glad to say I was proven but the anime upbringing and charms. Having no adaption manga, it would be though to be an original anime but in fact it takes after game for its source. However, you\u2019ll be in for a pleasant surprise.\r\nStory: 7\r\nAfter an ongoing war between angels and demons our takes us few hundred/thousands of years into the future. Meet on of our three main protagonist Leone Favaro abounty living each day as if it were his last just barely escaping the capture Kaisar Lidfald, a knight as well as our second main protagonist. Anyhow, Leone is currently on quest in tracking down a bounty, with much charm and magic involve, Leone makes his capture seem like daily routine. Leone bounty is captured onto stone tablet with its face plastered like a card.\\n\\n\r\nHow does one celebrate such a success? Drinking at tavern until the peak of the moon night. Charming his ways with his money and good look Leone is able to catch the attention of two one who listen to his tales. Eventually, mentioning that he knows to get to \u2018Helheim\u2019 quickly. Overhearing this our last protagonist Amira hears this. When Leone makes his leave out of the tavern with his two lovely ladies, he\u2019s stop in his tracks by none other than Amira. Their conversation is cut short due to another bounty presents itself, it\u2019s the younger brother of the bounty Leone captured earlier. \\n\\n\r\nUnderestimating his power Leone is outmatched and quickly defeated. Amira quickly deposes of him, but not as one would expect, it appears that she has the ability of a demon. In order to ensure to Amira route to Helheim, she kisses the unconscious Leone, bidding him to contract. When he wakens at Inn, bare naked he quickly catch of glimpse of his behind to see a devil tail growing out of it. Thus beginnings our adventure and journey to Helheim.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound: 6 | 6\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is sound to astonishing only when it comes down to the more intense fight scenes or action scenes. I\u2019m particular fond of Leone and Amiri tavern music between the two, were they find themselves dancing to. Animation wise is gorgeous, when the characters stand back to catch a glimpse of the landscape it\u2019s as if you were staring at desktop background of your choosing. I find all the characters very unique looking especially Leone scar that stretches down his face, it shows the life of a bounty hunter. There is one downside though Kaisar, I can\u2019t tell but the CGI models of him seem to stick out, other than that it\u2019s implemented well at times. The opening really throws one off with the \u2018Hard Rock\u2019 or \u2018Punk Rock\u2019 music doesn\u2019t seem fit tone, although it grows on you over time. The ED isn\u2019t too much special even more plain that the OP.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7\\n\\n\r\nLeone Favaro \u2013 Charming and appealing is one the many skills and assest a bounty hunter has in order to get what he wants. When it comes Leone it\u2019s obvious he puts himself over others being deceitful to Amira in other to snatch a kiss from her. Even mention to the Royal Knights that she\u2019s a demon all for some ransom money. He\u2019s a guy with intentions for himself always come first but has a change of heart later on.\\n\\n\r\nKaisar Lidfard \u2013 Coming from a wealthy and honorable family. However, he\u2019s forced to make a living a bounty hunter, something he\u2019s not to found off and disgraceful to his family name and honor in the eyes of others. Kaisar is on the hunt of Leone wanting revenge on the man. A man with a code and honor to defend.\\n\\n\r\nAmira \u2013 She\u2019s the quite one that doesn\u2019t like to converse much with others, though things change when she meets Leone, becoming more outspoken and charming. Receiving a major wardrobe change, she doesn\u2019t know much of the current era she\u2019s living in. It\u2019s through Leone that she learns what stars are and much. No question she\u2019s a demon but one that\u2019s on the look for her mother that the sole purpose of her journey to Helheim.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\\n\r\nShingeki no Bahamut: Genesis at the start is plain and indifferent, it\u2019s in episode two the characters quickly grow on you and you find yourself watching the anime because of them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall thoughts/Conclusion: 6\\n\\n\r\nDisappointed with Shingeki no Bahamut, it was cluttered with a bunch of tropes and very jam packed first episode with huge info dump, in order to set up the story. By episode two I\u2019d say is where it found the right pacing and made the story and characters to fun to watch. They all quickly come on their own and are all very unique, that's what made better. It does get a bit rough through the half point, many events are ongoing and many characters a thrown in our direction without breaks. It's plot twist after plot twist, just in hope astonish us with little for us to care for the newer introduced characters that come into play.",

            "content": "Coming into this anime I didn't know what to expect- honestly I figured I probably shouldn't expect a whole heck of a lot- but I was pleasantly surprised by the many things RoBG does right. Not a perfect show by any means, RoBG does enough things right to make it a ride worth taking that I think most anime watchers will enjoy.\r\nArt-\r\nThis is a relatively modern anime and it is very nice visually. It's crisply and vibrantly animated, animations are fluid throughout (which is a huge plus for an anime loaded with fast moving action scenes) and the aesthetic design choices are very fitting forthe story this anime wants to tell. At no point was my jaw on the floor at the sheer beauty of any given scene, but I was definitely impressed and found it nice to look at throughout.\\n\\n\r\nSound-\\n\\n\r\nBrina Palencia, Tia Ballard, Christopher Sabat and other huge names in the voice acting world lend their efforts to the Dub (which is what I watched) and it's really hard to go wrong with that kind of talent in your corner. The voice acting here is top notch and gets a perfect score or damn close to it as far as I'm concerned. The voice acting for this particular anime probably wasn't easy either as so many of the characters are super quirky and this anime brilliantly switches from something humorous to something serious in a blink.\\n\\n\r\nThe music throughout was fine and that's about it. I liked the ending credits song for sure, though I didn't care for the intro song. None of the background tracks particularly stood out to me, for better or for worse. It just felt very average. There isn't any track I'll still remember three months after watching this anime or would add to my personal playlist.\\n\\n\r\nSound effects were crisp and believable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter/Story-\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is extremely character/story driven and for such a short anime (only 12 episodes) there are a lot of important characters who genuinely matter as far as the bigger picture plot is concerned. I feel they did as good a job as anyone could realistically do in developing these characters and making me care about them with such a low episode count, but ultimately there is a limit to how far that can go without more time. All four of the main leads have very different quirks and personalities and they're all quite likable in their own ways.\\n\\n\r\nAs an avid competitive Shadowverse player it was really weird to me, and not in a good way, to see Shadowverse characters included in this anime. I understand why they're there (Cygames, the company that makes Shadowverse, is heavily tied into this anime as well) but it felt more weird and awkward than it did cool. It was hard for me to take those characters seriously or care about them as much. This is one design decision I didn't care for.\\n\\n\r\nThe story here is pretty good and it keeps you guessing all the way til the end, but the ending itself was really disappointing. It was very predictable and cookie cutter and it felt rushed.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-\\n\\n\r\nWith the fast pace and high volume of action in this anime combined with likable, quirky leads this anime gets high marks for enjoyment/entertainment value. As stated previously, the ending wasn't satisfactory to me and felt rushed and I think this anime would have been better with an episode count closer to 16, but it was a nice ride for what it was.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-\\n\\n\r\nRage of Bahamut Genesis does a lot of things right- It's a proper adventure that is fast paced and has action scenes in every episode, the four lead characters are all very quirky and likable in their own way and the voice acting is rock solid. If not for being a few episodes too short and having an extremely safe, cliche, rushed, predictable ending this would be a great show, but as it stands it is merely very good.\\n\\n\r\n+Pretty\\n\r\n+Great voice acting\\n\r\n+Original story + plot twists\\n\r\n+Quirky, likable leads who didn't remind me of leads from any other anime\\n\\n\r\n-Disappointing ending\\n\r\n-Too few episodes\\n\r\n-Awkward inclusion of Shadowverse characters\\n\\n\r\nOBJECTIVE RATING- 8\\n\r\nPERSONAL ENJOYMENT RATING- 8",

Everything else was pretty nice, animation was ok, proportions were great. I barely saw any misdrawn faces and the action scenes can be quite intense. The environment however, was beautiful, and it was probably my favourite aspect of the artwork of this show.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was.... average. However, I can say that the opening theme saved the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 6\\n\\n\r\nI found the characters to be uninteresting and unrealistic (apart from the zombie girl). However, I really enjoyed the way that they interacted with each other. Not much development happened but I might just miss them now.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 4\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, the most important part of watching anything. You should enjoy it before you critically review it. Sadly, I didn't enjoy the show and half of it just felt like I was sitting through class. Actually, I would have rather studied for maths than watched some parts of the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 6\\n\\n\r\nYeah, it wasn't too good. But it is definitely worth a watch.",

It certainly had potential to take many exciting paths, but opted for safer less-than-exciting routes.\r\nArt (8): \r\nI personally liked the art. It had enough detail to look rich and the colors were fresh. The animation was very good too, and didn't disappoint in the action scenes.\r\nSound (6):\r\nThis is the least interesting part of this anime for me. Soundtrack was nothing special, and sometimes it even annoyed me a bit. \r\nCharacter (8):\r\nThecharacters are really interesting and don't follow the annoying/overused tropes. There's also a good dynamic between them that'll entertain. \\n\r\nEnjoyment (7): I enjoyed the anime quite a bit. It was far from a masterpiece, but had a lot of good moments.\\n\r\nOverall (7.5): Action anime lovers who want to see something different, unique and interesting should check Shingeki no Bahamut. While it may not be an excellent series, it has a lot of enjoyable moments that'll keep watchers interested until the very end.",

            "content": "When I first saw the preview for the season, hearing that there was going to be an anime based on a smart phone game, I dismissed it as a cash grab, seeing as most games on smart phones are either scams or cash grabs. However, after the first episode there was a fair amount of hype for the show, so I decided to join the crowd and give it a watch. To my surprise, Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis was a pleasant experience. But there is one aspect of the show that holds it back; time.\r\nThe first episode does well to draw the audience in tothe world of Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis. The goal of the show is made apparent within the first few scenes; Bahamut, a dangerous dragon-like monster may come back one day to destroy the world. The main characters are then introduced in a well choreographed battle across a medieval town. The visuals and the music of the battle give a strong sense of adventure and fun and primes the audience for what's ahead. Quickly after the introduction of Amira, the story is set as the characters embark on their journey across this interesting world.\\n\\n\r\nSadly though, the journey doesn't last long. Within six episodes the main characters are back at the beginning and the show starts building up to its climax. This, perhaps, stems from the fact that Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis was only given 12 episodes to tell its full story. The beginning of the show gives a feeling similar to Lord of the Rings or Avatar the Last Airbender; the characters are going to explore the world, learning along the way before leading to the climax where everything comes together. However, the show only gives a teaser of its world. This leads to a fairly mediocre conclusion where scenes that should be emotional instead feel forced and lack any weight. The time constraint issues affect the pacing too. Battles go faster than they should, time within the show moves quickly and there are very few scenes that actually allow time for the audience to absorb the gravity of what's going on. This also negatively affects the character and plot development, speeding through scenes to get to the next plot point. \\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, there are plenty of memorable moments along the way to keep the audience entertained. The characters are interesting and their interactions are genuinely delightful to watch. The action is done well enough together with the soundtrack. The comedy mostly hits the mark and doesn't harm the tone of the show. The story doesn't leave any questions unanswered either.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis is an anime that I wish had more time given to it. I wanted to know more about the world. I wanted to see the characters go through many different towns and scheme their way through various situations. I wanted more time to grow attached to the characters and understand the  gravity of the impending release of Bahamut. Instead, what the anime ended up being was a teaser for what could have been. Still, if people want to give this show a go I would recommend watching it. But, perhaps put other better shows as a higher priority.\\n",

I haven't listen to such a good Reggae Rock band aftee skindred back in need for speed Underground 2. The rythm is just damn outstanding and the lyrics are so deep and accurate jeez I LOVE IT!\r\nNow the reason behind the score is that SiM never released what we call a \"full version\" and I feel that they could achieve more with this song.\r\n*Ending \"Promised Land\" made by Risa Shimizu (Rating: 8/10)\r\nI'm not really a fan of endings but Promised Land was quite abeautiful song. Like the calm after the storm (starring the opening and the episode as the storm).\\n\\n\r\n*NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT THE CONTENT\\n\\n\r\nThis anime gave the mainstream anime artstyle a kick in the nuts. AND I'M GLAD THEY DID because I wanted to watch something different.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy was really good, Favaro Leone should be a jester not a bounty hunter. The funny moves, the comments, his expression and thoughts he makes when his lies fails and his quote \"Do I look like a lier to you!?\" Along with that creepy grin at the end was just priceless.\\n\\n\r\nKaisar Lidford a.k.a \"HammerHead\": the comedian's assistant nuff said.\\n\\n\r\nAmira a.k.a \"The badass beauty\": Amira is a really beautiful and innocent character while Demon Amira is BADASS INCARNATE. Her development during the second half was a little dissapointing though. But I still love her!\\n\\n\r\nRita a.k.a \"The zombie with a dick personality\": I LOVE HER I LOVE HER I LOVER HER!!!! She doesn't hesitate on making mean comments, slapping her friends or even pull of the feathers of a god yet this is her way of showing her love to the people she care about and I love her so much because I really feel identified with this kind of character.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is awesome yet a little to be desired at the end.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways even with these little flaws I mentioned during the review. YOU MUST WATCH IT!",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS but warning: this anime is too damn predictable you can just don t worry about that ;)\r\nI had great expectations from this anime since i saw an Amv from youtube and i was stunned by its graphic so let s start off.\r\nWatching this anime is like climbing a stair,each step an episode so you start with the first, 2 3 4 and it s ok then you start falling down without realizing it and the reason behind that is the presence of Big plot holes.Maybe i m just too obsessed by details but as a serious anime viewer i can't toleratesome kind of things ...cause the more accurate the details are and the more you can enjoy a tv series and distinguish the real masterpieces. That said i ll show you what i mean for 'details'.For example, in one of the first scene the 2 main characters jump with their horses from a bridge up to the roof of some houses.. (I guess 40 m high)and keep their racing like nothing happened..Just Wow i didn t know horses were so hardy, but they would be dead in real life lol..these are the things wich bother me considerably but since it was just the first mins i let it pass so 3 eps moved almost perfectly and then a huge s**tstorm covered me unexpectedly.\\n\r\nWhy? From what has started with a normal and pleasant series the anime quickly transform into a supermega trash wich can make envy the unfamous Sharknado.i m not kidding let me explain..\\n\r\n'Predictable' become the key-word of every episode but in a way so Heavy that you want almost drop this series or finish it as fast as you can..the battle with Blackbeard who patiently wait for the Mc rises instead of instant-shooting and kill him or the kraken (which was headshotted by the demon girl) wich magically appears in the exactly moment when the captain was falling into the sea .-. Some directorial choices are just appalling.\\n\r\nThis anime also presents one of the most ILLOGICAL scene that i ve ever seen in my entire life.. At the end the antagonist Belzebub succeed his evil plan and summon the invincible Bahamut for (guess what?) rule the world. (np with that, it s just the villain complex)He orders the dragon to defeat all the gods he s fighting, so he charges his hyperbeam and ... (Moment of silence)incenerate Belzebub...... ....... .......*Guffaw* Lool You don t say???It was f***ing predictable omg.. He has the power to destroy the world.WTF were you thinking when you realized your plan? Are you an idiot?It s been thousand of ages bahamut is trying to destroy everything and only with the desperate help of all the Earth creatures (god, demons, angels, humanity) they could just sealed untill that moment.. Try to tame it was the WORST idea that a villain could ever think...\\n\r\nBy the way at the end the Bahamut explodes with the power of an atomic bomb and the main character Favaro, who was up to his eye he gets along with only a leg less.HOW? Holy **** Don t try to say he was a demon because it s been said many times that his demon tail was only a curse but for the rest he was a human so speechless..\\n\r\nBtw I will not describe every single bulls**t i saw or my review will become too long so let s get this over.\\n\r\nIf i could describe this anime in poor words i d say \"all smoke and no fire\"so dear Bahamut, u made a s**t figure lol.If you are not looking into a big story or not expect too much from a series then you will enjoy it..my score is just a gift for the art and animation wich you can see miles away they put a lot of efforts in it.",

            "content": "Coming right from Cygames is the finally released \"Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis\" or as it is known in the card game rpg world, \"Rage of Bahamut.\"\r\nTo give a little background info, \"Rage of Bahamut\" is a card game that is produced by Cygames that this anime series is based off. I will dive further into the anime being based off the card game, but the rpg game isn't too bad. Check it out if you have the time!\r\nAnyways, a story of a young man helping a girl get to someplace and fight off enemies on the way there. That's the series in a nutshell andI'd say it sounds pretty generic or general for anime now, but here are my thoughts on it. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe storyline is quite simple, which allows for more wiggle room for action and humour and lots of other add-ons to make it interesting. Like I said, it's an adventure of getting someone from one place to another because of some wish the person wants. Pretty normal, but one things SnB really excels at is progress. It does not lag behind for the sake of superfluous action or forced comedy and it progresses very well.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nHmm. From a card game, I would expect a lot for art and I do have to say that from the first 2 episodes I was not very impressed by the artwork. However, it does progressively get better as they reveal more characters. The human character designs are quite normal and do not interest me much, but SnB does a fine job in detailing the demons and angels' designs. Very nice touch.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSnB does an excellent job in sound! The opening \"Existence\" is very metal and rock which just resonates how this anime is an action/adventure! What really draws me in is the OSTs in battle. Now this is one of the epitomes of SnB. Very nice OSTs that compliment the battle scenes and action scenes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOriginal is not a word I would use, yet they are unique! Their designs are okay in terms of unoriginality, but their traits are what enhances them the most! Very dynamic characters and very big cast full of interesting creatures! Yes, there are angels, dragons, demons, dragoons, zombies, and many others that may sound staple, but there are qualities that make them undeniably great.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe first 2 episodes made me question my interest, but after the 4/5th, I was happy to say that i liked it and I will continue watching it. Every episode has its own uniqueness to it, so it does not just copy one episode or just recap everything.\\n\\n\r\nParallel to Game\\n\\n\r\nThis is where I want to point out my opinion. RoB and SnB is in the medieval times of 3 realms, humans, gods, and demons! However, I was not expecting a somewhat new cast and even a different \"mechanism.\" I was hoping for some mechanisms (like Holy Wars/Evolution/Castle Crushers) to be incorporated formally. Nevertheless, the anime was not disappointing and is still well done!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Very nice anime with a sluggish start. The episodes get better and the most recent episode (episode 7) was just amazing and I would say the apex of the last 7 episodes. I recommend this to people who play Rage of Bahamut (free to play in the App Store!) or people who enjoy watching action/adventure/thrillers as well as rpg-players since the setting is really rpg-like! 8/10 in total! Give SnB some more love guys! :D\\n",

ME. AWAY. It wasn't so much about the story itself (although there were many parts I didn't see coming and I really did enjoy the story as a whole!) but how our heroes got to the end. \r\nThis anime is stunning to watch. The main characters are fantastic, well-rounded and thoroughly engaging. There are dragons, demons, gods, angels and that's only someof it, I don't want to spoil the rest for anyone, but there really is more. The best part is it does't feel like a horrible mish-mash of differing fantasy genres (and a hint of sci-fi too), instead it all blends together seamlessly in a fantastical world I have always wanted to see. \\n\\n\r\nThere is the odd point that just didn't make 100% sense (such is the way with anime and the fantasy genre in general), and one or two points which could have been lingered over just a bit longer (maybe 13 episodes instead of 12?), but those are truly minuscule setbacks which take away none of the enjoyment of this anime. \\n\\n\r\nIt's become an instant favourite of mine and there was always at least one point in each episode where I literally went 'woah' either at the pretty or at the cleverness of some of the storyline. I loved every second.\\n\\n\r\nThis is fantasy done right.",

            "content": "Imagine having just a card game as source material for an action, adventure, fantasy anime you have to make. MAPPA studios took that challenge and turned a battle card game with no more source material than some conceptual artwork and with as much plot as a cardboard game can have, into a really good anime that even had potential for a masterpiece. I am talking about the 2014 anime, Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis, also known as Rage of Bahamut and here is the review to it. Enjoy!\r\nPLOT AND STORY LINE\r\nShingeki no Bahamut is set in an alternative version of medieval France in a world whereevery possible fantasy creature exists. The story sets off with an old tale about the ancient dragon Bahamut that brought about destruction to the land of Mistarcia two thousand years ago. Only by working together, the gods and demons were able to save the world, sealing the dragon away and creating a key to keep him imprisoned forever. They key was split into two halves, one being kept by each deity, but the long lasting peace would again be threatened after one of the halves gets stolen. In a world that is about to face new danger we meet our two protagonists-the bounty hunters Favaro and Kaisar who, in terms of personality, couldn't be more different. The bounty haunting life that they knew would soon be over after Favaro accidently meets a mysterious woman that goes by the name Amira. \\n\r\nNow, the story itself sounds promising and is really intriguing but for some reason I found it rather boring in the beginning. It is in the second half where the anime finally drew my full attention to the story. The second half puts all the pieces together and you finally understand what is going on. Moreover, new plot twists and surprises are just the beginning of the excitement as the anime slowly moves towards its huge finale. Amazing battles, emotional background stories and character side stories are just some of the elements that turned Shingeki no Bahamut into a really good anime in the end. And when it comes to the first half, I would have probably dropped the anime if it weren't for that one story element-the relationship between Favaro and Kaiser.\\n\r\nEven though the story does have its ups and downs, it is the two protagonists that actually keep your attention, especially in the beginning. The story element of two characters that hate each other, yet are obliged to work together, never gets old and in case of Shigeki no Bahamut it definitely contributes to its entertainment factor. The way their contradictory personalities interact keeps the anime amusing and always open for new surprises. What's more, an interesting background story about Favaro and Kaiser is woven into the main story as it reveals the true reason for their everlasting fight and hatred.\\n\r\nIn short, you might find the story of Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis hard to follow in the beginning, but I promise you an entertaining and slightly emotional story full of action and amazing fights later on. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\r\nIf there is one thing that Shingeki no Bahamut did without a single flaw, then it is the characters. The character design is so remarkable and unique, and even though I am not a huge fan of the style I have to praise MAPPA for their outstanding work. But the thing that was even better than that was the fact that each character actually had a distinctive personality. \\n\r\nThe personalities of the main characters are of course the most noticeable ones, especially when it comes to Favaro and Kaiser. Favaro is a carefree bounty hunter that finds the purpose in life in three things alone: money, women and wine. Lies and scams are part of his everyday life whereas his life-moto would be his father's quote: \u201eWhich way is the wind blowing? To tomorrow! \u201c. Kaiser, on the other hand, is a very serious and mature young man that also lives the life of a bounty hunter. Noble by birth, Kaiser was once a knight and so he still behaves, all according to the codex of knighthood. Amira, the leading female is a naive, sweet and rather childish young girl that is not truly aware of her powers. She was definitely one of my favorites form the show and it was her character design on the anime cover that drew my attention to Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis in first place.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION AND STYLE\\n\r\nJust as I said before, one of the greatest things about the anime is definitely its style. Both the setting and character design are amazing and more importantly distinctive among other anime. One thing I did have a problem with was the animation. All in all, it was not bad, but it lacked in contrast. The heaven scenes were too bright, the demon scenes were to dark and in some parts you just couldn't clearly see what was going on. The quality of the animation was mediocre in my opinion, but I have to say that it was still enjoyable to watch. \\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION\\n\r\nEven though Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis is solely based on a battle card game, the anime had potential to turn into a masterpiece. Unfortunately, it didn't come to that. The lack of excitement in the beginning and the flaws in the animation made the anime less enjoyable but it is nevertheless a really good anime that is worth your time. What saves the anime is definitely its intriguing historical-fantasy setting and the quality of the characters. Simply put, Shingeki no Bahamut might not be a masterpiece but it still deserves to be part of the completed section on your anime list. \\n",

Now it is time to ooze into this spoilery review. \r\nRage of Bahamut Genesis is fun, and for an anime adaptation of a videogame it is pretty darn special. There are moments where the animation is truly mind blowing, the first episode being a fantastic over the top introduction to the style and the characters. Where Bahamut struggles is a feeling of consistency, the characters start out doing odd jobs going after bounties, then they are havinga dramatic sea battle, then they are dealing with demons is a floating Cthulhu fortress, then they are bumming around a castle oh wait now they are engaged in defending the castle from a demonic onslaught, now they are in an alternate dimension chatting up a dragon, and now there is a demonic insurrection. A sizable issue is the a main villain that feels underwhelming as their motives are unknown and their character has been playing a very reserved role up until now but suddenly is crazy? The world doesn't feel very realized as it pulls from way to many areas at once, for example they keep referencing Satan but honestly he played little to no role in the show. The magic system is also a problem as the show tries to place dramatic weight on magical actions being taken, but you never know how powerful any given beam of magic light is supposed to be as it all starts to blend together after awhile. It makes up for its scattered world and narrative by having a fun cast of zany characters that, for the most part, remain consistent. If you are willing to overlook some crazy plot and magic conveniences than Rage of Bahamut Genesis can be an entertaining adventure to follow.   \\n",

            "content": "This is a rare high quality high budget anime, which reminded me of masterpiece titles like Samurai Champloo or Cowboy Bebop. Over the course of the story, it manages to unfold a story that is bigger than heroes involved, and displays complex and convoluted world with a large number of characters and beings inspired by or based on real world legends and even occasional historical figure. It is a very solid show that is worth watching... but somehow it doesn't reach that quality bar where you could call it a masterpiece, even though all the elements seems to be here. \r\nDetailed breakdown below:\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nAside froma very small number of highly cliched stereotypical story turns, it is fairly solid and interesting to watch. The show managed to properly keep the events going, unfolding into something bigger and bigger, it also managed to paint the main threat in the show in proper manner - where you can't just dismiss it as a plot device and feel a bit f respect to it. The story has that slight issue where it is occasionally quite obvious that some events happen to impress the viewer (i.e. you see few events as plot devices), but that doesn't happen very often. The story is very solid.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10:\\n\r\nHigh quality art with nice character designs. There are different kind of fantastic creatures, some of which are huge, and there are bunch of very nice looking/beautiful  characters of each gender. The issue with art is that the anime uses a lot of CG (it couldn't happen without it, to be honest), and CG is noticeable. It isn't UGLY kind of CG (like those horrible monsters in Ga Rei Zero, for example), but there's a noticeable contrast between hand-drawn frames and CG-rendered backgrounds and creatures, which is very obvious.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10:\\n\r\nSound is good, with many great musical themes that were supposed to feel epic. The probelm is that while they were interesting to listen to, I felt like the music coudl use more punch in it, especially those tracks with choir that is supposed to be awe-inspiring. I felt that music, despite being good, fell short in many battles. Intro soundtrack was great, though.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5/10:\\n\r\nThe story mostly revolves around the world and the thread, and not about characters, meaning they don't really have much chance to fully display their characters/personalities. Characters coudl definitely use more depth, because at times they almost look like plot devices that are supposed to do this or that thing, rather than people. Still, main heroine was quite interesting to watch....\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10:\\n\r\nI liked it. I liked the way events kept unfolding, and how this anime kept displaying different aspects of the world, shifting perspectives and in the end giving a big picture of the strange realm where the events happen. It doesn't reach its full potential, but it was better than I expected.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10:\\n\r\nHighly recommended to check it out. While it may not qualify for a \"masterpiece\" level material, this kind of solid work is uncommon.",

I can say it is worth watching and watching dubbed at least in English.  No idea who they got to voice him but the sames joke told in subbed were a \"ow that is cute/quaint\" but indubbed with his tone is just makes it for me.

I personally do not like the adventure genre but would still definitely recommend it it's shining points surpass its little flaws.\r\n\u2800\u2800 The first few minutes into the series is a little overwhelming with it just throwing you in to what SNBG is, but it definitely makes up for it explaining everything by the end. Demons and Angels are the gods of this world. While our protagonists are mostly human, the main spotlight is on thesetwo different groups during the action sequences. The animation really shines here from Mappa showing how overpowered these Angles and Demons are. \\n\r\n\u2800\u2800 \u2800\u2800The soundtrack was nice definitely adding a lot to the overall feel during action sequences. But I found myself forgetting most of it, as the action on screen was overpowering it sorry Ike Yoshihiro.  I need a stronger chorus to support the action. \u2800\u2800\u2800\\n\r\n\u2800\u2800I generally like the plot of SNBG and don't really have any complaints about it. But I definitely am disappointed with the antagonists, they didn't explain really any of their motives. There was a lot of villains but where's their insides? Cerberus was probably the most unloved character, she started as a piece of cardboard and that's how she ended. Unfortunately that's how most of the supporting characters are treated throughout. The main antagonist just wanted world domination for the sake of world domination. Blah blah I rest my case.\\n\r\n\u2800\u2800Even with the poor supporting characters I still recommend this series, It's a thrill ride of a good adventure series done right.",

            "content": "Personal Rate: 6\r\nAverage Rate based on the different criteria: 6.4 rounded down to 6\r\nI came to watch this anime without knowing it was an adaptation from a card game. Overall, let's just say that it feels incredibly rushed and overall I just couldn't get as invested as I wish I had. The problem probably stems from the wide array of characters depicted... If the series had mostly focused on Favaro and Kaisar, I guess it would have made for a fairly enjoyable ride... instead I just got bored senseless.\r\nStory: 5\r\nArt: 9\r\nSound:  6\r\nCharacter: 6\r\nEnjoyment: 6\r\nOverall: 6\r\nStory: 5\r\nObviously given the short length, the story is prettystraightforward... and it would not have been a problem if it had been character driven but we're shown a whole bunch of things which I guess will appeal to original fans of the game but which only adds to a feeling of confusion overall. Had the story not bothered with useless detours and focused more on the mains, it would have been a pleasant ride in spite of the empty plot.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\\n\r\nTop notch. Totally gorgeous. In fact, I started this anime for the art I stumbled upon surfing on the web. Apart from Cerberus which character design seems to be straight out of a bad bdsm hentai, it is a feast for the eyes. Favaro in particular has one of the most ridiculous haircut I ever saw in an anime and still manages to rock it like it's the coolest thing ever. I mean, gosh, he looks cool. The same can be said about the other characters (except Rita but again she's got the body of a child) but Favaro is to me certainly one of the most gorgeous character design I had the chance to see. The action scenes are well executed as well but minus 1 point for the use of 3D which doesn't always looks as integrated as it should with the 2D elements.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\\n\r\nIt's okay but totally forgettable. I doubt I can remember any theme song I heard watching it. In fact, it is so bland, It sounds like any average fantasy music ever... Only exception to the rule is the hard metal opening which made my ears bleed - not my thing at all. I heard it twice because man does the opening looks cool and fit well with the music, but then I decided I'd spare my sensitive ears and skip it altogether. \\n\r\nThe ending, is your classic ballad, forgettable but at least you won't become deaf listening to it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\\n\r\nToo many. Again as said above, it's probably a tribute to fans of the game but if you never played it, you'll have trouble getting attached to any of them. Only characters we spend more time on are Kaisar and Favaro but it still is not enough. Both are drawn being the typical rival/friend/antagonist but the depth of their relationship though hinted at is not highlighted enough for us to care. Then there's this whole bunch of characters whether demons, humans or angels thrown in the mix which motivations apart from preventing bahamut's wake and staying alive for some, is obscure. The worst is when you get to the end of the series and you get these twists but you're not given a chance to know why the hell this character did that and if he/she did, err, who are they really?\\n\r\nThis had to do more with the length... A bit more time spent with each of them would have been great at least to understand their motivations.\\n\r\nUnfortunately with 12 episodes, they can only be classified into two groups: \"Save the world\" or \"Rule the world\".  No gray area there.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\\n\r\nFavoro+ Kaisar + Amira: YAY\\n\r\nRest: Bleh\\n\\n\r\nThe action scenes especially towards the end are so long that I ultimately got bored. I didn't even want to bother.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\\n\r\nShingeki no Bahamut Genesis is an ok anime. But great animation can't save empty characters and confusing plot. It lacks soul. This being said, if you've got  time to waste, it's not a  bad deal. If you're busy with life and don't want to start an addicting anime, this one is pretty cool. It's got action, likable mains and the scenario is so predictable, you won't be hung on the cliffhangers... This being said, I think I'll give the second season a chance since it's got twice the amount of episodes. I'm hoping the increasing length will work in their favor.",

            "content": "SMALL SPOILERS BELOW!!!\r\nFirst of all I would like to say that I had heard very little about this series when it first came out besides knowing it is based off a mobile card game. My initial thoughts were is it just another one of those mobile based card games that I could easily brush off to the side without a second though which I did. \r\nHowever as one of my good friends had completed the show he suggested I check it out and give it a go. So why not, going into it I was really surprised at how great it turned out as Iwas launched right into an adventure with our protagonists and seeing their journey from one location to the next. The action is spectacular and the comedy here and there is always fun to watch. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIn the past the dragon (Bahamut) came close to destroying the whole world. However with the humans, gods and demons working together they were able to seal the beast and split the key into two parts so that they would never be connected again to prevent Bahamut from reviving once more. Many years later a girl named Amira stole one of the keys and from here on is where the adventure begins. This may sound generic, but the execution of how it is portrayed is what I found to be enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nSometimes it felt like I was watching a movie due to how fast the pacing went which was actually a good thing in some parts.  \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI found the art to be done very well and beautifully. The animation on certain monsters was done quite well, even when they were 3DCGI I found them to be menacing and the detail on them is very nice. The scenery and background I just loved as it is really reminiscent of a fantasy type anime. I was amazed at how good the animation was especially when this was based off a card game. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI found the opening Song \"EXiSTENCE\" by SiM a fantastic way to get you pumped and excited heading into each episode. The scenes where there was a massive battle occurring felt like something big was going to happen which the music complimented it very well. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI am going to mention the four main characters/protagonists of the series.  \\n\\n\r\nFavaro is a bounty hunter that goes around claiming bounties which he spends on alcohol, food and women. He is often silly and the face he makes when he is trying to be serious is quite funny. In terms of skill and combat he is a competent fighter who is good at using a sword and always has a trick up his sleeve when in a tight situation. \\n\\n\r\nAmira\u2019s beauty, lovely pink hair and personality is what I like about her character. She is simple-minded and doesn\u2019t seem to know much about the world around her. She loves to eat and is usually the only thing she thinks about. Her demon form when I first saw it is freaking awesome and the way she fights is glorious to see. She is someone you don\u2019t want to mess with.\\n\\n\r\nKaiser was once a noble knight. However an incident involving his father led them to losing their titles and since then has become a bounty hunter like Favaro. \\n\\n\r\nRita the zombie girl I would say is my favorite out of the four. She is a necromancer who has the ability to control the dead. However she is bitten and later on becomes a zombie, but stills has the ability to think for herself. I love how she is always calm around the other three and likes to break up situations, especially when Favaro and Kaiser get into fights. Her powers are quite handy and can definitely turn the tables against an opponent. With one bite she is able to take full control of anything living or dead. You would think when watching her interact with the others she doesn\u2019t seem to really care about them, but in actual fact she is always looking out for them and is always keeping an eye on her surroundings. I am also a big fan of Sawashiro, Miyuki who voices here so that was an added bonus. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed this show a lot more than I should have. The action was fantastic especially the massive battles that occurred every so often. I loved the characters. Each of them had a unique charm about them which I found enjoyable to watch while getting to know them.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nA great fantasy anime with plenty of action and adventure in only 12 episodes that I would recommend to anyone. A straight forward story, but the way it was done kept me wanting more. You got humans, demons and gods involved, what more could you ask for.",

            "content": "The story is some good ol' fun adventure... At least at first sight, as it is SIGNIFICANTLY deeper than that... 9/10 but it gets 10/10 from the extra points that I wanted to give the characters.\r\nArt and Sound do not even need commentary. 10/10\r\nThe characters... This is probably what made the anime REALLY good, not just good. It deservesd FAR more than 10/10!\r\nEnjoyment, 10/10\r\nOverall, it is the 2nd best or best anime I have ever watched. (Not that I watch a lot of anime, but I have a very high threshold when it comes to even deciding to PEEK AT an anime, so that iswhy I only watched 3 or 4 anime so far.)",
