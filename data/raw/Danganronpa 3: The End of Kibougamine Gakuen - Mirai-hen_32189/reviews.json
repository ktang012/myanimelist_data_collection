            "content": "Danganronpa 3: The End of Kibougamine Gakuen - Mirai-hen Review\r\n_______________________________________________________\r\nI have included a tl;dr near the bottom of this review if the length is too long. \r\nDisclaimer: I have played both the Danganronpa 1 and 2 games to completion and have been following the series for years. (For reference, I would probably give the games about a 6/10) THIS REVIEW WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS FOR THIS SERIES AND MINOR SPOILERS FOR THE GAMES.\r\nIf a mystery is a typical \"whodunnit\" (as DR3 is), it sometimes relies a bit too much on the inevitable twist of the reveal of the culprit. However, it only requires a shift inperspective to create a quality story and to not become another entry into the dreaded \"mystery box\" genre. I have never been the biggest fan of mysteries in general because the mystery alone usually isn't enough to create an engaging narrative, and I feel this is how most genre contemporaries present themselves. Even the ones that don't struggle to make thoroughly enticing mystery-based stories because they usually won't leave much of an impression unless they blow your fucking mind to smithereens. It's a flawed, finicky genre to me because whenever I come across a mystery with decent/good characters, the mysteries always end up lackluster, and vice versa. Basically, the mystery shows I do like have elements that appeal to me other than the feeling of \"Oooh, what's gonna happen?? Maybe something interesting in the future!\" Historically, Danganronpa is a series that tries not to fall into this trap by having a wide array of characters, cool settings, and exciting court cases. I don't think the games are anything special, but they are competent enough to have some fun with. It's when the adaptation of the first Danganronpa game came out that the problems with the story and characters were enhanced twofold and made incredibly apparent. Plot holes arising from removed dialogue, one-note characters who die without garnering any sympathy and poor characterization for the ones that remain alive, mind-boggling pacing, and it just felt like sitting around waiting for interesting things to happen only to realize that they never will. It really sucked. However, after some time passed, Danganronpa 3 was announced. It was touted as a completely original project designed to end the story of the first two games, meaning they had significantly more creative freedom to work with. Gone are the days of attempting to cram 30+ hours of content into 13 regular-sized episodes. Suffice to say, despite its best efforts, Danganronpa 3 Future Arc fails to impress. It so woefully falls flat in every area that it makes the entire series look like a joke, and if this is how the series is going to end, then I am painfully let down. How this has little in the way of negative reviews at the time of this writing and even held an average score above an 8 on MAL (which is what some of my favorites don't even get) for a long period of time makes no sense to me.\\n\\n\r\nAnd yeah, this show falls into every possible trap regarding bad mystery stories. It's boring, spins its wheels, has lame characters, and is ridiculously stupid. However, if it were that simple, I wouldn't be writing this review. I'm going to get to the bottom of the mystery within a mystery: what happened to Danganronpa?\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s begin with talking about the thing that immediately struck me as terrible - the presentation. The color design is truly abysmal, with the dominant colors being black, gray, brown, and a disgusting shade of red that pervades through certain parts. A show so inundated with lifeless scenes of characters standing around talking is bound to be much more interesting with this lovely palette applied. Unfortunately, the area the characters inhabit while standing in a bunch of dark, empty rooms and hallways may be the main culprit of the horrible visual design. Somewhere along the line, I\u2019m sure a decision was made to make Danganronpa 3 \u201cdarker\u201d than previous installments, because it is the conclusion after all. While I believe this only applied in the literal sense with the final product, they did make the blood red, which finally makes Danganronpa the mature series I\u2019ve been waiting for. However, it\u2019s possible that after they spent a hundred painstaking hours using the paint bucket tool on the splashes of blood, they forgot to make the setting something other than a gray mass of boring concrete. While the art design in the Danganronpa games is not exceptional, I at least felt like I \u201cknew\u201d the location I was in, and the scenery was usually quite unique depending on where you were in the school or the island. It's true that this it's easier to evoke this feeling in a game, but it's not unheard of to use directing tricks and good shot composition to communicate the setting through the visuals. but DR3 just doesn't do this. The director, Kishi Seiji, is rather hit-or-miss for me. I don't care for Yuuki Yuuna, Persona 4, Seto no Hanayome, or Carnival Phantasm, and nor did I find the directing in any of those shows particularly standout. But I do like Angel Beats, and Humanity has Declined is one of my favorite shows of all time. Even then, the directing in these shows is one of their weaker elements, especially Humanity has Declined (it's still good, though), which could have benefited from a more unconventional style. Why any of this matters is because I think it proves Seiji alone probably doesn't have the means to salvage a show with a terrible script and weak art direction. The camera angles and constant uses of bland panning shots and character zoom-ins illustrate that Seiji was constricted by the claustrophobic nature of DR3's setting. However, take everything I've said with a grain of salt because I don't believe it's easy to place the blame on anyone involved with an anime's production. To continue a bit further, (this is almost equally the fault of the writing), the sense of space between characters is conveyed so poorly it's practically a non-entity, removing any tension and making the murders that happen unbelievably dull. There's no standout scenery or any kind of important landmarks to help alleviate this, further disengaging me as a viewer. There was a clear lack of creative vision with this show, which is made blindingly obvious through the absence of any cohesiveness or suspense in its presentation. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is not impressive, or fluid in the slightest, even during key moments when characters are fighting or whatever, and I really hate how the lighting is occasionally too dark to clearly see what's going on. I, myself, have never been a huge fan of the DR art style, but even I think that the way it is converted into the anime format looks kind of ugly, especially the characters. I just can't stand their odd face shapes and strangely designed eyes, and this is amplified when they're moving. All of the aforementioned issues with the presentation combine to create a tedious viewing experience that only makes me think about how I could be better using my time. Basically, the idea that anyone can look at this series and get invested even the slightest bit is baffling to me, especially since this atrocious presentation is a pretty big reason that I can barely get through an episode without falling asleep. \\n\\n\r\nThe dialogue is laughably horrific. It's truly devoid of any creativity or flair, and is never enjoyable. Characters (though mostly Munakata) are given bafflingly stupid lines that often made me do a double-take and burst out laughing. I would go out of my way to provide some specific examples, but I don't exactly have the time, and it was something that was just apparent to me all throughout the series. All that results from the poor script is the reinforcement of the vacuous, unenjoyable presentation. And, even though I praised it for being unintentionally funny, whenever the show actually attempts comedy, it always comes up painfully flat. Isn't it hilarious that Naegi's sister might have incestuous feelings for him because that's a thing that's popular in anime right now?? Also, Hagakure's character is intended as comedic relief but, surprise, he just fails hard at it, and since this is his only purpose in the show, it quickly gets on my nerves. This might seem like a pedantic complaint, but I don't think it's necessarily wrong to ask for some kind of self-awareness in the writing, which it \"attempts\" to do, but it comes off as a mere wink and a nod to current trends more so than humor derived from the characters or the situations. Maybe this is because all of the characters are so unimaginably flat that it's hard to write any enjoyable scenes with them? Hmm...no way! Anyway, I always appreciate series that go out of their way to acknowledge their own ridiculousness, but DR3 sucks at doing this, resulting in a never-ending spiral of boredom.\\n\\n\r\nHere's a fun drinking game you can do with the script: take a shot every time a character says \"hope\" or \"despair.\" Actually, to prevent death by alcohol poisoning, you should just pick one of the words and have your buddy take the other. \\n\\n\r\nOh, and the soundtrack, at least from what I can remember, is comprised of reused or slightly remixed songs from the games, so who gives a shit about that. I'm not saying I dislike Danganronpa music, quite the opposite in fact, but the lack of originality just makes it all the more tiring to sit through.  \\n\\n\r\nSo if the series isn't nice to look at and nothing is presented in a compelling way, like, 100% of the time, its characters and plot must make up for it, right?! After all, Welcome to the N.H.K is a series that happens to have notoriously horrible and inconsistent visuals, but it still remains a great show because the other aspects hold it up so well. Now here's a revelation that's as predictable as any plot twist in this anime: this is not the case with DR3.\\n\\n\r\nI want to address my most hated plot device before delving into the characters and overarching story: Forbidden Actions. Here's the rundown: all the characters trapped inside the remains of the Future Foundation building have a cuff around their arms that dictates what actions they cannot see or do, and if they perform or witness said action, they die (almost) instantly. If you fail to comprehend why I believe this is so retarded, then let me explain: this is the writers blatantly including deus ex machinas as a functioning component of the story. By the way, the audience is NOT made aware of every characters' Forbidden Actions, and in fact, viewers are intentionally left in the dark on this. Why? If this was an attempt to add tension, it actually has the opposite effect. There's nothing gratifying whatsoever in learning that someone's Forbidden Action happens to correlate to a scene that that character is a part of. They exist as nothing more than a device to conveniently kill characters whenever the writers think it's \"best\" to do so, which is one of the most obnoxious methods of stringing along that I've ever seen in a mystery story, and it only hurts the anime's endeavor to make me care about what's going on. Surprisingly, even though DR3 is going for a more serious tone, every single time Forbidden Actions are important or even mentioned at all, it results in unintentionally hilarious scenes. Like, holy shit, Naegi's Forbidden Action is that he can't run in the hallway, and he has to piggyback on one of the characters if there's anywhere he wants to go. Hahahaha, what the fuck? One character is killed off early on in order to showcase how deadly these Forbidden Actions can be, but his requirement came off as incredibly forced as a result of this. The chances of said Action not occurring were so low that his death was practically unavoidable. In contrast, I was certain, from the second Naegi's was revealed, that it would never become a problem at any point in the story. Enthralling. \\n\\n\r\nDanganronpa 3's characters were doomed to be fucking awful as soon as it was announced the run time for the series would be 12 episodes. Yeah, good luck developing those 15-20 relevant characters and/or making the audience even remotely care about them when they inevitably die. I guess for a lot of people, the fact that characters die is enough to make them tear up, but I hate any kind of story that hinges on this because it feels manipulative, like the story can't get me naturally endeared to its cast without resorting to sob stories and the constant threat of death. As it stands, DR3's cardboard cutouts masquerading as characters fail to interest or compel me to care. All of them can be boiled down to a single (less than compelling) personality trait, and whenever they try(emphasis on try) to show depth beyond that, they die without accomplishing anything. You know so little about them that whenever the show tries to \"subvert\" your expectations with regards to their actions, it's never surprising because you're given no reason to believe they couldn't do that. It's a very boring and lame way of handling characters because it just involves way too much stringing along, which is already highly prevalent in most mystery shows. I would slot every character into either \"obnoxious fuck-face\" or \"literally nothing\" anyway, and this, in addition to the overbearing grimdark tone, results in no scene ever being fun. All of this just makes the telegraphed deaths that much more annoying.\\n\\n\r\nAudience: Hmm, I wonder...this character is getting more lines of dialogue and screen time than normal...haha, I'm sure it's just a coincidence!\\n\\n\r\nTo add to my frustration even further, I just hate and can't make sense of most of the character's actions. To give an example, in episode 1, I found it insurmountably frustrating that Naegi wouldn't tell the Future Foundation why he held the Despairs captive and that he ran an experiment on them. How convenient that there's an overly angry guy there so that Naegi could be punched and have an excuse not to talk! Even worse than this, Munakata is a character that I just cannot understand no matter how hard I try. He seems to kill people at complete random and for no discernible reason, and screams really loudly about hope and despair because of his dead girlfriend (By the way, it's not just Munakata - none of the characters' motivations makes any sense). However, the scene that's the worst offender of complete and utter stupidity, and embodies all of my problems with the way characters act in this anime is the one in which (Spoiler) Ruruka kills Izayoi. The leaps in logic and sheer ridiculousness of this scene combined with the fact that it is taking itself 100% seriously makes me laugh so hard. It has absolutely no impact as an emotional scene, and both of the characters' attitudes and lines of thinking verge on complete insanity, resulting in a strange feeling where I not only feel no sympathy whatsoever, but I CANNOT bring myself to care no matter what. None of this is helped by the fact that not a single character feels like he/she has a life outside of the idiotic lines that they spew, making them painfully shallow and even harder to care for on closer inspection. I don't think it would be a stretch to say that there is no characterization in this show, because every characters' actions are hand-waved with DESPAIR. What can they do? They're in DESPAIR MODE after all.\\n\\n\r\nThe returning main characters remain stagnant throughout the episodes, making the experience even more dull than it needs to be. Yep, Naegi is still screaming about hope and people around him are still getting killed despite this. I would love to get behind his ideals, (that are practically a repeat of what they were in DR1) but the writers only make Naegi look like more of a dumbass since there are very few limitations to the death game. In DR1, Naegi's ideals of hope had significance since the \"death game\" actually had RULES and CONSEQUENCES. The characters don't actually want to kill each other, but it is promised that if they do, then they would be able to escape their despairing situation. This, in combination with some blackmailing by Monokuma makes it more believable that they might kill to achieve freedom, thereby creating a scenario where Naegi's \"hope\" has thematic relevance. In DR3 Future, everyone can just kill without any repercussions, and in fact, the whole event is treated like a free-for-all. Too bad every character is either a fucking insane person who doesn't mind killing people for the flimsiest of reasons, and/or a person who has a horrible gripe with someone else. If this wasn't the case, everyone would have to be human beings with relatable emotions and Naegi's morals might actually help the situation! What a shame. Now look, I'm not advocating for DR3 to have the exact same message that the original game does, but since they just copy-pasted the plot setup and general feel of the game, it only invites this kind of criticism. What the hell kind of message is it even going for if not this? As far as Kirigiri goes, she's basically worthless and gets completely relegated to the sidelines. Possible wasted potential? Eh, I don't care anyway.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo, the only logical conclusion that one can draw from what I've said is that DR3 is not character driven, right? Maybe the characters were only made to serve a narrative purpose in order to create a more compelling mystery plot. This is obviously totally wrong and there's no redeeming this piece of shit at this point, but let's perform an examination anyway.... \\n\\n\r\nI think it should be noted that class trials have been removed entirely. The gimmick created to \"compensate\" for this is as follows: at a certain time, every character except  ONE \"culprit\" is forcefully put to sleep. Aside from making the whole series really boring, I believe this gimmick is even more idiotic than at first glance. How the fuck is anyone supposed to figure out who did these murders? You can argue that the same thing would happen without this gimmick because a culprit would typically make his move after everyone is asleep, but I beg to differ. Every character's sleep is controlled, so I'm assuming that they cannot be woke as well. This removes certain variables that make mysteries interesting. Maybe one character doesn't sleep well, so he overhears something strange in the middle of the night. Maybe a character intentionally stays awake in order to observe whether or not someone does something suspicious. Call these things overly convenient, but they're still possibilities that can shake up a normal mystery and allow the audience to soak in fucking CLUES so they can solve it themselves. In DR3, the murderer and his victims come off as a half-assed attempt at adding some air of intrigue and mystery in the background, instead of being front-and-center like they SHOULD BE. The characters, including Kirigiri, the supposed \"Ultimate Detective,\" just sort of look at the victims and say \"Yeah, they're dead all right!\" and move on without dwelling on each murder. That's because there's nothing to analyze about them whatsoever. There is one point in episode 8 where Kirigiri actually conducts an investigation that yields results, but this was for the sole purpose of a \"riveting\" plot twist (involving Forbidden Actions LOL) where the killer was someone besides the \"actual\" culprit. So, as far as the culprit to each murder goes, no one could have possibly observed who did the murders, and unless the killer is completely stupid, no one will be able to figure it out. Why did they even make this mechanic a thing? It's like they intentionally didn't want there to be interesting investigations or cases. What's stopping the culprit from killing everyone? The rules are so un-specific when they really need to be otherwise plot holes like this will come up. I have honestly hurt my fucking brain trying to think of the logic behind this plot device, so I'll stop here.\\n\\n\r\nBy the way, I am aware of the plot twist at the end of the series, but my issue is how this controlled sleep thing weakens the mystery the show builds up by having numerous apparent flaws and just making everything boring. I already hate trying to figure out \"whodunnit,\" so I doubt I would like the story even without this plot device. My beef with it is how it forces obligatory murders to happen throughout the show and how solving the mystery is impossible, so why even include the plot device at all when it actively makes your death game show have no tension or intrigue. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of that plot twist, Despair Video anyone? How about a Hope Video? How about the worst idea ever? Oh wait, I repeated myself three times. Honestly, do I need to say why this is so stupid? I didn't care about anything by the time the Videos were revealed, so I was just laughing along at the practical joke that was the conclusion of Danganronpa 3. Do you even understand the implications of videos that instantly cause hope and despair? It's world-altering to the point that I'm sure this is going to be the only major source of conflict the Danganronpa series will use from now on. The hope and despair thing has already gotten out of hand, and they just promoted it to a world-class meme. Congrats, I had a few laughs, but in retrospect, it's not that funny. It severely cheapens Junko's character because it proves that she was not an influential, persuasive figure, but instead that she just used god powers to make everyone feel despair!!!! Lame. You know what the best Despair Video is? An episode of Danganronpa 3. \\n\\n\r\nWell, that's it. You should have a clear idea of what I hate about the show by now if you even bothered to read this far, so I'll just complain about minor plot details until the end of the review.\\n\\n\r\nIn order to drag you into my next point, let's just imagine a world where Munakata (the Future Foundation guy with a katana) is the culprit in one of the murders. Since law and order has been completely disposed of, there is no conceivable way anyone would be able to stop that guy from fucking killing everyone. He, along with a few other characters, seem to have incredible super strength the likes of which have never been seen in Danganronpa. No, actually, Sakura from DR1 had a crazy, over-the-top fight with Monokuma, but this could be justified since it was a one time occurrence and could be passed off as some sort of joke, and the fact that Sakura is the ULTIMATE WRESTLER. (Not to mention that this somewhat fits with the tone of the games. Just watch any execution to understand that DR has a bit of craziness to it) Munakata is the Ultimate STUDENT COUNCIL PRESIDENT. Wow, I didn't know that student council presidents were flame katana wielding badasses that have superhuman fighting prowess. These ridiculous fights that happen pretty frequently in DR3 have no real justification for why each character is so damn powerful. There's a character that can demolish a wall with his bare hands, and to justify this, they slapped Sakura's title of wrestler onto him. Wow, good thing he was killed off early or else he would have been a problem! According to the creators, this is supposed to be a \"darker\" take on Danganronpa, so why are there so many tension-less, over-the-top fights? I dunno, I guess it would be too boring if they all had to be rational, normal human beings, and this is an anime after all! LOL amirite??!!!\\n\\n\r\nAll I can say about the narrative of DR3 is that it is dumb. There's no real way to infer that this is going to be the finale of the entire series other than the fact that Monokuma himself says so. Why is this the final killing game? On that note, why did it even need to be a killing game? It's not like the people that are trapped are the only non-Despairs left; there are other branches of the Future Foundation out there with many people working in each of them. The anime does not attempt at setting any kind of stakes, yet the series is making this out like this is the biggest and most epic incident to ever happen to humanity. What about Togami's special military force and access to high-end technology and military weapons? I can't imagine any despairs accomplishing much with those in the way, even if the other Future Foundation branches somehow cease functions. Not to mention, there's a very high chance that multiple people are going to walk away from the death game alive and be able to resume leading the work of their branch of the Future Foundation, so this killing game seems like it has a 100% chance to accomplish....pretty much nothing. Viewers can only assume that the new person controlling Monokuma is a legitimate retard. \\n\\n\r\nThe series doesn't even bother having a real ending, either. The last few episodes are just a clusterfuck of random plot contrivances strung together in such a way that barely resembles a story topped off with massive plot holes that contradict the entire series (Junko mind control). There's little to say about the last couple episodes that I haven't already mentioned in this review other than they were incredibly boring and stupid and I hated every second of them (oh wait you could've guessed that). My brain was hazing over during the viewing of these episodes, so I apologize for the lack of an in-depth analysis on how the resolution actually makes no sense whatsoever. I honestly didn't give a fuck at this point. \\n\\n\r\nSo...what was the point of this anime? It has horrible characters, a mess of a plot, and is generally boring to watch thanks in part to the garbage presentation. As far as thematic elements go, it's incredibly weak as well. Although I don't particularly care all that much for the games' themes, they at least have purpose in furthering the story as well as giving it a sub-textual point, which is better than not having one. In DR3, the words \"hope\" and \"despair\" are spouted off with such reckless abandon that the whole project seems more so an effort to make the anime \"feel\" like Danganronpa than actually trying to integrate this theme into the story or add anything new to the mix. I got nothing meaningful out of any of the characters or their actions, or any underlying themes that aren't already present in the first two games. \\n\\n\r\nMaybe they just didn't know where to go with the series and decided to quickly shit out a conclusion. This is actually really accurate the more I think about it, especially after watching the ending of the series, Kibou-hen. It's the dream ending that every Danganronpa fan wanted. It ties everything together in such a perfectly neat little bow that many people probably thought it was the best thing ever. However, I believe it is wholly unsatisfying and only served to re-emphasize the weaknesses of the series. Nothing that happens in Kibou-hen feels like a natural course-of-progress. Everything is being pushed toward this one goal point that MUST be reached for some reason. It has no time to stop for a breather and let its audience care about what is going on. Characters are magically resurrected from the dead with a stupid, hand-waved explanation, making me wonder why they died in the first place. Scenes that are made out to be emotionally charged are nothing more than a joke due to the lack of focus and development. Characters do their one \"thing\" that they're known for, and show no depth beyond that. It all feels so hollow and decidedly not genuine. If this is the ending everyone wanted, then I hope you're all happy, but I personally would've liked some more thought put into how they would reach this point. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________\\n\r\nI've said most of what I wanted to say about DR3. So here is where I'll place my exceedingly minor, miscellaneous complaints about the series that I couldn't fit into the review and end it off afterwords.\\n\\n\r\nI severely dislike that Monokuma is given barely any lines in this anime. To me, he was one of the best parts of the games, and to a much smaller extent, the original anime. His dialogue was usually entertaining, and his attempts to stir up despair in each of the characters was neat. The fact that Monokuma barely says anything in DR3 illustrates that the writers were probably very lazy and didn't want to think up any creative things for him to say. Or maybe they felt he wasn't needed because the tone is darker...yeah....that's it.\\n\\n\r\nWhy is Hagakure even in this shit? He does literally nothing and is incredibly extraneous(actually I could say this about most characters, SHIT). It could have been interesting to handle a character who wasn't trapped within the building, especially since he was one of my favorites in the game, but they just seem to treat him as a joke since he just shits around doing nothing the whole series. What a masterful use of all available resources, DR3 writers!\\n\\n\r\nI almost completely forgot about Asahina, but I think it should be mentioned that her only role in DR3 is to act as Naegi's legs whenever he needs to run in a hallway. While this is funny, it also makes me believe that she didn't even need to stay alive because she's actually a super boring character. This could either be a fault of the writers generally being incompetent, or her character being too reliant on Sakura for any intrigue, or both. At least she wasn't a fanservice vehicle I guess? \\n\\n\r\nI don't really care about the subplot with Monaka. I didn't play Ultra Despair Girls because I think it looks like a shitty game, but I think her character was entirely unnecessary in the context of this anime. It doesn't help that the episode where she is the focus, episode 7, is probably one of the worst in the series due to the amount of unnecessary fanservice and general pointlessness of its plot. I guess her purpose was to be a misdirect by making you think she was the one who trapped everyone in the building, but this kind of fails to be convincing since they reveal her identity relatively early on. All she manages to do is take up an unneeded amount of screen time that all ends up being for naught in the end. However, I'll admit she is involved with what is probably the most entertaining scene in the whole show, if only for its absurdity. \\n\\n\r\nThe bullshit at the end of episode 8 LOL. The writers realized that Togami could just rescue them all so they ass-pulled super hard and made it so this couldn't happen. This made me burst out laughing.\\n\\n\r\nI hate how DR3 Future Arc relies on its companion series \"Despair Arc\" to develop its dead characters. Not only is it hard to care about them because you know they're dead, but they usually aren't given enough screen time to make an impact, which is somewhat due to their rushed portrayal, but also because there are so many characters to focus on. It's the same problem that Akame ga Kill has, where the increasing number of character deaths is proportional to the amount of not giving a fuck. To be honest, Despair Arc suffers from many of the same problems that Future Arc does. The only edge it has over Future Arc is that my pre-knowledge of the characters from my play-through of DR2 allows me to enjoy it a tiny bit more. However, this is also a reason why I find it boring since I've already been over these characters once before, and it doesn't seem too keen on adding more to them. I will probably never watch more than the first episode of this series.\\n\\n\r\nI think that this show's most damning sin, though, is how cheap it all feels. I could chalk this up to any aspect that I have criticized so far, but for the perfect example, you need look no further than the ending of each episode. They're ALL cliffhangers in one way or the other. Oh no! What if Asahina is dead?! I don't actually care because she's been given zero meaningful scenes so far, but oh the humanity!!! You probably get the point, but I still believe the worst offender of this is the faked death of Kirigiri, who is the most beloved character in DR (for some reason). She was so fucking worthless before then that I was applauding at how much they made me not care at the prospect of her dying. I'm actually not bashing cliffhangers as a concept necessarily (though I do dislike them) because I can understand the need to occasionally incite some hype on the part of the audience, and I don't really watch shows weekly, so I don't care as much. But is DR3 that desperate for views? I'd even say that including cliffhangers at the frequency that this show does is downright detrimental to its quality. It makes the pacing feel really off, since the inclusion of these cliffhangers is at the expense of entire episodes being total snooze fests. It almost seems like the writers were forcing themselves to construct episodes like this, and this could either be because the content they had to work with is legitimately not that interesting or because they were under a preconceived notion that Danganronpa was ONLY about characters dying, and they wanted to play it up as much as possible. Could also be both, or neither. Needless to say, it's annoying. It's funny because all of this is practically an emulation of those excellent episodes of Humanity has Declined (sup Seiji), but instead of becoming self-aware of their wrongdoings like the great characters in that show, the DR3 writers charge ahead without any shred of guilt regarding the manipulation of their own audience. Despicable, and definitely not an example to be followed. \\n\\n\r\nBy the way, I have been filled in on some of what happens in Despair Arc, so I can confirm that the way the stories intertwine is horribly done and (surprisingly) makes me hate it more. Hurray for hand-waving the entire plot with the most ridiculously boring plot device imaginable!  \\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nREVIEW TL;DR: Incredibly weak presentation on all fronts, fails at being visually interesting, has dull and idiotic dialogue, lack of attention to detail (especially in the setting), stupid plot devices that make little sense, unrelentingly boring, poorly done characters that fail at being engaging, mystery falls flat no matter if you watch this series alone or with its companion show, lacks thematic depth, plot holes that contradict the series' lore, overall disappointment in every major plot point, and has so many more details that annoy me to no end. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, what a disappointment. Actually, to be honest, I had low expectations to begin with. Especially when given a 12 episode run time, it's plain to see that the Danganronpa formula has no merit when converted into animated format. They could've gone in many different directions to compensate for this (such as not making it another killing game maybe??), but instead they only opted to do something VERY slightly different while simultaneous stripping the DR formula of its necessary parts, and failed spectacularly as a result. \\n\\n\r\nIs it possible that I've just gotten tired of Danganronpa over the years? Maybe this is true. After all, the games suffer from a few of the problems I've listed in this review and have their fair share of other annoyances. This anime certainly didn't help, with it essentially shitting all over both of the games' stories. I've also grown quite tired of the \"death game\" format of story, as most of the common plot elements in it bore me to tears now. \\n\\n\r\nEven still, I fondly remember playing Danganronpa on the Vita the day it came out. It was the same for its sequel, too. I remember absolutely loving these games and obsessing over them with my friends. Over time, after playing better games and watching better anime, my enthusiasm towards the series died down. When DR3 was announced, I thought maybe my interest in the series could be re-invigorated. I'm not one to get \"hyped\" for anything new, but I was ready to hop on board and have a great time. Yeah, I can be optimistic. I would've even been somewhat forgiving if the show was fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nBut it wasn't. Did I possibly miss the sign hanging overhead that read \"Fun and wacky times ahead, haha!\" before walking through the doorway? Could I possibly hate fun? \\n\\n\r\nObviously, no. You would be hard-pressed to find someone out there that doesn't love fun, and I would have been having it while watching this show if not for the fact that I don't believe that sign ever existed. I'm not someone that requires all shows to appeal to my higher senses in order for me to like them. Nevertheless, I would prefer my story-driven anime such as this to be BOTH super enjoyable to watch and to make me think about it, but I can still respect the sensation of pure fun that can be elicited out of shows I would never consider putting among my favorites (Little Witch Academia is a perfect example of this). DR3 just sucks at fun. It was a chore to watch, and I honestly salvaged no enjoyment whatsoever out of anything in it. If, while watching a show, I zone out the events that are happening to think about my favorite shows, and I have to rewind because of it, then there might be a problem somewhere. Sorry, but I don't enjoy \"turning my brain off\" while watching a show.\\n\\n\r\nI also want to make it clear that I have never thought about why a show bothered me with such painstaking detail before. To be honest, I don't even like writing these kinds of long-form reviews because there's usually an opinion out there that echoes my own (this review was enjoyable to write, though). And, typically, I drop a show when I feel that I won't like it anyway, so I haven't had many opportunities to do this.\\n\\n\r\nCall me overly pessimistic for despising this show so much to give it a 1/10 (a rating I have only given to 4 other shows and always hesitate to use), but I still seriously believe Danganronpa did not deserve this. It did not deserve to get so thoroughly embarrassed by this god-awful excuse of an anime. It has no merits whatsoever, as a standalone anime or a conclusion to the series. It's not nice to look at, it has a bland soundtrack, it's unsatisfying, it's boring, it's annoying, it's stupid. \\n\\n\r\nI wish it didn't exist. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n....is what I would say, if I cared enough.",

            "content": "If I had to describe Danganronpa 3 in one word, it would be \"unnecessary\". That's ultimately what it all boils down to. DR3 is not a necessary part of Danganronpa canon, nor is it necessary to watch it. It's completely disposable, and altogether just pretty terrible.\r\nIt's pretty hard to write an in-depth review of DR3 Future without going into heavy spoiler territory, since exactly where the story goes is a big part of why it's so disappointing, but I'll try my best. Future sets itself up as another killing game, although this time it's more akin to something found in Zero Escape than Danganronpa proper.It remains a murder mystery, albeit one very different to those found in DR1 and 2. The mystery's solution ends up not only being lame, but also massively predictable. The big reveal towards the end was a total non-event since I'd already figured it out several episodes ago. The mastermind behind the incident is also a letdown, since it was so extensively telegraphed that it seemed almost too obvious to be true. The methods used, the characters involved, the narrative weaved between both this and DR3 Despair... everything is weak.\\n\\n\r\nBut it's not the destination, right? If the journey is enjoyable, then the answers we get at the end don't make and break the whole series, right? Sure, but DR3 Future's journey isn't enjoyable in the slightest. Most of the episodes feel like filler, with pointless characters acting out pointless subplots that don't go anywhere, and they end up pointlessly getting killed. They could've easily told this story in half the number of episodes with how completely unnecessary most of them are. Aside from a select few, most of the characters also only exist to get killed. Not to further the plot at all, but simply just because people will expect a lot of deaths from this series. Both new and returning characters are largely one-note, with only Kyosuke Munakata and Juzo Sakakura showing any kind of depth. None of these other people, including the DR1 survivors, are interesting at all. Even Kirigiri, one of DR1's driving forces, is reduced to a glorified extra.\\n\\n\r\nProduction value-wise, the animation is slightly better than DR3 Despair's, though not by much. The music and voice acting however are, as always, top notch.\\n\\n\r\nWas DR3 Future a completely miserable experience, though? Sorta, but not quite. The most fun I had was discussing theories and just how stupid the show kept getting every week, and if you can't have that experience then I say skip DR3 entirely. Skip if if you've played the games, absolutely skip it if you haven't played the games, just skip it. It's a waste of time.",

            "content": "With the end of Danganronpa 2, fans couldn\u2019t help but be a tad bit disappointed with its conclusion as it didn\u2019t wrap all the problems present in the franchise. And situations were left unsolved and we needed to know more about the \u201cFuture Foundation\u201d. With the third Danganronpa being confirmed to be part of a new universe, the despair for the fans only continued. But with the announcement of a anime sequel to the second Danganronpa game, fans regained all hope for a proper conclusion for this universe, which will leave us satisfying. Whether or not Danganronpa 3 manages to succeed in doing so willonly be decided once Kibou-hen airs, but for now, Mirai-hen is a satisfying continuation of the Danganronpa series; one that feels home with the franchise despite its differences with the previous entries. \\n\\n\r\n~{Story}~\\n\r\nDo note that this is called Danganronpa 3 for a reason. It\u2019s meant to be watched after playing the first and second game (though you can watch the anime adaptation of the first game instead of playing it). But not doing so will make you not be aware of many plot points that are important in Danganronpa 3. Anyways, Mirai-hen continues off right from where the second game ended. Our protagonist from the first game who is now a member of the Future Foundation, Naegi Makoto, is held under suspicion for treason due to him saving the Remnants of Despair instead of killing them. Just when his punishment was being decided, Monokuma appear\u2026 again, and he announced a killing game\u2026 again. Now the members of the Future Foundation are trapped in their own headquarters, forced to play what is supposed to be the final killing game. The premise is basically similar to the previous games, but the main goal of the series is to find the traitor within the group. Overall, the story is handled well and there\u2019s some really big twist and turns along the way. Characters that you thought had plot armor may not. But most of the series is just basically watching the \u201cNumber of People Alive\u201d counter decreasing one by one. There isn\u2019t a proper conclusion in this series, since that is left for Kibou-hen. And some of the revelations near the end can seem a little messy. So all we can do now is hope that the final episode is just as good as the rest of the franchise. \\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Presentation}~\\n\r\nThere\u2019s one thing you\u2019ll notice from Mirai-hen, and that is how different it is from the first two games. First of all, gone is all the class trials from this killing game. This is more like \u201cBattle Royale\u201d where people have to be killed off one-by-one and the culprit won\u2019t be judged. That also means that you won\u2019t be hearing \u201csore wa chigau yo\u201d a lot in the series. Instead of six different cases to handle, now the characters have one large case: Who is the mastermind? If anything, Mirai-hen feels a lot like Zero Escape, which isn\u2019t a bad thing. Secondly, characters now have bracelets with NG codes on them. Each player has an NG code that gives them a restriction. If the restriction is crossed, the bracelet will inject them with lethal chemicals that will kill them. This gives the viewers a sense of mystery as you won\u2019t be able to know what are the characters\u2019 NG codes. But it\u2019s fun to guess and see if you\u2019re right! Thirdly, there are characters outside the game that get focus and you get to know what\u2019s going on outside the game, something which you weren\u2019t aware of in the previous games. Fourthly, humor is very rare in Mirai-hen as things are more darker here. This new tone for the series works well, especially since this is supposed to be the conclusion of this universe. Lastly, and most importantly, red blood is used instead of Danganronpa\u2019s trademark pink blood. Unlike Zetsubou-hen, which sticks with the pink blood, Mirai-hen decided to take a darker and more mature approach to the series, and it works really well. Overall, this is a quite different take on Danganronpa, but it\u2019s still really fun and feels like a proper sequel for the series. \\n\r\nPresentation: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Character}~\\n\r\nMirai-hen mainly focuses on the Future Foundation characters, which consists of most of the survivng characters from the first Danganronpa game, and new characters we get introduced in this series. The protagonist from Mirai-hen is the same as the first game, Naegi Makoto, a survivor of the first killing game, a member of the Future Foundation, and commonly known as the Ultimate Hope. The series focuses on Naegi and how he has to find out who the mastermind of the killing game is, while making sure that him and his friends survive. Accompanied by him is Asahina and Kirigiri from the first game, and many other new characters like Miratai and Munakata. A lot of the new characters are developed using Zetsubou-hen, and it works pretty well. And that\u2019s why both Mirai-hen and Zetsubou-hen should be watched together. Not all the new characters are likable, but that was the point. But many of the new characters do end up being really well done. Yukizome does play a big enough role in Mirai-hen, but her development from Zetsubou-hen carries on here. Munakata might seem a little irritating at first, but he ended up being one of my favorite characters from Danganronpa. Same goes for Sakakura too. Overall, the new characters end up living up to the Danganronpa name and the recurring characters are just as likable as they were in the first game\u2026 except Hagakure, \u2018cause no one likes Hagakure! What? Monokuma said so!\\n\r\nCharacter: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Art}~, \\n\r\nAs mentioned in my review for Zetsubou-hen, the art style in that series had a more vivid look to it than the games. Mirai-hen is the complete opposite as it has a darker art style that the first two games. This might have been done because Mirai-hen itself has a darker tone compared to the rest of the franchise. Or the art style is like that to represent Mirai-hen being a story that begins with despair, contrary to how Zetsubou-hen begins with hope. But this art style works well with this series. Most of the series takes place inside the headquarters, so most of the backgrounds will be the inside of buildings. But the backgrounds are pretty well detailed and well done. And the character design for the new characters are really good and well done. The characters from the first game also look more mature due to their age growth and their new designs look great as well.\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Animation}~\\n\r\nThe animations are fairly good in the series, but it isn\u2019t anything extraordinary. However, that is to say that the animation quality is fairly consistent throughout. Generally speaking, the animation is fluid enough and there aren\u2019t any noticeable animation quality drops. Character animations are done fairly well. Lighting is very differently that Zetsubou-hen. Everything looks bleaker and the lighting add to that. However, the animation quality is better than Zetsubou-hen\u2019s but that should be necessary since Mirai-hen is more action-heavy than Zetsubou-hen. As mentioned before Lerche did a good job in animating two seasons during the same time, which they aren\u2019t used too. \\n\r\nAnimation: 8/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Voice Acting}~\\n\r\nThe seiyuu cast is really good in Mirai-hen as most seiyuu return back to do their recurring character, and the seiyuu for the new characters are great too. One notable change is that Tarako is now the new voice of Monokuma instead of Ooyama Nobuyo. The reason so is because Ooyama is currently suffering from dementia, which is very sad to hear and hopefully she gets well soon (even if things don\u2019t look good). Though Tarako isn\u2019t as good as Ooyama, she does a decent job as Monokuma, though the character is barely here in Mirai-hen for an obvious reason. Ogata Megumi does a great job again as Naegi and makes him feel very similar to the first game. Hikasa Yoko does a great job with Kirigiri and Saito Chiwa does a good job with Asahina. We also get some pretty well-known people to voice act the new characters, like live-action actor Hongo Kanata as Mitarai, Morikawa Toshiyuki as Munakata, Suwabe Junichi as Sakakura, and many more. And they all do a great job in what they have to do.\\n\r\nVoice Acting: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Music}~\\n\r\nOne of Danganronpa\u2019s strong point is its music and Mirai-hen is no different. The OP, \u201cDEAD OR LIE\u201d, is really good and it grew on me really fast. The vocals are good, but the music for that song is awesome. The lyrics not only matches the series, but the franchise as a whole. It might very well be one of my favorite OP of the year. The ED, \u201cRecall THE END\u201d, creates more of a mystery vibe and it matches well with the series. The ED gets really good near the middle, once the second verse happens. Most of the background music consists of music used in the first two games, which is a good thing since the two games had some amazing music. The background music creates a sense of nostalgia due to its familiarity. Many of the OST that you\u2019ve heard during trials or investigations are used in Mirai-hen, and it works really well. \\n\r\nMusic: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Enjoyment}~\\n\r\nAs a Danganronpa fan, I found Mirai-hen to be a very satisfying continuation of the series and I can\u2019t wait to see how Kibou-hen wraps things up. Seeing the surviving characters of the first Danganronpa game was fun to see and the new characters in Mirai-hen are really interesting and unique. This new take on the killing game with its Zero Escape-ish style is great and it\u2019s new, darker tone works. A lot of unpredictable things happen and it keeps me more and more invested in the series. Every time an episode ended, I would spend the rest of my time waiting for the next episode, while theorizing who can be the mastermind with the given clues I have. Despite it being an anime and not a game, I still feel like I\u2019m using clues to solve this one big case, and that\u2019s what I wanted as a Danganronpa fan. \\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Mirai-hen is a proper continuation from the ending of the second Danganronpa game. If you are a fan of the series, you should definitely check Mirai-hen out if you haven\u2019t already. There\u2019s a lot of things that are different in Mirai-hen when compared to the rest of the series and it has a style of its own. But it still feels part of the Danganronpa series, even with these changes. Seeing the Danganronpa 1 characters again was fun and the new characters are nice too. The plot-twists and revelations work well and keep me invested in the series. Mirai-hen doesn\u2019t have a proper conclusion, but that is because Kibou-hen is supposed to be the conclusion for this Danganronpa universe. Hopefully the Mirai-hen arc will get rid of all the despair left in the series.\\n\\n\r\n+ A proper continuation of the Danganronpa series.\\n\r\n+ Killing game is unique and its new style and tone works well for the series.\\n\r\n+ The first game characters are back and most of the new characters are really well handled. \\n\r\n+ Interesting cat-and-mouse story that has a good amount of plot-twist and revelations.\\n\r\n+ Soundtrack from the first two games are used and they are effective and OP/ED are great. \\n\r\n- Revelations near the end raises a lot of questions.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.9/10",

            "content": "Note: Before watching this please play through all three Danganronpa games (1, SDR2, and Another episode). Also you should watch the future arc episode with the despair arc in broadcast order. Watch future arc ep 1 then despair arc ep 1, and so forth and so on. Watching the two series in this order is very important as Despair arc develops some of the characters from the Future arc.\r\nDanganronpa 3: Future arc is a sequel and essentially a finale to the Danganronpa series. Whereas the counterpart Despair arc is a prequel to the entire story, Future arc details the story after the Biggest, Most Awful,Most Tragic event in human history. It reintroduces the killing game shown in the DR series prior, except this time, in the real world, without any school rules. There are completely fresh batch of characters, some whom we eventually see fall.\\n\\n\r\nFuture arc centers around the main survivors of the events in DR1, along with the division leaders of the Future Foundation. The leaders themeselves had thought that they already caught the traitor, but little did they know they had already fallen into the real traitor's trap. To make the matters worse, this time the killings don't end in a class trial as it did in previous games. Instead, they have to find the traitor and kill him to end it once and for all. \\n\r\nThe story is basically kill or be killed. Unlike Despair arc which starts off with a more light hearted tone that constantly evolves into a more brooding tone, Future arc starts off with a darker tone straight of the bat. The first couple of seconds of ep 1 essentially shows how the world has become since the Biggest, Most Awful, Most Tragic event in human history. And throughout, the episodes are just constantly filled with tension as the characters try to somehow find a way to survive.\\n\r\nFuture arc also manages to weave in characters from all three Danganronpa series. Whether it is a whole episode dedicated to them or if it's just a couple of moments, it is still fun to watch the rest of the other game's cast after their events.\\n\r\nA problem with this kind of a setting though is the pacing, which was noticeable in Future arc. One episode could be filled with new events while the next could be slightly disappointing and rushed. However, the still lingering mysteries about the traitor and the NG codes (the only \"rules\" in the killing game) kept me hooked throughout. One huge disappointment was the plot twists regarding the DR 1 characters. At first I thought, \"this is really happening,\" but then after a couple of episodes and even in the Hope arc, the plot twist got ruined by playing it safe. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is great and the action scenes are fun to watch. The art itself was also a good point from Future arc. Like the tone, the color schemes of Future arc constantly stays on the darker color, unlike Despair arc which slowly transitions from lighter to darker. Also to emphasize the impact of the killing game, the staff even decided to change the blood from pink to red. At first, I didn't know how to feel about this as the pink blood was a unique part of the danganronpa series, but it was understandable considering this was the finale and they had to really highlight the brutality of the final killing game.\\n\r\nOne interesting aspect, like I mentioned, is that Despair arc events has great meaning in the Future arc. Knowing what happens in Despair arc comes in handy for the Future arc.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening song is great and the soundtracks are decent. However, being a guy who really pays attention to the OSTs, the ones in Future arc were slightly underwhelming. There is also an awesome cast of new voice actors who did great, alongside the voices we were already accustomed to.\\n\\n\r\nObviously, the most important part of Danganronpa series are its characters. When I was going through each DR series for the first time, I always wondered if I would get attached to the characters. The same was for the Future arc. Unfortunately, It's safe to say I like some of the characters, but not more than I wanted to. Maybe because the anime was just a 12 episode series and not an entire Visual novel, but it was harder for me to get attached to the characters. Some of them died too quickly, granted it was to showcase the brutality of the killing game but still. Some of them started out just plain annoying, although one certain character did get more fleshed out than the most.  In the latter episodes, a lot more characters get fleshed out a bit more, which was nice to see. . We got backgrounds and more personalities: whether interesting or annoying. However, it was still minimal, so I honestly did not care for most of them. One of the characters got more depth than most of any other characters in other DR series even. Anyways, although the new characters do show interesting traits and personalities, it was rather hard to get attached to most of them quickly. It was only after a couple more episodes that I got somewhat attached to more characters.\\n\r\nAfter 11 episodes, I have to say that the developments of some characters are pretty awesome to see. For example (SPOILER: Juzo), was one character I thought I would never like, but in the end he became the most developed and also became my favorite from the new cast. \\n\r\nAs for the original DR1 cast, they were pretty much the same. Kyouko being the smart detective trying to find out the traitor, Hagakure being Hagakure, and Naegi being that typical \"not let anyone die\" MC. One thing I liked from the original cast was Asahina, whom you could clearly see matured and developed after the killing game in DR1.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough their are clear flaws in both pacing and early characterization wise, Future arc still is a pretty decent watch. As with the DR games, it is always so stressful for the new episode to come out because you don't know who might die. The mystery of the traitor is not obvious and make you think of all the possibilities. One of the biggest downsides, however, is the underwhelming ending.  Character wise, although it startes out in a weak manner, gets better as episodes progress, though it is heavily limited. Although both Despair arc and Future arc are disappointing in many aspects, both are still a decent watch for dangaronpa fans.",

            "content": "Third time's the charm.\r\nHere it is, a third killing game. Monokuma managed to pull it off for the third time now, this time with 12 new characters in the killing game along with Naegi, Kirigiri and Hina. I was a little skeptic about this part after episode 3 but I'm glad it delivered near the end, as Danganronpa always does. This entry will launch off with a brand new killing game and it will be the (near) conclusion to the entire Danganronpa franchise of the Hopes Peak Academy era. We await the conclusion with Side:Hope.\r\nIf you're interested in watching this, you have to go backto the start of this series as this is the third entry from this series and watching this without knowledge of prior entries will confuse you and you wont get the full enjoyment out of this entry, not to mention it will also spoil the events of SDR1 and 2. If you have knowledge then the watch order would be episode 1 of Side:Future, then episode 1 of Side:Despair and continue that pattern with the finale being Side:Hope. Remember, this review will contain minor and major spoilers of SDR1 and 2 and also very minor spoilers of SDR3, you have been warned.\\n\\n\r\nThe story starts off almost right after the events of SDR2, Naegi's \"betrayal\" by siding with the Remnants of Despair. Que all the leading members of the Future Foundation along with some of the cast of SDR1 and boom, you have your brand new killing game, quite exciting isn't it? Here there is a new concept called NG codes - With NG codes, every participant has an action they can't do and the bangles are stuck on their wrists, if they end up doing said action then they get infected with poison, a neat concept for Danganronpa and it spices up this killing game. Also, every 2 hours they get infected with sleeping gas, then the traitor/killer wakes up and kills someone, if the traitor/killer kills someone then the game goes on, if no one dies then everyone wins the game. There is no class trials in this one. It's a rather slow start, but it later picks up and it gets very interesting, overall I thought it was a well written story, with plot twists, cliffhangers leaving you wanting more and overall nice direction, unfortunately we were left not with a conclusion yet as there will be one more episode in Side:Hope, therefore the last episode doesn't feel as satisfactory as it could have been.\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\\n\r\nStory - 9\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nAh, the characters, do they live up to the amazing casts of SDR1 and SDR2? No, unfortunately they don't, but wait, that doesn't mean they were bad at all. There were 12 brand new characters introduced to us, all of them were former Hopes Peak Academy students or staff. Two of the characters weren't really developed at all and felt very flat. Other two characters didn't feel interesting enough even though they were developed, they even got lots of screen time in the beginning so I was thoroughly disappointed in the begin. I'm glad they did get development though, otherwise it would've been bad. All the other 8 characters were fair game and I really enjoyed seeing the Vice-President in this anime, a great character to come out of this one. Thanks to Side:Despair we got to learn more about most of these characters too, which was nice.\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nThe art, just like Side:Despair, wasn't anything amazing. They did a few animation faults too, like covering what was supposed to be a hallway with a wall, constant changes in the characters positions after they wake up from the sleeping gas compared to how they were when they fell asleep. It wasn't necessarily bad, but I found it quite disappointing, but I guess it's understandable with how much work the animators are probably doing at the same time - Side:Future, Side:Despair and SDRV3 - still doesn't excuse it though.\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\\n\r\nArt & Animation: 6\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nNaturally, the sound is amazing. With new voice actors, they all did wonderful. Danganronpa never fails to amaze me when it comes to selecting the voice actors. The soundtrack is really good too. I have no issues with the sound at all.\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nExcept for the rather boring start, this was a blast to me, I really enjoyed seeing the returning characters again and I loved the direction of the story, A great sequel to SDR2 I might say, hopefully the conclusion to the series wont be bad, that would just be fairly disappointing after all the fun I've had with both sides.\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nWhile this show does have a few faults, I still think it was really good, a great anime that I recommend to any fan of the Danganronpa franchise, it's a must watch and I'll remember this one for a while just like the previous entries in this franchise.\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------",

            "content": "Danganronpa 3 for me is a very risky move for me especially due to the fact that it's a 12 episode anime and we know how that turned out to be last time. I reviewed Danganronpa 3 Despair arc and as I said it is a really broken anime.However, Future arc was really well constructed and was much better than despair arc, but it's still not the best thing i could have imagined. Im pretty sure hope arc will wrap things in a great way, otherwise This whole show would go to waste. So let's take a closer look about the anime that follows theevents of the NWP.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nThis anime no longer adapts the bright and energetic colors from the past entries. They decided to go really dark with this anime, even the blood is red now. I have to say that is a very daring decision to tamper with an art style that was iconic for danganronpa but honestly...I LOVED THIS CHANGE. It really works, you see mirai hen is supposed to be a concluding anime and it must have a really strong vibe in it that makes feel as if this anime is the beginning of the end, and thats how the new art style helped in this anime. The gory looked really disturbing and I loved that. It gives a more eerie vibe to the situation. Ofcourse the anime has the same issue as despair hen where i feel the character design lack details in some scenes,however in this anime it's very small. I wont say the art here is perfect but it definitely was amazing, really great great decision to go more darker\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nAs I mentioned before in the despair arc review, both animes of Danganronpa 3 recycle some old tracks with some new additions. While Despair arc felt lazy in its approach, future arc really did it right. There is simply not a single soundtrack in this anime that didn't make me feel uneasy. It's perfect, and the new additions in future arc were really great. I enjoyed both the recycled tracks and the new ones, not to mention both the op and the ed were MAGNIFICENT!!! Great job on the soundtrack, really eerie, mysterious, and really has the finale vibe in it\\n\\n\r\nStory 7/10\\n\r\nOK the story was good, but not a danganronpa level good. I felt like they have held back a little bit in this anime in terms of twist just to focus more on the theme of hope. the story is reeeeeeeaaallly slow paced here, but they use the same danganronpa formula here in which they give a slow story while throwing some cliffhangers and interesting plot points here and there to keep you moving until the end. I was kind of disappointed to see how certain twists in the story were not that shocking in this anime. I felt like this moments could've worked better if it was a video game, because the execution of these twist felt very how do you say relaxed rather than tense. I think that it is kind of hard for them to pull of a strong twist in anime because it's not the same as doing it in a video game. It was a shame also that story had to rely on despair arc to reveal some of the new character's past. Well the idea itself is not bad actually. The problem is this idea made despair so broken and incoherent because they had to fit a lot of stuff there that damaged the quality of despair arc. There is also a certain death scene in the anime that I was confused how it really lacked some impact on it, again you can tell that they struggled here in showing strong plot points here because of the restrictions of making a 12 episode anime. I did feel sad for that death but the execution of that death scene itself felt very relaxed and not dramatic enough. There is also an episode that pissed me the hell of in this anime where they dedicated an entire episode to showing the aftermath of ultra despair girls. Now I didn't play that game but ive seen walkthroughs and I know the story and honestly I did not like it. The episode was veery boring and did not add ANYTHING interesting to the story except for a bummer and a potential spoiler, hell I dont even expect those who liked ultra despair girls to appreciate that episode. It killed the pace. Now The best thing about the story of mirai hen is how they tackled the the themes of hope. Honestly, it was perfectly executed. I won't talk in details here to avoid              spoilers, but the way tackled hope in this anime was more mature and much better than the past entries. Also, every moment with new characters especially munakata was really great, except for juzo. Overall the story is good with really strong approach to its themes but lacking a little bit in twists.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10\\n\r\nMirai hen did FANTASTIC job with developing it's characters especially the new ones. Well don't expect much of development from the original cast but I gotta tell you: you will LOVE the new characters. Munakata, Chisa, Sakakura, Tengan, Mitarai, and Kizakura were definitely Great!!! Munakata was my favorite. His Ideals, his idea of hope, his determination, his past and how it changed all together made Munakata a really enthralling character. Not to mention the relationship between the trio Munakata, Sakakura, and Chisa was very deep and well constructed. Ofcourse most of this development was aided by the despair arc which is really good except that as i mentioned before it puts a lot of burden on despair arc. I think to conclude my thoughts about Tengan and Ryota, I have to watch Hope arc first and thats why i am not gonna talk about them here. Overall, the anime did great in its delivery on presenting its character except for the main danganronpa which was a bummer but understandable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10\\n\r\nFrom the first episode of this anime, The tension and expectations never dries away. The plot for me was disappointing at times and then at other times it just captures me again. two things kind of killed my enjoyment here. First of all, the excess of action scenes here. It was okay at the beginning, it makes you feel the tension but later on...I think the anime changed to BlazBlue. The action scenes were really bothersome to watch, yeah the animation was descent but  this is not danganronpa anymore. you see these action scenes start to kill all the mysterious vibes and thrills of the anime, it feels really childish, they should have focused more on making a good mystery adventure rather than stupid and annoying action scenes. the other thing that annoyed is that ultra despair girls episode.....YES ITS THAT ANNOYING. Around the end of the anime, everything becomes just right, just the way you wanted it to be and the way it should have been from the beginning, continuous mystery solving and character tension without overuse of actions is what this anime should have done. As a whole, the anime is really entertaining and keeps you guessing while annoying you with stupid action scenes here and there\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\r\nYes Mirai hen wasn't disappointing at all.It is a really good anime, but you can see that spike chunsoft didn't do their best here, I think they should,ve just focused on making a game even if they don't want the same killing game to be repeated a third time. Im just guessing they didn't know how to do it with a game and so they decided to make an anime. The final piece remaining is the hope arc which will determine for sure whether this anime is a masterpiece or a failed conclusion. I put my trust in spike chunsoft",

I recommend you read through a synopsis of the other parts of the series or you may be confused on some of the things they mention. You should watch Zetsobou-hen alongside it for some background info.)\r\nI like Dangan Ronpa 3 because it wrapped everything up into a nice present.\r\nI like Dangan Ronpa 3 because it is split up into two parts (soon three) to not condense any info.\r\nIf you have been really into the series, you will be satisfied to know a lotof things are covered especially regarding Chiaki and the Remnants of Despair. You also get to see Junko Enoshima behind the scenes as she works her plan to bring the world into despair!\\n\r\n-------------------\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: The story is great. As I said, it wraps everything up and makes everything clear. If you watched it as it broadcasts, you hungered for new episodes as the cliffhangers were appropriately placed. Of course, a lot of people will be dying and a character you may not expect. A certain cliff hanger in episode 11 is unexpected, but it's never anything I was expecting.\\n\\n\r\nART: The art is very good. The art is not the best, but it's not the worse I have seen (ex. Asako Get You!). The shading is really nice. They have improved certain animation aspects such as gore (mostly in Zetsobou-hen).\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: The sound is outstanding. I rate sound by how memorable it was. There are some reuse of songs from the game, but they are remastered(?). The opening to Zetsobou-hen is my favorite versus this OP, it's calm despite what would later happen..\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: The character design is good. I don't really like many of the new characters, but they aren't bad or bland.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: I really, really, really, enjoyed this installment. It's sad to see it end (?) and I cannot wait for the finale. I am really hyped and you will be to even if you simply started watching right now.\\n\\n\r\nThat's all. Don't give in to DESPAIR!\\n\\n",

            "content": "Tldr, bad writing, unlikable characters, and animation errors make this a truely unenjoyable experience from start to finish, with EXTRA bad parts thrown in for good measure.\r\nI've played every Danganronpa game, and read every story and relevant side plot.\r\nStarting from the first moments of this anime you'll notice a surprising lack of budget. The art is barely passable for a series of this size, the sound direction is forgettable at best, and the writing is awful. The character's are where danganronpa has always shined, but don't expect them to save the story this time. They are completely unlikable, and have no real set motivations orgoals. The only time you'll learn anything new, interesting, or plot relevant about a character is in flashbacks seconds before they die.\\n\\n\r\nSkipping the art and sound, which are both merely low budget, we'll talk about the writing and story. As mentioned, the new characters have no real set motivations or personalities. They exist merely to bump heads with characters you know from DR1, and have no lives beyond that. You never get the feeling one of these characters will be missed by someone, you never get the feeling that they were someones loved one or partner, these characters ONLY exist in the vacuum of this anime plot to chase Naegi and Aoi around for 20 minutes an episode.  This may lead you to believe that Naegi and Aoi are central figures to the plot, that they are relevantly unraveling the mysteries and being developed as characters. You'd be wrong though. They have nearly no plot relevance, they are only there along with the rest of the living Dr1 cast to pretend to die at the end of episodes so viewers will watch the next episode. It never sticks though, and some of the fakeouts get pretty insulting by the end of it. Episode seven in particular is just filler, and can be completely skipped. Episode 9 is when the anime really hits it's lowest points however. Everything after episode 9 will leave you scratching your head, wondering why this anime was made in the first place. The anime ends where it starts, a status quo were nearly nothing new has been introduced to the DR canon, and the UTMOST \"Care\" was taken to make sure that NOTHING about the old characters has changed in any way.\\n\\n\r\nOn pure enjoyment factor alone, I'd recommend fans of the games, and fans of anime in any form to avoid this series. Scenes will drive you crazy with constant continuity errors, animation errors, and forgotten plot threads.  The premise is stupid, and is never justified. Unlikable characters are made up on the spot just to die. Deathflags are so obvious that you'll never be surprised or caught off guard. Characters walk on screen and announce their time to die, then die, and none of the other characters really seem to care. Several times characters are found dead, or murdered directly in front of everyone, and nobody bats an eye or cares.  Ends on Status Quo restoration,  the entire anime can be removed without losing anything from the series. \\n\\n\r\nI'll finish this review on a somewhat positive note. The characters Ruruka and Seiko have their own subplot that spans for almost the entire series filling up whatever time isn't taken by Naegi and Aoi doing basically nothing. The sub plot has some obvious flaws but is interesting and keeps the episodes moving, and these two characters actually end up being developed because of it, you may accidentally end up even caring for them.  However just as their character arcs come to a close the story reminds you how stupid you were for liking any of the new characters. Then replaces them with even more Aoi and naegi, just running around and not really accomplishing anything.\\n",

            "content": "It's been three years since I looked at the first Danganronpa anime. While it wasn't one of the best anime I've seen, I did rather like it. Now we're skipping ahead to Danganronpa 3, because there wasn't a Danganronpa 2 anime. Maybe  they thought the game wouldn't translate well. Maybe they didn't consider it good enough. Maybe they got distracted reading Voyages of the Cerberus and missed their window of opportunity. The first two are more likely by far but a man can daydream. The odd thing about Danganronpa 3 is that it's split into two settings, both of which were running at roughlythe same time. This week, we'll be looking at the Mirai-hen & Kibou-hen setting this week. Although I may take a look at the Zetsubou-hen setting later this month. So, let's take a look and see how it holds up compared to the first series. \\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nWe open with our protagonist from the first series, Naegi Makoto, being taken to the headquarters of the Future Foundation to answer charges of being a traitor. Supposedly, he safeguarded a bunch of remnants of despair. Maybe that's what happened in the second game. While attending the meeting with all the foundation's higher ups, along with Kirigiri  & Asahina, the building gets attacked. They wake up to a Monokuma video telling them that they've been brought into a game of despair. He claims that one of them is a traitor and, in order to end the game, they have to either kill the traitor or wake up with all of them alive. To put them to sleep at regular intervals, they're also given wristbands that inject them with sleeping drugs after a set amount of time. The wristbands are also programmed with forbidden actions. Should any of them do their forbidden action, they'll be injected with a lethal amount of poison. Naturally, Naegi is instantly viewed as the most suspicious by several people. Can he survive their attacks and solve the mystery around him?\\n\\n\r\nThere are two major flaws with the series. The first is that it spends a lot of time following the characters who are outside of the game. A lot of the stuff they do is really over the top action fare and it hugely undermines any suspense or horror atmosphere that's happening on the inside. Not only that, but the events on the outside don't do that much. They reveal some information that the audience could have gotten from the characters on the inside and it would have worked better. The other big problem with the series are the speeches. In the first Danganronpa anime, the ending had a big speech and it was cheesy and kind of stupid, but it didn't hurt the series over-much since the bulk of it focused on the mysteries, which were pretty solid. In this series, there are a lot of really cheesy speeches about hope and despair. A lot of the discussion is less about the mystery and more about hope. These are speeches that could kind of work, if they were in a Precure series or something else for small children, but that are really absurd and ridiculous in this context. By the way, the Kibou-hen special is mostly cheesy speeches to wrap everything up and the series retconning what could have been a strong tragic moment thereby ruining it.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, this was a solid premise. The idea of all these characters being trapped in a claustrophobic setting and uncertain of who they can trust is a compelling one. If they'd focused more on that facet and less on over the top action and speeches, this series could have been really good. I also do like the ultimate reveal. The twist is also genuinely clever. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nIn the first series, the characters were largely kind of shallow archetypes, but passable for what the series was doing. In this one, not so much. While the characters are still shallow, they're also a bit annoying. Particularly Naegi and Munakata with their long speeches. We get it, you guys have a serious hope fetish, leave it in the bedroom. The only character who gets to keep their dignity is Kirigiri. She's the only character who actually seems interested in solving the mystery. The rest spend their time chasing after each other, hiding, or following her lead. \\n\\n\r\nOn the outside, we have our action squad, Naegi's sister & Touko from the first series doing the bulk of it. We also have Tagami who gives some exposition and orders people around. We also get to see Hagakure hang about outside the Future Foundation building being completely ineffectual. I seriously have no idea why he's here. He contributes nothing to the story. They just cut to him doing random things on occasion. In one scene he's fortune telling. In another he's fishing and, in another he's fleeing a helicopter. None of which affects the plot in the slightest. You could seriously replace him with a black Labrador and nothing would change. Except that the Labrador wouldn't be as annoying and would be cute. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nI've mentioned the overblown action scenes already. They aren't good. The absurd, overblown character designs continue to be a weakness for the series. I'm sorry, but it's distracting when your horror mystery has characters who look like they should be challenging children to a trading card game in order to steal Egyptian artefacts. The unique, game aesthetic the first game had with its visual style aren't present in this one. Which is kind of a shame since those did give the series a unique identity. Which is something this one could use. We've got dark visuals mixed with goofy character designs. Neither of which is really unique. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nHikasa Yoko is really good in this. I'll also give credit to Ogata Megumi, in spite of Naegi's annoying qualities, she does give a strong performance as him. Saito Chiwa and Ishida Akira are also quite good. As are Suwabe Junichi & Morikawa Toshiyuki. Most of these performances, in all fairness, are perfectly passable. There are a few exceptions. Minase Inori doesn't do well when her character gets in any kind of emotional moment. Neither does Eguchi Takuya. I don't know if it's the direction or just that they aren't good at serious moments. I've heard them both give strong performances in comedic works, but never in anything serious. Hirano Aya's character is just an annoyance. \\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nThere's a  bit. Naegi's sister and Touko seem to get really close in their scenes together. Which culminates in a really homo-erotic speech from the sister while they're clinging to a rocket. Although, it does seem to be one-sided with all indications being that Touko still has a thing for Tagami. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nThis was a series with a promising premise. Unfortunately, it's held back by a lacklustre execution that largely fails to take advantage of it. Instead, we're given cheesy hope speeches, ridiculous action scenes and characters who mostly can't be bothered with the mystery. In the end, it's a weak follow up. My final rating is going to be a 4/10. Next week I'll continue horror anime month with a look at 91 Days.",

            "content": "It's hard to objectively look at the series you invested hours and hours into.\r\nThis anime will not be for everyone. Even if you decide to play through all the visual novels and a spin-off game (which is rather crucial to the story as well), there is a chance you'll find it \"unnecessary\", \"poor\" or just horrible and not deserving to be part of the series. I got a lot more out of the anime than I was originally expected, being told by everyone, how bad this show is. If you played through all the games, I dont see a reason why you wouldn't atleast trythis. I will keep this review as spoiler-free as I can. \\n\\n\r\nI'll start with praising the Opening, as it really deserved it. Visuals are beautiful, it doesn't shove any important plot points into your face, and, of course, the song itself is amazing.\\n\\n\r\nThis is only half of the show, and I recommend alternating between Future Arc and Despair arc episode by episode (starting with future) as that will save some interesting surprises for both serieses. You should also alternate between this review and one on Despair arc. Which is an obvious joke and you shouldn't bother, but the idea of having to watch two shows at the same time is rather interesting and works surprisingly well for this one. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the most apparent reasons to watch this anime is for the characters, and this one really delivers. Some characters weren't fully explored, due to the nature of the killing game, some are more fleshed out in the despair arc, some get maybe a bit too much screentime, but the original gang is back and it was really nice to see them again. New characters were really hit or miss, and I wish some of them survived for longer, but thats part of the fun I guess. I dont think this would work as any game, same as the original visual novel didn't work as anime, this story is not \"Danganronpa 3, but the anime for some reason\", it is a way to tie all loose ends which in theory works much better than a VN would. If it suceeds in practice, is another question. There are many pretty obvious plot holes in this story, some things happen just because, it isn't clear how some stuff works, characters sometimes act irrationally, some long awaited questions aren't satisfying enough or not given at all, etc. But you shouldn't expect any serious realism from this anime. Original VN had many silly moments as well. Many plot holes can be explained if you think about the situation the characters have to face and overall pressure on them (and also the ridiculous setting of the series of actual superhumans existing here, wiping out armies with ease). I dont think it makes the anime much worse, but some moments did sting a little, esspecially near the end. Danganronpa always had some problems with satisfying and logical endings, and this one is not really an exception. The overall plot is really a 7 because of it, it isn't horrible, and it has some good moments, but I dont think it is on par with the games. And despite that, there were enough moments to keep me invested in it, making it hard to wait through an episode of Despair arc to find out what happens next here (which, honestly, was the case for Despair arc too, and was the weirdest thing I've experienced while watching an anime).\\n\\n\r\nDid I mention that art is pretty good yet? The colour scheme and shots convey the atmosphere very well, action scenes, while not being super detailed, are well animated and it is clear that a lot of work went into them. There is some repetition in shots, but there aren't too many to get in your eyes. Overall, Lerche did a really good job with this one. I expected to be always disturbed by the blood not being trademark pink, as it was in VNs, but it surprisingly fitted more to the story it was trying to tell. \\n\\n\r\nI suppose what matters the most, is if it does well as the continuation and partly conclusion of the series. And I think that the answer is yes. It doesn't ruin any already established characters or concepts, it evolves them, it really feels like those characters indeed have suffered through a lot of despair, esspecially the characters from the first game. It is worthy to be in the series, as I see it. \\n\\n\r\nI really loved playing through the games, and I loved watching this anime, no matter how silly it was at times. If compared to Despair arc, I'd say that this one is worse of a final product, but thats mostly because I enjoyed the second game so much. If you just want more danganronpa, this is for you, there is not much more like this, in both anime or videogames. It isn't flawless, but it really isn't as bad as some say. I give this show a subjective 9 and an objective 7, which rounds up to an 8, cus I make the rules here. Now, go watch it if you haven't already and let the game begin!\\n\\n\r\nAlso, ED is good, but I skipped it maybe a bit too much.",

            "content": "LA is gonna change up the format for this review as well as Zetsubou-hen by making it a sorta of 3-parter due to the nature of how Danganronpa 3's animes were presented so if you wanted to see LA's take on Zetsubou-hen and Kibou-hen then this review won't be in it.\r\nBefore LA talks about Zetsubou-hen, LA will say that both Mirai-hen and Zetsubou-hen anime are something of a companion piece with each other giving off clues or events that transpired that lead it to how or when it happened. The obvious companion piece both these anime have is \"trying to find the traitor\" and whysome of the founders are butting heads with each other in Mirai-hen and \"how Danganronpa's franchise started\" as well as some backstory on some of the newer characters in Mirai-hen for Zetsubou-hen and both arcs gives and feeds information to each other. For anime-episode order, you should/MUST watch by starting with Mirai-hen's episode then Zetsubou-hen episode then back and forth after that for \"clarity\". Once both Mirai-hen and Zetsubou-hen have finished finishing with Mirai-hen's final episode go to Kibou-hen for the finale\\n\\n\r\nWith that out of the way\\n\\n\r\nMirai-hen's \"ultimate death game\" by in large vastly different from the the original series' one, where there are NO trials, as well as forbidden actions you'll not allowed to do in the death game otherwise you'll die instantly and having the find the traitor within the Future Foundation, before the traitor picks hope out one by one, if not the Future Foundation are already going after each other already due to the previous backstories and lingering grudges that the newer characters has. (See Zetsubou-hen review). This as a precedent makes the game far more complicated and all the more bloody with clash of beliefs of the same thing, just differing ways in which the Future Foundation members especially Kyousuke Munakata voiced by Toshiyuki Morikawa.\\n\\n\r\nDue to the nature of the death game, it's expected that some of the Future Foundation members' screentime is rather limited from the Great Gozu voiced by Kenta Miyake and Daisaku Bandai voiced by Rie Kugimiya being more obvious ones, the only exception to this is Chisa Yukizome voiced by Mai Nakahara as her backstory goes full circle in Zetsubou-hen. Aside the from that, many of the other Future Foundation members do get some form of development such as the quarreling between Ruruka Andou voiced by Inori Minase and Seiko Kimura voiced by Saki Fujita with Sounosuke Izayoi voiced by Takuya Eguchi in the crossfire of it as well as Kazuo Tengan voiced by Hidekatsu Shibata the chairman of the Future Foundation believing in Makoto. With that, the rest of the Future Foundation (omitting the characters from the original like Kyouko and Aoi) all have their backstory in Zetsubou-hen. If there was much to say about the focus of the character development, it squarely likes to focus on the more immediate (as well as important least developed) characters and \"dispose\" of them once their done, just hopefully you've got invested in right characters before their untimely deaths because Mirai-hen does not care who dies here...very much like the death game itself. BUT just because character die doesn't mean that's it as sure they might have their time in Zetsubou-hen (maybe), BUT...this is Danganronpa after all...really what LA is trying to say is, even in this death game even beware of those who are already dead.\\n\\n\r\nFor what this ultimate death game gave LA, was a sense of paranoia to the point LA was both analyzing and being paranoia as to who's gonna die next as well as finding out who the \"pawn\" (if there even is one!), \"traitor\" (who's killing the future Foundation members) and \"mastermind\" (Junko died TWICE right...so who's controlling this Monokuma?) are in this complicated personal grudges and hope vs. hope death game and Mirai-hen is chock to the brim with red herring deaths or unexpected ones...it keeps you on your toes to the point your being suspicious of characters who might already be dead, yes even LA was suspicious of even the dead characters especially of Chisa considering she has a bigger role in Zetsubou-hen. If there was something that Mirai-hen did right was to bring in the atmosphere of despair and paranoia. Despair from the unexpected deaths, paranoia from who's gonna die next and speculating who the mastermind, traitor and pawn are.\\n\\n\r\nWhich will also bring up the unexpected plot twists concerning the ultimate death game, from the characters who will die PERMANENTLY to who the mastermind, traitor and pawns are and this is where the paranoia and despair ramps up the tension even further ohh and add in the expected unexpected red herrings and this death game has no mercy on their characters and none our your speculations. Another words...the plot twists are both amazing, confusing and paranoid-levels of \"HOW IN THE HELL WHY!??!?!?!\" \\n\\n\r\nOhh right...favourite character?...LA had two. Chisa Yukizome and Kyouko Kirigiri.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation done once again by Lerche like from the original series, Lerche brought out the dull gray tones depicting rather bleak tones right for the death game and guess what those pink blood are GONE in Mirai-hen showing red blood this time, so it's telling their serious for this one. The color palette aside from the colorful cast are green and red tinge to gray and black backgrounds (this is considering the setting is in a massive tower...the color palette is acceptable). The action scenes were pretty decent overall going from decent tactical battles to wholesale crazy ones. Where the animation kind of went down was that it for the most part has more \"talking than battles\"...ironic since it is a death game, but the atmosphere and mood of the anime was a helpful disguise to mask it and really did it quite well so LA won't criticize it too much because of it.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of voice acting, well we got an exceptional list of voice actors here and listing them would take soo long, overall LA would just say that the voice acting was top notch with some special mention to Aya Hirano as Monaka Touwa, Toshiyuki Morikawa as Munakata and probably the best playing against the type role of Saki Fujita as the mad chemist Seiko. Ohh right LA forgot about the change up in voice actors for Monokuma, due to Nobuyo Ooyama's dementia, they had gotten Tarako for Mirai-hen and really...Tarako did an ok job as Monokuma, LA couldn't say much about Monokuma considering that Monokuma HARDLY appears in Mirai-hen, nonetheless Tarako was \"ok\" for the most part as Monokuma. If LA had to really pick best voice actor in Mirai-hen...it goes to Toshiyuki Morikawa...without a doubt.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending if anything brought about a rather anti-climax, but will be hopefully taken up by Kibou-hen. But for Mirai-hen's ending, yes the \"mastermind\" was found out as well as the \"traitor\" and \"pawns\" in this death game, in terms of themes, it's kinda ironic how it leads, pitting despair and hope together, where throughout the anime despair formed into hope, but by the end, it seems that hope will morph into despair, there is ALWAYS despair and hope, one can't live without the other and eliminating either of them will cause unintentional or intentional chaos. If anything even when LA found out who the culprit was and a meta-textual Junko and Chisa outright how the events of Mirai-hen occurred to make all this happen...LA IS STILL SKEPTICAL that \"that's it\", it's not like Danganronpa to outright tell us information like this soo easily without hiding some red herrings to double dupe us. Well if this ending IS TRUE really LA calls it an anti-climax because LA thinks that the TRUE finale is in the finale of finale's Kibou-hen, this ending is just a taste of what's to come. LA is SOO HOPEFUL right now.\\n\\n\r\nMirai-hen being the finale of the entire series of Danganronpa does what it's meant to do, pit hope against hope to see which one will go on to the future and watching both Mirai-hen and Zetsubou-hen in conjunction with one another just made the mystery of the traitor, character development of the newer characters, not only was the 2 animes of Danganronpa within the same season something rather uniquely done and presented, but executed quite well and quite honestly seeing Danganronpa's final chapters was something both to praise about and weep for as it's finally ending in the most bloody ways possible with it bringing in near impossible murder mysteries and homicidal robot bears and zany and eccentric characters. LA was thankful that not only were there gonna be 2 animes of Danganronpa but that even Mirai-hen on it's own satisfying LA's craving for more Danganronpa and Mirai-hen took that expectations and easily exceeded LA's expectation for it (even with that rather anti-climax of an ending)...and even more once Hope arc arrives for the finale to end all finale's!!!",

            "content": "So, Danganronpa 3: The End of Kibougamine Gakuen - Mirai-hen ends, what used to be a game, ends, so what can I say about this sequel??????????\r\nStorywise, I gave it an outstanding 10 over 10, since the genre really did played out, as indicated, the plot was basically a hope vs despair theme as the first \"Danganronpa: Kibou no Gakuen to Zetsubou no Koukousei The Animation\" ( don't include the prequel pls). And just like the frist sequel the story also played us audience as well, where one might think that the anime was more of a repeat of the first sequel , but was not........itreally almost fooled us, kudos to the creator:  Spike Chunsoft, whoever he or she is. FU, FU, FU, FU!\\n\\n\r\nArt, well I don't have much to say about it since the only thing that have change was the character's attire, I'm referring to Kirigiri, Aoi and Negai, the rest......well, except for Munakata, Tenga, Juzo and  Chisa, who all wore the appropriate  attires, were just too damned silly, and I can never understand as what up with Seiko wearing a dorky surgical mask, Miaya, being in a wheelchair, even thought she's an android, and,Gozu with that bull mask. However I'm giving a 6 over 10 for Komaru's fanservice, FU, FU, FU, FUUUU!!!!\\n\\n\r\nSound, it's a 5 over 10, since the seiyuu's who did the character's voice were still the same.....for the major character's that is. FU, FU, FU, FUUUU!!!!!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter, ok, this is the part were a mensa member would wanna give the original creator  Spike Chunsoft and director Kishi, Seiji a lotta lambasting for insulting talented people for using the term \"super level\", in fact they would see that the character's represent the kind of foolishness of not being able to tell apart as to what is , talent, virtue, slot, vanity, oddity and the  bizarre, so let's group them:\\n\\n\r\nNegai Makoto and Junko Enoshima: one is a specified as a Super High School Level Luck/ hope and the other is  Super High School Level Fashion Girl/ despair/ psychopath weren't to be consider as such since their other title despair and hope are virtues not talent, also Junko is a loca, so she should be having the title super level psychopath. Negai, being this super level luck. should just be consider as \"The Protagonist\" without any of the super level bullshit.\\n\\n\r\n Bandai, Daisaku and Yasuhiro Hagakure, whatever super level bullshit they are, are just a bunch of super level dorksters with no function at all........I can't say the same in the videogames, since I don't have such luxury of having it.\\n\\n\r\nMunakata Kyouske and Juzo Sakakura, were nothing more than a bunch of super level bullies, whom themselves were against the others and eventually begun being against with each other.\\n\\n\r\nKizakura, Kouichi and Tenga Kazu, were just a couple of old geezers, that were meant for retirement....to their grave.\\n\\n\r\nIzayoi Sonosuke and Andou Ruruka, one is a treacherous manipulative bitch and the other is a protective ass, who is just as stupid for allowing himself to be killed by his manipulative bitch. \\n\\n\r\nYukizome, Chisa, MItarai and Seiko Kimura , I meant, really, these guys are super level at something one is a super level pharmacist and the other is a super level Housekeeper? Can it get more odd than this , since both of them were super level suckers? And that's what they are. Seiko Kimura would ask as to where did her friendship with Andou went wrong? Well, it went wrong the moment she met her, dang stupid character. Yukizone as aSuper Level House keeper???????Man, I can do the same jobs as she does, and really, a mensa member has all the right to criticize the creator, Spike Chunsoft . Mitarai....is pretty much a super level pussy.\\n\\n\r\nAnd lest's not forget Komaru and Toko, can be considers as the ultimate lesbian lovers. The rest like  Kirigiri, Aoi, Gekokgahara and Monaca and Gozu, were the protagonist's support, I also give this category a low score since they killed off Kirigiri instead of the ultimate bimbo Aoi. Kirigiri has more substance than Aoi, so why should she be killed off , that is the question. And I hate that she's being killed off. So the character assignment was just soo poor and it's a 3 over 10, FU, FU, FU! Btw, nice to see Togami again.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, well it was a good 7 over 10, since it was enjoyable, but not that good cu'z why???????????Oh yeah , cu'z they killed off Kirigiri and this anime was left with an open ending for the other sequel...the hope arc that is.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall it's a fair 6, on to the hope arc.......\\n\\n\\n\r\nFu, Fu, Fu........\\n\\n",

            "content": "I'm going to kind of melt in Future and Despair side, as they are intended to be watched at the same time, but I'm mostly directing my attention to Future.\r\nI used to be a big Danganronpa fan. I got the VITA for the sole purpose of playing the games, when SDR2 was only getting translated by some random people on the internet and the first game had just gotten localized. I've spent a lot of my time on Danganronpa, analyzing it, doing fanarts, discussing theories with other people, reading the fan-translated novels, playing Ultra Despair Girls, and although it had some flaws, I really theDanganronpa series overall.\\n\\n\r\nBut when I knew that they announced an anime, I just had this bad feeling. Danganronpa: The Animation wasn't really good, as the quantity of episodes was just not enough for the hole plot and it tried to fit like 20+ hours of gameplay in 13 episodes of approximately 25 minutes. 20+ of gameplay, details, plot, characters, into less than 6 hours approximately of an animation. And obviously, the adaptation wasn't really the best. But I thought, \"Hey, they won't make the same mistake twice. Besides, two arcs? That's a total of 24 episodes, so maybe it will be different!\"\\n\\n\r\nOh, how wrong I was.\\n\\n\r\nBoth despair and future side just tried to throw in a bowl and mix a lot of characters, random plot ideas, deaths with no meaning, and terrible death flags that screamed \"hey lol i'm gonna die now\". One of the major things about Danganronpa that I liked was how ridiculous, yet interesting the plot twists were. Even if you expected some of them, it was interesting to see how the dots connected, the contradictions, the solutions, and the characters going through that trip to the truth. And sometimes the twist would make you go \"holy shit\", because you didn't really get to see them coming.\\n\\n\r\nDanganronpa 3 didn't include any of those. Instead, the supposedly \"plot twists\" were so predictable, they basically screamed to your face \"enjoy this characters because we are going to kill it\". All the raising of death flags was painful to see, it felt like watching a Blue's Clues episode of how obvious everything was. A lot of cheap and mediocre tactics to get the ratings up, including unnecessary weird fanservice (although I kind of can let that pass because almost all animes do that), fake deaths of loved characters to keep the \"cliffhanger up\", and most of the \"cliffhangesr\" were basically thrown out to hell next episodes as they killed the hype.\\n\\n\r\nThe new cast was basically introduced to just fill the background. There was almost no major development except for a few things, but most of them were just to basically boost up the stage for survivors of DR1, specially Naegi, who doesn't really change a lot and gets very repetitive. And there was almost no development on characters, mostly just good designs but empty shells. They just tried to throw plot ideas that ended up contradicting the canon stuff, forgot about some of the novels, and a lot of other pointless stuff. And the ending was literally out of Danganronpa's character. No bittersweet, no guilt, no sadness to see. Only a rainbow colored happy world, contradicting so much stuff, done for only fanservice and to end the \"kibougamine arc\" (which will be probably be brought back again anyways, as there's even an OVA coming with the new game).\\n\\n\r\nThe anime just killed the essence of Danganronpa itself. No surprises, no cliffhangers, no plot twists, no character development. Just a terrible ripoff of Dora the Explorer with murder and some crappy hope vs despair plot.",

            "content": "(WARNING! THE ENTIRETY OF DANGANRONPA 3 WILL BE REVIEWED! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED)\r\nHard to believe that a Visual Novel would have this level of success, isn\u2019t it?\r\nNow, Visual Novels getting anime adaptations isn\u2019t anything new. Ace Attorney had one, Fate/Stay Night had a bunch of them, Steins; Gates\u2026 you get the point, really. What is definitely unique, however, is that the ending of a grand, overarching storyline that has been going on for years, from multiple forms of media such as Visual Novels, Light Novels or even traditional videogames, would have its finale in an anime-original storyline. That, my friends, is Danganronpa 3: THE ENDOF Kib\u014dgamine Gakuen.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is unique in its structure. When it was released, it was technically two shows at once, Mirai-Hen (Future Chapter) and Zetsubou-Hen (Despair Chapter), with you needing to watch a Mirai-Hen episode and then its Zetsubou-Hen counterpart. Once both shows are done with, a Special appropriately called Kibou-Hen (Hope Chapter). It\u2019s definitely unique to say the least. But, does that make it a good show? Well, that\u2019s what we\u2019re about to find out\u2026\\n\\n\r\n\u2026 But before we do, I need to explain something. As some of you might have seen in my previous reviews, I have a tendency to review multiple seasons of a show at once, or in some cases, entire series of movies. However, other times I have given the other season its own review. This is mostly because, when writing these reviews, I ask myself one question: \u201cWhat can I add by making a second review?\u201d. Unless the shift in quality between seasons is too noticeable, or there is enough material to talk about in the latter season (Or movies) that is open for discussion, I will only do one review. I just wanted to get that out of the way. Anyhow, let the final killing game begin:\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nSet sometime after the events of Super Danganronpa 2, the show serves as the grand finale to the plot that\u2019s been going on since the first game. That said, this anime has two goals, and this is where the genius of having two separate shows comes in. Its first goal was to finish the story of the survivors of the DR1 Killing Game. We got some of that in SDR2, but only Naegi, Togami and Kirigiri actually appeared in it. As such, Mirai-Hen is about them (And also Hagakure, Asahina, Fukawa and Naegi\u2019s little sister Komaru) facing their final challenge as they try to uncover what the hell is going on and just who the hell is the true mastermind.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the other goal this show had is to explain just what the hell happened that led up to the events of the first game to begin with. Again, we got some of that in SDR2, but only the basics. That\u2019s Zetsubou-Hen\u2019s goal.\\n\\n\r\nBoth succeed at this greatly, through different means. Mirai-Hen has a constant feeling of pressure. Everyone wants Naegi dead, and they\u2019re gonna do whatever they can to have him dead. It all makes for an unconformable and tension filled atmosphere. Zetsubou-Hen also has this, but that one manages to do that through paranoia. We know for a fact that things will go to hell, but the question is: How? And more importantly, when?\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s not to say it\u2019s perfect, though. Zetsubou-Hen in particular has some\u2026 questionable twists and a rather blatant case of Deus Ex Machina involving Komaeda (That doesn\u2019t involve bagels). On the other hand, Mirai-Hen has some equally dumb twists, most of them revolving around the new mastermind.\\n\\n\r\nNow, you might have noticed that I haven\u2019t mentioned Kibou-Hen at any point. And if you see my Anime List, you will also notice that it has a lower score than the other two chapters. That\u2019s mostly because the ending is honestly a bit of an anticlimax, with the DR1 cast getting barely anything to do in it. That said, I did ultimately like it, because it fits with the themes of rising up from despair seen thought the series, and it\u2019s also nice to have some well-deserved happiness for the cast. So overall, DR3 isn\u2019t perfect, but it\u2019s still great.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe cast is huge, as you would expect. The SDR2 cast doesn\u2019t get much development (Aside from Hinata and Nanami) but I do appreciate their inclusion here and I do think this is a fitting end to their stories. No, the real meat of this cast is the returning DR1 and UDG characters alongside a few of the newcomers. Naegi in particular goes through a lot in this anime. His own pacifistic nature bites him on his ass constantly, yet it still ultimately shows why his admittedly na\u00efve idealism is one of the few things that\u2019s allowed him to stay sane.\\n\\n\r\nHe also gains a pretty good rival in the form of Munakata Kyosuke. This guy is effectively Kyosuke Nanbu, but with the grumpiness somehow taken up to eleven (They\u2019re even voiced by the same guy). He\u2019s cynical, extremist, grumpy, yet at the same time, you can\u2019t help but feel sympathy for him given all of the crap that happens to him. I think my favorite of the new characters, however, ended up being Sakakura Juzo, Munakata\u2019s right hand man and best friend. Like Munakata, he\u2019s a dick of epic proportions. Yet at the same time, his hatred for Naegi is ultimately justified, and there\u2019s a twist involving him that I won\u2019t even dare spoil due to how utterly ridiculous yet genius it is.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast is also pretty good, but I don\u2019t have much else to talk about, really. So let\u2019s move on to\u2026\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\\n\r\nThe show looks pretty good all things considered. Mind you, this isn\u2019t some kind of fighting centred show that needs stellar animation, but it does look pretty good. I love the way that they made both Chapters distinct from each other. Zetsubou-Hen is more or less a standard translation of the VN\u2019s art-style to an anime, with all of the color and censored blood you\u2019d expect. On the other hand, Mirai-Hen\u2019s colors are more visually saturated, with the gray filter greatly helping with that. Hell, the blood isn\u2019t even censored anymore. Overall, the show looks pretty decent.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nOnce again, Takada Masafumi graces us with his glorious soundtrack. I don\u2019t even know what to say, really. The few returning songs are glorious, and the same goes for the new ones. As for the Openings and Endings, I love them. Both \u201cDEAD OR LIE\u201d and \u201cRecall THE END\u201d do a great job setting up Mirai-Hen\u2019s dark atmosphere, whereas \u201cKami-Iro Awase\u201d and \u201cZettai Kibou Birthday\u201d do a better job setting up Zetsubou-Hen\u2019s more immediately uplifting yet mysterious tone, even if the lyrics of the latter make absolutely no sense, even from the point of view that those are Komaeda\u2019s thoughts.\\n\\n\r\nVoice Acting:\\n\\n\r\nThe whole cast of the previous outings bar one come back and do an outstanding job as always. Ogata Megumi and Takayama Minami both do an outstanding job, with them having the additional task of having to play two characters each, yet making them sound so distinct from each other. Morikawa Toshiyuki and Suwabe Junichi also do an excellent job as Munakata and Sakakura. And of course there\u2019s Toyoguchi Megumi delivering her usual brand of crazy as Enoshima. And that\u2019s not even mentioning everyone else, from Hisaka Yoko, Ishida Akira, Miyake Kenta, Hanazawa Kana, Matsukaze Masaya, Sawashiro Miyuki and so many more.\\n\\n\r\nNow, remember that I mentioned one actor didn\u2019t come back? Well, sadly it had to be Monokuma\u2019s Actress, Ouyama Nobuyo. She was diagnosed with dementia some time before the anime came out and had to step down from the role as a result. Thankfully, they got former Zero Escape Alumni Takaro to take over the role, and while she may not be as good as Ouyama, she more than delivers in the essential areas.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nSo yes, I loved this show. It wasn\u2019t perfect, but I don\u2019t think it needs to be. It may not be as good as SDR2 or especially New Danganronpa V3 (My all-time favorite Visual Novel), but those are some pretty high standards. This show did what it was suposeed to, and did so marvelously. I highly recommend watching this show\u2026 just make sure to play everything else except V3 before you do so, or you\u2019re gonna have spoilers shoved up your ass.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score for Danganronpa 3 as a whole: 9/10",

Well, you can go forward from the first Danganronpa anime, that's ok, but if you wanna enjoy the 2 arcs of this last story it's recommended at least, Super Danganronpa 2 to be played.\r\nAnother recommendation if you gonna start the anime, it's see a chapter of this arc and 1 of the despair one, and repeat the process for better understanding.\r\nLet's start, we got to the point to at last see a end of the situations involving hope and despair with its roots at Kibougamine Gakuen painting an end... This anime gonna start at theend of Super Danganronpa 2 (They gonna fill you up in some details needed in this story, if you don't play the game) with our very proud and powerful lucky student, Naegi Makoto being putting in scene in a new mutual killing game with less time and more ferocious Ultimate Students, former ones, the Future Foundation itself, and the usual, but maybe less powerful Monokuma.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, the characters, as always, very rare talents attached to very rare people again, they are cool in a sense, but well, they gonna end dead at the very end, but belive me, they all are ultimates, so they are special, you don't gonna be bored with their actions.\\n\\n\r\nSecond, the story, this maybe could get very tedious, because, after hear hope, hope, hope, hope, in a game, and an anime before, you think it's enough, but this is the end, so, bear it again, please... the flow, it's more like a premises of the future with the need of a connection of the past to still keep forward (Zetsubou-hen), even so, the flow of the characters, the situations, the revelations that get connections at this very point to get an end, that is the real flavor of this story, its very meaning, a very cool one, because the new mystery of the killings it's easy but you are here for answers, of course.\\n\\n\r\nAnd third, the music and CG, have very much connection with the first story, so you gonna still hear the usual BGMs and sounds, with the Psycho Pop style of Danganronpa with more elegance and technology, well, Psycho-Technology, rare, but that make it great.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end you need this and the despair one, to end this at the Kibou-Hen, so it's a good anime, a good story, necessary to fill us up with its answers altogether with the other arc, maybe we expect something different, but when you reach the end of each arc, you see the meaning and good synergy of this last track of the path.\\n\\n\r\nIf you reach this part of the review, feeling this useful or maybe nothing at all... anyway, thank you so much for your time, and happy anime, may the hope protect you from the despair, pupupupu.",

            "content": "Danganronpa 3 Future has become a mixed bag for fans for the franchise.  Even when it was announced that it would be a anime instead of a game, there were doubts that this could be done well.  What didn't help is that it would only have 12 episodes for this side alone.  After watching it, indeed certain things in the overall narrative didn't quite click well.\r\nBefore watching this, playing DR:  Trigger Happy Havoc, Super DR2: Goodbye Island of Despair and DR Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls is required.  Also, alongside Side Future is DR Side Despair, which viewers are meantto watch side by side.\\n\\n\r\nFirst off, most of the criticisms stem from the format.  This franchise started as a series of games that average at least 20 hours of gameplay.  The conclusion of the series being one 12 episode series, an 11 episode series that ties into it, and a sequel special that will tie up both series and overall would only take up atleast 10 hours brought up some concerns.  With at least 16 characters, even with at least 4 already known, the limited time along with the usual content of the series gave doubts whether the characters would be given a decent amount of screentime and characterization.  Despair side picked up some slack in that regard by relegating time to give further exposition for the new characters, which also opened up problems as well for that series.\\n\\n\r\nIt also didn't help that at the beginning, the new characters come off as unlikable right from the start.  The story starts off after the events of Super Danganronpa 2, in which Makoto Naegi, the protagonist of the first game and taking up the protagonist role again here,  is being tried for his actions in trying to save the Remnants of Despair from being executed by the Future Foundation, and undo the influence Junko Enoshima has done to them.  Now, Makoto, as a member of Future Foundation, it is reasonable for him to be held accountable for his actions that were out of his own sense of morality but were against the organization's as a whole.  What was not is that the heads of Future Foundation holding him on trial weren't being reasonable in the slightest and are outright antagonistic towards him from the start.\\n\\n\r\nIt's reasonable that one or two would make claims that he's a traitor, but it's the opposite in that only a few aren't immediately jumping to conclusions, and the majority already made their decisions about it, hinting that the trial would have been against Makoto from the start, if things didn't go to hell before it properly started.  It's stupid.  The audience knows Makoto was acting on good intentions.  To have the new characters from the start be against him would already make them less receptive.  However even after they get trapped and put into a killing game, many of them still act unreasonable as they automatically assume Makoto is the one responsible for this and start trying to kill him right off the bat.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the actually likeable characters or the ones that didn't automatically come across as jerks from the new cast are the ones that start getting killed off.  It's easy to determine who's going to die because it's always the one that's given focus the same episode.  You, the viewer, start to find this character interesting only for them to be killed off abruptly before the episode's end, leaving the unlikable ones around to create conflict.  This was intended so they could redeem themselves in some way near the end, but it's divided whether the payoff was worth it.  I actually grew to like Munakata even though he was the one mainly responsible for the string of irrational decisions that started most of the conflict in the series.  Sakakura was still a mixed bag for me though he did become a more fleshed out character.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 7 was a episode that could have been better used to focus on other things.  The main story is replaced by a related but separate incident that would have been better left as a \"leave to your imagination\" only getting the critical parts of it.  The plot focuses on the plotline from Ultra Despair Girls and I really liked some of the fanservice in that episode.  Still, from a narrative perspective, it's only slightly related to the main plot.  All it really does is drop a death flag for a DR1 character.  The cost wasn't worth it.  The character that was the main antagonist in that game and was revealed to be participating in the current killing game via robot masquerading as one of the FF branch heads turns out to be red herring, and she gives up right in the middle of the episode.  She literally self-destructs all her robots herself for no reason.  That it was a troll in the end did not sit well, and personally was disappointing for me, since I really like Ultra Despair Girls and didn't like the episode making one big joke out of it.  And precious time that could have been used on something more relevant was instead used for this kind of fake out.\\n\\n\r\nWhat turns out to be critical for Future's plot is certain characters, and if they aren't done well, they will damage the series as a whole.  First is Chisa Yukizome, whose importance is affected by her role in Side Despair, and what happens to her.  She was the teacher of the 77th class that became Super High School Level Despair, and she in turn was brainwashed like them by association.  Once this is revealed in Side Despair, the truth becomes she was still brainwashed in Future arc, and was the reason the vice-chairman had become so irrational by her doing heinous crimes, then showing them to him while hiding the fact she did it, and influencing him to be more extreme in his beliefs.\\n\\n\r\nShe also turns out to be the one to have given this series' mastermind the means to do the killing game. The way this was handled was less well done.  She literally just gives the mastermind the Macguffin without any more context whether or not the situation at the time fit or not, especially when who the mastermind turns out to be.  That moment sums up her fatal flaw, in that she's less of a character but a plot device to railroad the plot when needed or in this case, explain how the mastermind got a certain thing.  It's not even hidden; during one moment in both series, she exclaims because of her talent, she's lead to important moments.  Anything the viewer may have liked about her is gone once she's brainwashed making her role in the story more apparent.\\n\\n\r\nNext is the mastermind, who turns out be a character who died during the events of the series.  This person turns out to be the chairman of Future Foundation, Kazuo Tengan.  And the reasons why he set up this killing game relates to another character, who I will mention next.  His motives turn out to be to get this person to use something he had.  The problem is that the person was also part of the killing game, meaning that person was in danger of dying.  Questions are raised why he didn't guarantee that person's safety.  Why of all things he set up killing game to influence that person to use the Macguffin.  And if that person wasn't supposed to be there originally for the events, then how and why did he end up being there.  It's left to interpretation so far, maybe to be clarified in the special.\\n\\n\r\nLastly is Ryota Mitarai.  He is key to this entire anime, both sides of it, leaving him a very divisive character, and one that really needed to be done right.  His talent is as an animator.  His dream was making an anime to inspire hope in others just as he had been.  It all goes wrong once he turns to using subliminal messaging and other brainwashing techniques in his work and he encounters Junko Enoshima, who twists his work for her purposes, used it to brainwash Chisa and the 77th class to spread despair, and the reserve course students to commit suicide, setting off the end of world.  This leaves him very guilt ridden that carries over to the Future arc.  After these events were presented in Despair arc, he becomes a sympathetic character.  However, this somewhat diminishes after it turns out he made another video to brainwash people to spread hope, what Tengan wanted to push him to use and now after all this, he's now resolved to use it by uploading it to all communication devices.  Even though Tengan was the mastermind, Ryota is now the true final boss.  Not to be resolved in Future arc though, but in the Hope arc.  Yes, the finale of this series ends on a cliffhanger to resolve all the plotlines in a special.\\n\\n\r\nThe fact all the events so far lead up to this is underwhelming.  In the end, it's more brainwashing from the Despair arc, that was divisive from the start.  Also, more importantly, Ryota turns out to not learn anything, and now, he needs to be stopped. What's worse is that from the start of Future arc, he is just there.  No reason exists for him being in this side of the story until this moment.  You'd hope his first major act to be aligned with the protagonist and not against him, making all this build up to be a waste, because Ryota isn't even a true antagonist.  He's just misguided, engulfed by his guilt and weakness, and projecting it onto the world.  Making the final confrontation to be convincing him to not to follow through because it would be a mistake.  That's just disappointing and wasn't worth being the climax of the series.  If it turned out Tengan stole the Hope video, did broadcast the killing game, and set up for the video to be broadcasted afterwards, requiring Ryota to stop it, with previous episodes giving him character development, that would be easier to accept.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I did enjoy this, in fact I enjoyed this more than Despair arc.  I do understand why Spike Chunsoft wanted to end this storyline in an anime.  Makoto and the rest of the DR1 characters shouldn't have been in anymore class trials; they're past that.  Now, would it have been better instead of an anime, Spike Chunsoft make a game with different gameplay elements to compensate that?  Probably, but I'd imagine that would be difficult.  Also despite my criticisms, I'm looking forward to see how it all ends in the Side Hope special.",

I cried alot of times. A lot of people hated the end of Mirai-hen but I found it brilliant because it's a really interesting idea Kodaka got.\\n\\n\r\nArt : 8/10\\n\\n\r\nNothing really exceptional, nothing really bad. The animation is really good. I don't have a lot to say.\\n\\n\r\nSound : 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe OST is really good but thumbs up for the opening and the ending which are for me one of the best (especially the ending). They are really beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 9/10 \\n\\n\r\nEvery characters are interesting, thanks to Zetsubou-hen which takes place in the past, before the start of DR1, you learn a lot about the new characters (Seiko, Ruruka, Izayoi, Munakata, Ryota and some more). You easily understand why they are doing what they are doing and you are really moved when something happens to them. For the DR1 survivors, they are really great and Kyoko got even more character development.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI don't even know how to describe every emotions I got when watching this anime : sadness, happiness, fear, angst...just wow.\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 10/10\\n\\n\r\nA lot of people will disagree but I don't care, for me DR3 is one of the best things I have ever seen in terms of story, sound or characters. A masterpiece.",

Its the perfect blend of action and psychological action. If only it didn't emphasize on hope and despair so much. We get it, Naegi is \"Ultimate Hope\" and so forth, but it just forces those two words around and around and around. It goes from trying to but despair as the overlapping theme to just full out \"despair, \u7d76\u671b. despair, \u7d76\u671b, despair, \u5e0c\u671b, hope , despair, and so on. Itjust made the anime a bit less entertaining. Overall, this anime was one of my top 10 anime of the season,  maybe even number 1. I strongly suggest this anime to a lot of fans out there who are looking for good and action-packed anime.",

Danganronpa 3 is basically the sequel of the first two games, unless you watched/played the games then you'll end up being clueless or lost. \r\nStory:\r\nThe story already explained what happened after the second game, Naegi was punished for saving the remnants of despair. Then we get a new killing game with FF members. Some parts of the story are connected to the other games like Ultra Despair Girls or the second game.\r\nArt:\r\nIt looks decent, but It got darker when they changed the blood color to red. The opening looks really edgy and shows the viewers thatthere will be deaths in the show.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nIt as the appropriate sound effects, like characters getting stabbed or like Chisa's corpse falling down from the chandelier.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe new characters like Juzo or the smiling guy died too early. It would be better if we knew a short background about them, Munakata & boxer guy doesn't make sense and attempts to kill Naegi for freeing the Remnants of Despair. For Ruruka, she doesn't have any redeeming qualities (as much as I want to like her).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI enjoyed the whole anime for a Danganronpa fan, it was a good sequel for the first two games.

            "content": "Danganronpa 3: The End of Kibougamine Gakuen - Mirai-hen Review\r\n_______________________________________________________\r\nI have included a tl;dr near the bottom of this review if the length is too long. \r\nDisclaimer: I have played both the Danganronpa 1 and 2 games to completion and have been following the series for years. (For reference, I would probably give the games about a 6/10) THIS REVIEW WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS FOR THIS SERIES AND MINOR SPOILERS FOR THE GAMES.\r\nIf a mystery is a typical \"whodunnit\" (as DR3 is), it sometimes relies a bit too much on the inevitable twist of the reveal of the culprit. However, it only requires a shift inperspective to create a quality story and to not become another entry into the dreaded \"mystery box\" genre. I have never been the biggest fan of mysteries in general because the mystery alone usually isn't enough to create an engaging narrative, and I feel this is how most genre contemporaries present themselves. Even the ones that don't struggle to make thoroughly enticing mystery-based stories because they usually won't leave much of an impression unless they blow your fucking mind to smithereens. It's a flawed, finicky genre to me because whenever I come across a mystery with decent/good characters, the mysteries always end up lackluster, and vice versa. Basically, the mystery shows I do like have elements that appeal to me other than the feeling of \"Oooh, what's gonna happen?? Maybe something interesting in the future!\" Historically, Danganronpa is a series that tries not to fall into this trap by having a wide array of characters, cool settings, and exciting court cases. I don't think the games are anything special, but they are competent enough to have some fun with. It's when the adaptation of the first Danganronpa game came out that the problems with the story and characters were enhanced twofold and made incredibly apparent. Plot holes arising from removed dialogue, one-note characters who die without garnering any sympathy and poor characterization for the ones that remain alive, mind-boggling pacing, and it just felt like sitting around waiting for interesting things to happen only to realize that they never will. It really sucked. However, after some time passed, Danganronpa 3 was announced. It was touted as a completely original project designed to end the story of the first two games, meaning they had significantly more creative freedom to work with. Gone are the days of attempting to cram 30+ hours of content into 13 regular-sized episodes. Suffice to say, despite its best efforts, Danganronpa 3 Future Arc fails to impress. It so woefully falls flat in every area that it makes the entire series look like a joke, and if this is how the series is going to end, then I am painfully let down. How this has little in the way of negative reviews at the time of this writing and even held an average score above an 8 on MAL (which is what some of my favorites don't even get) for a long period of time makes no sense to me.\\n\\n\r\nAnd yeah, this show falls into every possible trap regarding bad mystery stories. It's boring, spins its wheels, has lame characters, and is ridiculously stupid. However, if it were that simple, I wouldn't be writing this review. I'm going to get to the bottom of the mystery within a mystery: what happened to Danganronpa?\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s begin with talking about the thing that immediately struck me as terrible - the presentation. The color design is truly abysmal, with the dominant colors being black, gray, brown, and a disgusting shade of red that pervades through certain parts. A show so inundated with lifeless scenes of characters standing around talking is bound to be much more interesting with this lovely palette applied. Unfortunately, the area the characters inhabit while standing in a bunch of dark, empty rooms and hallways may be the main culprit of the horrible visual design. Somewhere along the line, I\u2019m sure a decision was made to make Danganronpa 3 \u201cdarker\u201d than previous installments, because it is the conclusion after all. While I believe this only applied in the literal sense with the final product, they did make the blood red, which finally makes Danganronpa the mature series I\u2019ve been waiting for. However, it\u2019s possible that after they spent a hundred painstaking hours using the paint bucket tool on the splashes of blood, they forgot to make the setting something other than a gray mass of boring concrete. While the art design in the Danganronpa games is not exceptional, I at least felt like I \u201cknew\u201d the location I was in, and the scenery was usually quite unique depending on where you were in the school or the island. It's true that this it's easier to evoke this feeling in a game, but it's not unheard of to use directing tricks and good shot composition to communicate the setting through the visuals. but DR3 just doesn't do this. The director, Kishi Seiji, is rather hit-or-miss for me. I don't care for Yuuki Yuuna, Persona 4, Seto no Hanayome, or Carnival Phantasm, and nor did I find the directing in any of those shows particularly standout. But I do like Angel Beats, and Humanity has Declined is one of my favorite shows of all time. Even then, the directing in these shows is one of their weaker elements, especially Humanity has Declined (it's still good, though), which could have benefited from a more unconventional style. Why any of this matters is because I think it proves Seiji alone probably doesn't have the means to salvage a show with a terrible script and weak art direction. The camera angles and constant uses of bland panning shots and character zoom-ins illustrate that Seiji was constricted by the claustrophobic nature of DR3's setting. However, take everything I've said with a grain of salt because I don't believe it's easy to place the blame on anyone involved with an anime's production. To continue a bit further, (this is almost equally the fault of the writing), the sense of space between characters is conveyed so poorly it's practically a non-entity, removing any tension and making the murders that happen unbelievably dull. There's no standout scenery or any kind of important landmarks to help alleviate this, further disengaging me as a viewer. There was a clear lack of creative vision with this show, which is made blindingly obvious through the absence of any cohesiveness or suspense in its presentation. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is not impressive, or fluid in the slightest, even during key moments when characters are fighting or whatever, and I really hate how the lighting is occasionally too dark to clearly see what's going on. I, myself, have never been a huge fan of the DR art style, but even I think that the way it is converted into the anime format looks kind of ugly, especially the characters. I just can't stand their odd face shapes and strangely designed eyes, and this is amplified when they're moving. All of the aforementioned issues with the presentation combine to create a tedious viewing experience that only makes me think about how I could be better using my time. Basically, the idea that anyone can look at this series and get invested even the slightest bit is baffling to me, especially since this atrocious presentation is a pretty big reason that I can barely get through an episode without falling asleep. \\n\\n\r\nThe dialogue is laughably horrific. It's truly devoid of any creativity or flair, and is never enjoyable. Characters (though mostly Munakata) are given bafflingly stupid lines that often made me do a double-take and burst out laughing. I would go out of my way to provide some specific examples, but I don't exactly have the time, and it was something that was just apparent to me all throughout the series. All that results from the poor script is the reinforcement of the vacuous, unenjoyable presentation. And, even though I praised it for being unintentionally funny, whenever the show actually attempts comedy, it always comes up painfully flat. Isn't it hilarious that Naegi's sister might have incestuous feelings for him because that's a thing that's popular in anime right now?? Also, Hagakure's character is intended as comedic relief but, surprise, he just fails hard at it, and since this is his only purpose in the show, it quickly gets on my nerves. This might seem like a pedantic complaint, but I don't think it's necessarily wrong to ask for some kind of self-awareness in the writing, which it \"attempts\" to do, but it comes off as a mere wink and a nod to current trends more so than humor derived from the characters or the situations. Maybe this is because all of the characters are so unimaginably flat that it's hard to write any enjoyable scenes with them? Hmm...no way! Anyway, I always appreciate series that go out of their way to acknowledge their own ridiculousness, but DR3 sucks at doing this, resulting in a never-ending spiral of boredom.\\n\\n\r\nHere's a fun drinking game you can do with the script: take a shot every time a character says \"hope\" or \"despair.\" Actually, to prevent death by alcohol poisoning, you should just pick one of the words and have your buddy take the other. \\n\\n\r\nOh, and the soundtrack, at least from what I can remember, is comprised of reused or slightly remixed songs from the games, so who gives a shit about that. I'm not saying I dislike Danganronpa music, quite the opposite in fact, but the lack of originality just makes it all the more tiring to sit through.  \\n\\n\r\nSo if the series isn't nice to look at and nothing is presented in a compelling way, like, 100% of the time, its characters and plot must make up for it, right?! After all, Welcome to the N.H.K is a series that happens to have notoriously horrible and inconsistent visuals, but it still remains a great show because the other aspects hold it up so well. Now here's a revelation that's as predictable as any plot twist in this anime: this is not the case with DR3.\\n\\n\r\nI want to address my most hated plot device before delving into the characters and overarching story: Forbidden Actions. Here's the rundown: all the characters trapped inside the remains of the Future Foundation building have a cuff around their arms that dictates what actions they cannot see or do, and if they perform or witness said action, they die (almost) instantly. If you fail to comprehend why I believe this is so retarded, then let me explain: this is the writers blatantly including deus ex machinas as a functioning component of the story. By the way, the audience is NOT made aware of every characters' Forbidden Actions, and in fact, viewers are intentionally left in the dark on this. Why? If this was an attempt to add tension, it actually has the opposite effect. There's nothing gratifying whatsoever in learning that someone's Forbidden Action happens to correlate to a scene that that character is a part of. They exist as nothing more than a device to conveniently kill characters whenever the writers think it's \"best\" to do so, which is one of the most obnoxious methods of stringing along that I've ever seen in a mystery story, and it only hurts the anime's endeavor to make me care about what's going on. Surprisingly, even though DR3 is going for a more serious tone, every single time Forbidden Actions are important or even mentioned at all, it results in unintentionally hilarious scenes. Like, holy shit, Naegi's Forbidden Action is that he can't run in the hallway, and he has to piggyback on one of the characters if there's anywhere he wants to go. Hahahaha, what the fuck? One character is killed off early on in order to showcase how deadly these Forbidden Actions can be, but his requirement came off as incredibly forced as a result of this. The chances of said Action not occurring were so low that his death was practically unavoidable. In contrast, I was certain, from the second Naegi's was revealed, that it would never become a problem at any point in the story. Enthralling. \\n\\n\r\nDanganronpa 3's characters were doomed to be fucking awful as soon as it was announced the run time for the series would be 12 episodes. Yeah, good luck developing those 15-20 relevant characters and/or making the audience even remotely care about them when they inevitably die. I guess for a lot of people, the fact that characters die is enough to make them tear up, but I hate any kind of story that hinges on this because it feels manipulative, like the story can't get me naturally endeared to its cast without resorting to sob stories and the constant threat of death. As it stands, DR3's cardboard cutouts masquerading as characters fail to interest or compel me to care. All of them can be boiled down to a single (less than compelling) personality trait, and whenever they try(emphasis on try) to show depth beyond that, they die without accomplishing anything. You know so little about them that whenever the show tries to \"subvert\" your expectations with regards to their actions, it's never surprising because you're given no reason to believe they couldn't do that. It's a very boring and lame way of handling characters because it just involves way too much stringing along, which is already highly prevalent in most mystery shows. I would slot every character into either \"obnoxious fuck-face\" or \"literally nothing\" anyway, and this, in addition to the overbearing grimdark tone, results in no scene ever being fun. All of this just makes the telegraphed deaths that much more annoying.\\n\\n\r\nAudience: Hmm, I wonder...this character is getting more lines of dialogue and screen time than normal...haha, I'm sure it's just a coincidence!\\n\\n\r\nTo add to my frustration even further, I just hate and can't make sense of most of the character's actions. To give an example, in episode 1, I found it insurmountably frustrating that Naegi wouldn't tell the Future Foundation why he held the Despairs captive and that he ran an experiment on them. How convenient that there's an overly angry guy there so that Naegi could be punched and have an excuse not to talk! Even worse than this, Munakata is a character that I just cannot understand no matter how hard I try. He seems to kill people at complete random and for no discernible reason, and screams really loudly about hope and despair because of his dead girlfriend (By the way, it's not just Munakata - none of the characters' motivations makes any sense). However, the scene that's the worst offender of complete and utter stupidity, and embodies all of my problems with the way characters act in this anime is the one in which (Spoiler) Ruruka kills Izayoi. The leaps in logic and sheer ridiculousness of this scene combined with the fact that it is taking itself 100% seriously makes me laugh so hard. It has absolutely no impact as an emotional scene, and both of the characters' attitudes and lines of thinking verge on complete insanity, resulting in a strange feeling where I not only feel no sympathy whatsoever, but I CANNOT bring myself to care no matter what. None of this is helped by the fact that not a single character feels like he/she has a life outside of the idiotic lines that they spew, making them painfully shallow and even harder to care for on closer inspection. I don't think it would be a stretch to say that there is no characterization in this show, because every characters' actions are hand-waved with DESPAIR. What can they do? They're in DESPAIR MODE after all.\\n\\n\r\nThe returning main characters remain stagnant throughout the episodes, making the experience even more dull than it needs to be. Yep, Naegi is still screaming about hope and people around him are still getting killed despite this. I would love to get behind his ideals, (that are practically a repeat of what they were in DR1) but the writers only make Naegi look like more of a dumbass since there are very few limitations to the death game. In DR1, Naegi's ideals of hope had significance since the \"death game\" actually had RULES and CONSEQUENCES. The characters don't actually want to kill each other, but it is promised that if they do, then they would be able to escape their despairing situation. This, in combination with some blackmailing by Monokuma makes it more believable that they might kill to achieve freedom, thereby creating a scenario where Naegi's \"hope\" has thematic relevance. In DR3 Future, everyone can just kill without any repercussions, and in fact, the whole event is treated like a free-for-all. Too bad every character is either a fucking insane person who doesn't mind killing people for the flimsiest of reasons, and/or a person who has a horrible gripe with someone else. If this wasn't the case, everyone would have to be human beings with relatable emotions and Naegi's morals might actually help the situation! What a shame. Now look, I'm not advocating for DR3 to have the exact same message that the original game does, but since they just copy-pasted the plot setup and general feel of the game, it only invites this kind of criticism. What the hell kind of message is it even going for if not this? As far as Kirigiri goes, she's basically worthless and gets completely relegated to the sidelines. Possible wasted potential? Eh, I don't care anyway.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo, the only logical conclusion that one can draw from what I've said is that DR3 is not character driven, right? Maybe the characters were only made to serve a narrative purpose in order to create a more compelling mystery plot. This is obviously totally wrong and there's no redeeming this piece of shit at this point, but let's perform an examination anyway.... \\n\\n\r\nI think it should be noted that class trials have been removed entirely. The gimmick created to \"compensate\" for this is as follows: at a certain time, every character except  ONE \"culprit\" is forcefully put to sleep. Aside from making the whole series really boring, I believe this gimmick is even more idiotic than at first glance. How the fuck is anyone supposed to figure out who did these murders? You can argue that the same thing would happen without this gimmick because a culprit would typically make his move after everyone is asleep, but I beg to differ. Every character's sleep is controlled, so I'm assuming that they cannot be woke as well. This removes certain variables that make mysteries interesting. Maybe one character doesn't sleep well, so he overhears something strange in the middle of the night. Maybe a character intentionally stays awake in order to observe whether or not someone does something suspicious. Call these things overly convenient, but they're still possibilities that can shake up a normal mystery and allow the audience to soak in fucking CLUES so they can solve it themselves. In DR3, the murderer and his victims come off as a half-assed attempt at adding some air of intrigue and mystery in the background, instead of being front-and-center like they SHOULD BE. The characters, including Kirigiri, the supposed \"Ultimate Detective,\" just sort of look at the victims and say \"Yeah, they're dead all right!\" and move on without dwelling on each murder. That's because there's nothing to analyze about them whatsoever. There is one point in episode 8 where Kirigiri actually conducts an investigation that yields results, but this was for the sole purpose of a \"riveting\" plot twist (involving Forbidden Actions LOL) where the killer was someone besides the \"actual\" culprit. So, as far as the culprit to each murder goes, no one could have possibly observed who did the murders, and unless the killer is completely stupid, no one will be able to figure it out. Why did they even make this mechanic a thing? It's like they intentionally didn't want there to be interesting investigations or cases. What's stopping the culprit from killing everyone? The rules are so un-specific when they really need to be otherwise plot holes like this will come up. I have honestly hurt my fucking brain trying to think of the logic behind this plot device, so I'll stop here.\\n\\n\r\nBy the way, I am aware of the plot twist at the end of the series, but my issue is how this controlled sleep thing weakens the mystery the show builds up by having numerous apparent flaws and just making everything boring. I already hate trying to figure out \"whodunnit,\" so I doubt I would like the story even without this plot device. My beef with it is how it forces obligatory murders to happen throughout the show and how solving the mystery is impossible, so why even include the plot device at all when it actively makes your death game show have no tension or intrigue. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of that plot twist, Despair Video anyone? How about a Hope Video? How about the worst idea ever? Oh wait, I repeated myself three times. Honestly, do I need to say why this is so stupid? I didn't care about anything by the time the Videos were revealed, so I was just laughing along at the practical joke that was the conclusion of Danganronpa 3. Do you even understand the implications of videos that instantly cause hope and despair? It's world-altering to the point that I'm sure this is going to be the only major source of conflict the Danganronpa series will use from now on. The hope and despair thing has already gotten out of hand, and they just promoted it to a world-class meme. Congrats, I had a few laughs, but in retrospect, it's not that funny. It severely cheapens Junko's character because it proves that she was not an influential, persuasive figure, but instead that she just used god powers to make everyone feel despair!!!! Lame. You know what the best Despair Video is? An episode of Danganronpa 3. \\n\\n\r\nWell, that's it. You should have a clear idea of what I hate about the show by now if you even bothered to read this far, so I'll just complain about minor plot details until the end of the review.\\n\\n\r\nIn order to drag you into my next point, let's just imagine a world where Munakata (the Future Foundation guy with a katana) is the culprit in one of the murders. Since law and order has been completely disposed of, there is no conceivable way anyone would be able to stop that guy from fucking killing everyone. He, along with a few other characters, seem to have incredible super strength the likes of which have never been seen in Danganronpa. No, actually, Sakura from DR1 had a crazy, over-the-top fight with Monokuma, but this could be justified since it was a one time occurrence and could be passed off as some sort of joke, and the fact that Sakura is the ULTIMATE WRESTLER. (Not to mention that this somewhat fits with the tone of the games. Just watch any execution to understand that DR has a bit of craziness to it) Munakata is the Ultimate STUDENT COUNCIL PRESIDENT. Wow, I didn't know that student council presidents were flame katana wielding badasses that have superhuman fighting prowess. These ridiculous fights that happen pretty frequently in DR3 have no real justification for why each character is so damn powerful. There's a character that can demolish a wall with his bare hands, and to justify this, they slapped Sakura's title of wrestler onto him. Wow, good thing he was killed off early or else he would have been a problem! According to the creators, this is supposed to be a \"darker\" take on Danganronpa, so why are there so many tension-less, over-the-top fights? I dunno, I guess it would be too boring if they all had to be rational, normal human beings, and this is an anime after all! LOL amirite??!!!\\n\\n\r\nAll I can say about the narrative of DR3 is that it is dumb. There's no real way to infer that this is going to be the finale of the entire series other than the fact that Monokuma himself says so. Why is this the final killing game? On that note, why did it even need to be a killing game? It's not like the people that are trapped are the only non-Despairs left; there are other branches of the Future Foundation out there with many people working in each of them. The anime does not attempt at setting any kind of stakes, yet the series is making this out like this is the biggest and most epic incident to ever happen to humanity. What about Togami's special military force and access to high-end technology and military weapons? I can't imagine any despairs accomplishing much with those in the way, even if the other Future Foundation branches somehow cease functions. Not to mention, there's a very high chance that multiple people are going to walk away from the death game alive and be able to resume leading the work of their branch of the Future Foundation, so this killing game seems like it has a 100% chance to accomplish....pretty much nothing. Viewers can only assume that the new person controlling Monokuma is a legitimate retard. \\n\\n\r\nThe series doesn't even bother having a real ending, either. The last few episodes are just a clusterfuck of random plot contrivances strung together in such a way that barely resembles a story topped off with massive plot holes that contradict the entire series (Junko mind control). There's little to say about the last couple episodes that I haven't already mentioned in this review other than they were incredibly boring and stupid and I hated every second of them (oh wait you could've guessed that). My brain was hazing over during the viewing of these episodes, so I apologize for the lack of an in-depth analysis on how the resolution actually makes no sense whatsoever. I honestly didn't give a fuck at this point. \\n\\n\r\nSo...what was the point of this anime? It has horrible characters, a mess of a plot, and is generally boring to watch thanks in part to the garbage presentation. As far as thematic elements go, it's incredibly weak as well. Although I don't particularly care all that much for the games' themes, they at least have purpose in furthering the story as well as giving it a sub-textual point, which is better than not having one. In DR3, the words \"hope\" and \"despair\" are spouted off with such reckless abandon that the whole project seems more so an effort to make the anime \"feel\" like Danganronpa than actually trying to integrate this theme into the story or add anything new to the mix. I got nothing meaningful out of any of the characters or their actions, or any underlying themes that aren't already present in the first two games. \\n\\n\r\nMaybe they just didn't know where to go with the series and decided to quickly shit out a conclusion. This is actually really accurate the more I think about it, especially after watching the ending of the series, Kibou-hen. It's the dream ending that every Danganronpa fan wanted. It ties everything together in such a perfectly neat little bow that many people probably thought it was the best thing ever. However, I believe it is wholly unsatisfying and only served to re-emphasize the weaknesses of the series. Nothing that happens in Kibou-hen feels like a natural course-of-progress. Everything is being pushed toward this one goal point that MUST be reached for some reason. It has no time to stop for a breather and let its audience care about what is going on. Characters are magically resurrected from the dead with a stupid, hand-waved explanation, making me wonder why they died in the first place. Scenes that are made out to be emotionally charged are nothing more than a joke due to the lack of focus and development. Characters do their one \"thing\" that they're known for, and show no depth beyond that. It all feels so hollow and decidedly not genuine. If this is the ending everyone wanted, then I hope you're all happy, but I personally would've liked some more thought put into how they would reach this point. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________\\n\r\nI've said most of what I wanted to say about DR3. So here is where I'll place my exceedingly minor, miscellaneous complaints about the series that I couldn't fit into the review and end it off afterwords.\\n\\n\r\nI severely dislike that Monokuma is given barely any lines in this anime. To me, he was one of the best parts of the games, and to a much smaller extent, the original anime. His dialogue was usually entertaining, and his attempts to stir up despair in each of the characters was neat. The fact that Monokuma barely says anything in DR3 illustrates that the writers were probably very lazy and didn't want to think up any creative things for him to say. Or maybe they felt he wasn't needed because the tone is darker...yeah....that's it.\\n\\n\r\nWhy is Hagakure even in this shit? He does literally nothing and is incredibly extraneous(actually I could say this about most characters, SHIT). It could have been interesting to handle a character who wasn't trapped within the building, especially since he was one of my favorites in the game, but they just seem to treat him as a joke since he just shits around doing nothing the whole series. What a masterful use of all available resources, DR3 writers!\\n\\n\r\nI almost completely forgot about Asahina, but I think it should be mentioned that her only role in DR3 is to act as Naegi's legs whenever he needs to run in a hallway. While this is funny, it also makes me believe that she didn't even need to stay alive because she's actually a super boring character. This could either be a fault of the writers generally being incompetent, or her character being too reliant on Sakura for any intrigue, or both. At least she wasn't a fanservice vehicle I guess? \\n\\n\r\nI don't really care about the subplot with Monaka. I didn't play Ultra Despair Girls because I think it looks like a shitty game, but I think her character was entirely unnecessary in the context of this anime. It doesn't help that the episode where she is the focus, episode 7, is probably one of the worst in the series due to the amount of unnecessary fanservice and general pointlessness of its plot. I guess her purpose was to be a misdirect by making you think she was the one who trapped everyone in the building, but this kind of fails to be convincing since they reveal her identity relatively early on. All she manages to do is take up an unneeded amount of screen time that all ends up being for naught in the end. However, I'll admit she is involved with what is probably the most entertaining scene in the whole show, if only for its absurdity. \\n\\n\r\nThe bullshit at the end of episode 8 LOL. The writers realized that Togami could just rescue them all so they ass-pulled super hard and made it so this couldn't happen. This made me burst out laughing.\\n\\n\r\nI hate how DR3 Future Arc relies on its companion series \"Despair Arc\" to develop its dead characters. Not only is it hard to care about them because you know they're dead, but they usually aren't given enough screen time to make an impact, which is somewhat due to their rushed portrayal, but also because there are so many characters to focus on. It's the same problem that Akame ga Kill has, where the increasing number of character deaths is proportional to the amount of not giving a fuck. To be honest, Despair Arc suffers from many of the same problems that Future Arc does. The only edge it has over Future Arc is that my pre-knowledge of the characters from my play-through of DR2 allows me to enjoy it a tiny bit more. However, this is also a reason why I find it boring since I've already been over these characters once before, and it doesn't seem too keen on adding more to them. I will probably never watch more than the first episode of this series.\\n\\n\r\nI think that this show's most damning sin, though, is how cheap it all feels. I could chalk this up to any aspect that I have criticized so far, but for the perfect example, you need look no further than the ending of each episode. They're ALL cliffhangers in one way or the other. Oh no! What if Asahina is dead?! I don't actually care because she's been given zero meaningful scenes so far, but oh the humanity!!! You probably get the point, but I still believe the worst offender of this is the faked death of Kirigiri, who is the most beloved character in DR (for some reason). She was so fucking worthless before then that I was applauding at how much they made me not care at the prospect of her dying. I'm actually not bashing cliffhangers as a concept necessarily (though I do dislike them) because I can understand the need to occasionally incite some hype on the part of the audience, and I don't really watch shows weekly, so I don't care as much. But is DR3 that desperate for views? I'd even say that including cliffhangers at the frequency that this show does is downright detrimental to its quality. It makes the pacing feel really off, since the inclusion of these cliffhangers is at the expense of entire episodes being total snooze fests. It almost seems like the writers were forcing themselves to construct episodes like this, and this could either be because the content they had to work with is legitimately not that interesting or because they were under a preconceived notion that Danganronpa was ONLY about characters dying, and they wanted to play it up as much as possible. Could also be both, or neither. Needless to say, it's annoying. It's funny because all of this is practically an emulation of those excellent episodes of Humanity has Declined (sup Seiji), but instead of becoming self-aware of their wrongdoings like the great characters in that show, the DR3 writers charge ahead without any shred of guilt regarding the manipulation of their own audience. Despicable, and definitely not an example to be followed. \\n\\n\r\nBy the way, I have been filled in on some of what happens in Despair Arc, so I can confirm that the way the stories intertwine is horribly done and (surprisingly) makes me hate it more. Hurray for hand-waving the entire plot with the most ridiculously boring plot device imaginable!  \\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nREVIEW TL;DR: Incredibly weak presentation on all fronts, fails at being visually interesting, has dull and idiotic dialogue, lack of attention to detail (especially in the setting), stupid plot devices that make little sense, unrelentingly boring, poorly done characters that fail at being engaging, mystery falls flat no matter if you watch this series alone or with its companion show, lacks thematic depth, plot holes that contradict the series' lore, overall disappointment in every major plot point, and has so many more details that annoy me to no end. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, what a disappointment. Actually, to be honest, I had low expectations to begin with. Especially when given a 12 episode run time, it's plain to see that the Danganronpa formula has no merit when converted into animated format. They could've gone in many different directions to compensate for this (such as not making it another killing game maybe??), but instead they only opted to do something VERY slightly different while simultaneous stripping the DR formula of its necessary parts, and failed spectacularly as a result. \\n\\n\r\nIs it possible that I've just gotten tired of Danganronpa over the years? Maybe this is true. After all, the games suffer from a few of the problems I've listed in this review and have their fair share of other annoyances. This anime certainly didn't help, with it essentially shitting all over both of the games' stories. I've also grown quite tired of the \"death game\" format of story, as most of the common plot elements in it bore me to tears now. \\n\\n\r\nEven still, I fondly remember playing Danganronpa on the Vita the day it came out. It was the same for its sequel, too. I remember absolutely loving these games and obsessing over them with my friends. Over time, after playing better games and watching better anime, my enthusiasm towards the series died down. When DR3 was announced, I thought maybe my interest in the series could be re-invigorated. I'm not one to get \"hyped\" for anything new, but I was ready to hop on board and have a great time. Yeah, I can be optimistic. I would've even been somewhat forgiving if the show was fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nBut it wasn't. Did I possibly miss the sign hanging overhead that read \"Fun and wacky times ahead, haha!\" before walking through the doorway? Could I possibly hate fun? \\n\\n\r\nObviously, no. You would be hard-pressed to find someone out there that doesn't love fun, and I would have been having it while watching this show if not for the fact that I don't believe that sign ever existed. I'm not someone that requires all shows to appeal to my higher senses in order for me to like them. Nevertheless, I would prefer my story-driven anime such as this to be BOTH super enjoyable to watch and to make me think about it, but I can still respect the sensation of pure fun that can be elicited out of shows I would never consider putting among my favorites (Little Witch Academia is a perfect example of this). DR3 just sucks at fun. It was a chore to watch, and I honestly salvaged no enjoyment whatsoever out of anything in it. If, while watching a show, I zone out the events that are happening to think about my favorite shows, and I have to rewind because of it, then there might be a problem somewhere. Sorry, but I don't enjoy \"turning my brain off\" while watching a show.\\n\\n\r\nI also want to make it clear that I have never thought about why a show bothered me with such painstaking detail before. To be honest, I don't even like writing these kinds of long-form reviews because there's usually an opinion out there that echoes my own (this review was enjoyable to write, though). And, typically, I drop a show when I feel that I won't like it anyway, so I haven't had many opportunities to do this.\\n\\n\r\nCall me overly pessimistic for despising this show so much to give it a 1/10 (a rating I have only given to 4 other shows and always hesitate to use), but I still seriously believe Danganronpa did not deserve this. It did not deserve to get so thoroughly embarrassed by this god-awful excuse of an anime. It has no merits whatsoever, as a standalone anime or a conclusion to the series. It's not nice to look at, it has a bland soundtrack, it's unsatisfying, it's boring, it's annoying, it's stupid. \\n\\n\r\nI wish it didn't exist. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n....is what I would say, if I cared enough.",

            "content": "If I had to describe Danganronpa 3 in one word, it would be \"unnecessary\". That's ultimately what it all boils down to. DR3 is not a necessary part of Danganronpa canon, nor is it necessary to watch it. It's completely disposable, and altogether just pretty terrible.\r\nIt's pretty hard to write an in-depth review of DR3 Future without going into heavy spoiler territory, since exactly where the story goes is a big part of why it's so disappointing, but I'll try my best. Future sets itself up as another killing game, although this time it's more akin to something found in Zero Escape than Danganronpa proper.It remains a murder mystery, albeit one very different to those found in DR1 and 2. The mystery's solution ends up not only being lame, but also massively predictable. The big reveal towards the end was a total non-event since I'd already figured it out several episodes ago. The mastermind behind the incident is also a letdown, since it was so extensively telegraphed that it seemed almost too obvious to be true. The methods used, the characters involved, the narrative weaved between both this and DR3 Despair... everything is weak.\\n\\n\r\nBut it's not the destination, right? If the journey is enjoyable, then the answers we get at the end don't make and break the whole series, right? Sure, but DR3 Future's journey isn't enjoyable in the slightest. Most of the episodes feel like filler, with pointless characters acting out pointless subplots that don't go anywhere, and they end up pointlessly getting killed. They could've easily told this story in half the number of episodes with how completely unnecessary most of them are. Aside from a select few, most of the characters also only exist to get killed. Not to further the plot at all, but simply just because people will expect a lot of deaths from this series. Both new and returning characters are largely one-note, with only Kyosuke Munakata and Juzo Sakakura showing any kind of depth. None of these other people, including the DR1 survivors, are interesting at all. Even Kirigiri, one of DR1's driving forces, is reduced to a glorified extra.\\n\\n\r\nProduction value-wise, the animation is slightly better than DR3 Despair's, though not by much. The music and voice acting however are, as always, top notch.\\n\\n\r\nWas DR3 Future a completely miserable experience, though? Sorta, but not quite. The most fun I had was discussing theories and just how stupid the show kept getting every week, and if you can't have that experience then I say skip DR3 entirely. Skip if if you've played the games, absolutely skip it if you haven't played the games, just skip it. It's a waste of time.",

            "content": "With the end of Danganronpa 2, fans couldn\u2019t help but be a tad bit disappointed with its conclusion as it didn\u2019t wrap all the problems present in the franchise. And situations were left unsolved and we needed to know more about the \u201cFuture Foundation\u201d. With the third Danganronpa being confirmed to be part of a new universe, the despair for the fans only continued. But with the announcement of a anime sequel to the second Danganronpa game, fans regained all hope for a proper conclusion for this universe, which will leave us satisfying. Whether or not Danganronpa 3 manages to succeed in doing so willonly be decided once Kibou-hen airs, but for now, Mirai-hen is a satisfying continuation of the Danganronpa series; one that feels home with the franchise despite its differences with the previous entries. \\n\\n\r\n~{Story}~\\n\r\nDo note that this is called Danganronpa 3 for a reason. It\u2019s meant to be watched after playing the first and second game (though you can watch the anime adaptation of the first game instead of playing it). But not doing so will make you not be aware of many plot points that are important in Danganronpa 3. Anyways, Mirai-hen continues off right from where the second game ended. Our protagonist from the first game who is now a member of the Future Foundation, Naegi Makoto, is held under suspicion for treason due to him saving the Remnants of Despair instead of killing them. Just when his punishment was being decided, Monokuma appear\u2026 again, and he announced a killing game\u2026 again. Now the members of the Future Foundation are trapped in their own headquarters, forced to play what is supposed to be the final killing game. The premise is basically similar to the previous games, but the main goal of the series is to find the traitor within the group. Overall, the story is handled well and there\u2019s some really big twist and turns along the way. Characters that you thought had plot armor may not. But most of the series is just basically watching the \u201cNumber of People Alive\u201d counter decreasing one by one. There isn\u2019t a proper conclusion in this series, since that is left for Kibou-hen. And some of the revelations near the end can seem a little messy. So all we can do now is hope that the final episode is just as good as the rest of the franchise. \\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Presentation}~\\n\r\nThere\u2019s one thing you\u2019ll notice from Mirai-hen, and that is how different it is from the first two games. First of all, gone is all the class trials from this killing game. This is more like \u201cBattle Royale\u201d where people have to be killed off one-by-one and the culprit won\u2019t be judged. That also means that you won\u2019t be hearing \u201csore wa chigau yo\u201d a lot in the series. Instead of six different cases to handle, now the characters have one large case: Who is the mastermind? If anything, Mirai-hen feels a lot like Zero Escape, which isn\u2019t a bad thing. Secondly, characters now have bracelets with NG codes on them. Each player has an NG code that gives them a restriction. If the restriction is crossed, the bracelet will inject them with lethal chemicals that will kill them. This gives the viewers a sense of mystery as you won\u2019t be able to know what are the characters\u2019 NG codes. But it\u2019s fun to guess and see if you\u2019re right! Thirdly, there are characters outside the game that get focus and you get to know what\u2019s going on outside the game, something which you weren\u2019t aware of in the previous games. Fourthly, humor is very rare in Mirai-hen as things are more darker here. This new tone for the series works well, especially since this is supposed to be the conclusion of this universe. Lastly, and most importantly, red blood is used instead of Danganronpa\u2019s trademark pink blood. Unlike Zetsubou-hen, which sticks with the pink blood, Mirai-hen decided to take a darker and more mature approach to the series, and it works really well. Overall, this is a quite different take on Danganronpa, but it\u2019s still really fun and feels like a proper sequel for the series. \\n\r\nPresentation: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Character}~\\n\r\nMirai-hen mainly focuses on the Future Foundation characters, which consists of most of the survivng characters from the first Danganronpa game, and new characters we get introduced in this series. The protagonist from Mirai-hen is the same as the first game, Naegi Makoto, a survivor of the first killing game, a member of the Future Foundation, and commonly known as the Ultimate Hope. The series focuses on Naegi and how he has to find out who the mastermind of the killing game is, while making sure that him and his friends survive. Accompanied by him is Asahina and Kirigiri from the first game, and many other new characters like Miratai and Munakata. A lot of the new characters are developed using Zetsubou-hen, and it works pretty well. And that\u2019s why both Mirai-hen and Zetsubou-hen should be watched together. Not all the new characters are likable, but that was the point. But many of the new characters do end up being really well done. Yukizome does play a big enough role in Mirai-hen, but her development from Zetsubou-hen carries on here. Munakata might seem a little irritating at first, but he ended up being one of my favorite characters from Danganronpa. Same goes for Sakakura too. Overall, the new characters end up living up to the Danganronpa name and the recurring characters are just as likable as they were in the first game\u2026 except Hagakure, \u2018cause no one likes Hagakure! What? Monokuma said so!\\n\r\nCharacter: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Art}~, \\n\r\nAs mentioned in my review for Zetsubou-hen, the art style in that series had a more vivid look to it than the games. Mirai-hen is the complete opposite as it has a darker art style that the first two games. This might have been done because Mirai-hen itself has a darker tone compared to the rest of the franchise. Or the art style is like that to represent Mirai-hen being a story that begins with despair, contrary to how Zetsubou-hen begins with hope. But this art style works well with this series. Most of the series takes place inside the headquarters, so most of the backgrounds will be the inside of buildings. But the backgrounds are pretty well detailed and well done. And the character design for the new characters are really good and well done. The characters from the first game also look more mature due to their age growth and their new designs look great as well.\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Animation}~\\n\r\nThe animations are fairly good in the series, but it isn\u2019t anything extraordinary. However, that is to say that the animation quality is fairly consistent throughout. Generally speaking, the animation is fluid enough and there aren\u2019t any noticeable animation quality drops. Character animations are done fairly well. Lighting is very differently that Zetsubou-hen. Everything looks bleaker and the lighting add to that. However, the animation quality is better than Zetsubou-hen\u2019s but that should be necessary since Mirai-hen is more action-heavy than Zetsubou-hen. As mentioned before Lerche did a good job in animating two seasons during the same time, which they aren\u2019t used too. \\n\r\nAnimation: 8/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Voice Acting}~\\n\r\nThe seiyuu cast is really good in Mirai-hen as most seiyuu return back to do their recurring character, and the seiyuu for the new characters are great too. One notable change is that Tarako is now the new voice of Monokuma instead of Ooyama Nobuyo. The reason so is because Ooyama is currently suffering from dementia, which is very sad to hear and hopefully she gets well soon (even if things don\u2019t look good). Though Tarako isn\u2019t as good as Ooyama, she does a decent job as Monokuma, though the character is barely here in Mirai-hen for an obvious reason. Ogata Megumi does a great job again as Naegi and makes him feel very similar to the first game. Hikasa Yoko does a great job with Kirigiri and Saito Chiwa does a good job with Asahina. We also get some pretty well-known people to voice act the new characters, like live-action actor Hongo Kanata as Mitarai, Morikawa Toshiyuki as Munakata, Suwabe Junichi as Sakakura, and many more. And they all do a great job in what they have to do.\\n\r\nVoice Acting: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Music}~\\n\r\nOne of Danganronpa\u2019s strong point is its music and Mirai-hen is no different. The OP, \u201cDEAD OR LIE\u201d, is really good and it grew on me really fast. The vocals are good, but the music for that song is awesome. The lyrics not only matches the series, but the franchise as a whole. It might very well be one of my favorite OP of the year. The ED, \u201cRecall THE END\u201d, creates more of a mystery vibe and it matches well with the series. The ED gets really good near the middle, once the second verse happens. Most of the background music consists of music used in the first two games, which is a good thing since the two games had some amazing music. The background music creates a sense of nostalgia due to its familiarity. Many of the OST that you\u2019ve heard during trials or investigations are used in Mirai-hen, and it works really well. \\n\r\nMusic: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Enjoyment}~\\n\r\nAs a Danganronpa fan, I found Mirai-hen to be a very satisfying continuation of the series and I can\u2019t wait to see how Kibou-hen wraps things up. Seeing the surviving characters of the first Danganronpa game was fun to see and the new characters in Mirai-hen are really interesting and unique. This new take on the killing game with its Zero Escape-ish style is great and it\u2019s new, darker tone works. A lot of unpredictable things happen and it keeps me more and more invested in the series. Every time an episode ended, I would spend the rest of my time waiting for the next episode, while theorizing who can be the mastermind with the given clues I have. Despite it being an anime and not a game, I still feel like I\u2019m using clues to solve this one big case, and that\u2019s what I wanted as a Danganronpa fan. \\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Mirai-hen is a proper continuation from the ending of the second Danganronpa game. If you are a fan of the series, you should definitely check Mirai-hen out if you haven\u2019t already. There\u2019s a lot of things that are different in Mirai-hen when compared to the rest of the series and it has a style of its own. But it still feels part of the Danganronpa series, even with these changes. Seeing the Danganronpa 1 characters again was fun and the new characters are nice too. The plot-twists and revelations work well and keep me invested in the series. Mirai-hen doesn\u2019t have a proper conclusion, but that is because Kibou-hen is supposed to be the conclusion for this Danganronpa universe. Hopefully the Mirai-hen arc will get rid of all the despair left in the series.\\n\\n\r\n+ A proper continuation of the Danganronpa series.\\n\r\n+ Killing game is unique and its new style and tone works well for the series.\\n\r\n+ The first game characters are back and most of the new characters are really well handled. \\n\r\n+ Interesting cat-and-mouse story that has a good amount of plot-twist and revelations.\\n\r\n+ Soundtrack from the first two games are used and they are effective and OP/ED are great. \\n\r\n- Revelations near the end raises a lot of questions.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.9/10",

            "content": "Note: Before watching this please play through all three Danganronpa games (1, SDR2, and Another episode). Also you should watch the future arc episode with the despair arc in broadcast order. Watch future arc ep 1 then despair arc ep 1, and so forth and so on. Watching the two series in this order is very important as Despair arc develops some of the characters from the Future arc.\r\nDanganronpa 3: Future arc is a sequel and essentially a finale to the Danganronpa series. Whereas the counterpart Despair arc is a prequel to the entire story, Future arc details the story after the Biggest, Most Awful,Most Tragic event in human history. It reintroduces the killing game shown in the DR series prior, except this time, in the real world, without any school rules. There are completely fresh batch of characters, some whom we eventually see fall.\\n\\n\r\nFuture arc centers around the main survivors of the events in DR1, along with the division leaders of the Future Foundation. The leaders themeselves had thought that they already caught the traitor, but little did they know they had already fallen into the real traitor's trap. To make the matters worse, this time the killings don't end in a class trial as it did in previous games. Instead, they have to find the traitor and kill him to end it once and for all. \\n\r\nThe story is basically kill or be killed. Unlike Despair arc which starts off with a more light hearted tone that constantly evolves into a more brooding tone, Future arc starts off with a darker tone straight of the bat. The first couple of seconds of ep 1 essentially shows how the world has become since the Biggest, Most Awful, Most Tragic event in human history. And throughout, the episodes are just constantly filled with tension as the characters try to somehow find a way to survive.\\n\r\nFuture arc also manages to weave in characters from all three Danganronpa series. Whether it is a whole episode dedicated to them or if it's just a couple of moments, it is still fun to watch the rest of the other game's cast after their events.\\n\r\nA problem with this kind of a setting though is the pacing, which was noticeable in Future arc. One episode could be filled with new events while the next could be slightly disappointing and rushed. However, the still lingering mysteries about the traitor and the NG codes (the only \"rules\" in the killing game) kept me hooked throughout. One huge disappointment was the plot twists regarding the DR 1 characters. At first I thought, \"this is really happening,\" but then after a couple of episodes and even in the Hope arc, the plot twist got ruined by playing it safe. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is great and the action scenes are fun to watch. The art itself was also a good point from Future arc. Like the tone, the color schemes of Future arc constantly stays on the darker color, unlike Despair arc which slowly transitions from lighter to darker. Also to emphasize the impact of the killing game, the staff even decided to change the blood from pink to red. At first, I didn't know how to feel about this as the pink blood was a unique part of the danganronpa series, but it was understandable considering this was the finale and they had to really highlight the brutality of the final killing game.\\n\r\nOne interesting aspect, like I mentioned, is that Despair arc events has great meaning in the Future arc. Knowing what happens in Despair arc comes in handy for the Future arc.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening song is great and the soundtracks are decent. However, being a guy who really pays attention to the OSTs, the ones in Future arc were slightly underwhelming. There is also an awesome cast of new voice actors who did great, alongside the voices we were already accustomed to.\\n\\n\r\nObviously, the most important part of Danganronpa series are its characters. When I was going through each DR series for the first time, I always wondered if I would get attached to the characters. The same was for the Future arc. Unfortunately, It's safe to say I like some of the characters, but not more than I wanted to. Maybe because the anime was just a 12 episode series and not an entire Visual novel, but it was harder for me to get attached to the characters. Some of them died too quickly, granted it was to showcase the brutality of the killing game but still. Some of them started out just plain annoying, although one certain character did get more fleshed out than the most.  In the latter episodes, a lot more characters get fleshed out a bit more, which was nice to see. . We got backgrounds and more personalities: whether interesting or annoying. However, it was still minimal, so I honestly did not care for most of them. One of the characters got more depth than most of any other characters in other DR series even. Anyways, although the new characters do show interesting traits and personalities, it was rather hard to get attached to most of them quickly. It was only after a couple more episodes that I got somewhat attached to more characters.\\n\r\nAfter 11 episodes, I have to say that the developments of some characters are pretty awesome to see. For example (SPOILER: Juzo), was one character I thought I would never like, but in the end he became the most developed and also became my favorite from the new cast. \\n\r\nAs for the original DR1 cast, they were pretty much the same. Kyouko being the smart detective trying to find out the traitor, Hagakure being Hagakure, and Naegi being that typical \"not let anyone die\" MC. One thing I liked from the original cast was Asahina, whom you could clearly see matured and developed after the killing game in DR1.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough their are clear flaws in both pacing and early characterization wise, Future arc still is a pretty decent watch. As with the DR games, it is always so stressful for the new episode to come out because you don't know who might die. The mystery of the traitor is not obvious and make you think of all the possibilities. One of the biggest downsides, however, is the underwhelming ending.  Character wise, although it startes out in a weak manner, gets better as episodes progress, though it is heavily limited. Although both Despair arc and Future arc are disappointing in many aspects, both are still a decent watch for dangaronpa fans.",

            "content": "Third time's the charm.\r\nHere it is, a third killing game. Monokuma managed to pull it off for the third time now, this time with 12 new characters in the killing game along with Naegi, Kirigiri and Hina. I was a little skeptic about this part after episode 3 but I'm glad it delivered near the end, as Danganronpa always does. This entry will launch off with a brand new killing game and it will be the (near) conclusion to the entire Danganronpa franchise of the Hopes Peak Academy era. We await the conclusion with Side:Hope.\r\nIf you're interested in watching this, you have to go backto the start of this series as this is the third entry from this series and watching this without knowledge of prior entries will confuse you and you wont get the full enjoyment out of this entry, not to mention it will also spoil the events of SDR1 and 2. If you have knowledge then the watch order would be episode 1 of Side:Future, then episode 1 of Side:Despair and continue that pattern with the finale being Side:Hope. Remember, this review will contain minor and major spoilers of SDR1 and 2 and also very minor spoilers of SDR3, you have been warned.\\n\\n\r\nThe story starts off almost right after the events of SDR2, Naegi's \"betrayal\" by siding with the Remnants of Despair. Que all the leading members of the Future Foundation along with some of the cast of SDR1 and boom, you have your brand new killing game, quite exciting isn't it? Here there is a new concept called NG codes - With NG codes, every participant has an action they can't do and the bangles are stuck on their wrists, if they end up doing said action then they get infected with poison, a neat concept for Danganronpa and it spices up this killing game. Also, every 2 hours they get infected with sleeping gas, then the traitor/killer wakes up and kills someone, if the traitor/killer kills someone then the game goes on, if no one dies then everyone wins the game. There is no class trials in this one. It's a rather slow start, but it later picks up and it gets very interesting, overall I thought it was a well written story, with plot twists, cliffhangers leaving you wanting more and overall nice direction, unfortunately we were left not with a conclusion yet as there will be one more episode in Side:Hope, therefore the last episode doesn't feel as satisfactory as it could have been.\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\\n\r\nStory - 9\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nAh, the characters, do they live up to the amazing casts of SDR1 and SDR2? No, unfortunately they don't, but wait, that doesn't mean they were bad at all. There were 12 brand new characters introduced to us, all of them were former Hopes Peak Academy students or staff. Two of the characters weren't really developed at all and felt very flat. Other two characters didn't feel interesting enough even though they were developed, they even got lots of screen time in the beginning so I was thoroughly disappointed in the begin. I'm glad they did get development though, otherwise it would've been bad. All the other 8 characters were fair game and I really enjoyed seeing the Vice-President in this anime, a great character to come out of this one. Thanks to Side:Despair we got to learn more about most of these characters too, which was nice.\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nThe art, just like Side:Despair, wasn't anything amazing. They did a few animation faults too, like covering what was supposed to be a hallway with a wall, constant changes in the characters positions after they wake up from the sleeping gas compared to how they were when they fell asleep. It wasn't necessarily bad, but I found it quite disappointing, but I guess it's understandable with how much work the animators are probably doing at the same time - Side:Future, Side:Despair and SDRV3 - still doesn't excuse it though.\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\\n\r\nArt & Animation: 6\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nNaturally, the sound is amazing. With new voice actors, they all did wonderful. Danganronpa never fails to amaze me when it comes to selecting the voice actors. The soundtrack is really good too. I have no issues with the sound at all.\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nExcept for the rather boring start, this was a blast to me, I really enjoyed seeing the returning characters again and I loved the direction of the story, A great sequel to SDR2 I might say, hopefully the conclusion to the series wont be bad, that would just be fairly disappointing after all the fun I've had with both sides.\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nWhile this show does have a few faults, I still think it was really good, a great anime that I recommend to any fan of the Danganronpa franchise, it's a must watch and I'll remember this one for a while just like the previous entries in this franchise.\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------",

            "content": "Danganronpa 3 for me is a very risky move for me especially due to the fact that it's a 12 episode anime and we know how that turned out to be last time. I reviewed Danganronpa 3 Despair arc and as I said it is a really broken anime.However, Future arc was really well constructed and was much better than despair arc, but it's still not the best thing i could have imagined. Im pretty sure hope arc will wrap things in a great way, otherwise This whole show would go to waste. So let's take a closer look about the anime that follows theevents of the NWP.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nThis anime no longer adapts the bright and energetic colors from the past entries. They decided to go really dark with this anime, even the blood is red now. I have to say that is a very daring decision to tamper with an art style that was iconic for danganronpa but honestly...I LOVED THIS CHANGE. It really works, you see mirai hen is supposed to be a concluding anime and it must have a really strong vibe in it that makes feel as if this anime is the beginning of the end, and thats how the new art style helped in this anime. The gory looked really disturbing and I loved that. It gives a more eerie vibe to the situation. Ofcourse the anime has the same issue as despair hen where i feel the character design lack details in some scenes,however in this anime it's very small. I wont say the art here is perfect but it definitely was amazing, really great great decision to go more darker\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nAs I mentioned before in the despair arc review, both animes of Danganronpa 3 recycle some old tracks with some new additions. While Despair arc felt lazy in its approach, future arc really did it right. There is simply not a single soundtrack in this anime that didn't make me feel uneasy. It's perfect, and the new additions in future arc were really great. I enjoyed both the recycled tracks and the new ones, not to mention both the op and the ed were MAGNIFICENT!!! Great job on the soundtrack, really eerie, mysterious, and really has the finale vibe in it\\n\\n\r\nStory 7/10\\n\r\nOK the story was good, but not a danganronpa level good. I felt like they have held back a little bit in this anime in terms of twist just to focus more on the theme of hope. the story is reeeeeeeaaallly slow paced here, but they use the same danganronpa formula here in which they give a slow story while throwing some cliffhangers and interesting plot points here and there to keep you moving until the end. I was kind of disappointed to see how certain twists in the story were not that shocking in this anime. I felt like this moments could've worked better if it was a video game, because the execution of these twist felt very how do you say relaxed rather than tense. I think that it is kind of hard for them to pull of a strong twist in anime because it's not the same as doing it in a video game. It was a shame also that story had to rely on despair arc to reveal some of the new character's past. Well the idea itself is not bad actually. The problem is this idea made despair so broken and incoherent because they had to fit a lot of stuff there that damaged the quality of despair arc. There is also a certain death scene in the anime that I was confused how it really lacked some impact on it, again you can tell that they struggled here in showing strong plot points here because of the restrictions of making a 12 episode anime. I did feel sad for that death but the execution of that death scene itself felt very relaxed and not dramatic enough. There is also an episode that pissed me the hell of in this anime where they dedicated an entire episode to showing the aftermath of ultra despair girls. Now I didn't play that game but ive seen walkthroughs and I know the story and honestly I did not like it. The episode was veery boring and did not add ANYTHING interesting to the story except for a bummer and a potential spoiler, hell I dont even expect those who liked ultra despair girls to appreciate that episode. It killed the pace. Now The best thing about the story of mirai hen is how they tackled the the themes of hope. Honestly, it was perfectly executed. I won't talk in details here to avoid              spoilers, but the way tackled hope in this anime was more mature and much better than the past entries. Also, every moment with new characters especially munakata was really great, except for juzo. Overall the story is good with really strong approach to its themes but lacking a little bit in twists.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10\\n\r\nMirai hen did FANTASTIC job with developing it's characters especially the new ones. Well don't expect much of development from the original cast but I gotta tell you: you will LOVE the new characters. Munakata, Chisa, Sakakura, Tengan, Mitarai, and Kizakura were definitely Great!!! Munakata was my favorite. His Ideals, his idea of hope, his determination, his past and how it changed all together made Munakata a really enthralling character. Not to mention the relationship between the trio Munakata, Sakakura, and Chisa was very deep and well constructed. Ofcourse most of this development was aided by the despair arc which is really good except that as i mentioned before it puts a lot of burden on despair arc. I think to conclude my thoughts about Tengan and Ryota, I have to watch Hope arc first and thats why i am not gonna talk about them here. Overall, the anime did great in its delivery on presenting its character except for the main danganronpa which was a bummer but understandable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10\\n\r\nFrom the first episode of this anime, The tension and expectations never dries away. The plot for me was disappointing at times and then at other times it just captures me again. two things kind of killed my enjoyment here. First of all, the excess of action scenes here. It was okay at the beginning, it makes you feel the tension but later on...I think the anime changed to BlazBlue. The action scenes were really bothersome to watch, yeah the animation was descent but  this is not danganronpa anymore. you see these action scenes start to kill all the mysterious vibes and thrills of the anime, it feels really childish, they should have focused more on making a good mystery adventure rather than stupid and annoying action scenes. the other thing that annoyed is that ultra despair girls episode.....YES ITS THAT ANNOYING. Around the end of the anime, everything becomes just right, just the way you wanted it to be and the way it should have been from the beginning, continuous mystery solving and character tension without overuse of actions is what this anime should have done. As a whole, the anime is really entertaining and keeps you guessing while annoying you with stupid action scenes here and there\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\r\nYes Mirai hen wasn't disappointing at all.It is a really good anime, but you can see that spike chunsoft didn't do their best here, I think they should,ve just focused on making a game even if they don't want the same killing game to be repeated a third time. Im just guessing they didn't know how to do it with a game and so they decided to make an anime. The final piece remaining is the hope arc which will determine for sure whether this anime is a masterpiece or a failed conclusion. I put my trust in spike chunsoft",

I recommend you read through a synopsis of the other parts of the series or you may be confused on some of the things they mention. You should watch Zetsobou-hen alongside it for some background info.)\r\nI like Dangan Ronpa 3 because it wrapped everything up into a nice present.\r\nI like Dangan Ronpa 3 because it is split up into two parts (soon three) to not condense any info.\r\nIf you have been really into the series, you will be satisfied to know a lotof things are covered especially regarding Chiaki and the Remnants of Despair. You also get to see Junko Enoshima behind the scenes as she works her plan to bring the world into despair!\\n\r\n-------------------\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: The story is great. As I said, it wraps everything up and makes everything clear. If you watched it as it broadcasts, you hungered for new episodes as the cliffhangers were appropriately placed. Of course, a lot of people will be dying and a character you may not expect. A certain cliff hanger in episode 11 is unexpected, but it's never anything I was expecting.\\n\\n\r\nART: The art is very good. The art is not the best, but it's not the worse I have seen (ex. Asako Get You!). The shading is really nice. They have improved certain animation aspects such as gore (mostly in Zetsobou-hen).\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: The sound is outstanding. I rate sound by how memorable it was. There are some reuse of songs from the game, but they are remastered(?). The opening to Zetsobou-hen is my favorite versus this OP, it's calm despite what would later happen..\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: The character design is good. I don't really like many of the new characters, but they aren't bad or bland.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: I really, really, really, enjoyed this installment. It's sad to see it end (?) and I cannot wait for the finale. I am really hyped and you will be to even if you simply started watching right now.\\n\\n\r\nThat's all. Don't give in to DESPAIR!\\n\\n",

            "content": "Tldr, bad writing, unlikable characters, and animation errors make this a truely unenjoyable experience from start to finish, with EXTRA bad parts thrown in for good measure.\r\nI've played every Danganronpa game, and read every story and relevant side plot.\r\nStarting from the first moments of this anime you'll notice a surprising lack of budget. The art is barely passable for a series of this size, the sound direction is forgettable at best, and the writing is awful. The character's are where danganronpa has always shined, but don't expect them to save the story this time. They are completely unlikable, and have no real set motivations orgoals. The only time you'll learn anything new, interesting, or plot relevant about a character is in flashbacks seconds before they die.\\n\\n\r\nSkipping the art and sound, which are both merely low budget, we'll talk about the writing and story. As mentioned, the new characters have no real set motivations or personalities. They exist merely to bump heads with characters you know from DR1, and have no lives beyond that. You never get the feeling one of these characters will be missed by someone, you never get the feeling that they were someones loved one or partner, these characters ONLY exist in the vacuum of this anime plot to chase Naegi and Aoi around for 20 minutes an episode.  This may lead you to believe that Naegi and Aoi are central figures to the plot, that they are relevantly unraveling the mysteries and being developed as characters. You'd be wrong though. They have nearly no plot relevance, they are only there along with the rest of the living Dr1 cast to pretend to die at the end of episodes so viewers will watch the next episode. It never sticks though, and some of the fakeouts get pretty insulting by the end of it. Episode seven in particular is just filler, and can be completely skipped. Episode 9 is when the anime really hits it's lowest points however. Everything after episode 9 will leave you scratching your head, wondering why this anime was made in the first place. The anime ends where it starts, a status quo were nearly nothing new has been introduced to the DR canon, and the UTMOST \"Care\" was taken to make sure that NOTHING about the old characters has changed in any way.\\n\\n\r\nOn pure enjoyment factor alone, I'd recommend fans of the games, and fans of anime in any form to avoid this series. Scenes will drive you crazy with constant continuity errors, animation errors, and forgotten plot threads.  The premise is stupid, and is never justified. Unlikable characters are made up on the spot just to die. Deathflags are so obvious that you'll never be surprised or caught off guard. Characters walk on screen and announce their time to die, then die, and none of the other characters really seem to care. Several times characters are found dead, or murdered directly in front of everyone, and nobody bats an eye or cares.  Ends on Status Quo restoration,  the entire anime can be removed without losing anything from the series. \\n\\n\r\nI'll finish this review on a somewhat positive note. The characters Ruruka and Seiko have their own subplot that spans for almost the entire series filling up whatever time isn't taken by Naegi and Aoi doing basically nothing. The sub plot has some obvious flaws but is interesting and keeps the episodes moving, and these two characters actually end up being developed because of it, you may accidentally end up even caring for them.  However just as their character arcs come to a close the story reminds you how stupid you were for liking any of the new characters. Then replaces them with even more Aoi and naegi, just running around and not really accomplishing anything.\\n",

            "content": "It's been three years since I looked at the first Danganronpa anime. While it wasn't one of the best anime I've seen, I did rather like it. Now we're skipping ahead to Danganronpa 3, because there wasn't a Danganronpa 2 anime. Maybe  they thought the game wouldn't translate well. Maybe they didn't consider it good enough. Maybe they got distracted reading Voyages of the Cerberus and missed their window of opportunity. The first two are more likely by far but a man can daydream. The odd thing about Danganronpa 3 is that it's split into two settings, both of which were running at roughlythe same time. This week, we'll be looking at the Mirai-hen & Kibou-hen setting this week. Although I may take a look at the Zetsubou-hen setting later this month. So, let's take a look and see how it holds up compared to the first series. \\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nWe open with our protagonist from the first series, Naegi Makoto, being taken to the headquarters of the Future Foundation to answer charges of being a traitor. Supposedly, he safeguarded a bunch of remnants of despair. Maybe that's what happened in the second game. While attending the meeting with all the foundation's higher ups, along with Kirigiri  & Asahina, the building gets attacked. They wake up to a Monokuma video telling them that they've been brought into a game of despair. He claims that one of them is a traitor and, in order to end the game, they have to either kill the traitor or wake up with all of them alive. To put them to sleep at regular intervals, they're also given wristbands that inject them with sleeping drugs after a set amount of time. The wristbands are also programmed with forbidden actions. Should any of them do their forbidden action, they'll be injected with a lethal amount of poison. Naturally, Naegi is instantly viewed as the most suspicious by several people. Can he survive their attacks and solve the mystery around him?\\n\\n\r\nThere are two major flaws with the series. The first is that it spends a lot of time following the characters who are outside of the game. A lot of the stuff they do is really over the top action fare and it hugely undermines any suspense or horror atmosphere that's happening on the inside. Not only that, but the events on the outside don't do that much. They reveal some information that the audience could have gotten from the characters on the inside and it would have worked better. The other big problem with the series are the speeches. In the first Danganronpa anime, the ending had a big speech and it was cheesy and kind of stupid, but it didn't hurt the series over-much since the bulk of it focused on the mysteries, which were pretty solid. In this series, there are a lot of really cheesy speeches about hope and despair. A lot of the discussion is less about the mystery and more about hope. These are speeches that could kind of work, if they were in a Precure series or something else for small children, but that are really absurd and ridiculous in this context. By the way, the Kibou-hen special is mostly cheesy speeches to wrap everything up and the series retconning what could have been a strong tragic moment thereby ruining it.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, this was a solid premise. The idea of all these characters being trapped in a claustrophobic setting and uncertain of who they can trust is a compelling one. If they'd focused more on that facet and less on over the top action and speeches, this series could have been really good. I also do like the ultimate reveal. The twist is also genuinely clever. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nIn the first series, the characters were largely kind of shallow archetypes, but passable for what the series was doing. In this one, not so much. While the characters are still shallow, they're also a bit annoying. Particularly Naegi and Munakata with their long speeches. We get it, you guys have a serious hope fetish, leave it in the bedroom. The only character who gets to keep their dignity is Kirigiri. She's the only character who actually seems interested in solving the mystery. The rest spend their time chasing after each other, hiding, or following her lead. \\n\\n\r\nOn the outside, we have our action squad, Naegi's sister & Touko from the first series doing the bulk of it. We also have Tagami who gives some exposition and orders people around. We also get to see Hagakure hang about outside the Future Foundation building being completely ineffectual. I seriously have no idea why he's here. He contributes nothing to the story. They just cut to him doing random things on occasion. In one scene he's fortune telling. In another he's fishing and, in another he's fleeing a helicopter. None of which affects the plot in the slightest. You could seriously replace him with a black Labrador and nothing would change. Except that the Labrador wouldn't be as annoying and would be cute. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nI've mentioned the overblown action scenes already. They aren't good. The absurd, overblown character designs continue to be a weakness for the series. I'm sorry, but it's distracting when your horror mystery has characters who look like they should be challenging children to a trading card game in order to steal Egyptian artefacts. The unique, game aesthetic the first game had with its visual style aren't present in this one. Which is kind of a shame since those did give the series a unique identity. Which is something this one could use. We've got dark visuals mixed with goofy character designs. Neither of which is really unique. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nHikasa Yoko is really good in this. I'll also give credit to Ogata Megumi, in spite of Naegi's annoying qualities, she does give a strong performance as him. Saito Chiwa and Ishida Akira are also quite good. As are Suwabe Junichi & Morikawa Toshiyuki. Most of these performances, in all fairness, are perfectly passable. There are a few exceptions. Minase Inori doesn't do well when her character gets in any kind of emotional moment. Neither does Eguchi Takuya. I don't know if it's the direction or just that they aren't good at serious moments. I've heard them both give strong performances in comedic works, but never in anything serious. Hirano Aya's character is just an annoyance. \\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nThere's a  bit. Naegi's sister and Touko seem to get really close in their scenes together. Which culminates in a really homo-erotic speech from the sister while they're clinging to a rocket. Although, it does seem to be one-sided with all indications being that Touko still has a thing for Tagami. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nThis was a series with a promising premise. Unfortunately, it's held back by a lacklustre execution that largely fails to take advantage of it. Instead, we're given cheesy hope speeches, ridiculous action scenes and characters who mostly can't be bothered with the mystery. In the end, it's a weak follow up. My final rating is going to be a 4/10. Next week I'll continue horror anime month with a look at 91 Days.",

            "content": "It's hard to objectively look at the series you invested hours and hours into.\r\nThis anime will not be for everyone. Even if you decide to play through all the visual novels and a spin-off game (which is rather crucial to the story as well), there is a chance you'll find it \"unnecessary\", \"poor\" or just horrible and not deserving to be part of the series. I got a lot more out of the anime than I was originally expected, being told by everyone, how bad this show is. If you played through all the games, I dont see a reason why you wouldn't atleast trythis. I will keep this review as spoiler-free as I can. \\n\\n\r\nI'll start with praising the Opening, as it really deserved it. Visuals are beautiful, it doesn't shove any important plot points into your face, and, of course, the song itself is amazing.\\n\\n\r\nThis is only half of the show, and I recommend alternating between Future Arc and Despair arc episode by episode (starting with future) as that will save some interesting surprises for both serieses. You should also alternate between this review and one on Despair arc. Which is an obvious joke and you shouldn't bother, but the idea of having to watch two shows at the same time is rather interesting and works surprisingly well for this one. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the most apparent reasons to watch this anime is for the characters, and this one really delivers. Some characters weren't fully explored, due to the nature of the killing game, some are more fleshed out in the despair arc, some get maybe a bit too much screentime, but the original gang is back and it was really nice to see them again. New characters were really hit or miss, and I wish some of them survived for longer, but thats part of the fun I guess. I dont think this would work as any game, same as the original visual novel didn't work as anime, this story is not \"Danganronpa 3, but the anime for some reason\", it is a way to tie all loose ends which in theory works much better than a VN would. If it suceeds in practice, is another question. There are many pretty obvious plot holes in this story, some things happen just because, it isn't clear how some stuff works, characters sometimes act irrationally, some long awaited questions aren't satisfying enough or not given at all, etc. But you shouldn't expect any serious realism from this anime. Original VN had many silly moments as well. Many plot holes can be explained if you think about the situation the characters have to face and overall pressure on them (and also the ridiculous setting of the series of actual superhumans existing here, wiping out armies with ease). I dont think it makes the anime much worse, but some moments did sting a little, esspecially near the end. Danganronpa always had some problems with satisfying and logical endings, and this one is not really an exception. The overall plot is really a 7 because of it, it isn't horrible, and it has some good moments, but I dont think it is on par with the games. And despite that, there were enough moments to keep me invested in it, making it hard to wait through an episode of Despair arc to find out what happens next here (which, honestly, was the case for Despair arc too, and was the weirdest thing I've experienced while watching an anime).\\n\\n\r\nDid I mention that art is pretty good yet? The colour scheme and shots convey the atmosphere very well, action scenes, while not being super detailed, are well animated and it is clear that a lot of work went into them. There is some repetition in shots, but there aren't too many to get in your eyes. Overall, Lerche did a really good job with this one. I expected to be always disturbed by the blood not being trademark pink, as it was in VNs, but it surprisingly fitted more to the story it was trying to tell. \\n\\n\r\nI suppose what matters the most, is if it does well as the continuation and partly conclusion of the series. And I think that the answer is yes. It doesn't ruin any already established characters or concepts, it evolves them, it really feels like those characters indeed have suffered through a lot of despair, esspecially the characters from the first game. It is worthy to be in the series, as I see it. \\n\\n\r\nI really loved playing through the games, and I loved watching this anime, no matter how silly it was at times. If compared to Despair arc, I'd say that this one is worse of a final product, but thats mostly because I enjoyed the second game so much. If you just want more danganronpa, this is for you, there is not much more like this, in both anime or videogames. It isn't flawless, but it really isn't as bad as some say. I give this show a subjective 9 and an objective 7, which rounds up to an 8, cus I make the rules here. Now, go watch it if you haven't already and let the game begin!\\n\\n\r\nAlso, ED is good, but I skipped it maybe a bit too much.",

            "content": "LA is gonna change up the format for this review as well as Zetsubou-hen by making it a sorta of 3-parter due to the nature of how Danganronpa 3's animes were presented so if you wanted to see LA's take on Zetsubou-hen and Kibou-hen then this review won't be in it.\r\nBefore LA talks about Zetsubou-hen, LA will say that both Mirai-hen and Zetsubou-hen anime are something of a companion piece with each other giving off clues or events that transpired that lead it to how or when it happened. The obvious companion piece both these anime have is \"trying to find the traitor\" and whysome of the founders are butting heads with each other in Mirai-hen and \"how Danganronpa's franchise started\" as well as some backstory on some of the newer characters in Mirai-hen for Zetsubou-hen and both arcs gives and feeds information to each other. For anime-episode order, you should/MUST watch by starting with Mirai-hen's episode then Zetsubou-hen episode then back and forth after that for \"clarity\". Once both Mirai-hen and Zetsubou-hen have finished finishing with Mirai-hen's final episode go to Kibou-hen for the finale\\n\\n\r\nWith that out of the way\\n\\n\r\nMirai-hen's \"ultimate death game\" by in large vastly different from the the original series' one, where there are NO trials, as well as forbidden actions you'll not allowed to do in the death game otherwise you'll die instantly and having the find the traitor within the Future Foundation, before the traitor picks hope out one by one, if not the Future Foundation are already going after each other already due to the previous backstories and lingering grudges that the newer characters has. (See Zetsubou-hen review). This as a precedent makes the game far more complicated and all the more bloody with clash of beliefs of the same thing, just differing ways in which the Future Foundation members especially Kyousuke Munakata voiced by Toshiyuki Morikawa.\\n\\n\r\nDue to the nature of the death game, it's expected that some of the Future Foundation members' screentime is rather limited from the Great Gozu voiced by Kenta Miyake and Daisaku Bandai voiced by Rie Kugimiya being more obvious ones, the only exception to this is Chisa Yukizome voiced by Mai Nakahara as her backstory goes full circle in Zetsubou-hen. Aside the from that, many of the other Future Foundation members do get some form of development such as the quarreling between Ruruka Andou voiced by Inori Minase and Seiko Kimura voiced by Saki Fujita with Sounosuke Izayoi voiced by Takuya Eguchi in the crossfire of it as well as Kazuo Tengan voiced by Hidekatsu Shibata the chairman of the Future Foundation believing in Makoto. With that, the rest of the Future Foundation (omitting the characters from the original like Kyouko and Aoi) all have their backstory in Zetsubou-hen. If there was much to say about the focus of the character development, it squarely likes to focus on the more immediate (as well as important least developed) characters and \"dispose\" of them once their done, just hopefully you've got invested in right characters before their untimely deaths because Mirai-hen does not care who dies here...very much like the death game itself. BUT just because character die doesn't mean that's it as sure they might have their time in Zetsubou-hen (maybe), BUT...this is Danganronpa after all...really what LA is trying to say is, even in this death game even beware of those who are already dead.\\n\\n\r\nFor what this ultimate death game gave LA, was a sense of paranoia to the point LA was both analyzing and being paranoia as to who's gonna die next as well as finding out who the \"pawn\" (if there even is one!), \"traitor\" (who's killing the future Foundation members) and \"mastermind\" (Junko died TWICE right...so who's controlling this Monokuma?) are in this complicated personal grudges and hope vs. hope death game and Mirai-hen is chock to the brim with red herring deaths or unexpected ones...it keeps you on your toes to the point your being suspicious of characters who might already be dead, yes even LA was suspicious of even the dead characters especially of Chisa considering she has a bigger role in Zetsubou-hen. If there was something that Mirai-hen did right was to bring in the atmosphere of despair and paranoia. Despair from the unexpected deaths, paranoia from who's gonna die next and speculating who the mastermind, traitor and pawn are.\\n\\n\r\nWhich will also bring up the unexpected plot twists concerning the ultimate death game, from the characters who will die PERMANENTLY to who the mastermind, traitor and pawns are and this is where the paranoia and despair ramps up the tension even further ohh and add in the expected unexpected red herrings and this death game has no mercy on their characters and none our your speculations. Another words...the plot twists are both amazing, confusing and paranoid-levels of \"HOW IN THE HELL WHY!??!?!?!\" \\n\\n\r\nOhh right...favourite character?...LA had two. Chisa Yukizome and Kyouko Kirigiri.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation done once again by Lerche like from the original series, Lerche brought out the dull gray tones depicting rather bleak tones right for the death game and guess what those pink blood are GONE in Mirai-hen showing red blood this time, so it's telling their serious for this one. The color palette aside from the colorful cast are green and red tinge to gray and black backgrounds (this is considering the setting is in a massive tower...the color palette is acceptable). The action scenes were pretty decent overall going from decent tactical battles to wholesale crazy ones. Where the animation kind of went down was that it for the most part has more \"talking than battles\"...ironic since it is a death game, but the atmosphere and mood of the anime was a helpful disguise to mask it and really did it quite well so LA won't criticize it too much because of it.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of voice acting, well we got an exceptional list of voice actors here and listing them would take soo long, overall LA would just say that the voice acting was top notch with some special mention to Aya Hirano as Monaka Touwa, Toshiyuki Morikawa as Munakata and probably the best playing against the type role of Saki Fujita as the mad chemist Seiko. Ohh right LA forgot about the change up in voice actors for Monokuma, due to Nobuyo Ooyama's dementia, they had gotten Tarako for Mirai-hen and really...Tarako did an ok job as Monokuma, LA couldn't say much about Monokuma considering that Monokuma HARDLY appears in Mirai-hen, nonetheless Tarako was \"ok\" for the most part as Monokuma. If LA had to really pick best voice actor in Mirai-hen...it goes to Toshiyuki Morikawa...without a doubt.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending if anything brought about a rather anti-climax, but will be hopefully taken up by Kibou-hen. But for Mirai-hen's ending, yes the \"mastermind\" was found out as well as the \"traitor\" and \"pawns\" in this death game, in terms of themes, it's kinda ironic how it leads, pitting despair and hope together, where throughout the anime despair formed into hope, but by the end, it seems that hope will morph into despair, there is ALWAYS despair and hope, one can't live without the other and eliminating either of them will cause unintentional or intentional chaos. If anything even when LA found out who the culprit was and a meta-textual Junko and Chisa outright how the events of Mirai-hen occurred to make all this happen...LA IS STILL SKEPTICAL that \"that's it\", it's not like Danganronpa to outright tell us information like this soo easily without hiding some red herrings to double dupe us. Well if this ending IS TRUE really LA calls it an anti-climax because LA thinks that the TRUE finale is in the finale of finale's Kibou-hen, this ending is just a taste of what's to come. LA is SOO HOPEFUL right now.\\n\\n\r\nMirai-hen being the finale of the entire series of Danganronpa does what it's meant to do, pit hope against hope to see which one will go on to the future and watching both Mirai-hen and Zetsubou-hen in conjunction with one another just made the mystery of the traitor, character development of the newer characters, not only was the 2 animes of Danganronpa within the same season something rather uniquely done and presented, but executed quite well and quite honestly seeing Danganronpa's final chapters was something both to praise about and weep for as it's finally ending in the most bloody ways possible with it bringing in near impossible murder mysteries and homicidal robot bears and zany and eccentric characters. LA was thankful that not only were there gonna be 2 animes of Danganronpa but that even Mirai-hen on it's own satisfying LA's craving for more Danganronpa and Mirai-hen took that expectations and easily exceeded LA's expectation for it (even with that rather anti-climax of an ending)...and even more once Hope arc arrives for the finale to end all finale's!!!",

            "content": "So, Danganronpa 3: The End of Kibougamine Gakuen - Mirai-hen ends, what used to be a game, ends, so what can I say about this sequel??????????\r\nStorywise, I gave it an outstanding 10 over 10, since the genre really did played out, as indicated, the plot was basically a hope vs despair theme as the first \"Danganronpa: Kibou no Gakuen to Zetsubou no Koukousei The Animation\" ( don't include the prequel pls). And just like the frist sequel the story also played us audience as well, where one might think that the anime was more of a repeat of the first sequel , but was not........itreally almost fooled us, kudos to the creator:  Spike Chunsoft, whoever he or she is. FU, FU, FU, FU!\\n\\n\r\nArt, well I don't have much to say about it since the only thing that have change was the character's attire, I'm referring to Kirigiri, Aoi and Negai, the rest......well, except for Munakata, Tenga, Juzo and  Chisa, who all wore the appropriate  attires, were just too damned silly, and I can never understand as what up with Seiko wearing a dorky surgical mask, Miaya, being in a wheelchair, even thought she's an android, and,Gozu with that bull mask. However I'm giving a 6 over 10 for Komaru's fanservice, FU, FU, FU, FUUUU!!!!\\n\\n\r\nSound, it's a 5 over 10, since the seiyuu's who did the character's voice were still the same.....for the major character's that is. FU, FU, FU, FUUUU!!!!!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter, ok, this is the part were a mensa member would wanna give the original creator  Spike Chunsoft and director Kishi, Seiji a lotta lambasting for insulting talented people for using the term \"super level\", in fact they would see that the character's represent the kind of foolishness of not being able to tell apart as to what is , talent, virtue, slot, vanity, oddity and the  bizarre, so let's group them:\\n\\n\r\nNegai Makoto and Junko Enoshima: one is a specified as a Super High School Level Luck/ hope and the other is  Super High School Level Fashion Girl/ despair/ psychopath weren't to be consider as such since their other title despair and hope are virtues not talent, also Junko is a loca, so she should be having the title super level psychopath. Negai, being this super level luck. should just be consider as \"The Protagonist\" without any of the super level bullshit.\\n\\n\r\n Bandai, Daisaku and Yasuhiro Hagakure, whatever super level bullshit they are, are just a bunch of super level dorksters with no function at all........I can't say the same in the videogames, since I don't have such luxury of having it.\\n\\n\r\nMunakata Kyouske and Juzo Sakakura, were nothing more than a bunch of super level bullies, whom themselves were against the others and eventually begun being against with each other.\\n\\n\r\nKizakura, Kouichi and Tenga Kazu, were just a couple of old geezers, that were meant for retirement....to their grave.\\n\\n\r\nIzayoi Sonosuke and Andou Ruruka, one is a treacherous manipulative bitch and the other is a protective ass, who is just as stupid for allowing himself to be killed by his manipulative bitch. \\n\\n\r\nYukizome, Chisa, MItarai and Seiko Kimura , I meant, really, these guys are super level at something one is a super level pharmacist and the other is a super level Housekeeper? Can it get more odd than this , since both of them were super level suckers? And that's what they are. Seiko Kimura would ask as to where did her friendship with Andou went wrong? Well, it went wrong the moment she met her, dang stupid character. Yukizone as aSuper Level House keeper???????Man, I can do the same jobs as she does, and really, a mensa member has all the right to criticize the creator, Spike Chunsoft . Mitarai....is pretty much a super level pussy.\\n\\n\r\nAnd lest's not forget Komaru and Toko, can be considers as the ultimate lesbian lovers. The rest like  Kirigiri, Aoi, Gekokgahara and Monaca and Gozu, were the protagonist's support, I also give this category a low score since they killed off Kirigiri instead of the ultimate bimbo Aoi. Kirigiri has more substance than Aoi, so why should she be killed off , that is the question. And I hate that she's being killed off. So the character assignment was just soo poor and it's a 3 over 10, FU, FU, FU! Btw, nice to see Togami again.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, well it was a good 7 over 10, since it was enjoyable, but not that good cu'z why???????????Oh yeah , cu'z they killed off Kirigiri and this anime was left with an open ending for the other sequel...the hope arc that is.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall it's a fair 6, on to the hope arc.......\\n\\n\\n\r\nFu, Fu, Fu........\\n\\n",

            "content": "I'm going to kind of melt in Future and Despair side, as they are intended to be watched at the same time, but I'm mostly directing my attention to Future.\r\nI used to be a big Danganronpa fan. I got the VITA for the sole purpose of playing the games, when SDR2 was only getting translated by some random people on the internet and the first game had just gotten localized. I've spent a lot of my time on Danganronpa, analyzing it, doing fanarts, discussing theories with other people, reading the fan-translated novels, playing Ultra Despair Girls, and although it had some flaws, I really theDanganronpa series overall.\\n\\n\r\nBut when I knew that they announced an anime, I just had this bad feeling. Danganronpa: The Animation wasn't really good, as the quantity of episodes was just not enough for the hole plot and it tried to fit like 20+ hours of gameplay in 13 episodes of approximately 25 minutes. 20+ of gameplay, details, plot, characters, into less than 6 hours approximately of an animation. And obviously, the adaptation wasn't really the best. But I thought, \"Hey, they won't make the same mistake twice. Besides, two arcs? That's a total of 24 episodes, so maybe it will be different!\"\\n\\n\r\nOh, how wrong I was.\\n\\n\r\nBoth despair and future side just tried to throw in a bowl and mix a lot of characters, random plot ideas, deaths with no meaning, and terrible death flags that screamed \"hey lol i'm gonna die now\". One of the major things about Danganronpa that I liked was how ridiculous, yet interesting the plot twists were. Even if you expected some of them, it was interesting to see how the dots connected, the contradictions, the solutions, and the characters going through that trip to the truth. And sometimes the twist would make you go \"holy shit\", because you didn't really get to see them coming.\\n\\n\r\nDanganronpa 3 didn't include any of those. Instead, the supposedly \"plot twists\" were so predictable, they basically screamed to your face \"enjoy this characters because we are going to kill it\". All the raising of death flags was painful to see, it felt like watching a Blue's Clues episode of how obvious everything was. A lot of cheap and mediocre tactics to get the ratings up, including unnecessary weird fanservice (although I kind of can let that pass because almost all animes do that), fake deaths of loved characters to keep the \"cliffhanger up\", and most of the \"cliffhangesr\" were basically thrown out to hell next episodes as they killed the hype.\\n\\n\r\nThe new cast was basically introduced to just fill the background. There was almost no major development except for a few things, but most of them were just to basically boost up the stage for survivors of DR1, specially Naegi, who doesn't really change a lot and gets very repetitive. And there was almost no development on characters, mostly just good designs but empty shells. They just tried to throw plot ideas that ended up contradicting the canon stuff, forgot about some of the novels, and a lot of other pointless stuff. And the ending was literally out of Danganronpa's character. No bittersweet, no guilt, no sadness to see. Only a rainbow colored happy world, contradicting so much stuff, done for only fanservice and to end the \"kibougamine arc\" (which will be probably be brought back again anyways, as there's even an OVA coming with the new game).\\n\\n\r\nThe anime just killed the essence of Danganronpa itself. No surprises, no cliffhangers, no plot twists, no character development. Just a terrible ripoff of Dora the Explorer with murder and some crappy hope vs despair plot.",

            "content": "(WARNING! THE ENTIRETY OF DANGANRONPA 3 WILL BE REVIEWED! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED)\r\nHard to believe that a Visual Novel would have this level of success, isn\u2019t it?\r\nNow, Visual Novels getting anime adaptations isn\u2019t anything new. Ace Attorney had one, Fate/Stay Night had a bunch of them, Steins; Gates\u2026 you get the point, really. What is definitely unique, however, is that the ending of a grand, overarching storyline that has been going on for years, from multiple forms of media such as Visual Novels, Light Novels or even traditional videogames, would have its finale in an anime-original storyline. That, my friends, is Danganronpa 3: THE ENDOF Kib\u014dgamine Gakuen.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is unique in its structure. When it was released, it was technically two shows at once, Mirai-Hen (Future Chapter) and Zetsubou-Hen (Despair Chapter), with you needing to watch a Mirai-Hen episode and then its Zetsubou-Hen counterpart. Once both shows are done with, a Special appropriately called Kibou-Hen (Hope Chapter). It\u2019s definitely unique to say the least. But, does that make it a good show? Well, that\u2019s what we\u2019re about to find out\u2026\\n\\n\r\n\u2026 But before we do, I need to explain something. As some of you might have seen in my previous reviews, I have a tendency to review multiple seasons of a show at once, or in some cases, entire series of movies. However, other times I have given the other season its own review. This is mostly because, when writing these reviews, I ask myself one question: \u201cWhat can I add by making a second review?\u201d. Unless the shift in quality between seasons is too noticeable, or there is enough material to talk about in the latter season (Or movies) that is open for discussion, I will only do one review. I just wanted to get that out of the way. Anyhow, let the final killing game begin:\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nSet sometime after the events of Super Danganronpa 2, the show serves as the grand finale to the plot that\u2019s been going on since the first game. That said, this anime has two goals, and this is where the genius of having two separate shows comes in. Its first goal was to finish the story of the survivors of the DR1 Killing Game. We got some of that in SDR2, but only Naegi, Togami and Kirigiri actually appeared in it. As such, Mirai-Hen is about them (And also Hagakure, Asahina, Fukawa and Naegi\u2019s little sister Komaru) facing their final challenge as they try to uncover what the hell is going on and just who the hell is the true mastermind.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the other goal this show had is to explain just what the hell happened that led up to the events of the first game to begin with. Again, we got some of that in SDR2, but only the basics. That\u2019s Zetsubou-Hen\u2019s goal.\\n\\n\r\nBoth succeed at this greatly, through different means. Mirai-Hen has a constant feeling of pressure. Everyone wants Naegi dead, and they\u2019re gonna do whatever they can to have him dead. It all makes for an unconformable and tension filled atmosphere. Zetsubou-Hen also has this, but that one manages to do that through paranoia. We know for a fact that things will go to hell, but the question is: How? And more importantly, when?\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s not to say it\u2019s perfect, though. Zetsubou-Hen in particular has some\u2026 questionable twists and a rather blatant case of Deus Ex Machina involving Komaeda (That doesn\u2019t involve bagels). On the other hand, Mirai-Hen has some equally dumb twists, most of them revolving around the new mastermind.\\n\\n\r\nNow, you might have noticed that I haven\u2019t mentioned Kibou-Hen at any point. And if you see my Anime List, you will also notice that it has a lower score than the other two chapters. That\u2019s mostly because the ending is honestly a bit of an anticlimax, with the DR1 cast getting barely anything to do in it. That said, I did ultimately like it, because it fits with the themes of rising up from despair seen thought the series, and it\u2019s also nice to have some well-deserved happiness for the cast. So overall, DR3 isn\u2019t perfect, but it\u2019s still great.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe cast is huge, as you would expect. The SDR2 cast doesn\u2019t get much development (Aside from Hinata and Nanami) but I do appreciate their inclusion here and I do think this is a fitting end to their stories. No, the real meat of this cast is the returning DR1 and UDG characters alongside a few of the newcomers. Naegi in particular goes through a lot in this anime. His own pacifistic nature bites him on his ass constantly, yet it still ultimately shows why his admittedly na\u00efve idealism is one of the few things that\u2019s allowed him to stay sane.\\n\\n\r\nHe also gains a pretty good rival in the form of Munakata Kyosuke. This guy is effectively Kyosuke Nanbu, but with the grumpiness somehow taken up to eleven (They\u2019re even voiced by the same guy). He\u2019s cynical, extremist, grumpy, yet at the same time, you can\u2019t help but feel sympathy for him given all of the crap that happens to him. I think my favorite of the new characters, however, ended up being Sakakura Juzo, Munakata\u2019s right hand man and best friend. Like Munakata, he\u2019s a dick of epic proportions. Yet at the same time, his hatred for Naegi is ultimately justified, and there\u2019s a twist involving him that I won\u2019t even dare spoil due to how utterly ridiculous yet genius it is.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast is also pretty good, but I don\u2019t have much else to talk about, really. So let\u2019s move on to\u2026\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\\n\r\nThe show looks pretty good all things considered. Mind you, this isn\u2019t some kind of fighting centred show that needs stellar animation, but it does look pretty good. I love the way that they made both Chapters distinct from each other. Zetsubou-Hen is more or less a standard translation of the VN\u2019s art-style to an anime, with all of the color and censored blood you\u2019d expect. On the other hand, Mirai-Hen\u2019s colors are more visually saturated, with the gray filter greatly helping with that. Hell, the blood isn\u2019t even censored anymore. Overall, the show looks pretty decent.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nOnce again, Takada Masafumi graces us with his glorious soundtrack. I don\u2019t even know what to say, really. The few returning songs are glorious, and the same goes for the new ones. As for the Openings and Endings, I love them. Both \u201cDEAD OR LIE\u201d and \u201cRecall THE END\u201d do a great job setting up Mirai-Hen\u2019s dark atmosphere, whereas \u201cKami-Iro Awase\u201d and \u201cZettai Kibou Birthday\u201d do a better job setting up Zetsubou-Hen\u2019s more immediately uplifting yet mysterious tone, even if the lyrics of the latter make absolutely no sense, even from the point of view that those are Komaeda\u2019s thoughts.\\n\\n\r\nVoice Acting:\\n\\n\r\nThe whole cast of the previous outings bar one come back and do an outstanding job as always. Ogata Megumi and Takayama Minami both do an outstanding job, with them having the additional task of having to play two characters each, yet making them sound so distinct from each other. Morikawa Toshiyuki and Suwabe Junichi also do an excellent job as Munakata and Sakakura. And of course there\u2019s Toyoguchi Megumi delivering her usual brand of crazy as Enoshima. And that\u2019s not even mentioning everyone else, from Hisaka Yoko, Ishida Akira, Miyake Kenta, Hanazawa Kana, Matsukaze Masaya, Sawashiro Miyuki and so many more.\\n\\n\r\nNow, remember that I mentioned one actor didn\u2019t come back? Well, sadly it had to be Monokuma\u2019s Actress, Ouyama Nobuyo. She was diagnosed with dementia some time before the anime came out and had to step down from the role as a result. Thankfully, they got former Zero Escape Alumni Takaro to take over the role, and while she may not be as good as Ouyama, she more than delivers in the essential areas.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nSo yes, I loved this show. It wasn\u2019t perfect, but I don\u2019t think it needs to be. It may not be as good as SDR2 or especially New Danganronpa V3 (My all-time favorite Visual Novel), but those are some pretty high standards. This show did what it was suposeed to, and did so marvelously. I highly recommend watching this show\u2026 just make sure to play everything else except V3 before you do so, or you\u2019re gonna have spoilers shoved up your ass.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score for Danganronpa 3 as a whole: 9/10",

Well, you can go forward from the first Danganronpa anime, that's ok, but if you wanna enjoy the 2 arcs of this last story it's recommended at least, Super Danganronpa 2 to be played.\r\nAnother recommendation if you gonna start the anime, it's see a chapter of this arc and 1 of the despair one, and repeat the process for better understanding.\r\nLet's start, we got to the point to at last see a end of the situations involving hope and despair with its roots at Kibougamine Gakuen painting an end... This anime gonna start at theend of Super Danganronpa 2 (They gonna fill you up in some details needed in this story, if you don't play the game) with our very proud and powerful lucky student, Naegi Makoto being putting in scene in a new mutual killing game with less time and more ferocious Ultimate Students, former ones, the Future Foundation itself, and the usual, but maybe less powerful Monokuma.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, the characters, as always, very rare talents attached to very rare people again, they are cool in a sense, but well, they gonna end dead at the very end, but belive me, they all are ultimates, so they are special, you don't gonna be bored with their actions.\\n\\n\r\nSecond, the story, this maybe could get very tedious, because, after hear hope, hope, hope, hope, in a game, and an anime before, you think it's enough, but this is the end, so, bear it again, please... the flow, it's more like a premises of the future with the need of a connection of the past to still keep forward (Zetsubou-hen), even so, the flow of the characters, the situations, the revelations that get connections at this very point to get an end, that is the real flavor of this story, its very meaning, a very cool one, because the new mystery of the killings it's easy but you are here for answers, of course.\\n\\n\r\nAnd third, the music and CG, have very much connection with the first story, so you gonna still hear the usual BGMs and sounds, with the Psycho Pop style of Danganronpa with more elegance and technology, well, Psycho-Technology, rare, but that make it great.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end you need this and the despair one, to end this at the Kibou-Hen, so it's a good anime, a good story, necessary to fill us up with its answers altogether with the other arc, maybe we expect something different, but when you reach the end of each arc, you see the meaning and good synergy of this last track of the path.\\n\\n\r\nIf you reach this part of the review, feeling this useful or maybe nothing at all... anyway, thank you so much for your time, and happy anime, may the hope protect you from the despair, pupupupu.",

            "content": "Danganronpa 3 Future has become a mixed bag for fans for the franchise.  Even when it was announced that it would be a anime instead of a game, there were doubts that this could be done well.  What didn't help is that it would only have 12 episodes for this side alone.  After watching it, indeed certain things in the overall narrative didn't quite click well.\r\nBefore watching this, playing DR:  Trigger Happy Havoc, Super DR2: Goodbye Island of Despair and DR Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls is required.  Also, alongside Side Future is DR Side Despair, which viewers are meantto watch side by side.\\n\\n\r\nFirst off, most of the criticisms stem from the format.  This franchise started as a series of games that average at least 20 hours of gameplay.  The conclusion of the series being one 12 episode series, an 11 episode series that ties into it, and a sequel special that will tie up both series and overall would only take up atleast 10 hours brought up some concerns.  With at least 16 characters, even with at least 4 already known, the limited time along with the usual content of the series gave doubts whether the characters would be given a decent amount of screentime and characterization.  Despair side picked up some slack in that regard by relegating time to give further exposition for the new characters, which also opened up problems as well for that series.\\n\\n\r\nIt also didn't help that at the beginning, the new characters come off as unlikable right from the start.  The story starts off after the events of Super Danganronpa 2, in which Makoto Naegi, the protagonist of the first game and taking up the protagonist role again here,  is being tried for his actions in trying to save the Remnants of Despair from being executed by the Future Foundation, and undo the influence Junko Enoshima has done to them.  Now, Makoto, as a member of Future Foundation, it is reasonable for him to be held accountable for his actions that were out of his own sense of morality but were against the organization's as a whole.  What was not is that the heads of Future Foundation holding him on trial weren't being reasonable in the slightest and are outright antagonistic towards him from the start.\\n\\n\r\nIt's reasonable that one or two would make claims that he's a traitor, but it's the opposite in that only a few aren't immediately jumping to conclusions, and the majority already made their decisions about it, hinting that the trial would have been against Makoto from the start, if things didn't go to hell before it properly started.  It's stupid.  The audience knows Makoto was acting on good intentions.  To have the new characters from the start be against him would already make them less receptive.  However even after they get trapped and put into a killing game, many of them still act unreasonable as they automatically assume Makoto is the one responsible for this and start trying to kill him right off the bat.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the actually likeable characters or the ones that didn't automatically come across as jerks from the new cast are the ones that start getting killed off.  It's easy to determine who's going to die because it's always the one that's given focus the same episode.  You, the viewer, start to find this character interesting only for them to be killed off abruptly before the episode's end, leaving the unlikable ones around to create conflict.  This was intended so they could redeem themselves in some way near the end, but it's divided whether the payoff was worth it.  I actually grew to like Munakata even though he was the one mainly responsible for the string of irrational decisions that started most of the conflict in the series.  Sakakura was still a mixed bag for me though he did become a more fleshed out character.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 7 was a episode that could have been better used to focus on other things.  The main story is replaced by a related but separate incident that would have been better left as a \"leave to your imagination\" only getting the critical parts of it.  The plot focuses on the plotline from Ultra Despair Girls and I really liked some of the fanservice in that episode.  Still, from a narrative perspective, it's only slightly related to the main plot.  All it really does is drop a death flag for a DR1 character.  The cost wasn't worth it.  The character that was the main antagonist in that game and was revealed to be participating in the current killing game via robot masquerading as one of the FF branch heads turns out to be red herring, and she gives up right in the middle of the episode.  She literally self-destructs all her robots herself for no reason.  That it was a troll in the end did not sit well, and personally was disappointing for me, since I really like Ultra Despair Girls and didn't like the episode making one big joke out of it.  And precious time that could have been used on something more relevant was instead used for this kind of fake out.\\n\\n\r\nWhat turns out to be critical for Future's plot is certain characters, and if they aren't done well, they will damage the series as a whole.  First is Chisa Yukizome, whose importance is affected by her role in Side Despair, and what happens to her.  She was the teacher of the 77th class that became Super High School Level Despair, and she in turn was brainwashed like them by association.  Once this is revealed in Side Despair, the truth becomes she was still brainwashed in Future arc, and was the reason the vice-chairman had become so irrational by her doing heinous crimes, then showing them to him while hiding the fact she did it, and influencing him to be more extreme in his beliefs.\\n\\n\r\nShe also turns out to be the one to have given this series' mastermind the means to do the killing game. The way this was handled was less well done.  She literally just gives the mastermind the Macguffin without any more context whether or not the situation at the time fit or not, especially when who the mastermind turns out to be.  That moment sums up her fatal flaw, in that she's less of a character but a plot device to railroad the plot when needed or in this case, explain how the mastermind got a certain thing.  It's not even hidden; during one moment in both series, she exclaims because of her talent, she's lead to important moments.  Anything the viewer may have liked about her is gone once she's brainwashed making her role in the story more apparent.\\n\\n\r\nNext is the mastermind, who turns out be a character who died during the events of the series.  This person turns out to be the chairman of Future Foundation, Kazuo Tengan.  And the reasons why he set up this killing game relates to another character, who I will mention next.  His motives turn out to be to get this person to use something he had.  The problem is that the person was also part of the killing game, meaning that person was in danger of dying.  Questions are raised why he didn't guarantee that person's safety.  Why of all things he set up killing game to influence that person to use the Macguffin.  And if that person wasn't supposed to be there originally for the events, then how and why did he end up being there.  It's left to interpretation so far, maybe to be clarified in the special.\\n\\n\r\nLastly is Ryota Mitarai.  He is key to this entire anime, both sides of it, leaving him a very divisive character, and one that really needed to be done right.  His talent is as an animator.  His dream was making an anime to inspire hope in others just as he had been.  It all goes wrong once he turns to using subliminal messaging and other brainwashing techniques in his work and he encounters Junko Enoshima, who twists his work for her purposes, used it to brainwash Chisa and the 77th class to spread despair, and the reserve course students to commit suicide, setting off the end of world.  This leaves him very guilt ridden that carries over to the Future arc.  After these events were presented in Despair arc, he becomes a sympathetic character.  However, this somewhat diminishes after it turns out he made another video to brainwash people to spread hope, what Tengan wanted to push him to use and now after all this, he's now resolved to use it by uploading it to all communication devices.  Even though Tengan was the mastermind, Ryota is now the true final boss.  Not to be resolved in Future arc though, but in the Hope arc.  Yes, the finale of this series ends on a cliffhanger to resolve all the plotlines in a special.\\n\\n\r\nThe fact all the events so far lead up to this is underwhelming.  In the end, it's more brainwashing from the Despair arc, that was divisive from the start.  Also, more importantly, Ryota turns out to not learn anything, and now, he needs to be stopped. What's worse is that from the start of Future arc, he is just there.  No reason exists for him being in this side of the story until this moment.  You'd hope his first major act to be aligned with the protagonist and not against him, making all this build up to be a waste, because Ryota isn't even a true antagonist.  He's just misguided, engulfed by his guilt and weakness, and projecting it onto the world.  Making the final confrontation to be convincing him to not to follow through because it would be a mistake.  That's just disappointing and wasn't worth being the climax of the series.  If it turned out Tengan stole the Hope video, did broadcast the killing game, and set up for the video to be broadcasted afterwards, requiring Ryota to stop it, with previous episodes giving him character development, that would be easier to accept.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I did enjoy this, in fact I enjoyed this more than Despair arc.  I do understand why Spike Chunsoft wanted to end this storyline in an anime.  Makoto and the rest of the DR1 characters shouldn't have been in anymore class trials; they're past that.  Now, would it have been better instead of an anime, Spike Chunsoft make a game with different gameplay elements to compensate that?  Probably, but I'd imagine that would be difficult.  Also despite my criticisms, I'm looking forward to see how it all ends in the Side Hope special.",

I cried alot of times. A lot of people hated the end of Mirai-hen but I found it brilliant because it's a really interesting idea Kodaka got.\\n\\n\r\nArt : 8/10\\n\\n\r\nNothing really exceptional, nothing really bad. The animation is really good. I don't have a lot to say.\\n\\n\r\nSound : 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe OST is really good but thumbs up for the opening and the ending which are for me one of the best (especially the ending). They are really beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 9/10 \\n\\n\r\nEvery characters are interesting, thanks to Zetsubou-hen which takes place in the past, before the start of DR1, you learn a lot about the new characters (Seiko, Ruruka, Izayoi, Munakata, Ryota and some more). You easily understand why they are doing what they are doing and you are really moved when something happens to them. For the DR1 survivors, they are really great and Kyoko got even more character development.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI don't even know how to describe every emotions I got when watching this anime : sadness, happiness, fear, angst...just wow.\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 10/10\\n\\n\r\nA lot of people will disagree but I don't care, for me DR3 is one of the best things I have ever seen in terms of story, sound or characters. A masterpiece.",

Its the perfect blend of action and psychological action. If only it didn't emphasize on hope and despair so much. We get it, Naegi is \"Ultimate Hope\" and so forth, but it just forces those two words around and around and around. It goes from trying to but despair as the overlapping theme to just full out \"despair, \u7d76\u671b. despair, \u7d76\u671b, despair, \u5e0c\u671b, hope , despair, and so on. Itjust made the anime a bit less entertaining. Overall, this anime was one of my top 10 anime of the season,  maybe even number 1. I strongly suggest this anime to a lot of fans out there who are looking for good and action-packed anime.",

Danganronpa 3 is basically the sequel of the first two games, unless you watched/played the games then you'll end up being clueless or lost. \r\nStory:\r\nThe story already explained what happened after the second game, Naegi was punished for saving the remnants of despair. Then we get a new killing game with FF members. Some parts of the story are connected to the other games like Ultra Despair Girls or the second game.\r\nArt:\r\nIt looks decent, but It got darker when they changed the blood color to red. The opening looks really edgy and shows the viewers thatthere will be deaths in the show.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nIt as the appropriate sound effects, like characters getting stabbed or like Chisa's corpse falling down from the chandelier.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe new characters like Juzo or the smiling guy died too early. It would be better if we knew a short background about them, Munakata & boxer guy doesn't make sense and attempts to kill Naegi for freeing the Remnants of Despair. For Ruruka, she doesn't have any redeeming qualities (as much as I want to like her).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI enjoyed the whole anime for a Danganronpa fan, it was a good sequel for the first two games.

It may also be noteworthy that this is the only anime I've ever seen, and it was mostly ruined for me by spoilers anyway, so take my opinion with a grain of salt.\r\nThat said, this anime annoyed me enough to force me to create a MAL account for the sole purpose of letting me get off my chest why I found this thoroughly unenjoyable. I originally picked up watching this anime as a fan of the games. I greatly enjoyed the tense story and engaging mystery of the original games, and wanted to finally see the conclusion ofthe story. So, I watched fair-use-loopholed episodes on YouTube. However, I found it completely unentertaining. The only reason I watched it to completion was to finally bring the series I once enjoyed to a close. I honestly entered into the series with hopeful attitude (excuse the joke), and I genuinely wanted it to be good, but it didn't have any of the same charm that the games did. To get to the heart of my issue with this anime, I'm going to break this down part by part.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nNarrative stakes are nonexistent. First of all, the show gives you no good reason to care about the new characters, and any reason it does give is ham-fisted and cliche. The Ruruka and Seiko spat felt meaningless because the show did it so heavy-handedly, yet it barely qualified as drama to me when most of the dispute centered around candy. Second of all, the story shatters any notion that the characters you DO care about from the original games will ever be in danger by episode 3. If it hadn't already been spoiled for me, I probably would have been intrigued by Aoi's \"death\" and been curious as to where they would go with it. But, I imagine that the creators suddenly thought \"Wait, people might care about this character! Better retcon her back in!\" So, Aoi's fake death ends up feeling like nothing more than a shock value cash-in. I almost laughed when they used the \"ketchup as blood\" excuse. Seriously, I would have preferred a handwave instead of a trite explanation like that. Kirigiri's is even worse, because her return is predictable at that point. If they don't even have the guts to kill off Aoi, of all people, why would we believe for a second that they would actually kill off the character that is ostensibly the most beloved character of the series? Of course, it gets even worse when they undermine all the consequences of DR2 by bringing everyone back that died in that game. All the tension of the original games was based on the idea that anyone could die, especially the characters you like. If they had actually killed the characters they pretended to kill, and didn't render the events of DR2 virtually meaningless, this would have easily made the series at least a 5/10 for me, because there would at least be some tension and reason to see if the characters would make it out alive.\\n\\n\r\nSound and Art\\n\\n\r\nI can't say much on the sound and art departments since I have no basis for comparison. All I can really say in this regard is that it didn't make my eyes and ears bleed, so it is at least acceptable in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nOne of the things that made me like the games was that the characters were interesting enough to be memorable. Trigger Happy Havoc's characters all had memorable quirks and designs, and, while the characters in Danganronpa 2 were a little less memorable, their character design was still unique. My problem could be best summarized by this statement: If you asked me to list the entire cast from both games in 3 minutes, I'd do it with plenty of time to spare. However, all the time in the world wouldn't be enough for me to list half of the names in the cast of DR3 without looking them up. I actually had to look up Seiko and Ruruka's names for this review, because I actually couldn't remember them despite remembering their conflict. I only remembered Yukizome and Munakata's names because the show hammers the characters into your skull as important characters. Yukizome was kind of fun to watch in the other arc, but that is the OTHER arc, so it's pretty much irrelevant here. As for any other characters, the best I would probably be able to come up with is 'bull guy', 'black stereotype farmer', 'wheelchair girl', 'boxer guy', and 'asshole blacksmith'. Kazuo Tengan was interesting at first, but lost all appeal when they essentially portrayed him as an absolute crazy with no concept of consequences. Seriously, the aged leader, who should have been the wise voice of reason in the story, ends up having less wisdom than the former-brainwashed, former-braindead cast of DR2. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the games for them actually having interesting and understandable mysteries. The murders were engaging to put together, and the clues got you thinking about the mystery as you went along the investigation. It always made sense in the end, and, even when the mysteries had their occasional asspulls *cough*celestesrealname*cough*, it wasn't like it completely came out of nowhere. The anime has none of that. If you watched the arcs one at a time like me, there was nothing to suggest what might be happening. The Despair arc did set it up, but it wasn't enough to make it feel like a meaningful plot point. I won't spoil the ending (since I've already spoiled enough), but I could only respond to the reveal with a \"lolwut\". It comes completely out of nowhere, as if the buildup and investigation up to the point fulfilled no point but to drive the plot forward. It didn't give you a chance to piece things together on your own like the games, it just says \"here's what's been happening, deal with it\".\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I guess most of my problem is that it has none of the aspects that made the games good. No tension, no engaging mystery, no memorable characters, nothing. It wasn't even darker than the games in any sense beyond aesthetic, because the horror actually stuck with you in the games. Characters the game had been building up for several acts were dying, and it was clear that anyone could die (with the exception of the main character, but at this point I'm numb to main character plot armor anyways). In the anime, it was clear nobody that anyone cared about was going to die, effectively ending anything resembling tension. The reveal was completely out of left field, with nothing to suggest what was going on. The characters were forgettable, the story was bland, the mystery was terrible, and the retconning of character deaths completely undermined the point of the series. For these reasons, I found DR3 to be a completely lackluster conclusion to an otherwise great story.",

            "content": "So its been a few days since I finished this anime and oh boy it was just a mess. Basically long story short, way to much stuff in it. \r\nThe characters are really eh, like they are just unlikable who cares about them really. I would love to learn more but you can't learn about them all in an anime. Monokuma is never in this, the most likable part of the games/show like come on. The only good characters are the despair guys (cause I have played the second game and freaking love them) and the 6 who survived in the first game and anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt was fine really, its just everything seemed dull and gray not much to look at. Like in the other games and animes you have different areas.\\n\\n\r\nSound was fine it gets better as it goes along. Not half bad honestly. \\n\\n\r\nNow the big one... the story. This one is easy to follow like the other games/anime. 16 people stuck somewhere and are forced to kill each other. This time, its different, its a death match kind of thing and the killer needs to kill everyone before they are found it. Its not a bad concept. But in a 12 episode anime, nope its not good here. Like I said with characters I could care less about half of them or even all of them. I went into it thinking it was gonna be bad or meh, because the third game isnt even out and oh boy do I hate when they skip stuff. I thought the ending would get better, nope it really doesn't. It just leaves a big \"WHAT WAS THAT?!?\" kind of moment. Unlike the other kind of endings that were perfect. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, I honestly that this anime was gonna be meh or bad. Turns out I was right. I have seen way to many people giving it a 10 or 9. I really hope to see other people giving it a lower score because its just to much packed in 12 episodes. Now the other thing is people say you need to watch both animes to understand everything. I really don't care I don't want them to ruin my favorite characters, so I dropped the other anime. If they just made the second game then wait for the third game to come out. It would of been better and it might of made them more money because now its over. Cool so its like now what.We know there will be no third anime of the third game. \\n\\n\r\nSo yeah thats my review, a little rant at the end there but whatever. 4/10 for me. I will be sticking to the games for now on and will be careful with game to anime adaptations.",

            "content": "So to start off, I have not played any of the games/read any of the manga, I have only seen the anime adaptation so this is my view of the anime as a newcomer to Danganronpa.\r\nI will cover some spoilers so you have been warned(although by the time I've seen the anime is already long past the hype and relevance so lol).\r\nI also like to start ratings at 5/10 and either increase or decrease from there.\r\nStory: 2/10\r\nSo I watched the first episode of this after completing the first season of the anime(Danganronpa: Kibou no Gakuen to Zetsubou no Koukousei The Animation) and I was totallylost. I recognized Naegi, Kirigiri, Asahini and the fortune telling guy who's name I don't remember or care about, and that was it. I also starting watching the \"Side: Despair\" arc as soon as I finished the first episode of the Future arc.\\n\\n\r\nI looked up the wiki and did some reading and found out you're supposed to play the second game to bridge the gap, but dang was that unexpected for me. I was then able to understand the BARE BASICS, like Naegi and his surviving classmates joined the \"Future Foundation\" and are all fighting Despair and whatnot, and Naegi is now under accusation of not killing the...Remnants of Despair?? I had no clue what that meant although I did recognize a couple characters(specifically  Nagito Komaeda and Ibuki Mioda from seeing some friends being obsessed with them back in like....2014 and I recognized their designs) which meant nothing as I knew nothing about them.\\n\\n\r\nI found it hard to be interested in much going on until I was far enough in the Despair arc to know who a lot of the characters that were present actually were, and know any of their motives. \\n\\n\r\nI wanted to at least be able to follow along with a reasonable amount of interest, but I found the story to be lacklustre, boring, extremely reliant on you having played the game or you having done your research and I found that a main reason as to why I disliked this so much. \\n\\n\r\nAlso using the same trope as the previous season felt like an obvious gimmick, and felt poorly executed (haha, there also were no \"executions\").\\n\\n\r\nI understand the concept of adaptations and how they differ from the source material but I wanted to be able to watch this entirely on its own, and this did a really poor job.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nExtremely dark colours and what felt like just average animation. I think the choice to make the blood red instead of pink was a poor choice other then making it seem more serious, which the mood was already plenty serious enough with all the characters already neck deep in hidden backstory and \"motives\".\\n\\n\r\nIt seriously annoys me when theres multiple scenes that are so dark that result in me squinting at the screen and being able to make virtually nothing out yet at the same time missing nothing interesting. \\n\\n\r\nNothing memorable about the art, especially with the pink blood gone.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe opening was actually one of the better things about the anime, I liked it, although the visuals felt kind of random to me, and the whole \"Kirigiri and Naegi grasping for each other's hands\" felt super cliche.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending was decent as well, I don't remember much about it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nWithout the Despair arc I would have NO idea who anyone despite the high school survivors were, and so by the time I felt any sort of connection with them and their backstory was explained in the Despair arc (if they had one at all) they were most likely dead or three stages past their previous motive/whatever. \\n\\n\r\nAlso I thought this was set in a relatively \"realistic\" world setting like all humans/no crazy superpowers but a few of the characters (aside from basically everyone being able to live after massive blood loss or injuries that would really HURT like gunshots...or stab wound...or cutting off our hand for goodness sake/stay alive way longer then they should be able to) two in particular bugged me for being so \"super human\". Seiko Kimura, the \"Super Pharmacist\" was able to create and consume crazy drugs, fine, but since when does taking bunch of pills realistically make you into a pretty well invulnerable snake lady?? \\n\\n\r\nIt doesn't. (I can already hear haters jkjk) \\n\\n\r\nAnd lets not forget the god-like sword fighting skills of the vice-leader of Future Foundation's Kyosuke Munakata.\\n\\n\r\nKyosuke, who is able to make a sword for no given reason heat up and slice through a robot and later being able to charge at a group of soldiers all firing at him simultaneously yet not get hit by a single bullet. Sigh. \\n\r\nI honestly thought he would die at that point and it was going to be him sacrificing himself so Naegi could keep going at the climax but that would have been to simple. \\n\\n\r\nJust...I understand how characters can have plot shields and be OP but that felt a bit much. And why did Kyosuke's eye turn all black when he went all crazy?? Must have been angst...I also felt the cop out of his friend the Super Boxer being secretly gay for him to be real cheap, like it wasn't needed but I guess it filled a plot hole for what no one would ever guess it was Junko while also not adding anything other then a gimmick to a character and nothing meaningful...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nWhile I disliked most of what this anime was, I did find it a BIT more enjoyable then I first expected. I was actually interested in them finding out who the killer was for a few episodes  although as soon as the green-haired girl was introduced it felt like a quick lazy answer, and from there the plot twisted a couple more times but it felt forced...and just not interesting by that point. I finished watching this anime just to finish it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nI finished watching this not out of enjoyment or interest, but to say that I finished it. A confusing premise that made little to no sense, characters that felt flat and forced until you got their exposited(and separately explained, in the Despair Arc) backstories to explain their seemingly random motives and a dull appearance, this anime was a waste of time. \\n\\n\r\n(side note, now I'm thinking how one plot twist was how they were in an identical building to the Future Foundation's headquarters but I don't think they ever explained WHERE it was or WHO built it/the reason?? I'm just gonna assume thats another plot hole haha)\\n\\n",

However, Naegi is arrested for allegedly protecting the Remnants of Despair. Things escalate as the organisation is hacked by a familiar person, or rather stuffed bear. Monokuma immediately announces a killing game between Naegi, the survivors who were present at his arrest, and the Future Foundation executives. The difference is that in this killing game, there is no class trial. However, there are a few other interesting twists, only one of which I will talk about.\r\nFuture Arc was my favourite.I loved the concept of NG codes, where each character has a forbidden action and a detector for the action. If it is done, lethal poison will be injected. Also loved how they attempt to find out what some of the others\u2019 NG codes are, in order to protect or exploit them. Watching Naegi and crew attempt to survive Munakata and his ally Sakakura was quite thrilling too. Characters from the DR video game, Ultra Despair Girls, also make an appearance here, which might interest some players of the game. One thing I felt that they should have done was expand more on the characters' background stories, especially that of the Future Foundation executives. But I guess it can't be helped, considering the length of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThis wasn't personally an issue to me, but Monokuma had relatively few lines and appearances in this arc, which might be a bit of a letdown for some fans. Overall, still a great show with a lovely little bag of twists around mid to end. Check it out if the concept of a killing game with forbidden actions and lethal poison piques your interest.",

            "content": "massive massive spoilers\r\nThis completely deviated from my expectations at first because I was expecting it to show how the Future Foundation managed to gradually build up society again (which, btw, im kind of disappointed that the anime didn\u2019t show how. I mean I guess they got armies of troops to try to kill off brainwashed people but if despair was so infectious shouldn\u2019t they have been brainwashed eventually too?). Anyway, back to the show itself, so apparently it\u2019s going to be Killing Game Round 3 with some new some old characters. Great, another whole series of mindblowing mysteries right? But to my disappointment, nope, thiswas very telenova-esque and wanted to abandon the very theme that Danganronpa is so well known for: mystery. Instead of being a murder mystery anime like I really think it should have been (it if aint broke, don\u2019t fix it, right?), it focused on conflicts between Munakata and like, everyone, and the petty fights between Cotton Candy Girl, Yellow Spiky Boy, and Pharmacist Witch (who was apparently able to understand molecular chemistry well beyond the capabilities of our greatest scientists today \u2026at the age of 5\u2026), leaving approximately 5% of the story for the real, potentially exciting (emphasis on potential) mystery. Anyway, I maybe could have tolerated Munakata or even enjoyed his conflicts if he wasn\u2019t just so damn fucked up in the head. Sure, his girlfriend just died which may have quite shaken him up (if he was, he didn\u2019t show it\u2026like at all\u2026), but his irrational ideologies seemed to exist beforehand and only worsened as the anime went on. His goal to eliminate any creature that shows any despair (what is despair anyway? The anime uses it vaguely. Technically if you feel sad are you not in despair? Anyway, I\u2019m assuming by \u201cdespair\u201d the anime means crazy psycho murder-craving Junko clone), which is oppressive and authoritarian. If he was that kind of guy, I can understand his actions and call him rational, but no the anime needed to portray him as a positive, hopeful character that genuinely cared for the future mankind. This severely conflicted with his tyrannical behavior to the point of bizarreness that there was no way I could take Munakata seriously as a character. Going on to his main opponent, Makoto, I was dissatisfied with how the anime made him look like some hero. In the game he was just the average Joe, but this anime deeply exaggerated his \u201cstrength\u201d and \u201chope\u201d. The only phrase I feel appropriate to describe Makoto is na\u00efvely optimistic. And he\u2019s given waaaaay more credit than he deserves. I don\u2019t know about the anime, but in the game it was 99% (if not 100%) Kirigiri who triumphed over Junko, yet Makoto is given pretty much all the credit. Oh and Kirigiri\u2019s death. Like I said before, it was utterly pointless. I genuinely believe that the only reason it was implemented was to shock the audience and make them feel sad. That\u2019s all. But oh no, we can\u2019t keep the audience sad for too long! So instead of killing Kirigiri with the usual technique of watching Tengan\u2019s video, we will make the most asspulling (btw, there is so much more asspulling I can talk about, but I feel this is getting far too long) forbidden action ever and have her die that way! Anyway to cut this short I think you can understand how I feel about future. Massive disappointment.",

            "content": "There is just too much wrong with this half of the show. So much, that I\u2019m going to extensively break everything into pieces.\r\nCharacters:\r\nThis was the part that was in absolute shambles. We\u2019ve got the survivors of class 78, and so we should see more of them. That\u2019s point 1. Second, the only actual strong characters of class 78 were Kirigiri and Byakuya. Kyoko was never once given a major development scene, nor was she ever shown to be the fantastic detective and quick thinker that she is. She was left in the background, with a finger to her chin the whole time. Byakuya, meanwhile, hadfive minutes screentime the whole season, tops.\\n\\n\r\nAll we\u2019re shown is Naegi, who can do nothing but shower everyone with his rays of kindness and hope. He did nothing whatsoever to advance the plot, never once did he change course or affect the story in any way, and yet all we are shown is him.\\n\r\nThe \u2018lead trio\u2019 of DR3 are the only ones worthy of mention, of them, even their potential is thrown askew. At the drop of a hat their personalities change, the grow violent for no reason at all, kill for no reason at all, are convinced for no reason at all. And of course, one chat with Naegi has them suddenly back on the good-guy bandwagon. \\n\\n\r\nAnd I never understood the Chisa-Munakata thing. Okay, they care for each other, but why? Oh, she\u2019s going in for a hug again\u2026 okay, but why- oh, oh, another hug. Maybe he\u2019s annoyed of it? No, no, he\u2019s smiling. So why- oh, another hug, okay, but w- oh kill me now, another hug. By the end of the show, the fruit of their development has been reduced to her simply gushing his name. That does not an attachment to characters make.\\n\\n\r\nThe story:\\n\r\nThe reasoning for the killing game is absolute drivel as well. Without spoiling anything, honestly, everything in the show, the reasoning for it all, is so over-the-top, badly communicated and downright just not possible. The point of danganronpa, at least in the games, is the actual characters. The hadn\u2019t focused on the details leading to the killing games for a reason, in that once we knew the details, they simply wouldn\u2019t add up. All we need to know was that these set of teens are thrown in this position, and now they have to fix it. Very cleanly, you have rid yourself of the impinging loopholes and opened yourself up to plot twists and character developments arising from pure development.\\n\\n\r\nIt is an honest waste of time. Characters die without the viewers feeling a thing. They talk continuously about solving the mystery, but never actually do anything about it. The only one who does (Kirigiri) is simply ignored.\\n\\n\r\nInstead we are distracted with pointless plot developments that end up having no influence on the outcome. Because one person said one thing to someone else, that person kills some other person. Honestly, it\u2019s just a mind-numbing, dizzying, pointless merry-go-round. And some of the plot choices were just downright bad. \\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, the point of Mirai-hen should have been not another killing game (which turned out to be the most useless desperate attempt at keeping an audience involved) but understanding why there is still despair and chaos in the world, and why the Remnants of Despair are claiming to not being involved. Because come on, the only things we as viewers want, especially coming from Zetsubou-hen, is to see the characters of class 77. The potential that held, and the time they could have taken to actually develop characters that way\u2026\\n\\n\r\nThe Art/Sound:\\n\r\nNot much to complain about here. The art was pretty consistent actually. The sound was of course, used from the game, as most visual novel adaptations do, and most tracks are great. Some don\u2019t quite fit, and while that would add the freaky factor in the games, in the anime, it just seems rather misplaced.\\n",

            "content": "!!!SUPER SUPER WARNING!!!\r\nIF YOU PLAN ON WATCHING THIS ANIME (or even reading my review) YOU NEED TO HAVE PLAYED/WATCHED THE FIRST DANGANRONPA GAME/ANIME AND HAVE PLAYED THE SECOND DANGANRONPA GAME. YOU ALSO NEED TO HAVE WATCHED DANGANRONPA 3 DESPAIR ARC.\r\nDanganronpa 3 \u2013 The End of Hope's Peak Academy \u2013 Future Arc (these names man) is the sequel to the second Danganronpa game and connects with what we watched in the Despair Arc season. While I am excited we got to see what happens after the second game, I feel pretty let down with this particular arc.\r\nStory: 3/10\r\nLike with the Despair Arc I found thepacing to be the main fault with this season. Because of the short run time all the events happen so quickly. This may just be because I am used to how the pacing worked in the games but in the anime it does not have the same lasting effect on me. To be perfectly honest though there are a lot more plot issues in the Future Arc than the Despair Arc. The main killer for me is that I just didn't care what was going on in the Future Arc. Yeah there were characters that I loved seeing again from the first game and the Despair Arc but they just didn't do anything interesting in my honest opinion. The killing game that the cast in this season find themselves in just felt so fucking lazy and hacked together. The feeling of despair and desperation from the first and second game is completely absent in this season.\\n\\n\r\nWhat really dragged down the plot though was really easy to see plot twists and an unnecessary death. I'm fine with main characters dying for a reason...but the one who does end up dying did so for an non-existent payoff.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAs with the Despair arc the animation looks really good. In fact it looks about the same with the only noticeable difference being the use of really dark colors. Since this arc takes place in the future/present the despair shows in the background. The first arc happens before the killing events so it makes since why that arc would have more vibrant colors. To make this short, the anime looked pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors did a pretty good job but I really did not dig the music timings. They used the music from the games (which is a good thing) but where and when they decided to put some of the music felt really out of place. It just felt out of place; I don't know how else to comment on it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe returning cast from the first game feel right at place but everyone else did not cut if for me. I was either not presented a reason to care for the other characters or they were just plain not likable. Also it felt like they were there just to pad the season along so that the show could hit the eleven episode mark.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6.1/10\\n\\n\r\nIt wasn't bad but it was far from good. The show failed to grab me like the games and the Despair Arc. If anything this arc felt painfully like a filler arc. The main event that does occur felt completely unnecessary and will have unneeded consequences on the future episodes/games. If you are a fan of the series (which you should be if you are even remotely interested in watching the anime) then I guess you need to watch this but please lower your expectations. After watching the Despair Arc I was so freaking pumped to get into this arc. I was unfortunately let down; I sincerely hope that any future installments of the game/anime help make up for this farce of an arc.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review! If you liked my writing style, would like to see some other reviews, or just want to talk, please stop by my page!\\n\\n\r\nSincerely,\\n\r\nAwesome Drummer",

            "content": "As a fan of Danganronpa 1 and 2 was thrilled to see a continuation to the plot which is not neccessary to play before watching this anime, but does provide more insight into the character`s backstories.  The story was ok overall for this anime in which it does not hold up to the quality of the previous Danganronopa installments, but does serve to have a interesting premise.\r\nThe animation is not something I took notice to in terms of it being excellent, but it was done fairly well.  The art is similar to that of the first Danganronpa game while it was often amore dark setting overall which I thought was alright.  \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime have some great classics returning like Kyouko Kirigiri, Aoi Asuhina, and Makoto, however, the new cast members from the future society were a mixed bag overall due to pacing issues.  Many characters had their backstories given in an info dump in which the cast was so large not much characters had enough focus overall.\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment of the story was often from the story that started out very interesting.  I will also give credit that I like the returning cast of the show in which it follows Danganronpa lore pretty well.  The setting of the outside world was very interesting, and the story had some good impactful moments to it.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Danganronpa 3 future arc is a anime that has a great setting and premise, but occassionally falls short in terms of having a large cast with little time to establish them.  If you are a fan of thriller or a previous Danganronpa fan who wants to see how it ends I would reccomend this anime.",

            "content": "This review will contain spoilers, be warned. I love the Danganronpa series, both 1 and 2 were exciting, always kept me guessing, and had enjoyable characters, but I hated the endings for both. They were both inconclusive and used out-of-nowhere plot devices to sorta explain the bulk of the mystery(i.e the greatest tragedy in all of history) while also saying ehhh we'll fully explain it at a later time. Now here comes Danganronpa 3 promising to finally conclude this story with so many open plot lines like how did the greatest tragedy even occur? What happened to Makoto and Hinata after their game endings? Iwas intrigued yet skeptical.\\n\\n\r\nThe first big thing that popped out to me is that they decided to do this as an anime when the first two games were games, this was a big eyebrow shift, especially since the first game's anime adaption was heavily panned. The 12 episode anime was not a good call.\\n\\n\r\nFirst off, the animation is ugly. The distinct character designs from Danganronpa do not translate well to this animation, if you seen the first adapation, it's more of the same. The color palette is also extremely bland and darkly saturated, heavily contrasting with how colorful the games were (though blood is actually red now).\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is mostly from the games, though you will not hear most of the great tracks maybe more than once as this anime has no class trials. Overall, the music did not stand out when I watched this anime. The OP and ED songs are alright.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters... oof what a mess. So you have 16 characters, a few you already know from the games, in a 12 episode series. Thus, you will get short quick backstories to make you emphasize with this new characters before they die. It didn't work, I ended up caring for almost none of these characters. A lot of these characters quickly get into the new killing game and start attacking each other instantly and doing impulsive, unreasonable actions, it made me wonder how the Future Foundation lasted more than 1 day if all the top members were eager to kill each other at the drop of a hat. The big new character here is Munakata (Yuu Narukami lookalike), radical Hope guy that wanted to kill all despair. His motivations are thin and he's quick to kill all those he supposedly trusted for years. Towards the end of the anime, he's kind of thrown off into the sidelines and he gets a whatever conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing in this show is everywhere. It starts with the killing game going rapidly into the motion, everyone is in fear of the others and someone dies every episode, looks like it's gonna be following the games in its pacing. Oh, but then forget about the killing game, it goes into politics outside the killing game and even 1 whole episode dedicated to concluding the Ultimate Despair Girls game plotline (a spinoff featuring Makoto's sister, which was an action shooter rather than murder mystery game), which wasn't much to begin with. When it comes back to Makoto and gang its not a killing game anymore, now we're figuring out who's behind it all. It doesn't help that the anime focuses on so many characters at once, rather than just the protag like the games, there simply isn't enough time for everyone. The series only had 13 episodes and it shows with how disorganized everything felt.\\n\\n\r\nNow here's the big part, the plot. You know what I was saying about all the open plot lines and mystery explanations? The writers address them terribly. The great tragedy leading to the whole world thrown into chaos and despair is basically the result of a new character, Mitarai (Ultimate Animator). Enoshima convinced him to make a video that could brainwash people to despair. Literally, that's how the world went to hell, a high school genius was able to single handedly create a video that could destroy the world's social order. It seems like the writers wrote the games as they went along and didn't really think of a way to explain everything and kinda just pooped something out in the recent weeks. The killing game for the Future Foundation members was a plan by the FF chairman all just so Mitarai could upload a video that would brainwash everyone in the world with hope instead of despair. The chairman seriously thought killing all his top members just to convince one to upload a video of hope was a good idea, alright. The climax is disappointingly generic, Mitarai is at the countdown for the hope brainwash video to broadcasted, Hinata comes and is like there's still hope come with me, Mitarai. Mitarai says okay, cancels the hope brainwash broadcast and that end this whole ordeal. The anime was good at keeping me hooked, it always surprised me with new mysteries or crazy cliffhangers, but when it was time to explain these, well it didn't turn out so great. The ending gives some closure by showing the world is finally a good place, so that's something but the journey along the way is roughly-put together and overall disappointing. I hope Danganronpa V3 learns from this long, convoluted plot-line by making a self-contained world with plausible explanations.",

You can also read some light novels or manga if you wish, but it doesn't matter, because they don't connect to this anime anyway. Also, if you spend 50~ hours playing the games, I doubt that you'll be satisfied with this. And that is the biggest problem with it - it's unnecessary and feels completely off. The fans didn't like it and if you didn't play the games, you won't like it either. But at least, this thing is actually moreentertaining, than the Despair Arc, which left me with despair and despair only. There'll be minor spoilers ahead, but most of them are about games or things that won't ruin your \"fun\".\\n\\n\r\nSo what is Mirai-hen actually about? Well, after The Biggest, Most Awful, Most Tragic Event in Human History\u2122, the vast majority of humanity is gone. But, as we learn in Ultra Despair Girls and Danganronpa 2, there is still hope since The Future Foundation - mostly lead by former SHSL students - is trying to rebuild the world. Trying is probably the best word for this, because as we see in the first episode, it's not really that hard to kidnap the key figures of their leadership. So, yeah, it's another killing game, but this time it's more like Mafia game - there is a one traitor, that will kill one person, when the others are unconscious. If they don't kill anyone in one \"night\", then everyone else survives and the game ends. There are also a NG codes - which prohibits some of the actions. This is a really cool concept and while I was watching this, I really was curious about characters' NG codes. Also, who could be a traitor? This is way different than any other game, and it's done pretty well. \\n\r\nAs for the rest of the story... it's okay and has some cliffhangers. When it was airing, I though it's really cool and couldn't wait for next episode. But now? Some of the cliffhangers just don't work. They're really cheap and completely unnecessary. The rest of the story isn't good either. You're getting teased with something really cool and then... it's disappointing. And after that disappointment, we've got another one, but this time it's the laziest things ever. It's the type of twist that we saw in Zetsubou-hen. The story could work, but it doesn't. You can easily see things that would be amazing to see, but they aren't. And this is probably the worst thing. Wasted opportunities.  \\n\\n\r\nBut hey, it's Danganronpa! It never had a good story, so let's move to things that make Danganronpa amazing - characters. Oh boy. First things first, we've got our old survivors. They're all here apart from Togami, that couldn't arrive at meeting and Toko, who's chilling in Towa City. That leaves us with Makoto Naegi, who's still the main character, Kyoko Kirigiri, who is her normal self, Asahina Aoi, who... doesn't really do much, I guess? So she is exactly like she is in the game, yay! As for Yasuhiro Hagakure... yeah, he's still a comic relief. I like them as much as I liked them before, but they don't save the show. They feel like they were put here just to say sell this anime better. But hey, it's still nice to see them back. \\n\r\nWe've also got a completely new cast, that also appears in Zetsubou-hen. Not all of them, but only the important ones. The character that I personally liked is Ruruka Andou and her boyfriend, Sonosuke Izayoi. They aren't great personality-wise, but they've got nice designs. Ruruka is manipulative and mean and since I like this type of characters, I liked her too. She kinda reminds me of Hiyoko a.k.a Best Character from DR2. The next one is Izayoi. He doesn't talk very much, but he will do anything for the sweets... that's sound really stupid, doesn't it? Also he's got a nice trenchcoat, and all in all, I just liked him. There is also a Seiko Kimura, and she is socially awkward, and that's pretty much it, without spoiling the story. I didn't really care about this character, but many people did loved her.  \\n\r\nThe least important characters are Daisaku Bandai, who is obviously a joke character and Great Gozu - who is ex-wrestler and kind of a badass. The rest of the cast consists of Chisa Yukizome, about whom I wrote in Zetsubou-hen review, Juzo Sakakura, who is a douche, but at further investigation, he's also one of the best character in this anime. The other ones are Ryota Mitarai, who is similar to his Zetsubou-hen version, but crying way less this time, Koichi Kizakura, nonchalant guy, that is also a really cool character and the leader of Future Fundation, and Kazuo Tengan. The remaining two characters... are bit different. Miaya Gekkogahara is the most mysterious and interesting character of all, but they screw her up anyway. No human language can describe the disappointment after sixth episode. The last one is Yuu Narukami, or how is he called here, Kyosuke \"You know why\" Munakata a.k.a Muchkatana. He's the edgiest character in this universe (Izuru and Gundham don't count!) and has zero personality. I don't like him. He's bland, uninteresting and in some scenes, he's hilarious. And it's not intended. He's incompetent and blames Despair for everything. Even if it's his own fault.  \\n\r\nSo we've got a bunch of new and old characters, yet instead of being happy to see my favourites interacting with the new cast, I see nothing like that. Most of them die early or don't have any relationship with the main characters. Overall, they're a little better than characters in Zetsubou-hen, but not very much. \\n\\n\r\nI don't give a damn about art. In some moments it looked bad, but I didn't pay much attention to it in general. However the stylistic is darker than usual. It's not annoying, but I prefer the old one. The biggest difference, that every fan will notice, is the blood colour. It's red. I don't know if it was supposed to be more dark or realistic, I just hope that Danganronpa won't end up like the DC Cinematic Universe.  \\n\\n\r\nAs for the sound, it's very good. I really like both the OP and the END, the rest of music is also really nice. The old OST like New World Order were remastered, and they sound like they should. Voice actors did their best and like in Zetsubou-hen, the old cast kept their voices.   \\n\\n\r\nAnd now comes the final verdict - did I enjoyed this? Surprisingly, the first half of anime was entertaining. You've got more and more clues, there were multiple of theories, memes and questions about characters. It was fun. But I was watching it on streams, once a week, just when it was airing. And that's the problem. If you watch it now, it will take like 6 hours to complete. You won't probably come out with any theory, you won't notice small details that could prove that X character is traitor, the cliffhangers will be less dramatic. Not to mention the ending, which is really bad. Overall - you probably won't enjoy this as much as I did.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!\\n\\n",

            "content": "\"You know y Danganronpa the Animation was not good? It did not transcend the troll levels. Let's troll the world.\"\r\n-Kodaka, 2016\r\nThe art of trolling or what I like to refer as shock factor and pretentioussness galore is a rather modern art that has become so mainstream that anyone will try to do it and the one who does it the best gets recognized, while the rest become casual fodder or the elephants in \"The Room\" (I question my life with every breath I take. Please do not mind my antarctic cold humour). If recent memory serves me well, Arrival did the biggest fu troll inthe 21st century since the final episode from Lost and Heroes Reborn. I mean shit hit the fan so fast the last few minutes that the whole experience turned from a decent sci fi to a pretentious one-time novelty. The worst of all was Knowing which trolled with you from the beginning in favor to babyfeed you preachy material. Well, Danganronpa 3 Future Arc is just average. It had a few trolls and the last episode made me feel the whole arc was pointless. \\n\\n\r\nSo what did this arc from the new season improve on? Well, the only department that it did improve on was sound. It was actually good. OP was decent and ED was great by TRUSTICK. OST was decent to good. It paid good hommage to the games.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and art are slightly better but the monochromicity in this show is just baffling. It made everything look soulless. Otherwise, it was a zoozed-up edition of the original.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now where the show caught horse shit. The story was a troll. It began promising you gore, mystery and lots of action. It gave that but as it went through you could feel the presence of the troll laughing at your ass for thinking it will end on a good note. Kodaka did his ass-pulling again and made every fan of the series scream with rage in the end, because let's face it...money makes the world go round. It is unfortunately true and Future Arc shows exactly that. Look where Michael Bay is at.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are as unitneresting as looking at a white canvas, except the mains. Naegi is still the same Hope-filled twat as he was. Kirigiri is still best waifu and everyone's favorite low EQ girl and \\n\r\nAsahina is donut girl (insert Tenshi no Drop jokes). To be honest they tried to make us give a fuck but failed to a laughable level with a few characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I did not think this would suck more than the original but Kodaka and his masterful trolls managed to prove us wrong...again.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5.50/10\\n\\n\r\nAlternative Recommendation:\\n\\n\r\n-Despair Arc: Actually, worth your time.\\n\r\n-Mirai Nikki: If you loved this series, you are going to love this trashy guilty pleasure of mine.\\n\\n\\n\\n",
