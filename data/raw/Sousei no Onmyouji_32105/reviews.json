            "content": "Sousei no Onmyouji was really high in the expectations in my book, especially since the author of Naruto himself recommended reading the manga. Well, I guess Naruto fans might enjoy it, but I sure as heck DIDN'T.\r\n__________________________________________________________________________\r\nSTORY: 1/10\r\nBehold, the insanely unique story about heroes beating monsters! Yeah. That's it. Oh, I guess there's a parallel world too, because that makes it an absolute must watch!\r\nsarcasm\r\n/\u02c8s\u00e4r\u02cckaz\u0259m/\r\nnoun\r\nthe use of irony to mock or convey contempt.\r\nIn all seriousness, the plot of Sousei no Onmyouji is completely ripped through and through, and I honestly have nothing good to say about it, so I'll make this short: If you havewatched ANY SHONEN EVER, I don't recommend watching this, as the shonen you saw was probably far superior.\\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nART: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nI've actually seen quite a bit of people compliment the series for it's flashy art style, which surprises me. Until I visited a couple online forums, I had thought nothing but 'below average' while watching the show. The animation, I would still say, is below average, the action looking rather bland (and, lets be honest, who cares about what else animation does in a shonen), but I will admit to the art style being better than I had initially thought. The bright colors are rather nice, and it definitely makes the scenes more distinguishable from other series.\\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nSOUND: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is mediocre through and through. Everything is generic, even the opening with it's nice sound, has lost it's affect on me already, and I'm realizing just how little I care about things like the voice acting, sound effects, and soundtrack of the show. There isn't much to compliment, but hey, it could be worse!\\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 1/10\\n\\n\r\nI can't contain myself watching those two...... You have your typical overpowered main character, and the kuudere lead that makes him blush all the time. The characters have absolutely no depth, and the supporting characters aren't really given enough reason to be cared about, even though they have more potential then our lead characters ever did.....\\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nOVERALL: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, unless you're the guy who never gets bored with cliches, I can't recommend this show to you. Sousei no Onmyouji was a pathetic choice for a recommendation Mashimata, though he did recommend the manga, so I won't rant on him to much. Well, at the very least, the anime is not worth your time.",

            "content": "I feel that these 8.5 words describe the entirety of this anime: \r\n\u201cCliche Archetype-filled Exorcist Shounen With Many Crappy Plot Twists\u201d\r\nI have very mixed feelings about this show\u2026\r\n- Sometimes I thought, \u201cOh, this is such a cool kiddy shounen!\u201d\r\n- Sometimes I became angry at how stupid and immature the characters were.\r\n- I often skipped through some of the many slow scenes and flashbacks.\r\n- Sometimes I even said, \u201cWhoa! Didn\u2019t see that coming! Is this really a kids show? wtf?\u201d when some pretty dark things happened\r\n- However, most importantly, by the end I thought to myself \u201cWow, this is pretty fucking bad.\u201d\r\nI honestly thought this showwas going to be pretty average at first (5 out of 10). Then I thought, \u201cOh wow! This is actually pretty good!\u201d from 9 to 37-ish (7/10). However, towards the end the show started pulling both random and shitty plot twists out of its ass, and then shooting them at us like it\u2019s a \u201cshit machine-gun\u201d (2/10)...\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR at the end\\n\\n\r\nStory:(4/10) \\n\r\nThe story mainly follows two cliche and initially overpowered main protagonists named \u201cRokuro\u201d and \u201cBenio\u201d as they overcome many hard trials thereby growing stronger and closer together displaying mild romance. They\u2019re prophesized to be the \u201ctwin stars\u201d or two chosen exorcists that will get married, have a baby, and the baby will be the most powerful exorcist called the \u201cmiko\u201d (basically something like a baby Jesus that will save the world from all of the evil kegare monsters). The evil kegare monsters are sealed in an alternate dimension called \u201cmegano\u201d, where the exorcists must go to fight them. Almost all of the characters are slowly introduced with background stories that are supposed to be tragic, but their backgrounds came across as overly done to the point where it was kind of just stupid-silly after a while. The story emphasizes that Rokuro and Benio both want to get stronger... and they do... At a snail\u2019s rate anyways, but no worries because they often get sudden power ups out of nowhere. Mm~ sudden power ups. My favorite\u2026 (sarcasm)\\n\\n\r\nThe story really doesn\u2019t have any depth, and it certainly isn\u2019t realistic. For example, one of the main antagonists is basically just some psychotic kid with attachment issues. One thing that really pissed me off is that all of the villains kept saying phrases like:\\n\\n\r\n\"I am all powerful! and you are weak!\" \\n\r\n\u201cIt is no use for you to try to win!\u201d\\n\r\n\u201cOh, but it was all part of my master plan!\u201d \\n\r\n\u201cTHIS TOO IS PART OF MY MASTER PLAN!\u201d \\n\r\nand then the shitty plot twist that I mentioned earlier would be another antagonist saying, \\n\r\n\u201cBut your master plan was part of my SUPER master plan ALL ALONG! I have been using you, lesser antagonist, this whole time!\u201d \\n\r\nI often just sat in my chair, apathetic to all of the bullshit that the characters kept pulling out of their asses.\\n\\n\r\nI feel the story\u2019s pace was much too slow, often dwelling much too long on the characterization and development of the twin stars. It wasn\u2019t really exciting, so I didn\u2019t feel like waiting to watch each new episode once a week. I actually ended up binge-watching once every four months. It had its ups and downs. It\u2019s a pretty a pretty bad story overall. Towards the end, we randomly got hit with some pedophile plot twist shit, and I honestly don\u2019t know what the hell to make of this anime anymore. It had its moments, but the story was actually pretty bad overall. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt:(5/10)\\n\r\nThe art in the fight scenes sometimes looks like it\u2019s from a game where they pause and call out the name of their attack with an epic pose before actually doing it. Everything freezes when this happens, so it adds a certain \"style\" to the art.\\n\\n\r\nThe art's okay overall, but I feel that the series would be more appealing if the characters weren't so... bright and cute...? Except there's one thing that gets to me every time... It's Rokuro... There are scenes when his art turns into something out of a horror movie.  The animation is not the best with many still-frames and lack of dramatic camera angles. The art's fine overall.\\n\\n\r\nSound:(8/10) \\n\r\nWhat can I say? They did a pretty good job on the sound. The OST is mainly dubstep, which threw me off at first, but I kind of like it now. The fighting works well, background music fits completely and enhances the setting. Openings and endings are also very fitting. It's actually relatively unique, but it's not special or powerful like something like something Yuki Kajiura or Sawano Hiroyuki would make. Only one OST was memorable for me until episode 27's opening theme. But now that I finished the anime, I actually occasionally catch myself thinking about their OSTs! (I guess 50 episodes of an anime will do that to you).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: (4/10)\\n\r\nThe characters were okay, at best. However, towards the end, they ended up having little to no real depth at all. In general, they\u2019re  pretty much just average characters with nothing much special about them except for Rokuro's shark teeth (main male character). I initially hated both Rokuro and Benio, but, I actually started liking the main characters around episode 14/15 after they unnecessarily spent all of that time developing the twin stars. However, they're basically just kids with sad background stories tasked with saving the world from Kegare. Honestly, they probably could have made this series into about 24 episodes if they skipped the unnecessary development episodes. \\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of side characters with the potential to be interesting, but they all got little to no development. The dynamic between Benio and Rokuro is pretty nice to watch, but there's nothing too special here. Rokuro's starts off as kind of annoying, fiery, not that smart, and overpowered, but the enemies do get much stronger and Rokuro matures quite a bit and actually becomes a pretty cool character. Benio is the typical smart, cool, amazingly strong, but lonely character. She too grows as the series progresses.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (?/10)\\n\r\nThis show\u2026 is hard to describe in terms of enjoyment... At first, it was fun because it reminded me of a cool game (7/10). As it progressed, the initial excitement died down (5/10). It was very predictable up until a certain point, but things started becoming less predictable as it progressed (7/10). Some of the plot twists were cool, but the plot twists towards the end were just plain stupid (2/10).  In fact, I was legitimately shocked by how ridiculous and incoherent it started getting. It's definitely more suited to a younger less mature audience, but there are some aspects of the anime that are unexpectedly dark for a kids show. An older audience may still enjoy it because it's somewhat entertaining (maybe), although you probably won't be able to relate to it much as an older individual. \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR \\n\r\nOverall: (5/10)\\n\r\nThe story progressed too slowly, they took too long to develop the MCs, the characters were too cliche, but the anime wasn\u2019t all that bad and actually had a decent amount of good moments. The show is bearable, but I wouldn\u2019t recommend this anime to you unless you\u2019ve already seen a bunch of the other top shounen out there. So basically, it was pretty bad and I think your time would be better spent elsewhere. \\n\\n\r\n\u201cDo I recommend this to you personally?\u201d\\n\r\nPersonally? Absolutely not. I could never wholeheartedly recommend this anime to anyone. It\u2019s just something I watched to kill time.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, if you like exorcists and shounen anime, are younger than 16, and like slow stories, then maybe you should give it a shot someday. \\n\\n\r\nIf you want realistic and mature characters, then no you should look elsewhere.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, you probably should just look elsewhere unless you\u2019re out of anime to watch. \\n\\n\r\nI strongly recommend that you check out these other similar, but better exorcist/demon-related shounen anime first if you haven\u2019t already:\\n\r\n1. D. Gray Man 9/10 (103 eps) The second season 8/10 (13 eps) came 10 years later \\n\r\n2. Bleach 9/10 (366 eps)\\n\r\n3. Ao no Exorcist 9/10 (37 eps between 2 seasons)\\n\r\n4. Nurarihyon no Mago 9/10  (50 eps between 2 seasons)\\n\r\n5. Shakugan no Shana 8/10 (76 eps between 3 seasons)\\n\\n\r\n(if you agree or enjoyed reading, let me and others know by clicking helpful or commenting on my page~ If you disagree let me know why you disagree so I can do better next time! thanks~)",

            "content": "Dropped after episode 29.\r\nSousei no Onmyouji is Spring 2016 season's average shounen anime with a theme that has already been used many times. It might seem at least a bit nice at first but, it quickly becomes a somewhat repetitive and uninteresting ride. However, the anime has a little special charm of its own and decently developed characters (at least, before the original arc). But, is that enough to call Sousei no Onmyouji a good anime?\r\nStory: 4/10\r\nThe story of Sousei no Onmyouji, isn't something new or very original, as we have already seen lots of anime that center on certain people who possess a specialability (Exorcists) and fight against supernatural enemies (Kegare) in order to protect the world. The problem is not that it uses an overused theme, the anime does have a little charm of its own but, it doesn't manage it in a way that will make it less clich\u00e9. Also, it doesn't give anything interesting enough to get hooked on and you just end up watching a story with almost no impact on you. The story had potential to be much better but, it depended on predictable shounen elements and was pretty much wasted. \\n\r\nThe romance between the two main characters shows a little progression after a few episodes and some of their interactions contribute to it. Although, there are others which are only supposed to be funny but, they end up meaningless and annoying. The humor of the show isn't that funny, most of the jokes fall flat and they even repeat some of them often. The random fan-service that they add from time to time, also, feels out of place and doesn't contribute to any aspect of the anime. \\n\r\nPutting a filler arc after a major time-skip that would have contributed to the development of the main characters and their relationship, wasn't a good idea, either. At the end of episode 20, the main characters decide to live in a different place together for a couple of years in order to become stronger. So, you would expect them to become stronger, more developed as characters and their relationship to actually have progressed a little, right? Unfortunately, due to the arc following the time skip being an anime original, they probably didn't know how to handle the story and characters in a way that will actually make it obvious that two whole years have passed so, everything remained the same and the time-skip didn't even make any sense.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10\\n\r\nAt first, the characters seem as dull and insignificant as the story. Their personalities may still be kind of flat and boring but, their chemistry, interactions and development is what makes things better.\\n\r\nThe protagonist, Rokuro, seems to be a powerful character who doesn't want to return to being an Exorcist, because of a dramatic childhood experience. He is the kind of MC with not much depth, mostly cheerful but, kind of annoying, too, wants to always protect others and become stronger and his actions are all predictable.\\n\r\nThe main female character, Benio, also didn't use to have much to be described with. She was the cool and silent type of character and another powerful Exorcist but, after a few episodes, she showed us a friendlier and more sensitive side of her.\\n\r\nThe two main characters may receive development after a lot of episodes, but it happens in pretty much the same way all the time. Something bad happens, they think they are strong and they can face it, they fail, they get angry and cry, they get overpowered, they win. Then again the same thing from the beginning. It is a positive thing that they received character development but, the way it is done can end up repetitive and not very exciting.\\n\r\nThe chemistry between them has become better. They got to know and care about each other more, each of them wants to protect the other and they feel stronger when they fight together. Their more romantic interactions can sometimes be funny and cute and actually contribute to the development of their relationship but, there are times that they can be pretty meaningless and clich\u00e9.\\n\r\nUnfortunately, despite all the development they managed to get, they remained completely the same after the time-skip, which makes you wonder if it was even necessary.\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast is rather forgettable, most of the characters are just there to fill their role and they receive little to no development, at all.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 5/10\\n\r\nThe art of Sousei no Onmyouji may not the best and most detailed out there, but it's quite satisfying. Although, personally, I'm not really a fan of the art style and the bright colours, but that's a matter of opinion, and it may also be a good point of the anime, because it gives it a somewhat special touch. The biggest problem here is how terrible the animation is most of the time. Scenes that are often reused, the same movement patterns again and again, overusing images with no motion at all and generally, the show is poorly animated. It might be something that you can get used to quite easily, but it is kind of off-putting to watch action scenes without the impact that they should have.\\n\r\nFortunately, as more episodes come out, art and animation seem to become slightly better, although I wish they were at the level of the 2nd OP of the series, only this one was really well done when it comes to animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nThere is not much to say here, as the first OP (\"Valkyrie -Ikusa Otome-\" by Wagakki Band) and ED (\"Eyes\" by Hitomi Kaji) seem to be fine and the OST is decent enough, but they become uninteresting after a while. The second ED (\"Yadoriboshi\" by Itowokashi) wasn't significant either, but the second OP (\"Re:Call\" by i\u2606Ris) was actually quite good and the animation was the best they've used so far. The third OP (\"Sync\" by lol) is rather bland and the first part can feel a little out of place but, the third ED (\"Hide and Seek\" by Girlfriend) is more lively and enjoyable than the other two.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2/10\\n\r\nI don't really think that Sousei no Onmyouji can offer much enjoyment, watching it ended up a chore after a few episodes and the original arc made everything worse.\\n\r\nSousei no Onmyouji has some cool classic shounen moments but, they are not extremely worth watching and there are other anime where they are done better. The humor isn't the strong point of the anime, as most of the jokes fall flat and it gets repetitive after a while. If you like romance in shounen anime, this one offers some but, don't expect too much. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\r\nSousei no Onmyouji falls into a category of anime with a theme which has been used many times by series greater and more amusing. There are many things that could be done about the story, characters and animation to become better but, it ended up as wasted potential. If you don't mind watching another average shounen anime with nothing much to offer to the genre, you can go ahead and give it a try.",

            "content": "The word 'adaptation' for anime has quite a flexible definition.  Most often, the term 'adaptation' means that the production company takes the source material and tries their best to make a carbon copy of the series that they decided to make in animated form.  But at the same time, the word 'adaptation' can mean \"based on\" the original source material, and have their own anime-original plots and endings that contradict what the original series may have entailed.  Twinstar Exorcists, or Sousei no Omnyouji is an example of the latter.  \r\nStory: The world we live in is a place that exists parallelto its antithesis, a place known as Magano.  In it, the negative thoughts of humans merge together and form creatures of corruption and sin known as 'Kegare'.  Kegare feed off of the spirtual power of humans and are destructive creatures that threaten the world we know.  In order to combat this, there are people known as Omnyouji with high spiritual power and battle the Kegare in a never-ending war to save humanity from their power.  To save humanity, the power of the Miko, a being born from the twinstar exorcists must be brought into the world.  Who are the twinstar exorcists?  Some shithead named Rokuro and an equally prissy girl named Benio.  Oh boy...\\n\\n\r\nOmnyouji's story is in short, arduous.  Spanning 50 episodes of content, what we're given as a plot is, in simple terms, a slew of shonen tropes that span from the power of friendship, all the way to wanting to save everybody, and sudden bursts of power because, plot convenience.  Despite being an adaptation of a relatively popular series, Omnyouji doesn't have much to offer.  It becomes painfully easy to see what comes our way, and a lot of what it is boils down to ham-handed philosophies of two opponents fighting each other with fists clenched while shouting each other's names.  Rinse and repeat that process over twenty times over, and you have what roughly equates to the entire show's runtime in a flash.\\n\\n\r\nThe main attributer as to why the show is so devoid of any originality or interesting developments is because, rather than following what the manga had already mapped out for Perriot to adapt, the studio decided to take a different turn and by Episode 20, change the show's path down an anime original path that has no connection to its original source material at all.  This proved to be a very big contributor as to why the show has such big flaws with its story, as the saga we're introduced to turns the show into a display of power as our protagonists \"get stronger\" as more and more opponents get introduced for no other reason than to make the penultimate plot of \"The end of the world is coming\" a reality for the end so that the show would have some form of grand finale.  \\n\\n\r\nAnother problem comes with how I feel as though the show had too much time.  Most often than not, the case of screentime boils down to not having enough time for a series in order to tell the story that was intended.  Many episodes felt like throwaway episodes, as the show would squander its screentime with flashbacks that have already been shown many times over, recaps of what happened in the last ten or so episodes, or would have episodes solely devoted to talking just to fill up the twenty-four minutes that were allotted for the episode.  As such, episodes like this added to the weariness of how Omnyouji displayed itself, making the what was already tedious, even more tedious to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOmnyouji's problems arose when trying to milk what had already been drained dry.  The show doesn't try anything new in the realm of shonen anime, as the roughly twenty five hours it takes to watch this series can be described with just a tropes that almost every shonen anime uses in its plotline.  That, combined with how slow some of the episodes feel, and how predictable everything is, ultimately creates a tiring experience that isn't worth the time or effort to have.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n- All the shonen tropes\\n\r\n- Predictable story\\n\r\n- Many pointless episodes\\n\r\n- Deviation from the source material did not work\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Likewise, characters have the similar problem with being your run of the mill shonen tropes without what seems like little to no thought with how to make them interesting beyond what they're given.\\n\\n\r\nBoth of our main characters, Enmado Rokuro and Adashino Benio start off the series hating each other's guts.  With the series intentionally pairing them up in order to bring the Miko into the world, it's no surprise by what the end result of the series becomes.  The pair of Omnyouji are as expected.  You have the reckless, brash boy who listens to no one and wants to get stronger with his own strength and his own merits, and you have the girl who doesn't like the boy (at the beginning) who also wants to get stronger and basically has the exact same goals that the boy does.  The character progression for the relationship between these two is noticeable and gradual, which is something that I believe that the show does well on.  However, as far as everything else is concerned, that's about where the positives end.  Their goals are nothing special, their progression is somewhat minimal, and the show makes it very hard for them to lose.  They may struggle, but everything turns out extremely ok at the end.  They're boring.  They're boring because the show doesn't even attempt to make their pains and struggles seem minimal when everything just comes to them so easily, and it becomes very hard to care for characters who despite everything, have plot armor so thick that not even someone who is virtually god can't break through it.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as villains go, most if not all can be described as characters who have a single goal that serves as an obstacle that can easily be overcome once given enough episodes.  Become the best, take over the world, destroy humanity; all of these goals have been done over and over again in more interesting ways that have been displayed here.  It doesn't help that the villains spend more time talking than executing their evil plan, or hell, let the protagonist live when they could easily kill them, so they become minor hurdles that the characters have to jump over to continue on with the story.  \\n\\n\r\nSide characters are a wide bunch that, like most long-running shonen series, are either the friends that the main protagonists are fighting for, and are the less than stellar characters of the same kind who will never amount to anything when compared to the feats that the main protagonists have achieved.  They're your standard group of side characters in a shonen series, and there're very few if any noteworthy characters to talk about since they're largely tropes like; the third wheel, the mentor, the annoying mascot, and rivals.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Character development for the protagonists\\n\r\n-  Entire cast feels like a giant soup of tropes\\n\\n\r\nArt: Perriot's art shines as an example of inconsistency and quality issues.  While normally the show has a lot of blunt and bright colors that are less than stellar in quality, the main problem with Omnyouji's art is how consistent the company is with making their scenes.  \\n\\n\r\nWhen the show wants to, the lighting and the shadows can make the scene look good enough to actually look good.  However, when the show doesn't want to, the art looks like a mess of colors combined with clear flaws in the details when it comes to characters' appearance.  Fight scenes in a supposedly action heavy series are mostly characters standing and talking about each of their side and philosophies while not mercilessly beating the crap out of each other.  A one-two punch, a lot of talking, some more punching, a lot more talking, and end the fight.  The fight scenes hardly have any 'fight' in them, so they feel very disengaging and unexciting to watch.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Can look good\\n\r\n- Largely inconsistent\\n\r\n- Minimalistic fight scenes\\n\\n\r\nSound: Omnyouji's soundtracks are not memorable.  Being roughly 4 cours long, the show has 4 pairs of OPs and EDs that help run the show's opening and ending bits to section off each of the four parts that the show's in.  Despite having watched all of the songs in full, none of the tracks stick out to me in my head as something that was both enjoyable or memorable.  So if you ask me, the tracks are not worth your time.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: It's been about a year since I started watching the first episode, and I honestly can't remember the reason why I even started it in the first place.  Coming out of it though, Omnyouji stands as a show that ultimately was a huge waste of time.  Nothing about it made me excited about watching the next episode, and slogging through episode after episode felt like a tiring excavation to find any glint of originality to make me interested in the series.  The shift from the source material certainly didn't help its case, as the random encounters with new anime-original villains didn't do anything but make the series even more difficult to like.  \\n\\n\r\nDid I like this series?\\n\\n\r\nFor me, there's nothing to like.  You can find better examples of everything this show did elsewhere.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this series?\\n\\n\r\nThough I'm tempted to say 'everything', the biggest problem I had was with Benio's shikigami, Kinako.  Kinako's high screechy voice shouting at the top of his lungs was like nails on a chalkboard.  He wasn't cute, was extremely annoying, and became a huge hindrance to the series because his constant shouting and attempts at 'helping' had me in a tizzy on whether or not I should finish the show, or quit halfway.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime?\\n\\n\r\nTo me, Omnyouji is not worth it.  Reusing almost every shonen trope that exists, Omnyouji's adaptation has almost nothing original about it as its largely anime-original plot turns its 50 episode runtime into a bingo game to see if you can get a bingo from all of the tropes that they shove into the series.  Its lack of originality makes it a tiring experience to have, and I for one am thankful that it's over.  Because there is no way I'm ever going to watch a 50 episode on-going series ever again.",

BTW It gets and actual ending, i mean, if this is what we got from TSE im satiesfied(6/10)\\n\\n\r\nAs usual in a seres who is make week by week for  a full year, it might suffer for the inconstanst quiality in the animation, but is fairly consistent trough the whole series. There are moments where you will say, \"this look good\", at other times you will say... \"ahhh ok...\" (6/10)\\n\\n\r\nIm not a musician i cant jugde the OST from that view, but i can say it gets the job done, you'll remember the songs time to time but they will not get stuck in your head or wanna add them to your playlists\\n\r\nExcept the OP and ED, props to all of them, specially the 2nd OP and the 3er ED (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nI think the strongest thing this series are their characters, the series focus a lot in the relatioship between Benio and Rokuro, how in the begening they hate each other to accept their flaws and praise their strengns. \\n\r\nWhile in the other hand they neglet mostly of the support cast, wich are really good, each character of the supporting cast has their own story but only some of them get screentime to develop that, while other doesnt get any at all, but i see this was done to focus in the protagonists (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nMy personal experience was week by week, sometimes i ended really satisfied for what i watched and enjoyed, other times i ended dissapointed BUT with the hope that it would be better the next week. But yeah i enjoy it all, just not that much some weeks",

I've seen many anime's where the art didn't even deserve a rating. there is literally about a handful of anime's that have a rating that's above a 6 in my opinion.\r\nI have nothing to say, what's great is great. but i gave it a 9/10 not just because i liked it but because just fit withthe anime like a puzzle meshed together well.\\n\\n\r\nI have nothing bad to say but i wished they put a little bit more detail into the MC's personality's. Benio is cold hearted and non-sociable but on the inside she's sweet kind and caring, you just have to get to know her. while the other MC is hot headed, hot blooded, and annoying but when he is in battle all of that changes you could call it an alter ego, he becomes brave, strong, and serious but it's not just that but his friends mean more to him than anything.\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment is purely and solely on my opinion. the reason i gave it a 10/10 is because i judge every anime i watch on their first episode so if this anime's first episode didn't interest me i wouldn't have watched the rest of the anime and most likely wouldn't have reviewed.\\n\\n\r\nOverall if you don't like cliche's then i would strongly suggest that you don't watch this anime, while as the plot is a cliche the first episode is a cliche in it's self.

It took them almost two years to realize the Naruto manga was over and they can stop doing anime fillers, and now they\u2019re doing this show called Twin Star Exorcists (listed here as Sousei no Onmyouji), an anime that feels like it should\u2019ve been released a good ten years ago. Main character has a rowdy side of his otherwisecasual personality that comes with a tragic backstory, and he wants to be the best at whatever; main heroine is actually good at whatever, pretty attractive but not fanservice-y, hates the MC for whatever reason but you know they\u2019re gonna fuck someday anyway, and they have to fight some stuff. Lots of fighting. Yippee. \\n\\n\r\n\u201cOh boy, this guy\u2019s another elitist who just complains about shows by comparing it to other anime!\u201d Nah, I\u2019m okay with shows being similar; in fact, some of the frontrunners that aired alongside this show are pretty basic and I love them a lot, but they have their reasons for being watchable. Sousei doesn\u2019t do a lot to differentiate itself from the tropes it uses; most of its appeal as an action is merely weighted on its gimmicky combat, which incorporates traditional Japanese elements a bit. \\n\\n\r\n- TRADITIONAL JAPENESE ELEMENTS - *poof*\\n\r\nHYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s every fucking fight. Someone will say an attack, then time will stop so the name of the attack can appear on the screen and the person can yell. Does it look cool? Yes. But just because it looks cool doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s necessary, so after about two instances it gets pretty damn irritating and makes me feel like I\u2019m being looked down upon.\\n\\n\r\nActually, Sousei just seems to look down on its viewers in general. A lot. One of several things is that whenever someone reflects upon something, a terrible-looking flashback will be shown of that event or quote, even if it happened five minutes prior. Even worse is that a character was made exclusively for the anime, whose only purpose is to suck the heroine\u2019s dick. EVERYTHING that\u2019s said by this Victini-looking motherfucker is just to make play up how badass Benio is so that maybe you\u2019ll like her more. \u201cHEY, IMP! (?) YOUR USELESS ASS IS HOLDING BACK BENIO\u2019S AMAZING TALENT!!!\u201d This isn\u2019t complicated writing, Pierrot. Mommy says I\u2019m a big boy now, so I can understand basic human emotions all by my alone.\\n\\n\r\nIf you actually want to know what the story\u2019s about and don\u2019t want to read the synopsis or other \u201cobjective\u201d reviewers, it\u2019s about our world if it had a bunch of creepy, weirdo interdimensional things called \u2018karaage\u2019, which\u2026 do\u2026 bad things. To people. Come to think of it, I don\u2019t remember getting a good explanation of these things. Except that they\u2019re bad. Are they bad? I guess they\u2019re bad\u2026 They look creepy so they must be bad. And then people who aren\u2019t bad perform exorcisms on them; in other words they do action-y stuff in special costumes and use magic with talismen.\\n\\n\r\n- TALISMEN - *poof*\\n\r\nAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH\\n\\n\r\nThat also has something to do with it, I guess.\\n\\n\r\nThe real kick of this story is that the two main characters are being forced to get married, hook up, and have a kid together. Twin Star Exorcists? More like Twin Star SEXorcists!!! AHHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, they need to breed because somehow their kid will inevitably become the Hokag--ehsorry the Miko or whatever. Which is like the best exorcist ever. This kills the karaage. I appreciate that Sousei doesn\u2019t beat around the bush with these two, you know they\u2019re gonna hook up by the end anyway, but now that fanfiction-generating quirk has actual weight to the story. And instead of having the two fuck like wild rabbits, they have a typical but effective dichotomy between liking and hating each other. I\u2019ll admit that I don\u2019t like Rokuro much, but Benio\u2019s cool, and more importantly they have a weird chemistry that makes their relationship fun sometimes.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget about their complicated backstories!\u201d\\n\r\nYeah\u2026 I won\u2019t talk about how corny that is. You can probably find the basics of it on 4chan\u2019s \u201cwrite an anime plot\u201d threads.\\n\\n\r\nThe backstory and villainous reveal could actually considered to be a good part of the series, as it adds a lot of drama and really darkens the story even if it wasn\u2019t all that cheery to begin with, but it plays out in such a typical and over-the-top way that I started to laugh at it instead. But, to be knocked down means you come back stronger, right? So after a grim reveal and crushing defeat comes\u2026 an awkward couple of episodes of the two kids \u201ctraining\u201d by \u201cbonding\u201d together through some weird exercises. Oh. \\n\\n\r\nSince the romance is what makes Shipping no Onmyouji possibly stand out in the crowd, they should make it count, right? \u2026Eh. One, the characters aren\u2019t that interesting to begin with. Two, a lot of it is just\u2026 awkward. Much of it is forced--no, literally, it\u2019s forced by other characters because they want them to fuck immediately so they can have a kid and so the kid can save everyone, and so Benio and Rokuro get thrown into some strange shenanigans that force them to cooperate. Oh boy, I really feel the love in the air! I think putting the two in a nice villa was a good move, but everything else just seemed excessive and annoying. Little of it is about Rokuro and Benio growing as people and getting attached to each other, it\u2019s about them reluctantly playing a shitty game by one of their bosses. I guess down the line this could evolve into a good romance, but I think thirteen episodes is a bit too long of a wait for what should be a major draw to this series.\\n\\n\r\nLast thing I\u2019ll mention before moving on, but there\u2019s a lot of filler in this anime, as could be expected from a fifty-episode series by Pierrot. A lot of episodes have some sort of nonsense going on between Rokuro and Benio, and to make it seem important somehow, the firefox fuckwit mascot character will make an incredibly irritating scream about karaage showing up, so a little bit of action will happen. There\u2019s slow pacing, and in the case of Sousei, there\u2019s just general dicking around.\\n\\n\r\nAlright, now the art. This has potential, I\u2019ll give it that. If this show was brought down to even two cours, this would probably look pretty great. But unfortunately, Pierrot doesn\u2019t want to spend all eighty-nine quadrillionteen yen they made off Osomatsu-san to make the whole product look good. Therefore, faces often look janky and off-model at even the slightest of distances, and what little animation Sousei has is pretty weak. The actual character designs look good, though, with some rather beautiful eyes (to the animator guy saying that eyes take too long to draw nowadays, sorry) and good clothing. Rokuro has some weird shark teeth, but I think it\u2019s okay given his character and design.\\n\\n\r\nStylistically, it\u2019s interesting. The action takes place in another dimension, a very desolate and apocalyptic-looking dimension with a lot of red shading and outlines. The karaage are incredibly off-putting, weird, shadowy monsters that occupy it; altogether it brings about an interesting setting. Unfortunately, the setting is all it can be: a setting, so it doesn\u2019t make the actual fights look great, which is a shame because I quite like the idea of using magic with talismen and shit.\\n\\n\r\nLess ideally, all the flashbacks seem to have been filmed from an iPhone; the aspect ratio becomes more vertical and looks super awkward, and they fill the empty spaces on the sides with some distracting, scratchy graphics. What\u2019s with this weird design? If this was trying to be original, that doesn\u2019t mean it was a good idea either way. And since this is your average shounen, get ready for 25% of the episode to be composed of flashbacks.\\n\\n\r\nThe one notable thing about the sound is the hellish, creepy \u201cvoices\u201d of the karaage. It\u2019s fucking bizarre and I love it. Other than that, everything here\u2019s another mixed bag of mediocre. The OP is by Wagakki Band, another interesting gimmick J-rock band that combines hard rock with traditional Japanese elements.\\n\\n\r\n- TRADITIONAL JAPANEoh i did this meme already.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, if you\u2019re into Japanese music these days, you\u2019ve probably heard of their song, Senbonzakura, which blends these styles really well. Valkyrie, the Sousei OP, is a different story; the song itself sounds decent, but if you took out the traditional instruments then you wouldn\u2019t have much of a difference. Thematically, it\u2019s still a good choice for the show, I guess. The actual OST should\u2019ve taken some notes with Wagakki Band\u2019s ideas by blending traditional and modern sounds; instead it just sounds modern with some shitty electronic music playing in the back of the fights and some softer piano tunes wherever else. \\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend Sousei no Onmyouji? Based off of this first cour, I wouldn\u2019t. There are some good ideas, but nothing\u2019s really getting done here, and saying \u201cit gets better later\u201d doesn\u2019t really prove a point. In the six+ hours it\u2019ll take for Sousei to \u201cget better\u201d you could\u2026 read the manga, which people have apologetically claimed to be a much better experience, and given the amount of filler here I can see that. \\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend Sousei no Onmyouji? ...More like NOsei!!! 0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o\\n\\n\r\nStory - 3/10\\n\r\nArt - 4/10\\n\r\nSound - 3/10\\n\r\nCharacter - 4/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 2/10\\n\r\nShipping - eh/10\\n\r\nOverall - 3/10\\n\r\nFavorite character - Benio\\n\r\nFavorite episode - 13 until they did that stupid fusion attack\\n\r\nRecommendation level - Low",

            "content": "So I see a lot of people give this show negative reviews, usually 4's, but let me tell you, it's worse than that. \r\nThis show is literally the most generic thing ever. It has nothing going for it at all. The characters suck, the romance that's forced on the characters sucks and has no bearing on the series as a whole, the art sucks and the fights are boring, and the story is overdone to all hell. We get it, for no real reason, these two characters gotta make a baby. \r\nSo the two main characters are a tsundere boy and a kuudere girl. Tsundereboy has a tragic past and doesn't want to be an exorcist, but he's not good at anything else. At all. He's horrible at everything but he has the overpowered ability but they even managed to make that boring because he only really uses that one ability and it's just a punch. The kuudere girl is also overpowered, she's smart, she's cute and is better than the boy in every way. They try to give her a personality but the writers just make her do whatever to fit the scene, rather than have her character naturally react to what happens in the scene. Every other character is uninteresting or annoying, especially the girl's pet and the head exorcist guy. \\n\\n\r\nThe art consists mainly of stills in fight scenes and there's nothing interesting about it. It's a very \"anime\" art style that people who don't know much about anime would imagine every show looks like. The colors are kinda interesting sometimes, but not that eye catching. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is literally just, \"you two make a baby that will be ultra strong lol. But we don't wanna. WELL I'LL MAKE YOU BY MAKING YOU DO STUPID STUFF THAT WILL HOPEFULLY MAKE YOU LIKE EACHOTHER\" Anime like this where the story relies on romance, but for whatever reason the romance is actively avoided by the characters really annoy me. For the most part, the two main characters avoid the romance and don't even really talk about or even consider their \"destiny\". They both care about getting rid of the bad guys and protecting their friends, but they won't even consider just making a baby so they could permanently destroy the bad guys. It just doesn't make sense, it's not a human story and you can't relate to the characters at all. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's just painfully generic and boring. Nothing standout about this show, but it seems to be quite popular. Can't even say there was effort put into this because it's horribly cookie-cutter and generic.",

Threw me an almost infinite number loops. Main characters have absolutely amazing backstories. The antagonist is so ridiculously cruel that I wish he was real so we could drop a nuke on him. (And for somebody who doesn't even exist to get me this riled up is a feat in itself.) The art is glorious. The sound is flawless, and the one mistake I could find was so miniscule that it couldn't detract from theoverall score I gave it if it wanted to. Overall, this site's scoring system is too weak to be accurate. I would have given it an infinity/10, but that couldn't be done. Simply sublime.\\n\r\nRokuro is my favorite character, followed closely by Benio, then Kinako, Mayura, Seigen, Ryogo, and so-on-so-forth. Watch. Read. Just see this serie, okay? Good, 'cause I'm outta here!",

            "content": "Okay, it should be noted that I went into this anime from being a reader of the manga, so my view may be a little skewed.\r\nNow for the good points:\r\nThe art is actually pretty good, and the sounds are enjoyable,  it has good music and over all decent voice acting, though I find it irritating that the CHILDREN sound like adults. It is annoying the fact that they aren't made to sound a little more immature and kiddie.\r\nNow the bad:\r\n-Most of the story seems to be filler.\r\n-They added too many original characters and moved in characters shown later in the series much earlier aswell.\\n\\n\r\n-They keep on showing the names of the attacks which added to some of the many spaces in the series just seem to add a few minutes to each episode, and it happening in 12 episodes, it's like they added a whole episode of wasted space (and not counting filler plot).\\n\\n\r\n-They focused a lot on stuff that didn't need too much focus and rushed through many of the important points and there were tons of needless filler adventure that didn't seem necessary to the story.\\n\\n\r\n-The characters don't actually seem as interesting in this as in the manga. The manga was actually MORE fast paced than the anime (which is strange).\\n\\n\r\n-Also, I disliked how they showed a lot more focus on the childhood friend's crush on the MC, it was kinda a down turn. In the manga, she was implied to have feelings, but it wasn't directly shown.\\n\\n\r\nAll-in-all:\\n\r\nThe story feels pretty dragged out, it isn't that great of an adaption with needless filler and gaps and adding characters that were obvious mascots (which wouldn't be much of a problem if they made it more important to the story, and also made the story more interesting).\\n\\n\r\nOnly the art and good music were able to make me not completely abandon this.\\n\\n\r\nThe story and characters were poor, and the enjoyment was made even worse because I kept on comparing it to the original source.\\n\\n\r\nI cannot recommend this anime to people.

            "content": "So to begin im giving way too high scores. But i tell you why. The story is nothing too special and most overused premise \"KILL ALL THE TITANS, GHOULS, what ever owair no sepha has\". The characters at first are basic and nothing special. But the arc types of the characters are pretty good and enjoyable. But im going to judge them more of their manga counter-parts. And if the anime follows the manga character growth will be huge and the character may not be the most original but they become great characters in a arc type not used often and done to great affect.\r\nAnothersaving grace(Sill not enough for the amount of points i given out but im a nice guy.) It got to be some of the jokes and comedy, well most is not really that funny or new (Hell it falls into the normal hole as other actions.) But when it does make a good joke or a new one its is quite funny.  I have not laugh that hard since OPM and his \"OK\"\\n\r\nOh and one last thing im a sucker for is a cute ship. And this one is really cute and probably the best this season (Super lovers aint far behind tho.) And i like how it develops and is used pretty well along the action. (Which is something lot of these kinds of animes fail at. but this like everything else is coming from the manga. The anime it self as it stands is probably as good as the reviews say 7.1. But if the anime follows the manga their nothing to fear. And the animation will be a huge plus moreso with some huge fights coming up. The animation is probably the only saving grace right now for the anime besides the ship.0 \\n\r\nOverall this review is irreverent to the anime but more like the anime and manga. and yes i know i gave WAY too high marks but i enjoy it this anime a lot and feel bias towards it thanks to the manga and im just a nice person. Hell i gave school days a 7. (Maybe im too nice)",

(Why is it not 10? Except for the \"Demon world\", the other scenes seems to be generic.)\r\nSound: 8.0 - The Opening/Soundtracks/Dubbingthey fit in the Universe/Scene/Characters. (Why is it not 10? Except for the Opening, you can't really remember the soundtrack of the fights.) \\n\\n\r\nStory: 8.0 - If you have patience to wait for the story develop, it's going to reward you.

So I did, and now it's in my top 10 favorite anime. \r\nThere was something very sweet and innocent about this anime. I admit I had tears falling down my face in quite a few places. And I NEVER cry when watching anime. \r\nThe story reminded me a lot of D. Gray-Man. The MC is both the savior and destroyer of the world. The main enemy, Basra, were just like the Noah. But this anime had more heart to it. \r\nEach character had theirown challenges to overcome in order to become a stronger exorcist. Rather than being annoying with all the flashbacks, it helped make the story more immersive.  \\n\r\nUnfortunately, the anime strayed away from the manga in some places. There were a few main characters in the anime that played little to no importance in the manga. and one character doesn't even exist in the manga, but she was one of the reasons I cried. \\n\r\nThe art and sound of the anime were almost stellar. It could just be the site I was using to stream, but there would be times when the voices wouldn't match up with the character's lips moving. Since this was only available in Sub, it wasn't a huge deal for me, but it is still annoying to know about. \\n\r\nOverall I LOVED this anime, and can't wait for season 2!  Oh, one little thing though. If you think they're gonna kiss, then you best hold your breath a bit longer. It took them a long time to have their first kiss, and there may have been a huge battle going on behind them. It just added to the sweetness of their first kiss IMO. \\n\r\n10/10 Would recommend. \\n\r\n10/10 Will watch again. \\n\r\n-JNutt22",

However, this is not the case with this anime. It progresses slowly, but it builds the characters and the world step by step.\r\nIts trying to do a lot. Its trying to be shounen and romance at the same time. It is trying to simultaneously write the heroic journey of two people, and that takes time.\r\nMy advice is that you will enjoy this anime more and more as the show continues to progress, and as the charactersare chiselled out from dull simplistic identities to characters with nuances. Managing to this, i.e. making an anime for the long haul and focusing on slowly fleshing out the relationships is difficult and takes time.\\n\\n\r\nThis reminds me a lot of Steins;Gate. I hated the first 10 episodes. But later on it got so good that I couldn't stop watching. I still haven't watched the whole thing yet, but I sure hope that the anime series continues to improve both its characters and its story line.\\n\\n\r\n8/10.",

            "content": "Yet again, much like with Hundred, here I am just checking to see how many episodes an anime will be this season and am utterly dumbfounded by the low rating the anime has. Hunred was slightly more understandable but THIS? Not TSE!!!! This was my anime of choice...before i started watching Re: Zero. So allow me to be a diamond in the rough, a review for those of you looking at the 3s and 4s overall in the other reviews and saying \"is this anime really that shitty?\" well I can assure you that it is not. Allow me to explain.\r\nThe three main genre forthis anime are Action, Shounen, and Romance (even though MAL doesn't even list it as a romance). These will be analyzed at the end. Now for the other stuff.\\n\\n\r\nStory (9/10):\\n\r\nA lot of people might think it is your typical shounen anime. Main character has a rough past, hates his power, girl comes, changes his mind, now he's a total badass. Well this both is and is not exactly what I described. Are those the main components of the story? Well...yeah. But the anime just pulls of this typical shounen story so well.\\n\\n\r\nRokuro had a legitimate reason to never want to fight again. He was scarred at such a young age, and I honestly felt for him. Then this girl comes along, who is not like our typical strong female in a shounen anime who is basically like \"Go main hero! Fight! Save the day! You are amazing!\" Nah, Benio-sama don't play that shit. Benio-sama gonna fuck shit up and if you wanna join just do not get in her way.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, the story is pulled of really well so far, and there have been some plot twists that I shamefully did not see coming. Lumping this in with all other shounen anime would be a mistake, 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10):\\n\r\nUnless something about art or sound really stands out, do not expect anything other than an 8 out of me. I do not give a flying shit about art or sound. Doesn't make my eyes hurt, 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10):\\n\r\nSame concept. Good voice actors/actresses for what it matters. The little rat dude that Benio has can get annoying, but he shuts up pretty quick. But seriously if you care so much about sound go watch the Sound of Music or something. Bleh, 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (10/10):\\n\r\nOooohhhh boyyyy, probably a really controversial rating. But I honestly love the characters in this anime. Rokuro and Benio fulfill there teenage pseudo-lovestruck roles extremely well and make the anime extremely funny at times. \\n\\n\r\nThe head exorcist guy (although super sketchy, like seriously he's up to something) is interesting and moves their relationship further which is always good. \\n\\n\r\nRokuro's other friend with the bountiful feast of melons is your typical osananaj-Fuck it-childhood friend, who is cute and sweet and cares about Rokuro so much, she's adorable and a great addition to the love triangle. \\n\\n\r\nHonestly the only slight flaw so far is that the anime has introduced some characters then just kind of not done anything with them. But with more episodes that would change, sooooooo I can't fault them for that yet.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the characters are entertaining and fun to watch, 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10):\\n\r\nEvery week I cannot wait to watch TSE. It's one of those anime that makes you want to write a review about it when shithea-oops, I mean respectable MAL reviewers who are allowed to have their own opinions- don't give it the credit it deserves. It's funny, serious at times, and the romance has been good so far.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10):\\n\r\nTime to break it down by genre:\\n\\n\r\nRomance:\\n\r\nThe kids are supposed to be in like 9th grade, so obviously they are inexperienced and shy and adorable. The love triangle between Rokuro, Benio, and Melons is actually pretty legit. Benio is clearly the favorite so far and I think Melons sees her as a legitimate threat to her being with Rokuro, which makes her act even more adorable and ah, it's just so good. And the blushes from Rokuro and Benio, staples of every romance anime, just amazing. \\n\\n\r\nScore: 9/10\\n\r\nComposition: 40% (meaning I think the anime is about 40% romance(\\n\\n\r\nShounen:\\n\r\nYeah...it's pretty damn shounen. But in a really good way. Rokuro is not so overpowered right away that he can one-punch everything (though he can one-punch a lot). And Benio is clearly needed for him to be a totally effective fighter, a trait that not most shounen anime have. I honestly think it is a big upgrade over typical shounen anime like Hundred.\\n\\n\r\nScore: 10/10\\n\r\nComposition: 25%\\n\\n\r\nAction:\\n\r\nI was actually surprised at how little action there is in the series since th first few episodes have quite a bit. However, the middle and later parts focus more on plot development leaving less time for fights. There are still plenty though, don't get me wrong, but the ones that are there are not quite as good as I would have liked and are typically very predictable (as with most shounen anime). But overall the fights keep the anime interesting and are starting to segue nicely into the romance parts...I like romance anime.\\n\\n\r\nScore: 8/10\\n\r\nComposition: 35%\\n\\n\r\nTotal:\\n\r\n(8)(.35)+(9)(.4)+(10)(.25)= 8.85/10, rounded up=9/10\\n\\n\r\nHope this review helped. I am trying to review more anime that I do not think get enough credit, and this certainly fits the bill.\\n\\n",

Can be said, an anime with old story plot and where the story just moves in uni direction.\r\nI initially marked rate 7 based solely on the idea that I didn't get bore while watching the episodes. But if I have to say, how will I rate this series on the basis of plot, story and mysteries i'll give 2 or 3 mark. We've been watching shounen series with same plot stories but with some good turns inthe story. Also there are many shounen with no good twist in series as well.\\n\\n\r\nArt is fair in this series no such good details in scenes, mainly focus on front scene strongly. No deep details of surrounding and such.\\n\\n\r\nSound is good for openings, both opening tracks are good specially second one.\\n\r\nBut all they used for scenes, is the first opening cuts and for some scenes   they used same short music cuts repeatedly. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters can be said draw fairly. Will not say much about characters, they mixed with current plot and decent story well enough.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I do not get bore while watching this series. I don't feel to just increase the speed or don't feel a need for rush to end point, time passed while watching this series fairly.",

            "content": "Sousei no Onmyouji was really high in the expectations in my book, especially since the author of Naruto himself recommended reading the manga. Well, I guess Naruto fans might enjoy it, but I sure as heck DIDN'T.\r\n__________________________________________________________________________\r\nSTORY: 1/10\r\nBehold, the insanely unique story about heroes beating monsters! Yeah. That's it. Oh, I guess there's a parallel world too, because that makes it an absolute must watch!\r\nsarcasm\r\n/\u02c8s\u00e4r\u02cckaz\u0259m/\r\nnoun\r\nthe use of irony to mock or convey contempt.\r\nIn all seriousness, the plot of Sousei no Onmyouji is completely ripped through and through, and I honestly have nothing good to say about it, so I'll make this short: If you havewatched ANY SHONEN EVER, I don't recommend watching this, as the shonen you saw was probably far superior.\\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nART: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nI've actually seen quite a bit of people compliment the series for it's flashy art style, which surprises me. Until I visited a couple online forums, I had thought nothing but 'below average' while watching the show. The animation, I would still say, is below average, the action looking rather bland (and, lets be honest, who cares about what else animation does in a shonen), but I will admit to the art style being better than I had initially thought. The bright colors are rather nice, and it definitely makes the scenes more distinguishable from other series.\\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nSOUND: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is mediocre through and through. Everything is generic, even the opening with it's nice sound, has lost it's affect on me already, and I'm realizing just how little I care about things like the voice acting, sound effects, and soundtrack of the show. There isn't much to compliment, but hey, it could be worse!\\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 1/10\\n\\n\r\nI can't contain myself watching those two...... You have your typical overpowered main character, and the kuudere lead that makes him blush all the time. The characters have absolutely no depth, and the supporting characters aren't really given enough reason to be cared about, even though they have more potential then our lead characters ever did.....\\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nOVERALL: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, unless you're the guy who never gets bored with cliches, I can't recommend this show to you. Sousei no Onmyouji was a pathetic choice for a recommendation Mashimata, though he did recommend the manga, so I won't rant on him to much. Well, at the very least, the anime is not worth your time.",

            "content": "I feel that these 8.5 words describe the entirety of this anime: \r\n\u201cCliche Archetype-filled Exorcist Shounen With Many Crappy Plot Twists\u201d\r\nI have very mixed feelings about this show\u2026\r\n- Sometimes I thought, \u201cOh, this is such a cool kiddy shounen!\u201d\r\n- Sometimes I became angry at how stupid and immature the characters were.\r\n- I often skipped through some of the many slow scenes and flashbacks.\r\n- Sometimes I even said, \u201cWhoa! Didn\u2019t see that coming! Is this really a kids show? wtf?\u201d when some pretty dark things happened\r\n- However, most importantly, by the end I thought to myself \u201cWow, this is pretty fucking bad.\u201d\r\nI honestly thought this showwas going to be pretty average at first (5 out of 10). Then I thought, \u201cOh wow! This is actually pretty good!\u201d from 9 to 37-ish (7/10). However, towards the end the show started pulling both random and shitty plot twists out of its ass, and then shooting them at us like it\u2019s a \u201cshit machine-gun\u201d (2/10)...\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR at the end\\n\\n\r\nStory:(4/10) \\n\r\nThe story mainly follows two cliche and initially overpowered main protagonists named \u201cRokuro\u201d and \u201cBenio\u201d as they overcome many hard trials thereby growing stronger and closer together displaying mild romance. They\u2019re prophesized to be the \u201ctwin stars\u201d or two chosen exorcists that will get married, have a baby, and the baby will be the most powerful exorcist called the \u201cmiko\u201d (basically something like a baby Jesus that will save the world from all of the evil kegare monsters). The evil kegare monsters are sealed in an alternate dimension called \u201cmegano\u201d, where the exorcists must go to fight them. Almost all of the characters are slowly introduced with background stories that are supposed to be tragic, but their backgrounds came across as overly done to the point where it was kind of just stupid-silly after a while. The story emphasizes that Rokuro and Benio both want to get stronger... and they do... At a snail\u2019s rate anyways, but no worries because they often get sudden power ups out of nowhere. Mm~ sudden power ups. My favorite\u2026 (sarcasm)\\n\\n\r\nThe story really doesn\u2019t have any depth, and it certainly isn\u2019t realistic. For example, one of the main antagonists is basically just some psychotic kid with attachment issues. One thing that really pissed me off is that all of the villains kept saying phrases like:\\n\\n\r\n\"I am all powerful! and you are weak!\" \\n\r\n\u201cIt is no use for you to try to win!\u201d\\n\r\n\u201cOh, but it was all part of my master plan!\u201d \\n\r\n\u201cTHIS TOO IS PART OF MY MASTER PLAN!\u201d \\n\r\nand then the shitty plot twist that I mentioned earlier would be another antagonist saying, \\n\r\n\u201cBut your master plan was part of my SUPER master plan ALL ALONG! I have been using you, lesser antagonist, this whole time!\u201d \\n\r\nI often just sat in my chair, apathetic to all of the bullshit that the characters kept pulling out of their asses.\\n\\n\r\nI feel the story\u2019s pace was much too slow, often dwelling much too long on the characterization and development of the twin stars. It wasn\u2019t really exciting, so I didn\u2019t feel like waiting to watch each new episode once a week. I actually ended up binge-watching once every four months. It had its ups and downs. It\u2019s a pretty a pretty bad story overall. Towards the end, we randomly got hit with some pedophile plot twist shit, and I honestly don\u2019t know what the hell to make of this anime anymore. It had its moments, but the story was actually pretty bad overall. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt:(5/10)\\n\r\nThe art in the fight scenes sometimes looks like it\u2019s from a game where they pause and call out the name of their attack with an epic pose before actually doing it. Everything freezes when this happens, so it adds a certain \"style\" to the art.\\n\\n\r\nThe art's okay overall, but I feel that the series would be more appealing if the characters weren't so... bright and cute...? Except there's one thing that gets to me every time... It's Rokuro... There are scenes when his art turns into something out of a horror movie.  The animation is not the best with many still-frames and lack of dramatic camera angles. The art's fine overall.\\n\\n\r\nSound:(8/10) \\n\r\nWhat can I say? They did a pretty good job on the sound. The OST is mainly dubstep, which threw me off at first, but I kind of like it now. The fighting works well, background music fits completely and enhances the setting. Openings and endings are also very fitting. It's actually relatively unique, but it's not special or powerful like something like something Yuki Kajiura or Sawano Hiroyuki would make. Only one OST was memorable for me until episode 27's opening theme. But now that I finished the anime, I actually occasionally catch myself thinking about their OSTs! (I guess 50 episodes of an anime will do that to you).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: (4/10)\\n\r\nThe characters were okay, at best. However, towards the end, they ended up having little to no real depth at all. In general, they\u2019re  pretty much just average characters with nothing much special about them except for Rokuro's shark teeth (main male character). I initially hated both Rokuro and Benio, but, I actually started liking the main characters around episode 14/15 after they unnecessarily spent all of that time developing the twin stars. However, they're basically just kids with sad background stories tasked with saving the world from Kegare. Honestly, they probably could have made this series into about 24 episodes if they skipped the unnecessary development episodes. \\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of side characters with the potential to be interesting, but they all got little to no development. The dynamic between Benio and Rokuro is pretty nice to watch, but there's nothing too special here. Rokuro's starts off as kind of annoying, fiery, not that smart, and overpowered, but the enemies do get much stronger and Rokuro matures quite a bit and actually becomes a pretty cool character. Benio is the typical smart, cool, amazingly strong, but lonely character. She too grows as the series progresses.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (?/10)\\n\r\nThis show\u2026 is hard to describe in terms of enjoyment... At first, it was fun because it reminded me of a cool game (7/10). As it progressed, the initial excitement died down (5/10). It was very predictable up until a certain point, but things started becoming less predictable as it progressed (7/10). Some of the plot twists were cool, but the plot twists towards the end were just plain stupid (2/10).  In fact, I was legitimately shocked by how ridiculous and incoherent it started getting. It's definitely more suited to a younger less mature audience, but there are some aspects of the anime that are unexpectedly dark for a kids show. An older audience may still enjoy it because it's somewhat entertaining (maybe), although you probably won't be able to relate to it much as an older individual. \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR \\n\r\nOverall: (5/10)\\n\r\nThe story progressed too slowly, they took too long to develop the MCs, the characters were too cliche, but the anime wasn\u2019t all that bad and actually had a decent amount of good moments. The show is bearable, but I wouldn\u2019t recommend this anime to you unless you\u2019ve already seen a bunch of the other top shounen out there. So basically, it was pretty bad and I think your time would be better spent elsewhere. \\n\\n\r\n\u201cDo I recommend this to you personally?\u201d\\n\r\nPersonally? Absolutely not. I could never wholeheartedly recommend this anime to anyone. It\u2019s just something I watched to kill time.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, if you like exorcists and shounen anime, are younger than 16, and like slow stories, then maybe you should give it a shot someday. \\n\\n\r\nIf you want realistic and mature characters, then no you should look elsewhere.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, you probably should just look elsewhere unless you\u2019re out of anime to watch. \\n\\n\r\nI strongly recommend that you check out these other similar, but better exorcist/demon-related shounen anime first if you haven\u2019t already:\\n\r\n1. D. Gray Man 9/10 (103 eps) The second season 8/10 (13 eps) came 10 years later \\n\r\n2. Bleach 9/10 (366 eps)\\n\r\n3. Ao no Exorcist 9/10 (37 eps between 2 seasons)\\n\r\n4. Nurarihyon no Mago 9/10  (50 eps between 2 seasons)\\n\r\n5. Shakugan no Shana 8/10 (76 eps between 3 seasons)\\n\\n\r\n(if you agree or enjoyed reading, let me and others know by clicking helpful or commenting on my page~ If you disagree let me know why you disagree so I can do better next time! thanks~)",

            "content": "Dropped after episode 29.\r\nSousei no Onmyouji is Spring 2016 season's average shounen anime with a theme that has already been used many times. It might seem at least a bit nice at first but, it quickly becomes a somewhat repetitive and uninteresting ride. However, the anime has a little special charm of its own and decently developed characters (at least, before the original arc). But, is that enough to call Sousei no Onmyouji a good anime?\r\nStory: 4/10\r\nThe story of Sousei no Onmyouji, isn't something new or very original, as we have already seen lots of anime that center on certain people who possess a specialability (Exorcists) and fight against supernatural enemies (Kegare) in order to protect the world. The problem is not that it uses an overused theme, the anime does have a little charm of its own but, it doesn't manage it in a way that will make it less clich\u00e9. Also, it doesn't give anything interesting enough to get hooked on and you just end up watching a story with almost no impact on you. The story had potential to be much better but, it depended on predictable shounen elements and was pretty much wasted. \\n\r\nThe romance between the two main characters shows a little progression after a few episodes and some of their interactions contribute to it. Although, there are others which are only supposed to be funny but, they end up meaningless and annoying. The humor of the show isn't that funny, most of the jokes fall flat and they even repeat some of them often. The random fan-service that they add from time to time, also, feels out of place and doesn't contribute to any aspect of the anime. \\n\r\nPutting a filler arc after a major time-skip that would have contributed to the development of the main characters and their relationship, wasn't a good idea, either. At the end of episode 20, the main characters decide to live in a different place together for a couple of years in order to become stronger. So, you would expect them to become stronger, more developed as characters and their relationship to actually have progressed a little, right? Unfortunately, due to the arc following the time skip being an anime original, they probably didn't know how to handle the story and characters in a way that will actually make it obvious that two whole years have passed so, everything remained the same and the time-skip didn't even make any sense.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10\\n\r\nAt first, the characters seem as dull and insignificant as the story. Their personalities may still be kind of flat and boring but, their chemistry, interactions and development is what makes things better.\\n\r\nThe protagonist, Rokuro, seems to be a powerful character who doesn't want to return to being an Exorcist, because of a dramatic childhood experience. He is the kind of MC with not much depth, mostly cheerful but, kind of annoying, too, wants to always protect others and become stronger and his actions are all predictable.\\n\r\nThe main female character, Benio, also didn't use to have much to be described with. She was the cool and silent type of character and another powerful Exorcist but, after a few episodes, she showed us a friendlier and more sensitive side of her.\\n\r\nThe two main characters may receive development after a lot of episodes, but it happens in pretty much the same way all the time. Something bad happens, they think they are strong and they can face it, they fail, they get angry and cry, they get overpowered, they win. Then again the same thing from the beginning. It is a positive thing that they received character development but, the way it is done can end up repetitive and not very exciting.\\n\r\nThe chemistry between them has become better. They got to know and care about each other more, each of them wants to protect the other and they feel stronger when they fight together. Their more romantic interactions can sometimes be funny and cute and actually contribute to the development of their relationship but, there are times that they can be pretty meaningless and clich\u00e9.\\n\r\nUnfortunately, despite all the development they managed to get, they remained completely the same after the time-skip, which makes you wonder if it was even necessary.\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast is rather forgettable, most of the characters are just there to fill their role and they receive little to no development, at all.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 5/10\\n\r\nThe art of Sousei no Onmyouji may not the best and most detailed out there, but it's quite satisfying. Although, personally, I'm not really a fan of the art style and the bright colours, but that's a matter of opinion, and it may also be a good point of the anime, because it gives it a somewhat special touch. The biggest problem here is how terrible the animation is most of the time. Scenes that are often reused, the same movement patterns again and again, overusing images with no motion at all and generally, the show is poorly animated. It might be something that you can get used to quite easily, but it is kind of off-putting to watch action scenes without the impact that they should have.\\n\r\nFortunately, as more episodes come out, art and animation seem to become slightly better, although I wish they were at the level of the 2nd OP of the series, only this one was really well done when it comes to animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nThere is not much to say here, as the first OP (\"Valkyrie -Ikusa Otome-\" by Wagakki Band) and ED (\"Eyes\" by Hitomi Kaji) seem to be fine and the OST is decent enough, but they become uninteresting after a while. The second ED (\"Yadoriboshi\" by Itowokashi) wasn't significant either, but the second OP (\"Re:Call\" by i\u2606Ris) was actually quite good and the animation was the best they've used so far. The third OP (\"Sync\" by lol) is rather bland and the first part can feel a little out of place but, the third ED (\"Hide and Seek\" by Girlfriend) is more lively and enjoyable than the other two.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2/10\\n\r\nI don't really think that Sousei no Onmyouji can offer much enjoyment, watching it ended up a chore after a few episodes and the original arc made everything worse.\\n\r\nSousei no Onmyouji has some cool classic shounen moments but, they are not extremely worth watching and there are other anime where they are done better. The humor isn't the strong point of the anime, as most of the jokes fall flat and it gets repetitive after a while. If you like romance in shounen anime, this one offers some but, don't expect too much. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\r\nSousei no Onmyouji falls into a category of anime with a theme which has been used many times by series greater and more amusing. There are many things that could be done about the story, characters and animation to become better but, it ended up as wasted potential. If you don't mind watching another average shounen anime with nothing much to offer to the genre, you can go ahead and give it a try.",

            "content": "The word 'adaptation' for anime has quite a flexible definition.  Most often, the term 'adaptation' means that the production company takes the source material and tries their best to make a carbon copy of the series that they decided to make in animated form.  But at the same time, the word 'adaptation' can mean \"based on\" the original source material, and have their own anime-original plots and endings that contradict what the original series may have entailed.  Twinstar Exorcists, or Sousei no Omnyouji is an example of the latter.  \r\nStory: The world we live in is a place that exists parallelto its antithesis, a place known as Magano.  In it, the negative thoughts of humans merge together and form creatures of corruption and sin known as 'Kegare'.  Kegare feed off of the spirtual power of humans and are destructive creatures that threaten the world we know.  In order to combat this, there are people known as Omnyouji with high spiritual power and battle the Kegare in a never-ending war to save humanity from their power.  To save humanity, the power of the Miko, a being born from the twinstar exorcists must be brought into the world.  Who are the twinstar exorcists?  Some shithead named Rokuro and an equally prissy girl named Benio.  Oh boy...\\n\\n\r\nOmnyouji's story is in short, arduous.  Spanning 50 episodes of content, what we're given as a plot is, in simple terms, a slew of shonen tropes that span from the power of friendship, all the way to wanting to save everybody, and sudden bursts of power because, plot convenience.  Despite being an adaptation of a relatively popular series, Omnyouji doesn't have much to offer.  It becomes painfully easy to see what comes our way, and a lot of what it is boils down to ham-handed philosophies of two opponents fighting each other with fists clenched while shouting each other's names.  Rinse and repeat that process over twenty times over, and you have what roughly equates to the entire show's runtime in a flash.\\n\\n\r\nThe main attributer as to why the show is so devoid of any originality or interesting developments is because, rather than following what the manga had already mapped out for Perriot to adapt, the studio decided to take a different turn and by Episode 20, change the show's path down an anime original path that has no connection to its original source material at all.  This proved to be a very big contributor as to why the show has such big flaws with its story, as the saga we're introduced to turns the show into a display of power as our protagonists \"get stronger\" as more and more opponents get introduced for no other reason than to make the penultimate plot of \"The end of the world is coming\" a reality for the end so that the show would have some form of grand finale.  \\n\\n\r\nAnother problem comes with how I feel as though the show had too much time.  Most often than not, the case of screentime boils down to not having enough time for a series in order to tell the story that was intended.  Many episodes felt like throwaway episodes, as the show would squander its screentime with flashbacks that have already been shown many times over, recaps of what happened in the last ten or so episodes, or would have episodes solely devoted to talking just to fill up the twenty-four minutes that were allotted for the episode.  As such, episodes like this added to the weariness of how Omnyouji displayed itself, making the what was already tedious, even more tedious to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOmnyouji's problems arose when trying to milk what had already been drained dry.  The show doesn't try anything new in the realm of shonen anime, as the roughly twenty five hours it takes to watch this series can be described with just a tropes that almost every shonen anime uses in its plotline.  That, combined with how slow some of the episodes feel, and how predictable everything is, ultimately creates a tiring experience that isn't worth the time or effort to have.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n- All the shonen tropes\\n\r\n- Predictable story\\n\r\n- Many pointless episodes\\n\r\n- Deviation from the source material did not work\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Likewise, characters have the similar problem with being your run of the mill shonen tropes without what seems like little to no thought with how to make them interesting beyond what they're given.\\n\\n\r\nBoth of our main characters, Enmado Rokuro and Adashino Benio start off the series hating each other's guts.  With the series intentionally pairing them up in order to bring the Miko into the world, it's no surprise by what the end result of the series becomes.  The pair of Omnyouji are as expected.  You have the reckless, brash boy who listens to no one and wants to get stronger with his own strength and his own merits, and you have the girl who doesn't like the boy (at the beginning) who also wants to get stronger and basically has the exact same goals that the boy does.  The character progression for the relationship between these two is noticeable and gradual, which is something that I believe that the show does well on.  However, as far as everything else is concerned, that's about where the positives end.  Their goals are nothing special, their progression is somewhat minimal, and the show makes it very hard for them to lose.  They may struggle, but everything turns out extremely ok at the end.  They're boring.  They're boring because the show doesn't even attempt to make their pains and struggles seem minimal when everything just comes to them so easily, and it becomes very hard to care for characters who despite everything, have plot armor so thick that not even someone who is virtually god can't break through it.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as villains go, most if not all can be described as characters who have a single goal that serves as an obstacle that can easily be overcome once given enough episodes.  Become the best, take over the world, destroy humanity; all of these goals have been done over and over again in more interesting ways that have been displayed here.  It doesn't help that the villains spend more time talking than executing their evil plan, or hell, let the protagonist live when they could easily kill them, so they become minor hurdles that the characters have to jump over to continue on with the story.  \\n\\n\r\nSide characters are a wide bunch that, like most long-running shonen series, are either the friends that the main protagonists are fighting for, and are the less than stellar characters of the same kind who will never amount to anything when compared to the feats that the main protagonists have achieved.  They're your standard group of side characters in a shonen series, and there're very few if any noteworthy characters to talk about since they're largely tropes like; the third wheel, the mentor, the annoying mascot, and rivals.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Character development for the protagonists\\n\r\n-  Entire cast feels like a giant soup of tropes\\n\\n\r\nArt: Perriot's art shines as an example of inconsistency and quality issues.  While normally the show has a lot of blunt and bright colors that are less than stellar in quality, the main problem with Omnyouji's art is how consistent the company is with making their scenes.  \\n\\n\r\nWhen the show wants to, the lighting and the shadows can make the scene look good enough to actually look good.  However, when the show doesn't want to, the art looks like a mess of colors combined with clear flaws in the details when it comes to characters' appearance.  Fight scenes in a supposedly action heavy series are mostly characters standing and talking about each of their side and philosophies while not mercilessly beating the crap out of each other.  A one-two punch, a lot of talking, some more punching, a lot more talking, and end the fight.  The fight scenes hardly have any 'fight' in them, so they feel very disengaging and unexciting to watch.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Can look good\\n\r\n- Largely inconsistent\\n\r\n- Minimalistic fight scenes\\n\\n\r\nSound: Omnyouji's soundtracks are not memorable.  Being roughly 4 cours long, the show has 4 pairs of OPs and EDs that help run the show's opening and ending bits to section off each of the four parts that the show's in.  Despite having watched all of the songs in full, none of the tracks stick out to me in my head as something that was both enjoyable or memorable.  So if you ask me, the tracks are not worth your time.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: It's been about a year since I started watching the first episode, and I honestly can't remember the reason why I even started it in the first place.  Coming out of it though, Omnyouji stands as a show that ultimately was a huge waste of time.  Nothing about it made me excited about watching the next episode, and slogging through episode after episode felt like a tiring excavation to find any glint of originality to make me interested in the series.  The shift from the source material certainly didn't help its case, as the random encounters with new anime-original villains didn't do anything but make the series even more difficult to like.  \\n\\n\r\nDid I like this series?\\n\\n\r\nFor me, there's nothing to like.  You can find better examples of everything this show did elsewhere.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this series?\\n\\n\r\nThough I'm tempted to say 'everything', the biggest problem I had was with Benio's shikigami, Kinako.  Kinako's high screechy voice shouting at the top of his lungs was like nails on a chalkboard.  He wasn't cute, was extremely annoying, and became a huge hindrance to the series because his constant shouting and attempts at 'helping' had me in a tizzy on whether or not I should finish the show, or quit halfway.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime?\\n\\n\r\nTo me, Omnyouji is not worth it.  Reusing almost every shonen trope that exists, Omnyouji's adaptation has almost nothing original about it as its largely anime-original plot turns its 50 episode runtime into a bingo game to see if you can get a bingo from all of the tropes that they shove into the series.  Its lack of originality makes it a tiring experience to have, and I for one am thankful that it's over.  Because there is no way I'm ever going to watch a 50 episode on-going series ever again.",

BTW It gets and actual ending, i mean, if this is what we got from TSE im satiesfied(6/10)\\n\\n\r\nAs usual in a seres who is make week by week for  a full year, it might suffer for the inconstanst quiality in the animation, but is fairly consistent trough the whole series. There are moments where you will say, \"this look good\", at other times you will say... \"ahhh ok...\" (6/10)\\n\\n\r\nIm not a musician i cant jugde the OST from that view, but i can say it gets the job done, you'll remember the songs time to time but they will not get stuck in your head or wanna add them to your playlists\\n\r\nExcept the OP and ED, props to all of them, specially the 2nd OP and the 3er ED (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nI think the strongest thing this series are their characters, the series focus a lot in the relatioship between Benio and Rokuro, how in the begening they hate each other to accept their flaws and praise their strengns. \\n\r\nWhile in the other hand they neglet mostly of the support cast, wich are really good, each character of the supporting cast has their own story but only some of them get screentime to develop that, while other doesnt get any at all, but i see this was done to focus in the protagonists (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nMy personal experience was week by week, sometimes i ended really satisfied for what i watched and enjoyed, other times i ended dissapointed BUT with the hope that it would be better the next week.

Benio is cold hearted and non-sociable but on the inside she's sweet kind and caring, you just have to get to know her. while the other MC is hot headed, hot blooded, and annoying but when he is in battle all of that changes you could call it an alter ego, he becomes brave, strong, and serious but it's not just that but his friends mean more to him than anything.\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment is purely and solely on my opinion. the reason i gave it a 10/10 is because i judge every anime i watch on their first episode so if this anime's first episode didn't interest me i wouldn't have watched the rest of the anime and most likely wouldn't have reviewed.\\n\\n\r\nOverall if you don't like cliche's then i would strongly suggest that you don't watch this anime, while as the plot is a cliche the first episode is a cliche in it's self. But you you don't care go ahead, other than that there shouldn't be anything you would be disappointed about unless it's your own opinion about something wrong in the anime.",

The character development is phenomenal. There has actually been a few instances in which I was surprised on the direction and events of the story, and being surprised by such a thing is almost always good. I find myself cringing at the thought of needing to wait a week for each episode. The relationship between the two main characters (Benio and Rokuro) is a gloriously refreshing spin on the commonly used tropeof arranged marriage, and Mayura is THE waifu.\\n\\n\r\n-Posted after watching episode 19.",

            "content": "[Note: I dropped this after thirteen episodes, so you can\u2019t really say I didn\u2019t give it a chance; if this show couldn\u2019t be good after one cour then I don\u2019t expect it to be worth watching the next three.]\r\nStudio Pierrot are the guys using Internet Explorer. It took them almost two years to realize the Naruto manga was over and they can stop doing anime fillers, and now they\u2019re doing this show called Twin Star Exorcists (listed here as Sousei no Onmyouji), an anime that feels like it should\u2019ve been released a good ten years ago. Main character has a rowdy side of his otherwisecasual personality that comes with a tragic backstory, and he wants to be the best at whatever; main heroine is actually good at whatever, pretty attractive but not fanservice-y, hates the MC for whatever reason but you know they\u2019re gonna fuck someday anyway, and they have to fight some stuff. Lots of fighting. Yippee. \\n\\n\r\n\u201cOh boy, this guy\u2019s another elitist who just complains about shows by comparing it to other anime!\u201d Nah, I\u2019m okay with shows being similar; in fact, some of the frontrunners that aired alongside this show are pretty basic and I love them a lot, but they have their reasons for being watchable. Sousei doesn\u2019t do a lot to differentiate itself from the tropes it uses; most of its appeal as an action is merely weighted on its gimmicky combat, which incorporates traditional Japanese elements a bit. \\n\\n\r\n- TRADITIONAL JAPENESE ELEMENTS - *poof*\\n\r\nHYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s every fucking fight. Someone will say an attack, then time will stop so the name of the attack can appear on the screen and the person can yell. Does it look cool? Yes. But just because it looks cool doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s necessary, so after about two instances it gets pretty damn irritating and makes me feel like I\u2019m being looked down upon.\\n\\n\r\nActually, Sousei just seems to look down on its viewers in general. A lot. One of several things is that whenever someone reflects upon something, a terrible-looking flashback will be shown of that event or quote, even if it happened five minutes prior. Even worse is that a character was made exclusively for the anime, whose only purpose is to suck the heroine\u2019s dick. EVERYTHING that\u2019s said by this Victini-looking motherfucker is just to make play up how badass Benio is so that maybe you\u2019ll like her more. \u201cHEY, IMP! (?) YOUR USELESS ASS IS HOLDING BACK BENIO\u2019S AMAZING TALENT!!!\u201d This isn\u2019t complicated writing, Pierrot. Mommy says I\u2019m a big boy now, so I can understand basic human emotions all by my alone.\\n\\n\r\nIf you actually want to know what the story\u2019s about and don\u2019t want to read the synopsis or other \u201cobjective\u201d reviewers, it\u2019s about our world if it had a bunch of creepy, weirdo interdimensional things called \u2018karaage\u2019, which\u2026 do\u2026 bad things. To people. Come to think of it, I don\u2019t remember getting a good explanation of these things. Except that they\u2019re bad. Are they bad? I guess they\u2019re bad\u2026 They look creepy so they must be bad. And then people who aren\u2019t bad perform exorcisms on them; in other words they do action-y stuff in special costumes and use magic with talismen.\\n\\n\r\n- TALISMEN - *poof*\\n\r\nAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH\\n\\n\r\nThat also has something to do with it, I guess.\\n\\n\r\nThe real kick of this story is that the two main characters are being forced to get married, hook up, and have a kid together. Twin Star Exorcists? More like Twin Star SEXorcists!!! AHHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, they need to breed because somehow their kid will inevitably become the Hokag--ehsorry the Miko or whatever. Which is like the best exorcist ever. This kills the karaage. I appreciate that Sousei doesn\u2019t beat around the bush with these two, you know they\u2019re gonna hook up by the end anyway, but now that fanfiction-generating quirk has actual weight to the story. And instead of having the two fuck like wild rabbits, they have a typical but effective dichotomy between liking and hating each other. I\u2019ll admit that I don\u2019t like Rokuro much, but Benio\u2019s cool, and more importantly they have a weird chemistry that makes their relationship fun sometimes.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget about their complicated backstories!\u201d\\n\r\nYeah\u2026 I won\u2019t talk about how corny that is. You can probably find the basics of it on 4chan\u2019s \u201cwrite an anime plot\u201d threads.\\n\\n\r\nThe backstory and villainous reveal could actually considered to be a good part of the series, as it adds a lot of drama and really darkens the story even if it wasn\u2019t all that cheery to begin with, but it plays out in such a typical and over-the-top way that I started to laugh at it instead. But, to be knocked down means you come back stronger, right? So after a grim reveal and crushing defeat comes\u2026 an awkward couple of episodes of the two kids \u201ctraining\u201d by \u201cbonding\u201d together through some weird exercises. Oh. \\n\\n\r\nSince the romance is what makes Shipping no Onmyouji possibly stand out in the crowd, they should make it count, right? \u2026Eh. One, the characters aren\u2019t that interesting to begin with. Two, a lot of it is just\u2026 awkward. Much of it is forced--no, literally, it\u2019s forced by other characters because they want them to fuck immediately so they can have a kid and so the kid can save everyone, and so Benio and Rokuro get thrown into some strange shenanigans that force them to cooperate. Oh boy, I really feel the love in the air! I think putting the two in a nice villa was a good move, but everything else just seemed excessive and annoying. Little of it is about Rokuro and Benio growing as people and getting attached to each other, it\u2019s about them reluctantly playing a shitty game by one of their bosses. I guess down the line this could evolve into a good romance, but I think thirteen episodes is a bit too long of a wait for what should be a major draw to this series.\\n\\n\r\nLast thing I\u2019ll mention before moving on, but there\u2019s a lot of filler in this anime, as could be expected from a fifty-episode series by Pierrot. A lot of episodes have some sort of nonsense going on between Rokuro and Benio, and to make it seem important somehow, the firefox fuckwit mascot character will make an incredibly irritating scream about karaage showing up, so a little bit of action will happen. There\u2019s slow pacing, and in the case of Sousei, there\u2019s just general dicking around.\\n\\n\r\nAlright, now the art. This has potential, I\u2019ll give it that. If this show was brought down to even two cours, this would probably look pretty great. But unfortunately, Pierrot doesn\u2019t want to spend all eighty-nine quadrillionteen yen they made off Osomatsu-san to make the whole product look good. Therefore, faces often look janky and off-model at even the slightest of distances, and what little animation Sousei has is pretty weak. The actual character designs look good, though, with some rather beautiful eyes (to the animator guy saying that eyes take too long to draw nowadays, sorry) and good clothing. Rokuro has some weird shark teeth, but I think it\u2019s okay given his character and design.\\n\\n\r\nStylistically, it\u2019s interesting. The action takes place in another dimension, a very desolate and apocalyptic-looking dimension with a lot of red shading and outlines. The karaage are incredibly off-putting, weird, shadowy monsters that occupy it; altogether it brings about an interesting setting. Unfortunately, the setting is all it can be: a setting, so it doesn\u2019t make the actual fights look great, which is a shame because I quite like the idea of using magic with talismen and shit.\\n\\n\r\nLess ideally, all the flashbacks seem to have been filmed from an iPhone; the aspect ratio becomes more vertical and looks super awkward, and they fill the empty spaces on the sides with some distracting, scratchy graphics. What\u2019s with this weird design? If this was trying to be original, that doesn\u2019t mean it was a good idea either way. And since this is your average shounen, get ready for 25% of the episode to be composed of flashbacks.\\n\\n\r\nThe one notable thing about the sound is the hellish, creepy \u201cvoices\u201d of the karaage. It\u2019s fucking bizarre and I love it. Other than that, everything here\u2019s another mixed bag of mediocre. The OP is by Wagakki Band, another interesting gimmick J-rock band that combines hard rock with traditional Japanese elements.\\n\\n\r\n- TRADITIONAL JAPANEoh i did this meme already.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, if you\u2019re into Japanese music these days, you\u2019ve probably heard of their song, Senbonzakura, which blends these styles really well. Valkyrie, the Sousei OP, is a different story; the song itself sounds decent, but if you took out the traditional instruments then you wouldn\u2019t have much of a difference. Thematically, it\u2019s still a good choice for the show, I guess. The actual OST should\u2019ve taken some notes with Wagakki Band\u2019s ideas by blending traditional and modern sounds; instead it just sounds modern with some shitty electronic music playing in the back of the fights and some softer piano tunes wherever else. \\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend Sousei no Onmyouji? Based off of this first cour, I wouldn\u2019t. There are some good ideas, but nothing\u2019s really getting done here, and saying \u201cit gets better later\u201d doesn\u2019t really prove a point. In the six+ hours it\u2019ll take for Sousei to \u201cget better\u201d you could\u2026 read the manga, which people have apologetically claimed to be a much better experience, and given the amount of filler here I can see that. \\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend Sousei no Onmyouji? ...More like NOsei!!! 0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o\\n\\n\r\nStory - 3/10\\n\r\nArt - 4/10\\n\r\nSound - 3/10\\n\r\nCharacter - 4/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 2/10\\n\r\nShipping - eh/10\\n\r\nOverall - 3/10\\n\r\nFavorite character - Benio\\n\r\nFavorite episode - 13 until they did that stupid fusion attack\\n\r\nRecommendation level - Low",

            "content": "So I see a lot of people give this show negative reviews, usually 4's, but let me tell you, it's worse than that. \r\nThis show is literally the most generic thing ever. It has nothing going for it at all. The characters suck, the romance that's forced on the characters sucks and has no bearing on the series as a whole, the art sucks and the fights are boring, and the story is overdone to all hell. We get it, for no real reason, these two characters gotta make a baby. \r\nSo the two main characters are a tsundere boy and a kuudere girl. Tsundereboy has a tragic past and doesn't want to be an exorcist, but he's not good at anything else. At all. He's horrible at everything but he has the overpowered ability but they even managed to make that boring because he only really uses that one ability and it's just a punch. The kuudere girl is also overpowered, she's smart, she's cute and is better than the boy in every way. They try to give her a personality but the writers just make her do whatever to fit the scene, rather than have her character naturally react to what happens in the scene. Every other character is uninteresting or annoying, especially the girl's pet and the head exorcist guy. \\n\\n\r\nThe art consists mainly of stills in fight scenes and there's nothing interesting about it. It's a very \"anime\" art style that people who don't know much about anime would imagine every show looks like. The colors are kinda interesting sometimes, but not that eye catching. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is literally just, \"you two make a baby that will be ultra strong lol. But we don't wanna. WELL I'LL MAKE YOU BY MAKING YOU DO STUPID STUFF THAT WILL HOPEFULLY MAKE YOU LIKE EACHOTHER\" Anime like this where the story relies on romance, but for whatever reason the romance is actively avoided by the characters really annoy me. For the most part, the two main characters avoid the romance and don't even really talk about or even consider their \"destiny\". They both care about getting rid of the bad guys and protecting their friends, but they won't even consider just making a baby so they could permanently destroy the bad guys. It just doesn't make sense, it's not a human story and you can't relate to the characters at all. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's just painfully generic and boring. Nothing standout about this show, but it seems to be quite popular. Can't even say there was effort put into this because it's horribly cookie-cutter and generic.",

Threw me an almost infinite number loops. Main characters have absolutely amazing backstories. The antagonist is so ridiculously cruel that I wish he was real so we could drop a nuke on him. (And for somebody who doesn't even exist to get me this riled up is a feat in itself.) The art is glorious. The sound is flawless, and the one mistake I could find was so miniscule that it couldn't detract from theoverall score I gave it if it wanted to. Overall, this site's scoring system is too weak to be accurate. I would have given it an infinity/10, but that couldn't be done. Simply sublime.\\n\r\nRokuro is my favorite character, followed closely by Benio, then Kinako, Mayura, Seigen, Ryogo, and so-on-so-forth. Watch. Read. Just see this serie, okay?

It is annoying the fact that they aren't made to sound a little more immature and kiddie.\r\nNow the bad:\r\n-Most of the story seems to be filler.\r\n-They added too many original characters and moved in characters shown later in the series much earlier aswell.\\n\\n\r\n-They keep on showing the names of the attacks which added to some of the many spaces in the series just seem to add a few minutes to each episode, and it happening in 12 episodes, it's like they added a whole episode of wasted space (and not counting filler plot).\\n\\n\r\n-They focused a lot on stuff that didn't need too much focus and rushed through many of the important points and there were tons of needless filler adventure that didn't seem necessary to the story.\\n\\n\r\n-The characters don't actually seem as interesting in this as in the manga. The manga was actually MORE fast paced than the anime (which is strange).\\n\\n\r\n-Also, I disliked how they showed a lot more focus on the childhood friend's crush on the MC, it was kinda a down turn. In the manga, she was implied to have feelings, but it wasn't directly shown.\\n\\n\r\nAll-in-all:\\n\r\nThe story feels pretty dragged out, it isn't that great of an adaption with needless filler and gaps and adding characters that were obvious mascots (which wouldn't be much of a problem if they made it more important to the story, and also made the story more interesting).\\n\\n\r\nOnly the art and good music were able to make me not completely abandon this.\\n\\n\r\nThe story and characters were poor, and the enjoyment was made even worse because I kept on comparing it to the original source.\\n\\n\r\nI cannot recommend this anime to people.

The story is nothing too special and most overused premise \"KILL ALL THE TITANS, GHOULS, what ever owair no sepha has\". The characters at first are basic and nothing special. But the arc types of the characters are pretty good and enjoyable. But im going to judge them more of their manga counter-parts. And if the anime follows the manga character growth will be huge and the character may not be the most original but they become great characters in a arc type not used often and done to great affect.\r\nAnothersaving grace(Sill not enough for the amount of points i given out but im a nice guy.) It got to be some of the jokes and comedy, well most is not really that funny or new (Hell it falls into the normal hole as other actions.) But when it does make a good joke or a new one its is quite funny.  I have not laugh that hard since OPM and his \"OK\"\\n\r\nOh and one last thing im a sucker for is a cute ship. And this one is really cute and probably the best this season (Super lovers aint far behind tho.) And i like how it develops and is used pretty well along the action. (Which is something lot of these kinds of animes fail at. but this like everything else is coming from the manga. The anime it self as it stands is probably as good as the reviews say 7.1. But if the anime follows the manga their nothing to fear. And the animation will be a huge plus moreso with some huge fights coming up. The animation is probably the only saving grace right now for the anime besides the ship.0 \\n\r\nOverall this review is irreverent to the anime but more like the anime and manga. and yes i know i gave WAY too high marks but i enjoy it this anime a lot and feel bias towards it thanks to the manga and im just a nice person. Hell i gave school days a 7. (Maybe im too nice)",

(Why is it not 10? Except for the \"Demon world\", the other scenes seems to be generic.)\r\nSound: 8.0 - The Opening/Soundtracks/Dubbingthey fit in the Universe/Scene/Characters. (Why is it not 10? Except for the Opening, you can't really remember the soundtrack of the fights.) \\n\\n\r\nStory: 8.0 - If you have patience to wait for the story develop, it's going to reward you. It gets really interesting. (Why is not 10? Even if it gets interesting, it somehow feels \"cliche\" it follows the old shounen recipes with it's own pecularities.)",

            "content": "If I'm being 100% honest here, I almost dropped this anime after ep 3. But something told me to keep watching. So I did, and now it's in my top 10 favorite anime. \r\nThere was something very sweet and innocent about this anime. I admit I had tears falling down my face in quite a few places. And I NEVER cry when watching anime. \r\nThe story reminded me a lot of D. Gray-Man. The MC is both the savior and destroyer of the world. The main enemy, Basra, were just like the Noah. But this anime had more heart to it. \r\nEach character had theirown challenges to overcome in order to become a stronger exorcist. Rather than being annoying with all the flashbacks, it helped make the story more immersive.  \\n\r\nUnfortunately, the anime strayed away from the manga in some places. There were a few main characters in the anime that played little to no importance in the manga. and one character doesn't even exist in the manga, but she was one of the reasons I cried. \\n\r\nThe art and sound of the anime were almost stellar. It could just be the site I was using to stream, but there would be times when the voices wouldn't match up with the character's lips moving. Since this was only available in Sub, it wasn't a huge deal for me, but it is still annoying to know about. \\n\r\nOverall I LOVED this anime, and can't wait for season 2!  Oh, one little thing though. If you think they're gonna kiss, then you best hold your breath a bit longer. It took them a long time to have their first kiss, and there may have been a huge battle going on behind them. It just added to the sweetness of their first kiss IMO. \\n\r\n10/10 Would recommend. \\n\r\n10/10 Will watch again. \\n\r\n-JNutt22",

            "content": "I think its rather easy to underestimate this anime. I think the primary reason is because people are expecting a single cour anime that will get things over with. However, this is not the case with this anime. It progresses slowly, but it builds the characters and the world step by step.\r\nIts trying to do a lot. Its trying to be shounen and romance at the same time. It is trying to simultaneously write the heroic journey of two people, and that takes time.\r\nMy advice is that you will enjoy this anime more and more as the show continues to progress, and as the charactersare chiselled out from dull simplistic identities to characters with nuances. Managing to this, i.e. making an anime for the long haul and focusing on slowly fleshing out the relationships is difficult and takes time.\\n\\n\r\nThis reminds me a lot of Steins;Gate. I hated the first 10 episodes. But later on it got so good that I couldn't stop watching. I still haven't watched the whole thing yet, but I sure hope that the anime series continues to improve both its characters and its story line.\\n\\n\r\n8/10.",

            "content": "Yet again, much like with Hundred, here I am just checking to see how many episodes an anime will be this season and am utterly dumbfounded by the low rating the anime has. Hunred was slightly more understandable but THIS? Not TSE!!!! This was my anime of choice...before i started watching Re: Zero. So allow me to be a diamond in the rough, a review for those of you looking at the 3s and 4s overall in the other reviews and saying \"is this anime really that shitty?\" well I can assure you that it is not. Allow me to explain.\r\nThe three main genre forthis anime are Action, Shounen, and Romance (even though MAL doesn't even list it as a romance). These will be analyzed at the end. Now for the other stuff.\\n\\n\r\nStory (9/10):\\n\r\nA lot of people might think it is your typical shounen anime. Main character has a rough past, hates his power, girl comes, changes his mind, now he's a total badass. Well this both is and is not exactly what I described. Are those the main components of the story? Well...yeah. But the anime just pulls of this typical shounen story so well.\\n\\n\r\nRokuro had a legitimate reason to never want to fight again. He was scarred at such a young age, and I honestly felt for him. Then this girl comes along, who is not like our typical strong female in a shounen anime who is basically like \"Go main hero! Fight! Save the day! You are amazing!\" Nah, Benio-sama don't play that shit. Benio-sama gonna fuck shit up and if you wanna join just do not get in her way.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, the story is pulled of really well so far, and there have been some plot twists that I shamefully did not see coming. Lumping this in with all other shounen anime would be a mistake, 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10):\\n\r\nUnless something about art or sound really stands out, do not expect anything other than an 8 out of me. I do not give a flying shit about art or sound. Doesn't make my eyes hurt, 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10):\\n\r\nSame concept. Good voice actors/actresses for what it matters. The little rat dude that Benio has can get annoying, but he shuts up pretty quick. But seriously if you care so much about sound go watch the Sound of Music or something. Bleh, 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (10/10):\\n\r\nOooohhhh boyyyy, probably a really controversial rating. But I honestly love the characters in this anime. Rokuro and Benio fulfill there teenage pseudo-lovestruck roles extremely well and make the anime extremely funny at times. \\n\\n\r\nThe head exorcist guy (although super sketchy, like seriously he's up to something) is interesting and moves their relationship further which is always good. \\n\\n\r\nRokuro's other friend with the bountiful feast of melons is your typical osananaj-Fuck it-childhood friend, who is cute and sweet and cares about Rokuro so much, she's adorable and a great addition to the love triangle. \\n\\n\r\nHonestly the only slight flaw so far is that the anime has introduced some characters then just kind of not done anything with them. But with more episodes that would change, sooooooo I can't fault them for that yet.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the characters are entertaining and fun to watch, 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10):\\n\r\nEvery week I cannot wait to watch TSE. It's one of those anime that makes you want to write a review about it when shithea-oops, I mean respectable MAL reviewers who are allowed to have their own opinions- don't give it the credit it deserves. It's funny, serious at times, and the romance has been good so far.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10):\\n\r\nTime to break it down by genre:\\n\\n\r\nRomance:\\n\r\nThe kids are supposed to be in like 9th grade, so obviously they are inexperienced and shy and adorable. The love triangle between Rokuro, Benio, and Melons is actually pretty legit. Benio is clearly the favorite so far and I think Melons sees her as a legitimate threat to her being with Rokuro, which makes her act even more adorable and ah, it's just so good. And the blushes from Rokuro and Benio, staples of every romance anime, just amazing. \\n\\n\r\nScore: 9/10\\n\r\nComposition: 40% (meaning I think the anime is about 40% romance(\\n\\n\r\nShounen:\\n\r\nYeah...it's pretty damn shounen. But in a really good way. Rokuro is not so overpowered right away that he can one-punch everything (though he can one-punch a lot). And Benio is clearly needed for him to be a totally effective fighter, a trait that not most shounen anime have. I honestly think it is a big upgrade over typical shounen anime like Hundred.\\n\\n\r\nScore: 10/10\\n\r\nComposition: 25%\\n\\n\r\nAction:\\n\r\nI was actually surprised at how little action there is in the series since th first few episodes have quite a bit. However, the middle and later parts focus more on plot development leaving less time for fights. There are still plenty though, don't get me wrong, but the ones that are there are not quite as good as I would have liked and are typically very predictable (as with most shounen anime). But overall the fights keep the anime interesting and are starting to segue nicely into the romance parts...I like romance anime.\\n\\n\r\nScore: 8/10\\n\r\nComposition: 35%\\n\\n\r\nTotal:\\n\r\n(8)(.35)+(9)(.4)+(10)(.25)= 8.85/10, rounded up=9/10\\n\\n\r\nHope this review helped. I am trying to review more anime that I do not think get enough credit, and this certainly fits the bill.\\n\\n",

Can be said, an anime with old story plot and where the story just moves in uni direction.\r\nI initially marked rate 7 based solely on the idea that I didn't get bore while watching the episodes. But if I have to say, how will I rate this series on the basis of plot, story and mysteries i'll give 2 or 3 mark. We've been watching shounen series with same plot stories but with some good turns inthe story. Also there are many shounen with no good twist in series as well.\\n\\n\r\nArt is fair in this series no such good details in scenes, mainly focus on front scene strongly. No deep details of surrounding and such.\\n\\n\r\nSound is good for openings, both opening tracks are good specially second one.\\n\r\nBut all they used for scenes, is the first opening cuts and for some scenes   they used same short music cuts repeatedly. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters can be said draw fairly. Will not say much about characters, they mixed with current plot and decent story well enough.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I do not get bore while watching this series.

As someone who read the manga before watching the anime adaptation, there is only one thing to say: READ THE BLOODY MANGA AND IGNORE THIS ADAPTATION.\r\nI'm not going to review the art, character or even the plot since most of the top rated reviews for the show already do that, and yes the premise is somewhat generic but the manga does it quite well to capture your interest.\r\nThe show suffers from what I like to call the rosario no vampire effect, which is whenthe studio does not follow the manga at all. Both of the shows ARE FULL OF FILLERS. The only episodes where they actually follow the manga are the first two and the rest aren't even canon. It's not even good filler and I'm pretty sure the whole show will be like this.\\n\\n\r\nThe show focuses too much on trying to improve the relationship between the main characters, and turns it into a trashy teenage romcom instead of focusing on the action and shonen parts. The manga doesn't even do this and yet the studio manage to make 10+ episodes of this. I am quite sure that if they did follow the manga then it will be more enjoyable than what you just watched.\\n\\n\r\nTLDR : Watch 2 episodes of the show and if you're somewhat interested then read the manga.",

Unlike traditional stories in which the main role will be the strongest of all or will become the strongest and destroy all evil, this story has a more practical approach.\r\nInteresting story line with nice phase modulations to clear the stress with romance and comedy. If you are the type who likes the slow romance in which the characters gradually fall in love unlike sudden movie like romance you will like this.\r\nThe screenplay keeps the possibility of guessing \u2018what will happen next\u2019 to a minimum. Neatcharacter development and the fights have a more logical approach, unlike some animes in which the hero will suddenly gain power to destroy the enemy.\\n\r\nEnjoyed watching until the recent episodes. \\n",

            "content": "I really don't go out of my way to review anime, but the reviews on this anime are quite harsh to be honest. Like 3, 4, 5. I also agree that this anime wasn't the best but some of these reviews are almost as dumb as the people that write them. \r\nOverall: 8\r\nI gave this anime an 8, since it was interesting to watch. It did get long and somewhat boring to watch at times but it was also quite enjoyable to watch as it was completely unpredictable.  Although you're feeling that extreme lack of explanation, it was quite emotional, to be honest. It'snot a great anime, but its not a bad one. If you feel up for 50 episodes split across a week or two then this anime is worth picking up.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6\\n\r\nIt's alright. A severe lack of explanation but, you can tell where the story is going, and get a gist of it by watching. Of course this isn't done intentionally by the studio, its just you being a smartass. It really feels like, the studio tried to cram an entire series into 50 episodes though. Imagine Fairytail (both seasons) crammed into 50 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nIts not great, but its not bad either. The animation is somewhat interesting. Sometimes I feel as if the studio cut a lot of corners making this anime, with overused scenes and animations. At least nobody looked bad. I can say seigen was pretty badass tho. They did improve a lot while it aired, since the main characters and animations looked somewhat stupid at first, but each time they changed it, it got pretty badass.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nNothing memorable. Lots of re-used ost's but it wasn't bad music.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nThe characters were pretty good in my opinion. Of course the antagonist and all the side characters could use work but again, the main characters weren't bad, in fact I can say they were pretty good. The 12 guardians were annoying but improved as the anime went on. You get the point.\\n\\n\r\nCompared to a lot of the stupid reviews here, I think the main score sums up the anime quite a bit. If anyone gives an anime that wasn't a meme, a 6 then they are actually pretty retarded, should be ignored. It takes some serious time, money, and manpower to create a single anime, whether it be good or bad. Especially one thats 50 episodes long so just because an anime didn't suit your personal taste doesn't mean it's poor show.\\n\\n\r\nAlso if you actually look up the ratings that mal use, decent is BETTER than mediocre. Use percentages and the american grading system if you actually want to find some anime that are good.",

            "content": "TL;DR: At the moment I recommend watching the first 20 episodes that were adapted from the source material, then dropping it for the manga or your next show for non-manga fanboy related reasons. \r\nI'm not going to lie, I'm a little butt hurt about this one. The first 20 episodes were at least an 8 in my book. One of the better Shounen anime I've seen in a little while. I couldn't understand why it had such sub-par reviews. At first I thought it was another World Trigger in the sense that it would take some time to warm up to it, but never getthe chance to really shine because of a lack of support. Twin Star Exorcists is in a different boat. \\n\\n\r\nI'm not a die hard manga fan, at all. As a matter of fact, I hardly read any manga,  but I've watched enough anime to tell when a show has diverged from source material. There is usually a significant drop in progression, consistency, and intrigue involving the plot and characters. This makes it hard to rate overall, and I may wind up adjusting this review after I finish, admittedly forcibly, watching the last half of what appears to be an imminent train wreck.\\n\\n\r\nNow the first 20 episodes weren't perfect or transcendent by any means. The community has every right to expect high quality content and admonish the not so high quality content, but I believe people expecting every show with the slightest bit of promise to turn in to the next Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood have their heads up there arses. I'm nowhere near that picky, and if my defense of World Trigger has yet to clue you in, I am also an uncultured swine who is easily entertained. Sorry, not sorry. \\n\\n\r\nI like the cheesy anime tropes and running gags, even those that have been beaten with a stick repeatedly. Yes, those. Character obsessed with a certain food, mascot character, fan service character, hard-ass character that's really a softy, and I'm probably omitting a few in this series that have also been used ad nauseum. These might be deal breakers to some of you, but they are staples of the Shounen genre in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nI love the gritty side to the story. The deaths, the pain, the suffering are all well presented. I'm a sucker for that sympathetic shock value, and cheap plot twist producing deus ex machina, so much so that I can forgive occasional sub-par writing such as a horribly sudden and forced \"This must be a power of the twin stars\" in place of quality progression. \\n\\n\r\nI liked the dub-steppish BGM, wasn't crazy about the intros and endings despite the fact some of the sounds remind me of some bands I like. Even though it's sung by a female the one intro feels kind of like a cross between Taking Back Sunday and Red Jumpsuit Apparatus. To me at least.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is okay in my book. Nothing breathtaking, but nothing detrimental as well.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not a big fan of Benio's Seiyuu at times. Her voice gets on my nerves occasionally, but it was of a diminutive impact to me. Her character took me a little bit to warm up to and that may have contributed. Rokuro's voice really makes both the comedy and the serious parts work. You got a love-to-hate antagonist and a hard-to-hate-despite-being-a-total-bastard antagonist whom are both excellent 'bad guys'.\\n\\n\r\nBut everything that made this a good watch has disappeared post-haste as of episode 21. I expected a time skip but I didn't expect them to diverge almost completely from the ongoing plot. Instead it's some monster of the week bull shit leading up to a non-canon filler ending. My least favorite of which was a blatant Don Flamingo rip off art-wise. It is seriously like some video game shit. They just rendered him different colors. Its ridiculous that a group of employed individuals thought that was a good idea. Crazier yet, that idea was financed and came to fruition! That's almost as bad as doing a filler arc(s) longer than the canon arc. Naruto didn't even try that shit! Well they may have, they just didn't actually do it. Much like Log Horizon season 2, the series is beginning to feel like a dead waste of time. It's not terrible, for filler at least, it's just such an obvious downgrade of everything it already had going for it.\\n\\n\r\nIt's such a shame that so few series ever get adapted start to finish or accurately. *Sigh* Here's hoping this is a lesson learned for the anime industry. I won't hold my breath.",

It is just a masterpiece. Very good storyline and character development with astonishing fights. Amazing soundtracks, probably the best soundtracks i ever heard in anime 10/10.

            "content": "Made by the same studio who gave us Naruto Fillerppuden, so I wasn't surprised it sucked.\r\n~ Twin Star Exorcists\r\nThe show began airing at around the same time as My Hero Academia, but everyone knows which show turned out to be the better of the two. The show deviates from the manga, which I haven't read, so I don't know if the manga's any good. It's probably better.\r\nThe plot takes place in Japan, which is the only county that exists in that world, seeing as nothing bad ever happens anywhere else, even though Kegare are a global threat. Japan is the only country that exists,cause of plot. Kegare are the monsters that reside in Magano, an alternate world, and are capable of breaking into the human world to abduct and kill humans. It's up to exorcists to take care of them.\\n\\n\r\nThe show's main characters are Enmado Rokuro and Adashino Benio. The plot requires them to eventually get married in order to save the world. They have opposite personalities. One is an idiot, which no shonen anime is complete without, and the other is a kuudere. They are both highly skilled compared to most other exorcists. I wouldn't necessarily call them outstanding characters, but I wouldn't call them particularly bad either. I thought they were fine, but unfortunately, the show has several problems which sadly reflect badly on both of their characters.\\n\\n\r\nWe have the characters who have made it their mission to make sure the Twin Star Exorcists fall in love. Arima Tsuchimikado, the chief exorcist and Subaru, one of the Twelve Heavenly Commanders. It makes sense for them to try to bring the two closer together, because that's the only way for them to unlock their \"special powers\". I guess it was entertaining seeing them pull their schemes.\\n\\n\r\nMayura Otomi is Rokuro's childhood friend with big boobs and the show doesn't shy away from using her as fanservice. Her character is lacking, but the fanservice which revolves around her is always executed in a comedic matter, so I wouldn't call it bad.\\n\\n\r\nKinako is a sentient Shikigami created by Benio and he's so damn annoying. Whenever he appeared or started talking, I couldn't stand it. He respects Benio but hates everyone else, especially Rokuro. He's a character who doesn't appear in the manga and I think it would have been best if they had never made the decision of including such an obnoxiously unlikable character in the first place. I'm guessing they decided to add this dumpster fire of a character because Benio's character isn't very talkative, but if that's what they wanted, then why not just have the audience hear Benio's inner thoughts? Doesn't that make more sense?\\n\\n\r\nI have a serious problem with other exorcists in this show.\\n\\n\r\nRyougo Nagitsuji is another one of Rokuro's childhood friends and is more of an older brother to Rokuro. He's also an exorcist. The show actually tries to do something with him only for him to get abandoned. The show's creators are aware of how lackluster he is, so they tried to give him some development or anything that would make him a better character, but failed miserably. But how did they fail, you might ask? Simple. Studio Pierrot did what they always do when they're out of ideas or if they need to stretch something out. Filler episodes. And they sucked. Each and every single one of them. Early in the show, they introduced an anime exclusive character, whose name I can't remember, cause they didn't give me a reason to remember him. The show tells me that he's a kind person who looks after kids, is an exorcist and is a friend of Ryougo. After he is introduced, the show forgets about him, only to suddenly bring up the fact that he died in order to make Ryougo feel depressed and make the audience feel sorry for him several episodes later . . . Seriously? They didn't even try to show what kind of relationship the two of them had. I didn't feel sorry for him at all. They just randomly shoved him in the show without at least making him a half-decent character. Oh, but don't worry! It all gets better, cause the show gives Ryougo a hot new girlfriend in order to cheer him up! What a great solution! If someone's feeling depressed cause their underdeveloped friend randomly died, then just give them a hot new girlfriend, who also just happens to be underdeveloped! Screw using this as an opportunity to improve Ryougo's character!\\n\\n\r\nThere are other exorcists, a duo, who live with Rokuro, Benio and Ryougo, but the only reason they exist is to fill in the empty space with their non-existent personalities.\\n\\n\r\nAll of the exorcists that I've mentioned so far are weak. Most of the show's exorcists are nothing but cannon fodder. Rokuro, even after giving up on ever becoming an exorcist years ago, is still in pretty good shape and on equal footing with Benio, who's considered to be a prodigy and even saves her. Really?\\n\r\nYou either have to be a prodigy, be born with special powers or use some morally unethical forbidden dark lovecraftian art or whatever the hell this show's sad excuse of a main villain did in order to succeed in this world as an exorcist. Ryougo and the rest of the cannon fodder exorcists are so useless. I have no idea how they've managed to stay alive for so long.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have the exorcists who stand at the top of the exorcist world, the Twelve Heavenly Commanders. I've seen five of them, but I'll only talk about four of them, because the last one isn't worth mentioning. \\n\r\nOne of them has emojis for facial expressions. That's it.\\n\r\nSubaru, the woman who tries to bring Rokuro and Benio closer is an entertaining, but underdeveloped character. At least she could kick ass.\\n\r\nShimon Ikaruga doesn't like Rokuro and that's all I remember about him. He sucked.\\n\\n\r\nSeigen Amawaka. I really hated this guy. He's the former master of Rokuro and Ryougo, so why is Rokuro the only one who's actually useful and knows how to use flashy attacks? While being one of the Twelve Heavenly Commanders, the show didn't even try to convince me that he deserves the position at all. He's a horrible master and when he battles the show's main villain, even after powering up, he's instantly defeated. What? Why?\\n\\n\r\nI didn't like the show's main villain and I thought all of the plot twists involving him were horribly executed and predictable. Also, the main character awakening some hidden special power whenever someone he cares about is in danger is such an annoying cliche. He literally just awakened that power, doesn't have the slightest idea what it is, shouldn't know how to use it, only cares about beating the shit out of the bad guy, because the plot demands him to win.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I actually liked about the show was Kamui. I thought he was interesting and liked that he didn't instantly lose to Rokuro and Benio due to some random power-up. Sadly, he didn't save the show for me. He only made it slightly more bearable to watch. \\n\\n\r\n~ Overall, Twinstar Exorcists sucked due to garbage filler episodes, predictable plot twists, lackluster characters and seriously questionable decisions.",

Other than that, the art was pretty decently made but I still think it could've been better if more time and effort were put into it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nThe soundtracks were typical but fit in. I wish that they had added more variety in the background songs however because sometimes it felt like the music didn't fit in. Again like the art, it's decent but could've been a lot better\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nNow I honestly would've put a 6 if I were harsher, but thinking about the characters they were all quite unique. The 12 guardians were unique and each very different. Of course because of so many characters you would think it could be hectic, but to be very honest it wasn't. The only downside of having so many characters is introducing them made them feel repetitive. The mc's stories were different and felt like Yin and Yang (tiny little spoiler joke). I didn't quite like the mc Roku but he's a unique character all in all. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nI was quite hooked on this anime despite its flaws and ups/downs. The story wasn't that well thought out but it was enough to get your interest. I wanted to finish this anime ever since I started it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nNow I may get some smack for giving this high of a rating, but I admit. This anime was quite bad but also good at the same time. If this had a better team making this anime I'm sure this would be a lot better of an anime, however the way that the mc's and side characters always had a role and eventually winning in the end  felt like a very well made ending. I must say though, Rip Mr. Lion.\\n\\n\r\n~sidenote~\\n\r\nI haven't read the manga, but I hear that it's completely different and in fact I kinda preferred it this way because the way the episodes flowed felt like the changes should've been made.",

            "content": "I promise the spoilers will be trivial and won't reveal the big \"plots\" \r\nRight. This anime... had a stupid amount of potential to be one of the best animes out there but at the end I'm just sitting here going... typical. Nothing stood out. And this pretty much sums up the review but ofcourse, details and reasoning, now's the time to stop reading if you don't want to be spoilt at all but as mentioned, they'll be trivial. \r\nSo the story revolves around 2 protagonists who are exorcists, 14 year old kids with a terrible past and the same goal. Prophesied to be the \"twinstars\" who are expected to marry and give birth to \"miko\" who'll save the world.  Its not unique, for sure, but has potential. \\n\\n\r\nStory: (a 7/10 but because of the ending plot, 5.5/10)\\n\\n\r\nSince I did promise a minimal spoiler review, all I can say is that the pacing was rather moronic, it was fairly slow, character development was present but lacked any depth whatsoever and mainly revolved around the two protagonists, the supporting characters were introduced in a magnificent manner and there were moments I went \"Woah\" that guy is cool and in the end you don't care much about them since they barely had any focus and you don't connect to them they way you'd want to since ofcourse the focus was only on the two characters. Excessive use of flashbacks to attempt to relate to characters. Timeskip had little to no effect on anyone apart from one of the protagonists becoming a bit more disciplined. Apart from that the protagonists have no development in battle and its frustrating to watch this where they are gaining strength at such a stupid slow pace, even after the timeskip they use the same attacks, sure a couple of new ones here and there and stronger versions of their previous attacks.. but urm, their strength was comparable to running with a needle to fight a war, the thing is, they win, being protagonists ofc, their powerspikes, while temperorary come out of nowhere, there's little explanation and its bogus leaving you with a disappointed feeling even tho' the battle itself was amazing. why? Plot. armor. \\n\\n\r\nTl;Dr: They focused only on a handful of characters and the story revolved around them, several plot holes, predictable plot twists and a rather disappointing ending plot made this feel like a let down. \\n\\n\r\nArt (excluding battle scenes, 8/10) Including battles: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art was marvellous, vivid colours, well designed characters, and oh my, the sceneries in this anime were pure eye candy, except when the battle starts, the characters call out their attack, the anime pauses the fight to display the words of the attack the character is carrying out in a \"stylish manner\" its gonna be a hit or miss thing, but apart from that man this anime looked pretty as hell. \\n\\n\r\nSound: (based on music alone: 8/10) based on how they used it? 5/10\\n\\n\r\nDubstep... I initially didn't know what to think of it but damn it got your heart pumping in action scenes, the problem however is when sad scenes were shown, the music didn't match up to it, its not very obvious but easily noticeable. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nShallow. Very shallow. Protagonists had their characters developed with a focus on romance, making the romantic aspect develop quite a bit, apart from that? Hm, Rokuro (the male protagonist) has some development after timeskip. Supporting characters had some focus from time to time but developed little compared to what was possible. Expecially the strongest of the exorcist faction. \\n\r\nAntagonists: They only existed because they were needed. I felt a severe lack of any beliefs or goals on this side. Making the fights seem pointless, it only revolved around one party trying to destroy the world, for no reason. Another party trying to save it. At the end you have an amazing antagonist but man the way they dealt with it was disappointing and naive and made no sense. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI had nothing better to do, I finished watching this in 3 days. It was interesting in some aspects, especially the middle but it seriously falls off in the end. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6.5/10\\n\\n\r\nI'd only recommend this if you have nothing better to do or you only want to watch this with your logical side turned off. Completely. That is the only way to enjoy this anime. \\n\\n\r\nIf you  do like anime with depth to the whys and hows etc.... I'm afraid this one isn;t for you. It is a shounen afterall...",

            "content": "While many of the reviews are harsh for this anime, I'd like to give my perspective. I watch anime that have a heavy romance element. Action with other elements mixed in are great, but romance is my main focus when looking for anime. Yes, the story is similar to many other anime. It felt like a mashup of D. Gray Man, Bleach, Naruto and some others. I get that's why people were not happy about the story portion. I loved it though. The relationship between Benio and Rokuro. The familial sub-story with Sae. The constant separations from Benio to protect her. Her desperation to getback to him. I for one highly recommend the anime and hope they find a way to make a season 2 with them set to become husband and wife while still fighting to balance the world. I loved the story. The art was fantastic. The character development was gradual. And the music was cool. OP 3 was the best. Overall, I hope my review gets anyone new to the series to give it a shot. There are no shortage of below 7 ranked anime out there with a romance element. This is one of the few above that is worth your time.\\n\\n\r\nThanks, Benio and Rokuro for the love.",

            "content": "There were many many things I highly disliked about this anime. But then there were also many things I enjoyed about the anime with encouraged me to give it a high rating anyway. Skip to the bottom for a TL;DR. Warning: I will try to avoid spoilers but there may be some very minor/vague ones throughout.\r\nFirst off, I'm not really a fan of long shows unless I start partway in an watch as they air, and this show I didn't find until after it was over. The pacing was so poor in some parts that I actually started falling asleep during some episodes, which Inever do while watching anime no matter how tired I am. I still don't know what happened to two or three characters because I slept through their episodes and didn't want to rewatch them. But on the other hand, the long story was good because it gave the show more of a chance to flesh out Rokuro and Benio's relationship. But that long time to flesh hit out also meant that their relationship developed very slowly. Every time something is about to happen to advance their relationship, something comes up last second and the actual event that was about to happen is delayed like 5 episodes because they're too busy getting their asses kicked.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of getting their asses kicked, another thing that really bothered me was how throughout the whole show their goal was to get stronger but they seemed to get weaker. They started out powerful enough to be able to kill kegare in one hit, but then to create obstacles for them, super powerful enemies started getting thrown in and by halfway through the show, legitimately every fight scene would consist of them continually getting beaten up (or attacking the enemy but doing no damage) until they ran away to form a new strategy, or pulled a random, absurd, never before mentioned ability out of nowhere and won through some deus ex machina bs. Pulling random abilities out of no where kind of reminds me of SAO.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of things reminding SAO, this show is full of every shounen/fantasy/romance anime cliche you can think of. There is an entire arc that near perfectly mirrors SAO's Yui arc. At least this one actually made me care for the little girl instead of finding her annoying.\\n\\n\r\nThere is actually a lot more I hate about the show which I can continue to rant about, but as you can see from the rating I gave it, my goal with this review is to convince you to watch the show, not drive you away, so now I will turn to the things about the show that I enjoyed.\\n\\n\r\nFirst and foremost, as a closeted hopeless romantic, the thing that won me over the most about this show was the romance. After calling this show a romance twice you must be thinking rn like, \"hey, LAPX, MAL doesn't label this show as a romance, tf are you talking about?\" Yes, the show isn't really a romance anime, calling this a romance would be like calling Romeo & Juliet a romance (a lot of people don't realize R&J is a tragedy, not a romance). I just like to think of it as a romance because love and emotions do play a very important role in the story, especially towards the end. It's kind of similar to SAO's romance, only the show isn't 75+% trash (I know I did give that impression though in the first half of the review lol). The relationships between the characters and their feelings for each other actually seemed believable (or as believable as you can get in a show about two middle school kids being forced to live together for over 2 years) and they changed as the show went on (even the relationships between background characters)\\n\\n\r\nSecond thing I liked was the ending. The story for the ending may have been a little meh (especially with the deus ex machina crap I mentioned earlier) but it was executed well. There was a good balance between seriousness and comedy and it was easy to jump between the moods as needed (as opposed to all the other fight scenes which were either all serious, all comedy, or an awkward combo) and I really felt invested in the climax, despite it being very cliche and sort of meh story wise. But then again, it some of the comedic moments could've been just an awkwardly written scene that I mistook as a joke, but I'm gonna stick with it being on purpose, because I was laughing my head off while still being worried if the heroes would win or not.\\n\\n\r\nThe show has many, many things wrong with it, and the quality was like a roller coaster, but there were also many good parts that were good enough to stick with it and still recommend the show to others.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR\\n\r\nThe show has many cliche tropes and falls flat in many vital areas, but it picked up well enough in other places were as long as you're NOT the kind of viewer who drops out as soon as things get dull, you will enjoy it",

However, the characters and plot twists more than compensate for this. The story begins as most other generic exorcist anime however after a few episodes or so the individuality and uniqueness of this anime really begins to show. The amazing art style complimented by stunning character development and a story which is generic but also something you would've never expected, with a plot progression keeping your eyes glued to the screen 24/7. It may haveit's small kinks here and there such as cliches or the repetitive phrase of \"I want to get stronger\" but I would \\n\r\n definitely recommend this show. Keep in mind, it is crucial you approach this anime with an open mind and will most likely have to watch a few episodes before it begins to get good.",

The art is not mesmerizing if i compare this one with anime nowadays, it's below the average. The fighting scene is 4/10, so fast and not very much action and skill in that scene. Like \"What?! he is doing it again? no new skill? wtf?!\".\r\nThe story is predictable, when i came to the mid series i felt like \"Oh well, this protagonist will not have an\" OP \"power for a while.\" It's not very good and not bad either, sometime it maybe similar to another anime with same genres, but sometimeit can be \"fresh\" you know what i am saying.\\n\\n\r\nThe character is fair enough, i do not really like the tooth from the male main character, the tooth is not normal, i dont know what the meaning behind that, i just dont get it. The main character relationship is very good, it's developing, from the hate to love, i really enjoyed how they put this on.\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this anime to who prefer more to romance, really enjoyed that romance.",

Give your titles to a studio worthy of them. My issues with this anime stem from the very idea that it has no loyalty to the source material. But that only builds on to the terrible pacing, the filler episodes that serve no purpose, the early intro to characters i myself haven't really met.\r\nStory (5)\r\nIn my first review, I said this studio is capable of animating the story...I take backcompletely. They can't even animate the story in order of the events. Not to mention the early introductions hinder the role in the progression of the main cast later down the line. As a Manga reader i can't really tell where and how this will go, which isn't a terrible thing. My problem lies in the simple fact that Studio Clown (refuse to use their name now) can't seem to execute a coherent plot line without botching it in someway...\\n\\n\r\nArt(7)\\n\r\nNothings changed for me. The Art is good, although the animation is lazy. The color scheme gives off a dark yet vibrant look which i don't mind. The character designs are decent, nothing much to say there.\\n\\n\r\nSound(8)\\n\r\nI actually really like the occasional dubstep that plays in the background. The OP is good too. And the voice actors aren't exactly terrible. Good job Clown, you did something right...\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(6)\\n\r\nThe characters are missing depth, and characterization. The little familiar that wasn't even in the manga still serves absolutely no purpose whatsoever. Although it's not so bad since he isn't with Benio the entire time. What upsets me most is the absence a certain Kegare who plays a humongous role in Benio's character arc. Hopefully he'll appear eventually, and save this anime from mediocrity (even though it's already there...)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(4)\\n\r\nDFIA...It just leaves me with this empty feeling. Studio Clown shows again it gives 2 shits about the source material. First it was Bleach, then Naruto, then Tokyo Ghoul. Maybe it's my fault for having even an ounce of hope in this studio...\\n\\n\r\nOverall(5)\\n\r\nI'm gonna cling to the last few episodes in hopes of seeing somethings that might get animated. But this time for sure my hopes are dead and never will come back. If this gets renewed for a 2nd season, i doubt i'll be watching. \\n\r\nFor those of you interested in this anime, don't touch the manga. It's soo good compared to the anime that it will ruin your perception of the series as a whole. Really i wouldn't be surprised if you still hated it xD. If that's the case read the manga...\\n\\n",

What MANY anime fans do not understand is that there is no ORIGINAL ANIME anymore. When time moves forward so does repeats of stories from the past since most ideas have been made so far until new technology or ideas are made. So for all of you hardliners out there complaining about your complaints of unoriginal and fascist ideals, you will never find many originals left since you can findcopies of almost every anime out there now. I enjoyed this anime it had many different anime in it and thats what i love! for ideals to mix to create NEW ideas.. The Music was awesome with the mix of battle scenes, and yes! there was romance and it was slow at the start. Some anime have that for people who enjoy slower genre so if you do not enjoy a slower romance with action do not watch this!  .. Anyhow this anime was awesome and i hope you all enjoyed it as much as i did!! Cannot wait for another idea like this one soon!\\n\\n\r\nStory 9 - It had Great Story was a little slow for action at first but stories start as slow\\n\r\nArt 9 - the art was magnificent\\n\r\nSound 10 - the music like techno and dubstep with the fighting scenes were epic\\n\r\nCharacter 8 - there were a few characters i wished had more screenplay but great nonetheless\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9 - Enjoyed every episode because anime is always enjoyable\\n\r\nOverall 9 - my overall rating was a 9 because of the few characters i wish had more story to them but if they did it would've been a 10.

            "content": "Intro \r\nTwin stars\u2019 exorcist or its official name Sousei no Onmyouji is based off the popular manga of the same name and is a direct adaption of it. At 50 episodes, long this is one of the longer animes that I have seen recently as most animes these days are not as long as they used to be. So far, the longest running animes that I seen since I started watching animes have been at 366 episodes long and Fairy tail to which the number is probably higher but I have yet to finish that one.  At 50 episodes, long Twin suns is aroundjust over two full seasons of 24 episodes each. \\n\\n\r\nTwin star\u2019s exorcist is an action/fantasy anime with some supernatural elements thrown into the mix as well and in this is actually quite similar to the likes of Bleach. As a result of this along with the setting and the characters was one of the reasons that drew me to watch it. \\n\\n\r\nStory and setting \\n\\n\r\nThe main story for Twin star\u2019s exorcists revolves around the adventures of its two main characters Rokuro Enmado and Benio Adashino who are both exorcists whose main job is to protect the world from monsters called Kagare that exist in a parallel world called Magano and exist only to feed on people. To better understand the story a little background information will be needed here. The story for Twin Stars exorcist takes place in modern day Japan much like the age that we currently live in. In this world exists a parallel world where exists monsters called Kagare that are caused and created by the negative emotions and feelings that humans experience and let out in their daily lives. The existence of Magano is a fact that is known to the general population but they themselves do not have the power to deal with it and instead this duty falls to the exorcist union an organisation formed since ages past to fight the Kagare and keep the war from spilling out into the real world. And the main force of this union is the exorcists themselves who are specially trained personal that have been taught how to use various spells and talismans to which they summon weapons and Armour to use against the Kagare and protect the people. \\n\\n\r\nTwin stars\u2019 exorcists main plot line tells the story of two talented exorcists Rokuro and Benio who through an ancient prophesy are destined to meet and marry and them create a child that will become the miko the reincarnation of the founder of the exorcist\u2019s union Abe no seimei who would end the war between the exorcists and the Kagare that had been raging for thousands of years. The development of the bond and relationship that the two develop as they get to know each other as the series goes on forms one of the main elements of the story. \\n\\n\r\nTwin star\u2019s exorcist draws heavily upon the traditional duties of an exorcist which is to exorcise evil spirits and merges this with the fantasy spells and talismans that form an important part of Japanese mythology specifically those relating to Shinto priests and then expanded to include the supernatural. I felt that the anime\u2019s subject topic of the combination of traditional exorcism with fantasy spells and talismans and the supernatural threat of the Kagare was an interesting idea. The decision to have this take place in the modern world and not a fantasy world I felt was a good decision as it allowed the studio to modernize the ancient exorcists into a more modern look. \\n\\n\r\nLike most modern animes Twin star\u2019s exorcist makes use of one overarching storyline that incorporates a number of sub plot lines within it. A problem that most long running anime series have is that due to the large number of episodes that they have sometimes it\u2019s necessary for them to make use of filler story lines which are story lines that are not part of the main plot but are there to hold and entertain viewers until the main plot is put back in. Many long running animes do this including Bleach, Fairy tail and Naruto. Though Twin Stars exorcist is not as long as any of the ones that were mentioned Twin stars does make use of an anime exclusive story arc that was actually quite interesting unlike fillers for other comparable animes. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\\n\r\nRokuro \\n\\n\r\nRokuro voiced by veteran voice actor Natsuki Hanae of Aldnoah zero and Masamune kun\u2019s revenge fame is one of the main characters of the series and one of the main protagonist of the show. A brash and rather headstrong 14-year-old exorcist Rokuro is an orphan who was found by Seigen one of the 12 legendary guardians of the exorcist union and inducted into it when he came of age. Rokuro can be best be described as being impulsive, aggressive and quick to anger and is the kind of person that would always act before he thinks type. Although a capable exorcist despite his young age a personal tragedy that took place in his old dorm that resulted in the deaths of all his friends and left him mentally scarred as a result. In the past Rokuro had vowed to become the best exorcist in Japan and to protect the world against the Kagare but after that incident things changed. \\n\\n\r\nRokuro\u2019s personality changes quite a bit over the series as a result of meeting the series main heroine Benio. In the beginning of the series Rokuro is aggressive, impulsive and quick to anger while at the same time having doubts about his role as an exorcist due to the trauma suffered from the tragic incident in the past. As a result, Rokuro at this point is somewhat reluctant to use his powers. After encountering Benio and after being told of the prophesy that they had both become involved in Rokuro as well as Benio was dismissive of it and indeed his relationship with Benio started off as a bit rocky.\\n\\n\r\n However, as the series went on and their bonds deepened Rokuro\u2019s attitude changed as he become more conscious of the feelings of others, more considerate of the friendships and bonds that he has forged with others and more importantly finding the motivation in which he can use to fight for. As a fight type anime, it\u2019s also important that Rokuro\u2019s abilities in combat reflect his development as a character and in like the bond between him and Benio this gets developed well. At first Rokuro only had a limited number of spells and talismans that he can use but as the series goes on he gets access to more powerful abilities and talismans as his bond with Benio and his relationship with others improve. Foremost among this is the resonance abilities which are abilities that only the twin stars can use which uses the deepness of their bonds as its source of power. Overall I felt that Natsuki Hanae did a pretty good job voicing Rokuro and that his character was developed pretty well both in terms of personality and fighting ability.  \\n\\n\r\nBenio \\n\\n\r\nBenio Adashino voiced by veteran seiyuu and actress Megumi Han is one of the main characters of the series and is the main heroine of the series. A 14-year-old exorcist from the famous Adashino clan that has long provided exorcists to the exorcist\u2019s union Benio is both similar to Rokuro in terms of belief and at the same time markedly different to Rokuro in temperament. Benio is a calm, mature and measured 14-year-old girl from the famous Adashino clan and has a rather serious personality. She takes the life of an exorcist pretty seriously and is actually pretty similar to Rokuro before the events of the dorm affected him. like Rokuro Benio fights to protect the people of the world from the threat of the Kagare and does it with passion and determination. Like Rokuro Benio did not at first believe in the prophesy of the twin star\u2019s exorcist and did not like the idea of being paired with Rokuro as she saw him as being rather brash and not someone that she can get along with easily. However, as the series goes on Benio\u2019s view towards Rokuro changes as though Rokuro can be brash and indeed clueless at times Rokuro had one personality trait that she admires which in this case is his tenacity and his willingness to fight on despite the odds.\\n\\n\r\n Like Rokuro Benio also wrestles with a tragic incident in the past that made her into the person that she is today with her origin though no less horrible than Rokuro\u2019s actually giving her the strength to actually become a better person. As with Rokuro Benio\u2019s personality changes as the series go on. In the beginning Benio was a calm, collected and measured individual that had an icy disposition towards others.  While not intentionally distrustful towards other Benio at this point only believed in the power that she had. However, as the series went on Benio become more open and friendly towards others while also becoming more considerate towards the feelings and opinions of others. She also began to place more trust in others. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of fighting ability Benio\u2019s combat ability also developed as the series went on becoming more powerful as the series goes on. In contrast to Rokuro whose fighting style is more akin to a boxer in that his styles emphasizes on the use of his fist and direct confrontations Benio\u2019s style is markedly different in that she makes use of a highly acrobatic style that takes advantages of her long legs and uses powerful kicks as her main attacks. Overall I felt that the character of Benio was a pretty well designed character that was given great character development both in terms of personality evolution and improvement in fighting ability. I felt that Megumi Han who I heard for the first time in this time actually did a pretty good job portraying the character of Benio.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nMayura \\n\\n\r\nMayura voiced by veteran seiyuu and singer Yuu Serizawa of Parasyte fame is one of the main support characters of the show. The childhood friend of Rokuro and the daughter of Seigen who is one of the 12 guardians of the exorcist union Mayura is a positive, Cheerful and bubbly person that has a kind and caring personality. As childhood friends Mayura is one of the few people that understand Rokuro\u2019s personality and the turmoil that he wrestles with as a result of his past. As a result of this connection and friendship Mayura has deep feelings for Rokuro that manifested before the series started. \\n\\n\r\nAs this series is focused on the bond between Rokuro and Benio and the romantic relationship that the two develop Mayura\u2019s feelings towards Rokuro though obvious towards anyone but him is only made apparent to him later on after his feelings for Benio become more apparent. As a result, her feelings are not made a reality and indeed in the series this aspect is used more as a sort of comic relief for Mayura as she uses it as a form of motivation to help support the relationship between Benio and Rokuro. \\n\\n\r\nAs the daughter of one of the 12 guardians Mayura has large amounts of spell power and after receiving training from both her father and members of the 12 guardians and after inheriting her father\u2019s unique power she becomes quite powerful. Like all characters Mayura\u2019s personality and fighting ability improves as the series goes on with Mayura becoming braver, determined and more willing to put her life on the line to protect others. Her fighting ability while basic at first and comical swiftly gets more powerful as she trains and after gaining her father\u2019s unique power becomes pretty powerful.  In the end, I felt that Mayura was a pretty well designed character that was given good character development and I liked how her combat ability was improved so much over the series. I felt that her seiyuu Yu Serizawa did a pretty good job voicing her. \\n\\n\r\nYuuto \\n\\n\r\nYuuto voiced by veteran voice actor Ayumu Murase of elDLIVE fame is the main villain of the series. A calculating, cruel and manipulating person Yuuto was actually Rokuro\u2019s best friend before the events of the dorm tragedy and was the primary instigator of that tragedy. A ambitious person by nature that cares little about friendship, happiness and indeed the feelings of anyone else but himself Yuuto is a supremely smart and devious person that seeks only to gain power and become the ultimate exorcist. In this Yuuto is perhaps the opposite of just about every character that appears in this series as he only cares about himself and the gaining of power and cares little about the people that he affects in his journey to do so. \\n\\n\r\nPersonality wise Yuuto has two distinct personalities at first but as the series progresses these merge into one overall one that can be best described as scary and deceptive. His first personality that I call his fake nice guy personality is the one that he adapts when he was young and still following the rules. With this personality he is courteous, quiet and intelligent if somewhat detached from other people. This personality\u2019s notable trait is his deceptiveness in that he will use what he learned from others to twist the rewards that they want in order to achieve the ends that he wants and not what they want. The best example of this is the result of the dorm tragedy. Yuuto\u2019s second personality is a development of his first personality that first revealed itself when Rokuro and Benio confronted him for the first time after his first false death. In this personality Yuuto is openly distasteful of both the exorcist order and of Benio and reveals his true nature to both. In this personality Yuuto retains his trademark deviousness but becomes more cruel and manipulative while gaining more cunning and at the same time becoming more arrogant. He is also more open with his desires which in this case is aimed at Rokuro. \\n\\n\r\nA notable trait of this personality is that his desire for Rokuro that he sees as being similar to him is obsessive to the point of being downright creepy. The same can be said of his rather warped sense of love as well. In terms of fighting ability Yuuto\u2019s strength increases as the series goes on as this was intended to be both the main obstacle for the twin stars and as a main villain to beat. In the series like his personalities Yuuto has two distinct fighting styles that he uses as the series goes on. The first is him fighting in human form in which he uses more advanced spells and techniques than normal exorcists do while his second and probably his ultimate form makes use of a larger variety of attacks that seem to be a fusion between the attacks used by exorcists and Kagare. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I felt that Yuuto was a pretty well designed character and that he served as a great villain for the series. In a way Yuuto can be seen as both Rokuro\u2019s nemesis and a dark mirror version of Rokuro if he had given in to his rage. In terms of character development his two personalities I felt were distinct and interesting with the second arguably the best as it built on the first while also adding in new parts that reflected his nature. All in all, I felt that Ayumu Murase did a great job portraying Yuuto.    \\n\\n\r\nSeigen \\n\\n\r\nSeigen voiced by veteran voice actor Junichi Suwabe of fate stay night and Gate fame is one of the main support characters of the show. A powerful exorcist and Rokuro\u2019s former teacher as well as the one that found him Seigen is also a former member of the 12 guardians. A cold, serious and calm person by nature Seigen can be a hard person to get to know and indeed mostly keeps to himself most of the time. However, beneath this hard and unforgiving exterior Seigen actually cares a great deal about his friends, his daughter Mayura and his students as well. It\u2019s always funny when you see Seigen being embarrassed by Mayura who knows what his true personality is like and says out what his feelings are for a matter that he is trying to keep hidden. \\n\\n\r\nAs a former member of the 12 guardians Seigen is a very capable combatant and even after the events that saw his resignation from that august body Seigen\u2019s combat ability is still way above Rokuro and Benio. I felt that Seigen as a character was a good one as he served as the voice of reason and advice for Rokuro and Benio and uses his experience that he has gained over his career to help them both become strong. All in all I felt that Junichi Suwabe did a great job voicing the character of Seigen. \\n\\n\r\nArima \\n\\n\r\nArima voiced by veteran voice actor Daisuke Namikawa of Persona 4 fame is one of the main support characters of the series. Arima is the head of the exorcist union and has the official role of head exorcist. As the overall head of such a large and important organisation that is charged with the heavy responsibility of protecting Japan from the threat of the Kagare you would expect that Arima would be an inspirational, serious and honorable person wouldn\u2019t you. \\n\\n\r\n For the most part this is true in that while Arima can be inspirational at times and serious when it matters his normal personality is rather different. Arima\u2019s normal personality that he projects when there are no crisis\u2019s is that of a rather laid back person that looks relaxed and lets his subordinates take care of matters for him. He also seems to enjoy using humor to deflect the more serious questions that are raised. However, it is when matters become more serious that Arima\u2019s true personality manifests. In this personality Arima is serious, smart and fast thinker able to come up with many different solutions after hearing the problem. This I felt was a great contrast to his normal personality. As the head exorcist Arima is a powerful exorcist able to fight toe to toe with the most powerful of foes but his notable trait is not that of strength but rather of intelligence and foreknowledge in which he uses to outsmart and outmaneuver his foes. All I all I felt that Arima was a pretty well designed character.   \\n\\n\r\n12 guardians \\n\\n\r\nThe 12 guardians are both the most powerful exorcists within the exorcist union and the council and advisers for the head Exorcist. Each of the 12 members inherit the familiars that were created by the founder of the exorcists and derive their powers from it. On the council, the name of these familiars is used as their titles. Each of the 12 guardians is geared and specialized towards a certain style of fighting though all are proficient in combating the Kagare. Throughout the series each member of the 12 guardians are introduced but some are featured more than others due to their connection to the cast. \\n\\n\r\nThe two that were featured the most heavily was Subaru Mitejima who was voiced by veteran seiyuu Miyuki Sawashiro of SAO fame and Shimon Ikaruga that was voiced by veteran voice actor Kaito Ishikawa of Owari no seraph fame. The purpose of these two characters within the plot was to train Rokuro and Benio in not just improving their physical attacks but also their mentality and their motivations to not just be good exorcists but also become the role that they were both destined to become in which in this case is the Twin star\u2019s exorcist. With the exception of Subaru who know Benio beforehand and who also managed to develop a good working relationship with Rokuro Shimon was probably the one that trained them the hardest. Like many exorcists Shinon did not really believe in the prophesy of the Twin stars and also had a rather low opinion of Rokuro when they first met. This was complicated by the fact that Shinon had a rather difficult personality in that he looked down somewhat on Rokuro. However, as the series went on Rokuro and Shimon\u2019s relationship got somewhat better as both were able to understand each other better and eventually they become friends eventually. In terms of support characters after Mayura Subaru is probably one of my favourite characters as she can be equally serious and at the same time equally humorous as she trains and interacts with Benio and Rokuro. I felt that Miyuki Sawashiro did a pretty good job voicing Subaru and that she probably had fun voicing such a fun character.  \\n\\n\r\nSae \\n\\n\r\nSae voiced by new seiyuu Hitomi Sasaki is an original character that was created for the exclusive anime story arc and is the main character within her arc and a guest character in the main plot. A mysterious girl that Rokuro and Benio found during one of their incursions into Magano Sae is a young girl that appears to be 6 to 7 years of age. A positive, cheerful and intelligent girl that also seems to have the ability to not enter Magano but also to have the power to protect not just herself but also people around her from attacks by deflecting them. Sae\u2019s endearing trait is arguably her cuteness and how she is able to stay positive in even the most dire of circumstances. \\n\\n\r\nAs a result, of being the ones that found her Sae regards and see\u2019s Benio and Rokuro as her parents and cheerfully refers to them as Mama and Papa respectively. As a result of the relationship that both Rokuro and Benio establish with Sae from outside appearances it would look like that they are in fact a family and indeed this is what Sae and the pair actually thought as they traveled together during their arc. \\n\\n\r\nThis aspect of the arc I felt was really well done as it formed an emotional attachment to Sae not just for Rokuro and Benio but also for us as the viewers as well. When the time came for her to vanish at the conclusion of the arc it was quite understandable for both Rokuro and Benio to be in tears as they watched Sae who they had already regarded as their daughter to vanish from their very eyes. That conclusion I felt was well done and was pretty emotional for not just Rokuro and Benio but also for me as well. I felt that Hitomi Sasaki really did a great job voicing the character of Sae.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nKuranashi \\n\\n\r\nKuranashi voiced by veteran voice actor Kazuhiko Inoue of Naruto and Naruto shippuden fame is an anime original character that only exists within his own arc. A mysterious Basara and a powerful one at that Kuranashi is different from other Basara in that he is relatively smart and patient and cunning using all of these features to come up with long running and complex plans. Indeed, though his plan was not ultimately his to begin with the complexities of the plan and how it was executed really was a marvel to see as most Basara though powerful in combat have very little in terms of intelligence. In fact, I felt that Kuranashi behaved more like a human than a Kagare. As a Basara Kuranashi is a powerful combatant able to take on normal exorcists easily and even fight the twin stars to a standstill. But it\u2019s in his intelligence that he truly shines. In animes the best villains are usually those that are both powerful in combat and yet have a sharp mind that is able to outsmart his opponents as well. In this Kuranashi fit these criteria perfectly. In his story arc Kuranashi was able to both outfight the twin stars and the 12 guardians in the enactment of his true plan which I was really surprised about. I felt that Kuranashi was a pretty well designed villain in the end and that he was a most capable opponent for the Twin stars in his arc. \\n\\n\r\nArts and animation \\n\\n\r\nArts and animation for the show was fine for the most part. The character designs for each of the characters I felt was pretty well done especially Benio and Subaru who looked both pretty and elegant. The designs of the uniforms that the cast wore were also pretty well done. The environmental designs for the environments that cast battle in were also pretty good with some of them being especially nice. Animation for the most part was fine though some episodes seem have lower quality animation that others though this is in the minority. The fight scenes for the series I felt were pretty well done especially in the fights between Yuuto and Rokuro and between Abe and cast near the end. \\n\\n\r\nMusic \\n\\n\r\nThe series made use of quite a number of opening and ending themes with 4 openings and 7 ending themes being used. But I have to say that my favourite was the second opening theme Re: Call that was sung by idol girl group iRis to which Mayura\u2019s seiyuu Yu Serizawa is a member of and the third ending theme Yadoriboshi. The rest of the openings and ending I felt were also pretty good but the above two were my favourite. \\n\\n\r\nVoice acting \\n\\n\r\nVoice acting for the show I felt was pretty good with Rokuro\u2019s voice actor and Benio\u2019s seiyuu who are Natsuki Hanae and Megumi Han deserving some praise as I felt that they were able to voice their respective characters pretty well. Mayura\u2019s seiyuu Yu Serizawa and Subaru\u2019s seiyuu Miyuki Sawashiro I felt also did a great job voicing their characters and despite being support characters both of their characters were one of my favorites and this is due to the hard work that their seiyuu\u2019s put in. \\n\\n\r\nOverall conclusion \\n\\n\r\nIn overall I felt that Twin star\u2019s exorcist was a pretty well designed anime that had a great overall story, an interesting and emotional sub story arc, a great cast of characters, a capable voice cast an interesting setting and great music. In terms of story the key point of it is undoubtedly the prophesy that two exorcists from opposite ends of japan would be destined to meet and fall in love and from there create the legendary Miko that would put an end to the age-old war that has been raging between the exorcists and the Kagare. However, for this story to actually work and be interesting the key point here is the bond and the relationship that is established between the two that were chosen. In this I felt that the bond and relationship that Benio and Rokuro developed over the series was well thought out and that the gradual deepening of the feelings that the two had for each other was natural and not too rushed. Unlike the likes of SAO where the romance was too fast I felt that the romance here proceeded at a more natural speed which meant that while it took time for the two to develop it we can at least see them becoming slowly closer with one another. This aspect was someone that liked about the series. \\n\\n\r\nThe gradual development of their relationship also had the effect of also improving upon their fighting abilities as some of the twin star\u2019s special abilities cannot be used without them forging a strong enough bond first. This helped ensure that the story progressed at the same pace as their bonds were. The sub story arc I felt was pretty well done and designed with Sae being one of the cutest and most endearing character that I seen for a long time. The image of Sae, Benio and Rokuro as a family and the sadness that they felt as they remembered all the happy memories that they had with her after her vanishment was something that I felt was well designed and really had an emotional impact on me. As stated earlier the show I felt had a great cast of characters both main and support that I felt were well designed. The two main characters Rokuro and Benio I felt were well designed and that they had a personality that really made them both stand out and at the same contrast each other. This also had the effect of also enhancing each other which is especially important as they were supposed to be fighting as a team.\\n\\n\r\n In terms of villains I felt that both Yuuto and Kuranashi as well as the final villain was well designed and emphasized on not just their strength but also in their intelligence and craftiness. Traditional villains in fight animes like this tend to be ones that were just powerful in terms of strength but less in brainpower and it\u2019s nice that this was different. Voice cast and music as stated were excellent and I felt that the setting that this series was based in was also good. The idea of a parallel world where monsters that are created from the negative human emotions that we generate was an interesting idea. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "MY FIRST REVIEW PLEASE DON'T JUDGE ME:\r\nI don't really see why so many people hate the anime. I guess its because they are comparing it too much to the manga. Anyways getting right into it, I'll just highlight what makes this anime good in my opinion. You can skip to the bottom for a super quick summary.\r\nStory: 8\r\nStory is super simple, its the same \"secret organization needs to kill a common enemy\" simple stuff that's been done a million times. HOWEVER, this anime does what practically no action/romance anime ever does. They make the romance aspect of the anime undeniably linked to the action portion.In order for our heroes to beat strong enemies and get stronger themselves they have to get closer together which I have never seen before. I also like how they take a much light-hearted and comedic approach to its story.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nArt is okay, it uses nice bright colors and the animation is nothing special (they do get in a few impressive scenes in though). I have to give a few extra points though for how they like to highlight their attack names when they say them. They literally pause the anime for a few seconds and display the attack name in its original language (Japanese) which I think is pretty cool, other anime might have done this but this is the first time I've seen it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nthe SFX is okay and the voice acting seems natural and believable. The reason why I'm giving sound such a high score is because of its OST. They use dubsteb and electronic pieces for the fight which is absolutely awesome. If you like that kind of genre of music I can't recommend it anymore.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nSimilar to what appealed to me in the story, the romance is a huge aspect of this anime, and the romance actually goes somewhere here (further than a lot of straight romance anime). Our leads Rokuro and Benio are pretty enjoyable to watch as they both have their own shitty pasts that drive them forward, they compliment each other, supporting each other to get over their tragic pasts. I also like the fact that the male mc, Rokuro, was NOT weak in the beginning of the anime unlike a lot of other shounen action series. The supporting casts all have their own unique place in the story and fill out missing members of our heroes' live (parents, brothers, etc.)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nI feel you can have a lot of fun with this anime. Its enjoyable to see Rokuro and Benio interact with each other and the fights are good nicely complimented with its awesome dubsteb and electronic ost. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nWHY YOU SHOULD WATCH (at least give it a try)\\n\r\n- Romance that is deeply tied with its action\\n\r\n- Actually having romance\\n\r\n- Epic dubstep and electronic ost\\n\r\n- Leads who's fighting style and personality nicely complimenting each other\\n\r\n- A more light hearted and comedic shounen action story",

More than once this show has made me squeal  with joy and cry more than I probably should over an anime. \r\nAgain, the initial story is pretty generic. Boy meets girl, they don't like each other, outside forces force them to work together, blah blah blah. HOWEVER, you can't help but fall in love with these characters. \r\nPersonally, this anime sucked me in and made me love every minute ofit. If you like fantasy/action/horribly frustrating romance, this is definitely the anime for you.",

            "content": "Let's Review How Off The Rails This Anime Got: (LIGHT SPOILERS)\r\nPlease note that this portion is part of an old review I made when the series first finished airing. The second half is new.\r\nBy the end of the first part of the filler arc, the story seemed to be just fleshing out stuff that would help explain and wrap up open details from the manga so that they could end solidly.\r\nBy the 2nd part of the filler arc, the anime just completely went off the rails, having completely changed the order of events and having thrown out whole story elements.\r\nBy the end of the animeoriginal content, we have global genocide, eugenics, utopian slavery, the sexual assault of a minor in her sleep (and by proxy, NTR), nihilistic existentialism, and enough foreshadowed fakeouts and twists to make even Shyamalan cringe to death. Well, at least we got some nice use out of Chekov's Gun and saw some of the characters get more screen time than they would have gotten otherwise. \\n\\n\r\nOver all, I give this show a general 7/10, with some of the elements like animation and original plot occasionally dropping down to six, other elements like sound design and visual cues occasionally reaching eight, and the ending was a solid six. Had they ended it the previous episode, I'd have given them a 4 for the ending and a 7 over all. \\n\\n\r\nFeel free to watch it, but I recommend World Trigger over this show. Very similar, but its a sci-fi setting instead, and the anime original content was handled much better and didn't interfere with the plot once the show got back on track. However, the romance element isn't really there (although, one might argue that having no romance is better than having a romance that is somewhat mishandled). \\n\\n\\n\r\nOther recommendations include:\\n\\n\r\n-Utawarerumono: Itsuwari no Kamen \\n\r\n-Ushio to Tora\\n\r\n-Garo: Honoo no Kokuin\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSpecific Issues:\\n\\n\r\n1- Animation.\\n\\n\r\n    The animation never rises above a 7 at its best. Generally, its about 6, but the consistency is really bad, which dampens the impact of the decent and even the nice animation bits, while also making the shitty parts stand out more.\\n\\n\\n\r\n2- Characters.\\n\\n\r\n    This show wants to be a diet Bleach so fucking bad. It somehow manages to have Bleach's character development problems with a cast that's like a fourth of the size. They absolutely waste some of their \"Captains\", and everything goes to shit in the anime original stuff. I'll admit that some of the basara (their Arrancar) were cool and memorable, and the gyaru one kinda grows on you a little if you let her (but she's still an annoying git), but they are mostly wasted potential too. The romance is especially fucked in the head, and by the time you get some legit progress, the anime original content starts. What little they keep from the actual manga is completely bastardized. I will admit that the characters are fairly well designed, if a bit generic. They also have simple and stylish color palettes, and that includes the special effects and special move cut ins (for the most part). \\n\\n\\n\r\n3- Plot.\\n\\n\r\n    The first half? Decent, the manga does it better. The anime original half? BURN IT WITH FIRE.  Let me put it this way: if you get to the part where they suddenly add a bunch of new Basara, a loli, and a talking bus, you have gone TOO FAR and IT'S TIME TO STOP. Save yourself from having whatever enjoyment you've gotten out of the show thus far knocked out of you from forcefully driving past plot holes every fucking episode. Also, fuck the ending. Seriously, FUCK THE ENDING. NO. THAT WAS NOT OKAY! THEY DONE FUCKED IT UP!\\n\\n\\n\r\n4- Sound Design.\\n\\n\r\n    The music is good. It has this really cool japanese aesthetic. Its very aggressive and uses a lot of woodwinds. The first opening is really great, and the second is okay (I personally found it somewhat skippable). Hell, even some of the background OSTs and other tracks are pretty passable. That's not the issue. The issue is how stale it gets outside of combat scenes. It gets repetitive, and occasionally grating. The voice acting can occasionally be a little off, too. I wish they'd 've added a few track remixes, or literally anything to freshen up the music. Also, gyaru cringe. I mean, I came to like her character, and that Basara is one of the few elements I ended up liking from the anime only content, but her VA is intentionally grating and speaks in an obnoxious fashion. They literally have her try to sing death metal. Emphasis on try. And yes, its a running gag. Fucking hell.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nYou may think I hate this show. I don't. It just has some SERIOUS issues. The show shoots itself in the foot repeatedly after the filler arc takes over the narrative. It then tries to pass it all off as intentional and tries to weave in elements from the actual plot to somehow salvage the train wreck at hand, but it doesn't work well. The only stuff they somewhat pulled off was Mayura's arc, but they don't do her justice. Basically, the show would be a solid 7.5 or so without the second half fucking everything up. That being said, the second half does have a few merits (although you really have to try) and the first half is really decent. Seriously, read the manga instead, or only watch the first half of the show. You'll get a lot more enjoyment out of it that way.\\n",

There is also a very brief 2 minutes at the very end of episode 18, they explain where Rokuro got his powers. There are some episodes that are there just for the purpose of padding (episode 14 literally there just for the purpose of padding) and some others are there just to show how some of the 12 guardianbackground and fighting styles (Some of the 12 guardians they have those episodes is instantly forgotten by me).\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt-10/10 Especially in Magano I just love how grainy everything looks in there. The enchantments are good looking all the time. I also love the flashbacks they look so good. Especially with the actual flashback is darker in color, and the old type style of film with lines and scratches in the background of the flashback.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound-10/10 I really love the variation with the sound track You just never get old with the ost (even if they use the same music sometimes). Sometimes you get a Piano, Violin and some Dubstep during battle scenes. Sadly they do use the same Dubstep song over and over.( but I cant care less since its amazing)\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-8/10 I really love the 12 guardians There all so unique in both design and character. My 3 favorites are Kasukami Cordelia, Tsuchimikado Arima, Tatara (even though Tatara says almost nothing just really funny)\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-10/10 Even when I'm writing this review I'm sitting in my chair rocking back and forth waiting for the next episode. I cant get enough\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall-9/10 The pointless fillers when we don't want fillers since we now know we have a limited 50 episodes. and characters arnt fully fledged out as the could.",

            "content": "This one I\u2019ll keep brief. What I liked about this show is it\u2019s co ed, not to a Bleach degree but more so than Naruto. I liked the bonding between Benio and Rokuro, how they had to work hard to understand each other and ultimately work together. I even liked the idea of their arranged marriage. I liked the character designs (more on that in a minute) and most of the character interactions. I liked the action scenes to a point (more on that later). This show worked\u2026\r\nFor about 20 episodes. Then they introduce the 12 most powerful exorcists alive today, without giving any reasonor explanation of how this kegare problem persists if they\u2019re that damn powerful. And if Rokuro and Benio are more powerful than them, why are they needed? Their character designs are suppose to reflect their uniqueness, but part of the appeal of this show in the beginning was the simplicity of the standard exorcist uniform, and the fact they had the same set of skills. Then they travel to Kyoto to battle basara, but they struggle against some, easily defeat others, and simply can\u2019t/don\u2019t defeat others. Then the final arc comes where once again we have a villain so over powered the writers had to have him choose to not simply kill the heroes because then it\u2019s game over. Also the plot twist at the end is so clich\u00e9d and predictable I can\u2019t honestly recommend this show. \\n\r\nOne thing I do want to mention is this apparently isn\u2019t based on a game, video or otherwise. The star logo upon death of kegare and the screen caps of the techniques used got old fast and annoying; I\u2019d rather they yell them out (which they did too). A bonus point for \"Re:Call\" by i\u2606Ris.",

            "content": "After watching the first season of Attack On Titan, this was the second anime I had a look at. It was recommended as popular on Crunchyroll, however I think we need to understand that 'Popular' does not equal 'good'. Was this show good? This anime at best, was average. No offense to people who actually like this show, but here is why I stopped watching the show.\r\n1. Twin Star Exorcists only ran for about 10 volumes of the manga when I started watching the anime. The show was cast to have around 50 episodes. So at some point or another, ideas were eventually going torun out and the people responsible for creating the anime would have to create a second arc. I started watching the second arc, it was painful. There is something extremely annoying and ridiculous about a villain who introduces herself by playing rock music like shes at a concert. This villain was so weird, I honestly forgot her name at this point. With the serious tone that this show was trying to give off, its a bit hard to understand why you would have a kegare introduce herself to the audience by playing rock music. Its like shes in a pantonmine for crying out loud. I mean this show has funny moments and all, but it tries to be so dark and serious at times, I find it hard to understand where the directors actually wanted to go with the shows mood and tone.\\n\\n\r\n2. The inclusion of Kinako was an absolute mistake. Im surprised that I put up with him for about 20 odd episodes. Despite his cute appearance, hes a fucking brat. His attitude put me off most of time, especially whenever he spoke to Rokuro. On top of that, he adds nothing to the story. Kinako is anime exclusive and as far as I can tell, his main purpose is to serve as comic relief. You know like Gimmy and Darry from Gurren Lagann. Except in Gurren Lagaann, Gimmy and Darry actually added to the overarching story during the second act. Kinako is more like a degraded Navi from Ocarina Of Time, but more annoying.\\n\\n\r\n3. The story is very simple and so are its characters for the most part. Its not necesarily a bad thing, but when you have seen people like Rokuro and Benio before in different Tv Shows, you dont really seem to care as much. To its credit, Twin Star Exorcists has two interesting characters. Yuto Ijika because he has a personality that I honestly have never seen in a villain before. He shows his maniacal side more often than any other villains Ive seen. He's no Joker or Hannibal Lecter by any means, but he stood out from the rest of the crowd. Seigen was the only other character I liked because.....he reminded me of Levi from Attack On Titan. But when you can only think of two characters that you enjoyed from a show, there is a definite problem somewhere.\\n\\n\r\nThe music I seem to have an attachment with. Yadoribosi is such a brilliant song to use in the credits and the opening songs used within the first two OPs were absolutley beautiful as well. The sounds of the kegare and all of cartoonish lazer effects work well together\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the art direction goes, its certainly one of the most colorful and cleaner animes I've seen. Though I feel Assasination Classroom is far superior in style and colour compared to Twin Star. Animation isn't really impressive either, they often recycle most of the same moves in later episodes, so nothing really feels fresh. I don't know, maybe it was to save some money so they would stay on budget.\\n\\n\r\nOk look here's what I will say about Twin Star Exorcists. If you feel like you really want to see this show, then go ahead. But I can only recommend up to the 20th Episode, because after that, it goes off the manga. Yes there is a story after the manga, but its honestly not worth it in my opinion. This sort of show has been done better, years prior this",

            "content": "I actually kinda feel weird about Twin Star Exorcists. I'm very glad I didn't write a review at around episode 12, because it would be entirely different than now. I'll explain why below.\r\nStory - The stroy, while unique in a sense that I haven't personally seen it before, is still pretty vanilla. Excorcists go around exorcising Kegare, teenage girl prodigy moves and meets teenage boy prodigy who doesn't want to be an exorcist anymore. Boy mc likes the Girl mc, and there is another girl who is a side character but is best girl. Very cookie cutter imo. Doesn't mean it's not good though, it'sstill a enjoyable story.\\n\\n\r\nArt - Like I say in every review I post, I'm not a stickler for art. That being said this just looked a bit weird for me. Not bad, but in a sense out there. Still nice to look at but something iffy moments for sure.\\n\\n\r\nSound - Honestly sounded great to me, but thats because I fins it hard to mess up sounds lmao. OP 1 & 2 are also very nice.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - Now this is something I was iffy about for around the first 11-12 episodes. I just didn't enjoy the characters and how they played out. Now mind you there probably isn't much of a difference between anything after episode 12, but it just felt like there was. Show also has a girl I really love named Mayura, who is the male mc's childhood friend that also has a crush on him. He obviously just thinks of her as a friend, so you can kinda see the Shounen popping through lmao. Regardless she's a good character and makes things pop a bit.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - Now I'll be blunt. I nearly hated the first 12 epsiodes, mainly because it seems like everything was forced. This show has some dark tones to it to give it life, and I just don't think they were applied correctly early on. The episode that I think for sure made my opinion 180 was episode 16 and 17. They do something else dark but it also messes with the male MC through psychology, which had always been a point here, but this was a newer degree. After that, everything became a tad more serious, and that made me love it for some reason.\\n\\n\r\nGreat show, really improved after the first 10~ episodes. Can't wait to continue watching more. Only actually wrote the review now because it seemed like a good stopping point due to there apparently being a time skip in the next episode.",

            "content": "Sousei no Onmyouji (Twin Star Exorcists) (MID-SEASON REVIEW)\r\nArt/Characters: So there are a few things that are unique to this show (or maybe it\u2019s this genre) that make the art pretty cool. First and foremost, the character designs themselves are nice to look at and the colors surrounding them are great. There are a few weird design choices that were made, and some of them work to the benefit of the show while others are more of a distraction. An example of something good: Seigen\u2019s dark circles under his eyes show that he really struggles to sleep at night. But Rokuro\u2019s teeth are more like arow of shark teeth than human teeth really just gets distracting, because that trait is unique to him. There is a weird change in art style whenever they encounter a Kegare, the art of that beast looks to be more \u201cbrushed\u201d than drawn. The main character themselves are really quite interesting. Rokuro is an exorcist that shows a lot of spunk and a whole lot of passion when it comes to the people he cares about. Benio on the other had is cold and distant, really only focusing on her own ambitions.\\n\\n\r\nMusic/Sound: The music throughout the show is actually pretty good. The battle scenes feel intense and the calm moments are a breather in between the action. The opening track really showcases the show in a way that is enjoyable to watch and nice to listen too. The music that we find in battle scenes specifically is really put together to pull you into the fight as well. The sounds that occur at times are a little distracting, for example when the characters say a certain spell that they want to use, it will appear in Kanji on the screen along with some stinger sounds and then an accompanying scream from Rokuro or Benio. While I am not against this, it made the show feel much older than it was, but then again I am pretty sure it is common for Shounen manga to do this, so an adaptation would really be faithful to the source material.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Rokuro lives in a world and with people who are known as Exorcists. These Exorcists purify monsters (Kegare) that terrorize a parallel world known as Magano. Because of a traumatic past experience Rokuro has no interest in being an exorcist and does his best to avoid the life at all costs. But suddenly when he is saving someone from a Kegare attack; he meets a girl, Benio, who is working hard to become the strongest exorcists in the world. As the two are barely getting to know each other an oracle from the Twelve Guardians (the twelve strongest exorcists ever known) proclaims the pair the Twin Star Exorcists, aka the two destined to marry and birth the strongest exorcist the world has ever seen. The two spend time learning what it means to fight as a pair and how to burst through problems that come along the way including Benio\u2019s family, enemies from Rokuro\u2019s past, and the strongest Kegare that they\u2019ve ever encountered called a Basara.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Reflection: So I was a little skeptical when I chose to start watching this show earlier this year, but I have to say that it does not disappoint. This show has gotten me to feel a lot of things, including; joy, excitement, fear, terror, pity, and even sadness (for an enemy!). I fell that this is one of those shows where you don\u2019t really anticipate much because it sounds like it is going to be just another \u201cunderdog takes the world\u201d which those shows are plentiful and popular, but it is so much more than that. The funny dynamic between two socially awkward teens who are told that because they have been prophesied to be the two most powerful exorcists, they have to get married and conceive a child\u2013This really through me through a loop. While I have found a plot hole here or there, the show really has a great base and I am excited to see where they continue to go with it. Being this is only a mid-series review; I have seen only 25 of the 50 episodes that are supposed to be a part of the series. So if you enjoy action, spells, prophesy, monsters, and a classic Shounen feel, catch up on Sousei no Onmyouji!\\n\\n\r\nOverall Rating: 7.6/10",

            "content": "Okay this is my first review ever on an anime and my English is particularly not good, but I am compelled to write a short review after seeing the top reviews here giving lower rating, than I expected it to be, i.e. after watching the anime.\r\nBasically the anime starts out pretty good and gets you sucked up in the story, but after 20 or so episodes it hits a wall, story becomes predictable and cliche and the story pacing/progression becomes very slow, so much so that it becomes unbearable and one might think to drop this anime. In this aspect it is kinda similar toSteins Gate; if you have watched it you might understand what I mean. But the last few episodes are better than the starting episodes and especially the last two episodes are what you are gonna be watching this anime for. Music is pretty decent and the character development is good, the story does gets predictable and its of your usual exorcist cliche type, still the ending is just too good, which makes up for the clicheness of this anime overall. I recommend this show to any new comers as well as Veterans and I guarantee, you wont be disappointed by this anime. Have a Nice day :)",

            "content": "After finishing Sousei no Onmyouji, I've decided to make an account and write a review on it because while it's not my overall favorite or outstanding, it's a really interesting anime that I would reccomend.\r\nStory: 5/10\r\nThe biggest weakness is by far the story. The development of the story is sluggish and full of honestly boring episodes, and while there are some highlight moments(aka, the big battles), it's not rare to see the in-betweens not getting you excited for the next episode.\r\nAnother flaw in the story is the amount of plot holes and the number of times this show gets you anticipating for nothing. I feltI either had to wait a dozen or two episodes to finally get questions answered about stuff that changed the plot a ton, and when they did answer these questions the show seemed to be nearing its end.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, the ending was pretty strong and left me wanting for more, and the villians were left with good closure except for one, and that one should get a spotlight in a possible season two.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAs it's a battle shounen, art is generally strong here. And this is no exception; battles are gorgeous, the gfx is beautiful and the important romance scenes are on point(With a certain dance exception)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this show are overall pretty solid. I rarely see a main protagonist I actually like, and its hard to pinpoint why I like Rokuro so much; considering he's nothing extraordinary for a shounen. I think it's his relationships with characters like Sae, Seigan and so that makes him much better.\\n\\n\r\nMy favorite character is probably Seigan. Seigan is probably one of my favorite characters from any shounen too. His character design shows an unexpected side of him you can connect as the story goes along, rather than what it may seems from the start. His development as a human from the beginning of his journey to his moments with Maurya fighting to protect Narukami. His motives are similar to the rest of the characters but with a compulsion that makes his much more interesting.\\n\\n\r\nMy least favorite is probably Benio, the main female protagonist. She's not a horrible character; but I just don't like the way she ended up. She starts up as a badass and ends up as somewhat of a crybaby hanging on to Rokuro, as Rokuro is still standing strong. Despite her \"overcoming\" halfway through the show, it doesn't seem to change.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this show. I was annoyed with the story at times, but the symbolism with ordinary objects and characters(both major and minor characters) and the themes made me think more about the plot and the story.\\n\\n\r\nPlus, the OPs. The OPs were all awesome, however the fourth one was probably my favorite. The artwork and animation got you hyped up, the direction brought your attention to spots where you would feel emotional and intruiged, and it brought useful foreshadowing, but it also(annoyingly) brought dumb spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nTheres not much to say besides this show was awesome to watch. If you can move on from the giant holes in the story and the setup of it, and get to know the characters at the Seika Dorm, the Basara, and the Twelve Guardians, you'll fall in love with them(especially maurya)",

            "content": "Most people got pissed at this anime for one reason, that being that it wasn't following the manga steps.\r\nThe manga clearly follows a more dark and action theme as the anime tried to pull of some kind of RomCom crap. \r\nNonetheless the anime was rather enjoying to watch for the first 5~6 episodes but then came the fillers, yes fillers.\r\nThe thing people got angry about and that's why you only see this anime with reviews of 1~5 mostly.\r\nFor those who don't know from episode 7ish to 17 everything, or almost everything was new material. Now i can't say that i'm right because there has obviouslybeen no confirmation of so but the manga is keeping it's releases steady, about one no chapter a month, while the anime is weekly. \\n\r\nYou see if the every episode covered one chapter be fine but it doesn't and for obvious reasons.\\n\r\nAn good and well executed episode can cover from 1~4 chapters of a manga, at least that seems to be the case for most anime with source material like manga, so plainly saying it there is not enough source material to keep making a good and truthful anime episodes hence the reason to put fillers, which in my opinion weren't that bad, in this show.\\n\r\nIf this show had stayed truthful to the manga we would be running out of source material by episode 15 (counting that every episode would cover about 2~3 chapters).\\n\\n\r\nGetting to the actual review:\\n\r\nStory- 7\\n\r\nIn story terms i personally think it's good, about an 8 for me, but to others it should be about 6~7 hence i give it 7 due to the latest episodes getting on par with the source material.\\n\r\nArt- 4\\n\r\nThe is average  for the biggest part, only the opening as good art to be honest, and really lack.\\n\r\nSound- 7\\n\r\nSomething i actually enjoy, excluding openings and endings themes (both openings are good but the ending themes is kinda meh), the OST and tbh i don't know why.\\n\r\ncharacters- 6\\n\r\nThe fillers tried to develop the characters and only made it worse.\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 8\\n\r\nI value enjoyment less than the other four aspects and for me, because i really enjoyed the manga, i really enjoyed this anime so far.\\n\r\nOverall - 6\\n\r\nA average score for an average anime, which has such a good premise but failed to do it right for the some episodes (it's getting ok again don't worry).\\n\\n\r\nThis is as far as my review goes hope you enjoyed.",

            "content": "Contains spoilers.\r\nTo be clear, I'm not an experience critique or can even be considered a critique. However, when I write any reviews at all, it's all based on my enjoyment of the anime and how it feels connected to me.\r\nWhenever, I watch an anime, I do not compare them to their manga counterpart. I view them as a new experience. So, treat my review as a point-of-view from your average anime lover. To me, this is truly a superb romance anime. Do not watch this anime if you are not into slow romantic developments.\r\nWhat really appealed to me about this anime is the generous 50episodes which most animes are lacking these days. It allows a steadily paced character development between the male and female MC, as well as other side characters.\\n\\n\r\nI'm really glad they didn't add in any harem factor into this anime which makes it refreshing. The relationship development between Rokuro and Benio is heartwarming. I love the aspect where they started off hating each other and slowly grew closer from there. Also, not forgetting the character development with other side characters such as Ryougo, Mayura, and Seigen.\\n\\n\r\nTowards the ending, it's nice for them not to forget some of the earlier characters such as Kamui. Also, I'm glad they didn't turned Abe no Seimei into a villain, and it was explained very nicely that Abe no Seimei had no choice but to cleanse the world using the \"forced happiness\" method as he had placed his hope on humanity for the past 1000 years and humanity only turned out to be worst.\\n\\n\r\nIn a way, he is not a villain as he gave humanity another chance after Rokuro and Benio convinced him as they showed him that even his own creation, the Ame-no-Mihashira assisted them to stop the cleansing. The winning point for me is the fact that the anime ends with a very solid relationship between the two MCs (episode 49 & 50 in particular). Unlike most anime these days which wraps up with the MC not having the guts to confess to the person he/she likes, which frustrates me the most.\\n\\n\r\nIt may be true that the story can be predictable or cliche even but I do not see the issue with that as anime/manga these days revolves around the same topic/plots. Sousei no Onmyouji doesn't try to reinvent the wheel. Personally, I see it as an anime with the whole story focusing around the male and female MC relationship development. It's a romance story which was worth the journey.\\n\\n\r\nI am actually rewatching this anime the next day after I was just done with it. It's truly an anime which I've enjoyed very much. I would recommend reading the manga too as the plots are totally different. It's like reading a whole new story.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR:\\n\r\n- Solid and steady relationship/romance build-up between male and female MC.\\n\r\n- Refreshing 50 episodes long to allow steadily paced character development.\\n\r\n- No love-triangle.\\n\r\n- Both MC not airheads, and have the guys to confess.\\n\r\n- Side characters with solid background story.\\n\r\n- Villains with their own unique personalities and objectives.\\n\r\n- Well explained story.\\n\r\n- Solid conclusion. Not your typical anime where MC's relationship is left hanging.",

Something nobody has ever seen before!!!!!!!\r\nDon't watch this anime.\r\nStory: 4/10\r\nThis Storyline is decent but very unoriginal and all the way throughout I kept referencing it to other animes such as Bleach and Blue exorcist. Although this anime is a rip off of many other animes, with the typical \"I want to get stronger\" theme it was interesting to watch. What got on my nerves however was the whole \"I want to get stronger\" but nobody would train them so In my view it didn't looklike they were getting any stronger It just felt like they were being supported by the love of their friends. \\n\\n\r\nArt:8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is crisp, nothing extraordinary, but it is greater than most. I enjoyed the fight scenes they were amazing.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:8/10\\n\r\nI don't know what to say, the sound was great I guess. The OST wasn't amazing except for the Opening number 3 I think. It was amazing very modern and had an amazing bass, like nothing Id heard before in Anime so I had to give it an 8.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:8/10\\n\r\nAll though the story was just a mixture of many mainstream anime's out there, the character development was really good, you get an insight into many of the characters background although I would of liked to see a bit less of Rokuro's child friends from ages ago and more of Seigen's or Mayuras background sigh.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:9/10\\n\r\nAbsolutely loved this anime, and for once loved the anime. I would recommend this anime to anyone who likes Shounen, and that whole \"getting stronger\", for 50 episodes I breezed past, and it left me hanging off my chair for most parts.",

It has way too many Deux Ex Machinas which resolve the plot in implausible ways, and a lot of plot holes.\r\nYes, it's another story about heroes fighting monsters, and a love story to it's core, but it's more than that. It's essence is about the judgment of the human nature and it's cyclical tendencies fordestructive habits.\\n\\n\r\nIt also fails to resolve various conflicts such as when a new character is introduced and, just as it got introduced, it get's forgotten. The characters tend to forget their main objectives of the plot, and fails to resolve a lot of questions which it introduces.\\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________\\n\\n\r\nART: 8.0\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and art style is nothing extraordinary nor does it offer something new, but it's appealing to see and enjoy.\u00b4Using deep contrasts between the Magano world and the Real world, to set a clear mood and differentiate between the two.\\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 7.0\\n\\n\r\nIt's decent and doesn't offer anything new. It offers a combination of electronical music, dubstep and some instrumental. It could have had a much greater potential if used according to the progress and rhythm of the plot.\\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 6.0\\n\\n\r\nHere's where it really gets messy. The main protagonists lack any strength in most episodes. The Twin Stars are supposed to be the ones who make the story progress and resolve the plot's problems, but they lack the power to do so. They rely way too much on supporting characters who, by far, seem more reliable.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters have poor development and some of them are not even significant to the plot.\\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 8.0\\n\\n\r\nWhile it has a lot of cliches, plot holes and a generic story, it still manages to apply classic Hitchcockanian suspense at the end of some episodes, which can hook you up for the next episode.\\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 7.0\\n\\n\r\nHas plot holes, weak characters, decent sound and art, a good premise but weak story development, lacks a consistent rhythm, but it has elements which can somewhat make up for it... barely. Overall it has a quite decent but not so great score.",

            "content": "I believe the Sousei No Onmyouji is by far the best anime I have watched. However, what really stood out was character development, especially between Rokuro and Benio. Even though they repeat how they \"want to get stronger\" it is not taken literally but more figuratively for they want to have a stronger relationship, become mentally stronger and physically stronger. I believe it is really supposed to be symbolic. \r\nArt: I don't think it is supposed to be artistic, I don't think that is what the artists were aiming for but it is still really good. The background/ setting is amazing though, especially Magano.\r\nStory: Thisanime had a really well thought out plot line with dramatic twists and turns that kept the viewers on the edge of their seats. It was really enjoyable to see how everything panned out. I feel it didn't drag and that everything put in the anime was there for a reason. The dialogue is hilarious and broke up the monotony of being serious all the time. I was always laughing my head off. \\n\\n\r\nSound: All the theme songs were really good and matched the story well (especially the #3 song, it is my favourite). The non diegetic music was superb and dramatic, especially in those tense and heart wrenching moments. The sounds that were emitted from Magano as well were creepy and really heightened the scene. \\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime and it is something that I would definitely watch over and over again, which is why I feel it deserves a 10.",

            "content": "First things first. My \"reviews\" system is explained on a blog entry. Which can be found through my profile.\r\n------\r\n#Little prior note.\r\nI had rather conflicted feelings regarding this Anime on every category.\r\n\u2726Story\r\nFirst of all. It's a bit \"different\" from the usual battle shounens. We still get all the shounen tropes but rather blatant, sometimes stupefied and modernized. \r\nWhilst story is rather well wrapped up and put together. Has plenty of \"f u\" moments in a form of \"plot twists\" or \"reveals\". Story is pushed onward and developed. But at the same time I feel that most of the things were just intentionally created in a waythat somehow uses all the shounen tropes but seriously dumbs them up. As well I felt that too many plot points were simply created to screw with the viewer and kill the buzz.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I didn't really enjoy is how \"modernized\" it felt. Although I love onmyouji type of magic or spell circles or runes.. I were rather disappointed in this one. I remember seeing episode 1 when it aired few years ago. I were rather \"oh yeah.. this seems like my type of Anime\", but now that I watched it I simply felt underwhelmed. Although spirit magic was used, and in unique way of having combo power. (twin stars) it still felt rather \"bland\". All the weird awakenings, power ups, reveals and so on as well felt very weak. They didn't give that \"punch\" that this sort of Anime should deliver.\\n\\n\r\nAnd another thing I disliked is rather puppeteered together couple. The whole premise feels as arrange marriage. Hence another story element of this Anime. Romance, which was surprisingly enjoyable by the end. It has some sweet moments and a very heartwarming smile. Although even by the end of the series I still don't ship the main couple, it was nevertheless fairly enjoyable and sweet love story.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum it up. Once again, story is a tad more different, unique and rather nicely put together throughout the whole experience. BUT, aside it not hitting my likes/tastes, it still felt rather blatant and dull and modernized in a not a particularly good ways. As well it suffers some plot point \"screw you\" the viewer and very, VERY oddly explained and uncovered story aspect moments.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Art  & Sound\\n\r\nArt & Animation was colorful, had style, some cool character designs and variations. But some rather derp and odd faces and facial expressions. Most fights were pleasant to look at and even though it had really weird and random bland powerups and such, they were still pretty nice.\\n\\n\r\nMusic... It was good? I guess. I noticed every soundtrack there, which means it's rather present there. But at the same time for the most part I weren't sure I like the soundtrack or not. Some gave off really weird feeling and odd. Not that much of a positive viewpoint though. Also for sure it was rather \"modern\" styled, which again. Not sure I personally liked as much. Openings and Endings were solid enough.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Character\\n\r\nFirst the good. Development, progression was rather nice.\\n\\n\r\nNow the not so good. Again, rather obvious stereotypes with modern touch to them. Which is simply not a pleasant mix. Not fan of \"modernity\", got enough of that in western media. Anyhow, we get plenty of characters, some really interesting ones, some useless ones, some annoying ones. Also plenty of couples and ships to ship. But I still like Mayura (female support) the most and ship her with Rokuro. (male lead)\\n\\n\r\nBenio (the female lead) did annoy me at the start rather fair bit. And even by the end I weren't particularly her fan, but I grew to like her. I did like a lot when she spoke with soothing voice and her real smiles.\\n\\n\r\nAnyhow, fair enough. Plenty of issues and taste mismatches. But in the end, it's acceptable.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Enjoyment & Overall\\n\r\nSome aspects I forgot to mention and can't be bothered to. But to sum it up. It's \"modernized\" battle shounen romance that seriously lacks a punch and has rarther a lot of \"oddity\" to it in more of a negative spotlight.",

It can't decide if it's about exorcism, if it's love comedy, or if it's something like... well, let me tell you straight - it's shit. Your brain will start to hurt when you watch this.\r\nCharacters are not even 1-dimensional. The writing is getting off-track every second, suddenly anime tries to be serious like hell and than it goes back to being stupid as hell. There's no middle ground. I won't talk much 'cause spoilers but, I just wanna fucking murder every character there. \r\nEven if it was a love-comedy, there's no love, there's no comedy. \r\nEven if itwas fighting anime, there's no fighting, the training is just so stupid it makes you wanna slam your head against the wall. \\n\\n\r\nIt has 0 value. There is literally nothing to watch this show for. It's damn hard to make something like this, usually when anime gets this bad, it's so bad it's actually good.

            "content": "This anime came to excite me in a few moments, I really got to be euphoric with him, wanting to watch 3, 4 or even 5 episodes in a row but I do not even remember why. The reason is simple: the development of the story was disappointing. The anime has nothing special, except the relationship between the protagonists Benio and Rokuro, which in fact is something that I had not yet seen in other anime. No more is a shonen like any other, without differentiated elements, with a complex history on the one hand and confused on the other. There is no notable character,the relationship between Benio and Rokuro is remarkable but neither Benio nor Rokuro are remarkable, characters like they have the hills around and much more interesting. The exploration of the history of the universe of the anime itself and of the characters is flawed, there are several characters placed as powerful but have no relevance as to its history, that is, are strong, just that, neither their stories nor their personalities enchant, in fact no character comes to enchant. Not to mention that it has several characters scrotal and in scrotal costumes and with a way to be well scrotal. As for the development of the history of history is the biggest failure of the anime. For the anime was nothing special, but it is still useful for those who, like me, enjoyed anime of the genre. Not having anything special the anime should do the simple and develop the story in the simplest way possible, which was how I imagined it would be and how it looked like it would be. At the end of the day there were only disappointments left. The episodes passed and Rokuro, who in the early episodes seemed to have absurd potential seemed to weaken or did not seem to evolve as expected. At various times he could not win hollows, ops, kegares, simple. From then on a captain, ops, general to save him and Benio. Benio at first did not seem to be as powerful as Rokuro and it was not, and in the course of history neither Rokuro who seemed to be powerful, proved to be powerful. They were too weak protagonists, how much power, how much personality were reasonable and how much protagonism in history they left to be desired, I never saw an anime in which the protagonists in most moments did not lead the main battles, it was ridiculous. The fight between Benio and Kamui was certain that it would happen that it would be really cool and happened really ... just not. And to finish: neither Benio nor Rokuro nor Benio next to Rokuro were able to beat Yuto in the last battle of the anime and Rokuro was able to stop it. There was no hint that this could happen, because it was the big flaw of the anime: as for the evolution of the protagonists. In the end it was a very bad anime, it was supposed to be good, I would give a grade 1 but it was good a few moments so I thought of giving 2 but then I remembered again the moments that I was excited about the anime and got the fact that I watched all his episodes, even 50 episodes, so I closed with note 3. But in fact I should give a note 0, because all the analysis of the anime I did I would delete all just to say that this anime is a brazen plagiarism of Bleach. Including several elements of the anime, several characters are the same way of Bleach. Hence for being plagiarized the anime would lose another 3 dots and would have 0, because I gave only 3 dots to it.\\n\r\nhad\\n\r\nTradu\u00e7\u00f5es de have\\n\r\nVerboFrequ\u00eancia\\n\r\nter\\n\r\nhave, take, possess, own, receive, enjoy\\n\r\npossuir\\n\r\nhave, own, possess, hold, keep, receive\\n\r\nhaver\\n\r\nbe, have\\n\r\nmandar\\n\r\nsend, have, order, tell, boss, enjoin\\n\r\nreceber\\n\r\nreceive, get, welcome, have, accept, collect\\n\r\nter de\\n\r\nhave, must, be, need, get\\n\r\nproduzir\\n\r\nproduce, yield, make, generate, have, manufacture\\n\r\nmanter\\n\r\nkeep, maintain, hold, retain, sustain, preserve\\n\r\ndeixar\\n\r\nleave, let, quit, have, let go, go\\n\r\nsofrer\\n\r\nsuffer, undergo, experience, have, endure, bear\\n\r\nalcan\u00e7ar\\n\r\nachieve, reach, attain, obtain, catch up, gain\\n\r\nsaber\\n\r\nknow, have, savvy\\n\r\n10 outras tradu\u00e7\u00f5es\\n\r\nDefini\u00e7\u00f5es de have\\n\r\nVerbo\\n\r\n1\\n\r\npossess, own, or hold.\\n\r\nhe had a new car and a boat\\n\r\nSin\u00f4nimos:\\n\r\npossess own be in possession of be the owner of be blessed with boast enjoy keep retain hold occupy\\n\r\n2\\n\r\nexperience; undergo.\\n\r\nI went to a few parties and had a good time\\n\r\nSin\u00f4nimos:\\n\r\nexperience encounter face meet find run into go through undergo experience enjoy\\n\r\n3\\n\r\nbe obliged or find it necessary to do the specified thing.\\n\r\nyou don't have to accept this situation\\n\r\nSin\u00f4nimos:\\n\r\nmust be obliged to be required to be compelled to be forced to be bound to\\n\r\n+5 defini\u00e7\u00f5es\\n\r\nSin\u00f4nimos de have\\n\r\nVerbo\\n\r\npossess comprise eat receive organize give birth to entertain experience be suffering from harbor manifest make tolerate must trick stimulate own accept give birth ingest take feature get have got give.",

            "content": "This is a review of episodes 1-9! It may get updated later as the episodes come out! Unless I drop it by then...\r\nI just want to start out by saying this: this anime is not bad, just nothing special!\r\nWith that said, this is the perfect anime for people who haven't watched much anime, especially within the action/romance genre. It's a pretty good gateway into it, but if you've seen ANY standard action/romance anime you've seen this anime. \r\nStory/character: I decided to put these two together since I feel the same way about them: they're cliche and pretty boring. It doesn't try to do anything uniqueand stands by a checklist of everything that makes a standard action anime. It doesn't step out of that safe box, and that's disappointing. Not bad, just nothing more than cliche. Rokuro is a standard delinquent MC who is seriously way too overpowered, Benio is the \"badass\" way to proud girl who is supposed to be strong, but the moment MC arrives she is suddenly always being saved just so she can stare in awe and say \"he's so strong\", and the rest of the characters are just typical action tropes. Oh, and all Benio and Rokuro do is bicker, even after touching moments. It get's old really fast. \\n\r\n*Feel free to skip the rest of this section since it's basically me just pointing out everything wrong with this anime's animal sicekick and comparing it to a good one from this season* \\n\r\nThe only character that stands out from the rest is Kinako, the animal sidekick of this show. This mention is not because he's a good character, but because he ruins all the enjoyment I try to get out of this anime. Everything about him, from his design to his voice and personality is so annoying. Now, let's compare him to the animal sidekick I find to be the best this season: Chito-san from Flying Witch. She's proud and intelligent, but takes it easy. She loves pranking others and going on adventures and is generally a very fun character. She cares for her owner and they fit each other well, filling up each others shortcomings, and even though Chito doesn't talk the owner understands her. Through no words we can clearly see that they care dearly about each other. Kinako is rude, loud and his only purpose is butting in and ruining moments, and yelling OH NO when a monster is nearby. His affection for Benio is ruined by the fact that they fit so poorly together and instead of showing he cares he just yells exposition and rude comments. You could remove him from the anime and it would be a lot better. Sorry for this little rant, but I just had to get it out since he is really ruining the few things I like about this anime. \\n\\n\r\nArt: The animation on the fight scenes, at least in the beginning, are pretty good. They show style and makes the fight more intense. The characters often stop to yell the name of the attack, pretty standard, but then time \"stops\" and these cool and stylish Japanese characters splat onto the screen as if it was a video game. I like that! Later on these fight scenes become way more standard, just like the rest of the show. Most of the character designs are also pretty meh. It's pretty much the safest designs you could have. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Though the OST is pretty generic and doesn't stand out, the opening by Wakkagi Band is pretty kick-ass at times. It fits the style this anime is trying to go for, and though it's failing, this opening stays pretty cool. The ending theme is nothing too special, but it's pretty okay at least. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I'm honestly getting bored. During episode 9 I could literally guess everything that was going to happen based on the anime I've seen from before. Kinako is also taking a lot away from my enjoyment. Since this anime is so predictable and safe, it's hard to take seriously. Even when the anime is trying to be intense, all I end up doing is guessing what will happen next and more than often I'm correct. It's just boring. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: I guess what I'm saying is: haven't seen any anime like this before? Watch it, you'll like it! Other than that, it's a snorefest for people who have seen this recipe before. It only works as pure entertainment, like dangling keys in front of a baby. Only recommended if this is your type of anime, but even then I think you'll think it's pretty average.",

            "content": "I had zero expectations when I first watched the show.The poster looked awful(NOTE:I am talking about the old one).It looked like a rip off of ass war's poster.Where the 2 main char looked as if they were ready from battle and you could already infer what their 1-dimensional personalities would be like.To be honest I immediately thought It was worse than sword art online just from the poster and oh boy those 5 episodes I watched sure strengthened my opinion that it was gonna be the worse show I have ever seen.\r\nNow the biggest problem I had with the show was on how bland andgeneric the characters are.All you need to know about the main character is that he is a clone of tatsumi from akame ga kill and is a tsundere with a tragic past.The main girl is a kuudere with a dream to become the best exorcist.Oh btw did I tell you that the main character also had the same dream but his tragic past made him loose that dream?Oh did I also tell you that they never even explained on why they want to become the best? It's really fucking hard to take this show seriously when it can't even explain the motivation of these characters.All they're capable of doing is spout some generic line like \"I'm gonna kill all the ghost or shit\".\\n\\n\r\nThis show is also very inconsistent with it's story.In the first episode main guy beats the monster that main  girl couldn't beat but in the next episode they're fighting each other equally.This is the show's sad attempt to make a really heated battle between the 2 characters so that it would be more \"entertaining\" even though it creates plot holes. There was this part in episode 2 where main girl was conveniently in the same area as main guy and when main girl was fighting in this other dimension it affected the real world and causes the main guy trouble and he has to save some kids.What is it with this show about having these reallly easy to spot plot conveniences and holes for the sake of having action scenes.\\n\\n\r\nI actually have more problems with episode 1 and 2 being that bad and I'm sure you would already know what my opinion is on 3,4 and 5.But even I don't have that much time to waste.",

Ok, you already know what I am gonna say about this anime, it\u2019s more of a rant than an actual review \r\nStory: 2/10\r\nHonestly, how do you mess up a already clichic shounen and make it even worse? By cutting out a bunch of plot important villains of course! And add in a some random dungeon bosses that serves no purpose at all but just for shits and giggles. This is by far the worst plot line I\u2019ve ever seen in myentire life, the ending and the intro totally contradicts it self and leaves the viewerin a total wtf state and the sole purpose of the main character that is to make a god baby have literally been given up.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 3/10\\n\r\nFor a person who thinks the absurd neck length of code geass was actually pretty good. This anime\u2019s art is absolutely, totally disgusting. Every goddamn character looks like they had a failed plastic surgery having the exact same eyes and some even with a stretched face that could double as a chopping board. The bright color of the character and the dark black ground also don\u2019t blend in with the whole style of the anime. And not to mention those destroyed city background takes up 40% of the entire anime!\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10\\n\r\nLast time I checked the story it is about an ancient society that battles monsters in the modern world. So the genuine of the music should be a blend of traditional and modern; which the third op did a incredible job. But no, they blast you with disgusting electric music that is the same throughout out the story.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 1/10\\n\r\nWhoever made this story adviously needs to be fired. The only character development they believe in is a tragic life and some op superpower that would top everything else. Hey what\u2019s even better? Oh Yeah ! A love triangle and a moment where the mc's life was endangered. Guess what anime also uses that? All other shounens, and twin stars exorcist still manage to mess it up b erasing everything they build up with comedic effects.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2/10\\n\r\nThe running animation gave me a good laugh, so 1 extra points.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10\\n\r\nSo, is twin star exorcist the worst of all time? Na, at least they tried, but I would strongly advise that nobody watches this horrible pieces of garbage. Take your time at some better anime\u2019s such as my hero academia instead.\\n\\n",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nSousei no Onmyouji contains no shortage of ohagi, a Japanese sweet treat filled with rice and covered in a delectable, bean paste. I\u2019ve never eaten the food myself; what I know of it comes from this show and the quick Google search I did in preparation for writing this anecdote out.\r\nHowever, I have seen all of Sousei no Onmyouji. Which is kind of like a ball of ohagi \u2013 if it were spoiled, unappetizing, and missing any semblance of nutritional value.\r\nSTORY\r\nSousei no Onmyouji contains a total of fifty episodes. That number equates to a one-yearrun, or, using relevant jargon, a 4-cour show. At approximately twenty-four minutes per episode, that\u2019s twenty whole hours of content. That\u2019s a lot by today\u2019s standards since most projects nowadays only go for 1-cour outings with the uncommon 2-cour stretch thrown in. At twice and-or four times the length of a typical anime, the show has a ton of time to either get things right or get things wrong.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, it lands somewhere hard on the latter side.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime more or less splits up into seven distinct arcs: the Introductory Arc, the Relationship-Building Arc, the Yuto Arc, the Sae Arc, the Distraction Arc, the Floating-City Arc, and the Final Arc. These arcs vary in their execution, so it is best to separate them in this fashion before looking at the show in its entirety.\\n\\n\r\nFirst comes the Introductory Arc. True to its name, these initial six episodes introduce the audience to what the tale will focus on. They present the important world-building details like the evil Kegare, the alternate dimension of Megano, and the Twelve Guardians. They establish the tenuous connection between Benio and Rokuro. They setup the Twin Star plot. Standard material that simply gets the show pointing in the right direction from the get-go.\\n\\n\r\nThe Relationship-Building Arc comes next, and it is arguably the best arc in the series. From episode seven to episode thirteen, Rokuro and Benio not only begin to live together in a mansion gifted to them by head-exorcist Arima but also the two start to build their bond towards something meaningful (if not romantic). Big revelations, like Rokuro\u2019s past and Benio\u2019s indirect connection to him through her twin brother Yuto, come to light. Also, the anime does a nice job of balancing the Kegare battles with the more slice-of-life material (e.g., \u201cBenio Special,\u201d their faux date).\\n\\n\r\nThis arc also shows the first major signs of problems down the line. To its credit, the concept of Resonance, where Benio and Rokuro connect on a psychological level to dish out extra spirit power, makes for a pretty cool moment. However, introducing a key part to Benio\u2019s past \u2013 her parents\u2019 death \u2013 and addressing it within the exact same episode mere minutes later does not make for solid writing. Regardless, this arc does enough to boost Sousei no Onmyouji\u2019s appeal.\\n\\n\r\nFollowing a completely unnecessary recap of these first thirteen episodes in episode fourteen (wherein Mayura\u2019s wish to have her feelings reach Rokuro only further buries her chances), the show proceeds to the Yuto Arc. While this arc contains some lighter events, such as Ryougo\u2019s romance with Haruka, it mostly focuses on Kegare Corruption, Yuto\u2019s villainy, and the Twin Stars overcoming their toughest trial yet.\\n\\n\r\nMuch like the Relationship-Building Arc, the Yuto Arc has its mixture of both nice and questionable writing decisions. Benio loses her legs, acting as a clever parallel to Rokuro\u2019s lost arm. Better yet, Kamui, the Basara that killed Benio\u2019s parents, creates them for her in a cruel twist of fate. Rokuro\u2019s deceased friends from the Hanatsuki Tragedy then support him in his final duel with Yuto, creating an interesting (and cathartic) moment.\\n\\n\r\nOn the less-than-ideal writing side, Mayura\u2019s corruption occurs almost instantly after she chooses to back Rokuro\u2019s decision to continue fighting. Reigen (Mayura\u2019s father) somehow doesn\u2019t perish after the buildup and emotions behind his (what should have been) sacrifice. And the whole fight against Yuto amounts to nothing when, after everything that has happened in episode nineteen and episode twenty, he presumably lives (which the show later confirms).\\n\\n\r\nTheir failure to ever finish the job carries over into the Sae Arc. At this point, Sousei no Onmyouji\u2019s slow decline begins. Most notably, the two-year time skip is ineffective. Despite such a shakeup to the plot, nothing of note changes between Benio and Rokuro, and this period does not affect the narrative to a worthwhile extent. It makes the audience wonder why such a skip was needed in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nIn this arc, the anime introduces Sae herself, a little girl who cannot listen to anyone and stay put when told to do so. Again, smaller lighthearted asides, like Benio \u201closing\u201d at rock-paper-scissors and Rokuro in awe of \u201cjewelry,\u201d try to keep that action-and-slice-of-life balance. But the anime\u2019s incessant need to bring in a new Basaras, only for him or her to runaway soon after, overshadows these grounded moments.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode twenty-four with the \u201cbeauty\u201d almost-Basara and episode thirty with Sae\u2019s departing present to her \u201cparents\u201d do make for interesting, even emotional scenes. But Rokuro and Benio\u2019s relationship more or less takes a backseat to the asides, the fights, and the fleeing Basaras. A trade-off that does not pay dividends.\\n\\n\r\nSae\u2019s return to the Ame-no-mihashira marks the end of her arc and starts the Distraction Arc \u2013 and more declining. Sousei no Onmyouji continues to ignore Benio and Rokuro\u2019s relationship because (ironically enough) it\u2019s too distracted with letting others take care of the Basaras that popped up from the previous arc. Even when it does finally remember to address their relationship, arguably the most important aspect of the show, the plot conveniently cuts off his confession to her with a literal Earth-shattering quake.\\n\\n\r\nOr, even worse, it provides more unneeded recaps in episode thirty-two and, in the same episode, has the two protagonists dancing all happily to Suzu\u2019s heavy-metal song. A moment that goes down as the most bizarre scene in the entire anime.\\n\\n\r\nThis quake leads into the shortest arc of the lot, the Floating-City Arc. Kuranashi, the big-bad baddie who has been scheming since that time skip (and apparently for thousands of years in total), unleashes his ultimate plan using the hypnotized, miasma-filled lesser exorcists and a ginormous plant-tentacle Kegare. All to capture the Twelve Guardians to steal their power for his own. This arc is rather straightforward in that it involves lots of action and not much else save for a bit of backstory on Seigen. The only truly important development is also one of the most asinine: Yuto revives himself by double-crossing Kuranashi.\\n\\n\r\nYuto\u2019s return pushes Sousei no Onmyouji into the Final Arc and into complete decline. Disregarding the convenience surrounding Arima\u2019s spell usage to escape death, this arc contains a heap of troubles.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole \u201cjoining\u201d angle is weird and uncomfortable, especially since Seimei takes the yang out of Benio\u2019s soul regardless.\\n\\n\r\nBenio doesn\u2019t comment on Yuto\u2019s death despite the tension in their relationship and the fact that he is literally her twin brother.\\n\\n\r\nThe Cataclysm King thread is introduced way too late at this point in the story.\\n\\n\r\nRokuro being inspired by an impromptu dance number from Suzu the Basara forces the audience\u2019s hand to their foreheads.\\n\\n\r\nThe lose-a-teammate-at-each-junction sequence does not have the emotional weight the anime believes that it does.\\n\\n\r\nAs a last hail-Mary attempt, the story tries to play with the idea that sin is a necessary evil. That it ultimately spawns love and happiness, making these feelings stronger as a result of the struggle and fortitude to reach them. A reasonable and thoughtful theme. However, when the show tries to say that the Kegare aren\u2019t all evil as an argument, the idea breaks down. Killing Kegare has always been Rokuro, Benio, and everyone else\u2019s goal. Plus, these creatures hunted and attacked humans to begin with. Double plus, the show did not do enough comparing of both sides to warrant such introspection.\\n\\n\r\nDue to the large number of episodes, going over the individual arcs in this fashion still did not include some other positives and most certainly left out many more negatives. Nevertheless, this breakdown should illustrate that Sousei no Onmyouji started relatively solid but eventually declined into a problematic mess.\\n\\n\r\nWhat about on an overall scale? Sadly, the mess only gets worse.\\n\\n\r\nFor example, the show has a huge problem when it comes to the power levels involved. In essence, they have no rhyme or reason half the time. Benio and Rokuro are the Twin Star Exorcists, but, after the Relationship-Building Arc, they almost never seem to defeat their enemies or succeed in battle whatsoever. No matter if they fight on their own or with Resonance, they are weak either against the Basaras or juxtaposed with the Twelve Guardians.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, it\u2019s safe to bet that they will lose in some fashion since their lousy dialogue, when they aren\u2019t repeating the same words on strength and determination, jinxes the outcome of their fights. Classic phrases like \u201cWe got him for sure this time!\u201d or \u201cIs he defeated?\u201d inevitably mean that, no, they did not in fact defeat their foe. So, on the impossible off chance that they do win, it either feels like a miracle or just doesn\u2019t make sense.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime also has an odd tonal issue in that the seriousness behind death and danger in their various situations rarely seems to matter. They\u2019ll square off against a smattering of Kegare in basically the underworld to save a bunch of elementary-school kids one instant, and they\u2019ll happily crack jokes while eating ohagi in a restaurant the next. Not to mention that these abnormal atrocities involve Rokuro and Benio when they are young teenagers and occasionally kids themselves, making their ordeals almost too outlandish.\\n\\n\r\nSousei no Onmyouji also has fundamental issues. One such issue takes the form of Rokuro\u2019s arm. Since the only weapon he has at his disposal is essentially a glorified fist, his available actions are way too restrictive. Thus, many of his fights involve lots of repetition since new moves almost never appear. Air Fissure Bullet can take care of smaller enemies, and his combos with Benio provide flashier abilities. But, in general, Rokuro only swinging his right arm unendingly cannot be deemed engaging let alone impressive.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, the Kegare fought throughout the season don\u2019t often matter. They usually exist as just big blobs or giant animalistic, humanoid creatures that need to be slashed or exploded in nearly the exact same way. I.e., there\u2019s rarely any tactics, strategy, or thought that goes into each skirmish besides \u201cthrow moves at them until something works.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nNot to mention the lackluster writing throughout the season. Mayura\u2019s semi-not-even love triangle had no place in the narrative when she never tries to earn Rokuro\u2019s attention and the show is literally about him and Benio growing romantically closer. Also, in hindsight, Kegare Corruption no longer remains a talking point or potential threat after the Yuto Arc. Given its efficacy and danger, it makes very little sense for the story to almost never mention this detail again (even if Yuto\u2019s incapacitated state renders such magic irrelevant). Arima\u2019s Burial Ritual on Rokuro\u2019s heart also makes very little sense when it amounts to nothing after the tension built behind such an action.\\n\\n\r\nThe Miko angle, the arguable driving force behind the show, is the worst. Two-year time skip or no, Benio and Rokuro are way too young to have a baby. But that means that, for fifty episodes worth of content, this plot point remains a carrot on a stick forever. The audience chases after and looks forward to this development, but they never actually get to see anything related to it appear.\\n\\n\r\nThat carrot will eventually be reached, but not before it rots away. Very much like this anime.\\n\\n\r\nART & ANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, Sousei no Onmyouji\u2019s art and animation do not allow it to recover much from the continual decline of its story.\\n\\n\r\nIn the beginning of the season, the anime had at least a competent level of consistency. Benio sprints around everywhere as she fights. Rokuro destroys enemies with a starry explosion. The two engage in spats that span multiple actions and reactions. While nothing jaw-dropping occurs, the anime avoids major hiccups in the visuals presented.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, as early as episode eleven, wherein Benio\u2019s head concaves awkwardly into itself, the anime signals the start of major errors and that it just cannot keep up. Misshapen faces due to incorrect eye placements, janky proportions, and weird expressions. Too much reused animation at times such as during Suzu\u2019s ridiculous heavy-metal performance; lackluster animation in many of the fights and even in the most basic of interactions.\\n\\n\r\nA particularly egregious example goes down in episode thirty-six. Mayura talks with Benio as the two girls work to incapacitate the zombified students. When Benio responds, however, the show forgets to move her mouth and face to match her reaction and words for half the frame. So, instead of a regular delivery of her lines, the anime instead treats the audience to a static image of Benio agape a few seconds longer than intended.\\n\\n\r\nYet it can have sparks of something more. The black, grainy sidebars during flashbacks make it easy to visually understand when these depicted events take place due to the old-timey film look. Furthermore, the show includes a cool stylized overlay whenever a character performs a special move. Japanese kanji crash onto the screen, colorful effects abound, and a profile shot of the character about to take action streaks open, giving the whole sequence a \u201cIt\u2019s about to go down\u2026\u201d vibe.\\n\\n\r\nBackground art generally doesn\u2019t stick out, but, when they travel to Magano, that perspective changes. In this opposing reality, the red and brown coloring paints a dark, hellish landscape. The dilapidated buildings and destroyed streets likewise infuse the area with sadness and dread.\\n\\n\r\nAnd while the character designs are usually not impressive (Rokuro\u2019s jagged teeth imply a sense of immaturity, Benio\u2019s purple motif coincides with her princess persona), they can sometimes be a bit intriguing. Tatara\u2019s emoticon face is strange but silly, and Mayura\u2019s Kegare Corruption is wicked with her purple-and-pink hair, orange-and-black eyes, and a flower foundation.\\n\\n\r\nAlso of note, some of the opening tracks have nice visuals, like the second\u2019s foreshadowing of Benio\u2019s lost legs or the fourth\u2019s ending shot as she stands on her tippy toes to lock lips with Rokuro.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s the third opening track, though, that turns heads with its decidedly avant-garde visuals. The Twin Stars jostle as the dinner table they sit at rotates. The light-refracting, destiny-driven puppeteering of the two heroes. That one plane which transforms into a bunch of butterflies. The focus on shapes and mirroring.\\n\\n\r\nA very interesting set of images indeed \u2013 but even they succumb to errors. For, once the anime realizes that the parallel shot between Rokuro and Benio standing side-by-side does not work because Rokuro weirdly shows off his Kegare arm while Benio does not show off her Kegare legs, it instead puts his arm back to normal for each time the track plays afterwards.\\n\\n\r\nIf even the opening track\u2019s visuals have errors (corrected or not), that should indicate well enough the weakness of the artistry overall.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nSousei no Onmyouji contains a huge cast of characters. Much like the story, then, it\u2019s best to break them up into particular categories: the good guys, the bad guys, and the Twin Stars themselves.\\n\\n\r\nStarting with the good guys, the Twelve Guardians stand out. Shimon the flame wielder, Subaru the proper, Victorian lady, and Seigen the dreary-eyed grumpy dude notably make more of a name for themselves. Shimon trained under Seigen, Subaru trained Benio (and did her best to change Rokuro and Benio\u2019s relationship for the better), and Seigen looked after both Rokuro and Yuto while also fathering Mayura. Sakura and Miku do receive a small amount of backstory when fighting Moro, and Arima pops up from time to time with silliness and information of his own, but Shimon, Subaru, and Seigen bring the most intrigue with their seriousness, difference, and protection (respectively).\\n\\n\r\nIn comparison, almost none of the characters from the Seika Dormitory matter \u2013 save for Ryougo. Ryougo is like an older brother to Rokuro, playing along with his teasing \u201cservant\u201d claims, looking out for him, believing in him, and wishing only the best for the troubled teen. He isn\u2019t around as much throughout a sizable chunk of the middle portion of the season, but Ryougo\u2019s kindness and maturity make him a very likable guy on top of being a worthwhile person in Rokuro\u2019s life. So, when he falls in love with Haruka and eventually gets married to her (in the last episode no less), he definitely deserves such happiness.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the extra side characters, Sousei no Onmyouji focuses mostly on Mayura, Sae, and Kinako. Mayura is Rokuro\u2019s childhood friend. She has supported him throughout his entire life, and she befriends Benio to somewhat melt the unfriendly girl\u2019s icy shell. The time skip sees her becoming a full-fledged exorcist, and, during the Floating-City Arc, she even commands her father\u2019s Guardian power when they work together to stall Kuranashi. Her presumed-inevitable romance with Shimon also makes for a nice bit of recompense since her feelings for Rokuro were doomed from the very start.\\n\\n\r\nSae the tree branch and Kinako the familiar also receive attention. Sae has one major role: showcasing the Twin Stars as potential parents. A role she takes on well with her memorization of Benio\u2019s Ohagi Man Song and calling Rokuro \u201cPapa.\u201d Kinako serves Benio and belittles Rokuro, but he also has much more important duties like providing transportation and creating comedic relief here and there. He even gets nearly all of episode thirty-one to himself when his backstory and beginnings with Benio play out.\\n\\n\r\nIn total, the good guys may not contribute a ton to Sousei no Onmyouji in a critical or impactful sense, but they at least do not take anything away from the show by their inclusion. A sentiment that cannot be said of the bad guys.\\n\\n\r\nTo put it lightly, the villains of the anime are horrible in their construction. Many of the lesser Basaras miss out on crucial connections to the story in that they show up, leave, and show up once more only to perish in the their second arrival. They can have an inkling of characterization, like Yamato wanting to upstage Kuranashi or Chijiwa (mistakenly) seeking revenge against Benio and Rokuro for his deceased twin brother (killed by Kuranashi). Moreover, they are fodder in the grand scheme of things. But their relevance is way too flimsy for supposed threats.\\n\\n\r\nThe greater Basaras consist of Kuranashi, Suzu, and Kamui. Kuranashi (initially) becomes the main antagonist after the time skip (in episode twenty) but only indirectly. He does not directly take part in any fights or says anything worthwhile until his duel with Arima (in episode thirty-three). Even then, his motivations are not revealed until later (in episode thirty-eight) where his \u201cjust in it for the entertainment\u201d answer is eye-rolling in its lameness. Despite having this \u201celaborate\u201d plan concocted and executed perfectly over the course of 1000 years, his death (in episode forty-one) leaves him unable to accomplish anything and turns him into a completely uninteresting baddie.\\n\\n\r\nSuzu and Kamui aren\u2019t as prevalent as Kuranashi (indirectly or otherwise), but their neutral stances amidst the warring that goes on certainly makes them more interesting. However, they still hurt Sousei no Onmyouji\u2019s overall execution nonetheless. Disregarding Suzu\u2019s off-kilter songs, she conveniently appears whenever or wherever she wants.\\n\\n\r\nAnd Kamui did have potential given his dual connection to Benio for killing her parents and granting her Kegare legs. However, he also has a lame motivation with \u201cjust in it to fight strong opponents\u201d and, after episode twenty, he doesn\u2019t reappear until episode forty-nine. As if the anime forgot about him then hurriedly shoved him back in. The kicker, though? His arc is left open-ended come the end of the season, so his reappearance didn\u2019t matter to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nAbe no Seimei is not a Basara, but he opposes everyone all the same. He at least has a definitive motive \u2013 eradicating all sin to form a serendipitous world of nothing but unending happiness \u2013 but his random inclusion, his boring, emotionless personality, and obvious-not-obvious familiar who leads the Twelve Guardians in Arima\u2019s absence fail to make him a worthwhile enemy as well.\\n\\n\r\nSuppose one views all these bad guys like the good guys in that many of them are not really that important. This scenario still leaves Yuto who no doubt is important \u2013 and who goes down as the worst character in the anime and one of the worst villains in the medium.\\n\\n\r\nAs a kid, Yuto did not respect his parents for touting ideals without accomplishments of their own. He also hated Benio for always being weak. So, it comes as no surprise that this selfish misanthrope goes off the deep end and forcefully corrupts the children of the Hanatsuki Tragedy into Kegare.\\n\\n\r\nThus, the anime sets Yuto up as a rather vile, hate-worthy character. Most of this information comes from episode nine when Yuto officially appears for the very first time. To which he promptly disappears for eight more episodes, interfering not at all until episode seventeen. It\u2019s not until episode nineteen where he unveils his motivation. That, similar to Kuranashi and Kamui, is way too lame: \u201cjust want to be the strongest exorcist.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nCredit where credit is due, Yuto is a downright annoying antagonist. But his maniacal, powerful self doesn\u2019t come from a solid foundation but rather loose writing. The \u201ctwist\u201d about his birth, how he is an accidental byproduct of Benio\u2019s spiritual conception, comes way too late (in episode forty-six) and as an uncared for heap of exposition.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless, he miraculously loses to Rokuro and Benio in episode twenty \u2013 and then he does not show up again until episode forty-two. Like Kamui, that\u2019s a long time to go without the main antagonist. Not a peep and barely a mention of him occurs in this twenty-two-episode span, but his final return sees him randomly resting out of nowhere in the Ame-no-mihashira, conveniently beating Kuranashi at his own scheming game, and magically earning omnipotence.\\n\\n\r\nSousei no Onmyouji tries to slightly redeem Yuto\u2019s character when it ramps up his obsession with Rokuro to somewhere beyond just old pals. Moreover, they liken his existence to less of a nemesis and more of a fate-bound catalyst. Yet, when the anime shoehorns in some last-minute backstory about him and Rokuro right before his death, this mistimed and mishandled info reminds the audience of Yuto\u2019s abysmal construction.\\n\\n\r\nCombined with the fact that the anime does not go into detail on how Yuto learned the dark art of Kegare Corruption. And that the anime does not explore his past relationships with his parents or Benio. And that the anime does not even explain how or why he wears an eyepatch. It all adds up into one pathetic character, villain, or any other related moniker that can be given to such an asinine cast member.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the good guys and the bad guys have their parts to play in the show, they are not the stars (in more ways than one). That honor goes to the main protagonists: Rokuro and Benio.\\n\\n\r\nBefore Rokuro and Benio eventually teamed up, they lived separate yet similar lives. Lives whose origins the audience sees through a series flashbacks that span the first twenty episodes. Rokuro was found somewhere in Megano, he survived the Hanatsuki Tragedy instigated by Yuto, and he quit being an exorcist as a result of his inability to save his friends. Benio looked up to her twin brother Yuto, lost her parents right before her eyes to Kamui the Basara in Megano, and she steeled herself to become stronger than ever.\\n\\n\r\nSo, when these two (eventual) lovebirds first \u201cmeet\u201d (quotes because this meeting involves Rokuro jumping off a bridge to catch a falling, unconscious Benio), they exist on opposite sides of the spectrum despite the similarities in their traumatic pasts. They don\u2019t initially know what each one went through, though, meaning Rokuro\u2019s immaturity and Benio\u2019s standoffish personality puts them on an unfriendly basis from the get-go.\\n\\n\r\nNot long after, Arima declares Benio and Rokuro the Twin Star Exorcists. Which means that, besides their immense potential as exorcists, they are destined to conceive the Miko, the child who will end the Kegare threat forevermore. Naturally, this inevitably means love, marriage, and bedroom fun.\\n\\n\r\nSo, the two start to grow closer together. Arima\u2019s free-mansion giveaway and Subaru\u2019s guiding hand spring up events like a missing hairpiece and feeding food to the other at a pancake restaurant. Rokuro\u2019s indirect connection to Benio through Yuto almost destroys their relationship in episode nine, but, thankfully, the truth of the situation comes out, and they become ever closer still in a mutual pact of their own choosing.\\n\\n\r\nTheir relationship moves forward a major step when they support one another in their first (and only) fight against Kamui. In unison, they perform Resonance, an ability that only the Twin Stars are capable of using to empower their respective halves and in turn permitting more winning opportunities. Afterwards, they are put in their place mentally when they cannot help as intended, they perfect their use of Resonance, and, in the process of \u201cdefeating\u201d Yuto, Rokuro upgrades his arm and Benio \u201cupgrades\u201d her legs.\\n\\n\r\nAt this point, the underlying theme of these characters becomes quite clear: One can go it alone, but a partner makes life much more remarkable. The purposeful relationship between Rokuro and Benio, the importance placed on their union both in the fights and in the future, and even the title of the anime itself (Twin Star Exorcists) point at the idea that a person can accomplish much, much more than they thought possible if he or she relies on another.\\n\\n\r\nArguably, Sousei no Onmyouji takes it one level further with the romance angle, advocating to some degree that love can overcome any of life\u2019s obstacles. Benio and Rokuro are individually strong, but, as their feelings for each other grow, they bolster the other both physically and emotionally. However, the show keeps the base of its theme going with its other characters as well. Mayura and her father Seigen. Ryougo and his wife Haruka. Even on the Basara side with Chijiwa and his counterpart Momochi.\\n\\n\r\nIn total, the theme itself is not exactly explored. While all these relationships exist, the anime doesn\u2019t spend much time expounding on the importance of such connections with either words or intermittent challenges. Indeed, it places focus more so on the many battles and the must-get-stronger mindset. Nevertheless, such bonds improve their capabilities for the better.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, following the time skip, Benio and Rokuro do not evolve their relationship much (if at all). Despite living together and fighting together and doing everything together, almost nothing has happened or changed between the two for two whole years. Even disregarding this fact, the newer characters, the increased amount of unrelated action, and the need to push the plot along get in the way of blossoming their love.\\n\\n\r\nAs the final thirteen or so episodes roll around, the show finally gets back to their relationship. A love letter to Rokuro makes Benio want to know Rokuro\u2019s feelings about her. And Rokuro, turning down that written confession, thinks more seriously about the topic. While their exchange of love gets interrupted more times than a comedian bombing on stage, a curry conversation here and a hill tumble there bring them slowly and ever-so-close to the next part of their progression.\\n\\n\r\nBut not before events tear them apart. Benio\u2019s near death at the hands of (a returning) Yuto forces Rokuro to reconsider his relationship with her. Extra information about his past and his role as the Cataclysm King comes forth too, redoubling his rethinking. After much thought, he casts Benio aside in a rather heartbreaking manner. A strange choice given the entire point of the show and their characters specifically is how their bond means more than anything they could do alone.\\n\\n\r\nStill, Rokuro wants to keep Benio safe and does not want to tie her down to a Kegare (i.e., himself), so he burdens the troubles and the worries by his lonesome. Once he transforms, and having already realized her feelings for him, Benio makes the extremely difficult decision of sacrificing herself to save Rokuro, knowing that she may never, ever see him again.\\n\\n\r\nYet Benio believes in Rokuro\u2019s perseverance. Included yin-yang parallels aside, Rokuro, now back to normal, steels himself (with the help of Arima, Suzu, Kinako, Mayura, and his other friends) to save Benio from Abe no Seimei\u2019s clutches. While Benio\u2019s hairpin-laser-connector plan seems a little wacky even within the context of the anime, their confession in episode forty-nine more than makes up for it. Rokuro and Benio bicker atop the blossomed Ame-no-mihashira as a major clash between spirit dragons goes on in the background. Their lover\u2019s quarrel leads to him kissing her and her kissing him in a double exchange of emotions that connects them back together in wonderful fashion.\\n\\n\r\nTheir final Resonance of the season relies less on their relationship and more on the (spiritual) support of the many people they met and interacted with throughout the season, tying back to the characters\u2019 central idea. Thus, they save the world, and the two somewhat embarrass themselves at Ryougo\u2019s wedding. Their sincere speech then gives way to Rokuro gifting Benio a new set of hair clips, matching the same event between the two just before the two-year skip. Only this time, they end it on a kiss, letting the audience understand that these two have and will have each other to make their lives remarkable forevermore.\\n\\n\r\nAltogether, Benio and Rokuro are not strong characters. They are not weak characters either. The show simply forgets to expound on them come the middle of the season, preventing their growth beyond a middling level. On top of the passable good guys and the abhorrent bad guys, the execution here just does not end up anywhere favorable.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC & SOUND\\n\\n\r\nSousei no Onmyouji lands everywhere on the execution map when it comes to its music and sound design. For example, the opening tracks go in different directions when compared to one another to add some much-needed diversity.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cValkyrie -Ikusa Otome-,\u201d the first OP, uses shamisen for a cultural feel and punctual breaks in the tempo to bring on the intensity. \u201cRe:Call,\u201d the second OP, incorporates a steadier beat and set of vocals, but the song stays around for too many episodes after the narrative\u2019s time skip (if the visuals are any indication) where the body of the plot has already shifted.\\n\\n\r\n\u201csync\u201d (no capital \u201cs\u201d), the third OP, moves between a male and female vocalist as a hip-hop groove with shouts and drops keeps the flow of the piece (coincidentally enough) in sync. And \u201cKanadeai,\u201d the fourth and final OP, takes on a sentimental, rock \u2018n\u2019 roll tone for a more thoughtful song to lead out the season.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, these opening tracks are some of the best parts of Sousei no Onmyouji. In comparison, the ending tracks do not contain as much variety since they each aim for a romantic vibe. They also do not reach the same level of intrigue.\\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, they still work within the confines of the show. \u201cEyes,\u201d the first ED, brings in daintier instrumentals whereas \u201cYadoriboshi,\u201d the second ED, brings in piano and violin to back its grandiose composition. \u201cHide and Seek,\u201d the third ED, gets more fun with a faster pace and its volley of triplets, and \u201cHotarubi\u201d returns to that cultural feel while mixing together subdued and boisterous segments.\\n\\n\r\nElsewhere besides the start and the finale of each episode, the original soundtrack hits highs and lows. Interesting tracks such as the 8-bit-esque and flute-like tunes for its slice-of-life moments help the mood. But the electronic, dubstep pieces, like the one with the distorted monster voices most often played when Kegare appear, do not mesh too well with the setting and the premise and the action at hand.\\n\\n\r\nDoubly so for Suzu\u2019s metal performance in episode twenty-two. A song that leaves the audience nothing short of flabbergasted at its inclusion, head-shaking at its corny lyrics and weak vocal delivery.\\n\\n\r\nBesides the OST, Sousei no Onmyouji contains a couple of very interesting audio tricks. Most notably, in episode sixteen, when Rokuro and Benio use Resonance consciously for the first time, the anime employs a back-and-forth voiceover with Rokuro only speaking in the right ear and Benio only speaking in the left ear.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, speaking of voice acting, while the performances aren\u2019t the most impressive across the board, Megumi Han as Benio and Natsuki Hanae as Rokuro still deserve props. They scream as fervently and as often as possible throughout each fight and during their different moves. So much so that one hopes they had a few cough drops on hand to stave off injury.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nDespite how much I have written against this anime up to this point, I can\u2019t say that I despise it. \u201cHate\u201d is too harsh of a word, too. Instead, I simply very strongly dislike most things about the show.\\n\\n\r\nMy dislike stems from multiple aspects \u2013 Yuto chief among them. Seriously. He\u2019s the absolute worst part of the show. I cannot stand him as a character; he\u2019s much too infallible. I am also not fond of Arima. I could do without his \u201ccomedy,\u201d and his general worthlessness throughout almost the entire season despite literally being in charge of the Exorcist Union.\\n\\n\r\nThe action is another large factor. Admittedly, I\u2019m not the biggest fan of action-oriented shows, but what goes on here treads way too far into sameness. Considering how much fighting goes on, I usually found myself disinterested in the proceedings. Along the same lines, the drama involved rarely pulled me in, and the show didn\u2019t have as much of a thematic presence as I would have liked.\\n\\n\r\nGlimpses of fun exist within all this mud. Mayura\u2019s silly name-calling insults had me chuckling. Subaru was attractive with her teasing attitude, air of decadence, and fan usage. Ryougo was a pretty cool dude too, for I liked his brotherly persona in relation to Rokuro. And I actually laughed at Tenma demonstrating his almighty powers by yelling at the Dragon Spot to close and Cordelia cursing in English with her robotic voice.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, these characters and their qualities cannot always be around, so they do not necessarily wash away the dirt that follows the negatives I have with the show.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the Twin Stars, I do find Rokuro and Benio (Benio more so) likable to an extent. Rokuro can get a bit righteous at times, but he has his heart in the right place. And Benio\u2019s quiet behavior contrasts with her occasional outbursts of silliness and passion to make her more than meets the eye.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, their romance caught my attention the most. Seeing them struggle to get along when first encountering each other. The hand-holding scenes and signs of affection before the middle portions. Their ultimate confession of love with kisses to boot. I found myself smiling on more than one occasion as their feelings for each other grew.\\n\\n\r\nBut I still have a gripe: The romance just isn\u2019t around enough. I\u2019m reiterating myself at this point, but, after the Relationship-Building Arc and the Yuto Arc, their bond drowns in a vat of stagnation. Even when the Floating-City Arc resurfaces those lovey-dovey feelings, three separate interruptions prolong what should have been said between the two literal in-universe years prior.\\n\\n\r\nForgiving those scenes, the final stretch still doesn\u2019t prioritize the romance until episode forty-four where Rokuro pushes Benio away to protect her and episode forty-seven where Benio sacrifices herself to bring Rokuro back. I do really like their shared confession, but it also makes me wonder what could have been had their relationship always remained at the forefront.\\n\\n\r\nSousei no Onmyouji delivers a show that hobbles along and crumbles apart the whole way through. Over the course of fifty episodes, the broken storytelling, the inexcusable artistic issues, the weak character writing, the mediocre audio offerings, and the low level of entertainment make for an ohagi overdose that upsets the stomach for much too long and without hardly any tangible benefits.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Terrible, a narrative replete with problematic individual arcs and a laundry list of overarching issues that decline this tale into a complete mess\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: Bad, the visuals clearly cannot keep up as fewer frames and extra errors steadily emerge, but the world of Megano and some interesting artistic choices inject much-needed flair\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Bad, the good guys pass but lack impact, the bad guys contribute nothing but lameness, Yuto is one of worst villains ever, and both Benio and Rokuro did not receive as much focus as they required\\n\\n\r\nMusic & Sound: Fine, a diverse set of OPs, an average set of EDs, a mixture of nice and questionable tracks in the OST, a cool back-and-forth technique, and lots of shouting from the VA performances allow the audio to stand at least upright\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Bad, some funny insults, a curse word, and a few likable characters fail to form a worthwhile experience as annoying characters, boring action, and missing romance hamper the project\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 2/10",

            "content": "I dropped it after episode 26, it has simply lost it's charm for me at this point totally. The story became easy to predict, the romance was gone \"although it was quite good while it lasted\". But we'll get into everything later. Let's begin with...\r\n==========STORY==========\r\nThe story was boring, concept was nothing special, overall a big meh and a pack of nails. Mediocre to not be too harsh on it. I liked few moments, but they were overrun by all the cliches and i just can't stand cliches when there's no decent romance or an objective to accomplish. I won't spoil anything but i can sayit was really bad after the 20th episode. The pacing was kinda weird too, starting off quite slowly and then doing a 180 grade turn and rushing from one place to another (people who watched will understand). Overall story isn't a good point in this one.\\n\\n\r\n==========ART==========\\n\r\nI mean it's hard to draw anime that's for sure, i have all the respect in the world for people who actually do it manually so i may not go so harsh on them. The art was good to look at, with some minor flaws in animations but it kept a fine level, the color scheme was quite wide, and... charismatic so it was easily distinguishable but other from that there was nothing wild.\\n\\n\r\n==========SOUND==========\\n\r\nSome dubstep here and there, cool openings and overall voice acting was good if not very good really. But people have different tastes so i can't say much about it. I appreciate sound to it's fullest and if my leg starts moving while i listen to the music in a scene it must be at least catchy or good. Take my word for it and listen to the background, i know almost nothing to little about the shounen tropes as to music so i can't really tell you if it was something out of the ordinary or just another cliche. I just simply haven't watched so much shounens.\\n\\n\r\n==========CHARACTER==========\\n\r\nNope, terrible. Most of them are boring and bland, typical, stereotypical etc. Really bad or rather mediocre and i haven't grown to like any of them. And if you say that 26 episodes is much too early to say that and i couldn't grow to like them because i haven't watched the whole series, you're wrong. I grew personally more attached to some characters in mediocre 12episodes long anime series and if i watched whole Sousei no Onmyouji i would probably like them because of guilt, and the time i've spent on them.\\n\\n\r\n==========ENJOYMENT==========\\n\r\nFrom the 26 episode demo i've brought out only the romance. And it was good. Which i'm a big fan of, that's where the 7 is from. The rest i give a big 0, cause it's just bland bad.\\n\\n\r\n==========OVERALL==========\\n\r\nWatch first 20 episodes and you're done.\\n\r\nIf you get past the 30 episode mark without killing yourself once you're a boi.\\n\r\nIf you get past the 35 episode mark without killing yourself once, you're a big boi\\n\r\nIf you watch the whole series without flinching or sighing even once, you're a god.",

            "content": "(TL;DR : Don't bother watching this show)\r\nI'm not gonna waste your time, so i'll get into the specifics quick. This show is painstakingly average. It feels as if it is trying its hardest not to be different. It doesn't want to break the mold and try something new. Which is a shame because it starts off pretty interesting. \r\nTo be honest, this show probably could have been pulled off better if it wasn't for the lackluster animation. In the first episode, it got me pretty hyped up seeing what the show could have been. While the plot instantly comes off as nothing special, the animationseemed to reflect a livelier side to it.  But the more I watched, the quality dived more and more until it became so noticeable I had to pause it and take a deep breath to appreciate how much the artists screwed up. In the last episode I watched, episode 13,  the main characters who are teenagers are barely bigger than oil barrels in the background. Not only that, the flaming fox spirit who is a recurring character is stagnant. Not moving despite being made of fire of all things. \\n\\n\r\nThe fights are insanely boring and poorly planned out. You have Rokuro, the main character with an insanely awesome spell that transforms his fist into something that reminds you of a demon or a dragon, only knows how to do one thing. And that's just throw a right punch. There's nothing more than that. Even if it sounds reasonable considering it's on his right arm and he probably doesn't need to know much else, the bigger issue is the animation supporting it. The only variation you see with Rokuro's punches is him throwing a right fist and a close up of his screaming face. The animators don't attempt to make the fight interesting and seemingly gave up in varying the fights or scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound also seems to lack impact. Several times an old sound clip from older media you've heard before plays. Like a sword clashing or the standard anime explosion. It doesn't feel unique. Sometimes they even feel too quiet, giving what felt like a big punch or a heavy attack the impact of a pillow hitting somebody. Now, this might be a personal nitpick, but the show kind of has a techno themed soundtrack a lot of the time. In one scene where it got emotional and characters are developing and pouring their heart out in front of an enemy monster (Kegare), it played some high tempo techno, which felt very unfitting. This problem seems to be consistent throughout the show. Some may be a fan of it, but knowing when to hold off for certain scenes should be common sense. \\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't bother watching this show. If you want something better with a slightly similar concept, go watch Tokyo Ravens.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Is this the new great shounen anime? The manga has a rating above 8, so surely the anime must have something to offer, right?\r\nStory:\r\nVery generic shounen stuff. Hyperactive boy wants to become stronger, is destined to become the greatest, you know the drill. If that was it, it wouldn't even be so bad, after all, a good copy is often better than something creative but bad. This however only makes up 50% of the story. The other half is everybody trying to get the main characters to have sex. It's not even subtle, like they want them to fall in love because they're so cutetogether or anything, no. They try to force them to have sex as soon as possible, because they are supposed to make a super exorcist baby. This is portrayed as charming and funny and results in the most forced romance I've ever witnessed.\\n\r\n1/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nSousei no Onmyouji looks anything but impressive. The characters look very bland and blocky, so they tried to give them unique features like Rokuros shark teeth. The only thing they really paid attention to was the kegare fights, which look pretty good. Sadly, the kegare all pretty much look the same, they are just huge brown monsters.\\n\r\n4/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI can't say anything bad about the voice acting, all pretty solid. The opening is great, I like that feudal rock style. I also enjoyed the slightly electronic fighting music.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nNone are very creative, but I wouldn't go so far to call them bland or bad. They do what they are supposed to do, but you shouldn't expect any hidden depths (at least none you don't see coming from miles away). That little fox thingy as well as the boss exorcist were pretty annoying.\\n\r\n5/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjyoment:\\n\r\nI didn't mind that this anime is nothing special, I would have been okay with a generic shounen (which it is). That second plot about the impregnating however disgusted me, so much even that I decided to stop watching. If you can laugh about something like that and if you love shounen anime, this anime might be your cup of tea, but for anybody else, just stay away from it.\\n\r\n1/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n3.8/10",

            "content": "I loved this anime.... AT FIRST.\r\nThen, the anime somehow managed to take a 180 spin and descend into crap.\r\nI was not as disappointed in the anime as some others who were waiting for it since the debut. However, i am saddened by the fact that it actually has the potential to grow into a great anime, but not only did it fail to meet expectations, it somehow spiralled downhill for nearly every episode after its glory. So let's get into the review then.\r\nStory: \r\nAs mentioned above, i loved it. The first arc of the series (15 episodes) was great! It wasn't fantastic of course, butit delivered on all basis of  a good show. The struggles of an MC with his traumatic past, and the tragedy that befell the female MC and her quest to find a loved one. Not to mention the twist of the plot that leaves audience gaping and wanting more. Everything was there, emotions, mystery, love, struggle, comedy. After the first arc though.... the producers and animators ruined it, RUINED IT. I still can't come to terms on how much of a downward fall it took. For starters, they added near meaningless episodes into the show. Episodes that don't even needed to be there. I get that they wanted those episodes for exposition sake, but it really is NOT. Some episodes were meant to give the audience a better understanding of the characters and sympathise with them, but it was rushed, on top of the emotions and story being FORCED, resulting in a wasted episode. Second, the MC don't even matter anymore! I will elaborate more on that below. Third, where is the story!? After the first arc, the story was near to non-existent. Not only did the first arc end on a cliffhanger (only returning near the last 10 episodes), the second arc starts throwing in random short plot lines just in convenience to the story, making viewers really really bored with the plot. It only get better near the end, but even then, they decided to throw in everything at once, to resolve it in 1/5 of the series. All in all, i really couldn't sense anything good after the first arc, apart from some fight scenes and a tolerable ep 40 to 50. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nOne of the only 2 things that put this show on tolerable level. Even though the story deteriorated, the animation style is something to admire and stays consistent throughout the show. You rarely see an anime with such a unique style that complements each scene and the point they were trying to show correctly. For example: A scratchy blurry background was used to portray flashbacks. Every time a character attacks, an animation of the attack move is shown in vivid colours. This adds so much to aid a show that sometimes has to face bland coloured environment such as Magano.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe other thing that helps the show rise. What's really discerning about the music is not the OP and ED, but the soundtrack. You wouldn't normally associate a hot beat when looking at the words exorcist. But the OST can convince you otherwise, serving to elevate the fight scene to exciting levels.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\r\nNow, THIS IS THE MAIN REASON FOR TWIN STAR'S DOWNFALL. There is so much wrong with the characters no paragraph can fully cover it. I'm gonna try. The biggest problem with the character lies in poor handling. Many shows, if not most shows, have a large roster of characters. However, not many of these shows can correctly handle all of them without it going out of control or losing one or two characters to bad development. Sousei no Onmyouji managed to kill all of them. One of the reason the first arc was a big success was because they only had to work with a small roster. Since the second arc however, the show tried to introduce loads of characters and ended up screwing all their character traits, making most of them annoying and hated. They even tried working around the large roster by making every new character possess a distinct personality, e.g loudmouth, cheapskate, happy go lucky and rock singing. In contrast to making them more memorable, it made the characters go full fledged annoying. What's worse is that they even tried enhancing their character background with flimsy flashbacks and lousy relations and connections to one another, hoping to make the characters more lovable. What this actually does is sacrifice the MC screen time for little to no char development for the whole remaining of the show. One char even had no ties to the story at all!!! ABSOLUTELY NONE! And yet the animators dedicated an entire episode for her, just to add in the romance. In the long run, none of the characters made even an impression on the viewer, making the last episode's scramble of emotions moot. I am really disappointed at this lack of care since a lot of the characters are potentially lovable and have good base traits along with stylish fighting skills. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: First arc, yeah. After that, no. Maybe a little bit for the endgame.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: If you really loved the trailer and want to watch it, then by all means. However, i recommend viewers to only watch the first 15 ep, then skip all the way to episode 34 or 35? (i can't remember). You really aren't missing much. It might even be the saving grace for your love for this anime if you cut off the middle part.",

Example: Blue Exorcist, Nura Rise of the Yokai Clan.\r\nThat art is really good and the animation is nothing to sniff at, it is very visual and pleasing to watch, especially when it comes to the fighting sequences. \r\nThe story also starts off pretty well with introduction to the cast and also the slow progression into their backstory and current characterisations leading to interesting events which you are not confused/lost about. It gives you the sense of feeling for routeing for the characters as youcan understand their struggles and imagine yourself in their shoes.\\n\\n\r\nHowever after hitting around Episode 25, the series started to dull on me. The story just felt \"off\" compared to the previous half and almost felt rushed, characters suddenly know tons of \"Special Moves\" and start throwing them out non-stop as if they are nothing. \\n\\n\r\nThat wasn't the case for the first half and I later learnt that after around Episode 20 the anime series goes into full Filler mode with original content made specifically for the anime only. This explained the weird feeling i felt as you can definitely see the change in Tone and Progression.\\n\\n\r\nIt is a decent Shonen series however i prefer the first 20 episodes and think i will delve into the manga more instead. In my opinion, they would of been better off at ending after the first half and wait to make a second season that could stay closer to the original manga series.\\n\\n\r\nNote: If you do not read manga and only watch anime, you should have a much better time with this series than i did as it is not bad, just nothing special.\\n\\n\r\nThis would be a 6/10 for me as i feel it just lacks in the second half.",

            "content": "To be honest, I came across this anime by chance. I didn't expect to enjoy it as much! And before anyone comes out and boos me for not having a good taste in anime, I have watched SEVERAL good ones like Hyouka, Noragami, Mob Psycho 100, Boku no Hero Academia, Little Witch Academia, Kill la Kill, that anime with the guy in the pink hair that's psychic and many MANY more. This show is honestly pretty enjoyable. \r\nStory:\r\nI'd say it's not as gripping as other stories from other animes but, nonetheless I still enjoy it. As to my knowledge, the manga kind of differs fromthe anime itself and I think the ending is a lot different too and there are other characters in the manga. The anime itself is about 70% its own story. There's not much of a plot and it's kind of predictable (usual hero and heroine trying to get stronger together bla bla bla). But I'd have to say, the ending did have a plot twist (I won't say much but it got more exciting towards the last few episodes)\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI like how vivid the artwork is and how the difference between the Megano World where the Kegare lived and the human world differs. The scenes where they fight aren't as good as other shounen series but I'd still give it a good B- for it.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nCan't really comment much on this. I like the openings of the series (they have quite a few throughout the show).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nI personally like the character relationships the best. The male MC gets the most attention for character development while the female MC takes a bit of a back seat somewhere towards the end (I think she took too much of a back seat though). \\n\\n\r\nI love the relationship growth between the two of them. Although not listed, it DOES have a romance genre to it. And it's not like other animes where there's a harem or multiple love interest and the guy or girl falls in love WAY too fast. In fact, the growth of the male MC and female MC's relationship is extremely well-paced. I never understood those animes where the girls would fall in love with the guy over just one or two instances (call me a non-romantic but I don't believe in love at first sight). You could see how they eventually started to need each other more and more, despite not liking the other at first. And about 3/4 into the series, they're like the Mum and Dad of the series because they're THAT cute of a couple and everyone just assumes they're already those old couples that's been together since forever (note they don't get together until the end even though they OBVIOUSLY love each other). \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and overall:\\n\r\nI'd say I place this anime in my Top 15. It's not as bad as some people say it is, so just give it a shot. \\n\\n\r\nTL:DR; You might like this anime if you're into shounen and romance (i don't know why romance isn't listed since it's basically 70% of the damn story)\\n",

            "content": "When I first heard that Sousei no Onmyouji was going to be adapted into an anime, I was overly excited because I have read the manga of it. But after watching the anime, it clearly strayed off the whole original story. Which to me was a great disappointment because what I was hoping to watch was an anime adaptation of the original source. To those who aren't sure whether to watch it or not, I would say don't waste your time on it, because there were sooooo many pointless episodes, side plots, and characters. Especially the relationship between Benio and Rokuro was overly dramatized inan unecessarry way compared to the manga. I would've been fine if the anime did stray away from the original source, in a better way than the original, or of the same greatness, however, it did not. The art style is definitely amazing, however, that seems to be the only same thing that came from the manga, besides the first couple episodes. Thus, don't waste your time watching it and instead read the manga or light novel. I have personally read the manga and I would give it a 10, as for the light novel, I have not read it yet, thus I do not know whether it is the same as the manga, but so far from what I have read from other reviews, I think they are the same, but don't take my word for it. However, it is most likely the same as the manga and better than the anime.",

I guess that's what you get if you haven't watching all the episodes.\r\nAnd finally I manage to watched the whole 50 episodes. What would Isay? I really feel soooo much regret after writing negative review for this anime. In my first review, i thought episode 14 - 20 were just some random filler but after I watched the whole episodes, almost all episode -which i thought some filler- have a BIG part for the last arc. If you just started watching this anime I suggest you to keep it up, sometimes you will thinking \"why don't they just introduce all the 12 guardians in less episodes?\", but, just keep going guys.\\n\\n\r\nCONTAIN SOME SPOILER\\n\r\nSome plot twist are predictable, such as that Mikage guy being the Seimei himself, but it's not losing its value to be a plot twist.\\n\\n\r\nRokuro vs Yuto, guys.. that \"super saiya\" form of Rokuro is so badass. that form gives Rokuro an enormous energy even greater than full powered Yuto form. \\n\r\nThe real reason behind why did Yuto always challenging Rokuro also unpredictable and this is where the story become dark and sad at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe it is just me? but I feel like the last arc more like Naruto-ist, also Seimei have the same peace-world-ideal as Kaguya.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally the last 2 episodes, that was the finest ending I have ever watched.

            "content": "Alright I have seen very many horrible reviews but TRUST ME ON THIS, the anime is NOT as bad as those are saying. I would also agree that it is not that great, but it does have its good points. \r\nCONTAINS SPOILERS, READ AT YOUR OWN RISK!\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\nSTORY\r\n6/10\r\nI have not read the manga, and I do not want to judge this based on the manga, so I will give an honest review with this one. The story writers seemed like they were struggling, and the anime story severely dragged around the middle episodes. I admit that the story was going well until around episode 22, thenit started going all over the place. But in the end, that all-over-the-place story was used as a \"the power of comrades\" excuse in the end. However it wasn't as bad as it seemed and it actually made sense because it was backed up with \"plot evidence.\" So I let that slide, and I also like how the director played with the audience minds in the very end and showed us some side character development rather than a sudden \"Bleachified\" timeskip ending. All in all I didn't really enjoy sitting through weeks of episodes right after the drawn out Sae arc either, but the end brought back what was lacking just a little bit.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART\\n\\n\r\n7/10\\n\r\nConsidering the studio was Pierrot, I was actually expecting some screw-ups, but it looks like they cared more about this anime than they did for Naruto. There is some evidence here and there of obvious budget cuts but it isn't all that bad; but it's not amazing either. I rather enjoyed watching the \"resonance\" scenes, though; those kept me wanting to see more pretty pink sparkles lol\\n\r\nother than that, the animation was relatively consistent throughout the entire anime as opposed to Naruto where you could tell where all the budget cuts were in the episodes where the character shading got shitty. Nothing like that happened in this anime, but sometimes the special effects were botched.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\n6/10\\n\r\nFirst: music. I enjoyed the soundtrack more than how the sound was edited in the anime. Mikio Endo, the composer, definitely has some potential to go very far in his musical career. ALSO: openings and endings. I really have mixed feelings for these. I disliked all the endings except the first one, really. But I liked 2 out of the 4 openings, opening 1 and 3. Opening 2 was just meh, probably because of the choice of band they used. I also didn't particularly feel interested with the \"Naruto-style\" opening 4, it just reminded me too much of easily skip-able Naruto openings with mediocre bands doing their best to get on par with the \"hip\" bands of today. (sorry, Naruto lovers, I do like Naruto too but I dislike the boring openings and endings). \\n\r\nOpening 1 was DEFINITELY the best opening of the series, and actually quite possibly one of the best openings I have seen out of the hundreds of anime I have watched, which is fairly surprising. I also really liked opening 3 because of the relaxed but pumping feeling that the song gave off, especially at the part where the characters turned into puppets. (props to Tomohisa Taguchi)\\n\\n\r\nSecond: sfx and overall audio quality. It seems like the videos' bitrates were severely low even though the videos were in \"1080p\" HD and you could hear the audio quality waning a bit, distracting for perfectionists, lol. Also, sometimes the soundtrack just drained out the voice actors. It reminded me of \"Yona of the Dawn\" and honestly that was the number one reason why I dropped that anime; because the soundtrack drowned out the actors. It was terrible experience for me lol\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\\n\r\n4/10\\n\r\nMeh... that's really all I have to say. So what I didn't like the most was that both Rokuro and Benio's characters were too close to the stereotypical \"hero's journey\" heroes. (refer to Natsu and Lucy for stereotypical hero's journey characters) Although it seems like the \"main character\" turned into Rokuro Enmado, which made me a little mad that they neglected Benio Adashino since the writers gave her all that potential then threw in a trait that turned her into a lame duck character in 2 minutes. (refer to episode 46) Honestly the story focused mainly on those 2 and whenever side characters' received attention, there was attention on the WRONG side characters. Don't get me wrong, the obnoxious screamy girl (whose name escapes me) in the Heavenly Commanders was actually a decent character but why did we need background on her instead of a more significant character like Simon or the strongest exorcist with the red hair? It made absolutely no sense to me at all right there. However I do like how the Basara were given character backgrounds. Though it just reminded me too much of \"Bleach.\" Obvious inspiration.\\n\\n\r\nBUT\\n\\n\r\nI am not reluctant to say that I enjoy how both Rokuro and Benio's characters turned out in the end. I could not clearly see the moment when all seemed lost as well as the \"triumph\".. those were a little unclear. Rokuro went from flirtatious dousche bag in episode 1 to fairly badass and cute in the last few episodes, but that was not enough to patch up the vague missing important character traits like his attitudes towards his friends. All we got was some \"Fairy Tail\" comrade thing, so even the characters with a little bit of development were not the characters that needed it. Also I like how Benio's character developed much more-so than Rokuro. She went from complete tsundere in episode 1 to adorably bashful in episode 50. It was remarkable how her character was developed.\\n\r\nNow as for the villains... all I really hated was Yuto Ijika and Kuranashi. After what thousand years of planning, Kuranashi is what, defeated by some kid with no real reason for wanting to destroy the world? Total BS asspull \"plot patch.\" It was good that they gave him a reason to be jealous of Benio since he wasn't her, but it was ridiculous to make him so.. empty. He clearly did not have enough background to make his character appealing. Neither did filler-villain Kuranashi, which really was unnecessary.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\n7/10\\n\r\nAlright now.. for the reason why I stuck around with this anime. I got caught up around the airing of episode 36. So what was one of the best parts of this anime was the directing! A lot of people noticed that in the comments of various anime websites but were unsure what exactly it was that kept them watching this anime still. I enjoyed the pacing of romantic scenes as well as battles, but the surrounding \"filler\" during the long battles such as other character fights made me bored. Also the story points of Rokuro and Benio constantly failing until the very end to defeat their enemies without being OP was distracting, and made me bored as well. (gg story writers) HOWEVER I fully enjoyed the romance scenes and camera shots. Must just be the shoujo love in me, but every time they got close or blushed or came close to kissing or kissed, I got some butterflies and warm feelings and almost felt what the characters were feeling. Props to Tomohisa Taguchi! But it sucks that he is always paired with bad writers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nMy ratings actually are pretty spread out, but I'll give it overall a 6 out of 10. I would not say this anime was mediocre because there was clearly something that kept me watching, and I would say that was thanks to the well done directing by Tomohisa Taguchi, but what ALMOST made me drop it was thanks to Naruhisa Arakawa's poor story-telling at the most important parts of the story and dragging of key arcs; and also characters that were unnecessarily given background without it actually being utilized (i.e. that loud heavenly commander girl with the old loli woman). Also poor villain background such as Yuto Ijika and Kuranashi almost made me drop, but luckily Abe no Seimei was an OK villain (probably because he reminded me of Kagura. definitely was inspired by Naruto). All in all, NOT on the top of my \"recommendations\" list if you like anime with a fluid storyline. But I would definitely recommend it still (probably becasue of the fangirl in me) for the music (Mikio Endo), art, and enjoyment.\\n",

The story as far as I've seen is nothing special. It's not particularly interesting but is okay for burning time if you have a lot to spend.\r\nArt: Mediocre. Characters seem too 2 dimensional. I'm aware that we are watching through a screen but would it kill them to make the characters not look like cardboard cut outs?\r\nSound: Not repulsive but not great either. Background music was lame. Fight music was good. Opening song was not particularly great.\r\nCharacter:MC has deep scars that he has to overcome. Female protagonist seems to want to stand as his equal which is better than most animes now-a-days. The story progression so far indicates that there will be some small amount of character growth. The reason this gets a Fair is that the background characters are have little individual personality of their own. Its easy to lump the MCs roomates together as \"roomates\".\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Traditional ecchi humor combined with other comedic moments and regular fight scenes makes me give this somewhat enjoyable.",
