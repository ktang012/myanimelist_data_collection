            "content": "The Law of Ueki\r\nThis anime starts pretty weak. When you first walk into The Law of Ueki, there's not really anything to pull you in. It's a shounen anime. Ok, sweet, shounen I can get in the mood for shounen. So what's the main character able to do? Turn trash into trees. Awesome! wait what. He can turn trash into..... trees...\r\nThat's pretty much what The Law of Ueki will hit you with. However, that's what turns this anime into something so brilliant.\r\n--Story--\r\nYou've read the synopsis so let's cut to the chase. The story in The Law of Ueki is definitely not its strongest point. Asfar as shounens go, The Law of Ueki is ahead of its competitors. Ueki strives towards his goals one step at a time, while meeting characters who ultimately he befriends. Stick in some backstory for the characters and you have the formula that The Law of Ueki pretty much adheres to.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the actual plot, I would give it a 8. It's interesting, because even God has a backstory in this anime. Although the story does take a bit of a dive in the middle, and never really fully recovers. Other aspects of the anime (I.E. the battles, which is what Shounen is pretty much about) more than make up for it.\\n\\n\r\n--Art/Animation--\\n\r\nThere's not much to comment about. Everything is done as it should be. The Law of Ueki isn't an anime that's going to wow you with its visuals. Nor is it an anime\\n\r\nthat you can't bear to watch because your eyes are bleeding. The anime doesn't cut any corners, and battles are animated to what they need to be. There's no\\n\r\nslow-mo hi-def sword battles in this one. But that's really not something The Law of Ueki should even be judged on.\\n\\n\r\n--Music--\\n\r\nThe music is simply great. It's basically your daily allotment of Jpop But of course, does it contribute to the anime? I would say yes. Some\\n\r\nof the fights and situations in the anime really get you pumped because of the added music, and that's what I believe a 8/9 under music should do for you.\\n\r\nClearly The Law of Ueki is no Yoko Kanno composition, but hey it gets the job done and it gets it done very well.\\n\\n\\n\r\n--Characters--\\n\r\nThe strong point of the anime is right here. At first, Ueki seems kind of empty actually. However, over time Ueki begins to really become that\\n\r\ncharacter you root for. Sometimes his \"justice\" oversteps the line and you simply facepalm or headdesk, but thats a rare occurance.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are well developed, because their backstories are superb.Each character becomes unique and well defined while all contributing\\n\r\nto the overall enjoyment of the show. Even the character I hated the most (Saru) had his good moments. Although a part of me wanted a little more\\n\r\n\"interaction\" between Ueki and Mori, alas it was not to be. \\n\\n\r\nWhat's the best about the characters in The Law of Ueki, is that the anime also pays attention to the villains. Although they clearly aren't given\\n\r\nas much attention as the main heroes, The Law of Ueki really nails it by giving them just the right amount of attention. It's not a 1 minute \"blah blah blah\\n\r\nthis is why he hates Ueki/wants to win/hates person X/wants to destroy the world\" nor is it an episode dedicated to a character who ends up writen off in the recap\\n\r\ntime of the net episode. \\n\\n\r\n--Overall--\\n\r\nOverall The Law of Ueki is a superb shounen. The creativity behind the battles makes it a very enjoyable watch just because you think\\n\r\n\"Well how is he gonna get out of this one?\" That question isn't simply answered by \"OH MY GOD HE HAS ASCENDED AND HE'S KICKIN ASS!\" There's actually thought behind each battle, and that's what differentiates the average shounen from the great shounen.\\n",

            "content": "___________________________________________ Review the 6th\r\nChihuahua Review(short&sweet): This is a good shounen(bunch of guys and action) to watch. There are alot of unique characters. Let me rephrase that there are a lot of UNIQUE powers here.\r\n------------------------------>In Depth Review:<------------------------\r\nSTORY: This is not, I repeat NOT just some lame, generic kid show. The story here is a for spot to become God. Here angels become god-candidates who choose kids to give powers to and then let them battle. The main character Ueki who believes deeply in justice. This may still sound lame and generic but the story execution was great with fun interesting strategies in every battle. The onlyreal problem is parts of the story didnt make sense. 200 abilities for one person and only 100losers so far(you'll understand later). \\n\\n\r\nART: Animation was well and the battles really drawn exceptionally well adding to the fights intensity. However at times the main characters look really young and it was really hard to take them seriously during dramatic moments. It does becomes unnoticeable with the addictive story.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: The opening and endings were REALLY good in this one and the background music was passable. The voice acting was great here with the infamous Paku, Romi playing the main Ueki. Guess that's why I thought of Full Metal Alchemist while I was watching this.  \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: The characters here were really well made and there were alot and after watching it, I doubt there will be a character that youll end up hating. So many powers(trash into trees, towels to steel, etc.) they're so weird but u cant not like them.&gt;_&lt; The powers even get stronger. \\n\\n\r\nENJOIMENT: I couldn't stop watching this when i started it was so addicting I always wanted to find out wat happend next. Everything blended so well! Very close to being a nine overall. Ending was nice and really hope there is a second season(heard rumors). \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: No matter how generic this anime sounds it is good and definately worth a watch. Even though everything about it is not that great, the execution was amazing.\\n\\n\r\nRecommendation: If you like shounens with a dash of fantasy and magic watch this. If you like this then watch the Prince of Tennis or Full Metal Alchemist.^_^\\n\\n\r\nIf you dissagreed OR agreed fully with me on anything feel free to message me and discuss it. Always fun. @_@\\n\\n\r\nWoofWoof",

            "content": "Following a recommendation on hunter x hunter 2011, I ended up at The law of ueki, and after watching all the 52 eps, this is what I felt : it has a cliche plot, cliche side characters, cliche mc, cliche setting of a tournament, cliche concept,.......and yet.........non cliche powers, different style of fighting, outright comedy, and\u00a0 cool character roles.(i shall clear the difference between characters, and their role in character part)\r\nThe story is based on a knock out tournament (a popular tag which few even classify as a genre of its own) and a final prize for the winner. This concept has been overused likethe chunin exam of naruto, or hunter exam of hxh, or a recent example mirai nikki. Yet the execution is entirely different and unique in its own way. The story goes on like this- there are 100 god candidates chosen, and each candidate chooses a student (a middle school student) and gives him a power, and then the students fight between themselves, and whoever wins his candidate becomes the god, and the student gains a null talent, ie any talent he wishes. Moreover if a candidates student attacks a normal citizen the student loses one of his talents, and if they loose all their talents they will vanish without a trace. That is basically the initial setting. It becomes more intense as the show goes on. The few interesting points are the powers of the candidates, like MC has ability to turn trash into trees, another guy can turn towel into iron (looks lame at first, but it is splendidly used).\\n\\n\r\nAnimation 7/10 Sound 8/10\\n\r\nAnimation is weak, but considering it to be a 2005-2006 anime it is not some exception. It gets it job done. The characters designs are pretty good, though it had room for improvement. No kinds of scenery or stuff is present to comment upon, but animation shouldn't become a barrier to watching this splendid shounen anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound was better than the animation. The opening song gave a peculiar vibe of some kind of depressing situation, but it was not much pronounced in the anime, probably due to its excess comedy. The osts were pretty good, and there doesn't exist much to complain about.\\n\\n\r\nStory 8/10\\n\r\nTournament battles are overused stuff. And the existence of a decent prize is not an exception. And obviously there exists some kind of powerful antagonist with his own perception of talents and stuff. On a broader view there isn't anything pulling us into the story, but on close examination there exists plenty of elements. First, is the MC, Ueki. He is shown to have a strong sense of justice, and much of the story evolves around the justice factor. Second, is its excess comedy, which was initially used to propel the viewer into watching more ep, and in latter eps, just as a medium to keep the story strong. Comedy is one of its strongest points, (caution : don't drink water while watching this, else water will be spilled.). Third, is MCs peculiar power trash into trees and the possibilities that arise from. Fourth, and the most important is INTELLIGENT BATTLES. This is its strongest points, it delivers incredible battles. Battles are planned, and luckily the MC can actually think on his own and uses many tricks to baffle his opponents. Once 15 or so eps, pass MC also levels up, in very very interesting ways, as such once past 10 eps, there will be little incentive left to give up this anime. The anime also delves into teacher student relationship, and values of morals.\\n\\n\r\nBut still, the story lacks many things. First, the initial pace is slow, it is ok with manga but in anime adaptation, they could have cut quite many chapters and may be they could finish the anime sweetly in 35-40 episodes. The chapters I am referring to are not too integral in the story development, and plays very partial role in character development. In fact, the first few episodes were boring, and focused only on MC, and as result few important characters got introduced as late as ep 20. The anime should have neatly deleted unimportant battles. Even in the latter half some battles seemed to be dragged on. And only final battle remained to be seen.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9/10\\n\r\nWhile characters are mostly typical of shounen animes, their roles are quite varied and unique. There doesn't exist a character who is powerless at first sight but then after intensive training becomes op. The charcters develop, become better but only according to their capacities. Starting with MC he pretty much masters his powers, and his development his most pronounced. His leveling up is extraordinary, and he uses his new powers very intelligently and there are many spontaneous combos which he uses to defeat his enemies, and at times I was forced to say Brilliant! Other characters like Mori, rinko and Sano play integral role, and they too level up with unexpected variations. They receive ample development mainly because of solid back stories. The characters are carefully chosen by the author and he has intelligently played with them and the role that everyone plays is incredible. (If I were to elucidate it would be a spoiler).\\n\r\nInterestingly, even god is a character and surprisingly has a backstory. Tbh I was quite amazed at the description of the god, and more interestingly he is a prominent source of outright comedy\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\r\nI srsly enjoyed this anime, mainly because of highly intelligent battles, and some of the battles might even rival that of hxh. I was also amazed at the non cliche powers, among all I liked the antagonists power the most (can't spoil). The outright comedy was evident and there exists no episode which won't make u laugh. Added to this was powering up of the characters which added spice to the anime. Lastly and the most important part, that it has a good and actual ending, and not some lame original ending.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nEven then there exists many points to be criticized. First, irregular pacing, and dragged on battles. Second some cliche elements like nakama powerboost and some friendship stuff. Third, excess comedy, which at times turned into forced comedy. Fourth and the most important part is that it deals with MIDDLE SCHOOL kids. The anime had vast potentials, and with highschool students and a bit of seinen feel, packed with awesome action scenes and intelligent battles could have turned out better in many respects, because the idea of middle school kids fighting didn't really appeal to me much. Fifth, teacher student relationship was quite pronounced but again seemed to be a bit of excessive.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\r\nOn subjective reviewing it deserves 9/10, but on close inspection and objective reviewing I can't render more than. 8/10. As such the anime should have lasted not more than 35 eps, with fast pacing and appropriate development. Had it acccomplished this feat, it might have become a showcase masterpiece and shared its stage with other good animes.",

            "content": "I've come to realize that with all the newest animes coming out recently, there are still others that people seem to have forgotten, that or they've never heard of any of these shows. I'm talking about the kind of animes that are really good and underrated, but seem to have slipped under the radar.\r\nThe Law of Ueki, is one of those shows.\r\nPlot:\r\nGod has created a tournament, called the battle of the supernatural powers, to decide who will take his place as the ruler of heaven. All 100 god candidates must pick a middle school student, give him/her a strange, yet unique power, and act astheir fighter. The winning candidate will become the new god and the fighter will receive the talent of blank, which will give him/her whatever talent he/she wants. However, there are people who want the talent of blank for their own greedy and selfish desires. Enter our hero, Kousuke Ueki, who only wants to compete in the tournament to protect both his friends and the talent of blank with his power to turn trash into trees.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is a shonen anime which means it'll have cliches, fillers, over a 100 episodes, and a plot that soon goes nowhere halfway through the show. Here's the thing though:\\n\\n\r\nIt doesn't!\\n\\n\r\nThe show is very unique in it's way to take whatever cliches most shonen anime seem to have, and execute them in a way that makes the show barely boring at all! It does have a rather odd and bizarre look to it all, but that's the nature of the show. Credit should go to the director, Hiroshi Watanabe, for making the show hyperactive and zany for one moment, action-packed and intense the next ( usually at the same time ), and sad and dramatic when needed.\\n\\n\r\nArt/animation:\\n\r\nStudio DEEN did a good job on the show. While not lush and slick as most action shows, it's still decent and very above average. It's bright and colorful and the fights are still entertaining to watch and visually pleasing. The character designs will remind you of shows of Zash Bell, but they're not too bad.\\n\\n\r\nMusic:\\n\r\nAll the ops and eds are nice and good to listen to. The rest of the music is decent and passable.\\n\\n\r\nVoice-acting:\\n\r\nJapanese: excellent! The show has an all star cast of seiyuus (romi paku, tomoko kawakami, mamiko noto, kappei yamaguchi, jun fukuyama, souichiro hoshi, etc.) and they all did a nice job playing their roles.\\n\\n\r\nEnglish: terrible, just plain bad! The voices for the characters were painful to the ears and the acting was just dreadful! There were some that were ok, but it's really not enough to save the whole dub.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nProbably the strongest part of the show. All the characters are given a great amount of depth and development as well as backstory to why they wanted to fight. No matter how major or minor anyone in the show is, you'll just end up rooting for them as they struggle to be want they want to be, even the bad guys are hard to resist!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall:\\n\r\nWhat I said has already been said, the law of ueki is a show that shouldn't be missed by anyone, wether a shonen fan, action fan, or anime fan in general it doesn't matter. As stated earlier, this is an anime that slipped past under the radar without anyone knowing of it and deserves the full viewing it deserves. I had a blast watching it, I'm gald I watched it to begin with, and I hope others out there will to.\\n\\n\r\nIf you liked this review, feel free to comment me, if you didn't liked it tell me and i'll understand.\\n\r\n Later",

            "content": "Most action shows gives a group of people some of the coolest most destructive powers ever imagined. Cutting huge boulders with a sword, blowing stuff up with their mind, shooting laserbeams from their eyes, and so on. \u201cThe Law of Ueki\u201d decided to go in a different direction. It decided to give a bunch of people some useless powers, throw them together and see what happens.  \r\nIt took me about 5 minutes into the first episode to figure out this show wasn't going to have the greatest plot ever. The whole show is just a glorified tournament. The way the show explains all therules is a girl arbitrarily stumbles across some one using their power and so someone decides to just explain everything in depth to her for what really comes down to no good reason. In short the new king for the celestial world is going to be picked. Every candidate can select a middle school student from earth to fight for them and give them 1 power. Then they all fight until one wins. At least the show gives a reason why the fate of the world is in the hands of a bunch of school children.\\n\\n\r\nEven though it isn't a spectacular story it isn't all bad. The show did manage to throw a few plot twists in that genuinely surprised me, and I found very enjoyable. However no matter how you rap it up the show can't change the fact that the story is just an excuse to string together a bunch of fights.\\n\\n\r\nWhat could possibly be the most interesting thing about this tournament is the powers people get. There is the power to turn trash into trees, towels into iron, and electricity into sugar. The powers are kind of like \u201cI guess I could see how that might be useful in some way possibly\u201d, but the power aren't exactly my first pick material. There some other more practical powers like that power to turn beads into bombs or rings into rockets. Even these power aren't \u201cI can blow stuff up with my mind\u201d good. As odd as it might sound these powers are actually the thing that makes to show enjoyable. People end up coming up with some very creative ways of using these powers. There is also a limiting factor to powers. If someone can figure out someone else's limiting factor that will give them a great advantage. Seeing characters come up with strategies with seemingly useless powers is the best part of the show.\\n\\n\r\nUeki the main character and Mori the female lead easily stand out as the strongest characters in the show. These 2 actually have some development to them and even though the clueless hero and the bossy damsel in distress has been done before I still found them fun to watch. In second is Ueki's teammates that join him along they way. They all have decent enough personalities although it maybe a little bit on the quirky side. There will be more then a few \u201cI am going to fight for my friends\u201d type of speeches, but  I found I ended up caring about all of them by the time the show finishes. They may not get the same treatment as Ueki and Mori, but they all get their moment in the sun. If nothing else they are good for a few laughs. Lastly there is the numerous amount of opponents. A lot are just there so that a fight can happen, but some do get a sappy back story. During the fight they will somehow see the error of their ways. Even the main enemy is fairly thin. It my not be a 5 star cast but at the end of the day they managed to made me smile.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a show that is only going to appeal to action fans. I wouldn't consider the story or characters bad but I have a hard time seeing anyone go through 51 episodes of this show just to see how the story plays out or what happens to the characters. The fights themselves are quite interesting. I can honestly say I have never seen many of the powers in the show and will probably never see them again. Most importantly a lot of interesting uses of these powers will keep you guessing what will happen next.",

(Now even more show expand on it such as To aru Series, Book of Bantora etc)\r\nFirst impression...  Not good...  Thanks to the title...  I mean, who would wanna watch something with the title \"The Law of Ueki\"...  I would suggest find a better name.\r\nBut after recomended by a few people, I'm enter the world of Ueki.  But once I start watching...  It is absolutely AWESOME!!!  Come on...  Pretty original on the storyline...  But like allfighting anime, you can guess the outcome...  Hero (Ueki) meets a bad ass player...  Fight...  Loses...  Fight again with insane power... win. However, you would never even imagine the fight can turn out this way...  Plot is kinda predictable, yet unpredictable...  Contrast huh?\\n\\n\r\nBack to the character plotline \"I want to protect everybody\" is once again the popular tagline for this anime.  However, it kinda sux when the hero, who potentially protect everyone have the power to turn \"trash into trees\".  Come on!!!\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, you will see the hero later obtain insane powers...  Because he is the sone of a \"Heavenly Beings\"...  Now that made a comeback.  Then again, it is SO UNFAIR for the other players...\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, if you are a shounen lover...  Like to experiance some unpredictable plot, this is the anime for you!!!  \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "The law of ueki is a very unique anime. The general story is that in order to choose the next god, the god candidates select their preferred human and grants them very strange powers. Ex, the power to turn trash into tress, the power to turn your hair into a bat, the power change a ring into a rocket....etc. The anime starts out very basic with no depth to it, although as you get deeper into the anime, the story takes some really interesting turns. It truly does get better. And please note that watching the SUBBED or DUBBED version makes a very big difference.Meaning that i watched the DUBBED episode till about 35 and it was really horrible, the SUBBED version made me enjoy the anime better believe it or not.If it helps any the main character is voiced by the same person that voices Hitsugaya Toushiro from bleach(japanese). The theme of this anime over emphasizes the importance of friendship and bonds, which i found to be a little irritating. The characters were ok, nothing overly special about them and the anime as a whole was pretty hilarious. The action scenes are very similar to that or gash bell although the scenes in gash bell are a whole lot better. Anyways i thought the powers in the anime, although unique, very extremely lame. However the did get a little better as you go further into the anime. So in conclusion, if you have time to spare with nothing to do and absolutely no anime to watch or your into the whole strong bonds and friendship thing or your looking for a funny anime to watch, give the law of ueki a try.",

            "content": "I just finished watching this anime the night before I wrote this and I can say, this is probably the most underrated anime I've watched. Seriously why isn't this anime more popular.\r\nFirst of all, the plot. Before I watched this, I actually thought it was going to be a slice of life anime cause I actually watched it on a bootleg DVD and the front cover looked like a slice of life. It was not what I thought, it's a fricken battle to be god or somtin like that. Well basically it's a competition between middle schoolers who are each appointed by god candidates tofight each other. Each person is given a random power to use to fight the other people. There's also these skills called zai that give people certain talents that might be useful in battle. If your'e wondering, \"why do these middle schoolers compete in this tournament.\" The winner of the tournament will be able to obtain the null zai which is a zai you can choose. Another thing about zais is if you attack a person who ain't in the tournament with your powers, you loose a zai, and if you loose all your zai, you disappear. There are a lot of things to keep in mind about the plot, but mostly it's just another plot like future diary or the fate series where you compete in a survival game, tournament, etc. and if you win, you obtain something or get a high position.\\n\\n\r\nNext is the characters and there are a lotta them. Actually even though there are a lotta characters, most of them don't really make comebacks. Well I should start out with the mainies. First there is Ueki, or a dumber version of Shirou Emiya. Ueki is basically just another hero of justice. Next is Mori who is a friend of Ueki who isn't in the tournament until later in the anime. The last three are Sano, Rinko, and Hideyoshi. Sano reminds me of Ryoga Habiki from Ranma 1/2(probably cause they look the same). Rinko is my favorite glasses girl who likes cute things. Hideyoshi is pretty useless, but he's funny (he also looks like diddy kong). Most of the other characters are just people who fight Ueki and gets beaten. I think the producers did a pretty good job cause each of them have their own personality and backstory(well not all of them, but a lot). There are a lotta backstories and they were all pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nI want to talk about the action next cause it's different than the action I see in other shounens I watch. It doesn't just rely on just loud sound effects and yelling, but most of these battles have the characters trying to think a step ahead of the enemies. If you watched this, you'll see that the characters seem to be trapped in a bad situation, but then, oh they set up a trap or did something else to get an advantage. The action is different, but it's still really good.\\n\\n\r\nIf I were to say something bad about this anime, it probably is the main villain, Anon. I thought Robert Haydn was a much better villain, until he got swallowed by the real main villain. The reason why I don't like him is his actions don't really go with his motivations and it kinda doesn't make sense. The art style wasn't that great either, but it ain't bad. I watched this anime subbed even though I'm a dub fan, and I still really enjoyed it. I ain't like one of those anime fans who watch all their anime sub or all of it dubbed. I watch both, but I prefer dub cause it's easier on the ears and also multitasking is annoying, but the sub for Law of Ueki was alright.\\n\\n\r\nSo generally, yeah go watch it. It has plenty of action, lots of backstories, a good sense of humor, and a lot of characters. It also doesn't have all that tit grabbing, panty shots, and other perverted cliches in modern anime. Law of Ueki should get more attention cause it's a golden gem. SAO can die in a butthole(I actually don't hate SAO, but Law of Ueki is so much better) and Law of Ueki should take its place. Watch it, or you'll be missin out.",

The students face off (or run like chickens) and anyone who receives a K.O. is eliminated. The last one standing wins. What do they win? Does that really matter? It turns out it does, as the winner of this Game of Thrones will gain power. Power used irresponsibly will lead to chaos.\\n\\n\r\n\u267dArt/Sound\u267d\\n\r\nI will leave this to your interpretation. It was done well enough that your eyes and ears won't bleed. Remember to sit well away from the monitor and keep the room bright. And your entrances and exits secure. Don't wake up your neighbors because of how excited you're while viewing.\\n\\n\r\n\u267dEnjoyment\u267d\\n\r\nFukuchi's first published serialization is a great one. I've rewatched this anime entirely at least 3 times. It got me into manga, although its sequel, Law of Ueki+, really is just purasu. It wouldn't even be good as an OVA. 1 season is outstandingly enough as is. This is the most isekai-but-not-really animu I've seen thus far in my \"career.\"\\n\\n\r\n\u267dCharacters\u267d\\n\r\nEvery character is so well-developed with a background that doesn't lead to their death straight afterward. Rather, there are no deaths. Death-free show!\\n\r\nGod: I'm in awe of his sunglasses. I know of no other character whose sunglasses bear such a beautiful meaning.\\n\r\nKobayashi: Coolest teacher ever.\\n\r\nTenko: Look at him. What color is he? Yellow? Wrong. Any \"yellow\" displayed on your screen is fake. Your brain is being deceived. If you saw it as many bunched red and green pixels, you'd be like a color blind person seeing color for the first time.\\n\r\nUeki: Someone who cleans trash and plants trees. What a nice guy.\\n\r\nSano: ONSEN!!\\n\r\nMori: She is a kind-hearted girl who cares for her friends. In battle, she is powerless. A lot of people show their ire for how useless she is. It's not about how useful friends are. These people would probably use the blank zai for evil. That goes against my righteousness. Come here, I will fight you!?\\n\\n\r\n\u267dA Few Lessons\u267d\\n\r\n-True friends are friends you are willing to risk to protect, and true friendship is mutual. There is such a thing as one-sided love, but not one-sided friendship.\\n\r\n-Everyone has at least 1 talent. A savant skill lying dormant.\\n\r\n-Never give up. Hard work>Talent, although you may never become as \"good.\" It is something you strive for. Tradeoffs and strengthened areas (advantages) from disadvantages... Luck doesn't exist in anime. Luck may exist in the finding of an idea or boom in wealth, fame, and power; everything in films is predetermined and the fate and destiny of the characters is in the hands of the puppet master.\\n\r\n-There is no reason needed to save someone.\\n\\n\r\nIn the eleventh hour...\\n\r\nWhen it comes to watching anime, ask yourself this: if today is my last day on Earth, should I be watching anime? YES\\n\r\nShould it be Law of Ueki? yes (not capitalized)\\n\r\nRated 10 **********ing stars in every category. 10\u00f710=1",

            "content": "The Law of Ueki is the story of several young teenagers with super powers who are fighting in a competition to gain great power. The competition starts with one on one battles but shifts to group battles for the second round, but there's a problem. There's a competitor who wants the power to wipe out humanity. You know, this plot sounds very familiar, almost like I've seen something with an identical story, but where was that... \r\nI remember, it was Shaman King. \r\nBe honest, you all saw that coming. The underlying plots really are almost identical. The only major differences are that Shaman King's tournamenthad competitors of all ages and the competitors in The Law of Ueki can lose their abilities but those aren't really significant changes. Hell, even the plot twist toward the end, which I won't reveal in the interest of avoiding spoilers, is the same. To be fair, the Law of Ueki does have some legitimately funny moments, but that doesn't make up for the fact that its plot borders on plagiaristic. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters aren't much better. They all have personalities based around common shounen anime tropes, which they play straight. The result is that they feel like very stock, listless characters. Another issue is that the main antagonist's motivations, when they're fully revealed at the end, don't match his actions. Which results a distinct impression that the writer changed his character at the last minute.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is decent. It isn't spectacular but it's not bad either. Although they do resort to borked proportions in a few cases. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice work is actually very well done. Oddly enough, the Law of Ueki has a lot of the same vocal talent as Shaman King. The music is mostly good. The only issue is that some of it doesn't suit the anime. Causing a disconnect between the feel of the action and the feel of the music.\\n\\n\r\nThe yuri factor is a 2/10. Mori and Rinko have some moments that seem a little homoerotic but there really aren't many. \\n\\n\r\nMy final rating for The Law of Ueki is a 5/10. It's average. The biggest issue it has is that it's simply too standard to stand out on its own. Everything it does with its story and characters has been done before and better. In the end it's an average shounen anime that plays it safe. If you're a fan of shounen anime, Shaman King especially, you'll probably enjoy it. Just don't expect anything new.",

            "content": "After finishing some rather big shounen series and looking for something new to pick up, preferably something under 70 episodes, I found The Law of Ueki. \r\nStory(7): \r\nThis series is a tournament type anime, and the story is nothing unexpected. You can tell, for the most part, where it is going right off the bat. Now that's not to say it's boring, the series did have a solid story line that kept me interested, plus the series has a definite ending(wrapping up after 51E). Although I do feel your enjoyment has to do with weather you like this type of series and weather you likethe characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters(8): \\n\r\nOne thing I love about shows like this is the variety of characters, each with their own personalities and quirks. Which is what The Law of Ueki gives. The show gives us 5(6 if you count Tenko) unique main characters, as well as a huge variety of other characters(most of which come up in fights). Each of the main characters, as well as some of the antagonists, are given some sort of backstory so you can better understand their motivations and choices(love it when shows do that). After saying all that, I personally loved all the main characters and many of the side characters as well, which is one of the reasons I enjoyed this anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound(6): \\n\r\nThe voice actors of all the characters fit quite well and I didn't' have a problem with any of them(that is unless I forgot about them). I'm not even going to say much about the music in this anime as I don't remember anything but the opening(which I did like). \\n\\n\r\nArt(7) \\n\r\nI put this here in case you were wondering about the art, however, quite frankly I wasn't really paying attention to the art/animation of this series either while watching it. Although, I do remember the fighting scenes being animated well. All I can really say is that it worked for the series and the animation was done well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(9): \\n\r\nThis show is exactly the type of show I was looking for and exactly the type of show that I love. I thoroughly enjoyed it right up until the end. \\n\\n\r\nRecommend if you are looking for: \\n\r\n-Shounen \\n\r\n-Shounen that actually has an end(51 episodes) \\n\r\n-Variety of characters \\n\r\n-Something easy to get into  \\n\r\n-Something easy to follow \\n\r\n-Supernatural elements \\n\r\n-Fun characters\\n\r\n-A tournament anime \\n\\n\r\nThe best way to tell if this show is for you is to watch the first few episodes, once you get where the show is going decide if you want to drop.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "The Law of Ueki is one of those anime series that I can easily relate when recommending it. Someone asks me what it's about, and first I tell them \"it's about a kid who can turn trash into trees\", but I make sure to tell them at some point, \"it's like Shaman King, but with a killer environmental message!\"\r\nOne of the first real anime I got into was Shaman King. And to find Shaman King reincarnated as this modern anime (though probably not intentionally so) really caught my attention.\r\nI mean consider the similarities. They're both about kids with powers who are trying to compete inthis competition against other kids with powers so as to win the ability to have whatever they want to be so. Yoh wanted to be Shaman King. Ueki wants the talent of blank. Even the start of the series is the same. Ai Mori is basically the anima of Manta Oyamada, as both of them try to nose into the business of the story's protagonist and find them out and expose them for who they are. Likewise both become friends with the story's protagonist and try to help them. It's such a literal translation I can barely begin to describe. \\n\\n\r\nThus whenever I recommend Law of Ueki I always call it 'Shaman King with a killer environmental message.' Copying isn't a bad thing; if nobody ever did anything that hadn't been done before nobody would ever do anything, ever.",

            "content": "Ok, this is my first review so don't expect a detailed review and also I do not look for reviews so I've got no preference and so it's very different from a normal review by a lot of users here. I've only heard this from a friend and said I should go check this out cause this is his favorite anime.\r\nFirst of all, The Law of Ueki is a very fun and exciting anime to watch even if you do not watched it while it is still progressing in Japan.\r\nStory (8/10)\r\nI think the story is simply linear. TRUE it is amazing but to me itis just a simple story about a high school boy(which to me is very common and I fully understand why) who was given power to compete which have the best power. I give it a 8 because of how the story progresses. It's hard to find an anime with an excellent story progression with just a very simple story.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7/10)\\n\r\nOk, do not curse me because I give it a 7 on art because it is a not-so-old anime. I gave it that rating because the Art is good but in a story like Law of Ueki where almost all episodes are battles, the art is to be excellent. I'm just disappointed when it doesn't leveling up as the story is going on but instead dropping down.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10)\\n\r\nThe sound is OK. But again, since it's purely based on fighting there should be a LOT of background music playing(although it is not popular in that year). As for being fair into my future reviews of latest animes, I will give it a 7.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9/10)\\n\r\nAlmost all of the characters here is used even if it's a minor character. But in the end, they fail to keep that habit going and instead putting in a lot more appearance of the major characters. I'm not saying that's bad though but because of that, i gave it 9 instead of 10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10)\\n\r\nI think enjoyment in Law of Ueki is pretty unique. Because aside from it's comedy, the battles here is what makes this fun and exciting. All battles are surprising because you don't know how will they win against another or who will win. I can't come up with any words anymore but one word is to be sure, EXCITING.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10)\\n\r\nOverall, Law of Ueki is a good anime to watch if you're looking for an anime in which you will not get bored of. But the rewatch value of this anime is very low since it's story progression is relying on battles and it's not that EXCITING anymore if you already know what will happen. That's why I'll give this an 8.\\n",

            "content": "[This review will focus on finding out if this anime is worth a shot for YOU]\r\n-----------------------------------------------------\r\nWHAT TO EXPECT:\r\n Basically, The Law of Ueki is nothing like the head-first Shounens out there: the powers included in this one are rather... weird, let's say, but VERY interesting nonetheless!\r\n What if you had the power to transform trash into trees? Or towels into iron? Well, I'm not giving more examples because that would spoil it a bit, but it's pretty easy to see where this is going.\r\n-----------------------------------------------------\r\nMAIN PLOT:\r\n The main plot is quite original! High school students get selected by Celestials (people who reside in \"Heaven\") to representthem in an all-out \"tournament\" by getting these special and hilarious powers. The one who wins gets to be the new \"God\" and the student who wins gets to choose ANY \"talent\" he wants, it could be anything, literally! Basically making a wish.\\n\\n\r\n But don't get fooled! The silly plot doesn't stop this show from having fights in literally 95% of the episodes (or more!), and with many MANY different AND UNIQUE concepts / types of powers getting presented as the show progresses, the excitement on each fight just keeps getting bigger!\\n\\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nWHY IT ISN'T PERFECT:\\n\\n\r\n The Law of Ueki simply didn't get a 9, or even a 10 from me because it still has all those clich\u00e9s as tropes from most shounen series, from the power of friendship giving you ridiculous power in the middle of a fight, or standing up even after taking a thousand hits from the strongest villain, but that CERTAINLY doesn't stop ANYONE from enjoying the CONTINUOUS thrill that The Law of Ueki provides!\\n\\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nFINAL PERSONAL VEREDICT / CHARACTERS:\\n\\n\r\nI'd say that The Law of Ueki is probably one of the most unique Shounen series out there, and DEFINITELY worth a shot for every fight lover! The powers are not brain-dead, yet they are silly and provide some great laughs!\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of characters isn't disappointing at all! The group of friends that is formed have all very very apparently weak and even more silly powers than other power-users in general, which makes the way the fights turn around to be very unexpected and interesting, to say the least!\\n\\n",

Perhaps not the most original in creation, it still managed to keep my attention throughout the lengthy 51 episode. \r\n7/10\r\nART\r\nThe Art was average at best. There was nothing particularly riveting in the style that managed to separate itself from the crowd but, at the same, time there was nothing to hold against it. A tad childish, I venture to describe it as \u2018typically shounen\u2019.\r\n6/10\r\nSOUND\r\nThe voices were well cast and thesound effects and music fit in nicely with the flow. I found it easy to listen to and not stressful to my hearing, I especially entertained myself by recognizing the voices and pinning them to other similar characters they've voice - for example, the voice actor of Hideyoshi also voices Usopp from One Piece.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: \\n\r\nThe 51 episodes flew by before I knew it and I found the ending to be satisfying. Although, the final arc itself annoyed me a little as it felt messy, rushed and a tad unfinished. Also, if you're holding out for an epic final battle between Ueki and Robert prepare to be disappointed as I was.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\r\nThe law of Ueki has just the right amount of twists and turns to keep you satisfied and is worth a watch if you can manage to suffer through the first few confusing introductory episodes.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoy!\\n",

The characters are pretty cool, the story is pulls you in, the ending is mind blowing, and this anime is just too short.  Definitely an anime to check out.  This might sound super cheesy, and I am serious, but Ueki is going to be an amazing figureto watch throughout all of this.

            "content": "The Law of Ueki\r\nThis anime starts pretty weak. When you first walk into The Law of Ueki, there's not really anything to pull you in. It's a shounen anime. Ok, sweet, shounen I can get in the mood for shounen. So what's the main character able to do? Turn trash into trees. Awesome! wait what. He can turn trash into..... trees...\r\nThat's pretty much what The Law of Ueki will hit you with. However, that's what turns this anime into something so brilliant.\r\n--Story--\r\nYou've read the synopsis so let's cut to the chase. The story in The Law of Ueki is definitely not its strongest point. Asfar as shounens go, The Law of Ueki is ahead of its competitors. Ueki strives towards his goals one step at a time, while meeting characters who ultimately he befriends. Stick in some backstory for the characters and you have the formula that The Law of Ueki pretty much adheres to.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the actual plot, I would give it a 8. It's interesting, because even God has a backstory in this anime. Although the story does take a bit of a dive in the middle, and never really fully recovers. Other aspects of the anime (I.E. the battles, which is what Shounen is pretty much about) more than make up for it.\\n\\n\r\n--Art/Animation--\\n\r\nThere's not much to comment about. Everything is done as it should be. The Law of Ueki isn't an anime that's going to wow you with its visuals. Nor is it an anime\\n\r\nthat you can't bear to watch because your eyes are bleeding. The anime doesn't cut any corners, and battles are animated to what they need to be. There's no\\n\r\nslow-mo hi-def sword battles in this one. But that's really not something The Law of Ueki should even be judged on.\\n\\n\r\n--Music--\\n\r\nThe music is simply great. It's basically your daily allotment of Jpop But of course, does it contribute to the anime? I would say yes. Some\\n\r\nof the fights and situations in the anime really get you pumped because of the added music, and that's what I believe a 8/9 under music should do for you.\\n\r\nClearly The Law of Ueki is no Yoko Kanno composition, but hey it gets the job done and it gets it done very well.\\n\\n\\n\r\n--Characters--\\n\r\nThe strong point of the anime is right here. At first, Ueki seems kind of empty actually. However, over time Ueki begins to really become that\\n\r\ncharacter you root for. Sometimes his \"justice\" oversteps the line and you simply facepalm or headdesk, but thats a rare occurance.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are well developed, because their backstories are superb.Each character becomes unique and well defined while all contributing\\n\r\nto the overall enjoyment of the show. Even the character I hated the most (Saru) had his good moments. Although a part of me wanted a little more\\n\r\n\"interaction\" between Ueki and Mori, alas it was not to be. \\n\\n\r\nWhat's the best about the characters in The Law of Ueki, is that the anime also pays attention to the villains. Although they clearly aren't given\\n\r\nas much attention as the main heroes, The Law of Ueki really nails it by giving them just the right amount of attention. It's not a 1 minute \"blah blah blah\\n\r\nthis is why he hates Ueki/wants to win/hates person X/wants to destroy the world\" nor is it an episode dedicated to a character who ends up writen off in the recap\\n\r\ntime of the net episode. \\n\\n\r\n--Overall--\\n\r\nOverall The Law of Ueki is a superb shounen. The creativity behind the battles makes it a very enjoyable watch just because you think\\n\r\n\"Well how is he gonna get out of this one?\" That question isn't simply answered by \"OH MY GOD HE HAS ASCENDED AND HE'S KICKIN ASS!\" There's actually thought behind each battle, and that's what differentiates the average shounen from the great shounen.\\n",

            "content": "___________________________________________ Review the 6th\r\nChihuahua Review(short&sweet): This is a good shounen(bunch of guys and action) to watch. There are alot of unique characters. Let me rephrase that there are a lot of UNIQUE powers here.\r\n------------------------------>In Depth Review:<------------------------\r\nSTORY: This is not, I repeat NOT just some lame, generic kid show. The story here is a for spot to become God. Here angels become god-candidates who choose kids to give powers to and then let them battle. The main character Ueki who believes deeply in justice. This may still sound lame and generic but the story execution was great with fun interesting strategies in every battle. The onlyreal problem is parts of the story didnt make sense. 200 abilities for one person and only 100losers so far(you'll understand later). \\n\\n\r\nART: Animation was well and the battles really drawn exceptionally well adding to the fights intensity. However at times the main characters look really young and it was really hard to take them seriously during dramatic moments. It does becomes unnoticeable with the addictive story.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: The opening and endings were REALLY good in this one and the background music was passable. The voice acting was great here with the infamous Paku, Romi playing the main Ueki. Guess that's why I thought of Full Metal Alchemist while I was watching this.  \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: The characters here were really well made and there were alot and after watching it, I doubt there will be a character that youll end up hating. So many powers(trash into trees, towels to steel, etc.) they're so weird but u cant not like them.&gt;_&lt; The powers even get stronger. \\n\\n\r\nENJOIMENT: I couldn't stop watching this when i started it was so addicting I always wanted to find out wat happend next. Everything blended so well! Very close to being a nine overall. Ending was nice and really hope there is a second season(heard rumors). \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: No matter how generic this anime sounds it is good and definately worth a watch. Even though everything about it is not that great, the execution was amazing.\\n\\n\r\nRecommendation: If you like shounens with a dash of fantasy and magic watch this. If you like this then watch the Prince of Tennis or Full Metal Alchemist.^_^\\n\\n\r\nIf you dissagreed OR agreed fully with me on anything feel free to message me and discuss it. Always fun. @_@\\n\\n\r\nWoofWoof",

            "content": "Following a recommendation on hunter x hunter 2011, I ended up at The law of ueki, and after watching all the 52 eps, this is what I felt : it has a cliche plot, cliche side characters, cliche mc, cliche setting of a tournament, cliche concept,.......and yet.........non cliche powers, different style of fighting, outright comedy, and\u00a0 cool character roles.(i shall clear the difference between characters, and their role in character part)\r\nThe story is based on a knock out tournament (a popular tag which few even classify as a genre of its own) and a final prize for the winner. This concept has been overused likethe chunin exam of naruto, or hunter exam of hxh, or a recent example mirai nikki. Yet the execution is entirely different and unique in its own way. The story goes on like this- there are 100 god candidates chosen, and each candidate chooses a student (a middle school student) and gives him a power, and then the students fight between themselves, and whoever wins his candidate becomes the god, and the student gains a null talent, ie any talent he wishes. Moreover if a candidates student attacks a normal citizen the student loses one of his talents, and if they loose all their talents they will vanish without a trace. That is basically the initial setting. It becomes more intense as the show goes on. The few interesting points are the powers of the candidates, like MC has ability to turn trash into trees, another guy can turn towel into iron (looks lame at first, but it is splendidly used).\\n\\n\r\nAnimation 7/10 Sound 8/10\\n\r\nAnimation is weak, but considering it to be a 2005-2006 anime it is not some exception. It gets it job done. The characters designs are pretty good, though it had room for improvement. No kinds of scenery or stuff is present to comment upon, but animation shouldn't become a barrier to watching this splendid shounen anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound was better than the animation. The opening song gave a peculiar vibe of some kind of depressing situation, but it was not much pronounced in the anime, probably due to its excess comedy. The osts were pretty good, and there doesn't exist much to complain about.\\n\\n\r\nStory 8/10\\n\r\nTournament battles are overused stuff. And the existence of a decent prize is not an exception. And obviously there exists some kind of powerful antagonist with his own perception of talents and stuff. On a broader view there isn't anything pulling us into the story, but on close examination there exists plenty of elements. First, is the MC, Ueki. He is shown to have a strong sense of justice, and much of the story evolves around the justice factor. Second, is its excess comedy, which was initially used to propel the viewer into watching more ep, and in latter eps, just as a medium to keep the story strong. Comedy is one of its strongest points, (caution : don't drink water while watching this, else water will be spilled.). Third, is MCs peculiar power trash into trees and the possibilities that arise from. Fourth, and the most important is INTELLIGENT BATTLES. This is its strongest points, it delivers incredible battles. Battles are planned, and luckily the MC can actually think on his own and uses many tricks to baffle his opponents. Once 15 or so eps, pass MC also levels up, in very very interesting ways, as such once past 10 eps, there will be little incentive left to give up this anime. The anime also delves into teacher student relationship, and values of morals.\\n\\n\r\nBut still, the story lacks many things. First, the initial pace is slow, it is ok with manga but in anime adaptation, they could have cut quite many chapters and may be they could finish the anime sweetly in 35-40 episodes. The chapters I am referring to are not too integral in the story development, and plays very partial role in character development. In fact, the first few episodes were boring, and focused only on MC, and as result few important characters got introduced as late as ep 20. The anime should have neatly deleted unimportant battles. Even in the latter half some battles seemed to be dragged on. And only final battle remained to be seen.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9/10\\n\r\nWhile characters are mostly typical of shounen animes, their roles are quite varied and unique. There doesn't exist a character who is powerless at first sight but then after intensive training becomes op. The charcters develop, become better but only according to their capacities. Starting with MC he pretty much masters his powers, and his development his most pronounced. His leveling up is extraordinary, and he uses his new powers very intelligently and there are many spontaneous combos which he uses to defeat his enemies, and at times I was forced to say Brilliant! Other characters like Mori, rinko and Sano play integral role, and they too level up with unexpected variations. They receive ample development mainly because of solid back stories. The characters are carefully chosen by the author and he has intelligently played with them and the role that everyone plays is incredible. (If I were to elucidate it would be a spoiler).\\n\r\nInterestingly, even god is a character and surprisingly has a backstory. Tbh I was quite amazed at the description of the god, and more interestingly he is a prominent source of outright comedy\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\r\nI srsly enjoyed this anime, mainly because of highly intelligent battles, and some of the battles might even rival that of hxh. I was also amazed at the non cliche powers, among all I liked the antagonists power the most (can't spoil). The outright comedy was evident and there exists no episode which won't make u laugh. Added to this was powering up of the characters which added spice to the anime. Lastly and the most important part, that it has a good and actual ending, and not some lame original ending.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nEven then there exists many points to be criticized. First, irregular pacing, and dragged on battles. Second some cliche elements like nakama powerboost and some friendship stuff. Third, excess comedy, which at times turned into forced comedy. Fourth and the most important part is that it deals with MIDDLE SCHOOL kids. The anime had vast potentials, and with highschool students and a bit of seinen feel, packed with awesome action scenes and intelligent battles could have turned out better in many respects, because the idea of middle school kids fighting didn't really appeal to me much. Fifth, teacher student relationship was quite pronounced but again seemed to be a bit of excessive.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\r\nOn subjective reviewing it deserves 9/10, but on close inspection and objective reviewing I can't render more than. 8/10. As such the anime should have lasted not more than 35 eps, with fast pacing and appropriate development. Had it acccomplished this feat, it might have become a showcase masterpiece and shared its stage with other good animes.",

            "content": "I've come to realize that with all the newest animes coming out recently, there are still others that people seem to have forgotten, that or they've never heard of any of these shows. I'm talking about the kind of animes that are really good and underrated, but seem to have slipped under the radar.\r\nThe Law of Ueki, is one of those shows.\r\nPlot:\r\nGod has created a tournament, called the battle of the supernatural powers, to decide who will take his place as the ruler of heaven. All 100 god candidates must pick a middle school student, give him/her a strange, yet unique power, and act astheir fighter. The winning candidate will become the new god and the fighter will receive the talent of blank, which will give him/her whatever talent he/she wants. However, there are people who want the talent of blank for their own greedy and selfish desires. Enter our hero, Kousuke Ueki, who only wants to compete in the tournament to protect both his friends and the talent of blank with his power to turn trash into trees.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is a shonen anime which means it'll have cliches, fillers, over a 100 episodes, and a plot that soon goes nowhere halfway through the show. Here's the thing though:\\n\\n\r\nIt doesn't!\\n\\n\r\nThe show is very unique in it's way to take whatever cliches most shonen anime seem to have, and execute them in a way that makes the show barely boring at all! It does have a rather odd and bizarre look to it all, but that's the nature of the show. Credit should go to the director, Hiroshi Watanabe, for making the show hyperactive and zany for one moment, action-packed and intense the next ( usually at the same time ), and sad and dramatic when needed.\\n\\n\r\nArt/animation:\\n\r\nStudio DEEN did a good job on the show. While not lush and slick as most action shows, it's still decent and very above average. It's bright and colorful and the fights are still entertaining to watch and visually pleasing. The character designs will remind you of shows of Zash Bell, but they're not too bad.\\n\\n\r\nMusic:\\n\r\nAll the ops and eds are nice and good to listen to. The rest of the music is decent and passable.\\n\\n\r\nVoice-acting:\\n\r\nJapanese: excellent! The show has an all star cast of seiyuus (romi paku, tomoko kawakami, mamiko noto, kappei yamaguchi, jun fukuyama, souichiro hoshi, etc.) and they all did a nice job playing their roles.\\n\\n\r\nEnglish: terrible, just plain bad! The voices for the characters were painful to the ears and the acting was just dreadful! There were some that were ok, but it's really not enough to save the whole dub.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nProbably the strongest part of the show. All the characters are given a great amount of depth and development as well as backstory to why they wanted to fight. No matter how major or minor anyone in the show is, you'll just end up rooting for them as they struggle to be want they want to be, even the bad guys are hard to resist!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall:\\n\r\nWhat I said has already been said, the law of ueki is a show that shouldn't be missed by anyone, wether a shonen fan, action fan, or anime fan in general it doesn't matter. As stated earlier, this is an anime that slipped past under the radar without anyone knowing of it and deserves the full viewing it deserves. I had a blast watching it, I'm gald I watched it to begin with, and I hope others out there will to.\\n\\n\r\nIf you liked this review, feel free to comment me, if you didn't liked it tell me and i'll understand.\\n\r\n Later",

            "content": "Most action shows gives a group of people some of the coolest most destructive powers ever imagined. Cutting huge boulders with a sword, blowing stuff up with their mind, shooting laserbeams from their eyes, and so on. \u201cThe Law of Ueki\u201d decided to go in a different direction. It decided to give a bunch of people some useless powers, throw them together and see what happens.  \r\nIt took me about 5 minutes into the first episode to figure out this show wasn't going to have the greatest plot ever. The whole show is just a glorified tournament. The way the show explains all therules is a girl arbitrarily stumbles across some one using their power and so someone decides to just explain everything in depth to her for what really comes down to no good reason. In short the new king for the celestial world is going to be picked. Every candidate can select a middle school student from earth to fight for them and give them 1 power. Then they all fight until one wins. At least the show gives a reason why the fate of the world is in the hands of a bunch of school children.\\n\\n\r\nEven though it isn't a spectacular story it isn't all bad. The show did manage to throw a few plot twists in that genuinely surprised me, and I found very enjoyable. However no matter how you rap it up the show can't change the fact that the story is just an excuse to string together a bunch of fights.\\n\\n\r\nWhat could possibly be the most interesting thing about this tournament is the powers people get. There is the power to turn trash into trees, towels into iron, and electricity into sugar. The powers are kind of like \u201cI guess I could see how that might be useful in some way possibly\u201d, but the power aren't exactly my first pick material. There some other more practical powers like that power to turn beads into bombs or rings into rockets. Even these power aren't \u201cI can blow stuff up with my mind\u201d good. As odd as it might sound these powers are actually the thing that makes to show enjoyable. People end up coming up with some very creative ways of using these powers. There is also a limiting factor to powers. If someone can figure out someone else's limiting factor that will give them a great advantage. Seeing characters come up with strategies with seemingly useless powers is the best part of the show.\\n\\n\r\nUeki the main character and Mori the female lead easily stand out as the strongest characters in the show. These 2 actually have some development to them and even though the clueless hero and the bossy damsel in distress has been done before I still found them fun to watch. In second is Ueki's teammates that join him along they way. They all have decent enough personalities although it maybe a little bit on the quirky side. There will be more then a few \u201cI am going to fight for my friends\u201d type of speeches, but  I found I ended up caring about all of them by the time the show finishes. They may not get the same treatment as Ueki and Mori, but they all get their moment in the sun. If nothing else they are good for a few laughs. Lastly there is the numerous amount of opponents. A lot are just there so that a fight can happen, but some do get a sappy back story. During the fight they will somehow see the error of their ways. Even the main enemy is fairly thin. It my not be a 5 star cast but at the end of the day they managed to made me smile.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a show that is only going to appeal to action fans. I wouldn't consider the story or characters bad but I have a hard time seeing anyone go through 51 episodes of this show just to see how the story plays out or what happens to the characters. The fights themselves are quite interesting. I can honestly say I have never seen many of the powers in the show and will probably never see them again. Most importantly a lot of interesting uses of these powers will keep you guessing what will happen next.",

(Now even more show expand on it such as To aru Series, Book of Bantora etc)\r\nFirst impression...  Not good...  Thanks to the title...  I mean, who would wanna watch something with the title \"The Law of Ueki\"...  I would suggest find a better name.\r\nBut after recomended by a few people, I'm enter the world of Ueki.  But once I start watching...  It is absolutely AWESOME!!!  Come on...  Pretty original on the storyline...  But like allfighting anime, you can guess the outcome...  Hero (Ueki) meets a bad ass player...  Fight...  Loses...  Fight again with insane power... win. However, you would never even imagine the fight can turn out this way...  Plot is kinda predictable, yet unpredictable...  Contrast huh?\\n\\n\r\nBack to the character plotline \"I want to protect everybody\" is once again the popular tagline for this anime.  However, it kinda sux when the hero, who potentially protect everyone have the power to turn \"trash into trees\".  Come on!!!\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, you will see the hero later obtain insane powers...  Because he is the sone of a \"Heavenly Beings\"...  Now that made a comeback.  Then again, it is SO UNFAIR for the other players...\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, if you are a shounen lover...  Like to experiance some unpredictable plot, this is the anime for you!!!  \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "The law of ueki is a very unique anime. The general story is that in order to choose the next god, the god candidates select their preferred human and grants them very strange powers. Ex, the power to turn trash into tress, the power to turn your hair into a bat, the power change a ring into a rocket....etc. The anime starts out very basic with no depth to it, although as you get deeper into the anime, the story takes some really interesting turns. It truly does get better. And please note that watching the SUBBED or DUBBED version makes a very big difference.Meaning that i watched the DUBBED episode till about 35 and it was really horrible, the SUBBED version made me enjoy the anime better believe it or not.If it helps any the main character is voiced by the same person that voices Hitsugaya Toushiro from bleach(japanese). The theme of this anime over emphasizes the importance of friendship and bonds, which i found to be a little irritating. The characters were ok, nothing overly special about them and the anime as a whole was pretty hilarious. The action scenes are very similar to that or gash bell although the scenes in gash bell are a whole lot better. Anyways i thought the powers in the anime, although unique, very extremely lame. However the did get a little better as you go further into the anime. So in conclusion, if you have time to spare with nothing to do and absolutely no anime to watch or your into the whole strong bonds and friendship thing or your looking for a funny anime to watch, give the law of ueki a try.",

            "content": "I just finished watching this anime the night before I wrote this and I can say, this is probably the most underrated anime I've watched. Seriously why isn't this anime more popular.\r\nFirst of all, the plot. Before I watched this, I actually thought it was going to be a slice of life anime cause I actually watched it on a bootleg DVD and the front cover looked like a slice of life. It was not what I thought, it's a fricken battle to be god or somtin like that. Well basically it's a competition between middle schoolers who are each appointed by god candidates tofight each other. Each person is given a random power to use to fight the other people. There's also these skills called zai that give people certain talents that might be useful in battle. If your'e wondering, \"why do these middle schoolers compete in this tournament.\" The winner of the tournament will be able to obtain the null zai which is a zai you can choose. Another thing about zais is if you attack a person who ain't in the tournament with your powers, you loose a zai, and if you loose all your zai, you disappear. There are a lot of things to keep in mind about the plot, but mostly it's just another plot like future diary or the fate series where you compete in a survival game, tournament, etc. and if you win, you obtain something or get a high position.\\n\\n\r\nNext is the characters and there are a lotta them. Actually even though there are a lotta characters, most of them don't really make comebacks. Well I should start out with the mainies. First there is Ueki, or a dumber version of Shirou Emiya. Ueki is basically just another hero of justice. Next is Mori who is a friend of Ueki who isn't in the tournament until later in the anime. The last three are Sano, Rinko, and Hideyoshi. Sano reminds me of Ryoga Habiki from Ranma 1/2(probably cause they look the same). Rinko is my favorite glasses girl who likes cute things. Hideyoshi is pretty useless, but he's funny (he also looks like diddy kong). Most of the other characters are just people who fight Ueki and gets beaten. I think the producers did a pretty good job cause each of them have their own personality and backstory(well not all of them, but a lot). There are a lotta backstories and they were all pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nI want to talk about the action next cause it's different than the action I see in other shounens I watch. It doesn't just rely on just loud sound effects and yelling, but most of these battles have the characters trying to think a step ahead of the enemies. If you watched this, you'll see that the characters seem to be trapped in a bad situation, but then, oh they set up a trap or did something else to get an advantage. The action is different, but it's still really good.\\n\\n\r\nIf I were to say something bad about this anime, it probably is the main villain, Anon. I thought Robert Haydn was a much better villain, until he got swallowed by the real main villain. The reason why I don't like him is his actions don't really go with his motivations and it kinda doesn't make sense. The art style wasn't that great either, but it ain't bad. I watched this anime subbed even though I'm a dub fan, and I still really enjoyed it. I ain't like one of those anime fans who watch all their anime sub or all of it dubbed. I watch both, but I prefer dub cause it's easier on the ears and also multitasking is annoying, but the sub for Law of Ueki was alright.\\n\\n\r\nSo generally, yeah go watch it. It has plenty of action, lots of backstories, a good sense of humor, and a lot of characters. It also doesn't have all that tit grabbing, panty shots, and other perverted cliches in modern anime. Law of Ueki should get more attention cause it's a golden gem. SAO can die in a butthole(I actually don't hate SAO, but Law of Ueki is so much better) and Law of Ueki should take its place. Watch it, or you'll be missin out.",

You can watch while eating together.\r\nThis review is intended for those who haven't seen and formed a first impression themselves. If you've already watched it, get out of here, dumb dummy! I'm kidding, please read. :c\r\nLet'sjump right into it!\\n\r\n\u267c\u267c\u267c\u267c\u267c\u267c\u267c\u267c\u267c\u267c\u267c\u267c\u267c\u267c\u267c\u267c\u267c\u267c\u267c\u267c\u267c\u267c\u267c\u267c\u267c\\n\r\n\u267dStory\u267d\\n\r\nGod is running a game to determine the next God.

The students face off (or run like chickens) and anyone who receives a K.O. is eliminated. The last one standing wins. What do they win? Does that really matter? It turns out it does, as the winner of this Game of Thrones will gain power. Power used irresponsibly will lead to chaos.\\n\\n\r\n\u267dArt/Sound\u267d\\n\r\nI will leave this to your interpretation. It was done well enough that your eyes and ears won't bleed. Remember to sit well away from the monitor and keep the room bright. And your entrances and exits secure. Don't wake up your neighbors because of how excited you're while viewing.\\n\\n\r\n\u267dEnjoyment\u267d\\n\r\nFukuchi's first published serialization is a great one. I've rewatched this anime entirely at least 3 times. It got me into manga, although its sequel, Law of Ueki+, really is just purasu. It wouldn't even be good as an OVA. 1 season is outstandingly enough as is. This is the most isekai-but-not-really animu I've seen thus far in my \"career.\"\\n\\n\r\n\u267dCharacters\u267d\\n\r\nEvery character is so well-developed with a background that doesn't lead to their death straight afterward. Rather, there are no deaths. Death-free show!\\n\r\nGod: I'm in awe of his sunglasses. I know of no other character whose sunglasses bear such a beautiful meaning.\\n\r\nKobayashi: Coolest teacher ever.\\n\r\nTenko: Look at him. What color is he? Yellow? Wrong. Any \"yellow\" displayed on your screen is fake. Your brain is being deceived. If you saw it as many bunched red and green pixels, you'd be like a color blind person seeing color for the first time.\\n\r\nUeki: Someone who cleans trash and plants trees. What a nice guy.\\n\r\nSano: ONSEN!!\\n\r\nMori: She is a kind-hearted girl who cares for her friends. In battle, she is powerless. A lot of people show their ire for how useless she is. It's not about how useful friends are. These people would probably use the blank zai for evil. That goes against my righteousness. Come here, I will fight you!?\\n\\n\r\n\u267dA Few Lessons\u267d\\n\r\n-True friends are friends you are willing to risk to protect, and true friendship is mutual. There is such a thing as one-sided love, but not one-sided friendship.\\n\r\n-Everyone has at least 1 talent. A savant skill lying dormant.\\n\r\n-Never give up. Hard work>Talent, although you may never become as \"good.\" It is something you strive for. Tradeoffs and strengthened areas (advantages) from disadvantages... Luck doesn't exist in anime. Luck may exist in the finding of an idea or boom in wealth, fame, and power; everything in films is predetermined and the fate and destiny of the characters is in the hands of the puppet master.\\n\r\n-There is no reason needed to save someone.\\n\\n\r\nIn the eleventh hour...\\n\r\nWhen it comes to watching anime, ask yourself this: if today is my last day on Earth, should I be watching anime? YES\\n\r\nShould it be Law of Ueki? yes (not capitalized)\\n\r\nRated 10 **********ing stars in every category. 10\u00f710=1",

            "content": "The Law of Ueki is the story of several young teenagers with super powers who are fighting in a competition to gain great power. The competition starts with one on one battles but shifts to group battles for the second round, but there's a problem. There's a competitor who wants the power to wipe out humanity. You know, this plot sounds very familiar, almost like I've seen something with an identical story, but where was that... \r\nI remember, it was Shaman King. \r\nBe honest, you all saw that coming. The underlying plots really are almost identical. The only major differences are that Shaman King's tournamenthad competitors of all ages and the competitors in The Law of Ueki can lose their abilities but those aren't really significant changes. Hell, even the plot twist toward the end, which I won't reveal in the interest of avoiding spoilers, is the same. To be fair, the Law of Ueki does have some legitimately funny moments, but that doesn't make up for the fact that its plot borders on plagiaristic. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters aren't much better. They all have personalities based around common shounen anime tropes, which they play straight. The result is that they feel like very stock, listless characters. Another issue is that the main antagonist's motivations, when they're fully revealed at the end, don't match his actions. Which results a distinct impression that the writer changed his character at the last minute.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is decent. It isn't spectacular but it's not bad either. Although they do resort to borked proportions in a few cases. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice work is actually very well done. Oddly enough, the Law of Ueki has a lot of the same vocal talent as Shaman King. The music is mostly good. The only issue is that some of it doesn't suit the anime. Causing a disconnect between the feel of the action and the feel of the music.\\n\\n\r\nThe yuri factor is a 2/10. Mori and Rinko have some moments that seem a little homoerotic but there really aren't many. \\n\\n\r\nMy final rating for The Law of Ueki is a 5/10. It's average. The biggest issue it has is that it's simply too standard to stand out on its own. Everything it does with its story and characters has been done before and better. In the end it's an average shounen anime that plays it safe. If you're a fan of shounen anime, Shaman King especially, you'll probably enjoy it. Just don't expect anything new.",

            "content": "After finishing some rather big shounen series and looking for something new to pick up, preferably something under 70 episodes, I found The Law of Ueki. \r\nStory(7): \r\nThis series is a tournament type anime, and the story is nothing unexpected. You can tell, for the most part, where it is going right off the bat. Now that's not to say it's boring, the series did have a solid story line that kept me interested, plus the series has a definite ending(wrapping up after 51E). Although I do feel your enjoyment has to do with weather you like this type of series and weather you likethe characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters(8): \\n\r\nOne thing I love about shows like this is the variety of characters, each with their own personalities and quirks. Which is what The Law of Ueki gives. The show gives us 5(6 if you count Tenko) unique main characters, as well as a huge variety of other characters(most of which come up in fights). Each of the main characters, as well as some of the antagonists, are given some sort of backstory so you can better understand their motivations and choices(love it when shows do that). After saying all that, I personally loved all the main characters and many of the side characters as well, which is one of the reasons I enjoyed this anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound(6): \\n\r\nThe voice actors of all the characters fit quite well and I didn't' have a problem with any of them(that is unless I forgot about them). I'm not even going to say much about the music in this anime as I don't remember anything but the opening(which I did like). \\n\\n\r\nArt(7) \\n\r\nI put this here in case you were wondering about the art, however, quite frankly I wasn't really paying attention to the art/animation of this series either while watching it. Although, I do remember the fighting scenes being animated well. All I can really say is that it worked for the series and the animation was done well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(9): \\n\r\nThis show is exactly the type of show I was looking for and exactly the type of show that I love. I thoroughly enjoyed it right up until the end. \\n\\n\r\nRecommend if you are looking for: \\n\r\n-Shounen \\n\r\n-Shounen that actually has an end(51 episodes) \\n\r\n-Variety of characters \\n\r\n-Something easy to get into  \\n\r\n-Something easy to follow \\n\r\n-Supernatural elements \\n\r\n-Fun characters\\n\r\n-A tournament anime \\n\\n\r\nThe best way to tell if this show is for you is to watch the first few episodes, once you get where the show is going decide if you want to drop.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "The Law of Ueki is one of those anime series that I can easily relate when recommending it. Someone asks me what it's about, and first I tell them \"it's about a kid who can turn trash into trees\", but I make sure to tell them at some point, \"it's like Shaman King, but with a killer environmental message!\"\r\nOne of the first real anime I got into was Shaman King. And to find Shaman King reincarnated as this modern anime (though probably not intentionally so) really caught my attention.\r\nI mean consider the similarities. They're both about kids with powers who are trying to compete inthis competition against other kids with powers so as to win the ability to have whatever they want to be so. Yoh wanted to be Shaman King. Ueki wants the talent of blank. Even the start of the series is the same. Ai Mori is basically the anima of Manta Oyamada, as both of them try to nose into the business of the story's protagonist and find them out and expose them for who they are. Likewise both become friends with the story's protagonist and try to help them. It's such a literal translation I can barely begin to describe. \\n\\n\r\nThus whenever I recommend Law of Ueki I always call it 'Shaman King with a killer environmental message.' Copying isn't a bad thing; if nobody ever did anything that hadn't been done before nobody would ever do anything, ever.",

The one thing that may cause problems is that the characters talk about the talents too much. It kinda feels like it's more about the talents than whose going to be the next ruler.

            "content": "Ok, this is my first review so don't expect a detailed review and also I do not look for reviews so I've got no preference and so it's very different from a normal review by a lot of users here. I've only heard this from a friend and said I should go check this out cause this is his favorite anime.\r\nFirst of all, The Law of Ueki is a very fun and exciting anime to watch even if you do not watched it while it is still progressing in Japan.\r\nStory (8/10)\r\nI think the story is simply linear. TRUE it is amazing but to me itis just a simple story about a high school boy(which to me is very common and I fully understand why) who was given power to compete which have the best power. I give it a 8 because of how the story progresses. It's hard to find an anime with an excellent story progression with just a very simple story.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7/10)\\n\r\nOk, do not curse me because I give it a 7 on art because it is a not-so-old anime. I gave it that rating because the Art is good but in a story like Law of Ueki where almost all episodes are battles, the art is to be excellent. I'm just disappointed when it doesn't leveling up as the story is going on but instead dropping down.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10)\\n\r\nThe sound is OK. But again, since it's purely based on fighting there should be a LOT of background music playing(although it is not popular in that year). As for being fair into my future reviews of latest animes, I will give it a 7.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9/10)\\n\r\nAlmost all of the characters here is used even if it's a minor character. But in the end, they fail to keep that habit going and instead putting in a lot more appearance of the major characters. I'm not saying that's bad though but because of that, i gave it 9 instead of 10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10)\\n\r\nI think enjoyment in Law of Ueki is pretty unique. Because aside from it's comedy, the battles here is what makes this fun and exciting. All battles are surprising because you don't know how will they win against another or who will win. I can't come up with any words anymore but one word is to be sure, EXCITING.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10)\\n\r\nOverall, Law of Ueki is a good anime to watch if you're looking for an anime in which you will not get bored of. But the rewatch value of this anime is very low since it's story progression is relying on battles and it's not that EXCITING anymore if you already know what will happen. That's why I'll give this an 8.\\n",

            "content": "[This review will focus on finding out if this anime is worth a shot for YOU]\r\n-----------------------------------------------------\r\nWHAT TO EXPECT:\r\n Basically, The Law of Ueki is nothing like the head-first Shounens out there: the powers included in this one are rather... weird, let's say, but VERY interesting nonetheless!\r\n What if you had the power to transform trash into trees? Or towels into iron? Well, I'm not giving more examples because that would spoil it a bit, but it's pretty easy to see where this is going.\r\n-----------------------------------------------------\r\nMAIN PLOT:\r\n The main plot is quite original! High school students get selected by Celestials (people who reside in \"Heaven\") to representthem in an all-out \"tournament\" by getting these special and hilarious powers. The one who wins gets to be the new \"God\" and the student who wins gets to choose ANY \"talent\" he wants, it could be anything, literally! Basically making a wish.\\n\\n\r\n But don't get fooled! The silly plot doesn't stop this show from having fights in literally 95% of the episodes (or more!), and with many MANY different AND UNIQUE concepts / types of powers getting presented as the show progresses, the excitement on each fight just keeps getting bigger!\\n\\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nWHY IT ISN'T PERFECT:\\n\\n\r\n The Law of Ueki simply didn't get a 9, or even a 10 from me because it still has all those clich\u00e9s as tropes from most shounen series, from the power of friendship giving you ridiculous power in the middle of a fight, or standing up even after taking a thousand hits from the strongest villain, but that CERTAINLY doesn't stop ANYONE from enjoying the CONTINUOUS thrill that The Law of Ueki provides!\\n\\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nFINAL PERSONAL VEREDICT / CHARACTERS:\\n\\n\r\nI'd say that The Law of Ueki is probably one of the most unique Shounen series out there, and DEFINITELY worth a shot for every fight lover! The powers are not brain-dead, yet they are silly and provide some great laughs!\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of characters isn't disappointing at all! The group of friends that is formed have all very very apparently weak and even more silly powers than other power-users in general, which makes the way the fights turn around to be very unexpected and interesting, to say the least!\\n\\n",

Perhaps not the most original in creation, it still managed to keep my attention throughout the lengthy 51 episode. \r\n7/10\r\nART\r\nThe Art was average at best. There was nothing particularly riveting in the style that managed to separate itself from the crowd but, at the same, time there was nothing to hold against it. A tad childish, I venture to describe it as \u2018typically shounen\u2019.\r\n6/10\r\nSOUND\r\nThe voices were well cast and thesound effects and music fit in nicely with the flow. I found it easy to listen to and not stressful to my hearing, I especially entertained myself by recognizing the voices and pinning them to other similar characters they've voice - for example, the voice actor of Hideyoshi also voices Usopp from One Piece.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: \\n\r\nThe 51 episodes flew by before I knew it and I found the ending to be satisfying. Although, the final arc itself annoyed me a little as it felt messy, rushed and a tad unfinished. Also, if you're holding out for an epic final battle between Ueki and Robert prepare to be disappointed as I was.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\r\nThe law of Ueki has just the right amount of twists and turns to keep you satisfied and is worth a watch if you can manage to suffer through the first few confusing introductory episodes.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoy!\\n",

The characters are pretty cool, the story is pulls you in, the ending is mind blowing, and this anime is just too short.  Definitely an anime to check out.  This might sound super cheesy, and I am serious, but Ueki is going to be an amazing figureto watch throughout all of this.

Its about a tournament where 100 heavenly beings each choose a middle school student and gives them an ability where all of them has to battle so they can win the zai ability which you can wish for any power or talent and your master would be the new god in heaven as well. There are three rounds in the tournament. \r\nArt:\r\nFights are one of the best but the animation is very old and low quality\r\nSound:\r\nOPS and EDS were amazing. The first opening really suits the anime\r\nCharacter:\r\nThe main character is a laid-back personthat believes deeply in his own justice. His ability is the ability to change trash into trees. The abilities are actually changing something onto another thing so don't be expecting canons from tits or water powers. NOPE!\\n\r\nSPOILER!!\\n\r\nLater on in the show you learn the character is actually a heavenly being or born in heaven so he is a lot more powerful the the other contestants. when being a heavenly being you get levels on how strong you are from level one to ten. each level you access a sacred weapon which are just really powerful weapons. \\n\\n\r\nKurogane(Level 1 sacred weapon)\\n\r\nIts a really large canon the main character pulls out of nowhere and shoots out huge ball like a normal canon\\n\\n\r\nFudo(Level 2 sacred weapon)\\n\r\nA huge fist from the ground in place as a defensive shield\\n\\n\r\nRanma (Level 3 sacred weapon)\\n\r\nA humongous knife/sword\\n\\n\r\nMashu(Level 4 sacred weapon)\\n\r\nA square smiley face from the ground crushing the opponent between the teeth\\n\\n\r\nPick(Level 5 sacred weapon)\\n\r\nA long rectangle pole to hit the attacker\\n\\n\r\nRaika(Level 6 sacred weapon)\\n\r\nA pair of brown skates the main character uses to run really fast\\n\\n\r\nGulliver(Level 7 sacred weapon)\\n\r\nA box on a green platform coming from the ground trapping the enemy\\n\\n\r\nNamihana(Level 8 sacred weapon)\\n\r\nA huge flexible whip to attack the enemy\\n\\n\r\nSeiku(Level 9 sacred weapon)\\n\r\nA pair of wings\\n\\n\r\nMoah(Level 10 sacred weapon)\\n\r\nThis weapon has no form but its a spirit I guess depending on the will of the user. (Ueki's moah is his master and his will is to protect his justice and friends.)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\n Fights were amazing and there were a lot as well\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nWATCH IT!!! it is amzing if you like my hero academia you will like this.

If your looking for decent anime to watch i'd recommend it.\r\nIf you like battle anime you will probably like this it's tournament based and has a pretty good concept to it which is fairly unique in terms of how they get powers and what thepowers do compared to other super power anime. \\n\\n\r\nIt's a bit like yu yu hakusho in term of the tournament element although the tournament itself is a bit different in the fact it's not a fixed location and the characters can be getting on with there daily lives while competing at least for the first half of the anime so if you enjoyed that you you will probably enjoy this.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "The law of ueki is a great anime. It's not revolutionary or anything and the story is basic but i enjoyed it. To say the truth i was sceptical at first because of it's length. I know 51 episodes isn't a huge number of episodes but i only watched anime with 12-26 episodes so the law of ueki wasn't in my top interests. Now i am happy that i watched it.\r\n(story) The story is about a kid called Ueki Kousuke. An normal high schooler that is picked by a god candicate? What is that? Well as the name says it's a candicate for a godand each candicate has to pick a highschool kid to fight for them. Ueki is one of those kids. Thankfully he is given a power to defend himself. What is that power you ask? Well he can change garbage to.........trees. Not and the most helpful power but ok. It's still better than nothing i suppose. Now ueki has to fight other highschoolers for his god candicate to become a god.\\n\\n\r\nAs i said the story isn't anything special. It's typical stuff and isn't really tempting, but the anime shines on other factors.\\n\\n\r\n(Characters) The characters is the best thingh about this anime. When a new character is introduced, it always has some characteristics about the. For example their class and what kind of food they like. The main character Ueki is also a common highschooler that eats a lot and doesn't care about anything to such an extent that it is funny. The friends he meet along the way are also amusing and funny at some parts, but since i don't want to spoil it i won't be mentioning them. \\n\\n\r\n(visuals) Visually it is great, as every anime should. It's colors are lively but it's like every other anime as i said.\\n\\n\r\n(Sound) Sound based it's good but again the same as ever. It's the common Sound effects but it has a fairly good soundtrack and 2 amazing opening songs. I listen to the opening songs almost every day.\\n\\n\r\n(enjoyment) The law of ueki is a funny anime with a lot of fighting, a lot of weird and unusual powers and a little bit of drama here and there.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend you watch it if you have some free time and you don't get bored of an anime quickly.",

            "content": "While scavenging the web for something to nourish my hunger for action oriented anime, I came across this little refreshment and picked it up. It\u2019s a shounen anime. Awesome! So what can the MC do? Turn trash into trees. Cool! Wait, what? He can turn trash\u2026.into\u2026.trees?! Yep, didn\u2019t read that wrong. \r\nThis is the first thing Law of Ueki hits you with. But albeit a weak start, the anime truly develops brilliantly. It\u2019s one of those anime which are either under-appreciated or forgotten. It\u2019s got a clich\u00e9d story (perhaps?), clich\u00e9d characters, clich\u00e9d mc, clich\u00e9d concept yet non clich\u00e9d powers, excellent fights and outright comedy. It\u2019sabout time to expand upon those features.\\n\\n\r\n-------------Story-------------\\n\\n\r\nThe story is pretty generic. The formula of including tournaments in battle shounen to declare a winner, popularized by Dragon Ball, found its way into countless shounen that followed; Law of Ueki is no exception. However, the execution here is done excellently. It\u2019s not just fighting out in an arena confined within large stands for viewers. Anyplace can become the battleground.\\n\r\nThe plot is that the celestial king, a Godlike mortal being, has to choose his successor, so instead of picking someone at random he chooses 100 king candidates, each of whom can choose a middle schooler human representative, give him/her a unique power and let them battle it out. The candidate whose representative wins will be the next king and the representative will receive the \u201cTalent of Blank\u201d, that is to say, any one talent s/he may desire. All power users have talents and whenever they use their power to hurt non-power users, one of their talents are gone; a person with zero talent ceases to exist and vanishes without a trace. Little do they know there are beings other than humans taking part in the battle. As the story progresses it starts to become a bit more interesting, and though somewhere halfway down the road it kinda becomes like a typical shounen tournament, the fights, which are what shounen are pretty much about, more than makes up for it. Aside from the serious plot, there\u2019s a lot of comedy in this series as well and they can make you laugh like an idiot; though that primarily depends on an individual\u2019s sense of humor. One more thing, don\u2019t expect any romance in this one. That factor is next to non-existent in this anime. But all in all, the plot is good and well executed.\\n\\n\r\n-------------Sound-------------\\n\\n\r\nThe music is great and complements the story well. The OST\u2019s really gets you pumped up in certain situations and of course in the fights. The voice actors did a very good job on their roles as well; I\u2019m talking about the dub by the way. The openings and endings are standard J-Pop tracks which are nice; just don\u2019t expect any \u201cUnravel\u201d or \u201cBrave Shine\u201d in this one, and you\u2019ll be fine.\\n\\n\r\n-------------Art/Animation-------------\\n\\n\r\nKeep in mind that this is an anime from 2005. Judging by that the animation/art style is very well done. It doesn\u2019t have overwhelmingly eye popping visuals like Fate/Stay Night UBW, but neither is it an anime you can\u2019t watch without your eyes bleeding. Given the timeframe, it\u2019s really pretty decent.\\n\\n\r\n-------------Characters-------------\\n\\n\r\nAaahh, now this is where Law of Ueki truly shines. The large cast of characters in the show are almost all likeable characters. Take our hero Ueki for example \u2013 he appears as hollow and empty at the beginning of the series, but as the story progresses his character becomes more and more appreciable. With a strong sense of \u201crighteousness\u201d, he\u2019ll throw himself to help just about anyone, friends, strangers, even enemies. Starting from zero, Ueki not only masters his potential but also learns to use them in a variety of cunning way. His battle ingenuity becomes more and more apparent and at times you can\u2019t refrain from saying \u201cbrilliant!!\u201d\u2026\u2026. unless you\u2019ve watched about 300 anime and nothing surprises you anymore, but that\u2019s an exception I suppose (and it probably means you\u2019ve seen this one already). And then we have Ai Mori who starts out as a straight-man comic relief but eventually becomes a much more important main character. Every character has substantial developments and great backstories, backstories that may seem foolish and childish but given most of them being experienced as a child, they hold up in a great manner. Protagonists, supporting characters, antagonists, and even the Celestial King has nice backstories which allow us to understand and sympathize with them. However the one bad thing about them is all the protagonists tend to use overly cheesy dialogues regarding \u201cfriendship\u201d and \u201cfighting for others\u201d; and this is true whether you\u2019re watching the subs or listening to the dubs. The portrayal of \u201crighteousness\u201d is strong with this one, a little too strong. Dialogues that remind you of \u201cfairy tail\u201d at times. It\u2019s about the only thing that annoyed me quite a bit. Nevertheless, in the end you end up liking most, if not all, of the characters shown in the series.\\n\\n\r\n-------------Fights and powers-------------\\n\\n\r\nThis isn\u2019t a section typically included in a review but I think this anime needs one anyway. There is a wide variety of unique powers in this anime, powers that can come off as really strange. Other than the MC\u2019s unique power, there\u2019s the power to change towels into Iron and power to shift your voice through portraits etc. Bottom-line, they are unique and there are a lot of them; kinda reminds of \u201cOne Piece\u201d in a way. However, there is a limiting condition to all the powers; meaning they can be used only if certain conditions are met.\\n\\n\r\nAs to the fights, they\u2026are\u2026.awesome! Trust me, the fight scenes are excellently done, and they\u2019re not just mindless battles. A lot of cunning, strategies, and on-spot tactics are present throughout the numerous fight scenes. No, there\u2019s no Hi-def slow-motion sword-fights in this one but seriously, that\u2019s not something you should even expect from Law of Ueki. And the predictability is somewhat less than your average shounen anime. There are times when you think something\u2019s gonna happen now, but it doesn\u2019t. Instead something happens unexpectedly later on, when you\u2019re not expecting it anymore. In any case, the fights truly live up to the expectations concerning a shounen.\\n\\n\r\n------------- Overall: 7.5+/10 -------------\\n\\n\r\nLaw of Ueki is a splendid shounen; the creativity behind the battles are what makes it even more enjoyable. Ueki, or anyone else in this anime for that matter, is no Natsu Dragneel who gets up, wipes his mouth and says \u201cI\u2019m gonna kick your ass\u201d, and then wins. No, it\u2019s not that simple. There are a lot of thoughts behind those fights. I would\u2019ve actually given it an 8 but those overly cheesy dialogues kinda made me tone down my scoring. Then again, a 7 would never justify this show as it would be unfairly low rating; even 7.5 might not cut it, hence the plus. As a fractional score can't be given here on MAL, I chose an 8 nevertheless. It\u2019s an anime I would definitely recommend to any shounen lovers.",

Since it's already finished and I think it's one of those underrated anime. For those who disagree, I respect your standards. I've been badly wanting to watch this. Okay, so much for my opinions. I like the plot because it already catches my attention how much more if you watch it. Right? I like the way the artist draws the emotions on the face of the characters. That one episode leaves that remarkable emotion for me. Argrhhh! If I say more that it will be spoiled.I really like the character of Ueki and his powers. Even Ai Mori the way she meddles with some things. I really enjoyed watching this anime the comedy acts, the unique powers and the friendship. For those who still did not watch it. I recommend you should watch it.",
