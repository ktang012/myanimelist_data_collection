            "content": "Sakurako-san is another one of those unfortunate anime which could potentially have been really good had it just done a few things differently, but instead sadly ends up fumbling upon itself thanks to a handful of slip-ups. It's quite similar to Hyouka as far as its theme and plot progression goes, but the pacing is significantly worse.\r\nThe story follows a normal high school boy named Shoutarou who has a not-so-normal friend called Sakurako. She has an unhealthy addiction to bones of all things, and finds it fascinating to study their history. By some strange coincidence, whenever the two of them are together they just sohappen to get themselves accidentally involved in numerous bizarre cases, usually where a corpse or a skeleton is found and they have to figure out its story. So it's a mystery anime, which is definitely something I appreciate since we don't get to see too many of them nowadays, and it's also one of the more interesting genres in fiction in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately however, Sakurako-san is not what I would call a \"satisfying\" mystery anime. The reasons being a) it's episodic, and b) it's rushed. All of the cases in this anime are resolved in either 1 or 2 episodes, resulting in a myriad of short stories instead of a longer ongoing problem. And quite frankly this is a very bad thing for a series of this genre. Think about it; a complete mystery story needs:\\n\\n\r\n1. A foundation to establish the setting of the case\\n\r\n2. A problem to be solved needs to pop up (like a murder for example)\\n\r\n3. The detective must look around for clues\\n\r\n4. After all the clues have been gathered, the detective must be given time to think about them and try to put the puzzle together (which of course lets the viewers do so as well at the same time)\\n\r\n5. The case must now be solved, the truth brought to light and, if possible, the culprit arrested\\n\r\n6. Finally everything must be wrapped up and the aftermath of the entire incident presented\\n\\n\r\nSo all-in-all, that's quite a lot of ground to cover. In fact, that's way too much ground to cover in just 1-2 anime episodes. There's simply not enough time to go through all the steps properly without either rushing it completely or making the mystery so simplistic that it's not even interesting to begin with. And this is the main problem with Sakurako-san as an anime, namely that it time and time again tries to do too much in too little time.\\n\\n\r\nInstead it almost feels like the anime is trying to cheat the system by skipping a step or two. The whole investigation and pondering phases are almost cut off completely. How? Well simply by making Sakurako be absurdly overpowered as a detective. By that I mean to say that it doesn't matter whether the case in question ends up revolving around human biology, psychology, chemistry or 19th century painting techniques; no matter what it is, Sakurako knows everything. She can figure out any mystery within minutes with almost no clues to work with. In other words:\\n\\n\r\na) Every case ends up feeling very unimportant due to how quickly and easily they are solved\\n\r\nb) It gives the viewer almost no time to think for themselves (which is without a doubt the #1 most important thing in a detective story so this is a huge problem)\\n\r\nc) There is very little semblance of tension since you always know that Sakurako is going to save the day within the next minute no matter what\\n\r\nd) It significantly lowers the story's sense of realism as it doesn't really feel believable a lot of the time\\n\r\ne) As soon as a mystery is resolved, we're back to the status quo again. In other words it kind of feels like the story doesn't even matter in the long run. Although there are brief tie-ins to previous story arcs on rare occasions, it's not anything particularly noteworthy\\n\\n\r\nSo I've talked a lot about Sakurako, but what about Shoutarou, our supposed protagonist? Well... there really isn't a whole lot to say about him. He's just \"there\" as a sidekick, and Sakurako is the one always dragging him along and calling the shots. It's almost like his sole purpose in the show is to be someone for Sakurako to show off to. There are also a bunch of other characters in the show, but they're about as forgettable as it gets. Really the entire anime revolves around Sakurako herself and no one else, which would be common for a detective series, but given that she's hardly what I'd call a well-written detective for a mystery story I still can't consider it a good thing.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end though, despite the fact that there are tons of issues with Sakurako-san as an anime, they all stem from the exact same source. The heart of the problem is quite simply that the total episode count is *way* too small. They should have taken the same amount of content and adapted it in maybe 24 episodes instead of compressing it into merely 12. Everything comes down to that. The rushed pacing means that every mystery story gets way too little exposition and instead they have to fill the holes by using Sakurako as a cheat code, enabling them to skip out on half the steps in every arc. That's like a band aid measure, it doesn't actually resolve the problem itself whatsoever. What makes the mystery genre so fascinating is the process of solving the matter at hand; you investigate for clues, try your best to put them together, and then finally present the solution. Sakurako-san however basically skips out on all that and just blatantly gives you the answer right away. Talk about taking just about all the fun out of it.\\n\\n\r\nWith all that being said, Sakurako-san is still a decent anime which might be worth checking out. It just annoys me because I sincerely believe that it could have been really damn good had it just been paced better (or not been episodic to begin with), but instead we're left with an incredibly flawed final product. Good mystery anime are quite rare to come by, so it saddens me when a series like this pops up with all the potential in the world, only to fall flat for a quite needless reason.",

            "content": "I'm going to start off by saying that I loved! Sakurako-san no Ashimoto ni wa Shitai ga Umatteiru. Personally I thought it had a really great story, character (to a certain extent) and a good sense of enjoyment. Sakurako-san no Ashimoto ni wa Shitai ga Umatteiru is maybe a 7.0 out of 10 on the dark story meter. What I mean by that is the story focuses a lot (judging by if you read the title of the show lol) bones, death dead bodies etc. There is horror in it, however it is natural horror, it's not like an all in your face look atthe bones look at the dead bodes blah blah horror that we usually see in anime's like this one. Another thing I liked about the story was the pacing. Overall the stories pacing of events going on are slow, however the writers do a great job of making this slow pace less annoying by adding additional mystery or mysterious elements. For example they will throw in a detective setting to keep things interesting, like \"what was the motive for this murder?\" etc. The music is \"fitting\" for the show. It is the type of music you what expect to hear in a show that revolves around death and mystery. Lastly, the art. The art style used in the show looks like something from late 2010's so nothing too special to point out other than Sakurako is kind of hot. Overall I think this show would be great for anyone to watch in their spare time however I do not think it's for everyone. Overall I give it 9/10 for that nostalgic sense of mystery and wonder.",

            "content": "I wanted to make this review because of my \u201chatred\u201d for this series. Sakurako-san too long of a name that I can\u2019t remember like, almost, every other light novel name is a pretty bad show, why is it a bad show you may ask? Several reasons.\r\nStory\r\nWhat can I say about the story? There is absolutely no story, it's just a \"bone of the week\" show. This show is more so an episodic mystery than a full on series mystery, because of the \u201cepisodic nature\u201d the mysteries solved in the show are, in the long run, completely pointless and doesn\u2019t mean squat to the overall \"plot\"since they are pretty much forgotten about, oh sure they remember the events but how much did that affect the story and the characters? None.\\n\\n\r\nThough I say this is an \u201cepisodic series\u201d there are three mini-arcs that have the mystery case stretched out to 2 episodes so it doesn\u2019t count as an episodic show, right? Since it has a story? Wrong, it is still episodic even if it has mini-arcs because majority of all episodic shows have stories put right in at the end or as it gradually builds up to it. This show does no such thing, it doesn\u2019t lead to a grand conclusion, it doesn\u2019t build upon one another it\u2019s just forgotten. Oh but they reference the previous cases, so you are wrong! It\u2019s as I said in the above passage, it did not in anyway affect the characters, nor did it the story, they don't learn from it and take anything away from it.\\n\\n\r\nWhere this show fails is the mystery aspect or should I even call it a mystery? This so-called \u201cmystery\u201d is solved only in a matter of one episode, you can even say in a millisecond before the show even begins, so the three mini-arcs are just useless, like I said, why are they useless? I\u2019m glad you (didn\u2019t) ask, they are useless because of how they are handled, typically, in a proper mystery the main character would have to do some, you know, it\u2019s a really fascinating little thing that I like to call, investigating, this \u201cinvestigating\u201d thing is quite something it helps build the mystery and makes us learn about the mystery, the motives, and the overall conclusion to said mystery, what does this show have? A hacks main character that knows everything, there, problem solved! We can go home now!\\n\\n\r\nAlso there is some brief fan-service that is just very questionable, why was it there? What was the purpose? How much were they thinking when they made this? Why didn\u2019t the creator make a proper mystery, since the \u201cfan-service\u201d was more interesting than the rest of this show, sure it\u2019s only in two, or so, episodes but it just out of place and takes away from the show, and is the only interesting thing going on, you have to pander somehow, right?\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound\\n\r\nDA PRETTY COLORS! 1000/10!\\n\r\nDespite being a mystery show the colors were oddly bright, it didn\u2019t fit the presentation and comes off as \u201coff-putting\u201d. The art is still good, despite not matching the overall tone of the show, it is just weird. The colors also take away from the atmosphere of the show, unless you just like the pretty colors then you should have no problem with it, this is suppose to be a mystery so you typically expect darker shades of colors but with this it's too bright.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening song is quite nice, nothing noteworthy, it\u2019s just nice. The ending song is decent. The OST is pretty forgettable since it doesn\u2019t stick out it is just more of a background thing, like it should be, though I feel disappointed on that part. Voice acting? It was alright, voices matched, kind of. Overall I have no real problem with the sound, but wait, the voice actor for Shoutarou didn't match him, it felt too \"deep\", I don't something about it just doesn't sit right.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nWith the cast of characters that we are presented to are pretty poorly written. We have an idiotic policeman that just doesn\u2019t do anything on his own he is just that very annoying character, but he isn\u2019t around long, though his presence currently ruins the mood. We also have a teacher, a teacher, a teacher, it really sounds weird when I think about it, I mean what purpose did he even serve besides being relevant for the last mini-arc in which he isn\u2019t even developed, which is another problem with the characters, they aren\u2019t developed at all! One last character is the schoolgirl, she was a useless \u201clove interest but not really love interest\u201d for the secondary main character, she got her own episode, which was just a GIANT waste of time, that I thought of dropping the show since it was just a waste of time, filler if you will, well anyways she is, I guess, the only developed character? So yay?\\n\\n\r\nOkay now I\u2019m done with the side characters let\u2019s get into the main characters. Let\u2019s start with the secondary main character, Shoutarou Tatewaki or \u201cShounen\u201d (Boy), he is just a very bland character, there is really nothing to him that makes him stand out, he is basically the audience, just there for the \u201cride\u201d. With the last episode how he met Sakurako it was just very cringe worthy, it just didn\u2019t sit right with me. And he also strong? As in physically strong, which kind of came out of nowhere.\\n\\n\r\nSakurako Kujou, I hate her bone fetish, it\u2019s just cringy, why are you so fascinated with bones? That's an easy joke right there. Also, what irritates me about her is that she is just the hacks main character; all she does is ruin the \u201cmystery\u201d aspect the show claims it has, why? The purpose of a mystery is to be, well, mysterious! A mystery is what makes the character guess, investigate and piece together what goes with what, but no, she knows EVERYTHING in the universe, which ruins everything since there is no engagement to the show. Hey why not ask her who really assassinated JFK? The show tries to give a \u201climit\u201d to her hacks power by her saying \u201cOh I don\u2019t know everything\u201d or something like that, so what? The mystery was already broken the moment the show started, more specifically, when she was introduced, so that little limit was pointless, just stop show, please.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion, the characters aren\u2019t written properly, in fact, I dare say they are poorly written. Crazy, right?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nI hate this show, but I enjoy it for how bad the show is, but I had to will my way through this show like a Shounen protagonist that wills their way through the big fight against the big baddie. I also hate it for how much this show tries to be \u201cserious\u201d. This show also got to the point to where it was very very cringy to watch, I just didn\u2019t want to sit in my seat anymore, but I was just forcing myself, the cringe is real with this one. One thing I would like to know is, why did they stop the magical girl transformation thing that happened in the earlier episodes when she said \u201cNow, let\u2019s solve the mystery\u201d it was just brilliantly stupid, oh look they play it at the end of the show, thank you, it still incredibly dumb but amazing! The best thing to take out of this show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nThe mystery is a giant letdown; the engagement is just very low. The characters are poorly written in the way it presents them. Sakurako-san is a pretentious anime that tried to be smarter than it actually is and tried to sound smarter than it actually was, way more than its own good. This show is a try-hard show, it tries way to hard to be serious, more serious than it really should have been. Overall, Sakurako-san is a bad series, just a plain bad series, I would not recommend unless you--you know what there are a lot more better mystery shows out there, I wouldn't tell you to watch this even as a joke since this requires will power to go through, so I recommend to go out and watch an actual good mystery rather than this pseudo intellectual show. This show is just bad and gets a 2.5/10 rating, nothing less nothing more, I don't want to have to do anything with this show for as long as I may live.",

            "content": "Her name isn\u2019t Sherlock Holmes but that doesn\u2019t mean Sakurako can\u2019t solve mysteries. Beautiful Bones: Sakurako\u2019s Investigations, a series based off of the light novel, is a TV anime adaptation that takes place in Asahikawa City. The main female protagonist is a beauty named Sakurako Kujo with an intellect and fascination for bones. She specializes her time in studying bones and examines them like a form of art. Behind those bones usually lies a mystery whether it\u2019d be the remains of an animal or human.\r\nIn essence, the series is a mystery adventure. Almost every episode opens up to a story and reads like a bookwhere we get the introduction of a case, the problem, clues, and resolution. Key players in each mystery case has some direct or indirect connection to the series\u2019 themes. Throughout the show, family has been a key element as we often see how cases relate to deceased relatives and their effects on loved ones. Sakurako often finds herself involved in mystery cases because of a young boy named Shoutarou. Their relationship is rather strange as well as Sakurako refers Shoutarou often as \u201cboy\u201d rather by his given name. There\u2019s also cryptic flashbacks about Sakurako that suggests she has suffered a tragedy that involved the death of a loved one, perhaps bearing resemblance to Shoutarou. But for the majority of the run, the show runs on the structure of an episodic style where mystery sometimes doesn\u2019t see just eye to eye.\\n\\n\r\nWith the amount of mystery, it\u2019s hard to deny that there\u2019s some pacing issues. The first episode only sets up the general concept of the series while the majority of the remaining ones mostly adapts a non-linear story. However, it still offers enough thoughtful mystery-thriller to hook the audience. This is because every mystery involves bones and as each bone is different, there\u2019s a diverse range of ways the series takes interest about itself. Sakurako\u2019s interest about bones is also highlighted easily with her fascination. She\u2019s the type of woman with a level headed coolness and possesses an intimidating intellect. On the other hand, Shoutarou is more of the typical schoolboy who tries to make a difference. The two are hardly alike but does manage their time together to solve cases. Other prominent characters includes Yuriko, a girl who attends the same school as Shoutarou and sometimes also gets involved with mystery cases. Most of the other characters that we see in the show plays a supporting role that includes a teacher, police officer, or even a family dog. A few of them also gets some characterization but mostly related to the cases. Because the show isn\u2019t really all about the \u2018who\u2019 but rather than the \u2018why\u2019, the characterization of the series is generally dense. \\n\\n\r\nMystery shows like this is also crafted by its thrilling atmosphere. There are some episodes that are prime examples of this such as the case of \u201cThe Cursed Man\u201d. Then, there are some rather sincere cases about family like the one about Yuriko\u2019s grandmother. This can be a hit or a miss and sometimes can feel distracting. As I\u2019ve mentioned before, pacing of the show is really a nag. At times, it offers a twisty, stylistic mystery with promise while other times leaves disappointment in the eyes of a boring resolution. It still relies on some old school mystery formula and recycled ideas that isn\u2019t so thrilling. This doesn\u2019t help by Shoutarou\u2019s personality as he is a guy with little characterization but plays as more of a supporting player at each case. Sakurako is also a character that is quite mysterious from the very start. Throughout some episodes, she sometimes gets moments that triggers her past memories. As the show progresses, I think it\u2019s safe to say that sometimes, it\u2019s more about coping with death rather than mysteries themselves. It offers a more realistic side for this show as well as an emotional one based on character stories. It can even feel like the time when you find an old picture album in the attic and appeal with a sense of nostalgia. At other times, the show retorts to its comedic side with some humorous scenarios and dialogues. By general means, the comedy feels pretty natural through conversations. And finally, don\u2019t expect much romance. While the promotional poster seems to look like a teaser, there really isn\u2019t love story angle. \\n\\n\r\nProduced by Troyca, this is their first independent project. Previously, they\u2019ve worked on Aldnoah Zero so do expect some character designs to look familiar such as the case of Shoutaro. But on a visual front, the series is pretty well crafted. Sakurako\u2019s character design is made to look her like a beauty with a haughty personality to reflect her calm nature. The setting also has a serene-like feeling to it with modern decorations and a few noticeable scenes are colored like an art. Prime examples of this includes Sakurao\u2019s declaration when she decides to solve a case. Facial tones are generally standard that expresses their personalities. And finally, we got the bones. While I\u2019m not an expertise at examining bone specimen, I think it\u2019s easy to tell that the show makes them look credible with their structure. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the soundtrack isn\u2019t anything special, it does carry a quiet atmosphere throughout the show. The series may be a mystery but most of the time retains a style that fits with its lighthearted OST. The OP and ED theme songs also gives away some symbolism with hints about Sakurako. I would say that perhaps Sakurako\u2019s voice is the most distinctive in the show. She displays a sharp tongue with an intimidating voice when involved with cases or bones. When she\u2019s not involved, there\u2019s mostly an indifference about her voice tone. Shizuka Ito translates her character well into the show by bringing the personality of a detective to life.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not a spellbound mystery or literature crafted from Sherlock Holmes\u2019 detective stories. This series stands out more as a mystery that deals with the coping of lost life. Bones is the reminiscence deceased, a physical aspect that serves proof of their existence. And when someone discovers that, it can feel a bit nerve wrecking. What this show does makes it look less malevolent but rather thrilling as each bone has a story behind it. Whether you take that mystery as a successful way of storytelling may be a bit of hit or miss. In retrospect though, this show rides on its premise well with a mixed bag for presentation.",

I give most shows decent scores even if it had a lot of problems but Sakurako is something else entirely. I guess i'll explain. \r\nCharacters 2: \r\nThere are only two characters that are important, or maybe it's only one character that is important at all. Anyways, the 'heroine' the show is named after, Sakurako Kujou, is an Osteologist, meaning she studies and collects bones. She is obsessed with finding corpses of animals and humans so that she can add their bones toher collection. She also has a knack for being right about everything with little to no evidence other than. explanations to come.\\n\\n\r\nMale lead who we follow Shoutarou is in every single way an average high school kid who ends up tagging along with Sakurako everywhere she goes. He doesn't do anything helpful, he is typically there just to help Sakurako express what she is thinking in a conversation so that we, the audience, can understand what she is saying. \\n\\n\r\nPlot 3:\\n\\n\r\nThere is no main plot going on in the show early on, it first starts off as the leads finding a corpse on the beach. Sakurako understands everything within 30 seconds of seeing the corpse, the police and everybody around her immediately believe her and take her words as fact. Unfortunately there is no connection between this case and the next, and the next, and the next. They are all random cases that don't connect at all, it's very episodic and Sakurako solves every problem with her expansive knowledge that she apparently inherits from studying bones.\\n\\n\r\nWe see the strings attempting to tie up all the mysteries, that happened before, near the last few episodes. Is somebody behind these murders? If so what is their reasoning for doing this? We will never know, because before the leads find any clues towards finding the antagonist the show ends abruptly without solving anything. Why did I watch this show that is going to leave on such a big cliff hanger, when it isn't a very good show in the first place. It's not like Shokugeki no Souma which was an extremely good show that left on a cliffhanger. This show wasn't all that great from start to finish. \\n\\n\r\nArt 7:\\n\r\nSound 7: \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 3: \\n\\n\r\nI didn't enjoy it, even though I planned on giving it a 6 or 7 if it finished strongly. Unfortunately that did no happen. I was willing to overlook that, while in custody, she was able to make a police officer stop the car and allow her to help with a case about a murder. She could tell you everything about a person's personal life just by looking at their bones. I didn't mind her being absurdly over intelligent for no real reason in attempts to enjoy this show but I didn't. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 3: \\n\\n\r\nIf you can overlook plot holes and mary sue leads, then this is the perfect show for you.",

            "content": "sakurako-san no ashimoto is an average mystery show that many people find it to be boring. it is adapted from an LN of the same name and aired in 2015 fall along with subete ga F ni naru. these two shows of this season somehow didn't pick the interest of many people, and even if they did, they were immediately dropped after the few pilot episodes. as for the reason Sakurako-san no ashimoto wasn't appreciated that much by the viewers, i personally can't answer this question. simply because i fail to find any noticeable flaw that would drive me to drop it.\r\nthe story of SSAhas adapted an episodic pattern, where every episode we get to discover new cases along with their background story and solution. the show should be able to exhibit its nature only in the first pilot episode. every day the main protagonist highschooler join up with sakurako the osteologist after a long day of school. they depart for different places (forest, beach..) and dig up every possible corner in search for rare bones. however for some unknown reason, they always end up finding human corps. that's how the mystery cases set off.\\n\\n\r\nwhile these mysterious aspects may be considered as elementary level compared to other series -the situation is not very complicated if you ask a \"detective Conan\" fan-, the show hands us all the required information to resolve the case right at the beginning. in other words, anyone would be able to find out the truth only by combining the puzzle piece he was given at the start. but yet, i doubt many viewers were able to do so. not until sakurako enters the scene, divulge all the secrets and finally closes the curtains as if nothing had happened. as a result, the whole event starts to look dull and simple.\\n\\n\r\nthe pacing of the series is definetly one of the decisive privileges that makes the one judge if the series is either boring or exciting. the pacing of SSA is very fast. that doesn't mean that it skips some important details.  for a better explanation, let's say every episode is divided into two parts. the first part is where the main cast discovers a body or get dragged into the troublesome situation, it barely lasts for 5 to 8 minutes. and throughout this part, sometimes it is possible to deduct what's going on and find out the truth. then comes the second part that lasts for the rest of the episode and surprisingly feels rushed. the events escalate quickly, the situation becomes more intense until finally everything gets wrapped up as a conclusion. personally, i find this quick pacing to be perfect for a show of this nature. while other people may disagree justifying that it doesn't give a chance to the viewer to keep up with what's going on, i say that slowing down would result in the show being boring instead. the ultimate goal of the series is giving prominence to sakurako's intelligence and driving us to admire her while she resolves different mysteries and makes them look as a piece of cake.\\n\\n\r\ndespite SSA's fast pacing and episodic nature, there are some stories that take up to two episodes. the mystery is far more complicated and most importantly the sphenoider (I'll be talking about him later) is usually the mastermind behind it. the conclusion of this episodes often saves us some exciting cliff-hangers making the viewer anticipate for more.\\n\\n\r\nleaving the mystery aspect aside, this time, let's talk about what does this show's romance holds for us. a 15 years old high schooler possessing a one-sided love for a women in her middle twenties, sakurako. if i had to count every show i know of that covers this kind of relationship it would be only one (garden of words). that's how rare romance featuring two partners of totally different ages is, especially if the guy is the younger. unfortunately, their relationship didn't develop in the least throughout the whole 12 episode, since apparently, SSA doesn't recognize the so-called \"character development\" between main characters. shoutarou who likes sakourako, and sakourako who likes bones, nothing will change that much.\\n\\n\r\nspeaking of bones, sakurako is an osteologist. it is natural for her to be interested in bones. however, her love for them gradually switches from being a peculiar interest to become a frightening, creepy and unstable fetish. despite her taciturn attitude, charming appearance and intelligence, she got quite a childish character, as an example her mood reverses over meaningless things, throwing tantrums whenever she's angry, needless to mention her love for cake and pudding. and then the poor shoutaro, MC and narrator. compared to her he's the complete opposite, totally normal and kinda mature for his age. the poor guy, he hardly deals with his crush's depraved hobby only to get a chance to spend more time in her side. along with his narration and simple character we always get to observe the events through different perspectives. wich again adds up another reason to not get bored.\\n\\n\r\nnow check this: there aren't many side characters in the show. approximately 4 prominent ones. all of them got their own stories, their past was revealed and most essentially we got to see a huge development in some of them. yet no development for the main cast and no considerable development in the plot. what does that mean? the show certainly alluded small details about sakurako's dark secret. in the end of most episodes, after the ending song we could see her talking to herself and blurting some strange lines, or talking to someone in the hospital. honestly, it feels as if she made a contract with a demon, and now she's waiting for her death. but in the end, nothing is revealed. same applies with the sphenoider. he is declared to be a dangerous criminal sakurako is trying to catch, the \"abyss\". but guess what? nothing happened that deserves mentioning either. indeed, the last episode was spent looking back at shoutaro and sakurako's first reunion, however, it is absolutely not the perfect time to promote such a thing. it feels as if all these 11 episodes were for naught, as if we're back to the zero point, and i personally find it to be a bummer, really unfortunate.\\n\\n\r\nthe visuals, in the other hand, are an aspect i can definitely rely on for covering up for the plot's lack of progression. the show's first episode was set in spring, displaying the dazzling scenery of the pink sakura blossoms along with green trees. the exposition of natural scenery in SSA is without a doubt one of its strongest points. especially when the biggest part in the show occurs in such places. surprisingly the bones were also carefully animated. when sakurako starts explaining the victim's characteristic only by examining the remains of the corpse, the bones are not professionally drawn, but at least, it's done with enough details to understand and keep up with what she's saying.\\n\\n\r\nthe opening and ending song are certainly entertaining to listen to, but they carry more than just that. sakurako's obscure past wich was not revealed in the end, are also hinted throughout the visuals display. while the OSTs are nothing noteworthy it still succeeds in fitting with the theme of the events, however not very thrilling as they should feel in some particular situation. shoutarou and sakurako's voice were nicely played. especially shootaround's voice. it was a perfect match for his mature character in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nto conclude it all, let's say that SSA is the slice of life mystery show that lacks romance. getting into it holding these same expectations would make it a very enjoyable watch with no exaggeration, as it did with me. kinda. but if you're looking for something more plot-heavy, a show that knows how to progress a story and how to develop the main characters, then better switch to something else (maybe subete ga f ni naru). you can go ahead and drop it in the first few episode too, while complaining how boring it is. just keep in mind that sakurako-san no ashimoto ni wa shitai ga umatteiru is an anime made for slice of life lovers, as an out-breather from similar melodramatic and school life shows.\\n",

Some people had a problem with the story's pacing but I found this to be a strong positive point of the show. The way that most episodes slowed down and focused on mundane tasks or doing favors for friends such as Kougami grounded the show with a strong sense of realism for me. I don't need grand, over-the-top flashy action scenes or high-octane, intense thrills. This show understands that death doesn't need to be flashy, it can have a soothing aura to it as well. This show heavily focuses onthe theme of death, and it presents it as something that doesn't need to be feared, sometimes it brings people closer together. This show is full of real human beings and their unique stories and I loved it so much. But for all of you who wanted a ridiculous killing spree of a series maybe you'll get that in the second season.",

            "content": "It's hard to put my finger on exactly what it is with Sakurako that clicks. As this is the second mystery anime of the season that I've seen; it's hard to not compare Sakurako and Perfect Insider- as disparately as the way they tell their stories and treat their characters are. A quick way to put it would be that the show watches a lot like \"Bones\" mixed with \"Castle\" and some \"Law and Order SVU\". Mostly the first two. \r\nSakurako focuses on two characters- a high school kid named Shoutarou, and the bourgeoisie, genius young lady that he hangs out with- the eponymous Sakurako.A few major supporting characters also float in and out- Utsumi the cop, Yuri, a schoolmate of Shoutarou's, Isozaki, a teacher at their school, and Sakurako's grandma- the chillest, sassiest, every-one's-grandma ever. Their stories are mostly arc based, or they simply appear as contacts or random happenings as the story progresses. \\n\\n\r\nWhat's interesting about Sakurako and Shoutarou's relationship is how inverse it really seems, especially to outsiders. Sakurako, despite her nearly royal upbringing, is probably 23 going on 3 years old. She has terrible social cues, a temper,  is openly rude to nearly everyone, and has a penchant for speaking her mind, no matter to whom, or what about- much to the chagrin of Shoutarou. \\n\r\nShoutarou on the other hand is more of a father figure in the relationship with Sakurako, despite being her junior by as many as 10 years. He acts practically as her handler and mouthpiece, particularly when dealing with the police- a group whose attention she often attracts with her obsession with acquiring bones, even if it meant stealing state evidence in a homicide investigation. It's obvious that Shoutarou has the hots for Miss Bones, even if  she doesn't seem to reciprocate those romantic feels. Shoutarou is a bit bland for a protagonist, but his even and mellow personality reflect the petulant little tyrant that Sakurako wants to be- often with humorous results. They balance each other out pretty well.\\n\\n\r\nOne point that I found interesting is that though Sakurako involves high school age kids, they're not the real focal point of the show, and neither does the show include a bunch of mundane and pointless scenes taking place in the local high school. I appreciate that, a lot. In fact, the setting for Sakurako is as off beat as its eponymous character, being that the series takes place in Hokkaido, the northernmost part of Japan, bordering Russia. As such, it involves a lot of coastal, mountainous, and forested areas, vs the typical urban environment of school-set anime. This lends itself to some beautiful natural vistas, homes, and generally a more rustic feel.\\n\r\nThis is the first solo production the new studio TROYCA has undertaken, and I felt they did a great job with production values for what's an average of average budgeted anime. \\n\\n\r\nSakurako being a mystery anime, it would be against my nature to spoil the plot for anyone, so I have to say that anyone reading who's not seen the show should see it for themselves (see this as my recommendation), but I have to comment on the way the story presents itself. What's seemingly an episodic sort of slice of life about Shoutarou tagging along with Sakurako places and them happening to come upon bones (sometimes human) in their travels- along with Sakurako helping Shoutarou solve people's mysterious happenings/deaths/etc. By the end of the show, what seemed like loose ends and random dead end plot points manage to connect with some red threads with a pretty thrilling conclusion, if a bit expected. If I were to say one thing about Sakurako- it's a bit more clever than it looks plotwise, for a show about a woman whose near boundless intellect enables her to solve the murder or medical malady of nearly anyone. \\n\\n\r\nSome would say that Sakurako herself is a huge deus ex machina with her sometimes implausible amount of intellect and knowledge that enable her to solve crimes with very few clues, but as a viewer, I was also coming to some of the same conclusions she was, given the same amount of time. This isn't an excuse for breaking \"show, not tell\", but it wasn't a Light Yagami VS L level of jumping to seemingly illogical conclusions only to be right. Sakurako stays grounded, even though the titular character sometimes feels like she has a supernatural mind. \\n\\n\r\nThe biggest issue with Sakurako's story is certainly the length. If Sakurako were a two cour series, it would be able to make a lot better use of time, because the pacing is, at times, so fast that it almost feels like an abbreviated form of a mystery. In one episode you'll have a setup and introduction, exposition, and then have the mystery solved. That's a lot of progression for 24 minutes, and as such it feels rushed. The arcs that take up two episodes feel a lot more natural and the extended length of time gievs the audience more time to hypothesize and try to figure the mystery out for themselves vs just being directly told by Sakurako.\\n\\n\r\nIf the show had more room to stretch its legs, I imagine that it would be a heck of a lot better, as it ended leaving me wanting more. It's likely that as recent as Sakurako is, they simply did not have enough material to animate into a second cour- but with that, I have to say that I will look forward to whatever comes in the future.\\n",

            "content": "(This is a spoiler-free review adapted for this site)\r\n[Synopsis]: High School student Tatewaki Shoutarou (Enoki, Junya) led a normal enough life until he met Kujou Sakurako (Itou, Shizuka), a beautiful, young woman and genius Osteologist who is endlessly fascinated with bones. Together on their outings they always seem to chance upon human remains after which it falls to the unlikely duo to discern the story of the bones and solve the mysteries they present.\r\n[Characters]:\r\nSakurako-san focuses almost entirely on the explorations and interactions of its two protagonists while intermittently featuring recurring supporting characters alongside a primarily episodic cast. The show\u2019s attention to its main characters iswell founded as none of the supporting cast receives much in the way of characterization beyond their own independent installments.\\n\\n\r\nThe first episode of the show does a great job of introducing both Shoutarou and Sakurako \u2013 you get a strong sense of each of their personalities and dynamic of their relationship. Shoutarou is typical enough as far as high school students are concerned and his ordinary outlook and design serves as a point of contrast to Sakurako\u2019s stranger perspective on the developments of the show. As a layman he serves as our investigative eyes into Sakurako\u2019s world of bones and murder mysteries. He avoids feeling cliche in a number of ways however perhaps the most interesting is the straightforward nature of his attraction to Sakurako \u2013 the two make great friends outside of the realm of romance and seeing such skin-deep and hormonal elements at play in their relationship was refreshing and unique. While Shoutarou certainly had a place in the show initially it felt like he was quickly dispensed into becoming a sort of straight man in opposition to Sakurako\u2019s outlandish assertions and blunt nature. Its one thing to have him keep her in check and keep the story grounded however something else entirely to simply point out the eccentricities of her behavior as if to remind the audience that her actions are something other than typical.\\n\\n\r\nSakurako on the other hand I felt quite compelling all throughout for a myriad of reasons. For one thing I thought that having a slightly older heroine was refreshing but moreover her personality, a marriage of the smug intellectual with near-childish enthusiasm, was a great deal of fun given her age and vocation. Its always a pleasure to see an emotive, adult character and Sakurako exhibits great reasons for why she acts the way that she does. She is distant emotionally and generally isn\u2019t phased by sentimental attachments which go well with her logical persona. Her brand of morality is slightly warped by her logic and practical mindset but something more human and emotional seems to be stirring under the surface which gives her a wonderfully complex and genuine feeling. To speak to her one fault within the show, it rests outside of her actual characterization and instead with the way in which she interacts with the plot of the show. The first episode does well in establishing her area of expertise \u2013 making her out to be not only fanatical about bones but incredibly knowledgeable about them as well. The problem that arises is that it often feels as if Sakurako is perhaps \u2018too knowing\u2019 at times.\\n\\n\r\nIt is quite well figured that she knows what she does about bodies and murder scenes given her interest in bones and her familial relation to a forensics investigator however when the terrain shifts towards that of the artistic and even the religious she seems to sport the same wicked intellect without skipping a beat. The show occasionally treated her more like a resource of absolute information in order to tell the story instead of an individual with concrete knowledge and expertise. She often became a font of uncommon knowledge rather than a character with intellectual limitations. Little is done to lampshade this character trait and so its awkward presence goes more or less unanswered within her overall characterization.\\n\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]:\\n\\n\r\nI quite enjoyed the visuals of Sakurako-san and the first episode opens with an exciting sequence of animation and colors. The character designs and some of the environments are highly reminiscent of TROYCA\u2019s other work Aldnoah.Zero however I felt that Sakurako-san gave a familiar aesthetic new life. Its definitely safe to say that the show is very pretty \u2013 it has a great variety of colors and plenty of wonderful scenery ranging from incredibly detailed houses to vibrant forests.\\n\\n\r\nSomething I felt Sakurako-san did especially well was animating facial expressions and character movement which were used effectively to convey emotions and add some much appreciated legitimacy to the actions and behaviors of otherwise plain, supportive characters as well as the main cast. Another minor thing to note relates back to Shoutarou\u2019s seemingly adolescent attraction to Sakurako as discussed above. The show hardly busies itself with fan-service however the camera work surrounding Shoutarou\u2019s perception of her I thought was an intelligent addition to the show and their chemistry. The camera shots of Sakurako\u2019s cleavage and exposed stomach in different episodes do a great job of emphasizing his surface-level, sexual attraction to her. These scenes avoid feeling like true fan service due to their highly intermittent presence and inconsequential nature but present what I thought was a refreshingly straightforward take on a characters attraction to someone else.\\n\\n\r\n[Story]:\\n\\n\r\nLike many mystery shows before it, Sakurako-san unfolds in a fairly episodic manner with the majority of the episodes being standalone stories of Shoutarou and Sakurako\u2019s adventures. The two certainly share something resembling a Sherlockian dynamic though Shoutarou may leave a bit to be desired in this comparison while Sakurako measures up quite well given her ability to pick out minute details concerning the bones they discover. The show at first seemed interested in developing certain themes such as stagnation and the passage of time however I felt these things were quickly forgotten after the first episode and though the final episode attempts to resurrect these ideas they appear highly non-relevant and jumbled.\\n\\n\r\nThe early episodes I felt were enjoyable and the manner in which Sakurako went about solving the mysteries felt unique and interesting because of how she derived most of the information from the bones she found. I remember episode 4 particularly well as it was quite slow paced and very methodical in its detailing and conversation which made the character interactions and behaviors feel especially realistic. My main gripe with the plot of the show is in how, even early on, it begins to establish something more overarching and significant than the individual mysteries but never finds the time to actually capitalize on that area of the story. There appears to be something linking together many of the victims and situations that Sakurako and Shoutarou encounter but rather than building up the eventual conflict with minor details scattered throughout and delivering a final, more imperative story in respect to the show\u2019s main characters, it simply peters out without addressing anything.\\n\\n\r\nNormally I would at least somewhat forgive a show in Sakurako-san\u2019s position if it were simply a case of the show not having enough time to tell the story that it wanted to however given a handful of episodes that I didn\u2019t feel were all that interesting or even relevant in the midsection of the show I can\u2019t help but feel it squandered what time it had. Some episodes for instance were of no import to the characterization of the protagonists or the overarching mystery behind many of their adventures. These would feel far more at home in the show had it not split its ambition in this way and proceeded either concisely with a significant end in mind or purely on a standalone basis without attempting to develop something greater than itself. This isn\u2019t to condemn the show\u2019s episodic nature due to its inability to deliver something of greater import before the end because I think a majority of the episodes were entertaining in and of themselves.\\n\\n\r\nTo make matters somewhat worse, the show ends on a somewhat odd note \u2013 not in the cliffhanger sense but rather it left me feeling as if the episode could have been utilized better. It focused primarily on Shoutarou and a dilema of his that didn\u2019t have much prefacing within the show or even much reason to give it consequence. The show arrives at a somewhat disappointing conclusion after eluding to a figure behind the otherwise independent events of the show and just before pulling back the curtain greets the viewer with a contextual flashback episode that attempts to answer questions that were never asked in the first place. The episode itself is alright in respect to the characters however it felt as if it could have taken place at any time during the show.\\n\\n\r\n[Music]:\\n\\n\r\nThe show\u2019s soundtrack was pretty enjoyable all throughout and matched the show\u2019s atmosphere and subject matter well though, outside of its main theme which seemed to reappear at some point every episode, I didn\u2019t feel any of the music was too memorable.\\n\\n\r\n[Final Thoughts and Rating]: \\n\\n\r\nSakurako-san was a show that initially had me quite excited because of its early episodes, Sakurako\u2019s characterization, and her chemistry with Shoutarou. While the mysteries were fairly interesting there was an unpleasant tendency exhibited by the plot where it would wrap back around to supporting characters it had already introduced in highly improbable ways resulting in a myriad of more or less standalone stories feeling far more self-contained than they had any right to be. It felt unbelievable, especially for a mystery show.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 6\\n\\n\r\nI gave Sakurako-san a 6 because it had wonderfully unique main characters, a flashy, vibrant aesthetic, and a handful of interesting-enough short mystery stories that kept my attention. It fell short of higher scores because of its failed attempt to create something more substantial and its lackluster supporting cast along with its needlessly self-contained narrative progression. Ultimately it was more fun watching Sakurao with her brash interactions and childish enthusiasm than anything else.\\n\\n\r\n[Recommendations]:\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend Sakurako-san to anyone interested in a decent mystery show with a fun heroine character though I would warn that it is the kind that reveals the details of its mysteries by means of its characters rather than allowing them to be picked up on by its viewers and pieced together beforehand, foreshadowing aside.",

            "content": "I don't know about you, but the whole \"mundane, reactionary dude and a sociopathic genius with a knack for solving mysteries \" set up has been rubbing me off as of late. I already had the atrocious \"Ranpo Kitan\" sear itself into my memory just weeks before Beautiful Bones: Sakurako's Investigation began, so realistically speaking (even with the cliche premise I described) the show could not be any worse. I sure as hell was right, but not by anywhere near as far a margin I would have liked. \r\nThe mood Beautiful Bones goes for is a pretty strange blend between the macabre and the mundanevarying one weekly episodic endeavour to another. To give you an idea, the script goes from murder mysteries to something as innocuous as finding out the final wishes of a dead grandmother. This is not really a problem to me in theory since it isn't uncommon for episodic titles to jump back, forth and sideways between tones, nor should it be discouraged. Bluntly put, it's just that the mysteries are either boring, badly written or both. Right off the bat the series asks for a high degree of suspension of disbelief when Sakurako arrives at a crime scene with human remains and is allowed to push around and belittle the police their despite the fact she lacks the credentials to even be at a crime scene to begin with, and it only gets worse from there. To further illustrate my problems with how mysteries are dealt with in Beautiful Bones, allow me to draw your attention to another episodic title starring a genius investigator, Master Keaton. It's a series where you could reasonably make a case for the main character being a \"Mary Sue\" in how his deductions are never wrong and the way in which he can competently handle all kinds of dangerous situations, but the reason why Master Keaton can get away with it is because the writers restrict Keaton's intellect to his broad areas of expertise as a human civilizations buff and a former British SAS soldier. That way you can, at least, buy that he would know how to do everything from identifying obscure pieces of jewelry to disarming criminals at close quarters. Sakurako, on the other hand, spends her entire life studying bones as an osteologist yet is sometimes able to draw random factoids convenient to the situation at hand. One moment she can be an expert on knot-tying, the next, a 19th-century paint aficionado. The emotional impact the show tries to go for with some of these stories is always hampered for one reason or another, whether it be the realization of how the characters bring misfortune due to their own stupidity, the pacing being rushed, or the mysteries themselves being just too low in stakes to care about (without good characters driving them) the show always found a way to leave me cold.\\n\\n\r\nIf you watch Beautiful Bones for the character interactions, you may find yourself as disappointed as one looking for well-written mysteries. The only characters in the show worth wasting digital ink on are Sakurako and her sidekick Shoutarou. I already went into how Sakurako's Sakurako-isms are bad for the mysteries, but the character herself went someone I originally found to be mildly amusing to watch at 1st to one I found rather unlikeable by the end. There's a difference between being unsentimental and being outright cruel to people, and I was hoping that through her adventures with her social norm abiding sidekick she would come to find that line. Instead by the penultimate episode, Sakurako is still the type of person who would wave around bits of newly discovered human remains around the people that cared about the deceased. There's also some subplot regarding Sakurako's history with a dead younger brother which is continually hinted at, yet never gets any closure by the end, so much for that I guess. No better a character is her boring accessory Shoutarou, whose main role in the story is to be the voice of proper social etiquette to counterbalance Sakurako's wackiness (sort of like a straight man of a comedic duo but applied  to a mystery anime). It wasn't enough for him to be a boring archetype, however, he also gets to be a part of annoying and cliche drama. Such as the time where he cries over how Sakurako doesn't show the same level of sentimental attachment to the bones of long dead cats (which shouldn't be a surprise considering not even seeing dead bodies phases her at all). The drama usually ends with Sakurako turning out to be a bit more kind-hearted than normal before ending the episode on a happy note before starting it all over again later. The formulaic drama didn't make me like either of them more as characters so much as it accentuated just how little the two seem to learn from each other. The final episodes put up one last-ditch effort to convince me of their friendship, yet failed since the two of them as individuals aren't particularly likeable, and the fact that it became clear that the main hanging plot thread (Sakurako's quest to stop a pretentious serial killer who collects sphenoids for some reason, aptly named \"the Sphenoider\") was left as bait for a 2nd season I don't care to ever see come into existence.\\n\\n\r\nThe worst thing I really have to say about Beautiful Bones, however, is that there is no reason to remember it now that it's done airing (asides from the fantastic background art). It's not utterly terrible like Ranpo Kitan, but it never showed enough promise to even be a memorable disappointment",

Ep 4 and 5. about the attempted suicide of Takeshi Fujioka...why would would he fake an attack and making it look like a suicide by cutting himself in his leg , was just too lame even by \"B\" movie standards, also gradma who fell from her dead in ep 3, they could have chosen a good timing to found the bones, now logically speaking if someone is missing wouldn't granddaughter Yuriko Kougami be reporting as a missing person, wouldn't the cop be on location of the dead granny in the soonest possible time? So it was safe to say that the scenarios and the plot wasn't about the mystery rather it was a dark adventure and indirect romance of Sakurako the cougar and Shoutaru the tadpole. Cu'z IMO this is what original creator Ota, Shiori was focusing, which IMO is \"fair\"enough.   \\n\\n\r\nArt (up)\\n\\n\r\nThere isn't any moe in it in fact Sakurako attire were either tomboyish with her white shirt and black slacks attire or classy in her feminine attire, which is IMO deserves a \"Very Good\" for art director Itou Akira, since there isn't any fanservice or any bikini scene here, and it's a \"Very Good\" thing that this anime didn't rely on the those things to sell, just her back scene from the ending theme, it's a big sorry for them perves cu'z they won't be able to make love with Sakurako in their dreams.\\n\\n\r\nSound (up)\\n\\n\r\nWell it's good that the seiyuu who did Sakurako's voice matched the character and the opening theme match the anime as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (up)\\n\\n\r\nOk, so Sakurako was great and she one lady who has both brains and guts, but that's just the thing.....she was overmade, how can a  Osteologist be a forensic psychologist, chemist, archaeologist and all that CSI she bang, be that good when she's only in her twenties.  Shoutarou was also being overmade as well like how can a shorty like him take down a junkie from ep.2 where, even with the knowledge of jujitsu in his bodyframe he would have a very hard time to take-on a junkie who is chemically imbalance where in reality would take at least 2 guys to subdue such guy. IMO, original creator Ota, Shiori didn't properly utilize the proper casting and the right action for the job, in ep.2 it should have been Utsumi who should be taking down the junkie not Shoutarou, if it were me, I would have had Utsumi to try to subdue a junkie despite of getting  stabbed and Shoutarou should have help him by knocking the Junkie's leg with a 2x4 wood. In ep 4 and 5, it should not be Utsumi who should be casted with with the two , rather it should have been Itsuki who should have be there as the cast, in ep 10 and 11 , it should have been Utsumi who should be casted there with the two and not Itsuki, so basically the choice of cast with the two ( Sakurako and Shonen) for each episode was just \"Poor\" that in every episode plot make the support characters ill-fit for it. And let's not for the Sakurako's fiance...where is he, his absence alone really makes this anime focus on a cougar and tadpole relationship. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (up)\\n\\n\r\nBasically my enjoyment was simply with the cougar and tadpole, and that's as far as I go, in fact I'm very much disgusted with this anime's supposed crime drama .\\n\\n\r\nOverall (up) \\n\\n\r\nMy advice, don't focus on the mismatch crime solving and just focus on  the cougar and tadpole mystery romance, so overall it's a decent anime.\\n\\n\r\nPeace and Happy upcoming 2016.",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nThe closest I have ever been to death is a moment that I don\u2019t even remember.\r\nComplications during childbirth are common. For me, at the (very) tender age of ten seconds old, there were two such complications: the umbilical cord and my size. The cord just so happened to wrap itself around my throat, cutting off oxygen to my body. As for my size, I was so huge (ten pounds, eight ounces) that I got stuck in the birthing canal.\r\nThe doctors, desperate to save both my mom and me, made the decision to add a thirdcomplication: bone breakage. To get me out in the world, they snapped my collar bone, stopping death and granting life. They got the umbilical cord situation sorted out, too, but, by that point, I looked like a massive, blue mess.\\n\\n\r\nFor me, bones technically mean everything. For Sakurako of Sakurako-san no Ashimoto ni wa Shitai ga Umatteiru, bones literally mean everything. As for the anime itself, well, it has a few broken bones of its own.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nSakurako-san slates itself as a mystery anime. To this end, it decides on the episodic approach. The season consists of multiple mini-arcs with no arc lasting longer than two episodes. One arc involves a lost child. Another focuses on a lover\u2019s decision. Another still deals with three previous best friends.\\n\\n\r\nAlmost every episode has one trait in common: bones. Be it a skull found at the beach or some skeletal remains found at the foot of a hill, bones are often within reach. They make up the mystery part of the anime; they cause the audience to question how those bones came to be.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cQuestion\u201d is a bit lenient, however, because the audience never really gets to surmise or figure out the circumstances behind the bones. I.e., Sakurako does most of the work. This in turn makes the mystery part of the anime a moot point. Which is weird. If the mystery does not matter, then what is the point of the anime?\\n\\n\r\nThe answer derives from both the episodic format and the bones: life and death. Sakurako alludes to this idea in the last episode when she talks about cherry-blossom trees (and, indirectly, the title of the anime.)\\n\\n\r\nThe bones that Sakurako and Shoutarou find each tell a story. A story that, despite the bones being bleached with age or preserved in a box, still exists. Stories that are touching, emotional. They demonstrate what makes people human. Stories about a mother that loves her daughter and baby, the difficulty of moving on with one\u2019s life, and relationships borne of mutual troubles.\\n\\n\r\nAnd as Sakurako further talks about, time does not stop. While the bones are fragments of the past, the present still has the people connected to those bones. Those people have memories. They have feelings. They have a connection that neither bones nor time can stifle come the future. So, in Sakurako-san\u2019s vision, it\u2019s best to live. To create those memories and share those feelings. In other words, death comes, but life comes first.\\n\\n\r\nThematically, the anime does well. On a writing level, however, it gets shaky. The episodic format does not entice the anime to have a prevalent, overarching narrative. An underlying thread exists in the form of Hanabusa, the mastermind behind many of the killings, but his name and his importance are very rarely referenced. Arguably, though, since he remains unimportant to the majority of the anime, his lack of presence is likewise unimportant.\\n\\n\r\nThe episodic format also prevents the audience from properly resonating with the stories told. Quickly going from one person\u2019s dilemma and tale to the next without letting the message sink in hampers the impact. Worse still, many of the messages are spilled out amidst the explanation of the mystery and, consequently, as large expository asides that are difficult to digest.\\n\\n\r\nGoing back to the mysteries themselves, the presentation of each one also treads into repetitive territory. The boy and woman show up, find some bones, and, after finding a few clues, Sakurako solves the case. The argument that the repetition correlates to the repetitive nature of life and death comes off as more of an excuse rather than a purposeful decision.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the narrative contains stories that, while not individually sound, collectively advocate the importance of life, the importance of death, and the messages that can be gleaned between them.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nOne of Sakurako-san\u2019s strongest facets is its art.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the cinematography is nothing special, consisting of standard shots, the backgrounds more than make up for any stagnancy in perspective. Various locations from dense forests to bustling festivals are visited. Sakurako\u2019s study, the living room of the man with the weak heart, and Yumiko\u2019s side room demonstrate the large amount of detail that goes into each location. And the lighting goes into overdrive, basking the different areas in sunlight, moonlight, and streetlamps.\\n\\n\r\nSakurako\u2019s specialized sequence, where a bountiful bunch of bones begin to walk about her as though they were alive, was a neat effect. Unfortunately, the anime rarely uses the sequence beyond the first quarter of the anime, making one wonder where it went and wanting to see more of it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter designs are a small step down from the art. In general, they are quite plain, the characters lacking specific qualities that make their looks interesting. Shoutarou\u2019s beige hair, the teacher\u2019s suit, and the police officer\u2019s work uniform are fitting but not exactly stunning. In fairness, the anime depicts realistic situations and people, so having realistic-looking characters makes sense.\\n\\n\r\nSakurako\u2019s design, however, deserves more attention. Her look is that of a classic beauty \u2013 long, dark hair, an ample figure, and an attractive face with striking eyes and a beauty spot for extra allure. Designing her as beautiful rather than ugly when Sakurako\u2019s character revolves around death speaks volumes on how the anime views death. Her regular outfit also needs to be mentioned. She wears a white top with black pants, a famous dichotomy on the color spectrum. Here, it symbolizes the main theme of the anime: life and death.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the actual animation, it remains relatively high. The laidback nature of the anime \u2013 no action-heavy scenes or the like \u2013 allows the cast to move with clarity. Hair and limb movements, as well as facial expressions and eye shifts, persist throughout the show, breathing life into an otherwise lifeless anime.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nTechnically speaking, Sakurako-san has a lot of characters. But, technically speaking, the vast majority of them are largely unimportant.\\n\\n\r\nTheir importance goes down due to the episodic format. Much of the cast has no presence between the different arcs \u2013 mostly because the people related to the bones are not the main or supporting characters.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, this statement is not true for every character. The cop takes part in some episodes. So does the teacher. And Yumiko, Shoutarou\u2019s classmate, is literally a relative of the deceased in her story. But even these characters are not all that important. They exist as vehicles for the messages being told in their respective stories. To put it differently, they do not develop as characters per se, but they do allow the audience to understand the importance of the story being told.\\n\\n\r\nSimilar to the narrative, then, who are the important characters of Sakurako-san? This question is a lot easier to answer compared to before: Shoutarou and Sakurako.\\n\\n\r\nStarting with Shoutarou, he is a high-school student who has recently taken some interest in bones. Said interest comes from his interest in Sakurako. While it is implied that he has feelings or, at the minimum, a crush on the beautiful lady, he began to hang out with her as a means to escape a life that he found boring.\\n\\n\r\nOver the course of the season, the audience comes to learn more about Shoutarou. He has training in martial arts. He seems to only think about food. He had a grandmother that cared deeply for him \u2013 more so than he ever knew.\\n\\n\r\nShelving Shoutarou for the moment, Sakurako could not be more different than him. As an osteologist, her life\u2019s work demands the study of bones. But it is more than just studying them: Sakurako loves bones more than she loves life itself. Thanks to her skeletal-spying, teeth-inspecting, and knowledge-having ways, she leads the charge in every mystery, revealing the truth of the bones before her.\\n\\n\r\nLike Shoutarou, more about her person is made known over the course of the season. She has a mean sweet tooth, especially when it comes to cakes and puddings. She has a fianc\u00e9 whose sole purpose (since he is never actually shown) is to deter Shoutarou from pursuing his feelings (and angering the audience, too). Most important of all is her hatred of death, a byproduct of a traumatizing event from her past.\\n\\n\r\nGetting back to the technical speaking, Shoutarou and Sakurako do not develop as characters. At least, not to a substantial extent. Sakurako overcomes her fear of death by accepting Shoutarou, and Shoutarou overcomes the stagnant river of life by chasing after Sakurako. But these developments of theirs occur in the final episode. They are a culmination of the events, but a singular moment is not a large amount of change for the two.\\n\\n\r\nOn an individual basis, their characters continue to prove how mishandled they are. For Shoutarou, the anime rarely shows how he came to find life so boring, what made him believe that his current course could be different. For Sakurako, that traumatizing event about her younger brother Soutarou never has a solid foundation. The event is barely referenced on occasion, but the actual moment is not shown. For an anime that emphasizes the past so much, it is surprising how little it cares about the pasts of its two main characters.\\n\\n\r\nWhere Shoutarou and Sakurako shine best is on a group basis.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the discussions on their characters above, a certain pattern arises. Shoutarou is about life. He questions the life he leads. He regularly thinks positively about life. He loves life\u2019s people, emotions, and opportunities. In contrast, Sakurako is about death. She fixates on death\u2019s aftermath. She hates death itself. She defines herself as one truly traumatized by death.\\n\\n\r\nShoutarou represents life. Sakurako represents death. Combined, they represent a beautiful and philosophical sentiment: life and death are inseparable. Just as Shoutarou chases after Sakurako, life (inevitably) chases after death. And just as Sakurako embraces Shoutarou, death (inevitably) embraces life. Shoutarou and Sakurako are a team in the same way that life and death (or death and life, depending on one\u2019s outlook) happen to be.\\n\\n\r\nOne could even argue how the faux romantic separation between Shoutarou and Sakurako symbolizes the separation between life and death \u2013 they are a coupling but two entities that can never realistically be together. A slight stretch, but it\u2019s fun to think about.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless, Shoutarou and Sakurako mean a lot to each other even if they do not mean much on their own. And given that their shared theme of life and death is similarly shared with the narrative\u2019s theme, they have more strength as characters than originally perceived.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nEasily the strongest part of the music is the ending track. Taking on more of a chilling tone, the vocalist accompanies a small number of instruments, letting her do most of the work. During the first half, the OP is nuanced and atmospheric. It\u2019s not until the second half that the piece picks up, a more pronounced beat and lengthier lyrical sections taking shape.\\n\\n\r\nIn a way, the ED mirrors the mystery cases Sakurako solves: They start off weird and unknown, and they end with a defined conclusion. The whole track is ghostly, strange, and melancholic, standing as a wonderful addition to Sakurako-san.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening track goes down a different route. Piano dominates much of the piece with a drum beat and some nice vocal work from the singer. Compared to the ED, the OP is happier, optimistic in tone. And this direction makes sense \u2013 having a happy OP and a sad ED matches the life and death motif that permeates the rest of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem with the OP, however, is the presentation. Where the ED sounds nuanced and foreboding, the OP sounds as though a lot of noises were mashed together. So while the piece has power in the context of the show, the piece lacks appeal outside of it.\\n\\n\r\nThen there is the rest of the original soundtrack. Sakurako\u2019s investigative tracks, called (coincidentally enough) \u201cSakurako\u2019s Investigation\u201d and \u201cAn Answer to the Puzzle,\u201d are the highlights. Their back-and-forth tune and triumphant composition work in tandem to form a track that follows the mystery-to-solved progress of the cases, much like the ED does.\\n\\n\r\nThe large number of the tracks, however, are more atmospheric in nature. These tracks are usually one of two tones: slice-of-life like \u201cInnocent Honesty\u201d or sad like \u201cSuper Regret.\u201d Sticking mostly to these two tones follows along with the consistent life-and-death motif that Sakrurako-san has been shown to use. These tracks are not particularly impressive, but they are fitting for the anime nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nVoice-acting performances are neither amazing nor awful; they are okay for what had been provided. Shizuka Itou as Sakurako uses a mature and slightly arrogant voice that fits the beautiful woman. Junya Enoki, in one of his first major roles, as Shoutarou uses a younger voice for the so-called boy. And while Sakurako has moments of emotion \u2013 most often when she remembers Soutarou through Shoutarou \u2013 and Shoutarou can get stern with Sakurako, the scenes do not demand much out of the characters, so they never have the chance to shine.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nAs a romance buff, it was certainly disappointing to see the anime refuse to pursue the romantic pairing between Shoutarou and Sakurako. That kind of relationship \u2013 an older woman being with a younger man \u2013 is rarely seen in anime, so when it seems like it should obviously exist and it doesn\u2019t, the whole situation becomes infuriating.\\n\\n\r\nIt also does not help that Sakurako seems to show zero romantic interest in Shoutarou, quelling those thoughts anyway. And combined with the anime not pursuing the other romantic pairing of Shoutarou and Yumiko, the lack of romance made me mad to see.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Sakurako, I cannot say that I liked her all that much. She\u2019s certainly attractive in looks and she can be cute when she wants to, but, in personality, she was a turn-off. Very rude, very insensitive.\\n\\n\r\nDespite my anger at the lack of romance and my dislike of Sakurako\u2019s personality, I liked the banter between her and Shoutarou. Shoutarou acting like a parent and Sakurako acting like a child made for some funny scenes, like when Sakurako tried to steal that skull or when Shoutarou used the information center to locate his \u201clost child.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters are ones I did not care for much. Shoutarou is overly plain. The buddy cop seems like a nice dude, but, following the halfway mark of the season, he never shows up again. The teacher is similar. Yumiko, despite acting as the rebound romantic interest, is actually annoying. She is a fun character to have on screen \u2013 cute, confident, and caring \u2013 but she is a bit too much of a goody-two-shoes.\\n\\n\r\nMy favorite tales from the season were Yumiko\u2019s grandmother\u2019s painting, Shoutarou\u2019s grandmother\u2019s pudding, and the mother protecting her children. I love my family to bits, so hearing about how much thought the grandmothers put into their respective actions for their grandchildren was something I understood from my own grandmother. As for that third tale, Ii-chan was a cute kid that made the gloomy anime slightly brighter.\\n\\n\r\nThe other tales were fine but not really to my liking. It was a combination of the characters involved and the tales being told. The \u201ccursed\u201d man, the three best friends, and the cat and caretaker just didn\u2019t have the same oomph as everything else.\\n\\n\r\nSakurako-san no Ashimoto ni wa Shitai ga Umatteiru encounters both life and death. Some strong themes laced with mediocre writing. Some nice art and music filled with weaknesses. And some interesting tales while others not-so-much. The anime\u2019s like a broken collar bone: technically worthwhile in some ways but literally problematic in others.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, a nice theme on life and death, supported by shoddy, singular tales\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Good, nice art, okay character designs, and above-average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, Shoutarou and Sakurako\u2019s duality of life and death holds strength even if their individual characters do not\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, okay OP, good ED, okay OST, okay VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Bad, tiptoeing around the romance, an unlikable cast, and only a handful of the tales were interesting\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 5/10",

            "content": "You know what my big problem with light novel adaptations are? They never have a good story. Okay there's one or two exceptions, but for the most part, when their plots aren't being dumb, they're just non-existent in general. It's always world-building or character-building for its own sake, which is basically showcasing the finest bullets in the world without a gun to actually fire them with. Impressive-looking bullets my friend, but unless you're planning to make the bad guys swallow the damn things, I don't see how they're going to help us here.\r\nWell, impressive may be giving most light novel adaptations too much credit becausethey generally look like ass on top of their other problems. But to be fair to Beautiful Bones, it does look nice for the most part - even if said niceness is often undercut with choppy direction and awful usage of filters. If this is going to be the norm for all of Studio Troyca's output, then you can add them to the list of fledgling studios that failed to make it big, because it's not a good look. I guess we'll see what happens in their future stuff, but for now, let's focus on Beautiful Bones. From what I remember, there were a bunch of people who were excited about this because it had the mystery label on it, along with word that it looked like Hyouka except not boring. Word of advice my friends. No matter how bad a KyoAni show is, any anime where the phrase \"it looks like this KyoAni show except actually good\" can be applied to it will always turn out bad. No exception.\\n\\n\r\nAnd Beautiful Bones is pretty damn bad. It's not just the direction that's choppy, but the storytelling is mismanaged as well. For starters, just like the other Fall mystery show, it begins in medias res so it pretty much assumes you already know who our main duo is and thus we're supposed to find it cute when Sakurako guzzles over bones and solves mysteries with a Deus Ex Machina power because that's who she is. And also like that other Fall mystery show, the characters have no personal stakes in regards to any of the cases besides revealing token bits about Sakurako's past, which I'll get to later, so I'm not really sure why I'm supposed to care about them or the mysteries they're involved in.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not sure if Beautiful Bones is worse than The Perfect Insider, but it's definitely not as fun to take the piss on. They both take their premises seriously whilst being horribly paced and completely lacking in tension, but whilst Perfect Insider couldn't stop banging on about how intelligent it is despite not realizing it was playing with a firework that had been soaked in sewer water, Beautiful Bones is sort of comfortable in its own inanity and proceeds to just go about its life like it's nobody's business, wallowing in mediocrity rather than striving to be anything more. There are multiple episode where there's not even a case happening, instead taking time to focus on the characters just going on about their lives despite the fact that I have no reason to care about seeing their lives. And when a case does happen, it's always clumsily executed due to the police being legendarily thick and the motivations being as sensical as Michael Jackson's singing.\\n\\n\r\nNot that Sakurako's or her boy toy's motivations are any better. Beautiful Bones tries to sell us on their relationship as the glue that holds everything together, completely unaware that it's the cheap kind you'd use in elementary school because it's completely lacking. A good relationship-driven show is supposed to have the characters complement each other in a way that drives the story, but Beautiful Bones can't even get as far as to do the complementing in the first place since Shotaro is mostly there to act in awe of Sakurako's skills whilst being her morality pet and personal joke-punching bag whilst Sakurako...just goes on about life as always except now she has a kid hanging around her. Actually, I don't recall what the two do either together or separately other than hang out and solve mysteries. I understand it's supposed to be some Holmes/Watson thing, but Watson had a story. He was an army doctor who just got back from Afghanistan and needed to settle down. We never learn about what Shotaro's deal is until the final episode that details how he and Sakurako first met, and without spoiling anything, let's just say I don't see him going into any war zones soon.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Sakurako herself, the show builds up a story regarding her past and some villain that's manipulating all the cases around her to the point of ridiculousness, because my suspension of disbelief doesn't go so far as to accept that one man can manipulate both the case about a trapped child under a floorboard and the one about a cursed painting considering how little they have to with each other. And all it really tells us is that Sakurako is fragile on the inside. Wow. Great characterization there, Holmes. Not that that's automatically a bad story, but in addition to all the crap surrounding it, when I see buildup happening throughout the course of a show, I expect there to be some fucking payoff! And that's another problem with light novel adaptations by the way: they never end. It's like in order to get your series approved, you have to aim to be some Tolkien epic despite the fact that you don't have nearly the same amount of world-building skills that he did and you never will because you're working in an industry where all talent is to be left at the door when you enter the publisher's office. I'm pretty sure it even spells that fact out in the contract you have to sign with those guys.\\n\\n\r\nSo between a mismanaged cast, shoddy direction, tension-less mysteries, tension-less non-mysteries, and an ending sequence where you leer at Sakurako's naked body for some reason, at the end of the day, the show is basically like an un-sharpened #2 pencil: completely pointless.",

            "content": "The first impression of Sakurako-san is that it gives off the feeling of a show that is purely focused on the mystery genre. In that respect, it reminds many people of how Hyouka was, minus the school life part of it. And yet, comparing Sakurako-san to Hyouka doesn't really do either of the shows justice. Hyouka integrates daily life into its mystery aspects, while one of the main plot points for Sakurako-san is the separation between everyday life and the mystery of the dead.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThe episodic format of Sakurako-san does throw some people off a bit. The uneven pacing between each of the episodes isinfluenced by the fact that each episode focuses on a different case and a different body, with the exception of the three two-episode cases. Some of the cases are chilling, incorporating aspects of the thriller genre in the fairly linear formula of \"character introduction, present problem, gather evidence, formulate conclusion,\" such as the case of The Cursed Man. Some of the cases are drama-filled, detailing the extreme measures that some people are willing to go to for a cause, whether it be life or love, exploring the delicate psyche that is molded and broken in certain people, such as the case of The Butterfly Vanished in November. And then again, some of the cases are genuinely heartfelt and evokes the emotion of sadness and perhaps even nostalgia, as the show tries to connect with its viewers deeper than a superficial and tension-filled setting, and tries to delve deeper into the viewers' psyche by bringing up the true mortality of life and how death comes with the passage of time, no matter the memories or emotions that may be associated with it. An example of this type would be Grandmother's Pudding. And I totally agree that, even though the show is episodic in nature, the discrepancies in pacing does hinder the show's progression, such as the transition of a thrilling episode 5 to an episode 6 that just mostly focuses on character development and focus. While the episodes themselves are brilliantly written and manages to evoke the exact emotions and tension that the director probably wanted, the discrepancies in pacing prevents this category from being a solid 10.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nHonestly, Sakurako-san suffered no graphical or animation hindrances from what I could tell. Maybe that's because I don't have the sharpest eyes for every little detail within a single scene, but I truly believe that the backgrounds and the character designs are extremely competent. I love it when Sakurako's eyes widen or narrow to express her mostly-logical mind's slight emotional outbursts, or how Ume's (the housekeeper) seems so kindly and warm and animated with all of that grandmother-like goodness. Nothing extraordinary done by studio TROYCA with their first time as a lead animation studio, but the visuals were solid nonetheless. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nIf there was background music to this show, it must've been quite minimalistic and non-intrusive since I didn't notice much music within the episodes or during dialogue to really perk my interest. That being said, what background sounds there were, such as a busy cafe or cars going by on a snowy street, sounded well-done and fitting for their roles. The voice actors were quite good, and I especially liked Shizuka Itou's voice for Sakurako, the way her voice drifts up and down to reflect her analyzing personality, and yet having certain raw emotional outbursts at bringing up truly traumatic happenings. As with most animes, an emphasis was placed on the opening theme rather than the closing, and TRUE does a wonderful little pop ballad with electronic influences for \"Dear answer.\" TECHNOBOYS was a little forgettable with the ending, however, and the fact that some episodes went over the ending theme to continue the story didn't help the song to brand itself into my memory either.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\r\nIf this was a normal show with a connected plotline, this score would definitely be lower. However, Sakurako-san runs into the trouble of having already developed characters placed into a world where the norm prevails, and the only anomalies happen to be the dead. This does not prevent Sakurako-san from filling its episodes with interesting and inventive characters, however, such as the cute and caring Yuriko Kougami to the almost nihilistic Itsuki Isokazi. It is unfortunate that Hanabusa, the \"main\" antagonist, wasn't explored almost at all, and was merely defined by the actions of his pawns throughout the episodes. It is exciting, however, to see how a person's psyche can bend and break under certain conditions, such as how Minami was twisted and turned by a contorted form of love, and how Shoutarou finally realizes how his grandmother still cared for him during his last days, giving him a new understanding of what is meant in her actions and her love. Through the episodes, however, the main characters, Sakurako and Shoutarou, fall flat, as Sakurako is continuously haunted by her little brother and maintains an almost sociopathic attitude towards life, while Shoutarou wanders around like a lost dog, behaving in mostly normal ways except for that fact that his actions give off a sense of naive love towards Sakurako. Some aspects of the characters are confusing, like how Hitoe's mind finally broke and how does Shoutarou actually feels towards his archetypal \"older sister.\" Nevertheless, the characters are still well done, even with flaws, firmly being granted a 7.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nWhile I have stated that character development isn't as huge an issue in episodic shows, the combination of slightly flat protagonists and an uneven pacing between even episodic plot structures leaves a man (or woman) wanting more out of this show. On top of that, the show leaves off on a cliffhanger, which is an absolutely horrible note in my book if the show has not been greenlit for a second season. That means that anime watchers may never truly know the fate of Hanabusa and whether this story is meant to be fatalistic, or optimistic in its views on death, life, and mortality itself.\\n\\n\r\n\"Read the manga!\" \"Read the light novel!\" You'll be reading the bottom of my foot after I kick you out of sheer annoyance.",

            "content": "\u201cBeautiful Bones\u201d or \u201cA Corpse is Buried Under Sakurako\u2019s Feet\u201d is a detective show styled directly upon the classic Sherlock Holmes novels, or at the very least, uses the general setup of Holmes to tell various stories about human mortality, and the various philosophical and moral issues that lie therein.\r\nThe character archetypes should be familiar. Sakurako-san is an eccentric, antisocial rich lady who spends her time studying bones because it is her passion. She is very intelligent, but often comes across as rude because of her honest and analytical nature. Shoutarou, presented as our protagonist, is the foil- a quiet, observative, and domestic high schoolboy who makes up for his lack of studied intelligence with warm kindness and keen eyes. A typical Sherlock and Watson, though Shoutarou is arguably a more competent character than Watson could ever hope to be.\\n\\n\r\nThe visual design is absolutely exactly what it needs to be- dull and uninteresting. No sarcasm here. This is a story that follows Sakurako and Shoutarou as they solve the fairly unpleasant mysteries of human remains they find in their daily lives. Each specific \u201ccase\u201d allows the callous Sakurako and the sentimental Shoutarou to give their opinions and analyses of the causes and morality behind each incident, making for a calm psychological drama/slice of life.\\n\\n\r\nThe appeal in this show is not action, or romance, or substantial drama. It is in the conversations between the characters, and the solving of the mysteries. It often tries to debunk or explain the \u201csupernatural\u201d in order to reveal some truth in the world, and most of it seems factually accurate. A large majority of the mysteries are completely solvable by anyone with the exact specialized knowledge or the observation skills required of analyzing human remains.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is hardly melodramatic, and does not rely on misunderstandings or arguments to carry the plot, and I appreciate the attempt to create an atmosphere of realistic morbid curiosity and investigation. While Sakurako and Shoutarou are extreme characters that likely do not exist in reality, they both have hyperbolized traits that exemplify real human urges. Sakurako represents an innate desire to unearth and understand facts, while Shoutarou seeks sentimental and spiritual peace in order to be morally comfortable with each case.\\n\\n\r\nWith simple visual design, excellent writing, great performances by all the voice actors, and an\u2026 entirely passable musical score, this anime is worth the time of anyone who is willing to sit down and come to terms with death in the context of human society. It, while facetious and pretentious at times, still manages to give realistic and mundane stories that pique a viewer\u2019s interest while also fundamentally remaining in reality. 7.5/10.\\n\\n\r\nNote: People seem to be unfairly disliking this show just because it is episodic. Why does being episodic lower the quality of the show? This is not some drama that is trying to tell a larger story than what is seen in each episode. The concept behind it is to suggest philosophy and opinion behind mortality in modern society, with a fictionalized but realistic setting. It does not need to have a sprawling, grand, \"Oh my god it's all connected!!!\" Part 4 JoJo ending to be a good murder mystery, because it is not trying to be a murder mystery.\\n",

            "content": "So the premise of the show is that it is a mystery and that Sakurako is an osteologist and thus knows a lot about bones and can tell the gender, animal and traumas from it, but the biggest problem with the stories/crime solving is that she magically becomes sherlock holmes at whim. She's suddenly knowledgeable in art. She's suddenly knowledgeable in jewellery. She's suddenly knowledgeable in knot tying. When you never present your character as being a very diversely knowledgeable person from the beginning (like Sherlock from Elementary), everything seems to be resolved by deus ex machina. \r\nNow the show is presented in a fairlyepisodic format. One episode generally has no relevance to its previous one besides character introduction, similar to Elementary. So what makes a mystery show great is that there are often lots of clues given out, some that are later proven to be wrong to the case or some that are proven crucial since the beginning. This show basically has none of that. How the mysteries are resolved is largely Sakurako showing up at the necessary place and everything is solved instantly, letting only the audience see it being told. There's no amazing in-depth explanation or analysis of things, it's really just: I'll show up, have a glance, and now the problem is solved. A little bit of techno-babble would have been great as well as letting the audience see into the life of an osteologist would have been ever better. But as it stands, it really feels like the author thought up an idea then decided to research it on wikipedia and eventually made the summary of it in his story.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a horrible way to present a show, let a lone a mystery. It's boring, it's basically skimped. Let's take a look at another show that does something like this, Mushishi. Now why is this show so much better than Sakurako? It's because there's actually some techno-babble in it along with some developed episodic characters. Most of the episodic characters in Sakurako don't have enough backstory and we're just given a simple exposition explaining their relevance then everything is resorted to melodrama and yelling.\\n\\n\r\nNext, since this is basically Sherlock Holmes, let's compare the two. Now Sherlock has a side-kick, Watson. And basically Shoutarou is Watson in this story. Except for a Watson, he is absolutely irritating and does nothing to contribute to solving the case; in fact it sometimes feels like he's hindering it. Hell, he's more like Watson and the police department mixed together since he ends up bringing the case to Sakurako. Shoutarou is probably one of the worst characters I have seen to date as he basically believes himself more mature than Sakurako but has the obtuseness of a male harem MC at understanding other people's emotions.\\n\\n\r\nSo how does the show feel overall? Well it's a mystery without the interesting mysteries. A dialogue heavy show with very superficial and unintriguing dialogue. The only redeeming thing I can find is the art, I find the character design okay, the background art ranges from industry standard to pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, yes there's some kind of story and it's told in between and kind of at the end of certain episodes (again, sort of like Elementary). Except we're basically left out of the actual story arc and you're either left to wait for season 2 or forced to read the novels.\\n\\n\r\nIn regards to deus ex machinas, Shoutarou is a black belt in whatever style for a single episode so solve that one exclusive case and then it's never heard from again.",

            "content": "*This is my first review.\r\nIn this review, I will go through each core element and give my thoughts as to why you should consider watching this anime. Before I get to that, I would like to say that I describe this anime as \"A crime drama with a lot less unnecessary drama, leading to a more interesting show\". If you happen to find yourself liking shows pertaining to crime, and are intrigued by things of the dead sort and their stories, this show is for you.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThe basic storyline of this anime is simple and very easy to follow. A girl who loves bones, alongwith her assistant solve puzzling mysteries together. It is from this main storyline that lots of interesting scenarios are created. The pacing is not too fast and not too slow; each story has their own episode, with some longer stories taking up to two episodes, which seems like a fair pace to me.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: 8/10 and 8/10\\n\r\nWhen watching an anime, I tend to pay no attention to the music or sound used because we want to focus on the story.Though I may not notice it, sound and art go hand in hand when creating atmosphere, which I think is done quite well in this anime. The art is not exactly to my style, but it was good nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed the different types of characters present in the story, due to their varying personalities, which makes for an interesting viewing. The number of characters in the anime are also just right- too little people make for a boring show; too many can make it confusing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall Impression: 9/10 & 9/10\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed this anime very much, and would highly recommend it to people who like these kinds of anime. Some things could have been done to make it even better, such as the inclusion of more episodes, which would increase the enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nTOTAL SCORE: ~8.67 (Rounded up to 9.0)",

I spent the next 6 months waiting, watching every preview I could find, checking out all the promotional material, I don't think I could have gotten my self anymore hyped up for its release.\r\nAnd I was not disappointed, everything from the character concepts to the animation style is spot on. In a rare and rewarding way, the script writers, voice actors, sound engineers, background artists, in-between animators and very noticeably the key frame animators and the researchers came together and created a coherent and beautiful show.\r\nI really can't praiseit enough, it balances tension with humor, pain and sorrow with truth and facts (Not made up facts either). It plays out like a novel written by someone who knows what they are doing, someone who understands human interaction, understands when foils are needed and when characters should just stand out by themselves.",

Most mysteries were complex and had a lot of suspense,. Another interesting fact was how the mysteries seemed to stretch from simple things like a lost gift to the tragic events such as the death of a mother. Also the atmosphere of the anime screamed out mystery.\r\nThere were some bad parts to the story as well. There are too many parallels to Sherlock Holmes novels, A mastermind(Moriarty in this, Hanabusa) manipulatingthe protagonist behind the scenes, being the root of most of the detectives cases .Also the cursed man seemed oddly familiar to the Hounds of the Baskervilles. Another problem is the unsatisfying ending, We got so much build up about hanabusa and then nothing after that but the ending wasn't that bad it showed how Sherlock... sorry I mean Sakurako and Shoutaru met. Finally we didn't much background Sakurako our protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nArt:9\\n\r\nThe show had a bright and expansive color palette, making the art sublime especially the cherry trees.\\n\r\nBut I do have a complaint, was the resemblance of the characters to the characters in Aldnoah.Zero.\\n\\n\r\nSound:6\\n\r\nThe opening was the only thing memorable for from the soundtrack and also the music from Sakurako's over the top \"lets solve the mystery \" scene. Except those none of the other track seemed significant \\n\\n\r\nCharacters :7\\n\r\nThe character development and the relationships between the characters are well established. As most main characters get some development throughout the series. Sakurako who can be initially seen as heartless is actually a much more caring character. Shoutaru on the other hand is your run of the mill kind person with a black belt. Yuri and her grandmothers relation is one of the standouts among the character interactions.\\n\r\nThen there are the flaws. Again the Sherlock parallels\\n\r\nSherlock Holmes-Sakurako, a sociopath who acts like they don't care for others, whilst they actually do, also both have an unhealthy obsession(many for Sherlock)\\n\r\nDr. Watson - Shoutaru, a normal person, who wants action in his life meets a detective who can help with that.\\n\r\n... and so on\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:8\\n\r\nAfter reading detective novels, watching multitudes of tv series and a couple of movies a detective anime is always enjoyable\\n\\n\r\nI wont drag this on any farther so this the end of the review\\n",

            "content": "Sakurako-san is another one of those unfortunate anime which could potentially have been really good had it just done a few things differently, but instead sadly ends up fumbling upon itself thanks to a handful of slip-ups. It's quite similar to Hyouka as far as its theme and plot progression goes, but the pacing is significantly worse.\r\nThe story follows a normal high school boy named Shoutarou who has a not-so-normal friend called Sakurako. She has an unhealthy addiction to bones of all things, and finds it fascinating to study their history. By some strange coincidence, whenever the two of them are together they just sohappen to get themselves accidentally involved in numerous bizarre cases, usually where a corpse or a skeleton is found and they have to figure out its story. So it's a mystery anime, which is definitely something I appreciate since we don't get to see too many of them nowadays, and it's also one of the more interesting genres in fiction in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately however, Sakurako-san is not what I would call a \"satisfying\" mystery anime. The reasons being a) it's episodic, and b) it's rushed. All of the cases in this anime are resolved in either 1 or 2 episodes, resulting in a myriad of short stories instead of a longer ongoing problem. And quite frankly this is a very bad thing for a series of this genre. Think about it; a complete mystery story needs:\\n\\n\r\n1. A foundation to establish the setting of the case\\n\r\n2. A problem to be solved needs to pop up (like a murder for example)\\n\r\n3. The detective must look around for clues\\n\r\n4. After all the clues have been gathered, the detective must be given time to think about them and try to put the puzzle together (which of course lets the viewers do so as well at the same time)\\n\r\n5. The case must now be solved, the truth brought to light and, if possible, the culprit arrested\\n\r\n6. Finally everything must be wrapped up and the aftermath of the entire incident presented\\n\\n\r\nSo all-in-all, that's quite a lot of ground to cover. In fact, that's way too much ground to cover in just 1-2 anime episodes. There's simply not enough time to go through all the steps properly without either rushing it completely or making the mystery so simplistic that it's not even interesting to begin with. And this is the main problem with Sakurako-san as an anime, namely that it time and time again tries to do too much in too little time.\\n\\n\r\nInstead it almost feels like the anime is trying to cheat the system by skipping a step or two. The whole investigation and pondering phases are almost cut off completely. How? Well simply by making Sakurako be absurdly overpowered as a detective. By that I mean to say that it doesn't matter whether the case in question ends up revolving around human biology, psychology, chemistry or 19th century painting techniques; no matter what it is, Sakurako knows everything. She can figure out any mystery within minutes with almost no clues to work with. In other words:\\n\\n\r\na) Every case ends up feeling very unimportant due to how quickly and easily they are solved\\n\r\nb) It gives the viewer almost no time to think for themselves (which is without a doubt the #1 most important thing in a detective story so this is a huge problem)\\n\r\nc) There is very little semblance of tension since you always know that Sakurako is going to save the day within the next minute no matter what\\n\r\nd) It significantly lowers the story's sense of realism as it doesn't really feel believable a lot of the time\\n\r\ne) As soon as a mystery is resolved, we're back to the status quo again. In other words it kind of feels like the story doesn't even matter in the long run. Although there are brief tie-ins to previous story arcs on rare occasions, it's not anything particularly noteworthy\\n\\n\r\nSo I've talked a lot about Sakurako, but what about Shoutarou, our supposed protagonist? Well... there really isn't a whole lot to say about him. He's just \"there\" as a sidekick, and Sakurako is the one always dragging him along and calling the shots. It's almost like his sole purpose in the show is to be someone for Sakurako to show off to. There are also a bunch of other characters in the show, but they're about as forgettable as it gets. Really the entire anime revolves around Sakurako herself and no one else, which would be common for a detective series, but given that she's hardly what I'd call a well-written detective for a mystery story I still can't consider it a good thing.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end though, despite the fact that there are tons of issues with Sakurako-san as an anime, they all stem from the exact same source. The heart of the problem is quite simply that the total episode count is *way* too small. They should have taken the same amount of content and adapted it in maybe 24 episodes instead of compressing it into merely 12. Everything comes down to that. The rushed pacing means that every mystery story gets way too little exposition and instead they have to fill the holes by using Sakurako as a cheat code, enabling them to skip out on half the steps in every arc. That's like a band aid measure, it doesn't actually resolve the problem itself whatsoever. What makes the mystery genre so fascinating is the process of solving the matter at hand; you investigate for clues, try your best to put them together, and then finally present the solution. Sakurako-san however basically skips out on all that and just blatantly gives you the answer right away. Talk about taking just about all the fun out of it.\\n\\n\r\nWith all that being said, Sakurako-san is still a decent anime which might be worth checking out. It just annoys me because I sincerely believe that it could have been really damn good had it just been paced better (or not been episodic to begin with), but instead we're left with an incredibly flawed final product. Good mystery anime are quite rare to come by, so it saddens me when a series like this pops up with all the potential in the world, only to fall flat for a quite needless reason.",

Personally I thought it had a really great story, character (to a certain extent) and a good sense of enjoyment. Sakurako-san no Ashimoto ni wa Shitai ga Umatteiru is maybe a 7.0 out of 10 on the dark story meter. What I mean by that is the story focuses a lot (judging by if you read the title of the show lol) bones, death dead bodies etc. There is horror in it, however it is natural horror, it's not like an all in your face look atthe bones look at the dead bodes blah blah horror that we usually see in anime's like this one. Another thing I liked about the story was the pacing. Overall the stories pacing of events going on are slow, however the writers do a great job of making this slow pace less annoying by adding additional mystery or mysterious elements. For example they will throw in a detective setting to keep things interesting, like \"what was the motive for this murder?\" etc. The music is \"fitting\" for the show. It is the type of music you what expect to hear in a show that revolves around death and mystery. Lastly, the art. The art style used in the show looks like something from late 2010's so nothing too special to point out other than Sakurako is kind of hot. Overall I think this show would be great for anyone to watch in their spare time however I do not think it's for everyone. Overall I give it 9/10 for that nostalgic sense of mystery and wonder.",

            "content": "I wanted to make this review because of my \u201chatred\u201d for this series. Sakurako-san too long of a name that I can\u2019t remember like, almost, every other light novel name is a pretty bad show, why is it a bad show you may ask? Several reasons.\r\nStory\r\nWhat can I say about the story? There is absolutely no story, it's just a \"bone of the week\" show. This show is more so an episodic mystery than a full on series mystery, because of the \u201cepisodic nature\u201d the mysteries solved in the show are, in the long run, completely pointless and doesn\u2019t mean squat to the overall \"plot\"since they are pretty much forgotten about, oh sure they remember the events but how much did that affect the story and the characters? None.\\n\\n\r\nThough I say this is an \u201cepisodic series\u201d there are three mini-arcs that have the mystery case stretched out to 2 episodes so it doesn\u2019t count as an episodic show, right? Since it has a story? Wrong, it is still episodic even if it has mini-arcs because majority of all episodic shows have stories put right in at the end or as it gradually builds up to it. This show does no such thing, it doesn\u2019t lead to a grand conclusion, it doesn\u2019t build upon one another it\u2019s just forgotten. Oh but they reference the previous cases, so you are wrong! It\u2019s as I said in the above passage, it did not in anyway affect the characters, nor did it the story, they don't learn from it and take anything away from it.\\n\\n\r\nWhere this show fails is the mystery aspect or should I even call it a mystery? This so-called \u201cmystery\u201d is solved only in a matter of one episode, you can even say in a millisecond before the show even begins, so the three mini-arcs are just useless, like I said, why are they useless? I\u2019m glad you (didn\u2019t) ask, they are useless because of how they are handled, typically, in a proper mystery the main character would have to do some, you know, it\u2019s a really fascinating little thing that I like to call, investigating, this \u201cinvestigating\u201d thing is quite something it helps build the mystery and makes us learn about the mystery, the motives, and the overall conclusion to said mystery, what does this show have? A hacks main character that knows everything, there, problem solved! We can go home now!\\n\\n\r\nAlso there is some brief fan-service that is just very questionable, why was it there? What was the purpose? How much were they thinking when they made this? Why didn\u2019t the creator make a proper mystery, since the \u201cfan-service\u201d was more interesting than the rest of this show, sure it\u2019s only in two, or so, episodes but it just out of place and takes away from the show, and is the only interesting thing going on, you have to pander somehow, right?\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound\\n\r\nDA PRETTY COLORS! 1000/10!\\n\r\nDespite being a mystery show the colors were oddly bright, it didn\u2019t fit the presentation and comes off as \u201coff-putting\u201d. The art is still good, despite not matching the overall tone of the show, it is just weird. The colors also take away from the atmosphere of the show, unless you just like the pretty colors then you should have no problem with it, this is suppose to be a mystery so you typically expect darker shades of colors but with this it's too bright.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening song is quite nice, nothing noteworthy, it\u2019s just nice. The ending song is decent. The OST is pretty forgettable since it doesn\u2019t stick out it is just more of a background thing, like it should be, though I feel disappointed on that part. Voice acting? It was alright, voices matched, kind of. Overall I have no real problem with the sound, but wait, the voice actor for Shoutarou didn't match him, it felt too \"deep\", I don't something about it just doesn't sit right.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nWith the cast of characters that we are presented to are pretty poorly written. We have an idiotic policeman that just doesn\u2019t do anything on his own he is just that very annoying character, but he isn\u2019t around long, though his presence currently ruins the mood. We also have a teacher, a teacher, a teacher, it really sounds weird when I think about it, I mean what purpose did he even serve besides being relevant for the last mini-arc in which he isn\u2019t even developed, which is another problem with the characters, they aren\u2019t developed at all! One last character is the schoolgirl, she was a useless \u201clove interest but not really love interest\u201d for the secondary main character, she got her own episode, which was just a GIANT waste of time, that I thought of dropping the show since it was just a waste of time, filler if you will, well anyways she is, I guess, the only developed character? So yay?\\n\\n\r\nOkay now I\u2019m done with the side characters let\u2019s get into the main characters. Let\u2019s start with the secondary main character, Shoutarou Tatewaki or \u201cShounen\u201d (Boy), he is just a very bland character, there is really nothing to him that makes him stand out, he is basically the audience, just there for the \u201cride\u201d. With the last episode how he met Sakurako it was just very cringe worthy, it just didn\u2019t sit right with me. And he also strong? As in physically strong, which kind of came out of nowhere.\\n\\n\r\nSakurako Kujou, I hate her bone fetish, it\u2019s just cringy, why are you so fascinated with bones? That's an easy joke right there. Also, what irritates me about her is that she is just the hacks main character; all she does is ruin the \u201cmystery\u201d aspect the show claims it has, why? The purpose of a mystery is to be, well, mysterious! A mystery is what makes the character guess, investigate and piece together what goes with what, but no, she knows EVERYTHING in the universe, which ruins everything since there is no engagement to the show. Hey why not ask her who really assassinated JFK? The show tries to give a \u201climit\u201d to her hacks power by her saying \u201cOh I don\u2019t know everything\u201d or something like that, so what? The mystery was already broken the moment the show started, more specifically, when she was introduced, so that little limit was pointless, just stop show, please.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion, the characters aren\u2019t written properly, in fact, I dare say they are poorly written. Crazy, right?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nI hate this show, but I enjoy it for how bad the show is, but I had to will my way through this show like a Shounen protagonist that wills their way through the big fight against the big baddie. I also hate it for how much this show tries to be \u201cserious\u201d. This show also got to the point to where it was very very cringy to watch, I just didn\u2019t want to sit in my seat anymore, but I was just forcing myself, the cringe is real with this one. One thing I would like to know is, why did they stop the magical girl transformation thing that happened in the earlier episodes when she said \u201cNow, let\u2019s solve the mystery\u201d it was just brilliantly stupid, oh look they play it at the end of the show, thank you, it still incredibly dumb but amazing! The best thing to take out of this show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nThe mystery is a giant letdown; the engagement is just very low. The characters are poorly written in the way it presents them. Sakurako-san is a pretentious anime that tried to be smarter than it actually is and tried to sound smarter than it actually was, way more than its own good. This show is a try-hard show, it tries way to hard to be serious, more serious than it really should have been. Overall, Sakurako-san is a bad series, just a plain bad series, I would not recommend unless you--you know what there are a lot more better mystery shows out there, I wouldn't tell you to watch this even as a joke since this requires will power to go through, so I recommend to go out and watch an actual good mystery rather than this pseudo intellectual show. This show is just bad and gets a 2.5/10 rating, nothing less nothing more, I don't want to have to do anything with this show for as long as I may live.",

            "content": "Her name isn\u2019t Sherlock Holmes but that doesn\u2019t mean Sakurako can\u2019t solve mysteries. Beautiful Bones: Sakurako\u2019s Investigations, a series based off of the light novel, is a TV anime adaptation that takes place in Asahikawa City. The main female protagonist is a beauty named Sakurako Kujo with an intellect and fascination for bones. She specializes her time in studying bones and examines them like a form of art. Behind those bones usually lies a mystery whether it\u2019d be the remains of an animal or human.\r\nIn essence, the series is a mystery adventure. Almost every episode opens up to a story and reads like a bookwhere we get the introduction of a case, the problem, clues, and resolution. Key players in each mystery case has some direct or indirect connection to the series\u2019 themes. Throughout the show, family has been a key element as we often see how cases relate to deceased relatives and their effects on loved ones. Sakurako often finds herself involved in mystery cases because of a young boy named Shoutarou. Their relationship is rather strange as well as Sakurako refers Shoutarou often as \u201cboy\u201d rather by his given name. There\u2019s also cryptic flashbacks about Sakurako that suggests she has suffered a tragedy that involved the death of a loved one, perhaps bearing resemblance to Shoutarou. But for the majority of the run, the show runs on the structure of an episodic style where mystery sometimes doesn\u2019t see just eye to eye.\\n\\n\r\nWith the amount of mystery, it\u2019s hard to deny that there\u2019s some pacing issues. The first episode only sets up the general concept of the series while the majority of the remaining ones mostly adapts a non-linear story. However, it still offers enough thoughtful mystery-thriller to hook the audience. This is because every mystery involves bones and as each bone is different, there\u2019s a diverse range of ways the series takes interest about itself. Sakurako\u2019s interest about bones is also highlighted easily with her fascination. She\u2019s the type of woman with a level headed coolness and possesses an intimidating intellect. On the other hand, Shoutarou is more of the typical schoolboy who tries to make a difference. The two are hardly alike but does manage their time together to solve cases. Other prominent characters includes Yuriko, a girl who attends the same school as Shoutarou and sometimes also gets involved with mystery cases. Most of the other characters that we see in the show plays a supporting role that includes a teacher, police officer, or even a family dog. A few of them also gets some characterization but mostly related to the cases. Because the show isn\u2019t really all about the \u2018who\u2019 but rather than the \u2018why\u2019, the characterization of the series is generally dense. \\n\\n\r\nMystery shows like this is also crafted by its thrilling atmosphere. There are some episodes that are prime examples of this such as the case of \u201cThe Cursed Man\u201d. Then, there are some rather sincere cases about family like the one about Yuriko\u2019s grandmother. This can be a hit or a miss and sometimes can feel distracting. As I\u2019ve mentioned before, pacing of the show is really a nag. At times, it offers a twisty, stylistic mystery with promise while other times leaves disappointment in the eyes of a boring resolution. It still relies on some old school mystery formula and recycled ideas that isn\u2019t so thrilling. This doesn\u2019t help by Shoutarou\u2019s personality as he is a guy with little characterization but plays as more of a supporting player at each case. Sakurako is also a character that is quite mysterious from the very start. Throughout some episodes, she sometimes gets moments that triggers her past memories. As the show progresses, I think it\u2019s safe to say that sometimes, it\u2019s more about coping with death rather than mysteries themselves. It offers a more realistic side for this show as well as an emotional one based on character stories. It can even feel like the time when you find an old picture album in the attic and appeal with a sense of nostalgia. At other times, the show retorts to its comedic side with some humorous scenarios and dialogues. By general means, the comedy feels pretty natural through conversations. And finally, don\u2019t expect much romance. While the promotional poster seems to look like a teaser, there really isn\u2019t love story angle. \\n\\n\r\nProduced by Troyca, this is their first independent project. Previously, they\u2019ve worked on Aldnoah Zero so do expect some character designs to look familiar such as the case of Shoutaro. But on a visual front, the series is pretty well crafted. Sakurako\u2019s character design is made to look her like a beauty with a haughty personality to reflect her calm nature. The setting also has a serene-like feeling to it with modern decorations and a few noticeable scenes are colored like an art. Prime examples of this includes Sakurao\u2019s declaration when she decides to solve a case. Facial tones are generally standard that expresses their personalities. And finally, we got the bones. While I\u2019m not an expertise at examining bone specimen, I think it\u2019s easy to tell that the show makes them look credible with their structure. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the soundtrack isn\u2019t anything special, it does carry a quiet atmosphere throughout the show. The series may be a mystery but most of the time retains a style that fits with its lighthearted OST. The OP and ED theme songs also gives away some symbolism with hints about Sakurako. I would say that perhaps Sakurako\u2019s voice is the most distinctive in the show. She displays a sharp tongue with an intimidating voice when involved with cases or bones. When she\u2019s not involved, there\u2019s mostly an indifference about her voice tone. Shizuka Ito translates her character well into the show by bringing the personality of a detective to life.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not a spellbound mystery or literature crafted from Sherlock Holmes\u2019 detective stories. This series stands out more as a mystery that deals with the coping of lost life. Bones is the reminiscence deceased, a physical aspect that serves proof of their existence. And when someone discovers that, it can feel a bit nerve wrecking. What this show does makes it look less malevolent but rather thrilling as each bone has a story behind it. Whether you take that mystery as a successful way of storytelling may be a bit of hit or miss. In retrospect though, this show rides on its premise well with a mixed bag for presentation.",

            "content": "I really wanted to like this show, I really did. There are a lot of problems here and things that make me uncomfortable. I give most shows decent scores even if it had a lot of problems but Sakurako is something else entirely. I guess i'll explain. \r\nCharacters 2: \r\nThere are only two characters that are important, or maybe it's only one character that is important at all. Anyways, the 'heroine' the show is named after, Sakurako Kujou, is an Osteologist, meaning she studies and collects bones. She is obsessed with finding corpses of animals and humans so that she can add their bones toher collection. She also has a knack for being right about everything with little to no evidence other than. explanations to come.\\n\\n\r\nMale lead who we follow Shoutarou is in every single way an average high school kid who ends up tagging along with Sakurako everywhere she goes. He doesn't do anything helpful, he is typically there just to help Sakurako express what she is thinking in a conversation so that we, the audience, can understand what she is saying. \\n\\n\r\nPlot 3:\\n\\n\r\nThere is no main plot going on in the show early on, it first starts off as the leads finding a corpse on the beach. Sakurako understands everything within 30 seconds of seeing the corpse, the police and everybody around her immediately believe her and take her words as fact. Unfortunately there is no connection between this case and the next, and the next, and the next. They are all random cases that don't connect at all, it's very episodic and Sakurako solves every problem with her expansive knowledge that she apparently inherits from studying bones.\\n\\n\r\nWe see the strings attempting to tie up all the mysteries, that happened before, near the last few episodes. Is somebody behind these murders? If so what is their reasoning for doing this? We will never know, because before the leads find any clues towards finding the antagonist the show ends abruptly without solving anything. Why did I watch this show that is going to leave on such a big cliff hanger, when it isn't a very good show in the first place. It's not like Shokugeki no Souma which was an extremely good show that left on a cliffhanger. This show wasn't all that great from start to finish. \\n\\n\r\nArt 7:\\n\r\nSound 7: \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 3: \\n\\n\r\nI didn't enjoy it, even though I planned on giving it a 6 or 7 if it finished strongly. Unfortunately that did no happen. I was willing to overlook that, while in custody, she was able to make a police officer stop the car and allow her to help with a case about a murder. She could tell you everything about a person's personal life just by looking at their bones. I didn't mind her being absurdly over intelligent for no real reason in attempts to enjoy this show but I didn't. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 3: \\n\\n\r\nIf you can overlook plot holes and mary sue leads, then this is the perfect show for you.",

            "content": "sakurako-san no ashimoto is an average mystery show that many people find it to be boring. it is adapted from an LN of the same name and aired in 2015 fall along with subete ga F ni naru. these two shows of this season somehow didn't pick the interest of many people, and even if they did, they were immediately dropped after the few pilot episodes. as for the reason Sakurako-san no ashimoto wasn't appreciated that much by the viewers, i personally can't answer this question. simply because i fail to find any noticeable flaw that would drive me to drop it.\r\nthe story of SSAhas adapted an episodic pattern, where every episode we get to discover new cases along with their background story and solution. the show should be able to exhibit its nature only in the first pilot episode. every day the main protagonist highschooler join up with sakurako the osteologist after a long day of school. they depart for different places (forest, beach..) and dig up every possible corner in search for rare bones. however for some unknown reason, they always end up finding human corps. that's how the mystery cases set off.\\n\\n\r\nwhile these mysterious aspects may be considered as elementary level compared to other series -the situation is not very complicated if you ask a \"detective Conan\" fan-, the show hands us all the required information to resolve the case right at the beginning. in other words, anyone would be able to find out the truth only by combining the puzzle piece he was given at the start. but yet, i doubt many viewers were able to do so. not until sakurako enters the scene, divulge all the secrets and finally closes the curtains as if nothing had happened. as a result, the whole event starts to look dull and simple.\\n\\n\r\nthe pacing of the series is definetly one of the decisive privileges that makes the one judge if the series is either boring or exciting. the pacing of SSA is very fast. that doesn't mean that it skips some important details.  for a better explanation, let's say every episode is divided into two parts. the first part is where the main cast discovers a body or get dragged into the troublesome situation, it barely lasts for 5 to 8 minutes. and throughout this part, sometimes it is possible to deduct what's going on and find out the truth. then comes the second part that lasts for the rest of the episode and surprisingly feels rushed. the events escalate quickly, the situation becomes more intense until finally everything gets wrapped up as a conclusion. personally, i find this quick pacing to be perfect for a show of this nature. while other people may disagree justifying that it doesn't give a chance to the viewer to keep up with what's going on, i say that slowing down would result in the show being boring instead. the ultimate goal of the series is giving prominence to sakurako's intelligence and driving us to admire her while she resolves different mysteries and makes them look as a piece of cake.\\n\\n\r\ndespite SSA's fast pacing and episodic nature, there are some stories that take up to two episodes. the mystery is far more complicated and most importantly the sphenoider (I'll be talking about him later) is usually the mastermind behind it. the conclusion of this episodes often saves us some exciting cliff-hangers making the viewer anticipate for more.\\n\\n\r\nleaving the mystery aspect aside, this time, let's talk about what does this show's romance holds for us. a 15 years old high schooler possessing a one-sided love for a women in her middle twenties, sakurako. if i had to count every show i know of that covers this kind of relationship it would be only one (garden of words). that's how rare romance featuring two partners of totally different ages is, especially if the guy is the younger. unfortunately, their relationship didn't develop in the least throughout the whole 12 episode, since apparently, SSA doesn't recognize the so-called \"character development\" between main characters. shoutarou who likes sakourako, and sakourako who likes bones, nothing will change that much.\\n\\n\r\nspeaking of bones, sakurako is an osteologist. it is natural for her to be interested in bones. however, her love for them gradually switches from being a peculiar interest to become a frightening, creepy and unstable fetish. despite her taciturn attitude, charming appearance and intelligence, she got quite a childish character, as an example her mood reverses over meaningless things, throwing tantrums whenever she's angry, needless to mention her love for cake and pudding. and then the poor shoutaro, MC and narrator. compared to her he's the complete opposite, totally normal and kinda mature for his age. the poor guy, he hardly deals with his crush's depraved hobby only to get a chance to spend more time in her side. along with his narration and simple character we always get to observe the events through different perspectives. wich again adds up another reason to not get bored.\\n\\n\r\nnow check this: there aren't many side characters in the show. approximately 4 prominent ones. all of them got their own stories, their past was revealed and most essentially we got to see a huge development in some of them. yet no development for the main cast and no considerable development in the plot. what does that mean? the show certainly alluded small details about sakurako's dark secret. in the end of most episodes, after the ending song we could see her talking to herself and blurting some strange lines, or talking to someone in the hospital. honestly, it feels as if she made a contract with a demon, and now she's waiting for her death. but in the end, nothing is revealed. same applies with the sphenoider. he is declared to be a dangerous criminal sakurako is trying to catch, the \"abyss\". but guess what? nothing happened that deserves mentioning either. indeed, the last episode was spent looking back at shoutaro and sakurako's first reunion, however, it is absolutely not the perfect time to promote such a thing. it feels as if all these 11 episodes were for naught, as if we're back to the zero point, and i personally find it to be a bummer, really unfortunate.\\n\\n\r\nthe visuals, in the other hand, are an aspect i can definitely rely on for covering up for the plot's lack of progression. the show's first episode was set in spring, displaying the dazzling scenery of the pink sakura blossoms along with green trees. the exposition of natural scenery in SSA is without a doubt one of its strongest points. especially when the biggest part in the show occurs in such places. surprisingly the bones were also carefully animated. when sakurako starts explaining the victim's characteristic only by examining the remains of the corpse, the bones are not professionally drawn, but at least, it's done with enough details to understand and keep up with what she's saying.\\n\\n\r\nthe opening and ending song are certainly entertaining to listen to, but they carry more than just that. sakurako's obscure past wich was not revealed in the end, are also hinted throughout the visuals display. while the OSTs are nothing noteworthy it still succeeds in fitting with the theme of the events, however not very thrilling as they should feel in some particular situation. shoutarou and sakurako's voice were nicely played. especially shootaround's voice. it was a perfect match for his mature character in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nto conclude it all, let's say that SSA is the slice of life mystery show that lacks romance. getting into it holding these same expectations would make it a very enjoyable watch with no exaggeration, as it did with me. kinda. but if you're looking for something more plot-heavy, a show that knows how to progress a story and how to develop the main characters, then better switch to something else (maybe subete ga f ni naru). you can go ahead and drop it in the first few episode too, while complaining how boring it is. just keep in mind that sakurako-san no ashimoto ni wa shitai ga umatteiru is an anime made for slice of life lovers, as an out-breather from similar melodramatic and school life shows.\\n",

Some people had a problem with the story's pacing but I found this to be a strong positive point of the show. The way that most episodes slowed down and focused on mundane tasks or doing favors for friends such as Kougami grounded the show with a strong sense of realism for me. I don't need grand, over-the-top flashy action scenes or high-octane, intense thrills. This show understands that death doesn't need to be flashy, it can have a soothing aura to it as well. This show heavily focuses onthe theme of death, and it presents it as something that doesn't need to be feared, sometimes it brings people closer together. This show is full of real human beings and their unique stories and I loved it so much. But for all of you who wanted a ridiculous killing spree of a series maybe you'll get that in the second season.",

As this is the second mystery anime of the season that I've seen; it's hard to not compare Sakurako and Perfect Insider- as disparately as the way they tell their stories and treat their characters are. A quick way to put it would be that the show watches a lot like \"Bones\" mixed with \"Castle\" and some \"Law and Order SVU\". Mostly the first two. \r\nSakurako focuses on two characters- a high school kid named Shoutarou, and the bourgeoisie, genius young lady that he hangs out with- the eponymous Sakurako.A few major supporting characters also float in and out- Utsumi the cop, Yuri, a schoolmate of Shoutarou's, Isozaki, a teacher at their school, and Sakurako's grandma- the chillest, sassiest, every-one's-grandma ever. Their stories are mostly arc based, or they simply appear as contacts or random happenings as the story progresses. \\n\\n\r\nWhat's interesting about Sakurako and Shoutarou's relationship is how inverse it really seems, especially to outsiders. Sakurako, despite her nearly royal upbringing, is probably 23 going on 3 years old. She has terrible social cues, a temper,  is openly rude to nearly everyone, and has a penchant for speaking her mind, no matter to whom, or what about- much to the chagrin of Shoutarou. \\n\r\nShoutarou on the other hand is more of a father figure in the relationship with Sakurako, despite being her junior by as many as 10 years. He acts practically as her handler and mouthpiece, particularly when dealing with the police- a group whose attention she often attracts with her obsession with acquiring bones, even if it meant stealing state evidence in a homicide investigation. It's obvious that Shoutarou has the hots for Miss Bones, even if  she doesn't seem to reciprocate those romantic feels. Shoutarou is a bit bland for a protagonist, but his even and mellow personality reflect the petulant little tyrant that Sakurako wants to be- often with humorous results. They balance each other out pretty well.\\n\\n\r\nOne point that I found interesting is that though Sakurako involves high school age kids, they're not the real focal point of the show, and neither does the show include a bunch of mundane and pointless scenes taking place in the local high school. I appreciate that, a lot. In fact, the setting for Sakurako is as off beat as its eponymous character, being that the series takes place in Hokkaido, the northernmost part of Japan, bordering Russia. As such, it involves a lot of coastal, mountainous, and forested areas, vs the typical urban environment of school-set anime. This lends itself to some beautiful natural vistas, homes, and generally a more rustic feel.\\n\r\nThis is the first solo production the new studio TROYCA has undertaken, and I felt they did a great job with production values for what's an average of average budgeted anime. \\n\\n\r\nSakurako being a mystery anime, it would be against my nature to spoil the plot for anyone, so I have to say that anyone reading who's not seen the show should see it for themselves (see this as my recommendation), but I have to comment on the way the story presents itself. What's seemingly an episodic sort of slice of life about Shoutarou tagging along with Sakurako places and them happening to come upon bones (sometimes human) in their travels- along with Sakurako helping Shoutarou solve people's mysterious happenings/deaths/etc. By the end of the show, what seemed like loose ends and random dead end plot points manage to connect with some red threads with a pretty thrilling conclusion, if a bit expected. If I were to say one thing about Sakurako- it's a bit more clever than it looks plotwise, for a show about a woman whose near boundless intellect enables her to solve the murder or medical malady of nearly anyone. \\n\\n\r\nSome would say that Sakurako herself is a huge deus ex machina with her sometimes implausible amount of intellect and knowledge that enable her to solve crimes with very few clues, but as a viewer, I was also coming to some of the same conclusions she was, given the same amount of time. This isn't an excuse for breaking \"show, not tell\", but it wasn't a Light Yagami VS L level of jumping to seemingly illogical conclusions only to be right. Sakurako stays grounded, even though the titular character sometimes feels like she has a supernatural mind. \\n\\n\r\nThe biggest issue with Sakurako's story is certainly the length. If Sakurako were a two cour series, it would be able to make a lot better use of time, because the pacing is, at times, so fast that it almost feels like an abbreviated form of a mystery. In one episode you'll have a setup and introduction, exposition, and then have the mystery solved. That's a lot of progression for 24 minutes, and as such it feels rushed. The arcs that take up two episodes feel a lot more natural and the extended length of time gievs the audience more time to hypothesize and try to figure the mystery out for themselves vs just being directly told by Sakurako.\\n\\n\r\nIf the show had more room to stretch its legs, I imagine that it would be a heck of a lot better, as it ended leaving me wanting more. It's likely that as recent as Sakurako is, they simply did not have enough material to animate into a second cour- but with that, I have to say that I will look forward to whatever comes in the future.\\n",

            "content": "(This is a spoiler-free review adapted for this site)\r\n[Synopsis]: High School student Tatewaki Shoutarou (Enoki, Junya) led a normal enough life until he met Kujou Sakurako (Itou, Shizuka), a beautiful, young woman and genius Osteologist who is endlessly fascinated with bones. Together on their outings they always seem to chance upon human remains after which it falls to the unlikely duo to discern the story of the bones and solve the mysteries they present.\r\n[Characters]:\r\nSakurako-san focuses almost entirely on the explorations and interactions of its two protagonists while intermittently featuring recurring supporting characters alongside a primarily episodic cast. The show\u2019s attention to its main characters iswell founded as none of the supporting cast receives much in the way of characterization beyond their own independent installments.\\n\\n\r\nThe first episode of the show does a great job of introducing both Shoutarou and Sakurako \u2013 you get a strong sense of each of their personalities and dynamic of their relationship. Shoutarou is typical enough as far as high school students are concerned and his ordinary outlook and design serves as a point of contrast to Sakurako\u2019s stranger perspective on the developments of the show. As a layman he serves as our investigative eyes into Sakurako\u2019s world of bones and murder mysteries. He avoids feeling cliche in a number of ways however perhaps the most interesting is the straightforward nature of his attraction to Sakurako \u2013 the two make great friends outside of the realm of romance and seeing such skin-deep and hormonal elements at play in their relationship was refreshing and unique. While Shoutarou certainly had a place in the show initially it felt like he was quickly dispensed into becoming a sort of straight man in opposition to Sakurako\u2019s outlandish assertions and blunt nature. Its one thing to have him keep her in check and keep the story grounded however something else entirely to simply point out the eccentricities of her behavior as if to remind the audience that her actions are something other than typical.\\n\\n\r\nSakurako on the other hand I felt quite compelling all throughout for a myriad of reasons. For one thing I thought that having a slightly older heroine was refreshing but moreover her personality, a marriage of the smug intellectual with near-childish enthusiasm, was a great deal of fun given her age and vocation. Its always a pleasure to see an emotive, adult character and Sakurako exhibits great reasons for why she acts the way that she does. She is distant emotionally and generally isn\u2019t phased by sentimental attachments which go well with her logical persona. Her brand of morality is slightly warped by her logic and practical mindset but something more human and emotional seems to be stirring under the surface which gives her a wonderfully complex and genuine feeling. To speak to her one fault within the show, it rests outside of her actual characterization and instead with the way in which she interacts with the plot of the show. The first episode does well in establishing her area of expertise \u2013 making her out to be not only fanatical about bones but incredibly knowledgeable about them as well. The problem that arises is that it often feels as if Sakurako is perhaps \u2018too knowing\u2019 at times.\\n\\n\r\nIt is quite well figured that she knows what she does about bodies and murder scenes given her interest in bones and her familial relation to a forensics investigator however when the terrain shifts towards that of the artistic and even the religious she seems to sport the same wicked intellect without skipping a beat. The show occasionally treated her more like a resource of absolute information in order to tell the story instead of an individual with concrete knowledge and expertise. She often became a font of uncommon knowledge rather than a character with intellectual limitations. Little is done to lampshade this character trait and so its awkward presence goes more or less unanswered within her overall characterization.\\n\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]:\\n\\n\r\nI quite enjoyed the visuals of Sakurako-san and the first episode opens with an exciting sequence of animation and colors. The character designs and some of the environments are highly reminiscent of TROYCA\u2019s other work Aldnoah.Zero however I felt that Sakurako-san gave a familiar aesthetic new life. Its definitely safe to say that the show is very pretty \u2013 it has a great variety of colors and plenty of wonderful scenery ranging from incredibly detailed houses to vibrant forests.\\n\\n\r\nSomething I felt Sakurako-san did especially well was animating facial expressions and character movement which were used effectively to convey emotions and add some much appreciated legitimacy to the actions and behaviors of otherwise plain, supportive characters as well as the main cast. Another minor thing to note relates back to Shoutarou\u2019s seemingly adolescent attraction to Sakurako as discussed above. The show hardly busies itself with fan-service however the camera work surrounding Shoutarou\u2019s perception of her I thought was an intelligent addition to the show and their chemistry. The camera shots of Sakurako\u2019s cleavage and exposed stomach in different episodes do a great job of emphasizing his surface-level, sexual attraction to her. These scenes avoid feeling like true fan service due to their highly intermittent presence and inconsequential nature but present what I thought was a refreshingly straightforward take on a characters attraction to someone else.\\n\\n\r\n[Story]:\\n\\n\r\nLike many mystery shows before it, Sakurako-san unfolds in a fairly episodic manner with the majority of the episodes being standalone stories of Shoutarou and Sakurako\u2019s adventures. The two certainly share something resembling a Sherlockian dynamic though Shoutarou may leave a bit to be desired in this comparison while Sakurako measures up quite well given her ability to pick out minute details concerning the bones they discover. The show at first seemed interested in developing certain themes such as stagnation and the passage of time however I felt these things were quickly forgotten after the first episode and though the final episode attempts to resurrect these ideas they appear highly non-relevant and jumbled.\\n\\n\r\nThe early episodes I felt were enjoyable and the manner in which Sakurako went about solving the mysteries felt unique and interesting because of how she derived most of the information from the bones she found. I remember episode 4 particularly well as it was quite slow paced and very methodical in its detailing and conversation which made the character interactions and behaviors feel especially realistic. My main gripe with the plot of the show is in how, even early on, it begins to establish something more overarching and significant than the individual mysteries but never finds the time to actually capitalize on that area of the story. There appears to be something linking together many of the victims and situations that Sakurako and Shoutarou encounter but rather than building up the eventual conflict with minor details scattered throughout and delivering a final, more imperative story in respect to the show\u2019s main characters, it simply peters out without addressing anything.\\n\\n\r\nNormally I would at least somewhat forgive a show in Sakurako-san\u2019s position if it were simply a case of the show not having enough time to tell the story that it wanted to however given a handful of episodes that I didn\u2019t feel were all that interesting or even relevant in the midsection of the show I can\u2019t help but feel it squandered what time it had. Some episodes for instance were of no import to the characterization of the protagonists or the overarching mystery behind many of their adventures. These would feel far more at home in the show had it not split its ambition in this way and proceeded either concisely with a significant end in mind or purely on a standalone basis without attempting to develop something greater than itself. This isn\u2019t to condemn the show\u2019s episodic nature due to its inability to deliver something of greater import before the end because I think a majority of the episodes were entertaining in and of themselves.\\n\\n\r\nTo make matters somewhat worse, the show ends on a somewhat odd note \u2013 not in the cliffhanger sense but rather it left me feeling as if the episode could have been utilized better. It focused primarily on Shoutarou and a dilema of his that didn\u2019t have much prefacing within the show or even much reason to give it consequence. The show arrives at a somewhat disappointing conclusion after eluding to a figure behind the otherwise independent events of the show and just before pulling back the curtain greets the viewer with a contextual flashback episode that attempts to answer questions that were never asked in the first place. The episode itself is alright in respect to the characters however it felt as if it could have taken place at any time during the show.\\n\\n\r\n[Music]:\\n\\n\r\nThe show\u2019s soundtrack was pretty enjoyable all throughout and matched the show\u2019s atmosphere and subject matter well though, outside of its main theme which seemed to reappear at some point every episode, I didn\u2019t feel any of the music was too memorable.\\n\\n\r\n[Final Thoughts and Rating]: \\n\\n\r\nSakurako-san was a show that initially had me quite excited because of its early episodes, Sakurako\u2019s characterization, and her chemistry with Shoutarou. While the mysteries were fairly interesting there was an unpleasant tendency exhibited by the plot where it would wrap back around to supporting characters it had already introduced in highly improbable ways resulting in a myriad of more or less standalone stories feeling far more self-contained than they had any right to be. It felt unbelievable, especially for a mystery show.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 6\\n\\n\r\nI gave Sakurako-san a 6 because it had wonderfully unique main characters, a flashy, vibrant aesthetic, and a handful of interesting-enough short mystery stories that kept my attention. It fell short of higher scores because of its failed attempt to create something more substantial and its lackluster supporting cast along with its needlessly self-contained narrative progression. Ultimately it was more fun watching Sakurao with her brash interactions and childish enthusiasm than anything else.\\n\\n\r\n[Recommendations]:\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend Sakurako-san to anyone interested in a decent mystery show with a fun heroine character though I would warn that it is the kind that reveals the details of its mysteries by means of its characters rather than allowing them to be picked up on by its viewers and pieced together beforehand, foreshadowing aside.",

            "content": "I don't know about you, but the whole \"mundane, reactionary dude and a sociopathic genius with a knack for solving mysteries \" set up has been rubbing me off as of late. I already had the atrocious \"Ranpo Kitan\" sear itself into my memory just weeks before Beautiful Bones: Sakurako's Investigation began, so realistically speaking (even with the cliche premise I described) the show could not be any worse. I sure as hell was right, but not by anywhere near as far a margin I would have liked. \r\nThe mood Beautiful Bones goes for is a pretty strange blend between the macabre and the mundanevarying one weekly episodic endeavour to another. To give you an idea, the script goes from murder mysteries to something as innocuous as finding out the final wishes of a dead grandmother. This is not really a problem to me in theory since it isn't uncommon for episodic titles to jump back, forth and sideways between tones, nor should it be discouraged. Bluntly put, it's just that the mysteries are either boring, badly written or both. Right off the bat the series asks for a high degree of suspension of disbelief when Sakurako arrives at a crime scene with human remains and is allowed to push around and belittle the police their despite the fact she lacks the credentials to even be at a crime scene to begin with, and it only gets worse from there. To further illustrate my problems with how mysteries are dealt with in Beautiful Bones, allow me to draw your attention to another episodic title starring a genius investigator, Master Keaton. It's a series where you could reasonably make a case for the main character being a \"Mary Sue\" in how his deductions are never wrong and the way in which he can competently handle all kinds of dangerous situations, but the reason why Master Keaton can get away with it is because the writers restrict Keaton's intellect to his broad areas of expertise as a human civilizations buff and a former British SAS soldier. That way you can, at least, buy that he would know how to do everything from identifying obscure pieces of jewelry to disarming criminals at close quarters. Sakurako, on the other hand, spends her entire life studying bones as an osteologist yet is sometimes able to draw random factoids convenient to the situation at hand. One moment she can be an expert on knot-tying, the next, a 19th-century paint aficionado. The emotional impact the show tries to go for with some of these stories is always hampered for one reason or another, whether it be the realization of how the characters bring misfortune due to their own stupidity, the pacing being rushed, or the mysteries themselves being just too low in stakes to care about (without good characters driving them) the show always found a way to leave me cold.\\n\\n\r\nIf you watch Beautiful Bones for the character interactions, you may find yourself as disappointed as one looking for well-written mysteries. The only characters in the show worth wasting digital ink on are Sakurako and her sidekick Shoutarou. I already went into how Sakurako's Sakurako-isms are bad for the mysteries, but the character herself went someone I originally found to be mildly amusing to watch at 1st to one I found rather unlikeable by the end. There's a difference between being unsentimental and being outright cruel to people, and I was hoping that through her adventures with her social norm abiding sidekick she would come to find that line. Instead by the penultimate episode, Sakurako is still the type of person who would wave around bits of newly discovered human remains around the people that cared about the deceased. There's also some subplot regarding Sakurako's history with a dead younger brother which is continually hinted at, yet never gets any closure by the end, so much for that I guess. No better a character is her boring accessory Shoutarou, whose main role in the story is to be the voice of proper social etiquette to counterbalance Sakurako's wackiness (sort of like a straight man of a comedic duo but applied  to a mystery anime). It wasn't enough for him to be a boring archetype, however, he also gets to be a part of annoying and cliche drama. Such as the time where he cries over how Sakurako doesn't show the same level of sentimental attachment to the bones of long dead cats (which shouldn't be a surprise considering not even seeing dead bodies phases her at all). The drama usually ends with Sakurako turning out to be a bit more kind-hearted than normal before ending the episode on a happy note before starting it all over again later. The formulaic drama didn't make me like either of them more as characters so much as it accentuated just how little the two seem to learn from each other. The final episodes put up one last-ditch effort to convince me of their friendship, yet failed since the two of them as individuals aren't particularly likeable, and the fact that it became clear that the main hanging plot thread (Sakurako's quest to stop a pretentious serial killer who collects sphenoids for some reason, aptly named \"the Sphenoider\") was left as bait for a 2nd season I don't care to ever see come into existence.\\n\\n\r\nThe worst thing I really have to say about Beautiful Bones, however, is that there is no reason to remember it now that it's done airing (asides from the fantastic background art). It's not utterly terrible like Ranpo Kitan, but it never showed enough promise to even be a memorable disappointment",

Ep 4 and 5. about the attempted suicide of Takeshi Fujioka...why would would he fake an attack and making it look like a suicide by cutting himself in his leg , was just too lame even by \"B\" movie standards, also gradma who fell from her dead in ep 3, they could have chosen a good timing to found the bones, now logically speaking if someone is missing wouldn't granddaughter Yuriko Kougami be reporting as a missing person, wouldn't the cop be on location of the dead granny in the soonest possible time? So it was safe to say that the scenarios and the plot wasn't about the mystery rather it was a dark adventure and indirect romance of Sakurako the cougar and Shoutaru the tadpole. Cu'z IMO this is what original creator Ota, Shiori was focusing, which IMO is \"fair\"enough.   \\n\\n\r\nArt (up)\\n\\n\r\nThere isn't any moe in it in fact Sakurako attire were either tomboyish with her white shirt and black slacks attire or classy in her feminine attire, which is IMO deserves a \"Very Good\" for art director Itou Akira, since there isn't any fanservice or any bikini scene here, and it's a \"Very Good\" thing that this anime didn't rely on the those things to sell, just her back scene from the ending theme, it's a big sorry for them perves cu'z they won't be able to make love with Sakurako in their dreams.\\n\\n\r\nSound (up)\\n\\n\r\nWell it's good that the seiyuu who did Sakurako's voice matched the character and the opening theme match the anime as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (up)\\n\\n\r\nOk, so Sakurako was great and she one lady who has both brains and guts, but that's just the thing.....she was overmade, how can a  Osteologist be a forensic psychologist, chemist, archaeologist and all that CSI she bang, be that good when she's only in her twenties.  Shoutarou was also being overmade as well like how can a shorty like him take down a junkie from ep.2 where, even with the knowledge of jujitsu in his bodyframe he would have a very hard time to take-on a junkie who is chemically imbalance where in reality would take at least 2 guys to subdue such guy. IMO, original creator Ota, Shiori didn't properly utilize the proper casting and the right action for the job, in ep.2 it should have been Utsumi who should be taking down the junkie not Shoutarou, if it were me, I would have had Utsumi to try to subdue a junkie despite of getting  stabbed and Shoutarou should have help him by knocking the Junkie's leg with a 2x4 wood. In ep 4 and 5, it should not be Utsumi who should be casted with with the two , rather it should have been Itsuki who should have be there as the cast, in ep 10 and 11 , it should have been Utsumi who should be casted there with the two and not Itsuki, so basically the choice of cast with the two ( Sakurako and Shonen) for each episode was just \"Poor\" that in every episode plot make the support characters ill-fit for it. And let's not for the Sakurako's fiance...where is he, his absence alone really makes this anime focus on a cougar and tadpole relationship. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (up)\\n\\n\r\nBasically my enjoyment was simply with the cougar and tadpole, and that's as far as I go, in fact I'm very much disgusted with this anime's supposed crime drama .\\n\\n\r\nOverall (up) \\n\\n\r\nMy advice, don't focus on the mismatch crime solving and just focus on  the cougar and tadpole mystery romance, so overall it's a decent anime.\\n\\n\r\nPeace and Happy upcoming 2016.",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nThe closest I have ever been to death is a moment that I don\u2019t even remember.\r\nComplications during childbirth are common. For me, at the (very) tender age of ten seconds old, there were two such complications: the umbilical cord and my size. The cord just so happened to wrap itself around my throat, cutting off oxygen to my body. As for my size, I was so huge (ten pounds, eight ounces) that I got stuck in the birthing canal.\r\nThe doctors, desperate to save both my mom and me, made the decision to add a thirdcomplication: bone breakage. To get me out in the world, they snapped my collar bone, stopping death and granting life. They got the umbilical cord situation sorted out, too, but, by that point, I looked like a massive, blue mess.\\n\\n\r\nFor me, bones technically mean everything. For Sakurako of Sakurako-san no Ashimoto ni wa Shitai ga Umatteiru, bones literally mean everything. As for the anime itself, well, it has a few broken bones of its own.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nSakurako-san slates itself as a mystery anime. To this end, it decides on the episodic approach. The season consists of multiple mini-arcs with no arc lasting longer than two episodes. One arc involves a lost child. Another focuses on a lover\u2019s decision. Another still deals with three previous best friends.\\n\\n\r\nAlmost every episode has one trait in common: bones. Be it a skull found at the beach or some skeletal remains found at the foot of a hill, bones are often within reach. They make up the mystery part of the anime; they cause the audience to question how those bones came to be.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cQuestion\u201d is a bit lenient, however, because the audience never really gets to surmise or figure out the circumstances behind the bones. I.e., Sakurako does most of the work. This in turn makes the mystery part of the anime a moot point. Which is weird. If the mystery does not matter, then what is the point of the anime?\\n\\n\r\nThe answer derives from both the episodic format and the bones: life and death. Sakurako alludes to this idea in the last episode when she talks about cherry-blossom trees (and, indirectly, the title of the anime.)\\n\\n\r\nThe bones that Sakurako and Shoutarou find each tell a story. A story that, despite the bones being bleached with age or preserved in a box, still exists. Stories that are touching, emotional. They demonstrate what makes people human. Stories about a mother that loves her daughter and baby, the difficulty of moving on with one\u2019s life, and relationships borne of mutual troubles.\\n\\n\r\nAnd as Sakurako further talks about, time does not stop. While the bones are fragments of the past, the present still has the people connected to those bones. Those people have memories. They have feelings. They have a connection that neither bones nor time can stifle come the future. So, in Sakurako-san\u2019s vision, it\u2019s best to live. To create those memories and share those feelings. In other words, death comes, but life comes first.\\n\\n\r\nThematically, the anime does well. On a writing level, however, it gets shaky. The episodic format does not entice the anime to have a prevalent, overarching narrative. An underlying thread exists in the form of Hanabusa, the mastermind behind many of the killings, but his name and his importance are very rarely referenced. Arguably, though, since he remains unimportant to the majority of the anime, his lack of presence is likewise unimportant.\\n\\n\r\nThe episodic format also prevents the audience from properly resonating with the stories told. Quickly going from one person\u2019s dilemma and tale to the next without letting the message sink in hampers the impact. Worse still, many of the messages are spilled out amidst the explanation of the mystery and, consequently, as large expository asides that are difficult to digest.\\n\\n\r\nGoing back to the mysteries themselves, the presentation of each one also treads into repetitive territory. The boy and woman show up, find some bones, and, after finding a few clues, Sakurako solves the case. The argument that the repetition correlates to the repetitive nature of life and death comes off as more of an excuse rather than a purposeful decision.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the narrative contains stories that, while not individually sound, collectively advocate the importance of life, the importance of death, and the messages that can be gleaned between them.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nOne of Sakurako-san\u2019s strongest facets is its art.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the cinematography is nothing special, consisting of standard shots, the backgrounds more than make up for any stagnancy in perspective. Various locations from dense forests to bustling festivals are visited. Sakurako\u2019s study, the living room of the man with the weak heart, and Yumiko\u2019s side room demonstrate the large amount of detail that goes into each location. And the lighting goes into overdrive, basking the different areas in sunlight, moonlight, and streetlamps.\\n\\n\r\nSakurako\u2019s specialized sequence, where a bountiful bunch of bones begin to walk about her as though they were alive, was a neat effect. Unfortunately, the anime rarely uses the sequence beyond the first quarter of the anime, making one wonder where it went and wanting to see more of it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter designs are a small step down from the art. In general, they are quite plain, the characters lacking specific qualities that make their looks interesting. Shoutarou\u2019s beige hair, the teacher\u2019s suit, and the police officer\u2019s work uniform are fitting but not exactly stunning. In fairness, the anime depicts realistic situations and people, so having realistic-looking characters makes sense.\\n\\n\r\nSakurako\u2019s design, however, deserves more attention. Her look is that of a classic beauty \u2013 long, dark hair, an ample figure, and an attractive face with striking eyes and a beauty spot for extra allure. Designing her as beautiful rather than ugly when Sakurako\u2019s character revolves around death speaks volumes on how the anime views death. Her regular outfit also needs to be mentioned. She wears a white top with black pants, a famous dichotomy on the color spectrum. Here, it symbolizes the main theme of the anime: life and death.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the actual animation, it remains relatively high. The laidback nature of the anime \u2013 no action-heavy scenes or the like \u2013 allows the cast to move with clarity. Hair and limb movements, as well as facial expressions and eye shifts, persist throughout the show, breathing life into an otherwise lifeless anime.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nTechnically speaking, Sakurako-san has a lot of characters. But, technically speaking, the vast majority of them are largely unimportant.\\n\\n\r\nTheir importance goes down due to the episodic format. Much of the cast has no presence between the different arcs \u2013 mostly because the people related to the bones are not the main or supporting characters.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, this statement is not true for every character. The cop takes part in some episodes. So does the teacher. And Yumiko, Shoutarou\u2019s classmate, is literally a relative of the deceased in her story. But even these characters are not all that important. They exist as vehicles for the messages being told in their respective stories. To put it differently, they do not develop as characters per se, but they do allow the audience to understand the importance of the story being told.\\n\\n\r\nSimilar to the narrative, then, who are the important characters of Sakurako-san? This question is a lot easier to answer compared to before: Shoutarou and Sakurako.\\n\\n\r\nStarting with Shoutarou, he is a high-school student who has recently taken some interest in bones. Said interest comes from his interest in Sakurako. While it is implied that he has feelings or, at the minimum, a crush on the beautiful lady, he began to hang out with her as a means to escape a life that he found boring.\\n\\n\r\nOver the course of the season, the audience comes to learn more about Shoutarou. He has training in martial arts. He seems to only think about food. He had a grandmother that cared deeply for him \u2013 more so than he ever knew.\\n\\n\r\nShelving Shoutarou for the moment, Sakurako could not be more different than him. As an osteologist, her life\u2019s work demands the study of bones. But it is more than just studying them: Sakurako loves bones more than she loves life itself. Thanks to her skeletal-spying, teeth-inspecting, and knowledge-having ways, she leads the charge in every mystery, revealing the truth of the bones before her.\\n\\n\r\nLike Shoutarou, more about her person is made known over the course of the season. She has a mean sweet tooth, especially when it comes to cakes and puddings. She has a fianc\u00e9 whose sole purpose (since he is never actually shown) is to deter Shoutarou from pursuing his feelings (and angering the audience, too). Most important of all is her hatred of death, a byproduct of a traumatizing event from her past.\\n\\n\r\nGetting back to the technical speaking, Shoutarou and Sakurako do not develop as characters. At least, not to a substantial extent. Sakurako overcomes her fear of death by accepting Shoutarou, and Shoutarou overcomes the stagnant river of life by chasing after Sakurako. But these developments of theirs occur in the final episode. They are a culmination of the events, but a singular moment is not a large amount of change for the two.\\n\\n\r\nOn an individual basis, their characters continue to prove how mishandled they are. For Shoutarou, the anime rarely shows how he came to find life so boring, what made him believe that his current course could be different. For Sakurako, that traumatizing event about her younger brother Soutarou never has a solid foundation. The event is barely referenced on occasion, but the actual moment is not shown. For an anime that emphasizes the past so much, it is surprising how little it cares about the pasts of its two main characters.\\n\\n\r\nWhere Shoutarou and Sakurako shine best is on a group basis.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the discussions on their characters above, a certain pattern arises. Shoutarou is about life. He questions the life he leads. He regularly thinks positively about life. He loves life\u2019s people, emotions, and opportunities. In contrast, Sakurako is about death. She fixates on death\u2019s aftermath. She hates death itself. She defines herself as one truly traumatized by death.\\n\\n\r\nShoutarou represents life. Sakurako represents death. Combined, they represent a beautiful and philosophical sentiment: life and death are inseparable. Just as Shoutarou chases after Sakurako, life (inevitably) chases after death. And just as Sakurako embraces Shoutarou, death (inevitably) embraces life. Shoutarou and Sakurako are a team in the same way that life and death (or death and life, depending on one\u2019s outlook) happen to be.\\n\\n\r\nOne could even argue how the faux romantic separation between Shoutarou and Sakurako symbolizes the separation between life and death \u2013 they are a coupling but two entities that can never realistically be together. A slight stretch, but it\u2019s fun to think about.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless, Shoutarou and Sakurako mean a lot to each other even if they do not mean much on their own. And given that their shared theme of life and death is similarly shared with the narrative\u2019s theme, they have more strength as characters than originally perceived.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nEasily the strongest part of the music is the ending track. Taking on more of a chilling tone, the vocalist accompanies a small number of instruments, letting her do most of the work. During the first half, the OP is nuanced and atmospheric. It\u2019s not until the second half that the piece picks up, a more pronounced beat and lengthier lyrical sections taking shape.\\n\\n\r\nIn a way, the ED mirrors the mystery cases Sakurako solves: They start off weird and unknown, and they end with a defined conclusion. The whole track is ghostly, strange, and melancholic, standing as a wonderful addition to Sakurako-san.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening track goes down a different route. Piano dominates much of the piece with a drum beat and some nice vocal work from the singer. Compared to the ED, the OP is happier, optimistic in tone. And this direction makes sense \u2013 having a happy OP and a sad ED matches the life and death motif that permeates the rest of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem with the OP, however, is the presentation. Where the ED sounds nuanced and foreboding, the OP sounds as though a lot of noises were mashed together. So while the piece has power in the context of the show, the piece lacks appeal outside of it.\\n\\n\r\nThen there is the rest of the original soundtrack. Sakurako\u2019s investigative tracks, called (coincidentally enough) \u201cSakurako\u2019s Investigation\u201d and \u201cAn Answer to the Puzzle,\u201d are the highlights. Their back-and-forth tune and triumphant composition work in tandem to form a track that follows the mystery-to-solved progress of the cases, much like the ED does.\\n\\n\r\nThe large number of the tracks, however, are more atmospheric in nature. These tracks are usually one of two tones: slice-of-life like \u201cInnocent Honesty\u201d or sad like \u201cSuper Regret.\u201d Sticking mostly to these two tones follows along with the consistent life-and-death motif that Sakrurako-san has been shown to use. These tracks are not particularly impressive, but they are fitting for the anime nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nVoice-acting performances are neither amazing nor awful; they are okay for what had been provided. Shizuka Itou as Sakurako uses a mature and slightly arrogant voice that fits the beautiful woman. Junya Enoki, in one of his first major roles, as Shoutarou uses a younger voice for the so-called boy. And while Sakurako has moments of emotion \u2013 most often when she remembers Soutarou through Shoutarou \u2013 and Shoutarou can get stern with Sakurako, the scenes do not demand much out of the characters, so they never have the chance to shine.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nAs a romance buff, it was certainly disappointing to see the anime refuse to pursue the romantic pairing between Shoutarou and Sakurako. That kind of relationship \u2013 an older woman being with a younger man \u2013 is rarely seen in anime, so when it seems like it should obviously exist and it doesn\u2019t, the whole situation becomes infuriating.\\n\\n\r\nIt also does not help that Sakurako seems to show zero romantic interest in Shoutarou, quelling those thoughts anyway. And combined with the anime not pursuing the other romantic pairing of Shoutarou and Yumiko, the lack of romance made me mad to see.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Sakurako, I cannot say that I liked her all that much. She\u2019s certainly attractive in looks and she can be cute when she wants to, but, in personality, she was a turn-off. Very rude, very insensitive.\\n\\n\r\nDespite my anger at the lack of romance and my dislike of Sakurako\u2019s personality, I liked the banter between her and Shoutarou. Shoutarou acting like a parent and Sakurako acting like a child made for some funny scenes, like when Sakurako tried to steal that skull or when Shoutarou used the information center to locate his \u201clost child.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters are ones I did not care for much. Shoutarou is overly plain. The buddy cop seems like a nice dude, but, following the halfway mark of the season, he never shows up again. The teacher is similar. Yumiko, despite acting as the rebound romantic interest, is actually annoying. She is a fun character to have on screen \u2013 cute, confident, and caring \u2013 but she is a bit too much of a goody-two-shoes.\\n\\n\r\nMy favorite tales from the season were Yumiko\u2019s grandmother\u2019s painting, Shoutarou\u2019s grandmother\u2019s pudding, and the mother protecting her children. I love my family to bits, so hearing about how much thought the grandmothers put into their respective actions for their grandchildren was something I understood from my own grandmother. As for that third tale, Ii-chan was a cute kid that made the gloomy anime slightly brighter.\\n\\n\r\nThe other tales were fine but not really to my liking. It was a combination of the characters involved and the tales being told. The \u201ccursed\u201d man, the three best friends, and the cat and caretaker just didn\u2019t have the same oomph as everything else.\\n\\n\r\nSakurako-san no Ashimoto ni wa Shitai ga Umatteiru encounters both life and death. Some strong themes laced with mediocre writing. Some nice art and music filled with weaknesses. And some interesting tales while others not-so-much. The anime\u2019s like a broken collar bone: technically worthwhile in some ways but literally problematic in others.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, a nice theme on life and death, supported by shoddy, singular tales\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Good, nice art, okay character designs, and above-average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, Shoutarou and Sakurako\u2019s duality of life and death holds strength even if their individual characters do not\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, okay OP, good ED, okay OST, okay VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Bad, tiptoeing around the romance, an unlikable cast, and only a handful of the tales were interesting\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 5/10",

            "content": "You know what my big problem with light novel adaptations are? They never have a good story. Okay there's one or two exceptions, but for the most part, when their plots aren't being dumb, they're just non-existent in general. It's always world-building or character-building for its own sake, which is basically showcasing the finest bullets in the world without a gun to actually fire them with. Impressive-looking bullets my friend, but unless you're planning to make the bad guys swallow the damn things, I don't see how they're going to help us here.\r\nWell, impressive may be giving most light novel adaptations too much credit becausethey generally look like ass on top of their other problems. But to be fair to Beautiful Bones, it does look nice for the most part - even if said niceness is often undercut with choppy direction and awful usage of filters. If this is going to be the norm for all of Studio Troyca's output, then you can add them to the list of fledgling studios that failed to make it big, because it's not a good look. I guess we'll see what happens in their future stuff, but for now, let's focus on Beautiful Bones. From what I remember, there were a bunch of people who were excited about this because it had the mystery label on it, along with word that it looked like Hyouka except not boring. Word of advice my friends. No matter how bad a KyoAni show is, any anime where the phrase \"it looks like this KyoAni show except actually good\" can be applied to it will always turn out bad. No exception.\\n\\n\r\nAnd Beautiful Bones is pretty damn bad. It's not just the direction that's choppy, but the storytelling is mismanaged as well. For starters, just like the other Fall mystery show, it begins in medias res so it pretty much assumes you already know who our main duo is and thus we're supposed to find it cute when Sakurako guzzles over bones and solves mysteries with a Deus Ex Machina power because that's who she is. And also like that other Fall mystery show, the characters have no personal stakes in regards to any of the cases besides revealing token bits about Sakurako's past, which I'll get to later, so I'm not really sure why I'm supposed to care about them or the mysteries they're involved in.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not sure if Beautiful Bones is worse than The Perfect Insider, but it's definitely not as fun to take the piss on. They both take their premises seriously whilst being horribly paced and completely lacking in tension, but whilst Perfect Insider couldn't stop banging on about how intelligent it is despite not realizing it was playing with a firework that had been soaked in sewer water, Beautiful Bones is sort of comfortable in its own inanity and proceeds to just go about its life like it's nobody's business, wallowing in mediocrity rather than striving to be anything more. There are multiple episode where there's not even a case happening, instead taking time to focus on the characters just going on about their lives despite the fact that I have no reason to care about seeing their lives. And when a case does happen, it's always clumsily executed due to the police being legendarily thick and the motivations being as sensical as Michael Jackson's singing.\\n\\n\r\nNot that Sakurako's or her boy toy's motivations are any better. Beautiful Bones tries to sell us on their relationship as the glue that holds everything together, completely unaware that it's the cheap kind you'd use in elementary school because it's completely lacking. A good relationship-driven show is supposed to have the characters complement each other in a way that drives the story, but Beautiful Bones can't even get as far as to do the complementing in the first place since Shotaro is mostly there to act in awe of Sakurako's skills whilst being her morality pet and personal joke-punching bag whilst Sakurako...just goes on about life as always except now she has a kid hanging around her. Actually, I don't recall what the two do either together or separately other than hang out and solve mysteries. I understand it's supposed to be some Holmes/Watson thing, but Watson had a story. He was an army doctor who just got back from Afghanistan and needed to settle down. We never learn about what Shotaro's deal is until the final episode that details how he and Sakurako first met, and without spoiling anything, let's just say I don't see him going into any war zones soon.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Sakurako herself, the show builds up a story regarding her past and some villain that's manipulating all the cases around her to the point of ridiculousness, because my suspension of disbelief doesn't go so far as to accept that one man can manipulate both the case about a trapped child under a floorboard and the one about a cursed painting considering how little they have to with each other. And all it really tells us is that Sakurako is fragile on the inside. Wow. Great characterization there, Holmes. Not that that's automatically a bad story, but in addition to all the crap surrounding it, when I see buildup happening throughout the course of a show, I expect there to be some fucking payoff! And that's another problem with light novel adaptations by the way: they never end. It's like in order to get your series approved, you have to aim to be some Tolkien epic despite the fact that you don't have nearly the same amount of world-building skills that he did and you never will because you're working in an industry where all talent is to be left at the door when you enter the publisher's office. I'm pretty sure it even spells that fact out in the contract you have to sign with those guys.\\n\\n\r\nSo between a mismanaged cast, shoddy direction, tension-less mysteries, tension-less non-mysteries, and an ending sequence where you leer at Sakurako's naked body for some reason, at the end of the day, the show is basically like an un-sharpened #2 pencil: completely pointless.",

            "content": "The first impression of Sakurako-san is that it gives off the feeling of a show that is purely focused on the mystery genre. In that respect, it reminds many people of how Hyouka was, minus the school life part of it. And yet, comparing Sakurako-san to Hyouka doesn't really do either of the shows justice. Hyouka integrates daily life into its mystery aspects, while one of the main plot points for Sakurako-san is the separation between everyday life and the mystery of the dead.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThe episodic format of Sakurako-san does throw some people off a bit. The uneven pacing between each of the episodes isinfluenced by the fact that each episode focuses on a different case and a different body, with the exception of the three two-episode cases. Some of the cases are chilling, incorporating aspects of the thriller genre in the fairly linear formula of \"character introduction, present problem, gather evidence, formulate conclusion,\" such as the case of The Cursed Man. Some of the cases are drama-filled, detailing the extreme measures that some people are willing to go to for a cause, whether it be life or love, exploring the delicate psyche that is molded and broken in certain people, such as the case of The Butterfly Vanished in November. And then again, some of the cases are genuinely heartfelt and evokes the emotion of sadness and perhaps even nostalgia, as the show tries to connect with its viewers deeper than a superficial and tension-filled setting, and tries to delve deeper into the viewers' psyche by bringing up the true mortality of life and how death comes with the passage of time, no matter the memories or emotions that may be associated with it. An example of this type would be Grandmother's Pudding. And I totally agree that, even though the show is episodic in nature, the discrepancies in pacing does hinder the show's progression, such as the transition of a thrilling episode 5 to an episode 6 that just mostly focuses on character development and focus. While the episodes themselves are brilliantly written and manages to evoke the exact emotions and tension that the director probably wanted, the discrepancies in pacing prevents this category from being a solid 10.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nHonestly, Sakurako-san suffered no graphical or animation hindrances from what I could tell. Maybe that's because I don't have the sharpest eyes for every little detail within a single scene, but I truly believe that the backgrounds and the character designs are extremely competent. I love it when Sakurako's eyes widen or narrow to express her mostly-logical mind's slight emotional outbursts, or how Ume's (the housekeeper) seems so kindly and warm and animated with all of that grandmother-like goodness. Nothing extraordinary done by studio TROYCA with their first time as a lead animation studio, but the visuals were solid nonetheless. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nIf there was background music to this show, it must've been quite minimalistic and non-intrusive since I didn't notice much music within the episodes or during dialogue to really perk my interest. That being said, what background sounds there were, such as a busy cafe or cars going by on a snowy street, sounded well-done and fitting for their roles. The voice actors were quite good, and I especially liked Shizuka Itou's voice for Sakurako, the way her voice drifts up and down to reflect her analyzing personality, and yet having certain raw emotional outbursts at bringing up truly traumatic happenings. As with most animes, an emphasis was placed on the opening theme rather than the closing, and TRUE does a wonderful little pop ballad with electronic influences for \"Dear answer.\" TECHNOBOYS was a little forgettable with the ending, however, and the fact that some episodes went over the ending theme to continue the story didn't help the song to brand itself into my memory either.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\r\nIf this was a normal show with a connected plotline, this score would definitely be lower. However, Sakurako-san runs into the trouble of having already developed characters placed into a world where the norm prevails, and the only anomalies happen to be the dead. This does not prevent Sakurako-san from filling its episodes with interesting and inventive characters, however, such as the cute and caring Yuriko Kougami to the almost nihilistic Itsuki Isokazi. It is unfortunate that Hanabusa, the \"main\" antagonist, wasn't explored almost at all, and was merely defined by the actions of his pawns throughout the episodes. It is exciting, however, to see how a person's psyche can bend and break under certain conditions, such as how Minami was twisted and turned by a contorted form of love, and how Shoutarou finally realizes how his grandmother still cared for him during his last days, giving him a new understanding of what is meant in her actions and her love. Through the episodes, however, the main characters, Sakurako and Shoutarou, fall flat, as Sakurako is continuously haunted by her little brother and maintains an almost sociopathic attitude towards life, while Shoutarou wanders around like a lost dog, behaving in mostly normal ways except for that fact that his actions give off a sense of naive love towards Sakurako. Some aspects of the characters are confusing, like how Hitoe's mind finally broke and how does Shoutarou actually feels towards his archetypal \"older sister.\" Nevertheless, the characters are still well done, even with flaws, firmly being granted a 7.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nWhile I have stated that character development isn't as huge an issue in episodic shows, the combination of slightly flat protagonists and an uneven pacing between even episodic plot structures leaves a man (or woman) wanting more out of this show. On top of that, the show leaves off on a cliffhanger, which is an absolutely horrible note in my book if the show has not been greenlit for a second season. That means that anime watchers may never truly know the fate of Hanabusa and whether this story is meant to be fatalistic, or optimistic in its views on death, life, and mortality itself.\\n\\n\r\n\"Read the manga!\" \"Read the light novel!\" You'll be reading the bottom of my foot after I kick you out of sheer annoyance.",

            "content": "\u201cBeautiful Bones\u201d or \u201cA Corpse is Buried Under Sakurako\u2019s Feet\u201d is a detective show styled directly upon the classic Sherlock Holmes novels, or at the very least, uses the general setup of Holmes to tell various stories about human mortality, and the various philosophical and moral issues that lie therein.\r\nThe character archetypes should be familiar. Sakurako-san is an eccentric, antisocial rich lady who spends her time studying bones because it is her passion. She is very intelligent, but often comes across as rude because of her honest and analytical nature. Shoutarou, presented as our protagonist, is the foil- a quiet, observative, and domestic high schoolboy who makes up for his lack of studied intelligence with warm kindness and keen eyes. A typical Sherlock and Watson, though Shoutarou is arguably a more competent character than Watson could ever hope to be.\\n\\n\r\nThe visual design is absolutely exactly what it needs to be- dull and uninteresting. No sarcasm here. This is a story that follows Sakurako and Shoutarou as they solve the fairly unpleasant mysteries of human remains they find in their daily lives. Each specific \u201ccase\u201d allows the callous Sakurako and the sentimental Shoutarou to give their opinions and analyses of the causes and morality behind each incident, making for a calm psychological drama/slice of life.\\n\\n\r\nThe appeal in this show is not action, or romance, or substantial drama. It is in the conversations between the characters, and the solving of the mysteries. It often tries to debunk or explain the \u201csupernatural\u201d in order to reveal some truth in the world, and most of it seems factually accurate. A large majority of the mysteries are completely solvable by anyone with the exact specialized knowledge or the observation skills required of analyzing human remains.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is hardly melodramatic, and does not rely on misunderstandings or arguments to carry the plot, and I appreciate the attempt to create an atmosphere of realistic morbid curiosity and investigation. While Sakurako and Shoutarou are extreme characters that likely do not exist in reality, they both have hyperbolized traits that exemplify real human urges. Sakurako represents an innate desire to unearth and understand facts, while Shoutarou seeks sentimental and spiritual peace in order to be morally comfortable with each case.\\n\\n\r\nWith simple visual design, excellent writing, great performances by all the voice actors, and an\u2026 entirely passable musical score, this anime is worth the time of anyone who is willing to sit down and come to terms with death in the context of human society. It, while facetious and pretentious at times, still manages to give realistic and mundane stories that pique a viewer\u2019s interest while also fundamentally remaining in reality. 7.5/10.\\n\\n\r\nNote: People seem to be unfairly disliking this show just because it is episodic. Why does being episodic lower the quality of the show? This is not some drama that is trying to tell a larger story than what is seen in each episode. The concept behind it is to suggest philosophy and opinion behind mortality in modern society, with a fictionalized but realistic setting. It does not need to have a sprawling, grand, \"Oh my god it's all connected!!!\" Part 4 JoJo ending to be a good murder mystery, because it is not trying to be a murder mystery.\\n",

            "content": "So the premise of the show is that it is a mystery and that Sakurako is an osteologist and thus knows a lot about bones and can tell the gender, animal and traumas from it, but the biggest problem with the stories/crime solving is that she magically becomes sherlock holmes at whim. She's suddenly knowledgeable in art. She's suddenly knowledgeable in jewellery. She's suddenly knowledgeable in knot tying. When you never present your character as being a very diversely knowledgeable person from the beginning (like Sherlock from Elementary), everything seems to be resolved by deus ex machina. \r\nNow the show is presented in a fairlyepisodic format. One episode generally has no relevance to its previous one besides character introduction, similar to Elementary. So what makes a mystery show great is that there are often lots of clues given out, some that are later proven to be wrong to the case or some that are proven crucial since the beginning. This show basically has none of that. How the mysteries are resolved is largely Sakurako showing up at the necessary place and everything is solved instantly, letting only the audience see it being told. There's no amazing in-depth explanation or analysis of things, it's really just: I'll show up, have a glance, and now the problem is solved. A little bit of techno-babble would have been great as well as letting the audience see into the life of an osteologist would have been ever better. But as it stands, it really feels like the author thought up an idea then decided to research it on wikipedia and eventually made the summary of it in his story.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a horrible way to present a show, let a lone a mystery. It's boring, it's basically skimped. Let's take a look at another show that does something like this, Mushishi. Now why is this show so much better than Sakurako? It's because there's actually some techno-babble in it along with some developed episodic characters. Most of the episodic characters in Sakurako don't have enough backstory and we're just given a simple exposition explaining their relevance then everything is resorted to melodrama and yelling.\\n\\n\r\nNext, since this is basically Sherlock Holmes, let's compare the two. Now Sherlock has a side-kick, Watson. And basically Shoutarou is Watson in this story. Except for a Watson, he is absolutely irritating and does nothing to contribute to solving the case; in fact it sometimes feels like he's hindering it. Hell, he's more like Watson and the police department mixed together since he ends up bringing the case to Sakurako. Shoutarou is probably one of the worst characters I have seen to date as he basically believes himself more mature than Sakurako but has the obtuseness of a male harem MC at understanding other people's emotions.\\n\\n\r\nSo how does the show feel overall? Well it's a mystery without the interesting mysteries. A dialogue heavy show with very superficial and unintriguing dialogue. The only redeeming thing I can find is the art, I find the character design okay, the background art ranges from industry standard to pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, yes there's some kind of story and it's told in between and kind of at the end of certain episodes (again, sort of like Elementary). Except we're basically left out of the actual story arc and you're either left to wait for season 2 or forced to read the novels.\\n\\n\r\nIn regards to deus ex machinas, Shoutarou is a black belt in whatever style for a single episode so solve that one exclusive case and then it's never heard from again.",

            "content": "*This is my first review.\r\nIn this review, I will go through each core element and give my thoughts as to why you should consider watching this anime. Before I get to that, I would like to say that I describe this anime as \"A crime drama with a lot less unnecessary drama, leading to a more interesting show\". If you happen to find yourself liking shows pertaining to crime, and are intrigued by things of the dead sort and their stories, this show is for you.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThe basic storyline of this anime is simple and very easy to follow. A girl who loves bones, alongwith her assistant solve puzzling mysteries together. It is from this main storyline that lots of interesting scenarios are created. The pacing is not too fast and not too slow; each story has their own episode, with some longer stories taking up to two episodes, which seems like a fair pace to me.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: 8/10 and 8/10\\n\r\nWhen watching an anime, I tend to pay no attention to the music or sound used because we want to focus on the story.Though I may not notice it, sound and art go hand in hand when creating atmosphere, which I think is done quite well in this anime. The art is not exactly to my style, but it was good nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed the different types of characters present in the story, due to their varying personalities, which makes for an interesting viewing. The number of characters in the anime are also just right- too little people make for a boring show; too many can make it confusing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall Impression: 9/10 & 9/10\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed this anime very much, and would highly recommend it to people who like these kinds of anime. Some things could have been done to make it even better, such as the inclusion of more episodes, which would increase the enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nTOTAL SCORE: ~8.67 (Rounded up to 9.0)",

In a rare and rewarding way, the script writers, voice actors, sound engineers, background artists, in-between animators and very noticeably the key frame animators and the researchers came together and created a coherent and beautiful show.\r\nI really can't praiseit enough, it balances tension with humor, pain and sorrow with truth and facts (Not made up facts either). It plays out like a novel written by someone who knows what they are doing, someone who understands human interaction, understands when foils are needed and when characters should just stand out by themselves.",

Most mysteries were complex and had a lot of suspense,. Another interesting fact was how the mysteries seemed to stretch from simple things like a lost gift to the tragic events such as the death of a mother. Also the atmosphere of the anime screamed out mystery.\r\nThere were some bad parts to the story as well. There are too many parallels to Sherlock Holmes novels, A mastermind(Moriarty in this, Hanabusa) manipulatingthe protagonist behind the scenes, being the root of most of the detectives cases .Also the cursed man seemed oddly familiar to the Hounds of the Baskervilles. Another problem is the unsatisfying ending, We got so much build up about hanabusa and then nothing after that but the ending wasn't that bad it showed how Sherlock... sorry I mean Sakurako and Shoutaru met. Finally we didn't much background Sakurako our protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nArt:9\\n\r\nThe show had a bright and expansive color palette, making the art sublime especially the cherry trees.\\n\r\nBut I do have a complaint, was the resemblance of the characters to the characters in Aldnoah.Zero.\\n\\n\r\nSound:6\\n\r\nThe opening was the only thing memorable for from the soundtrack and also the music from Sakurako's over the top \"lets solve the mystery \" scene. Except those none of the other track seemed significant \\n\\n\r\nCharacters :7\\n\r\nThe character development and the relationships between the characters are well established. As most main characters get some development throughout the series. Sakurako who can be initially seen as heartless is actually a much more caring character. Shoutaru on the other hand is your run of the mill kind person with a black belt. Yuri and her grandmothers relation is one of the standouts among the character interactions.\\n\r\nThen there are the flaws. Again the Sherlock parallels\\n\r\nSherlock Holmes-Sakurako, a sociopath who acts like they don't care for others, whilst they actually do, also both have an unhealthy obsession(many for Sherlock)\\n\r\nDr. Watson - Shoutaru, a normal person, who wants action in his life meets a detective who can help with that.\\n\r\n... and so on\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:8\\n\r\nAfter reading detective novels, watching multitudes of tv series and a couple of movies a detective anime is always enjoyable\\n\\n\r\nI wont drag this on any farther so this the end of the review\\n",

            "content": "Beautiful Bones: Sakurako's Investigation is quite an unusual anime as it focuses on a strange topic which are, as the title tells, bones. Beautiful Bones tells tiny stories about cases which most of them are related to bones of victims, and how a woman named Sakurako solves the case (well, sort of). Beautiful Bones had a lot of potential to be great. However with noticeable flaws, this anime falls back unfortunately. However it still manages to be enjoyable enough to be given a chance. \r\n~{Story}~\r\nThe premise of this anime is about a woman named Sakurako, who loves bones; studying them, organizing them, using them tosolve problems and collecting them. The \u201cstory\u201d revolves around Sakurako and a boy named Shoutarou, a high-schooler who assists Sakurako, solving cases by examining bones. The series showcases many different cases and the two puts them into fitting conclusions. Due to the episodic format of the series, there really isn\u2019t much of a main story in the series, until the series tries to create one near the end, only to have the series keeping it incomplete. Some of the cases in Beautiful Bones works, others do not. It really is a case of hit and miss here, which is a shame because if it could be more consistent with its content, this series could be so much more. The anime brings up a major case near the end of the anime, and the fact that it doesn\u2019t get completed shows a lack of organization for this anime. Not to mention that backstories for the two leads were pushed for the last episode. \\n\r\nStory: 5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Presentation}~\\n\r\nThe premise itself is very unique, focusing on a character\u2019s fondness on bones, shown through someone else\u2019s perspective. The style is very good for this anime, as it combines gorgeous, vivid art with bleak storylines, images and themes. The contrast of the two is what makes this anime\u2019s style work well. However the presentation feels lacking due to the series\u2019 inconsistent pacing. The anime will spend an episode worth of time of storylines that need more than that, while they\u2019ll give two episodes worth of time to storylines that deserve much less, or maybe none at all. Not to mention, some of the placement of some storylines felt weird, especially where the backstories of Sakurako and Shoutarou\u2019s was placed. Placing character development at the end of the series makes it completely pointless as you\u2019re done spending time with these characters. However, it can be noted that TROYCA might make a sequel series for this.\\n\r\nPresentation: 5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Character}~\\n\r\nI\u2019m not going to waste your time, Kujou Sakurako is a fantastic character, and she\u2019s one of the bigger reasons why this anime still manages to be good after all those flaws. Sakurako\u2019s fondness for bones is so entertaining, and her gaining a child\u2019s innocence whenever she\u2019s involved with bones are something that made me feel like she was a character with extreme depth. She\u2019s intellectual, pretty, mature for most of the time and insanely unique. Her fascination for bones and cases is what makes her special. Tatewaki Shoutarou is the opposite of Sakurako; he as an average perspective of everything, he\u2019s a typical high-school boy, and nowhere near as interesting as Sakurako. Shoutarou, for the most part, feels like a typical character and he\u2019s just there to be a contrast for Sakurako. There\u2019s nothing special about at all and all. The supporting cast is also pretty uninteresting. Kougami Yuriko, though pretty and nice, is there just for the sake of being there. There\u2019s no depth given to her. Isozaki Itsuki-sensei, though ends up being pretty interesting, was felt underutilized. Also character relationship between Shoutarou and Sakurako is lacking, as no backstory was given to them until the end. The only thing that happens between them is the contrast they make when they\u2019re together. It\u2019s mainly because Sakurako seems miles of a better character than Shoutarou, which ends up making their relation lacking. \\n\r\nCharacter: 5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Art}~, \\n\r\nTROYCA is a really new studio and the only other anime they made was Aldnoah.Zero, which was co-developed by A-1 Pictures, which makes Beautiful Bones their first solo project. If Beautiful Bones felt lacking with its quality, it would have been forgivable. However, the production values are outstanding. The art is some of the best of this year, and that was a complete surprise. The gorgeous, vivid art makes a wonderful contrast with its bleak content and images (such as bones). The backgrounds are superbly detailed. The insides of buildings are filled with tiny detailing that it feels obvious that TROYCA spent quite a lot of time on their art. Character models are pretty good. Sakurako by far looks the best, as her mature look makes her character a breath of fresh air. They did a good job at making Shoutarou look as typical as he can. The supporting cast however don\u2019t look any special, however, they\u2019re still good to look at.\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Animation}~\\n\r\nThe animations are also top-notch in Beautiful Bones, and it doesn\u2019t pull back the art. TROYCA seems like as if they are influenced by A-1 Pictures because their animation style feels similar to things A-1 Pictures has done before. Animation qualities are consistent and well done. However, since it\u2019s a mystery, there isn\u2019t really much that can test this anime\u2019s animation quality. However it does, whatever it has to do, very well. CG is used on moving, colorful animal skeletons, which appear whenever Sakurako starts a case. The CG is done well, and it\u2019s not that distracting. Facial animations and character movement is really good. One particular thing I like about the animations was that they animated tiny details in the background, which makes the production values much higher for this anime.\\n\r\nAnimation: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Voice Acting}~\\n\r\nItou Shizuka did a fantastic job as Sakurako. The maturity she puts into her character is outstanding. Itou Shizuka plays a big role in making Sakurako a unique and interesting character. Enoki Junya does a decent job as Shoutarou, considering Enoki is pretty new to the industry. He does a good job making the character sound as average as he can. Imamura Ayaka, who is also pretty new to the industry, does an okay job as Yuriko, it\u2019s nothing to special though. Ishida Akira does a great job as Itsuki-sensei, which is to be expected from a well-received experience seiyuu. He does a nice job giving the sensei a lighter tone when needed. Overall, the voice acting is impressive in Beautiful Bones.\\n\r\nVoice Acting: 6/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Music}~\\n\r\nLet me get this out of the way as fast as possible; the music in Beautiful Bones is spectacular. The OP, \u201cDear answer\u201d, is great as it\u2019s catchy and it\u2019s a nice showcase for Sakurako. However the ED, \u201cUchiyoserareta Boukyaku no Zankyou ni\u201d, is miles better, as it is one of he best ED I\u2019ve ever heard. It\u2019s mysterious, chilling and the vocals are just right. And the music for the ED is fantastic too. The background music used in Beautiful Bones is outstanding. The main theme used in the anime (which is also used in PV 1) is spectacular. There\u2019s so many different versions of the theme (\u201cA Corpse is Buried Under The Feet\u201d, \u201cBeautiful Bones\u201d, \u201cSolution of The Puzzle\u201d, \u201cSakurako's Investigation\u201d, and \u201cAn Answer To The Puzzle\u201d), and all of them are fantastic. Other pieces such as \u201cButterfly\u201d, \u201cAmbition\u201d, and many others, all help create a great mood for the anime. The mysterious tracks are by far the best of the series\u2019 collection.\\n\r\nMusic: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Enjoyment}~\\n\r\nSome cases do end up being enjoyable as some of them are quite well written, however some of the cases end up being unenjoyable due to some predictable writing and unsatisfying conclusions. The first case in the series is left incomplete, which is something that should have happened at all. Some of the character development were saved for the last and the anime itself is left incomplete. However Sakurako as a character is what makes this anime a lot more enjoyable as her character is a breath of fresh air. Also the fantastic art and outstanding music makes this anime a lot better than it is. \\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall Beautiful Bones: Sakurako's Investigation is a good mystery anime, not a great one. The cases presented in the anime is a hit or miss, the character development and relationships are bare bones, and the anime itself is left incomplete, making a sequel seasons a necessity for this series. However Sakurako manages to shine throughout the series due to her peculiar behavior. The top-notch production values and outstanding background music also help in making this anime worth watching. It\u2019s just a shame that it couldn\u2019t manage to get the most out of its premise as the anime only manages to be good, not great.\\n\\n\r\n+ Exceptional, gorgeous art that makes a nice contrast with its bleak premise.\\n\r\n+ Great OP, fantastic ED, and outstanding background music. \\n\r\n+ Sakurako is a great character, and Itou Shizuka does a great job doing the role.\\n\r\n+ Interesting premise, and some great suspenseful case.\\n\r\n- Some cases are misses and the story is left incompletely do to terrible pacing and storyline placement.\\n\r\n- Besides Sakurako, the rest of the cast of characters fail to be as interesting. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6.4/10",

            "content": "Shoutarou Tatewaki is tired of his everyday life. He goes and comes from school, and nothing changes. That is, until he meets Sakurako Kujou. Sakurako seems like a normal bishoujo, but she has an odd secret: she's obsessed with bones. Whenever Shoutarou is with Sakurako, he comes across bones, and life around Sakurako is never boring.\r\nSakurako is an interesting protagonist, to say the least. The reason this anime caught my eye in the first place is because of her unusual description as a \"bone-loving ojou-san.\" Her quirkiness never fails to interest me, although it certainly is unsettling at times. The mysteries that are presented inthis show, while often episodic, are intriguing and informative.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the format of the anime leaves much to be desired. Think about it, what makes a mystery anime/movie/book/etc so exciting is the suspense. You don't know what will happen or what has happened, and you have to analyze the clues yourself to find the answer. But thanks to the walking, talking asspull plot device known as Sakurako Kujou and her unlimited supply of knowledge, there is very little mystery in this \"mystery\" anime. We, the viewers, are seldom given the chance to think for ourselves; Sakurako just happens to know everything about everything, and while this means mysteries are solved quickly, viewers are left feeling unsatisfied.\\n\\n\r\nAnother huge issue in this show is the lack of character development from ANY of the main characters. Ironically, the character who receives the most development is Isozaki-sensei, a minor character who shows up in maybe four or five of the twelve episodes. While Shoutarou is adorable, he doesn't change at all over the course of the anime. And Sakurako's development is literally nonexistent. Tragically, she's the character who needs the most development. The first time she hears Shoutarou's name, she reacts in a pretty startling way. We learn that her reaction is because she had a younger brother named Soutarou who passed away. I'm still convinced that her brother's death is a big part of who she is, but we NEVER get even a hint of her backstory. Scenes throughout the anime hint that her brother's death affected her very deeply, yet we never learn more than the bare surface.\\n\\n\r\nIn episodes 4 & 5, we learn about an elusive villain who seems to play a big role in multiple mysteries throughout the series. Some scenes even suggest that Sakurako has encountered him before and is working to stop him. However, aside from the suspicious mentions of him in episodes 4 & 5 and then again in 11 & 12, nothing really happens. He's clearly a formidable opponent, yet we never see more of him. His introduction into the storyline seems pointless, since he never gets much screentime.\\n\\n\r\nI think a large issue with this anime was with pacing. Had this anime been a two-cour series, it could have spent more time with each case, possibly doing without Sakurako's endless well of knowledge and allowing the viewers to speculate on the mysteries. We honestly could have done without the filler episodes in the middle (looking at you, episodes 6-9), and the anime could have focused on the painter from episodes 4-5 and 11-12. That would have made a much better, more enthralling story. (Think Psycho Pass, but with more bones!) And that's the reason I'm so disappointed with this anime: It could have been SO MUCH MORE than it ended up being, and that's a tragedy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Sakurako-san no Ashimoto ni wa Shitai ga Umatteiru wasn't a bad watch. However, it fell far short of its potential; instead of being an okay anime, it could have been amazing. But due to bad pacing, bad plot progression, and severely underdeveloped characters, the execution of this anime came out...lukewarm. Mediocre. As is the case with almost all the mystery anime I've watched. The search continues.\\n\\n\r\nFinal score: 6/10 \\n\r\nDo I recommend it? Meh. Not if you want something spectacular, but the cases are interesting.",

Thank you.\r\nStory - 7\r\nI give the story category a 7 (good) because it was very well planned out for each episode. However, each episode has it's own story. The bigger picture of Sakurako and Shoutarou's relationship with each other, and the antagonist Hanafusa, were not touched on much until the very last episode. Each story that was unfolded, though, were not bad; it was not hard to stay interested in it.\r\nArt - 8\r\nI give theart category an 8 (very good) because the art style of this anime was absolutely beautiful. The color scheme used depended on the mood of the events. When it was emotional in a happy sense, it became amazingly colorful and vibrant. At times when it was upsetting, the colors became very dull and grey.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7\\n\r\nI give the sound category an 8 (very good) because it was good in quality, and contained exactly the right amount of sounds required to set the tone of the events. The voice actors chosen for the characters really fit the description and appearance of the characters themselves.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8 \\n\r\nI give the character category an 8 (very good) because the character development throughout the anime seemed to be done well. Not just the main characters- supporting characters, such as Yuriko Kougami, developed and grew throughout the series as well. The design of all the characters was absolutely beautiful- it fit their descriptions very well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9\\n\r\nI give the enjoyment category a 9 (great) purely based on how much I enjoyed the anime itself. I absolutely loved it- the idea that I got to watch adventures of an osterologist (regardless of how ridiculous those adventures' findings got at times) made me so excited- I was at the edge of my chair the entire time. When I wasn't, I was either tearing up at the emotional events, or I was laughing at the awkwardness between two characters.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum it up:\\n\r\nOverall - 8\\n\r\nI give Sakurako-san no Ashimoto ni wa Shitai ga Umatteiru an overall score of 8 (very good). The individual stories unfolded in a clean and clear way. The art style and sound was crisp and colorful. The character design and development was well done and seems very thought out. I enjoyed this anime very, very much.",

            "content": "This review contains spoilers but are separated by a very obvious and large warning, so you can read spoiler free until the very big obvious warning.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nThe story is very very slow at first. Within the first 5 episodes I thought it was going to be like Detective Conan where they just solve random cases. Everything seems so, random in that sense. It's not until episode 7 or 8 where they start using cliffhangers and actual character and story development. After episode 7 everything starts clicking and making sense and feeling less random. So if you start you have to at least get to episode7 before dropping it, I wanted to but it was worth not dropping it.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nNot much to say here, gonna make my generic complaint about using CGI for cars and such, I personally don't like it. Besides that everything looks amazing, the artwork is beautiful for what it is.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nWhile the OP isn't particularly amazing or catchy, it fits it perfectly, but this is not why I gave it a 10. I gave it a 10 for the sound design and effects, they really went all out for this one for sound design. Effects are used properly, there's never an empty feel that isn't right in it. Also the background music helped create the exact atmosphere they wanted. I wish more anime would focus in sound because of how much of an important role it plays.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\r\nAs I said in the first story part, there isn't very much development until about episode 7. Well actually there is but it's very very slow and doesn't make sense until about then. Also another comment is that I feel the main boy character (Don't remember his name) doesn't feel developed enough, which I think isn't too fair since it's in his POV. I can't say much more about this category without spoilers so rest will be in the spoiler section at the bottom.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime, it really was amazing sucking you into the moment. However sadly the overall story and character development was a tiny bit off/lacking in my opinion. Again this is probably due to the story still being written, but as far as I know there is no plans for a second season.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nThe only reason this gets boosted to an 8/10 is because of the sound. I cannot stress how important sound can be in an anime. The rest of the review is my thoughts on mostly character and story which contains spoilers, so if you haven't watched it yet, don't read it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nWARNING SPOILERS STOP READING IF YOU DON'T WANT TO GET SPOILED.\\n\r\nNON SPOILER REVIEW IS OVER.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nI'm going to merge characters in with this part so the character section will be minimal, probably the best to not spoil anyways. I have a few problems with the story, I know the light novel is still running so it makes sense for it to end the way it did, so maybe the following is addressed later on in the story of the light novel or something. It is established early that the main girl character (I can't be bothered to remember Japanese names that aren't easy to remember, even though her name is the title) has a fiance. But you only hear of him about 2 times in the whole anime, what a waste of development that could've gone somewhere. You could've left out that she had a fiance and literally not a SINGLE thing would've changed. \\n\r\nThe ending was amazing though, but in a way you wouldn't have guessed. I felt it was directed at me almost. \"Welcome, to the abyss\" which if you have watched it (Hopefully or you got spoiled) you would know that's a quote. It felt directed at me because I got sucked into the abyss that is this anime, I'm up at 4:52 am writing this review after binging the whole thing. I couldn't stop after episode 7. Another problem I have with the anime is more of a character issue but this is just my tastes and opinion. The main girl tries so hard to be edgy and as if she has no human feelings and that she's above it, when she clearly is not. I understand that is her character and I wouldn't want it any different but just not too much my cup of tea, even for anime. Another thing that confused me so much is that whether or not this is a Sci-Fi or fantasy anime. At some parts it seems they go back in time in a visualization, and this could very well be for the looks or expressing the story better but there's one flaw. He reacts to hit. It happens more than once and he looks startled every time and he acts like it is actually happening. Can they see back into other peoples past? Is this for helping the viewer understand? But if so why is he confused about what's happening? Anyways, not too important since it's not focused on.\\n\r\nOne other comment I have is how well the anime tries not to confuse the viewer, on the last episode where time frames are constantly switching back and forth, it marks them very very clear on what's happening. Extra props for that. Extra note on the characters section. The side characters (the 3 friends one) get developed more than the main character. That's sad IMO. I mean at one point in a flashback we see people who could potentially be his parents but it never tells us. I get there was probably more important things to include but the first 6 episodes had plenty of space to establish that! Sorry for this section being a bit unorganized, but think of it as the overall but with spoilers.",

            "content": "I feel that a lot of people are misjudging/missing the point of this anime. It even states it in the OP \"A Story Dedicated to Those Trapped by the Past\", this is not a mystery series. It's a story on grief and moving on. \r\nHaving said that, if you watch the background carefully throughout the entirety of the series there are cherry blossoms and lots of them. This incites the feeling of Spring and thus New Beginnings. For the most part the series is quite light-hearted with more comical scenes than a normal mystery series should rightfully have however, there's a level of uncertainty that'ssuggested by Shoutarou's actions and hesitancy regarding Sakurako's behavior. This reflects our uncertainty and regret when overcoming our grief. \\n\\n\r\nI believe the creator chose the mystery/murder theme because most people can relate to losing a loved one and it's not something that's easily overcome. \\n\\n\r\nThe mystery lover in me wishes that the serial case would have been introduced sooner and thus would have created a more mystery like setting but that would have ruined the creator's original purpose in. \\n\\n\r\nThe series doesn't pull its punches when it comes to revealing the depravity in human hearts nor its ultimately kind nature. I also loved that the series constantly brought up the \"Two Truths\", meaning that truth is somewhat relative to the knowledge we have and so is different for each person and each situation. \\n\\n\\n\r\nHaving said all that if you watch this series expecting an awesome Sherlock Holmes type series you will be disappointed. There isn't enough factual substance for that, however if you come to the series looking for what it is actually giving  then I doubt you will walk away feeling unsatisfied. In short, I think this series is a masterpiece for taking on a very depressing topic and turning it into a neutral subject that's actually fun to watch and experience.",

            "content": "Have you heard of a title more intriguing than 'Corpses are Buried at Sakurako's Feet'?\r\nAs I open the first episode, the almost provocatively thoughtful dialogue and beautiful animation draw me in completely. I decide that I am going to love this show. As Sakurako finds a new corpse, exquisite animal skeletons parade about her and an aura of mystery builds. It is all very sinister, and yet so beautiful.\r\nBut then I rate it a 7- what happened?\r\nThe story's biggest turnoff is that it is a clueless mystery with a Sherlock Holmes air to it. Sakurako's trite declaration before she unravels a mystery quickly becomes repetitive.As the show begins to hint romances, I become further wary. The story takes on an episodic format which ties poorly with its short length. Despite my disinterest in episodic mystery, I hold on to my expectations because of a line in the opening theme: something like 'The two sides of a coin come together as pieces of the same puzzle', and this little message, 'Dedicated to Those Stuck in the Past' (which sounds pretty deep) hinting that there's more to the story than seems. And so I wait, and try to catch every little detail because there's presumably going to be final grand arc where all the mysteries come together. I'm left waiting.. (Although I cannot satisfactorily explain why, or even why it  might have be okay to have been left waiting without possibly revealing spoilers.)\\n\\n\r\nSakurako, the character, is an unlikely combination of unconventional and cliche. While characters with dark, peculiar obsessions are not uncommon in anime, such a character is rarely portrayed in positive light, or even non-maniacally, let alone as relatable. Sakurako achieves this. I learn that it is no social obligation to become queasy at the sight of a corpse and grow to see death in new light as Sakurako harps with fascination the bounty of life a body is transformed into after death. I feel myself grow darker. Then I tire of Sakurako's inexplicable deductions with the sad excuse of 'this much is just speculation'- and yet, eventually, I am forced to accept Sakurako as a woman of logic. Even so, the hackneyed combination of beauty and brains seemed at best, unnecessary.\\n\\n\r\nShoutarou, on the other hand, is generic in every possible way. There is very little to identify him as a unique character, beyond a smarter than average happy high school student at least as yet- so I will describe him no further.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in Sakurako-san is not elaborate, but it's pleasant and beautiful and the kind of animation that makes your eyes happy. From the cherry blossoms of late spring, through Beautiful Bones' erranous season shifts, even through depictions of corpses and skeletons, the art seems sublime. Sakurako-san probably has the best art I've seen in any anime.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Sakurako has left me disappointed. When I  started watching this show, I wanted and expected to like it far more. I wanted to rate it a 9 or a 10, but now, its inconclusitivity makes a 7 feel like an allowance. The show feels devoid of a real message, which it foreplayed  too much for its pathetic bathos. Is this show really even over?\\n\\n\r\nSakurako-san is a good mystery show, but not very much more. It will appeal to two kinds of viewers:\\n\r\nA.\tPeople looking for a good episodic mystery\\n\r\nB.\tPeople looking for thoughtful dialogue (Although this isn't what the show focuses on, there's a reasonable amount of it happening)\\n\r\nPick this show up if you\u2019re one of the two. Beautiful Bones might not become your favourite show but it will still have been worth watching.",

            "content": "Mystery is one of the touchier genres of anime.  This is because in order to do a good mystery, you have to choose either one overarching mystery, or several little ones.  Both of which have their own little hurdles in order to be successful.  And so, we have Sakurako-san, a show that deals with a very odd kind of Sherlock Holmes kind of scenario, with bones.  Lots of them.  \r\nStory:  Shoutarou is a boy who tries to differ from the normal.  Rather than spend time with other people his age, every day after school, Shoutarou goes into thewoods and finds a big mansion.  Inside, is a woman named Kujou Sakurako, an osteologist who has a fascination in reforming specimens out of the bones she finds.  As such, our dastardly duo finds bones at every turn, solving the mysteries of the skeletons they find.\\n\\n\r\nGoing for a more episodic route for storytelling, each episode or two of Sakurako-san follows our two main characters as they go about the town and stumble or are given tasks that usually involve some aspect of mystery to them.  Usually, there are bones involved, Sakurako and/or Shoutarou figure out the case, and the entire mini plot is done.  Finish, rinse, and repeat.  For the entire runtime of the show, Sakurako-san follows this format of storytelling and really bolsters itself as a decent show for a good while.  However, there are quite a few flaws with this formula that created a lot of cracks in the marrow of this show, and in the end, made all of the pieces fall out of place.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the bigger issues of Sakurako-san is its inherent plotline of being just the same thing over and over again.  There's little to no variety as to what the characters do.  This however, is not the main issue for the show, though it is a small bit of a problem going in.  The real problem of this show comes with the fact that Sakurako-san tries to also do a bit of an overarching story, throwing in hints early on in the series.  Now, this wouldn't be much of an issue if the show focused on that in its latter half.  It didn't.  Instead, for the latter part of the show, we get a mesh of overarching and episodic story that just doesn't mesh together well.  As a result, the story suffered greatly and a lot of what made Sakurako good in the beginning, just wasn't there to hold it up in the end.  \\n\\n\r\nBut what really was the kicker was the fact that Sakurako-san's ending was the final nail in the coffin.  The last episode was just a complete waste of time and really didn't do the series any favors since it was just a backstory that I personally didn't care about.  Not only that, but it really didn't have any impact on the issues that were at hand, and as such, left that 'overarching' feeling that was sprinkled in throughout the series as dead weight that didn't mean very much in the end.  Still need some answers!  (It's also got this butterfly motif that they didn't really do much of anything with since the character it was tied to was barely even there.)\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Good start\\n\r\n+  Decent episodic mysteries\\n\r\n-   Bad ending\\n\r\n-   Overarching mystery didn't come to fruition/was bad\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:  Sakurako-san really only has two characters that are worth mentioning.  That is, our Sherlock Holmes duo of Sakurako and Shoutarou.\\n\\n\r\nAs the title character and most important person in the series, Sakurako is someone who really enjoys bones.  Every day she arranges new skeletons and is able to tell the kind of things that has been happening to a body due to her extensive knowledge on bone structure.  As such, she is a very intelligent character and at times, throws caution to the wind.  She plays the 'Sherlock Holmes' of the series, as she is the one that solves almost all of the cases and does the majority of the work in any given set of mystery bones that are found.  She's a bit of an oddball character that has an assumedly traumatizing backstory added to her.  Problem is, we don't get much backstory.  Instead, we're left with a character that freaks out over something that we don't know and have to infer.  (Not like it was hard to do, but it's not really right to do that to the audience.)  She as a character had a lot of potential and while fulfilled most of it, just didn't have that final push to make her great.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have Shoutarou, the 'Watson' of the duo.  As the sidekick to Sakurako and the POV character of the series, we don't really get much about him.  He mostly just aids Sakurako in her duties whenever she finds a new bone case, and as such sort of acts like the second brain on the trip.  He himself isn't really all that developed of a character and only acts as an anchor to make sure she doesn't go too far whenever she's enchanted by the bones of an adult male, cat, fox, what have you. This is largely due to the fact that Shoutarou represents more as the 'outside' character, looking into Sakurako's world.  A world that is still shrouded in mystery due to the lack of focus on the backstory that we were hinted at.\\n\\n\r\nOther characters are pretty much characters that pertain to certain cases with the exception of a few on account of their appearance in other cases.  But for the most part, characters only pertain to a singular story or situation regarding someone's murder, be it a family member or the one who committed the crime, everyone else is pretty much just fodder for story progression and really nothing else.  Bit sad, cause I liked Yuri.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Sakurako-san  (Even without her backstory fully explained, she drove the show as much as she could.)\\n\r\n-  Shoutarou is pretty much just along for the ride\\n\r\n-  Side characters are all pretty much plot based and nothing more\\n\\n\r\nArt:  Made by Troyca, a new animation studio who helped work on Aldnoah Zero, the artstyle for Sakurako is quite grey and dull in comparison to a more lighter style.  Since most of the show relates to death and the loss of a loved one, the artstyle reflects that by having everything be mellowed out in color.  As such, the atmosphere fits the show and it's really, really nice.  \\n\\n\r\nIn addition, the animation quality for Sakurako is very nice.  There are little to no flaws with the way that this show was produced, and I have nothing bad to say about the way the show looks.  Especially when Sakurako puts that glove on and the moving skeletons pop up.  God that was good; wish they used it more.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Fitting Color scheme\\n\r\n+  Good animation\\n\r\n+  Dat Cast starting animation.  (Why didn't you use it more!!!)\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound for Sakurako is unique, to say the least.  Rather than an instrumental OST, the OP and ED for Sakurako both utilize more electronic beats that give it a more somber and melancholic feel to reflect the theme of death that this series talks about since every skeleton has a story about how it died.  I wouldn't say that these are memorable tracks, but they are a couple of really nice ones that add in to overall aesthetic of the show.  A+ in my book.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment:  The Fall 2015 season was...disappointing, and that was putting it lightly.  There were only a few shows that I declared mid-season were worth watching; Sakurako-san was one of them.  Though, as the season came to a close, I was disappointed at how one of the better shows in this season just sort of shot itself in the foot at the last second, turning something that I looked forward to every week, into something that was a little bit weird in terms of pacing and where it was going.\\n\\n\r\nDid I like this anime?\\n\\n\r\nUp until the last couple episodes, Sakurako-san had a very solid start that I was really happy about.  It defined what it wanted to do in the beginning and I had high hopes for what it would accomplish.  (Until they were turned into dust, of course.)  Sakurako is also a character that I enjoyed, as she is very different and has depth to her character, even if we didn't see all of that depth.  Aesthetics as well, can't complain.  Also, 10/10, would Hector again.  (FLUFFY DOG!)\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this anime?\\n\\n\r\nAside from the fact that Sakurako created a BS plot at the end that left a lot of questions rather than answers and the waste of time last episode, Shoutarou himself was an issue I had.  He just didn't seem to have much of a personality since all he did was stand behind Sakurako and act as the layman so Sakurako would explain all of the sciency and analyzing stuff that was happening on screen at that time.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime?\\n\\n\r\nAs a mystery anime, I would say that this rates about average, like most mystery.  It's definitely one of the better shows this season, but the doesn't mean it's really good.  It's still worth a shot since I find Sakurako to be quite a fascinating gal, and for no reason other than because it is Sakurako.  That being said however, if you choose to watch this, just skip the last episode.  It's...pretty worthless, I'll be completely honest with you.",

            "content": "Sakurako-san no Ashimoto ni wa Shitai ga Umatteiru is a firmly middle-of-the-road series with a handful of modest strengths and a fair selection of minor flaws.  I enjoyed the show overall, though perhaps to the bare minimum extent to justify watching it again.  It often feels as though several steps were skipped in the creation of this show, or that a number of details should have been questioned by somebody along the way and never got cut.  I find most grating the fact that Sakurako is not an actual detective, even though it would have cost nothing to make her one fromthe outset and this single detail makes the entire series a mere cavalcade of conveniences.  The series revolves around her and Shoutarou finding corpses, solving mysteries, and showing up the local police like any good Holmes and Watson, but Sakurako has no stated justification for following through with any of these actions.  She digs (up) bones, not criminal investigation.  Instead of simply casting Sakurako as an official detective who might be routinely called to crime scenes and have the authority to perform investigations, every episode has to find some new contrivance to put her in close proximity to a mysterious body and then at the helm of an official pursuit.  Making Sakurako a forensic specialist would have made a lot more sense than making her an osteologist who is related to a coroner, possesses inexplicable powers of deduction, and conveniently finds herself embroiled in some new scheme every week.\\n\\n\r\nSakurako\u2019s investigations, despite being named in the title as very much an important part of the series, don\u2019t get spared a great deal of air time.  All CSI-type shows are guilty of condensing the amount of paperwork, research, critical thinking, and general grunt work associated with solving crimes, of course, but Sakurako-san no Ashimoto ni wa Shitai ga Umatteiru doesn\u2019t even pretend to care that few crimes are solved within a ten-minute span.  No matter the situation, whatever piece of information that needs to be known in order to solve the mystery just happens to be known by Sakurako.  Her expertise has no boundaries, so long as it helps hurry the episode to a safe conclusion.  Hour-long live action series often have trouble slimming down a full investigation to a single-episode arc; this show moves much too quickly for any of the cases to seem realistic or for any of the events to have a significant impact.  \\n\\n\r\nMost of the characters do not warrant description, Shoutarou included.  Shoutarou, despite being the lens through which the audience sees the events unfold, exists largely as a walking apology for Sakurako.  Every time Sakurako says something blunt or takes a rather presumptive action, Shoutarou swoops in to admonish her in front of the other characters and thereby allow Sakurako to get away with whatever it is she happens to be doing at the time.  He performs a necessary function, and if it were not for the hints at some sort of real back story to their relationship, I\u2019d suggest that Sakurako took him on as an assistant purely for this reason.  I find Utsumi obnoxious, Kougami a blank space, and the dog a more compelling character than most of the other faces nudging their way into the spotlight now and again.  Only Sakurako herself is particularly interesting to watch; while literature and television alike are flooded with better examples of the aloof, impersonal genius detective archetype, Sakurako also isn\u2019t the worst example.  Shizuka Itou does a great job of bringing Sakurako\u2019s personality to life with a commanding, insensitive, impartial voice that sounds genuinely confused when other characters get caught up with things like emotions and routine human behavior.  Sakurako is aggressive, impatient, and surprisingly childlike at times, all of which further necessitate the need for a mediator in the form of Shoutarou, and all of which make her slightly more interesting by putting her at odds with those unfortunate enough to become involved in her investigations.  The manner in which the show describes Sakurako and the manner in which Sakurako acts don\u2019t gel perfectly, but I also don\u2019t care quite enough to be bothered by the inconsistency.\\n\\n\r\nFor a bone-themed mystery show with a corpse around every corner, Sakurako-san no Ashimoto ni wa Shitai ga Umatteiru feels very much like a quaint, saccharine \u201890s sitcom at times.  Not content to contrive conflicts for each episode, the show often drags out side characters to participate in the weekly drama on the flimsiest pretenses.  Some characters do actually receive a fair amount of development across episodes, but at the cost of being awkwardly shoehorned into various scenarios.  The show winds up with an unfortunate trade-off: we learn a bit more about some of these people, but first we have to tolerate them being there at all.  On a few instances, we\u2019re treated to a perfectly schmaltzy, \u201cHey, remember so-and-so?  Yeah, they\u2019re doing just fine now!\u201d  Often the show feels too light-hearted, with bright lighting, a general lack of consequences, and even occasional instances of low-key fan service that, while reasonable to include if the teenage Shoutarou\u2019s point of view is taken into account, don\u2019t pretend to make any sort of real statement or push the show in any other direction.  All it does is confuse the tone of the show.  I find the attempts at wringing serious philosophy out of these situations as obnoxious as they are overbearing.\\n\\n\r\nThe last few episodes make the show feel more like a respectable mystery series; the solutions aren\u2019t immediately obvious, the characters interact with each other in subtler ways, and a lot more is at stake emotionally and physically.  I wonder if the show might succeed more if it could pick one major arc and stick with it over the course of a season, rather than chopping itself up into discrete episodes.  Even at its best, Beautiful Bones still has quite a few issues, but if there were ever to be a second season, the show could be salvaged with moderate success.\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals are probably the show\u2019s strong suit.  I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s worth watching just for the pretty colors, but at least there\u2019s something interesting to look at if (read: when) the plot begins to drag.  The backgrounds are often beautiful and detailed, with usually a few scenes per episode getting a very special treatment that makes everything pop.  In the first few episodes, Sakurako gets a trippy magical girl transformation sequence when she begins investigating a scene, replete with catchphrase.  With bright, entrancing colors and a captivating proggy, jazzy soundtrack, this sequence is a pearl that helps the show escape its mundane surroundings just for a moment.  Even if the transformation does become slightly tedious after the first couple of instances, I love the idea of introducing such surreal elements.  A lot of the budget very clearly went into the visuals already, but given a bit more style and vibrance, I could forgive the show a lot more of its failings.\\n\\n\r\nFor all the show\u2019s flaws and all the problems I have with it, I actually enjoyed watching Sakurako quite a bit.  Nothing is offensively wrong with the show, only foolish or silly.  I like watching Sakurako herself messily harangue her way through other people\u2019s business, and though I had anticipated a much darker, less episodic foray into the depths of the criminal underworld, I\u2019ll take a casual stroll through a monster-of-the-week curiosity anyway.\\n",

I guess I'll just state what I liked and felt about this anime, I'll try not to include spoilers as much as possible.\r\nI always have this thing about light mystery because I'm not fond of overly serious mystery genre and Sakurako-san really hit that spot of me. Rather than mystery oriented, Sakurako-san is like slice of life with drama and little twists of light mystery.\r\nHaving this cliche high-school themed filled with force romance and fanservice anime over here and there, this anime is a breather for me and I always have this smile whenever I watch each of episode of thisbut don't get me wrong, Sakurako-san get's serious when it needs to be. The story is actually good and the pacing is also good. I know I'll raise some eyebrows because a lot of review said that it's rushed and pacing was terrible, but have you forgotten that this is a mystery and a lot of mystery either anime or novel tends to get quirky about pacing of the story? Well enough of the pacing I guess,\\n\r\nSakurako-san is a light mystery which tells each story that can actually happen in real life, that's why i view it as a slice of life. It does not goes beyond over exaggerating the mystery element but rather take account the scenarios that can take place in real life And instead of throwing some heavy words to try to be serious, this anime takes real life point of view. Comes with beautiful arts and story telling which TROYCA magnificently delivered. Opening, ending and ost tracts that gives the feeling of lightness despite being a mystery. I was truly amazed of what the anime showed and makes me feel positive about living. It on par with the Hyouka feeling I felt back then!\\n\\n\r\nBut Probably for anyone who expects with grand showdown of intelligence like in other heavy mystery stories out there but definitely a mystery anyone could appreciate to if you just try to appreciate. You don't need to be really smart just to understand the mystery element, you just have to view it realistically to an extent.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOver all it is a must watch  for those who have a thing for light mystery and for those fed up of cliched anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI'll just end my review with the quote I really like from Sakurako-san\\n\\n\\n\r\n\"Listen It's always you who stops time. If you stop in fear of the future, you gain nothing And nothing begins. You spend your life as though you're already dead.\"\\n\\n\\n\r\nthen Thank you very much for reading.\\n\\n",

Or the outcome to complicated. But you never know... Someone else my watch this call everything and call it boring. But I highly doubt it. This is a series that has light hearted moments that make you smile, heart pounding moments that have you on theedge of your seat. Worried sick for the characters, Thought provoking moments. and well a couple pretty damn dark moments as well.\\n\\n\r\nHey if your still unsure about weather or not you want to watch Beautiful Bones.

            "content": "If you're going to watch this series, do it for the mysteries, not the plot.\r\nYou know those kind of series that are always episodic and every now and then it gives you a hint that somehow it really has a background story (to never really unravel it)? This is one of those. The basis for everything is Sakurako and her love for bones, being an osteologist. She and Shoutarou are friends(?) and like to unearth bones to add them to Sakurako's large skeletal collection. Oh, and they solve mysteries regarding those bones as well.\r\nI'm having a tough time trying to write about how does themystery come to the pair and what makes them solve it. In many other detectivesque anime the justification is: the MC's a detective, they maybe like the whole mystery stuff or they've /just/ got to solve mysteries in order to survive, I don't know. In Sakurako-san, however, the pair solves mysteries because... they can? There is no tangible justification for the duo to go around town mystery-solving instead of bone-fetching. Those mysteries MAY have a reason to exist though, as Shoutarou says, everytime he goes around with Sakurako they end up finding bodies (or how the title says, there is a corpse under Sakurako's feet).\\n\\n\r\nThe point is: There are some hints thrown at you that every mystery they find may have its cause and everything, there may be a background plot that makes everything have sense... and that's it. The \"story\" never unravels itself.The main cast is basically Sherlock Holmes (Sakurako) and Watson (Shoutarou). One of the things that bugged me the most is that Sakurako is so intelectually \"overpowered\" that the show loses all credibility, and worst of all, her manner of speaking spoils the mysteries. What I'm saying with the \"overpowered\" thing is that taking into account that she's an osteologist, most of her deductions don't feel like those of an osteologist but like those of a detective, making the show lose its basis. Moreover her way of solving the puzzles is very anticlimatic, spouting the answers all high and mighty, leaving no room for us viewers to speculate or even try to understand what's going on. This is a very important element that makes detectivesque works interesting: sharing the detective's stream of consciousness and internal monologues with the viewer/reader so that they can feel the mystery being solved. This made the pacing\\n\\n\r\nThe recurring side characters are rather average (you even have the classic airhead cop!) and to my taste they didn't have much development other than the episodes that centered on them. Background characters, such as those conscerning one or two episodes at most, are instead well explored when the mysteries revolve around them, and this is other of the few things I liked of the show.\\n\\n\r\nOn the positive side, the backgrounds are beautiful and vibrant. This is one of the aspects that I really enjoyed of the series, now this is a serious case of eye-candy. Character design is solid and not out of the ordinary, so not out of the ordinary that I kept thinking I was watching Kyoukai no Kanata specials. The soundtrack is fair (is it me or at the start of the series you hear many tracks with lead synthesizers and then never again?... it may be just me), but some of the voice acting (especially on old women) felt forced and fake at some moments.\\n\\n\r\nFor me this was barely an enjoyable series, even though the mysteries ARE interesting they are butchered whenever Sakurako solves them, which bugged me and made me lose all interest in keeping watching the series and credibility for the \"plot\".\\n\r\nIf you're going to watch this anime, do it for the mysteries, not for the plot.\\n\\n\r\nSo in short:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3/10\\n\r\n+ Good mysteries\\n\r\n- Slow pacing, lack of unraveling of the actual story, lack of actual story at all\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10 it's OK\\n\r\n+ Pure eye candy\\n\r\n+ Solid design\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\n+ Nothing out of the ordinary\\n\r\n- Forced voice acting\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5/10\\n\r\n+ Sherlock and Watson\\n\r\n+ Episodic characters get fair development\\n\r\n- Side characters don't get fair development\\n\r\n- Sakurako\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\r\n+ As I said eariler, good mysteries\\n\r\n- Sakurako's way of solving mysteries just bugs the hell out of me and made me lose interest and credibility in the series\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading.",

            "content": "Everyone has that one show every season that they're super excited for. Whether it be a continuation to a former series, an all-new creation from a favorite studio, or even a show just has an extremely pretty girl on the promo poster, us anime fans get ourselves psyched up over basically anything. For me, the conductor of the primary hype-train for Fall 2015 was Beautiful Bones or A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurako's Feet. \r\nThis mystery light novel adaptation follows the unlikely crime-solving duo of Kujou Sakurako, a well-off osteologist from a wealthy background, and Shoutaro Tatewaki, who is basically just some high school kid.This directorial debut from Makoto Katou is equally as youthful in the animation department, being only the second series animated by studio TROYCA (Aldnoah.Zero). The light novel, which goes by the same title as the anime, began publication in 2013 and is currently still adding more volumes to its name. The author and artist, Shiori Ota and Tetsuo respectively, once again exemplify how fresh this series is when you take into account just how little they worked on. Hell, even the two main voice actors have never been in an anime before. With an entire staff of people who could be considered \"freshmen\" by some others in their field, Beautiful Bones busted onto the scene with the notion of proving that the new guys in town can be just as good as the old veterans.\\n\\n\r\nThe series follows the typical arc format that many other series, primarily mysteries, have been utilizing as of late -- meaning that each individual mystery could consume anywhere from one to four episodes. As these arcs progress, the underlying plot line does as well. Actually, I'm not sure if \"Plot line\" is the right term to use there. The biggest part of this entire series is watching how the two protagonists grow and develop in terms of their relationship. As Sakurako and Shoutarou solve these mysteries, which are occurring at a suspiciously alarming rate, their thoughts of each other progress, in the same way, that the cases do. Shoutarou sees Sakurako as this astoundingly beautiful, overly smart grown woman that he still needs to watch after due to her sometimes absentmindedness. Sakurako, however, seems to view Shoutarou as sort of a replacement to someone she may have known in the past.The two become rather codependent on each other, and watching them grow is honestly the most entertaining (And important) part of the series.\\n\\n\r\nEach arc and each mystery you will encounter in Beautiful Bones is quite different than the next. Seeming, more often than not, like typical \"Foul play\" murder cases, each story has something buried deep down inside it that literally turns the case on its back. But, I mean, it wouldn't really be a mystery without that, right? More than half of the arcs wind up being exponentially darker than they seem at first which, depending on how you view the series, can be either incredibly entertaining and gripping or just flat out disturbing and uncalled for. My particular favorite (And I won't spoil it for you) is the final arc that details one of the strangest love triangles of all time. This arc actually goes on to introduce a bigger continuing plot that I'm sure the light novels make a huge deal of. However, considering this plot doesn't spring up until the last three or four episodes (And we only have 12), we don't get to see much of it. The plus side to this is that it leaves a metric ton of room for a second season if this one is received well enough.\\n\\n\r\nThis isn't a series where you're going to see Square Enix style, fashionably gorgeous characters, but instead characters that accentuate the realism of...well, reality. Each one seems more like someone you might encounter in town rather than an anime series -- which is awesome. This creates sort of a subconscious tie that viewers can create with particular characters that may remind us of some people we've actually met in real life before. Except Sakurako -- she's too perfect to be an emulation of an actual person. Along with character design, location and landscapes display a sense of realism that is both rejuvenating and nostalgic. Even the music shines in this series, spiraling into a chorus of enchanting violins when Sakurako activates detective mode. Beautiful Bones is well rounded in a multitude of ways, leaving only some rushed and confusing story aspects to drag it down.\\n\\n\r\nThe strangest thing about this series is how Sakurako is introduced. One of the first times we hear Shoutaro talk about her, he mentions that she is engaged to some guy somewhere or something. Then, we never see that guy, or even hear about him again. Hell, I don't think she even mentions him at all for the entire series. Maybe he shows up later in the light novels or something, but the way it seems to me is that this fiance guy was just thrown into the mixture to dispell feelings of intimacy between Sakurako and Shoutaro (Or, if you want to get weird, just make it more taboo). Not only is this weird and unnecessary as far as developing characters goes, it's just too safe of a decision for me. I mean, this is a series that highlight suicide, child abuse, more suicide, and a plethora of other things. But it draws the line at a relationship between an adult and kid who will be an adult in, what, two years? Personally, if you're going to weave a tale centered on co-dependency, I don't think you should throw random obstacles in the way. Any obstacle introduced should have a reason -- it shouldn't just be there for the sole purpose of complicating things.\\n\\n\r\nIn Summary:\\n\r\nBeautiful Bones boasts an \"Impressive on all fronts\" personality which only becomes bigger when you take into account how new every staff member is to the anime industry. Story arcs are deep and detailed with little self-censorship, which is essential for a mystery series. Character design is realistic while character personalities are relatable and intimate. Art design evokes a sense of nostalgia while still painting a beautiful portrait of an enchanting environment. The only thing that comes as a true hurdle to this series is some rushed conflict in terms of character relationships. As a whole, though, Beautiful Bones is a refreshing story of codependency between unlikely candidates that harkens back to stories like The Garden of Words. Room for a second season only makes it better.",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAIN SPOILERS\r\nMystery animes should make you always curious to know what will happen the next episode. This one doesn't.\r\nThis anime presented great potential at the beginning, showing Sakuraro and the \"Shounen\" discovering a person's bones and solving the mystery behind their death. I thought it would be like that the whole series. But then, it changed.\r\nThe cases they solved were really boring and some even useless, it just didn't make me want to know what happened, because for me it really didn't matter. Then the story continued with some (light) drama and raising our curiosity showing a little of Sakurako's past, but atthat point it isn't that much interesting anymore, it seems rather obvious what will happen.\\n\r\nWhat caught most of my curiosity was: who the hell is Sakurako's fiance?\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nReally well made character's expressions. Background full of details. Coloring is also great, really vivid (I guess I could say that.)\\n\\n\r\nStory: 4/10\\n\r\nThe show is very slow paced, even too much. There are some useless episodes that don't add anything up to the story, but overall is nice.\\n\r\nHard to say this but, the \"explanation\" is really good. What I mean is that they introduce the case to us with many details, and develop the story from that point flawlessly, but that's what causes the a anime to be very slow paced.\\n\r\nDifferently from what I expected from the begging, solving the mysteries is not something thrilling. They try to make something dramatic but it doesn't feel all that deep and I can't really relate to anything, so it just feels shallow. I have the impression that it's sometimes forced, because they try to make a big deal out of little stuff.  For example in the episode which the Yuri girl lost her grandmother. They made it sound like her world ended, and yet the old lady was already missing, so it was expected that she was dead. And yet they make it look like something really sad. Maybe some people will identify themselves with the girl, call me cold but, I simply don't have the compassion to feel sorry for her.\\n\r\nThe true story begins at episode 10, when the anime is ending they start what should've been already solved by that time.\\n\r\nEnding an anime the way they did, only if they are certain of another season, because basically everything was left unsolved.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nBackground music is good, sound effects fit in perfectly, opening and ending themes are also great.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10\\n\r\nThe story doesn't help the genius MC because the cases are really boring, so solving them doesn't make the MC look as smart as she is. \\n\r\nBut I still like her and how cold she is, asking questions with no remorse and then solving everything on her own.\\n\r\nSomething which bothered me a lot was that the personalities of some of the supporting characters somewhat changed through the story. Not some big change, but at some parts they acted outside their character, for example the Sensei, at one episode he acted really cool and said some nice stuff, but at the next episode he didn't leave his mark and it really annoys me these subtle changes.\\n\r\nSomething else that bugs me is that whimpy cry-baby shounen. Can't he shut up? And why does he feel sick when he sees bones? They are just freakin' bones.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\r\nGood as it is, it just doesn't make me cry out for more episodes, desperately refreshing the page, begging for the release of an new episode.\\n\r\nWell, that was too much, but you get the picture.\\n\r\nEven though I really appreciate a good drama and mystery, this one doesn't make any of them truly enjoyable, leaving nothing else for the viewers.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6 (Fine)\\n\r\nSakurako-san no Ashimoto ni wa Shitai ga Umatteiru is entertaining but it lacks depth to its story.\\n\r\nShowed great potential but it really disappointed me.",

Honestly, the story was intriguing and each and every part. By the end I was even left wanting another season as where it ended off was a perfect way to continue the story. \r\nArt\r\nThe art was superb as it was actually stunning. I would say near Kimi No Na Wa beauty, in some scenes. The first few scenes would be when you first meet Sakurako and when she puts her gloves on for the first time. The colors andanimation were stunning and it is consistently done well through the show. \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nSound was great and even helped put a feeling of absolute horror. The episodes deal with death so it makes sense that the music was fitting for such a tragic and scary event.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nSakurako the beautiful and extremely odd. Her odd obsession with bones is weird at first, but honestly it's very interesting. Her love for bones is what allows mysteries to be resolved. Though she doesn't show her feelings of care directly, you can tell she truly loves and cares for her friend and grandma.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nI randomly ran across this show by just scrolling through crunchyroll and I am extremely happy I found this unknown show. It was super interesting and I truly hope a season 2 will come out for this, but I doubt it will. Also, just because of this show I am going to try watching more mysteries.",

I just don't get why they stopped the animation for her when she puts on the gloves after half of the anime...\r\nThe opening theme is perfect, with Ulna and Radius and that kid's skull....but we never found out who that kid is......by Sakurako is so true and relatable, I might just start to study bone if I want to learn the truth....\\n\r\nI enjoyed the small horrors in the music. But that moment when they finally, specifically, mention the antagonist, which is at the 11th episode, a bit late...LMAO\\n\\n\r\nAlso this is like Detective Conan, I mean, every ep includes a dead person. Conan has experience more deaths than in WW1 (to avoid the offense for those taken if I were to mention WW2 or any genocide) \\n\\n\\n\r\nAll in all 10/10 cause I love Sakurako and she is my role model heh ;)",

            "content": "I haven't watched the TV series \"Bones\" but I guess the anime I'll be reviewing today has at least a similar topic.  It is a crime/mystery anime that has a very intriguing plot and a very interesting main character. The anime with the longest name I have seen so far: Sakurako-san no Ashimoto ni wa Shitai ga Umatteiru or the English version: A Corps is Buried under Sakurako's feet. Sounds creepy and is a little bit but it's amazing at the same time. Have fun! \r\nPLOT AND STORY LINE \r\nThis is with great extend one of the best mystery and crime I have seen.An anime from the Fall 2015  season and a Lantis production, the same producers of some of Mirai Nikki, One Ounch Man, Another and many more popular anime. In my opinion it deserves a better score than 7.5 on MAL and here is all why:\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, the story is told in a very interesting way. I kind of retrospective way of telling while the narrator is also the main character of the story Tatewaki Shoutarou. Shoutaru tell us his life story after meeting Kujou Sakurako,  an osteologist he spends a lot of time with and helps her with her work. Everyday they encounter new mysteries and try to solve unsolved cases that all involve...bones of course. He soon learns that bones may tell the way someone died, but never why. The 'why' and how they lived can only be told by people. \\n\r\nSecondly, the plot is kinda made up of cases and some smaller stories but the actual story is much more mysterious and intriguing. Trough the anime you get those hints that make you think about the possibilities of what might have happened and you'll eventually find out...later...when season 2 comes out. There exists a manga but I can't find a page where I could actually read it. Nevertheless, the 'real' story of the anime involves her uncle and her brother if I got it right from the hints and her flashbacks. It's not hard to tell that the story has a really emotional background and  will probably have an interesting outcome. Some rapid scenes and flashes in the anime actually make you realize how most of the cases they solve are connected to each other in one or the other way. It adds up to the excitement and keeps you long enough on tenterhooks to make you finish the anime in only one day.  And in the end it makes you cry because it has only 12 episodes. \\n\r\nThirdly, the anime has so many morals. It is impossible how good they display the value of life and how they actually make you believe that everyone's life story is special even tough the person lived a simple life. At this point I want to share two of Sakurako-san's quotes that are truly amazing:\\n\r\n    \"But time never stops. It moves forward endlessly, as surely as bodies burried in the ground will one day become white bones.  Listen, it's always you who stops time. If you stop in fear of future-you gain nothing and nothing begins. You spend your life as though already dead. Wheather you wish it or not- time never stops.\" \\n\r\n\" Don't be too negative. You haven't become ashes just yet.\" \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS \\n\\n\r\nWhere was I, oh yeah...Reason 4: \\n\\n\r\nYes, one more reason that this anime is truly amazing are the characters. When it comes to Lantis production all the anime have overly good characters. In Beautiful Bones (A synonym name for the anime) the diversity of characters is huge and they all contribute to the story in a unique but even way. Of course, Sakurako is the highlight of the story and so is her personality. The thing about her is that she behaves in a childish way but is actually a mastermind when it comes to solving cases and discovering secrets. And even tough her actions are funny most of the time, she also gets really emotional and mature from time to time too. Right after finishing the anime, I added her to my favorite character list on MAL. She is independent yet down to earth and emotional. I always loved this type of characters. And I actually never mentioned her huge passion for bones. She loves bones and has a lot of reconstructed animal skeletons at home. \\n\\n\r\nANIMATION AND STYLE\\n\\n\r\nAnd here comes reason 5: the animation and the style of the anime are as amazing as the anime it self. The animation is basically an 'as expected' since the anime is a  2015 production. The style is important here. I can't really tell what it is that stands out so much. I think it's the bright colors and the way they do that 'now let's solve the mystery' scene. Whatever it is, the style makes the anime really unique and makes you not forget it so easy. In addition to that, it makes you enjoy the anime even more. As for me, animation and style are really important and they surely have influence on my anime choice. Right now, I have a really hard time watching Clannad because the style is just horrible. \\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION\\n\\n\r\nLet's conclude. There are on the whole 5 reasons why you should watch Sakurako-san no Ashimoto ni wa Shitai ga Umatteiru or Beautiful Bones: Sakurako's Investigation right now and there is not a single reason why you shouldn't. The anime is perfect for all of you that like crime and mystery anime and those who love using their brain figuring it out on their own.",

            "content": "[Review in English and Spanish]\r\n[English]\r\nI started to watch this show with no expectations at all, but it surprised me in many aspects. First of all, I give all the credit to the one that picked the title: awesome title! It made me look for it in Google and find about Kajii Motojiro's short, beautiful story, I really appreciate that. I recommend to watch this show as a mystery show and in that view I think is a good one. Because...\r\nStory (10)\r\nThere is a high structure that leads to a big story, but that story has been turned apart using the metaphor of the bones, soin each episode a bone is revealed and little by little all the bones of the high level picture are getting together and by the end of this season we have a litle bit more clarity about the main story of this anime. This progressive revelation of the story is very pleasant in my opinion, because it is well done (it accomplishes with the requirements of mistery stories where the clues are presented to the viewer/reader, so he/she can infer at the same time along with the characters the story resolution), and, which is the most valuable aspect, it is not predictable! (And I highlight this because after you have watched/read lots of mystery shows/novels, everything seems easy and predictable). To me, the clearest sign that the story is good is that I can't wait for the next season! Even if the characters did not mark me at all, I want to find out how the story ends.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7)\\n\r\nBeautiful, clean, well picked colours. I like the way how the saturation and bright of colours change according to the scene/atmosphere/tension. But, nothing astonishing or outstandingly original.\\n\\n\r\nSound (5)\\n\r\nI hated the music! I think it is not helpful, it does not add anything good to the scenes or characters or the story, and worst of all, that \"classic\" (violins, etc.) style does not seem to suit with the story at all to me. Worst aspect, by far.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (6)\\n\r\nAs I said before, none of them really marked me, I don't feel any special sympathy by them. Of course Sakurako is the main character: this girl that is beautiful, super smart, and has a weird/sick fascination about bones and dead corpses. Is the usual trend to outline the \"special\" character with exotic personality/tastes/behaviour, but it is not impressive. However, they don't bother me either and in general they are a positive addition to the story and are quite coherent so far, according to the not so informative back up story that we know.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8)\\n\r\nAs I said, by far, the story is the most enjoyable aspect to me, the mysteries and how they are putting together the high level picture by using short stories that are related and that are mirrors of the main argument. Let's not forget the motto at the start \"for those who are trapped in the past\" (or something like that), it is indeed applied to each case and to the motivations of most of the characters (it is indeed a well used leit motive). The whole bones/butterflies business is interesting (not truly original, but well played). \\n\\n\r\nOverall (8)\\n\r\nI take this show as a mistery show and under that view I give it at 8, specially compared to other mistery animes that I have seen recently. Good use of general culture (japanese and occidental, e.g. Nietzsche quotes), forensic knowledge and human behaviour and psychology. Worth to watch, I recommend it, it is not a waste of time and I hope to see next season soon.\\n\\n\r\n[Spanish]\\n\\n\r\nComenc\u00e9 a ver esta serie sin ninguna expectativa, pero me sorprendi\u00f3 en muchos aspectos. Primero que nada, hay que darle todo el cr\u00e9dito a la persona que escogi\u00f3 el t\u00edtulo: qu\u00e9 buen t\u00edtulo! me hizo buscar esta frase en Google y encontrar el cuento de Kajii Motojiro, hermoso, realmente lo agradezco. Recomiendo ver esta serie como una serie de misterio y bajo esa mirada pienso que es una muy buena. Porque...\\n\\n\r\nHistoria (10)\\n\r\nHay una gran estructura que lleva hacia una gran historia pero esa historia ha sido separada usando la met\u00e1fora de los huesos, de tal forma que en cada episodio un hueso es revelado y poco a poco todos los huesos de la idea general son re-armados y hacia el final de la temporada ya se tiene un poco m\u00e1s de claridad de cu\u00e1l es la historia principal de este anim\u00e9.\\n\r\nEsta revelaci\u00f3n progresiva de la historia me parece muy agradable, porque est\u00e1 bien hecha (en el sentido de que cumple con los requisitos de las historias de misterio en las cuales las pistas son presentadas a los lectores/espectadores de tal manera que ellos/ellas puedan inferir en conjunto con los personajes el desenlace de la historia), y, lo m\u00e1s valioso, no es predecible! (y destaco esto porque despu\u00e9s de haber visto/le\u00eddo un mont\u00f3n de anim\u00e9s/libros de misterio todo se vuelve f\u00e1cil y predecible). Para m\u00ed el signo m\u00e1s patente de que la historia es buena es que no puedo esperar para ver la siguiente temporada! Incluso, a pesar de que los personajes no me marcaron para nada, quiero averiguar c\u00f3mo termina la historia.\\n\\n\r\nArte (7)\\n\r\nHermoso, limpio, con colores muy bien escogidos. Me gusta la manera en la saturaci\u00f3n y el brillo de los colores cambia de acuerdo a la escena/atm\u00f3sfera/tensi\u00f3n. Pero, nada impresionante ni espectacularmente original. \\n\\n\r\nSonido (5)\\n\r\nOdi\u00e9 la m\u00fasica! Me pareci\u00f3 que no ayudaba en nada, no a\u00f1ade nada bueno a las escenas, los personajes o a la historia, y lo peor de todo es que ese estilo \"cl\u00e1sico/docto\" (con violines, etc.) me pareci\u00f3 que no calzaba en absoluto con la historia. Lo peor de todo, por lejos.\\n\\n\r\nPersonajes (6)\\n\r\nComo dije antes, ninguno de ellos me marc\u00f3 realmente. No sent\u00ed ninguna empat\u00eda especial por ellos. Por supuesto, Sakurako es la protagonista: es una chica hermosa, muy inteligente, y que tiene una extra\u00f1a/enferma fascinaci\u00f3n por los huesos y los cad\u00e1veres. Es el intento usual de dibujar un personaje \"especial\" con una personalidad/gusto/comportamiento ex\u00f3tico, pero no es muy impresionante. Sin embargo, no me molestan tampoco y en general a\u00f1aden cosas buenas a la historia, y por ahora son coherentes con la poca historia personal que conocemos de cada uno.\\n\\n\r\nDisfrute (?) (8)\\n\r\nComo dije antes, lejos, la historia fue lo que m\u00e1s disfrut\u00e9, los misterios y c\u00f3mo est\u00e1n armando la historia principal usando las historias de cada episodio que est\u00e1n relacionadas con la primera y son reflejos de esta. No olvidemos el lema con que comienza la serie \"para aquellos que viven en el pasado\" (o algo as\u00ed), es ciertamente aplicado a cada caso y a las motivaciones de los personajes (es un real hilo conductor o motivo). Todo el tema de los huesos/mariposas es interesante (no muy original, pero bien propuesto).\\n\\n\r\nGeneral (8)\\n\r\nTomo esta seria como una serie de misterio y bajo ese alero le doy un 8, especialmente al compararla con otros anim\u00e9s de misterio que he visto recientemente. Buen uso de la cultura general (japonesa y occidental, como por ejemplo las citas a Nietzsche), conocimiento forense y el comportamiento y la psicolog\u00eda humana. Digno de ver, lo recomiendo, no es una p\u00e9rdida de tiempo y espero ver pronto la pr\u00f3xima temporada.",

            "content": "I laughed, I cried, I dropped my jaw and just couldn't seem to stop watching this anime. Just what is it about Sakurako-san no Ashimoto ni wa Shitai ga Umattei that drew me in, well, lets find out. \r\nSakurako-san no Ashimoto ni wa Shitai ga Umattei is what I would call an episodic mystery that to me is very entertaining, quite the emotional roller-coaster. In the same scene you can go from shedding a tear to laughing your tail off. The story is good in that while the episodes do have a slight connection they can stand on their own. With each episode or pairof episodes you get a new mystery to solve, albeit not overly difficult. There were a few moments where not overly suspenseful I did find my jaw hanging open even if for just a second. And that is one of the things that I really loved about this anime, I never knew how I was going to feel from one moment to the next.\\n\\n\r\nUpon watching the first episode I found myself captivated with the art. That is not to say that it was the most stylistic I have ever seen but it was done well and fit the theme to a tee. Not to mention the colors were crisp, warm and spoke to me as I watched ever excited to see episode after episode. \\n\\n\r\nThe music spoke to me as well. The opening and closing songs suited the anime just fine but it was the sound used within the anime that really played well with the setting. Always foreshadowing what would come next, which to me is very important. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were well done and I looked forward to spending time with them each episode. Unlike many other anime that I like I found that I fell in love with each character in the story rather than clinging to just one. For me this is unique and quite enjoyable. I also feel that the characters did well in supporting one another. That said, they could have stood alone if need be but that is simply not the case. The best part is that I could relate to the reactions of many of the secondary and tertiary characters in that even if something is mysterious and shocking I can not pull myself away and that is just how many of the characters reacted throughout this series. \\n\\n\r\nSakurako-san no Ashimoto ni wa Shitai ga Umattei is a series I went into with little expectations but was I ever wrong. In just a mere twelve episodes it made a rather hefty impact on my emotions and climbed its way into the second spot of my personal top ten rankings. Not only is it something that is memorable that I enjoyed watching but something that I know will add value each time I re-watch it. Defiantly a show I will be adding to my anime shelf when next I see it for sale (slightly complicated in my country). This is certainly an anime that I would recommend to others but I do understand that it is not for everyone as it is episodic. \\n\\n\r\nIs this the perfect anime, no, and I don't think that such a thing exists. If I could then I would give it a 9.5 out of 10 but as I can't it gets a solid 10. I chose such a rating not only for the enjoyment it gave me but how it made me feel and its ability to captivate my attention. \\n\\n\r\nTo summarize, this is a wonderful anime that is worth your time. Particularly if you go in with no expectations and try to not compare it to other mystery anime that you might have seen. I know that is hard but it stands on its own two feel in its unique way. \\n",

If you just think about it as 'things that happen in the life of not-quite-a-detective person' then it doesn't really matter. Don't watch it expecting nice coherent stories that all tie together. It is not.\r\nIt is not quite a detective story, since this season only just introduces the overarching theme of detective-ness. Instead, it is Sakurako-san and the boy, who goes around and solves the mysteries of dead bodies and the motivations of the living alike, from the sinister to themundane. Some are stronger and more interesting than others, but they're all executed pretty well in theory, and the mystery-solving flows nicely and is decently grounded.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the strong point, I feel. The main duo have a unique sort of partnership going on. Like Sherlock and Watson, except she is less of an insufferable weirdo and merely eccentric with her own way of thinking, with the boy to counteract her childish traits. It is witty, convincing, and clever in its own little way. That is what makes this an enjoyable watch regardless",

            "content": "Sakurako-san no Ashimoto ni wa Shitai ga Umatteiru is a slice-of-life mystery show based off of a light novel by the same name. It is an episodic series showcasing individual smaller mysteries that eventually led into one bigger mystery, sort of.  With all of the hype that I initially heard about the light novel, I had high hopes for this show and was unfortunately disappointed. \r\nStory: 5/10\r\nI was really looking for this show to be next great mystery anime but at the end, I found myself feeling let down. The story starts off with Sakurako-san an Osteologist whose job and life passion is findingand reassembling the bones of diseased animals and yes, humans. Each show follows a similar pattern. Sakurako and her young assistant Shoutaoru, find themselves in a circumstance where they find bones of the diseased which then opens up a mystery that Sakurako must solve. The whole show carries on this way with each episode, sometimes two episodes, focusing on a single mystery which is then resolved. Wash, rinse, repeat. For those who have seen the anime \"Gosick\" it follows a similar pattern to that show. I was really hoping that this show would delve into one major mystery the would develop over the course of the show and it didn't. If you're looking for a mystery that's going to keep you at the edge of your seat, this isn't it. The mysteries were mediocre at best, they never really went anywhere and they weren't all that exciting. The first 3 episodes were promising, but things went downhill from there. Towards the end of the show the overlying mystery that connects all the smaller ones together finally comes into play, but it's rushed and never really comes to a full conclusion. So I guess what I'm trying to say is that overall the story was relatively underwhelming. There wasn't anything that made the show exceptionally good, but there wasn't anything that made it exceptionally bad either. It stands on middle ground. If anything I'm hoping for a second season to tie up the loose ends and questions that this show left me with. \\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: 8/10\\n\r\nThe animation in this show was the only factor that in my opinion that really stood out and was above average. The first thing I noticed upon watching the first episode was the beautiful use of color and general art style. So it was a solid job well done in that aspect.\\n\\n\r\n Sound: 5/10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was just average. Not much to say about it, there was nothing outstanding about it but it wasn't bad by any means.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10\\n\r\nUgh the characters were one of the biggest disappointments. Sakurako herself had the potential to be extremely interesting. I mean, her hobby is digging up bones and figuring out mysteries for heavens sake! But we never really learn that much about her. We get a tiny info dump towards the end about her past and how she met Shoutarou but never enough for me to say, \"I know this character.\" Speaking of Shoutarou he fell into the category of being the protagonist that was absolutely useless. We get practically no character development with him. He doesn't even really serve a purpose to the plot. And quite frankly, 9 times out of 10 he's kind of just in the way. Everything is solved by Sakurako and he just kind of hangs there along for the ride. He does have his own little shining moment at the end but for a main character, he should have had more of an important roll than he did. As for the rest of the characters, none of them were important enough for me to even talk about them. They were all one dimensional and never went anywhere. It really was a shame too because they had some good material but didn't really use it well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 6/10\\n\r\nDid I enjoy this anime? Yes, and no. As a whole I found the show entertaining enough to keep me engaged in the show. Some were better than others and some were pretty darn boring. But it kept my attention enough that made me want to at least see it through to the end.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall I give this show a 6/10. It was overall just an average run of the mill show. It wasn't bad or good. It was kind of just there. I think the show had great bones that the creators simply failed to use properly and to their full extent. The ending was left wide open for a second season and if they did make one I'd probably give it another chance. Definitely give this show a try. It's average but it still has a little something that does keep it interesting enough to watch.",

            "content": "The first thing I want to say is that it's too short. For an anime premise that involves a whodunnit, most of the crimes are solved within 1 episode.\r\nI stumbled upon this anime by accident, and being a fan of the CSI franchise, I was welcoming of such an anime. But boy was I wrong. The relative ease that the mysteries during the series get solved turned me off. The main character, like most main characters in anime is overpowered - she's basically a genius when it comes to solving mysteries. As a viewer, I am not taken on a journey or even allowed tocome up with my own hypothesis for who may have committed the crime, why or how they might have committed said crime; I've got to take Sakurako's hypothesis to be 100% accurate, and thanks to her being the love child of Sherlock Holmes and Partriot, in most cases she's not far off.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing about the mystery genre that drew me to other series like the CSI franchise is that there was a step by step process by which a crime was solved. With Sakurako-san, the anime takes shortcuts and jumps over a few steps to help solve the mystery, which I didn't like. At one stage she manages to solve a mystery in mere minutes!\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: Not much of a story for this, there are few arcs, but because the whole anime is only 12 episodes long, there isn't time for the development of these stories, it's over before it begins really. Some might call this anime episodic, in that each episode isn't related to the previous or upcoming one, except in 3 cases where the mystery is solved over 2 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: There are 6 characters that make an appearance in more than 1 episode. Obviously we have the 2 main characters (Sakurako and Shourtarou) then we've got an incompetent police officer, a teacher, a love interest and a granny.\\n\\n\r\nI have to say, these characters aren't developed or given time to develop. In most cases it would be fine, for example, yes you can have an incompetent police officer, but why not give him more screen time to develop? The only real person that got any development was Shourtarou's love interest - hell she even got her own filler episode, yes that's right - filler! Which by the way was a total waste of time and added nothing to the overall story; the anime is 12 episodes long and you waste it on the character development of a supporting character? Why?\\n\\n\r\nShoutarou is just a very dull character, and the last episode showing how the main characters met and their relationship is not that noteworthy either. There is no character development for him and he is mainly served as a conduit for us, the audience - explaining things we may or may not know. I can understand this, and I want to believe, if this series got a second season, this character troupe would have gone. However, I\u2019m pretty sure the series pretty much would pan out the same with or without him. That\u2019 s how much influence or input he has throughout the series - and it's kind of sad. Here you have a character you could've developed and made us understand him more, but they chose not to. Maybe they knew it wasn't going to a \"hit\" and therefore decided not to.\\n\\n\r\nNow the main character, Sakurako, and her bone fetish! My god! She literally is like a dog when it comes to looking at bones! And the fact that she\u2019s a genius doesn\u2019t help either, okay, if you were as old as Horatio Caine or Poirot, I could understand your boundless knowledge, but she\u2019s not. And yet she\u2019s a know it all. Really ticked me off with her know-it-all attitude and probably makes the anime as a whole suffer. Her superpowers end mysteries before they begin. Would've been much better served having Shoutarou find the dead bodies and solve mysteries - his lack of or limited knowledge would've a) allowed us the viewer to begin solving the mysteries with him as he tried to find clues and what not; b) would've been allowed character development and if by the end of 12 episodes manages to wrap up a mystery in 10 minutes we can understand why and c) probably would've been more enjoyable than having Sakurako as the main lead.\\n\\n\r\nThe others aren\u2019t really worth mentioning in more depth other than that they serve in some cases to help progress the story arc, but because of poor development overall, if they were erased from the anime it won\u2019t make a that much of a difference.\\n\\n\r\nART: One thing I must say it's vivid to say the least. Considering it's a dark subject matter, the colors provide a stark contrast to the plot of each episode. The colors do help in trying to show possibly accurate (I'm guessing) picture of human and animal bone structures/anatomy, other than that, I think they've made an error with colors for this anime, it's a dark subject matter (death, decay, dead bodies), so the colors should reflect that to set the mood.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give it a 6/10, it's not that bad I couldn't see it through (there were times I was considering it), but it's definitely not the best. Here's hoping that there are better mystery anime in the future.",
