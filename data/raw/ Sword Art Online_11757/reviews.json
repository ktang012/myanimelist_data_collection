            "content": "--The review contains minor spoilers--\r\nSince I've seen a plethora of scores of 10 for this show, I thought I'd write what I feel is a more realistic review for this show. Sword Art Online is more or less the equivalent of a fanfiction in it's writing and quality. Whether people want to overlook it or not is up to the individual, but I believe it fails at the fundamentals for writing a good story. This review will go into details as to my opinions on why I feel this way. \r\n1) Story - This is first major problem is the show. Let's start from thebeginning shall we. The first arc consists of 14 episodes. The first 2 episodes are honestly pretty good and set up the plot of the show that should follow. You're introduced to the main characters and it shows mmo style of play. I mean with 2 episodes that are amazing, surely what follows will be more of the adventures of the main characters and these mmo boss fights...right? Wrong. What follows are 5 completely irrelevant side character episodes and unnecessary terrible time skips that ruin any sense of a story the first 2 episodes set up. So due to some illogical reason, we're now down to 7 episodes to tell the rest of this story. Still doable right? RIGHT? Wrong again. The series wastes another 2 1/2 episodes on pointless filler garbage. So there you have it over half of first part of the story has nothing to do with the overall plot. Well what about the other episodes you ask? The remaining \"plot\" episodes are filled with deus ex machina in its purest form. Even the finale of the first season makes absolutely no sense. This isn't a fantasy world, it's a freaking video game, you can't have miracles here. So that concludes my issues with season 1, which the majority of SAO fans consider to be the best part....Yeh you heard me, the 2nd part is even worse.\\n\r\n       Without going into spoilers, the 2nd part of the series takes place in a different setting, with a mostly new cast aside from our main hero. This part of the series probably deserves the award for most unnecessary story in the history of anime. This arc is pretty much a mario game. Our hero must save the princess in the castle. Not really much to say about it. Oh yeh deus ex machina finale here too...oh and there's an incest subplot...for some reason. This concludes the plot section. I think I'm being pretty generous with a 4 here. \\n\\n\r\n2) Art - The art is fantastic. Colorful characters, bosses (the few we see), and settings are all here. It's easily worth an 8.\\n\\n\r\n3) Sound - Again fantastic. Nothing wrong with it at all. 8.\\n\\n\r\n4)Characters - Here we go...This is easily the worst part of the series. I'll separate the main characters and lump together the not so main characters.\\n\\n\r\nKirito/Kazuto - The main character of this show is the epitome of the current definition of a \"Gary Stu\". He has no personality whatsoever. He is good at everything he tries for no reason. He's an amazing player, an super sleuth, a ladies man, and a master hacker. You name it, he can do it. There's no reason given for this other than he's just that good. Girls all love him, guys want to be him, and villains are jealous of him. He also solos MMO boss fights...yeh wrap your head around that one. Side note - I often see people claim they love this show because they're hardcore gamers. I have to say as an avid gamer myself I find this show to be insulting. Unless you've hacked or cheated , I don't understand why you're content with a character who does. Side note over. \\n\\n\r\nAsuna - The main female lead/most blatant waifu  character ever. Asuna is introduced as a strong player who can stand on her own with Kirito, that is for the first couple episodes. Once she reappears she barely does anything other than cook for Kirito. That's right, her ass stays in the kitchen, while Kirito does all the important stuff. In part 2 she does absolutely nothing...seriously. She again has no original personality...textbook Tsundere. \\n\\n\r\nYui - This character is terrible in all senses of the word. She's walking deus ex machina, nothing more. This character should be hated by any gamer, since she's a cheat device, who adds nothing to the story. \\n\\n\r\nVillains (minor spoilers) - There are 2 major villains in this series and they're both terrible. The first one forgets his motives for doing everything in part 1 and the part 2 one is so comically evil he can't even be taken seriously. \\n\\n\r\nOther Characters/ Who the hell cares - The female characters all want to have sex with Kirito and have no personality past this. The male characters don't get to do anything because Kirito hogs the show from everyone. That's really all there is to say about that.\\n\\n\r\nSuguha - This is Kirito's sister. She honestly has layers and was a plus to the show in my opinion. I don't know why she's in this show, she doesn't belong in it...\\n\\n\r\nSo yeh, Gary Stu and Waifu - these characters are pathetic (1).\\n\\n\r\n5) Enjoyment - Needless to say I didn't enjoy it. Poor show (3)\\n\\n\r\n6) Overall - This show has so many fans, and I really don't know why. Its plot is rushed and terrible. Its characters so flat, it's almost funny...almost. Its romance is highly misogynistic and terribly developed. I felt insulted watching this, and don't understand how any could like this show. Even Gamers.",

            "content": "I don't really want to go into too much depth, but I'd like to give an overview of the series and give my opinions it. If you haven't noticed yet there are many negative reviews out there for this anime, and while many of them bring up some pretty fair points, I think some people are being a bit too harsh on it. Let me explain. \r\nYes it's a popular anime, yes it has flaws, no it's not perfect, but at the very least in my opinion it is enjoyable. The pacing is off, the beginning particularly feels rushed, there were moments where I thoughtI skipped an episode because of the time skips which made it difficult to really connect with any of the characters in the beginning, and there were some less than stellar instances where it felt like the anime was trying to make me care but failing hard. \\n\\n\r\nSome characters felt to be completely forgotten throughout most of this series too. For example in the beginning we are introduced to a character named Klein who is quickly pushed aside after the first episode and barely seen again and doesn't really make much of an impact at all on the story later on. This seems to happen a lot throughout this series where there might be some emotional moments where a character dies, or something dramatic happens but there is really no emotional impact from it, and the main character seems to not really care that much about it or it doesn't really effect anything significantly.\\n\\n\r\nI really felt this series shined from around episodes 4-13 and I wish they would have kept with that pace instead of rushing an ending midway and throwing something new at us. The second half just felt completely unnecessary and forced. \\n\\n\r\nPushing the negative aside, I found the overall theme and atmosphere of the series to be great, and being an avid lover the MMORPG genre obviously a lot of things in this series appealed to me. I really enjoyed the idea of being stuck in a game that was impossible to escape from without winning and having real consequences, it really made everything much more dramatic and meaningful in the story. Sadly this quickly goes away midway through the plot. \\n\\n\r\nIf I had to pick two of the best things this anime did well for me it would probably be the animation and soundtrack. They both were really well done, and honestly without them being as good as they were this series would have gotten a much lower score from me, and when I say I really enjoyed the soundtrack I mean that I loved it, it was superb. \\n\\n\r\nI think what it really comes down was just the fact that I enjoyed watching it. I can look at the flaws and pick the anime apart pretty easily, but those flaws never really stopped me from enjoying this anime.I really do feel though that it had a lot of potential to be a top tier series, it just made far too many mistakes. Looking at it objectively I simply cannot give this anime higher than a 7. It was good because I found it to be enjoyable, but it wasn't great or amazing. \\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day I watch anime because I want something that will entertain me and keep me interested, and I feel that Sword Art Online did a good job at accomplishing that. \\n",

            "content": "Once upon a time, in a land far away, there lived a brave young boy. He was the best swordsman in the land and the manliest man of all. He overcame countless trials with little effort and won the hearts of many fair maidens.\r\nYes, it's time for Sword Art Online, the origin of many angry rants. \r\nThe premise doesn't sound too bad. Ten thousand players of a virtual MMO are trapped in the game and forced to complete it to escape, except that death in the game leads to death in real life. Just think about it: this could be a tragic story of strugglewhere death is behind every corner. A story of sacrifice and despair. A story of alliances and betrayal. A story of the struggle to retain humanity in front of impossible conditions. \\n\\n\r\n...But why have any of that when you can have romance and harem?\\n\\n\r\nThat's right; the survival game is just for show. Don't expect deep interpersonal or political conflict. Don't expect psychology or moral dilemmas. Don't expect tactics or mind games. Actually, don't expect witty dialogue of any kind.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that is the biggest problem with this show. It is bankrupt in substance. It's mostly just uninspired romance and harem, with a bit of action here and there. There isn't much thinking involved. A few plot holes I could forgive, but if the show isn't about anything worthwhile, there isn't much to do. What makes this problem all the more apparent is that the premise promises something entirely different than what it delivers. The show has thrown its hands up in the air and said, \"We don't care.\" So why should the viewer? \\n\\n\r\nIt doesn't help that the show has grown infamous for glorifying its protagonist, who in the eyes of many has become the epitome of a Gary Stu. He can defeat anything, he can solve any problem, and he gets all the girls. It's almost like this show was meant to be a propaganda piece in his favor.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3\\n\\n\r\nThe first two episodes are decent, building up the premise. We are introduced to the protagonist Kirito and the concept of the death game. Soon enough, we are told that a month has passed and two thousand players have died offscreen. ...Wait, not even a short montage or anything? Apparently not. Anyway, these two episodes are pretty much the only decent ones, so savor them while you can.\\n\\n\r\nThe third episode begins to show more serious problems. We are supposed to form an emotional bond to new characters in a few minutes, and we have to go through over-the-top angst over irrational actions. But there is also optimism in the air; of course we can revive someone whose brain has been fried, right?\\n\\n\r\nWhat follows is an abrupt leap to harem and romance antics. The next few episodes are about various girls suddenly falling for Kirito, often the same day they met him. This typically involves uncontrollable blushing, fanservice, and people acting Tsundere. You probably get the picture. It doesn't help that many of these episodes have a very filler-esque feel to them. The main plot \u2012 if you can call it such at this point \u2012 takes a backseat in favor of these random new girls. \\n\\n\r\nThe girl called Asuna, who quickly becomes the token love interest for Kirito, has at least met him before, but there is still very little buildup to their relationship. Unless it took place offscreen. You see, another thing that becomes very noticeable is the pacing. There have been timeskips of months between episodes. This wouldn't be a problem if these snapshots contained all the events that were critical to the story, but it's obvious that the author has picked rather boring events out of all the possibilities. Why is it that thousands of people dying is covered in a few lines, while we have to sit through hours and hours of romance and harem? I hate to be beating a dead horse here, but it's unavoidable because it comes up again in just about every episode.\\n\\n\r\nBy now, it has also become obvious to the viewer that Kirito is invincible to the point of tedium. He has a level higher than anyone, the best equipment, and a seemingly endless pool of abilities, but most importantly he always wins. There is sometimes false tension, sure, but you know he will survive anyway. You can only stomach so many clutch survivals before you start rolling your eyes.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the story arc involves Kirito and Asuna hanging out in the countryside to spend their honeymoon. They even adopt a daughter to portray a typical happy family. The problem is that their relationship is really not that interesting. But \"dem feels\"! Nah, sorry. I have a heart of stone. \\n\\n\r\nThis is followed by a sudden confrontation with the main villain, which Kirito wins because the power of love conquers all. And by that I mean the power of love conquers the programming of the game. Well, okay, maybe there was some \"power of love\" clause in the code somewhere. It wouldn't surprise me at this point.\\n\\n\r\nPredictably enough, melodrama ensues. Tears, promises of love, etc. You can probably imagine. At least now we're done with this show, right?\\n\\n\\n\r\nNo, think again, that was only the good part. There are actually 11 more episodes left, and the journey takes us further downhill. We enter another game, this time without the death aspect. Before we get to the plot itself, even at a glance this idea brings up a few problems.\\n\\n\r\nThe harsh reality hits you faster than you can say \"cashcow.\" This second arc feels completely unnecessary. It has been tied into the original story with an overly convenient plot device for no apparent purpose other than stretching it further. At least know to quit while you're ahead. But no, they just had to drag this show through the mud to rip apart any shred of dignity it had left.\\n\\n\r\nIt doesn't help that there is no death anymore. While this makes the slice-of-life content more fitting, it also removes the established selling point of the show. The change is too abrupt, and the difference in tone is too jarring. If you want to make a slice-of-life of ordinary MMO players, do it from the start. \\n\\n\r\nNow, for the plot itself, and it isn't pretty. We go straight to a Mario game, by which I mean saving a damsel in distress trapped in a cage. And that isn't a metaphor; she is quite literally trapped in a cage. Add tentacles and incest to the plot, and you have a winning combination. The incest aspect is provided by Kirito's sister Suguha, who also provides additional fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nAt least now the pacing is less erratic and there is seemingly less development taking place offscreen. It's just too bad that there is also very little meaningful taking place onscreen. There are some new characters and even an ingame war going on, but it's all so irrelevant to the main story that it's hard to maintain interest. \\n\\n\r\nLong story short, Kirito beats the second villain with the help of more deus ex machinas. There are also more tears, promises of love, etc.\\n\\n\r\nSo now we're done, right? For now, yes, but there's still season 2 to look forward to. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSetting:\\n\\n\r\nThis is technically part of the story category, but I really think it deserves its own section here. You see, the very foundations of the setting make no sense. People in Sword Art Online are too often acting like they are in a normal game, not in a life-and-death scenario.\\n\\n\r\nFor instance, why is there so much resentment towards beta testers who have greater knowledge of the game? This isn't a competition; the faster someone beats the game, the faster everyone gets out. And, similarly, why are beta testers reluctant to share information? Are they so worried about other people using their newfound abilities to kill them for no reason? Look, you can't have both a casual slice-of-life of MMO players and a grim death game at the same time. Pick one. \\n\\n\r\nThis casual attitude becomes more pronounced later on when it becomes obvious people are wasting tons of time with unproductive quests, romance, and just hanging around. Kirito himself spends time on seemingly useless sidequests, and Asuna spends time cooking for him. Come to think of it, why has Asuna wasted points on a useless skill like cooking in the first place? Are these people even trying?\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnd why are so many players dying when towns are safe zones? Are they stupidly rushing into high-level dungeons? I suppose so. You see, for a grim death game it sure is hard to die in SAO. Bosses won't respawn, so everyone can advance forward, even weak players. Going from town to town is also easy enough with teleport crystals. Well, okay, there is that problem of challenging people to a duel while asleep, but that can't take out so many. \\n\\n\r\nThere is no lack of critical resources because you can hang out in the safety of towns indefinitely. Sure, exp and money are limited because the regeneration of monsters is limited, which is strange game design itself, but they aren't necessary if you stay in town. At least, the show never implies that they are necessary. Oh, and for the record, I'm treating the show as self-contained and ignoring the source material. \\n\\n\r\nSo why do they die? I'd put my money on rushing stupidly into dungeons because we get to see one notable example.\\n\\n\r\nLet's imagine you found yourself in the following situation. Before you and your guild are about to enter a high-level dungeon, you learn that one of them lied about his level. Knowing this, you realize you are underleveled and likely to end up dead, while avoiding death and warning the others would be as simple as staying in town.\\n\\n\r\nWhat would you do? Would you\\n\r\na) Record a message in advance, knowing that you wouldn't last long, or\\n\r\nb) Stay in town so that you wouldn't get killed in the first place?\\n\\n\r\nA tricky one, I admit.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWe are also introduced to groups of player killers. Sounds good until you realize this isn't a normal game. At least, I thought it wasn't, but it looks like some people didn't get the memo. In a situation like SAO, there should be no reason for these killings. This isn't Danganronpa, where the main point of the premise is that you can only escape by killing someone. This is a game where it makes the most sense to team up and beat the game. There is no prisoner's dilemma; cooperation is the best plan and any sensible person would go for it. \\n\\n\r\nIf you kill someone here, you only get some money and equipment. While it may help you beat the game a little faster, odds are that it will only hurt your chances of survival overall. Just off the top of my head, a few reasons: \\n\r\n1) If people start killing each other, it obviously increases the risk of dying yourself, both in retaliation and spontaneously.\\n\r\n2) Killing people reduces manpower needed for beating the game, and the distrust that follows will make it even slower. You could only kill useless low-level players, but they probably don't have much money or good equipment to begin with. \\n\r\n3) There is the chance that you will land murder charges if you escape from the game and officials find out.\\n\\n\r\nActually, does the equipment even help that much? Kirito seemingly uses the same equipment for long periods of time, yet he is practically invincible. On the other hand, he does say that equipment can be worth many levels, so did he get the best stuff for himself so fast? Is it strange game design or cheat codes? It's anyone's guess.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, if you have little interest in beating the game, killing other players makes more sense, if only a little. I suppose getting more money can help you obtain some luxury items, but is it worth the risk? The implied reason is that they are killing people for laughs, but why did so many murderous psychopaths decide to log into this MMO on its opening day? Is this some kind of stab at gamers, saying that they are unable to distinguish between real violence and fake violence? Maybe, or the author forgot that this isn't a normal MMO. Again.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo is it a legit plan to stay in the virtual world for the rest of your life and give up on getting back to the real world? If so, it would explain a lot. While the range of pastimes in there is smaller than in the real world, maybe there is enough for some people. \\n\\n\r\nThe choice between staying in relative happiness in a virtual world and risking your life returning to the real world could have been an interesting one. Unfortunately, their bodies are deteriorating in real life, which makes the choice very one-sided. For some reason, Asuna has to point this out to Kirito because apparently the state of his real-world body had never occurred to him over the course of two years. Yeah, good job, Kirito, you sure were fast on the uptake. Lying down on the grass and having a carefree nap doesn't sound so smart anymore, eh? \\n\\n\\n\r\nFinally, why are virtual MMOs still legal after the SAO incident? Sure, the new hardware is supposedly safer, but the previous death trap must have equally passed through \"strict\" government examination, so who in their right mind would trust them? And even if we assume it is safe, since when has people's hysteria hinged on facts? People fear new technology even when it's harmless, let alone when a massive incident like this happens. There would be mass protests in the streets in favor of banning them.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2\\n\\n\r\nYou may have noticed that I have only mentioned three characters by name so far. For some other show, this might be because the cast is so vast that there is no time to go through them all, but here it's rather that there are very few characters worth mentioning. Kirito, and by extension Asuna and Suguha who are defined by Kirito's character, hog practically all of the screentime. \\n\\n\r\nEveryone else gets thrown under the bus. Girls only exist to fall in love with Kirito, and males only exist to be inferior to him. The villains in particular only exist as fodder to the guy.\\n\\n\\n\r\nKirito:\\n\\n\r\nI have barely touched on Kirito's personality. Well, blame the show, not me; it should at least be willing to meet me halfway. We know very little about him, other than being invincible and inexplicably good with the ladies. Essentially, he is the manliest man on the planet.\\n\\n\r\nThat's pretty much all he is. Even his dialogue ends up pretty bland. There are no witty insights, no clever jokes, no skillful word games. Much of his dialogue consists of saying that the world is a virtual one, explaining game mechanics, wishing to save everyone, or loving someone forever. The sort of stuff you'd expect from a cardboard cutout hero in a situation like this. \\n\\n\r\nIt can be a facepalm-worthy experience to witness girl after girl falling for Kirito like nothing, often the same day they met him. The show endlessly drills into the viewer that he is the sexiest man alive... for some reason. I get that rescuing people can give you points in their eyes, but come on now. I can only assume there is a hidden manliness stat and his black jacket comes with a +999 boost.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as his invincibility goes, the win streak by itself isn't the biggest problem. The problem is that he always wins through brute strength. That is to say, his character skills and stats. There are no tactics worth mentioning, no psychology, no politics, no thinking whatsoever. He will just go out there and pull off his generic action hero stunts. Sure, developing those skills and stats may have required some tactical thinking. Maybe he has optimized his skill tree or has amazing grinding strats. In theory. We see no hints of it. It all happened offscreen and offscreen doesn't count. I'm sorry, it just doesn't. \\n\\n\r\nTo add insult to injury, some of Kirito's abilities are completely forgotten later on. I'm sure that health recovery thing would have come in handy any number of times. And when even his skills and stats aren't enough, he is saved by plot armor at the last second.\\n\\n\r\nIt's also a mockery of MMOs in the sense that Kirito is able to solo raid bosses. And he is able to attain a level higher than anyone despite playing solo, supposedly because he doesn't have to split the exp. His most unique ability is revealed to be... *drumroll* dual-wielding, which nobody else is allowed to do in this game. This doesn't sound like any MMO I know of, or was the idea to portray a player with god-mode cheats on?\\n\\n\r\nI'm seriously thinking that the show would have been a lot more tolerable if Kirito alone had been replaced by one of the side characters. It still wouldn't have been a masterpiece or anything, but at least the Gary Stu accusations could have been avoided.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAsuna:\\n\\n\r\nShe is about as bland in personality as Kirito. She is also portrayed as fairly powerful for no substantial reason but of course nothing compared to him. As time passes, her most notable trait becomes being a textbook Tsundere.\\n\\n\r\n...Well, that was fast. Moving on.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSuguha:\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned earlier, her main role is providing fanservice and a tacked-on incest subplot. It's simply another element thrown into the plot for cheap shock value, if anyone is still shocked by incest in anime nowadays.\\n\\n\\n\r\nVillain #1:\\n\\n\r\nThe first villain barely appears, and his motivation for trapping the players is vague, to say the least. He basically did it out of personal interest. He wanted to create a virtual world where death has meaning like in the real one, but as for why he was interested in the idea, he forgot. Err, alright then. Moving on.\\n\\n\\n\r\nVillain #2:\\n\\n\r\nThe second villain is pathetic and a disgrace to antagonists everywhere, coming across as a cartoon villain who does evil things for the sake of being evil. The conflict here is portrayed as completely black-and-white, just in case someone had sympathy for the guy, as unlikely as that is. \\n\\n\r\nHis main focus is essentially raping a comatose girl. And that is over obtaining tons of cash, presumably in the millions. If he had left the girl alone, he probably would have got away with it, so for all intents and purposes, he chose raping a girl over millions in cash. Talk about priorities. \\n\\n\r\nCome to think of it, it's already ridiculous that the family of the comatose girl is planning to have her marry the guy. I mean, she is in a coma. As in unconscious, unable to state her own intentions, etc. Where are child protective services when you need them? Thankfully, the law disagrees, so they can't apply for an official marriage. Instead, he'll be adopted by her family as their son in spirit... Wait, what? \\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, his sheer incompetence is mindboggling. He openly explains his evil plans and his security is practically at Dr. Evil level, up to entering a secret keycode in plain sight so that the prisoner can see. Thankfully the government and his company are equally incompetent and are not monitoring his research group closely despite its reliance on infamous technology used in SAO. Are these the same people who deemed the new tech safe? If so, I'd like a second opinion. I wouldn't trust these people to operate Angry Birds, let alone a virtual MMO with potential health risks. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\\n\r\nSo this is where the money went.

            "content": "Once in a while, there comes along a title (be it movie, book or anime) that takes the audience by storm, sweeping numerous off their feat, leaving several with a bad aftertaste in their mouth and making a few pass the work off  as \u2018average\u2019 or \u2018mediocre\u2019. Online communities, forums, chat rooms and every other nook and corner of the internet known to the man turn into arenas of debates, discussions, fanboyism/fangirlism and flaming. It\u2019s apparent that when something is popular, it doesn\u2019t always get to bath in praises. With the acclaim, comes a sheer amount of criticisms. Also, it goes without saying thatpopularity doesn\u2019t necessarily equate to quality. \\n\\n\r\nSword Art Online, abbreviated as SAO from this point on, is no exception.   \\n\\n\r\nSAO, the anime adaptation of a series of light novels of the same name by Kawahara Reki, has been the much talked about show of the Summer and Fall 2012 seasons, and taking into consideration the incredible hype surrounding it with reviews of mixed sorts, it\u2019s likely to stay that way for quite some time. Keeping in mind the vogue of MMORPGs and the demand for something \u2018captivating\u2019, the team behind SAO attempts to bring an enticing work to the table by executing the intriguing premise of \u2018players trapped in a VRMMORPG where death equates to death in real life and the only way out is to clear the game\u2019. Unfortunately, SAO fails at many levels which is a shame because when the anime kicked off with the highly anticipated first episode, all seemed well and it gave the vibes of something truly worth spending your time on but then it does a flip and from this point, things go awry. And here we have it\u2014 one of the most controversial anime of the recent years. \\n\\n\r\nBefore proceeding with the review, let\u2019s get one thing straight. I have not read the original source material\u2014 the light novels, that is. Hence, I\u2019m not going to draw any comparison between that and the anime. With that out of the way, let\u2019s keep the ball rolling.  \\n\\n\r\nSAO on the surface has a fairly interesting premise, no doubt, and it\u2019s executed well to some extent or so did it initially seem. The very idea of a large number of people logged into a VRMMORPG with the intention of embarking on a virtual reality adventure but only to be struck with utter horror as they\u2019re faced with the shocking truth of the game has been put into effect quite satisfactorily in the first episode. It\u2019s pretty much what I\u2019d call an excellent start. However, SAO effortlessly manages to send all my expectations and enthusiasm down the drain for it takes the show only an episode or two to reveal its true colours followed by the disappointment it has in store.  \\n\\n\r\nSo, what goes wrong? Well, many things.  \\n\\n\r\nFollowing the Great Beginning, the first arc decides to take a detour and invests on a few episodes dealing with side stories in which our protagonist Kirito gets acquainted with one girl per episode and ends up rescuing her from a jam. This is precisely why I like referring to this bunch of side stories as \u2018episodic harem\u2019 wherein the primary heroine of the story and Kirito\u2019s love interest Asuna is assumed to be constant and the other girls are variables. Now this isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. However, these side stories have very little to nothing to contribute to the series as a whole. Admittedly, they equip the viewers with some clever, little details here and there regarding how the game world works but they hardly have any bearing to the overall plot. The primary goal of these filler-like episodes appears to be that of giving our hero clad in black an opportunity to flaunt how much of a chick magnet he is and how he has it all that takes to be the coolest dude in this world made up of zillions of pixels. To boot, the characters (read: cute chicks) that appear in these episodes have absolutely no substantial role to play in the story later on. \u2018Side\u2019 characters indeed. And SAO knows how to effectively sideline them. \\n\\n\r\nWhen the arc finally gets itself back on track, it\u2019s only natural to hope that the show will now have something worthwhile to deliver. However, that isn\u2019t the case. If anything, some severe cracks begin to appear as very soon the focus of SAO is the romance between the two leads which is, in one word, cheesy. At this point, opinions are divided. The romance aspect, for some, can be appealing while for others, it can be a major turn off especially if they don\u2019t like the characters involved. It all comes down to personal preference. However, personal preferences aren\u2019t a convincing excuse by any means to overlook the fact that the story, world building and everything else take a backseat for the sake of allowing the two leads to be lovey-dovey in the backdrop of gorgeous sceneries. When the arc does manage to divert its focus on to some \u2018serious business\u2019, things look good for a while but with a rather unimpressive ending, the first arc concludes on a pretty bad note in my book.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd then begins the second arc which, to be blunt, is a letdown again. \\n\\n\r\nThe second arc or the ALO arc is set within ALfheim Online, a VRMMORPG successor to SAO. Kirito logs in with a mission to rescue his wife (Asuna, duh) from the clutches of an archetypical antagonist who is a disgrace to all the villains in fiction we have come across so far. This arc showcases some really eye candy visuals but that\u2019s pretty much its only redeeming point. It doesn\u2019t have anything much going on except for a few climactic action sequences now and then with intense battle music playing in the background that last only for a while. Not to mention, there\u2019s another girl added to Kirito\u2019s harem.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd then the hilarity ensues.  \\n\\n\r\nThe manner in which ALO is brought to a close is appalling to say the least and at the same laughable because it doesn\u2019t hesitate to use the much notorious plot device dues ex machina, ruining whatever hopes there were for the final confrontation with the villain. The poor conclusion could be excused if it was handled more cleverly and convincingly but a blatant ass pull is by no means satisfactory. If anything, it only proves that the writer faced a dead end and was unable to think of anything better and creative, and expected the audience to swallow down whatever he could come up with, no matter how downright stupid it is.  \\n\\n\r\nAmong all the other things, the most easily noticeable flaw without a doubt is the execution of the plot itself which is all over the place. It doesn\u2019t take a genius to figure out after a couple of episodes that SAO suffers from poor pacing and inconsistency. It appears to be highly indecisive as to what exactly it wants to do and how to get it done. This is mostly evident in the first arc which is incredibly rushed at many parts. There\u2019re timeskips and the next thing you realize is that the characters have already cleared quite a lot of floors while keeping us, the viewers, in the dark. This makes the plot disjointed, prevents any sort of correlation to the win-or-die situation that the characters have been put into and gives everything the feel of it being nothing more than a piece of cake. The struggle for survival and a sense of urgency are hardly felt even though the lives of the characters have been said to be literally at stake. The episodes dealing exclusively with the lead couple taking some time off for a \u2018vacation\u2019 and subsequently ending up building a virtual family can further make one wonder: Why are they so carefree when they\u2019re supposed to chalk out plans to beat the game and make a quick escape? To put it in other words, the arc has a tendency to go off track. It lays down for itself one thing but ends up doing something else altogether. It\u2019s uncertain as to whether to make itself come across as a story of survival set within a VRMMORPG or as a fluffy love story. In due course, it decides to juggle with both but doesn\u2019t get either of them rightly done. Not to mention, when the situation demands it and the writer goes out of any creative ideas to move the story forward, the characters\u2019 actions are made to contradict the established game mechanics and the only reasoning that\u2019s provided for such miracles is \u2018where there\u2019s a will, there\u2019s a way, and there\u2019re times when true love and determination can overcome any obstacle in the game\u2019.  \\n\\n\r\nNow, for those who look for substance in any given story, it\u2019s almost a fact that no amount of fanservice, eye candies, self-insertion or guilty pleasure factors can possibly compensate for a substandard storytelling. Yet that\u2019s what SAO tries to do. It brings in all the aforementioned elements to sugarcoat its sloppy writing. On the whole, there\u2019re no sincere efforts made to incorporate details that would contribute in some way or the other to world building or characterization whatsoever.  \\n\\n\r\nWhile the poor quality of the writing is the key factor, the other aspect that contributes considerably to the mediocrity of the show is the characterization. Simply put, SAO\u2019s characters are bland. Essentially, the show has its focus on only two characters: Kirito and Asuna. The others are just there; mere devices to move the story forward. And a few have nothing to contribute to the plot at all. For instance, the ones featuring in the side stories. \\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s talk about the protagonist Kirito first.  \\n\\n\r\nAn unsocial, reserved yet headstrong player who knows how to get things done his way and is determined to beat the game. That\u2019s basically how Kirito is portrayed in the beginning. At this point, he seems like a good riddance from the generic wimpy male leads that have become so much of a commonplace in anime. A proficient main character who knows how to deal with things is something refreshing to witness once in a while. Unfortunately, the impressions didn\u2019t last for long. In desperate attempts to make his character more \u2018appealing\u2019, Kirito is depicted as a \u2018perfect\u2019 being which leaves his character with little plausibility and much insipidity. \\n\r\nHe\u2019s a guy with a heart of gold. \\n\r\nHe has an \u2018ideal\u2019 girlfriend/wife.\\n\r\nHe\u2019s admired by those around him. \\n\r\nHe can \u2018unintentionally\u2019 make every other woman adore him, romantically or otherwise.  \\n\\n\r\nThus, he serves as a mere self-insert character for wish-fulfilment and at the end of the day, there\u2019s nothing \u2018individualistic\u2019 about him. Gary stu is probably what describes his character the best, and if paired with the Mary sue of the show, we get a lead couple that seems to have been cut out straight from a tacky romance fanfiction.  \\n\\n\r\nYes, when I mentioned \u2018Mary sue\u2019, I was referring to Asuna. \\n\\n\r\nAsuna as the female lead is as stereotyped as they come. Much like Kirito, her character is heavily idealized. She\u2019s pretty, popular, kind, caring and every other man wants to have a piece of her. Oh, and did I mention her cooking skills that level up with each passing day? After all, her foremost duty is to cook for Kirito and show how much she cares for him. While initially she\u2019s portrayed as a strong, independent female player with a tsundere-ish attitude, it doesn\u2019t take her long to make a transition from that to a deplorable damsel in distress, requiring her knight in black robe to come to her rescue whenever she\u2019s in a bind. Kirito fighting her guild leader to earn her some time for honeymooning is laughable to say the least. It soon becomes apparent that she doesn\u2019t have much of a role other than serving as the love interest of the protagonist and being the object of fanservice now and then which might be successful in pleasing the male audience somehow but that alone can\u2019t make up for her badly written character. In fact, the other female character the show cares to put the spotlight on also ends up becoming the target of fanservice but doesn\u2019t have anything else going on for herself.  \\n\\n\r\nIf you haven\u2019t guessed it already, I\u2019m talking about Kirito\u2019s beloved imouto. \\n\\n\r\nThroughout the first arc, the writer must have had been itching to include a love triangle in the story but couldn\u2019t find a potential candidate to get the job done. As the first arc comes to a closure and the second arc begins, he grabs the opportunity, puts Asuna behind the bars (so that she\u2019s not an interference in what he\u2019s attempting to do) and introduces Suguha, Kirito\u2019s cousin sister. The sole purpose of creating her character, it appears, is to make way for a generic love triangle and melodrama. Suguha loves her cousin but can\u2019t do anything about it because he loves Asuna. That\u2019s the bitter truth. Hence, she looks up to a certain someone she happens to befriend within ALO and hopes that he\u2019d be able to sooth her aching heart. However, she gets trolled\u2026 badly. This, in turn, leads to more drama that\u2019s somehow supposed to be heart wrenching but it isn\u2019t.  \\n\\n\r\nThe remaining cast consists of two antagonists, both failing to make any sort of impression though the one making his debut in the second arc can be a good comic relief at times, and a bunch of side characters that wouldn\u2019t have had made any difference even if they hadn\u2019t existed. The bottom line is, the characters of SAO are a half-baked lot devoid of any depth or development. They could\u2019ve perhaps turned out to be interesting if they were more fleshed out but who cares about that as long as they appeal to the intended target audience?  \\n\\n\r\nOnto the technical aspects now.  \\n\\n\r\nIn the department of visuals, A-1 Pictures does a pretty good job. Within the game, the vast tracts of greenery, the beautiful cities during the night, the castles\u2026 they\u2019re all a pleasure to behold. The animation is also well-handled for the most part. Initially I wasn\u2019t much pleased with the character designs but they gradually grew on me, and I personally find a few characters like Asuna, Heathcliff and Lisbeth to be very well designed.  \\n\\n\r\nThe music is composed by one of the most renowned composers in the anime industry, Yuki Kajiura. While the soundtracks aren\u2019t bad by any means, none of them stand out much except the one that plays during combat/intense scenes. In fact, that\u2019s the only track that can be heard playing most of the time in the entire show. A few other tracks, though they aptly fit the scenes they\u2019re played in, are easily forgettable. The same applies to the opening and ending themes. Nothing groundbreaking there. I\u2019m a fan of almost all of Kajiura\u2019s works and if compared to her previous works, SAO\u2019s music is lacklustre to say the least and so much so that it\u2019s hard to believe Kajiura is the composer to begin with. \\n\\n\r\nTo wrap up the review, SAO had the potential to be something good but that potential goes down the drain due to poorly executed plot and bland characterization. It starts off in a satisfactory manner but goes downhill thereafter. Nevertheless, it can be an entertaining ride if one keeps their expectations low and swallows down whatever it has to offer without questioning anything. One of the reasons why SAO has been a letdown is the anticipation the majority had for it prior to its airing but that\u2019s justified since the light novel series from which the anime is adapted is one of the most popular ones out there.  \\n\\n\r\n[Edited on March 20, 2017]",

            "content": "Sword Art Online, aka The Twilight Saga for Teenage Boys.\r\nIn the beginning, Sword Art Online (SAO) looked like it could have turned out to be the best show of the year, no exaggeration. The premise of being stuck and unable to log out of a virtual reality MMO with the condition that dying in the game means you die in real life and the only way out is to clear all 100 floors was set up extremely well in the first episode. The second episode continued this with the first boss fight, supported by well-done animation and Yuki Kajiura's amazing-as-always score. At this point, hopeswere high.\\n\\n\r\nBut it didn't last.\\n\\n\r\nThe following few episodes were side stories from the original novel that have little to do with the overall plot. On their own, none of these are all that bad, but together they become rather tedious and ridiculous, especially when you realize that the focus of each one is the main character, Kirito, befriending and helping a cute girl (despite the fact that the female playerbase is said to only be 10%), and in more than half the cases, said girl getting attached to Kirito in more than a \"friendly\" way. And these characters, if they appear later at all, never again play a significant role.\\n\\n\r\nThese episodes would have worked better if they'd been placed throughout the series between story arcs - though it later becomes apparent that this would not actually work - or released separately as OVAs or DVD specials. The best thing to be said about them is that they help to give the game world some more depth since they explain some game mechanics and show viewers how the various groups of players are going about playing the game, but the information is mostly superfluous and could have easily been given to us through the main story. Not that any of it ever gets used again anyway.\\n\\n\r\nThen the main story continues and things get...worse.\\n\\n\r\nIt's at this point that an idea starts developing that perhaps the writer of the novels merely had a good idea for a story but didn't know what to do with it past the premise. The above-mentioned side stories were included when they were because the show is being broadcast in chronological order; when the main story picks back up, it's been two years since the last main story episode. Bonds between characters have been formed off-screen and over the half the game has already been cleared.\\n\\n\r\nWhat a rip-off.\\n\\n\r\nBefore continuing with the story, let's look at the characters. We have our protagonist Kirito, a solo player who knows his way around the game fairly well as a result of having been a beta tester for the game. Okay, this is cool. We don't need 12 episodes of training to become the best in every show, a strong-from-the-start MC is fine. But that's not quite what Kirito is. Kirito is portrayed as essentially perfect in every way; he never loses a (fair) fight, he always has a solution, and all the chicks dig him. Basically, Kirito is a Gary Stu, a self-insert wish-fulfillment character with no true substance (have you heard of that before, anime fans?). He even gets a special ability not given to any other player just because he's that awesome.\\n\\n\r\nNow let's look at Asuna, the only other character the show actually cares about. She is initially portrayed as a strong, individual female who has abilities on par with the male characters. Again, this was good at first. But it quickly becomes clear that she only exists as otaku bait. She's extremely popular and beautiful and all the guys want her...but she only wants Kirito. And despite the fact that she is supposedly a strong player, she's treated more like a prize than a teammate; Kirito literally fights for her freedom from her guild more than once. Yeah, she can't even earn her own freedom for some vacation time after all the work she's been putting in for the past two years. Sexist much? No MMO guild leader would actually be this anal, but hey, we need to make Kirito look awesome somehow.\\n\\n\r\nAnd really, that's all Asuna is here for: to enhance Kirito's badass status. When he almost dies, she's there to cling to him and cry for him. When Kirito needs to look awesome, she's put in some kind of trouble and he gets her out of it. She also cooks for him because her cooking level is so high because hey, your waifu needs to cook for you, Kirito.\\n\\n\r\nTailor Twilight so that it appeals to boys instead of girls and send your awful fanfic to the printing press. Sword Art Online has been born.\\n\\n\r\nNo, I'm not joking. Screw action, screw plot, cue romance. SAO skips out on all the floor-clearing and boss-killing and decides to just have its main characters play house and do character development backwards. Nothing is believable about the relationship between these two characters. We see no real development between them since the show kind of just drops us into the middle of things after those useless side stories are over. And this is the focus for multiple episodes. Lots of cheesy, lovey-dovey dialogue, hand-holding, and sleeping is what we're fed. It's an otaku wish-fulfillment, folks; you're in a medieval world, you're the strongest person around, the cute girls all want you, and you don't have to work because magic (game mechanics) supplies everything.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and breast-groping. Can't forget the blatant fanservice!\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I praised the show for at first was that it seemed like an accurate portrayal of what a virtual reality MMO would actually be like. But, as usual, SAO managed to crap on itself. The whole \"beater\" concept, a combination of the words \"beta\" for beta testers and \"cheater,\" is laughably ridiculous and would never happen and obviously only exists to antagonize certain groups of players and give Kirito even more attention. We also see a group of players acting as an \"army\" of sorts going around forcing other players to pay taxes, even attacking an in-game daycare (LOL) in order to collect; this is dumb. Once again, a way to make Kirito and Asuna look like such sugoi people for helping out the needy children. Somewhere along the line the writer decided to make this a pseudo-medieval setting, taking what he wanted from the medieval era and what he wanted from MMO mechanics and not caring how they would make sense with each other. It's even written in the novel and alluded to in the anime that characters can have sex (but can't get pregnant, because that's no fun). Now that's taking cyber-sex to a whole new level. What would our wish-fulfillment world be without it?\\n\\n\r\nBut before too long we get to the climax of the first main arc, and after a couple miracles and deus ex machinas we can very clearly see that the author had no damn clue what he was going to do with his story after he had the premise down. The promise that was made to us has been broken and we, the viewers, are left with one of the most soulless shows to ever hit the airwaves. Any generic battle shounen at least gives us the action it promises and has better developed relationships and themes of friendship. Any generic harem at least knows it's dumb and only exists to appeal to that niche group of otaku who still enjoy it. SAO is a lie, a cheat, a traitor, and is worse than either of those. SAO wants you to believe it's good and smart, but it's so bad it doesn't even manage to achieve So Bad It's Good status. It's just terrible.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now we're at the start of a new arc. Things...don't look any better. Kirito has added a new member to his harem in the form of a busty little sister/cousin (emphasis on that bust), because we needed some imouto fetish-fuel in here. Our antagonist is about as generic and stereotypical as they come, but that kind of fits because our new plot is about as generic and stereotypical as they come.\\n\\n\r\nI've spent a lot of time on characters and plot without mentioning technical aspects because the technical aspects, no matter how good they are, really just won't change anything. They're there, and they're good; really, there's nothing wrong with them. Kajiura's music, when noticeable, is great and enhances the few good scenes the show has. The animation is also good. But neither is really amazing enough to be notable, so in the end, they just can't save a terrible piece of work.\\n\\n\r\nAnd Sword Art Online is a downright terrible piece of work.\\n\\n\r\nBreakdown:\\n\r\nStory - 2/10: Good premise, atrocious execution.\\n\r\nArt - 8/10: It looks nice.\\n\r\nSound - 7/10: Yuki Kajiura.\\n\r\nCharacter - 1/10: There are no characters in this anime.\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 3/10: It's fun to criticize.\\n\r\nOverall - 2/10.",

It has devout fans who think it's one of the greatest, haters who think it's trash, and a minority that just says \"hey guys, can't we all just have different opinions?\" I hate the first and last groups with a fiery passion. I feel like breaking down why I think it's awful, so I'm writing a review. Let\u2019s get into it, shall we?\r\nStory:\r\nThe premise was a somewhat generic one, and \u201ctrapped in a video game\u201d has been done numerous times before, but SAO seemed promising. And then the plot did everythingwrong. It utilizes time skips to avoid character development and many important events happen off screen and are never mentioned again or properly explained. Once Kirito was in a seemingly impossible to escape situation, but it just skipped to after he survived without ever explaining how he managed it. Because, I guess, that's not as important as filler episodes about Kirito resurrecting some irrelevant bitch's bird thingy. \\n\\n\r\nIt lacks any amount of tension due to the main character having invincible plot armor and LE EPIC DUBBLE SWORDZ. I'm confused by the point of the double swords. Why was that his special thing? No one else was capable of putting another sword in their other hand? I mean, Jesus, if you're going to give the main character an overpowered weapon at least be creative. The funny thing is that although dual wielding was supposed to be Kirito's unique ability and this idea was drilled into our minds time and time again, other characters are shown dual wielding on several occasions. They seriously put no effort into this series. \\n\\n\r\nThe worst aspect of the story was how rushed it was. The first half of the series was full of episodic filler episodes which did not develop the plot and mostly featured episodes about random women falling in love with the blank slate of a main and episodes centered on the uninspired romance between the two main characters. Because of this the episodes that were important to the plot were dealt with very quickly and almost glossed over in the grand scheme of things. \\n\\n\r\nDespite the supposed danger of the game, it seems like you would have to be a complete moron to get killed. Towns are safe, there are teleportation crystals, and boss fights were short and boring and easy. Besides, bosses don't respawn anyway. Then all of a sudden the arc came to an anticlimactic finish, illogically and out of nowhere. There was supposed to be 100 boss battles, but we're only shown a couple that are settled easily. But does SAO stop there? Nonono. It's not nearly bad enough yet.\\n\\n\r\nThe entire point of the series was an MMO where you couldn\u2019t escape and would die if you lost. While Kirito is, for all practical purposes, invincible anyway, an incident occurs that makes the MMO even less dangerous, effectively killing any kind of promise the original premise had. The second half features even more girls falling for our boring protagonist, a spindly 16 year old gamer inexplicably overpowering a grown man, netorare, kind of-incest, almost-tentacle rape, a world without logic, the degradation of women, and our wonderful protagonist defying all the rules of the game with THE ETERNAL POWER OF LOOOOOVE.\\n\r\n(dude, I don't think that's how the programming works)\\n\\n\r\nChock full with plot holes, contradictions, deus ex machina, and diaboli ex machina, and devoid of foreshadowing, originality, or subtlety, this is one of the, if not the, worst plots I have ever encountered in any medium. And I've read \"120 Days of Sodom.\"\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nGood scenery, but the character design was lacking. The characters were very generic looking and their armor and weapons weren't anything special. There were several atrocities as well. \\n\\n\r\nAll of the fairies looked stupid, in my humble opinion. Especially the scary butterfly man. There were a couple instances of obvious mistakes like characters that should be in the background of a fight that disappear then reappear after, but that's nitpicking compared to the real problems with this series.\\n\\n\r\nOne weird thing was that Kirito was apparently supposed to look different in the game than he was in real life, based on important un-spoilable plot elements, but he looks exactly the same.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nSame as the art. It's alright, but that means nothing if the series has no substance. Good sound is just icing on the cake and icing won't make this cake taste any less like shit. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nOh, boy. This is the worst part.\\n\r\nKirito: Kirito is a character who was designed as a blank slate so that losers could insert themselves into his place. He has no personality to speak of. He is the male Kristen Stewart of anime. His only unique trait or real aspect to his character is him being strong. Really. He's so strong people surrender to him without even fighting. He\u2019s pretty much perfect for  a shut-in loser who\u2019s addicted to video games. I mean, only a couple times in the series is he actually challenged because he is an all powerful 1337 b34t3r. Seriously, most of his enemies only hate him because they\u2019re jealous. \\n\\n\r\nWhat is the point of an action series where the protagonist cuts through all of his enemies with the greatest of ease? There was more than one occasion where he died, but did not die because plot armor. Kirito is too cool for the silly rules of (virtual) reality that apply to everyone besides him.\\n\\n\r\nAsuna: She's perfect as well. She's strong, beautiful, and most importantly, good at cooking. She falls in love with Kirito inexplicably and out of nowhere and they just have no chemistry. When you pair a Mary sue up with a blank slate/self-insertion you get a love story on the level of twilight.\\n\\n\r\nI feel like the writers were trying to make her a strong female character at first, but seeing as how well she fits the female gender role, how often she must be the damsel in distress, and all the shameless fanservice, I'd say the portrayal of her character was archetypal to the highest degree and somewhat misogynistic. Ok, very misogynistic. She\u2019s mostly here for Kirito to look cool. What kind of self-insert doesn\u2019t have a Mary sue girlfriend? \\n\\n\r\nSuguha: She's Kirito's sister-cousin thingy. She's clearly very stupid because she did not recognize Kirito even though he looks no different in the game than he does in real life. All I can say about her besides that is this: she was thrown in for extra fanservice, obligatory incest, (Why is this a thing in Japan? Is the birth rate issue that bad?) a half-assed and predictable love triangle, and for another girl to love Kirito because, hey, you can never have too many. She has no personality and she's annoying. She\u2019s pretty much here to emphasize Kirito\u2019s coolness.\\n\\n\r\nVillains: I don't remember these guys\u2019s names tbh. There was a MMO designer guy who was responsible for a bunch of people's deaths, but for some reason we're supposed to think is good in the end. There's also the butterfly guy. He was my favorite because he was so hilarious, but he was also my least favorite because he was the least threatening villain ever. There were also two purple tentacle guys. I don't really know who they are and I think they were just there to grope Asuna, but they were weird.\\n\\n\r\nAs a whole the villains either have unrealistic motives or no motives at all. With the original programmer guy they try to make a morally grey villain, but fail entirely. He is also there to make Kirito look cool, but for reasons that I cannot describe in a spoiler-free review. With butterfly man they make him too pathetic and unrealistically evil. He was made like this to contrast with Kirito and so, like everybody else in the series, he\u2019s just there to make Kirito look cool. And I don't know wtf to say about the purple tentacle guys. They were probably the best villains though. The desire to tentacle rape is certainly the most believable motive I encountered in this anime, especially seeing as most characters never even offered one. Although that is like saying that they are the undisputed champions of the Special Olympics, congrats to them anyways.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly there were a lot more antagonists, but these ones are the only ones that matter enough to me to write about. The others weren't memorable enough to criticize. They were all bad, let's just say that. \\n\\n\r\nEverybody else: Because nobody else matters. Hell, I just put in Suguha to be nice and it's not like the villains actually matter because Kirito is pretty much invincible. Shit, Asuna only matters because she pleases Kirito. If Asuna didn't make such boss sandwiches, she wouldn't even be relevant to the story.\\n\r\nThere are a couple recurring characters with no personality and no development, but they show up rarely and only to make Kirito look cool and/or fall in love with him. \\n\\n\r\nThere are several incidents where Kirito inexplicably befriends or makes acquaintance of characters devoid of personality who do nothing, but get killed. And then we're supposed to care about the death of these random characters. You can't just introduce random characters, kill them, and say \"ohhhh dey died isnt dat saaaad.\" You need development. \\n\\n\r\nEven worse is the thousands of unidentified characters that die early on in SAO. We're supposed to feel emotion about this, but any writer knows that reducing characters to mere numbers dehumanizes them thus removing all emotion from the equation. They probably skipped these scenes because they were incapable of making sympathetic and realistic character. This laziness and lack of ability foreshadowed the fate of the rest of the show's characters.\\n\\n\r\nDid they even try? Of course they didn't. They don't have to and people will love it anyway. ALL ABOARD THE HYPE TRAIN.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI'm going to be honest: The most enjoyment I got out of this anime was laughing at the \"serious\" scenes. When Kirito introduced Asuna, in real life, as \"lightning flash Asuna\" and talked about her guild and power level, I seriously cried from laughter. Actually every time Kirito cried so did I. Just not in the way I think I was supposed to. I spat out my iced tea when the butterfly guy was licking agirlwhowillnnotbenamedforthesakeofnospoilers's face. That was too much. Seriously, it stained my shirt. Did anybody actually enjoy that scene? Did anybody actually take that seriously? The answer: no. Or, at least, I really hope that\u2019s the answer. My God, I hope that\u2019s the answer. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the action aspect, I'm not sure how anybody would enjoy the action scenes, and I certainly did not. They were all too easy. There were a couple times when it tried to make it look like he was in trouble, but lo and behold, some miracle happened every time. Knowing how the fight will end is an unfortunate situation in plenty of anime, but those anime at least have more creative fight scenes and abilities or they are character oriented anyway. Even runescape has better and more interesting fights than this MMO. \\n\\n\r\nBesides the quality, there were quantity issues as well. This isn't really an action anime. The majority of the episodes were focused on Kirito saving Asuna from something, women falling in love with Kirito, or about Kirito and Asuna's boring relationship. I don't think there's a single episode that's \"action-packed.\" Seeing as we were supposed to get 100 boss fights, this is a problem and it would be a letdown, but after a hundred of those dreary fights I believe I would likely die of boredom. \\n\\n\r\nThe romance was just bad. There's much better romance out there and the characters had no chemistry. I'd prefer a romance with characters that are actually intriguing. Also, most anime focus on the build-up of the relationship a lot, but here it happens right away and there's no time to enjoy anything. This wouldn't be that bad if their relationship was interesting, but they don't have any serious arguments and are essentially the perfect couple. The only enjoyable developments in their relationship were the ones where Asuna was in danger. And by \"enjoyable developments\" I mean \"developments that made Kirito cry like a little girl.\" Those moments were still awful, but comparatively speaking, they were rather enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nThis is not an anime that I would recommend to anyone. I would not even recommend it to my worst enemy. That is cruelty of which I am not capable. It was atrocious, infuriating, corny, clich\u00e9, contrived, horrid, purple tentacled, pseudo-incestuous, borderline-misogynistic, vaguely misogynistic, completely misogynistic, plebeian, an affront to mankind, unintelligent, crafted by the devil, a war on art, used to torture terrorists, bourgeois, anti-intellectual, inbred, languid, shallow, self-insertionly, corny, the antithesis of Shakespeare, the apotheosis of awful fiction, blank, infantile, pathetic, vacuous, vapid, salacious, inane, imbecilic, an abortion, Stygian, sub-par, bland, poorly thought out, corny, loathsome, vomit-inducing, virulent, bile, poorly executed, infernal, eviscerating, flippant, an insult to its audience, cadaverific, philistine, lame, sad in all the wrong ways, funny in all the wrong ways, painful, paint-drying, boner-killing, wretched, impotent, generic, unemotional, repetitive, redundant, boring, and corny. I really really wish I hadn\u2019t watched it. If you\u2019re one of the people who told me it was a \u201cmust watch\u201d then fuck you. Not even funny. \\n",

            "content": "After examining forums, comments, and reviews on Sword Art Online, it doesn't take a genius to recognize that this anime adaptation is one of the most controversial, disputable TV Series of the year. Thus, it'll be understandable if you disagreed with me at some point in this review, but please take the time to actually read it before deciding \"oh, just another fan boy\" or \"gross, just another hater.\" Because, in my opinion, Sword Art Online doesn't deserve the amount of crap it gets or the amount of praises; essentially, it's mediocre.\r\nFirst and foremost, the Sword Art Online TV Series is an adaptation of thelight novels under the same name. People who have witnessed this pattern unfold before know the difficulties in the adaptation process. For those of you new to the community, when a studio announces an adaptation it usually means two things: fan service, and fillers. Sword Art Online is a perfect victim for the studios these days that desire the big bucks. What derived from a romantic, unique concept was transformed into an utter construction of unoriginality and clich\u00e9s. \\n\\n\r\nOther words, all the significant features residing in the original light novels were compacted down into seemingly unimportant bits and the wrong things got emphasized.\\n\\n\r\n= Story (3) =\\n\\n\r\nWhat the studios completely ignore first is the purity of the story, scripts, and chronological order of events. It doesn't even matter to the producers if positive/negative attention is given to Sword Art Online as long as the work gains popularity, discussions, and trends. Well, if you just watch anime collectively and only for enjoyment, it doesn't matter too much if the dialogues sound cheesy or unrealistic. However, there are too many clich\u00e9d story narratives, the dialogues require better writing, and [insert more heedless blobs of complaints you can read elsewhere].\\n\\n\r\nThe premise and first half of Sword Art Online actually poses an intriguing concept of survival of the fittest, which just isn't elaborated on enough to continuously track the audience's attention. In the actual light novel, there's much more emphasis on action-based themes than what's presented in the anime. Execution of the script definitely has problems, the pacing embodies inconsistencies which could've improved, and the story does contain some questionable timeline eclipses. However, it wouldn't exactly be the source material's fault if a parody of their work is bad. \\n\\n\r\n= Character (5) =\\n\\n\r\nThe main protagonist Kirito and his companion Asuna both illustrate essentially perfect beings. Kirito is a beater whose masculinity cannot be touched by anyone vincible. Comparatively, Asuna strives for a taint of sexiness with her slender yet untouchable body, and she can cook perfectly--somewhat misogynistic but inevitable. As a couple, Kirito and Asuna are both interesting subjects due to their fair share of intimate interactions with each other and other characters at first.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the chemistry between the two main romance interests, in the anime, quickly devolves into little or none at all. Events are laid out too bluntly, at a false pace, and Kirito's dedication for Asuna appears to be more artificial than in the light novels. Asuna became a target for fan service and though the appearance for fan service itself isn't exactly a terrible thing, the problem resides with how they applied that to more females. What shouldn't have processed through as a harem became apparent. Instead of illustrating the chemistry between Asuna and Kirito wholeheartedly, the Series often diverted with several unrelated (female) story arcs, which in turn didn't contribute to much of Kirito's phlegmatic personality anyways.\\n\\n\r\nThe main problem with the side characters is that barely any time is spent on them and most of them don't really have a purpose after their first appearance. Even when they do, you don't remember their names or why their presence is significant.\\n\\n\r\n= Animation (8)/Sound (9) =\\n\\n\r\nIt's almost factual that nobody can complain about the artistic aspects of Sword Art Online. The impacting action scenes did themselves justice with intense atmospheres. Character designs transported from the light novels comprised of more details and it is overall fitting. Noticeably, the background in some of the scenes portrays a vivid, limitless sky, which soothingly befits the floating island setting.\\n\\n\r\nThe Original Sound Tracks from the anime are just fine. Although it would've been better to switch around its soundtracks, the synchronization of music with the art worked out efficiently. Both the Ops & EDs consisted of scores beautifully done by the artist; Yuki Kajiura strikes the mood perfectly yet again. Each voice acting roles also surprisingly resembled their character's traits.\\n\\n\r\n= Enjoyment (7) =\\n\\n\r\nAdmittedly, Sword Art Online was a guilty pleasure the day it aired each week despite its flaws. The premise alone embraced me in a MMORPG setting which many have nostalgia for. Although a bit romanticized, the production actually portrayed the prehistoric Medieval Europe (in this case) and flourishing civilization of many cities like Venice at the time fairly well. And those familiar with the time period knows Sword Art Online just added another layer of wistfulness. \\n\\n\r\nHonestly, Sword Art Online provides decent entertainment if you watch it playfully without expecting serious, satirical works of some sort. Otherwise, it may be a disaster if you end up taking the concepts the show throws at you too literally. \\n\\n\r\n= Overall (5) =\\n\\n\r\nA well thought-out premise and concept which ended up being jammed into a catastrophic adaptation\u2014basic outline of Sword Art Online. It's really a shame that an action-packed Light Novel franchise became a victim of today's failing anime industry. This TV series comprises of lots of story arcs which should've been ignored, but was instead included due to their rewarding of pure fan service. \\n\\n\r\nThere are too many trickled-down, mixed lighthearted scenes for someone to take the anime too seriously. Yet, the producer of the anime almost expects you to nonsensically. In the end, it's up to the audience to take Sword Art Online seriously or not. For one's health, I suggest viewing this TV Series as a romantic comedy with quirky action scenes and supernatural settings. Otherwise, for the real action-packed themes promised by the premise, I guarantee that the Light Novels will present a much better experience than this \"once-in-a-lifetime\" plebeian anime adaptation.",

            "content": "Sword Art Online was one of the most hyped up animes of Summer 2012 and has probably the widest range of scores I\u2019ve ever seen. Does it live up to the hype? Read on to find out! That being said, skip to the consensus (TLDR) if you don't want to read blocks of text! :D Please do not send anything overly negative to me; polite and constructive criticism is always appreciated.\r\nPLOT:\r\nThe Good: Man, they really went for a lot here. The light novels themselves were actually more action/adventure focused, something that doesn\u2019t happen in the anime. I\u2019m going to do my best not to giveany spoilers, but essentially, the anime Sword Art Online aims to be a love story of epic proportions, where their relationship will experience highs and lows ranging from boundless joy to aching tragedy. Straight up, if you don\u2019t like the main characters, you probably won\u2019t like this anime. That\u2019s how most love stories work. However, if you\u2019re like me, and you absolutely adore the main characters, then this anime is definitely for you! Sword Art Online additionally does a brilliant job of easing us in to the massive, awe-inspiring frontier that is Aincrad. The concept of this anime -- being trapped in a strange, exotic new world and living in it -- is a dream that we all have had at one point, and it's fascinating to see it being unveiled before our eyes.\\n\\n\r\nThe Bad: At the same time, however, the execution has been done terribly. Lots of fans/first-time watchers \u2013 me included \u2013 felt that Kirito and Asuna were not given nearly enough character development. It\u2019s hard to root for someone that you barely know or hate. Another problem lies in the pace. The side stories were rushed, no doubt about, which is bad because they offered interesting insights into Kirito and Asuna\u2019s relationship and personality. At the same time, you can't really justify having two episodes of precious anime time being given to the side stories, and they honestly aren't as interesting as the main plot. Something else that irks me about Sword Art Online is how it suffers from deus ex machina. That is, it'll solve really big situations with just dumb stuff like \"it's the power of love\" or \"strength of will trumps everything\". However, other amazing shows (Harry Potter, Clannad) have done similar things, so it's whatever.\\n\\n\r\nCONSENSUS: 7/10. Sword Art Online attempted to create a love story of epic proportions\u2026something that they partially succeeded in. Although they eased us in beautifully in the start, undeveloped characters, a rushed storyline, and miracle syndrome make it lose quite a bit of its impact. \\n\\n\\n\r\nARTWORK: \\n\r\nThe artwork in this anime can be summed up into one word: inconsistent. The sceneries are drawn very well and have a wide variety (ranging from icy snowcaps to flowery meadows to beautiful cities\u2026), and the characters are done beautifully (a nice contrast to the stupid body proportions in Code Geass or the crazy facial expressions in Fate/Zero), but it gets stupidly bad during the battles. For some strange reason, instead of treating us to a smooth action sequence, we instead constantly gaze at character still shots. It\u2019s really frustrating when you know that the battle sequences could have been amazing!! Background animation is probably the most inconsistent part in that it gets really bad in towns but great in landscapes. I really don\u2019t know what to think. I think the animation of this anime is something that really sets it back from some of the great animes, and I\u2019m hoping it gets better in the future (especially the battle scenes, they can really make those a lot more enjoyable to wach).\\n\\n\r\nCONSENSUS: 7/10. Battle scenes are very badly animated, and backgrounds sometimes are drawn very sloppily. However, the sheer scope of sceneries in this anime is a delight to see.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC: \\n\r\nThe music is incredible. Yuki Kajiura is one of the biggest names in anime music, and her music is absolutely astounding. So far, the music\u2019s been perfect and set each mood beautifully. In particular, the battle scene music. Oh my god. I found myself humming it when I was eating breakfast, just a testament to how well done it is. As for the OP/ED, they\u2019re really generic. They\u2019re being done by LiSa, who\u2019s done so many OP/EDs by now, but they don\u2019t really stand out\u2026in a good or bad way. I don\u2019t know, I think Yuki Kajiura\u2019s music makes up for any disparities here though.\\n\\n\r\nCONSENSUS: 9/10, Music is great and going to be developed by Yuki Kajiura, the person who did Fate/Zero and Madoka Magica. OP/ED are generic, but that\u2019s not a bad thing. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: \\n\r\nThe characters are ridiculously hit or miss. Kirito is pretty much your perfect, flawless teenager. That\u2019s going to be a deal breaker for many of people upon knowing that. Many people like their protagonists to have flaws, to be more humanlike, more down to Earth, and having a character that\u2019s flawless frankly drops a lot of the realism. I would like to argue that the alternative of having a whiny protagonist that doesn\u2019t do anything is a lot worse though (Guilty Crown, I\u2019m looking at you). The same lies for the female protagonist, Asuna, our main character\u2019s love interest. Frankly, the relationship just came together too easily. Asuna also has the privilege of being practically perfect in every single way. No really: she can cook, she\u2019s incredibly beautiful, she\u2019s good at swordfighting, she\u2019s dedicated, and she\u2019s a tsundere (personally I love tsunderes). The side characters and the villains lack depth as well. Can anyone else picture how much more interesting this anime would have gotten if Sugou was initially some good guy that Asuna begins to fall for...only to be someone rotten in the inside? Instead, we're treated to a generic villain who literally doesn't have a single good quality.\\n\\n\r\nCONSENSUS: 6/10, Main character Kirito isn\u2019t absurdly annoying like A LOT of other main characters, but he does get what he wants a little too easily. Side characters are overly generic and get far too little time. Same with Kirito and Asuna, we needed more time for their development! \\n\\n\\n\r\nTHE BREAKDOWN: It's a great anime if you like Kirito and Asuna, but if you don't, you might as well watch another anime.

            "content": "A brave young hero. His beautiful sidekick who becomes a love interest. Dual wielding swords. A world in chaos. Lives at stake. All seem so cliche, why would I even think to watch this? I made the right decision to. I know there is alot of controversy over this anime currently so I, naturally, must enter my two cents to defend and be realistic about this hot commodity anime of 2012:\r\n*As spoiler free as can possibly be*\r\nStory:\r\nThe story is indeed EXTREMELY rushed. While the ideals and thoughts behind the initial plot are absolutely outstanding and completely unique and original, the SAO anime timeline leaves littleroom for the storyline to blossom. As a 21 year old, I found it fairly childish at times yet still enjoyable. I feel as though younger people wouldn't appreciate the underlying plots which the plot holes failed to fill and give way completely to imagination. As a biased idealist, I give the story an 8/10 because the idea is there, the timeframe wasn't. But I guess that's to be expected in today's anime industry.\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art is visually stunning and appealing. The colors draw the viewer in and the scenery is the hook. The entire landscape of Aincrad is a feast for the eyes. On the flipside, some of the fights scenes were choppily done in comparison to the beauty of the backdrops. The boss details, especially the Skull Reaper, were phenomenal and several shots were created in a very different, unexpected perspective, adding additional interest to the episode's events. So that's an A++++ to colors and imaginary vision and a B to combat scenes to make a 9/10.\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nYuki Kajiura. Need I say more? 10/10. Absolutely outstanding and completely relevant and appropriate for the anime. The music truly makes the anime and hooks the viewer emotionally.\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nKirito is your typical boy hero destined to save his love interest and destroy a corrupt system. Sure, seems pretty unoriginal. However, I connected to Kirito more than I feel many do. The episodes that seemed like fillers served as ways for us to get to know Kirito and his imperfections and taught us to let them go. While the anime completely fails in terms of side characters with failed attempts of Klein and Egil, the main characters are given enough spotlight to give the viewer a general consensus on their personality, actions, and values toward the Cardinal system of SAO. Asuna is a fantastic heroine at the beginning, immediately winning all the hearts of all male viewers and becoming a role model for young women. But as the anime progresses, the anime took a completely different direction in her character than I expected. While Asuna possessed so much strength and leadership, the anime fails to show this as it continues on, letting her slip into the whole damsel in distress role, especially in ALO. I truly felt the connection between her and Kirito and their desire to protect each other but their characters, as well as their love story, need more depth. 8/10.\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI can't lie. I truly enjoy this anime. I have such a vision of it in my head that I feel the storymakers truly intended to get across to all viewers. Whilst the anime is lacking in depth, can be corny/childish/predictable, and is unreally rushed, it provides an entertaining feast for the eyes and ears and even for the heart from episodes 8 and on. I can't deny this one a 10/10 because I truly enjoy it.\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI have to give this anime a 10/10 wholly due to the fact that I can truly envision its perfection if it could be given more time. The character ideas are there, the unique and individualistic views are there, the fantastic composer and visual settings are there. It has the correct recipe, but the incorrect \"bake time\". Putting aside my bias, it should probably deserve a generous 9/10 due to plot holes, rushed timeframe, and incomplete character development.\\n\\n\r\nHere's to hoping episode 25 will be a successful completion of an anime that could truly use a cherry on top of the sundae. The fandom will be on the edge of their seats and...so will I. I can't help it, this anime is my guilty pleasure.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Why is SAO bad? First of all let us ask what SAO is and what bad is. SAO is an anime adaptation of a light novel of the same name. The light novel was created in 2002 by Reki Kawahara, around the time when MMORPG were the craze. The anime like the name suggest is about a virtual world in a MMO. Akin to .hack//SIGN it\u00a1\u00afs about a group of people being stuck inside a videogame (at least until the third volume where the game changes) where the only way to escape is to finish the game. The MC is a guy named Kirito whomeets various people along his adventure to the top of the tower where the key to completing the game lies. However, unlike .hack//SIGN, in SAO everything that could have done really well is destroyed. Now, let us get back to what the word bad means. It means it\u00a1\u00afs not 'good in any manner or degree' according to dictionary.com and there many reasons for SAO to be bad. These reasons include overuse of cliches and overused tropes, bad characterization and that it exists as a self insert and wish fulfillment.\\n\\n\r\nA major concern I have with SAO is the uses of cliches and overused tropes. One instance is the use of the well known clause in anime where Kirito said 'Do I have to use that?' in episode 9 when fighting a boss. This is one of the biggest cliche in anime and so bad that other shows mock shows using said cliche. In the scene where Kirito said that, there were players dying from the boss. This meant that Kirito let people die because he didn't other players to find out about his skill.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the things that I found extremely irritating about SAO was the fact that Kirito was the strongest in the SAO the game barring the admin. This is evident due to the fact that he is a BEATer (a portmanteau between the words BETA and cheater). Also, he has a unique skill where only two people in the game have. Not only was Kirito overpowered, his girlfriend Asuna is overpowered as well. This might be sexist but I find it hard to believe that a girl would be good at MMO (she is one of the highest leveled person in the game) when she has never played them before even if SAO is different from normal MMOs.\\n\\n\r\nThis brings in new questions. Why did the author make the main characters the strongest? This is due to self insertion and wish fulfillment. This is painfully obvious when plenty of pretty girls such as Sachi, Lizbeth, Silica and Asuna are lusting after his manhood and his personality is very similar to teenagers who have emo tendencies and antisocial behavior so they can relate to him. He is also later shown to be a massive nerd therefore pandering to computer geeks. Asuna is particularly the largest wish fulfillment girl I have ever seen. She possess incredible power like Kirito, is considered beautiful by pretty much everyone, excels in cooking both in game and in real life and comes from a wealthy family which are considered traits of a perfect girl. However, I personally hate her due to these facts.\\n\\n\r\nThe characterization is absolutely atrocious. First there are the main characters Kirito and Azuna as I mentioned before are terrible characters with terrible characterization. They have inconsistent personality such when Kirito suddenly changes from an emo kid to a happy going person between episodes and when Asuna suddenly becomes a tsundere. Also, characters such as Sachi and Lizbeth fall in love with Kirito even though they only knew him for few days. Even Asuna is guilty of this since she had sex with Kirito despite not knowing too much about him. The only good characters in the series are minor characters such as Silica and Klein. (Why couldn't they become the main characters? Klein as the MC would have made the show better.)\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing is also a major issue. There are just too many time skips in the anime. This makes the episodes too episodic and not have real plot. I am not saying that being episodic is bad but the episodes between 2-8 serve in no point in the plot other than being a side story. The anime would have been a lot better if it was pure comedic, slice of life MMO life about a guild instead of what it is now where it changed from sol to having an actual plot which neither of them were good.\\n\\n\r\nThe only really good aspect of the anime is the music, decent character design, animation and the setting was done well. It had Yuki Kajiura as the series composer who is one of my favourite composers and LiSA, another one of my favourite, as the singer for the opening. The setting for the anime is surprisingly good and is somewhat creative. The art wasn\u00a1\u00aft anything special but was still one of the best aspect about the anime. Regardless, all of these were sadly all wasted on this bad anime.\\n\\n\r\nDespite all I said, the worst part about SAO is the potential it had to be a good anime. It could have easily become my favourite anime if it was done right. It had the trapped in the video game trope which I quite like. In the end it doesn't even matter what I write since the anime will sell like hotcake. The fact that an anime with bad characterization, plot, and plenty of cliches is the most popular is telling that anime is dead. In MAL SAO is rated higher than Nodame, Tatami Galaxy and many other anime that are better than SAO. This is disappointing and I hope publishers do not start making similar anime to SAO just because it\u00a1\u00afs popular just to make money.\\n\\n\r\n*Minor update*  \\n\r\nI would like to thank the user Veronin for helping me when I was writing this.\\n",

            "content": "Scavenge. Slay. Survive.\r\nThis is what Sword Art Online should have been about. It should have been an anime that was a pure MMORPG in anime form, as it was made out to be. What did we get instead? 55% slice of life, 25% romance, 10% action, 10% plot. SAO is quite possibly the most overrated and overhyped anime I've ever come across in my anime years. SAO is highly regarded by its fans as one of the best Light Novels ever, better than Fate/Zero, Monogatari series, Haruhi series, Kara no Kyoukai, Welcome to the NHK and Baccano for a few examples. Granted, I haven't readany of these works, but for some peculiar reason, I have an extremely hard time believing this. Why? Well, this will probably get me some flame for being biased, but because the anime is bad. Really bad. Now, some might say that it's because the adaptation of the anime is bad compared to the Novel, but I pretty much say bull. Even if that is the case, it still doesn't change the fact story is extremly generic and so far has nothing I couldn't get from watching .Hack//SIGN. If I don't like the plot and characters in the anime, I most certainately won't like them in the novel.\\n\\n\r\nBut enough with that... What exactly is it that makes me dislike this series so much that I would call it the most overrated and overhyped anime I've yet to come across? Let's begin.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: \"The animation is fantastic and incredibly smooth every single scene! It looks absolutely beautiful!\"\\n\\n\r\nFalse. While I can agree that the animation is very good looking, it's not as beautiful and gorgeous as most people make it out to be. The setting is just another generic fantasy-like setting you've already seen before in oh so many anime before SAO. The artstyle is also very unfitting. What do I mean? Let me explain very short and simple - The anime is supposed to be serious and dark (keyword being supposed) yet the artstyle makes this world look like a fairy tale due to the bright colors and round character designs. And animation wise, as in movement, looks exactly like every other anime out there. The movements are just as stiff and movement-less as the anime next to it. The only times the animation is better than your average anime is when there's a fight going on, though the choreography in these fights are pretty boring. It's mostly just rushing towards the enemy and slashing away. They could've made the fights so much more enjoyable and interesting if they put more focus on making the fights more tactical and strategy heavy. \\n\\n\r\nThe only thing I could give props for, creativly wise, is how sometimes we see from the player's POV. While this was nice the first time, this starts to get very repetitive as you get to see it in every episode and the fisheye style starts to annoy you more and more. Fortunately, this disappears about halfway and we never have to see it again. But wait... That was the only creative thing they did, and now it's gone. I don't know if I should complain or be happy. \\n\\n\r\nEven the less popular Ao no Exorcist which was also animated by A-1 Pictures was better animated than SAO in my opinion, even during the daily life events, and that one wasn't either extremly well animated. But that anime had much more interesting fights and looked a bit more flashy. Though that's to be expected seeing as that was a Shounen and this is a Seinen. Oh who am I kidding, SAO's obviously a Shounen.\\n\\n\r\nSound: \"The OST was composed by Kajiura Yuki! Instant awesomeness!\"\\n\\n\r\nWrong. While I do love Kajiura Yuki, whom has done some amazing works in some earlier titles (most notably Kara no Kyoukai), this is definitely one of her weakest works yet. The soundtrack is so far lifeless and generic and has nothing special going on with it. For being an anime about an MMORPG, I sure as hell am not getting an MMO feeling while watching this anime. The soundtrack is so generic that I could take the entire OST and put it over any other fantasy anime, and no matter how great the anime is, I would still get the same generic feeling as I get while watching SAO. It does have some nice tracks and the OST can grow on you, but as I just said, this is definitely one of her weakest works and doesn't even come close to her works in anime such as Kara no Kyoukai, Madoka Magica and the previously mentioned .Hack//SIGN.\\n\\n\r\nVoice cast wise, it's very mediocre. The voice cast is very bad at getting me entranced in the dialogues since it sounds like they are always reading straight from a script. Only some characters have proved the different, however, those characters were mostly just side characters that disappear as soon as they are introduced. It also doesn't help that all female characters speak in a typical cute way, further detracting the fact that this anime is supposed to be serious. \\n\\n\r\nSound effect wise, it's good. It has everything you would expect from an anime that has a video game theme. Swords colliding, objects disappearing, slain enemies and menu sounds.\\n\\n\r\nStory: \"The story just keeps getting better and better!\"\\n\\n\r\nNope. Well, to give it credit, it did have a solid first episode and a nice premise. People are playing a Virtual video game which they cannot escape untill they defeat the final boss. And if they are killed in the game, they won't respawn, instead they die in real life aswell! That's pretty interesting. Just a damn shame that it all went down the toilet the further down the anime went with the story. For some reason, A-1 Pictures decided to animate the side stories in episodes 3-8 which severely slowed down the pace to the point where the anime got even more boring that fillers in Shounen anime! That's not very good storytelling if you ask me! I see no reason why they couldn't have just released these episodes on the BD/DVD volumes, as this would make the anime extremely more tolerable and have a much better pace. But, does it get better when the main plot starts again? Yes, but only for a short while (short while=one episode.) After this short while, the story gets boring and makes you care less about anything. This is supposed to be a battle for survival, so why the hell is the story not showing us this gruesome world where people die in real life if they are killed in the game? Instead, it focuses on the bad romance between Kirito and his ever growing harem, which we'll get to in the character section.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the romance, if you ask me, this is what the anime is about. Not the plot, you know the whole being stuck inside a game premise, but instead the romance of our main characters. And while I do say that this is about being stuck inside an MMORPG and the objective is about escaping, this only counts for the first 14 episodes. After those episodes, SAO goes over to a very boring and very clich\u00e9 damsel in distress story.\\n\\n\r\nAnd how can I forget that SAO resorts to miracles for both of its two arcs' endings. Asspull miracles at that, since these things are never properly explained, or not explained at all.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: \"The characters are so believable! They are so full of life and relatable!\"\\n\\n\r\nI'm sorry, but I'm afraid that is incorrect. For starters, Kirito, out main protagonist is supposed to made out as a shut-in gamer Otaku. Someone who is antisocial, in so many words. So since he is just that, it's obvious that he would play as a Solo Player since he prefers to be left alone. Right? Then tell me, why the hell is he going around helping and saving more people than I can count if he's supposed to be a Solo Player? Kirito was written as a Solo Player for the first 8 episodes, and yet he helps people out during ALL of these episodes! This is a 100% contridiction to how he was claimed to be and act. But hey, we need some romance in this survival story, right? So let's throw in multiple girls whom are all after Kirito's virtual penis. The only reason why Kirito is helping out mainly females is because he's just looking for someone to bone. He finally gets one girl who is willing to give up her virtual virginity to Kirito, Asuna. Well then, Kirito finally has a girl he can have some sweet romance with. Nope. The romance between Kirito and Asuna is one of the worst written romances I've come across in an action anime. They spend so little time actually together were they would show off romantic feelings to each other that it's impossible to believe that they actually love each other. They are the typical Tsundere-Shy guy combo that you always see nowadays. And don't get me started about what happens after the first half. Oh boy, that's when things go from bad to worse.\\n\\n\r\nThe character development is barely there, mainly because these characters change personality more often than Aizen trolls somebody in Bleach. But what about the side character? Well... They're barely even there! SAO introduces a lot of characters during the first half of the series, but 75% (random percentage) of all those either never appear again (until maybe a brief cameo in the last episode) or appear way too little. They focus so much on the main characters that you start to forget that the series even introduced more characters. Not good, yo. When you create characters you need to split up the development and screen time of side characters and main characters at a good ratio. Sure, the focus should be on the main characters, but it's also important to not forget about the side characters, as they can be a good way to develop the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nValue: \"Best Light Novel ever!\"\\n\\n\r\nIf this is what people would claim to be the best Light Novel of all frakking time, then I don't know what the hell people in their right mind are thinking. Because based on the anime, AND from what I've heard happens next, I see no reason why you would call it that since the novel seems to just keep going in circles and brings nothing new. If that is what people call A-Class writing, then I guess Kubo Tite is one of the best writers of all time.\\n\\n\r\nAnd all the hate the series gets, this is your fault to blame. You, as in the ones who hyped this anime to be the most amazing thing ever produced. When you hype something as much as this one, you're risking damaging its overall appeal due to leading people into thinking that it's gonna be a masterpiece, only to be left extremely disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: \"Best Anime ever!\"\\n\\n\r\nThis could have been one of the top anime of 2012, but ended up as one of the worst of the bunch because of bad directing and awful storytelling. If the series had focused more on the actual premise, this couldn've been a bit more interesting - however - the bad decision to put the side stories among the main episodes, the poorly written romance and the incredibly clich\u00e9 plot (especially in its second half) makes SAO one hell of a drag to watch. It had its few moments, such as an interesting first episode, and a pretty okay episode 10. But the majority of the anime is nothing more than wish fullfillment and fan catering, appealing only to MMORPG players, teenagers and otaku.\\n\\n\r\nBest anime ever my ass.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now for my own enjoyment; where's that anime adaptation of Chapter 16.5?\\n\\n\r\nhttp://i48.tinypic.com/2v8041y.jpg",

            "content": "I've heard many things about SAO (Sword Art Online): There's either a lot of love or a lot of hate for it. Personally, I'm leaning a little towards the latter, but not fully on it. Before you start sending me hate mail or press the \"Not Helpful\" button, please hear me out.\r\nAs a gamer, and a fan of MMORPG's, I tried to keep my expectations not too high, because you know what they say: \"The bigger they are, the harder they fall\". Unfortunately, SAO fits this saying to a T, as it was one of the most disappointing anime that I've seen this year. Why?Well, why do think I'm writing this forsaken review?!\\n\r\n~~~~~~\\n\r\nStory: (3/10)\\n\r\nThe story of SAO involves players getting trapped within an VRMMORPG (Virtual Reality Massive Multiplayer Online Roleplaying Game), in which they are required to beat all 100 floors of the game in order to leave. The catch is, however, that if a character's HP drops to zero before clearing the game, not only do they die in the game, they also die in real life. \\n\\n\r\nThe concept of this story is absolutely brilliant. Unfortunately, the execution of this story is poor. The writing and pacing is just awful. Even during the SAO arc of the show, while this was tolerable, I was left wondering, \"What on earth is happening here?\" The Alfheim arc, on the other hand, was just... I don't even want to describe it. Parts of Episodes 21 and 24 were just borderline unwatchable... (I'm not going to say which parts, just to avoid spoilers...) At least the ending was somewhat satisfying...\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the story was just utter CRAP. A good premise at first, but was terribly executed due to poor writing.\\n\r\n~~~~~~\\n\r\nCharacters: (2/10)\\n\r\nIn my opinion, the characters of Sword Art Online were by far the weakest part of the show. The main male character, Kirito, is just a Gary Stu, and nothing more. But somehow, he has the ability to attract girls by just looking at them. Why are these girls attracted to him? I'll never know. The main female character, Asuna, was introduced in Episode 2 as a badass who I had high hopes for. And what happens with her? The writers decide to turn her into a generic tsundere, and in the Alfheim arc of the show, she basically turns into f**king Princess Peach. Suguha, other than being there for the sake of fanservice, and to be part of a love triangle that involved a little bit of incest (It didn't work for me in Elfin Lied, it doesn't work for me here...), pretty much served next to no purpose (In my eyes). And to go into deeper detail about Kirito and Asuna, I could not for the LIFE OF ME understand the romance with Kirito and Asuna. It felt so forced and plot-driven that it made me feel absolutely frustrated. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, I'd be lying if I didn't say that the reunion of Kirito (or Kazuto) and Asuna during the final episode was heartwarming... (but I digress).\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting characters were either uninteresting or just really annoying. The only character I had actual interest in was Klein, but even then, he was pretty much tossed aside. And as for Sugou, he is one of the worst villains I have ever seen. Period. He just absolutely disgusts me... (Though he has a certain line that's absolutely HILARIOUS!)\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, next to none of the characters were interesting or likeable in the slightest...\\n\r\n~~~~~~\\n\r\nArt/Animation: (10/10)\\n\r\nWith my bitching and moaning aside, what DO I like in SAO? That's easy. I love how it looks. The art in this show is absolutely beautiful. From the scenery to the action scenes, the animation is consistent and fluid, and the scenery is just gorgeous. Maybe it's the fact that graphics/art is one of the major things I look into within a video game, but I digress.\\n\\n\r\nWith animation, this anime hits a perfect bullseye.\\n\r\n~~~~~~\\n\r\nMusic: (8/10)\\n\r\nSince I'm not a person to critique VA, I'll just talk about the music. Just like the art, I also really enjoyed the music of Sword Art Online (and because I'm a fan of Yuki Kajiura). It reminded me of the countless hours I used to spend on MapleStory leveling up my character. The first opening, \"Crossing Fields\", got me pumped for an episode; giving me SOME hope that the show would somehow redeem itself (Sadly, it didn't).\\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, the music was as good as the art!\\n\r\n~~~~~~\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (4/10)\\n\r\nWhile I did enjoy Sword Art Online in the beginning, progressing through it turned into more of a chore than an enjoyment. Most of the SAO arc was \"meh\", and the Alfheim arc was just painful to watch. If it wasn't for the action scenes, this would've been rated MUCH lower.\\n\r\n~~~~~~\\n\r\nOverall Score: 5.4 out of 10 (Rounded down to 5)\\n\r\nIn my honest opinion, Sword Art online was just painfully average. While the art and music are amazing, the story and characters prevent the show from being anything memorable (At least for me). Like I said before, it is definitely one of the most disappointing anime I have seen this year. Although it's not a 1 in my eyes, it's also not a 10.\\n\\n\r\nWas it worth the hype? No.\\n\r\nWill I watch it again? Probably not.\\n\\n\r\n*Feedback and Constructive criticism is welcome! Just don't be too nasty about it.*",

            "content": "|This review contains minor spoilers of the shitty story and characters|\r\nOh Sword Art Online, how you fooled millions of people into thinking that this show will be every gamer and anime fans' dream-come-true. We all came in, watched the first episode and thought \" This actually looks pretty cool \" , and continued watching like fish on a fishing rod. How wrong were we? Well, I will tell you, fellow readers, how the anime that received one of the largest fan-bases in recent times, holds the pinnacle of the word 'Overrated '; and I will do my best to convince you to NOT watch thisanime.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 2\\n\\n\r\nNow let's begin this review with discussing about the 'gripping' story, that led such a large fan-base into picking up SAO. So, I am not going to talk about the synopsis, as MAl has it displayed at all times, but I have to say that 'disappointment' is an understatement when describing the story of this anime. The biggest disappointment when watching this anime was the colossal time-skips that the anime takes. At one moment Kirito (the main character of the series) is a weakling, and literally in the blink of an eye, he is the most over-powered in the game. Thus, character-development is thrown out of the window. You just can't bring out a realistic and gripping story with such decisions. \\n\r\nThe other fact that made the story ridiculous, was the fact that Kirito simply levels so fast by PLAYING ALONE in a bloody MMORPG. If you have played at least 1 game of this genre, you would be highly aware that this is further than impossible, as you would need at least 100 players to beat a boss, of which all players must be very highly leveled. Thus the story becomes so poor and unrealistic, that it is almost hilarious.\\n\r\nThe first arc of SAO, which consists of the first 15 episodes, in terms of story overall, was terrible. There were time-skips and an unrealistic story. However, were the story becomes even more ridiculous is the second arc, which consists of the rest of the story. A damsel-in-distress is again, an understatement. You all should be fully aware of the video-game franchise 'Mario'. Kirito is Mario and Asuna (which I will talk about how awful of a character she is in my character section of this review), is princess Peach. And i am not exaggerating at all. This becomes so annoying, that watching this series, I remember wanting to bash my head against the wall to ease my fury. Oh wait, there's more! Ever wanted to see a character in a non-ecchi anime being 'done' by tentacles? Well this is the anime for you! Cause I am sure that all the kids that watched this series, thinking that it would be like a Disney film ended up getting rather scarred.\\n\r\nThe last factor that determines my score of '2' is the slice-of-life elements of the show, that tricked the whole audience of the show into thinking that this anime would be consisted of badass action sequences and a complex story. No. Instead, what we get is two idiots telling how much they love each other (even though they met in a game) for most of the series with little to no action. Enjoy.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 1\\n\\n\r\nOh you thought that I was telling the worst about this anime, were you? Well don't worry, it gets much worse in this section. To put it simply, the characters in this series are laughable, generic, idiotic and extremely one-dimensional. I will talk about some of the characters of the series.\\n\\n\r\n1. Kirito: So what do you get when you mix Makoto from school Days and every other generic protagonist from a harem series, combined with a bit retardation. You get Kirito of course! This guy is living a harem with 5 girls in this series, for absolutely no reason at all. The girls are treated like mindless retards that the only thing that pleases them is a douche like Kirito because of black hair and clothes. This guy is worse than a regular, clueless male lead from a harem series as he does not only understand the situation he finds himself in, but also does not give a shit. He dumps all he rest of the women (including side-chicks) and guess who he decides to go with in the end; HIS FUCKING SISTER. Yes, this anime is incestuous beyond belief. Kirito is the epitome of everything I hate in an anime character combined.\\n\\n\r\n2. Asuna: This chick is the one which receives the worst development (of almost all) of anime i have seen . She starts off looking like a cool female lead, with a large potential of evolution, and then, all of the sudden, she enters a part of Kirito's harem with what seems like so reason at all. She did not give a damn about Kirito, and then instantly wants his D, after sleeping on a field with him, for whatever reason that is.\\n\\n\r\nThe relationship of Asuna and Kirito is not only extraordinarily unrealistic, but also dreadful, as this relationship is seen to be so forceful. |SPOILERS| They end up adopting this one girl they find in the woods, and this is when the characters become so BAD. This father-daughter and mother-daughter relationship is so off from real life it's funny. The end up wasting most of the first arc with deciding whether to keep this girl or not (of which destroys the genres of this series wholly) and makes you think this show is a pathetic Clannad rip-off.\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters in this series are so forgettable I have forgotten most of their names as a result. The girls are shown to be whores with no wit, while the antagonists of the show are BEYOND HILARIOUS. The main antagonist of the series has NO purpose to trap this people in this world and kill them off. NO reason at all. This guy simply wants to look evil for no ulterior purpose, because this show needs a reason to exist.\\n\r\nIn the end, the characters receive little to no development, while proving to the audience that ' the power of friendship' exists in a couple such as Kirito and Asuna, as the romance is so bad in this series, that it feels like Asuna gets friend-zoned by Kirito for wants to jump his sister, which she was the worst character of all. For absolutely no reason at all, this girl wants to bang her brother (which the anime makes statements here and there stating that they are cousins living in the same house, which is still nonsensical). And Kirito falls for her because his motto is \" THE BIGGER THE TITS THE BETTER \".\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Art : 8\\n\\n\r\nI have to give credit to A-1 pictures for producing an anime that has decent-looking colors, and a fair amount of frames within the little battle-sequences this anime holds. The art however is nothing that spectacular as to up the score any more than it already is, as an anime which received such a massive audience deserved a greater production value, in my opinion. The background are usually fairly done, and there is no real lack of consistency when dealing with the anime as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nYuki Kajiura is an amazing composer and I feel that her music really fit the atmosphere of the show. It's a shame that she wasted her efforts in such a show like this, but whatever. The openings are both fantastic, with greater emphasis to the first one, \" Crossing Field \" which really suited the tone of the anime itself, combined with an excellent chorus.\\n\r\nAs a lot of anime, the voice-acting of SAO was on-par and did their job very well (with reference to the original Japanese dub), so whatever part i had to take seriously, I did due to the well executed emotions portrayed through words. Again, its a shame that they bothered to do such a good job on an anime like this.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3\\n\\n\r\nI tried to enjoy this show, I really did. But I could not take it seriously due to the harem, ecchi and incestuous nature of the show itself. The characters clearly lacked any substance and the story was laughable, thus further lowering my enjoyment of the show. The only facts that upped my enjoyment, was the fantastic opening, that made me want to watch each episode for that purpose. The animation made me enjoy the anime a bit more as well, but all these do not compensate with the sheer horror of the show's execution.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3\\n\\n\r\nOf course, the animation/art and sound only play for a small part of the overall score. The story and characters were anything below pathetic, and thus could not credit the show itself. Please, do yourself a favor and skip this entry, it is not worth your time at all. Don't get fooled by the popularity of the show itself, as that is not an indication of how good the show is, instead proves how many souls were lost in wasting their time on an anime like this.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review!

            "content": "Remember back in July I said that seeing the hype, this would probably become the next Guilty Crown? Well, reflecting on that now\u2026I would like to sincerely apologize\u2026to the Guilty Crown fans because Sword Art Online is nowhere near Guilty Crown\u2019s level in terms of visuals and soundtrack. \r\nAs we all know, studio A-1 is not known for action based anime. Most of their signature works are slice of life romantic comedies. The character designs are reminiscent of those in Working!! despite the fact that this show markets itself as a serious action fantasy series. Action scenes heavily utilized flash frames in order to cutcorners. Most of the time, the viewers are just shown the expressions of the characters instead of what is actually happening to the scene as a whole. In some instances, frames from previous episodes were even reused. Saying that the visuals were underwhelming is an understatement. \\n\\n\r\nThe music department is one of the few redeeming qualities of this show although this is perhaps Kajiura\u2019s most lackluster work in recent years. Some parts of soundtracks seem recycled right out of her recent works. Not to mention that sometimes, the music does not fit that particular scene. To put it simply, the music was nice, but lacks soul.\\n\\n\r\nUp until now, we\u2019ve covered the visuals and the music. Both aspects are mediocre at worst and are not bad enough to garner the negativity towards this show. So what went wrong? Well, obviously the leftover parts: the plot and the characters. \\n\\n\r\nTruth be told, the premise of the story had potential. However, that raw potential was untouched and on top of that, was marred by absolutely horrid execution in terms of storytelling and progression. An easy phrase to apply here is \u201cshow, not tell\u201d. Several backstory filler episodes were carelessly dumped into the beginning of the series giving the impression that the writers didn\u2019t care enough to put in the effort in order to integrate those side stories nicely into the series. To add insult to injury, those episodes were rushed. It\u2019s pretty ridiculous how the progression would have seemed smoother and more acceptable if the content was cut. And as the viewer continue watching, the story becomes a mass of plotholes rampant with tasteless fanservice that are randomly thrown in; In particular, the breaking of game mechanics written in cold, hard code at the convenience of the main characters which will be covered in the next section. Again, this is just very contradictory considering the fact that this show is trying to get viewers to take it seriously. You really have to wonder if the writers have forgotten that this is supposed to be a story about an MMORPG.\\n\\n\r\nNow we come to the last nail in the coffin: characters. Overpowered main characters are not uncommon and there are generally no problems if they are done well. Sword Art Online, unfortunately, did not handle this trope with expertise and fell into the trap where the main character bends plot more than gravity stretches time. Kirito is a walking deus ex machina. He can do and experience things that are impossible according to previously shown game mechanics. His personality and traits also changes according to the situation such as being a fumbling idiot one moment yet two minutes later he is soloing mobs while spitting out cheesy phrases from some Clint Eastwood movie. He simply does not leave a lasting impression other than his role and abilities in the story. Take away his dual wielding abilities and what do you remember him for? Nothing. On top of that, the story gives no sense of excitement due to his overpowering presence. The viewer does not feel pressured to known what\u2019s going to happen next since it\u2019s a given that Kirito will resolve the situation with no problems. Asuna, on the other hand, was introduced as a strong capable female but turned into a damsel in distress under the influence of Kirito\u2019s plot wielding; eventually becoming a fap fodder waifu character. What\u2019s also not helping the cast is that there are no significant characters other than the main characters. Side characters are pretty much irrelevant given their almost nonexistent character development. It\u2019s almost as if they are taking on an episodic approach to the characters despite the fact that this story is supposedly linear with a clear objective or ending in mind.\\n\\n\r\nThe final verdict? A three out of ten. This is taken into account the fact that I've changed into a masochist and this show has given me enjoyment and gratification with it's absolutely tortuous delivery. You really have to wonder if fans of this show love the premise of the series or the series itself. Perhaps this show would have done better if it chose a simply fantasy setting instead since it obviously wasn\u2019t adeptly incorporating elements of an MMORPG. In the end, Sword Art Online is a show that can present the who, what, when, and where with efficiency but fails completely to explain how and why I should bother giving a tiny rat\u2019s ass. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Story-\r\nSword Art Online (SAO) had real promising from reading the synopsis; however, I feel that it failed to delivery on all the hype it was getting. But after watching several episodes I feel like SAO has two major issues which make the anime really hard and jarring to get into. These two problems are the Story and the Characters.  The story starts off with the premise that players are trapped within the game, SAO, and the only way to get out is to clear all 100 levels. But the problem here, with the story, is that the anime tends to skip months at atime, which is very jarring as a view. It felt as if I missed out of entire events from watching one episode to another. \\n\\n\r\nThe story, though 11 episodes, hasn't really gone anywhere aside from the main characters fighting bosses and proceeding through the levels, but the main problem is that there is no \"main\" villain per say. And what I mean is that we don't really see a villain (can be argued that the game is the main villain, but I don't think that this was intended).  This bothers me personally, I like to see who is pulling the strings or at least some hint of someone behind everything. Sure we saw the creator in episode one, but after that he is never mention again, as of yet. So I've given the story a lower score because it just seems to not be going anywhere and because of skipping so much time.\\n\\n\r\n3/10\\n\\n\r\nArt-\\n\\n\r\nCharacters look great, sets look great, different levels have different art styles, and they all look great. Not much more to say here.\\n\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nSound-\\n\\n\r\nI really loved the music in SAO, I felt like it harmonized well with the different levels worked well during the fight scenes. Enjoyed the music.\\n\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(s)-\\n\\n\r\nThere are really only two main characters that we see on a regular basis and the problem is, well, they're pretty boring. There is no real development for our main hero and heroine because they've skipped so much time in the anime and we're not given time enough to get to know and like these characters. I think that the relationship between the two are rushed and is hard to believe. They are too perfect and have no flaws or interesting traits to them, basically they're two dimensional and have no depth to them. \\n\\n\r\n2/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall I think that the story and characters really dragged down SAO from being what it was hyped to be. And the problems are so huge that it's hard to over look them and enjoy the anime. From the time skipped, months at a time, I felt very disconnected from the world they presented because I felt as if I missed so much. So it's hard for me to really give SAO a good score because I believe it had great potential and premise. But overall I would give SAO a 4/10 for the problems mention above.",

            "content": "I heard all this hype about Sword Art Online. Any anime site worth its salt has heard of it. It's vaunted as one of the best animes of 2012, and I heard pretty good stuff about it! However if there's one rule about anime is that the more hyped it is, the more crushing when it turns out to be a disappointment. SAO is one of these.\r\nIt started out with an interesting premise: ten thousand people are locked into a virtual reality game, with no law or order. They must beat the game in order to get out. At the forefront is Kirito, a skilledplayer and one of the original players of the game. It sounds good on paper.\\n\\n\r\nThe issue with this is that Kirito is a borderline Gary Stu. He's the Ace, the secret weapon of the players, and all the player's hopes rides on his shoulders. Okay, apart from being a typical sounding shonen hero, that isn't anything special. What IS, however, is that he picks up a LOT of skills that become more and more often deus ex machinas. He steals the spotlight from every other character so everyone else, even our female protagonist, Asuna, can only stare in awe off to the side. \\n\\n\r\nAsuna went from a powerful, pretty awesome character to the love interest that every anime requires. Her powers and skills as co-leader of the best guild in the game gradually dwindle until she's little more than a plot point. The romance between the two is nonexistent, despite it being praised as one of the anime's strongest points. If this is supposed to be the strongest point, I'm glad I didn't exactly go into this with high expectations. I'm not sure the author knew how romance works and that this was wish fulfillment. News flash guys, girls don't hang out with you, eat with you for a few episodes, and then decide they want to marry you. That doesn't happen.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters, especially the female characters, all fall in love with Kirito. Why? I don't know; it isn't revealed. It's as if just being there is enough to charm everyone in sight. That was where I started dreading turning on my computer to watch this awful excuse for a romantic drama. They're shallow, one-dimensional, and bring little to no depth to the storyline whatsoever. They're only purpose is to long after Kirito, making it seem like a poorly written harem story.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is awful, despite having a strong premise. Go up a hundred floors (most of these aren't even shown), beat the boss, leave the game. Okaaay... what about leveling? Or getting better equipment? Interactions between guilds? Friendly duels? Anything NORMAL that you'd expect from an MMORPG? Nope, none of that is present, with the exception of illegal duels which eventually becomes murder cases (Kirito solves these, by the way). \\n\\n\r\nThe art is just... meh. It wasn't extraordinary and honestly looks like something I'd see out of a dime-a-dozen manga from 2006. No effects really seemed to catch my eye, and the scenery was just average. I expected more from a 2012 anime. \\n\\n\r\nSound? It does have a pretty nice opening, and the soundtrack is also nice, so if that's your thing, go for it. However, it's simply not enough to bring to the table. I had to force myself after episode fourteen to find episode fifteen and watch it. \\n\\n\r\nSAO is over-hyped. It  didn't live up to half the expectations I set, and I set pretty low standards. It's the perfect example of wish fulfillment to the highest degree.",

            "content": "*THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*\r\nSword Art Online is a pioneer of its genre in that, the source material dates from all the way back in 2002 (.hack// being of the same vintage).  This is important to note as with all pioneering feats, there is an initial sense of wonder and hype, followed by disappointment as the same concept is refined and improved upon.   To give an example, the Victorians pioneered the underground railway in London, a marvel at its time but it was soon realised that they dug the tunnels too small.  The tiny, overcrowded trains of today cannot be appreciated forits breakthrough in technology.  SAO, due to its nature therefore shows the same seemingly obvious flaws that only become apparent in hindsight.\\n\\n\r\nWith that said, SAO is a fantastic piece of work considering how the author was only a high school student at the time, and how he ventured into previously unexplored territory.   The author and the subsequent adaptation by A1 pictures successfully manages to impress the intended audience; the teenage market.  This is done through a careful blend of adventure, cliffhangers , pacing, deux es machinas and a good cast of girls.\\n\\n\r\nThe show starts off with a highly interesting premise with players in a perfectly modelled virtual reality.  Since their consciousness is surrendered to the NervGear hardware, the only way to return to the real world is through the \u201cLog Out\u201d button which has unfortunately gone walkies.  We follow the life events of our protagonist, Kirito as he battles his way through his ups and downs, which is not limited to fighting.\\n\\n\r\nKirito also faces a daunting challenge emotionally, as the stakes are exceptionally high.  A death in-game equates to death in real life.  These obstacles flesh out the human nature of Kirito\u2019s character in great detail.  His behaviour, emotions and actions are closely related to his recent happenings and experiences.  Kirito starts off as a social recluse who prefers to limit his interactions with other people.  This leads him to shun the cooperative nature of MMORPGs and plays solo.  Through a chance encounter, Kirito manages to befriend a group and re-learn the significance of friendship and comradeship, and how that improves his mental well-being.  This does not lead to the unrealistic result of Kirito becoming instantly socially adept, as he faces further obstacles and setbacks that push him back to his reclusive old self.  Such flaws truly show that Kirito is simply a mere mortal with variable emotions and feelings, which serves to connect with the viewer with empathy.  For Kirito is only the strongest player in SAO due to his effort and research, rather than simply being perfect.  Only through real experience can Kirito grow as a person, and the growth is closely tied in with the story.\\n\\n\r\nA1 Pictures is to be commended for only highlighting the most significant parts of Kirito\u2019s story as he fights to clear the game.  Thousands of hours of level-grinding which was normal in the Everquest era of 2002 (when SAO was written) has given way to achievement caps relating to the hours you play in a day in 2012 (when SAO was adapted).  To put it in simpler terms, the firms that make MMORPGs implementing such caps means the community has democratically voted with their wallets that level grinding is far too troublesome and boring.\\n\\n\r\nWe are therefore treated to relevant side stories instead of level-grinding filler.  Each of these side stories involves an encounter with a supporting cast with wide variations in personalities and nature of the quest.  Through the use of variety in the story, not only do we get to see Kirito develop, but also the world.  The viewer is introduced to the world of MMORPGs involving Guilds, Raids, Smithing, Conspiracy and even a compelling virtual romance that becomes the foundation of a timely rejuvenation of Kirito\u2019s character.  Relationships however, are a two-way street and Asuna\u2019s (the main heroine and Kirito\u2019s girlfriend) worldview is also seamlessly influenced, and improved.  The two-way nature of the relationship really makes it convincing, and leaves a lasting impression.  The end product is an Asuna, despite her obvious flaws as a human, becomes a character whom many would look up to, due to her dedicated and faithful nature that was born out of hardship.\\n\\n\r\nAll of the above really shows that the writers performed an exceptional job.  The accurate portrayal of the fickle nature of human emotions, and especially during the tumultuous years of adolescence really brings the show to life.  The level of language, and the tones used by the voice actors were highly appropriate.  They successfully avoid Kirito sounding like an aged professor with a PhD in SAO, and a realistic mix of rational decision making and emotionally-charged angst is used.\\n\\n\r\nThe quality of writing continues with the way the villains are portrayed.  The first major villain, Kayaba is an accurate rendition of the genius, lost in his own world, which he seeked to control.  He is the prime example of a person termed as a sociopath.  The best aspect of him however is not his character itself, but the way he integrated himself into the storyline, and produced the most unexpected plot twist.  This twist is a very crafty, and convincing one due to it being totally out of the blue yet in hindsight, perfectly plausible.\\n\\n\r\nThe second villain, Sugou on the other hand, is the purest example of a villain in recent times.  Villains are meant to be bad, but not all can be successful at being bad and unique at the same time.  A recent, highly successful example to compare is Raoul Silva, the highly-acclaimed villain in James Bond\u2019s Skyfall.  Not only was Silva bad, he was amusingly bad and obviously received pleasure from just being plain \u2018badass\u2019.  In SAO, Sugou betters Silva by not only bringing amusement, but also the purest feeling of disgust against the character.  In essence, Sugou is the victim of his own success, and the show goes to great extent by detailing his personality and motives.  The icing on the cake is when Sugou subjects Asuna to the unthinkable, further solidifying the author and A1\u2019s innovative risk-taking with the series.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough show is somewhat lacking in all-out battle action which comes across as strange, due to its highly suggestive title; the art of swordcraft,  the worry is misplaced.  The rarity of such scenes only serves to enhance the excitement during the boss battles.  The immersion is further exemplified by the convincing use of light effects during animated scenes.  This highly appropriate use of animation technique serves to amplify the effect of each, and every single hacking and slicing motion.  Instead of Diablo-style hack and slice spamming, we are treated with the significance of each motion.  A1 Pictures have clearly taken on board the mantra of quality over quantity.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, following the mantra means the show tried to cover too much, in too little time.  An attempt at too much quality in too little time.  SAO attempts to provide a realistic and varied portrayal of the world of MMOGs.  They have unfortunately made the pioneer\u2019s mistake of being far too ambitious.  Some characters are casted a little too far to the side and that includes those that greatly influenced Kirito\u2019s development being one-episode wonders.  This is especially evident in the \u2018Aria\u2019 sub-arc where A1 Pictures attempted to cover too much ground in a single episode when Asuna was introduced.  Nevertheless, while this may seem detrimental, the flip side is of course, the less intrusive nature of the side cast.  This approach avoids the trap of character bloat which other series have fallen into.  Despite the blunder with \u2018Aria\u2019, Asuna gets the focus she needs later in the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe excellent writing and animation is greatly amplified by the renowned composer, Kajiura Yuki who worked on the music.  The style of the music resembles her most recent previous work (Fate/Zero), but is sufficiently different to set it apart, reminiscent of the time she worked on  Mai-HiME and Tsubasa Chronicles back-to-back.  She forgoes her usual techno, and instead utilizes a greater reliance on classic instruments and the orchestra.  A highly appropriate decision as the art of swordsmanship and the resulting swordfights are traditional in nature.  Despite classical instruments being rather \u2018soft\u2019 in comparison with electronic music, Kajiura delivered beautifully with the softer style actually multiplying the effectiveness of the battle scenes.  Her mix of opera in the battle tracks only serves to give a sense of \u2018epic\u2019, seen in the likes of \u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nIt is important at this point to mention that SAO actually has two, highly distinct arcs.  The second arc is not a death game, but a race against time.  It also gives a much-needed change in pace from the seriousness that hung over the first arc.  Unfortunately, the benefits of a slightly light-hearted arc is also its downfall.  The sense of urgency from the race against time was not portrayed in the best manner, with Kirito taking seemingly pointless detours, which in actuality was in fact, perfectly reasonable.  A1 Pictures disappointed in this regard, disconnecting the viewer with the character\u2019s decision-making.  Nevertheless, the detours sets the foundations of Kirito developing in the real world, and explores his relationship with people that are the closest to him.  Aside from the minor drawback, the quality of writing is still very good (but not excellent) and the quality of animation and music is maintained.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the excellence of the individual components (e.g. sound, animation) come together at the end to give the viewer an anime that is pleasant to see, awe-inspiring to hear, and minds in intrigue with the story.  A1 Pictures has successfully created an adaptation that entertains a wide variety of audiences.  SAO is a must watch for fans of adventure, fantasy, romance and even harem.  Even the detractors derived a whole new level of entertainment, expressed in forms not limited to reaction videos on YouTube.  The product\u2019s success is clearly seen through pure, objective evidence by means of Blu-Ray sales as viewers have overwhelmingly embraced SAO.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, SAO gets an excellent 9/10.  A truly enjoyable series that crosses an extremely wide range of anime fanbases which is no mean feat.  It is probably fair to deduct a single point in light of the slight weakness in \u2018Aria\u2019 and in the second arc but not any more than that due to the amount of ground that required covering in order to complete Kirito\u2019s development.\\n\\n\r\nNow that I\u2019ve mentioned \u2018Aria\u2019, there is another anime of the same name.  This series must never be watched, for it involves girls simply rowing boats for 3 whole seasons.  Worst of all, a \u2018moeblob\u2019 (in other words, \u2018moe[brown stuff]\u2019) loli character is introduced, being evidenced by her having an S-tier Zettai Ryouiki.  The wise community must avoid such monstrosity going after easy cash and stick to shows of a deep and profound nature, such as SAO.",

            "content": "Yes! Yeeees! Oh, let me taste your tears, Asuna! \r\nMm, your tears are so yummy and sweet!\r\nOh, the tears of unfathomable sadness! Yummy~\r\nIn a world where series' like Harry Potter, or other real abhorrent fanfiction tittles the likes of Twilight sells well enough for multiple sequels, it shouldn't be a surprise then, Sword Art Online's popularity skyrocketing that is. Pretty posters, familiarity, perhaps male power fantasies and the like, etc. There are numerous factors that play a part in a works' popularity; but it's hard to pin-point just what exactly got SAO such hype. Especially since it becomes apparent that it was already losing it'sfocus just after the third episode. In a similar vein to SAO's sister in terms of popularity still that very same year, Guilty Crown also had an (ostensibly) enormous fanbase even before it aired. It's a mystery really. \\n\\n\r\nSAO is a clear indication that it's target audience are easy to profit from. Which is exactly why it makes it just the kind of anime that makes you wonder about where the anime industry could be heading. It is not a positive influence. And unfortunately for the supporters, SAO does provide with more than enough empirical evidence to tell them that it is garbage but, that would be unfair as there actually is entertainment value to be had here.\\n\\n\r\nIn the visual department SAO definitely excels, maybe not enough to make a graphic artist have wet dreams over, though. From the character designs to the very world which they reside in, it is all aesthetically pleasing. And while consistent and fluid in it's animation, it's a little rough around the edges during the fight scenes. There's an abuse of stills to express 'action', and distorted facial expressions used in an otherwise uneventful location (was that actually intended to be used for comedic effect? Welp). Of course, this alone wouldn't damper the experience. If everything else were intact, this would remain relatively unnoticed. \\n\\n\r\nAn interesting concept? A Charismatic main character? world building? SAO had just about everything working in it's favor to make it anime of that year. But even with the few legitimate merits it has it does away with them in favor of, well, to make our hero The Black Swor- wait, no one actually confuses to whom that tittle belongs to, right..? - Kirito, more of a flawless gary stu. \\n\\n\r\nAll complete with enough deus ex-machinas to make you puke.\\n\\n\r\nThousands of players dying? All off-screen and no one gives a crap about statistics. Boss fights? Essentially, a grand total of three and they don't re-spawn.You never really get a sense of dread in the world of SAO. Even the very first death was due to a player refusing to take a life potion. And that's all in the first half of the series. The second half? Not even going to touch it. Unless, of course, we're talking about Suguha's sugus here.\\n\\n\r\nAnd as you can imagine, with it taking itself so seriously already, when it come to the uh... romance the end result is laughable. Later on, at one point Asuna said something around the lines of, \"Kirito has changed me, everything I am as it is now is because of him\". I started to cringe at that point, none of what she said happened. The characterization suffers almost as much as the writing; or vice versa. Every villain is cartoonishly evil and every supporting character doesn't fair any better either. All of the 'character development' happens during the constant time skips, successfully nullifying it and making for a heavily disjointed pacing. And It doesn't help that the script is akin to that of an eroge. Meaning: A) relationships take on a surrealistic fast pace. B) can't hear a confession a foot away from you. C) Being nice is enough to attract females from all corners of the land, etc.\\n\\n\r\nSAO could very well be suggesting you to be a Infidelity-committing, sister-fornicating, misogynistic pedophile who loves rape as fanservice. Topped only by those slimy tentacles everyone likes. -- It doesn't encourage anything positive, it's too delusional to do so. All the gamer pandering, multiple relationships, etc. It only serves to further take away any sense of realism it might have had, including it's potential to construct a society within a virtual world; firmly planting it into wish-fulfillment territory. \\n\\n\r\nSplendorous action - this is the only reason I can think of as to why I would recommend this show. And yet, despite all that, knowing that it falls off the rails, crashes and burns; it get's back on the tracks again, and again only to end up crashing. \\n\\n\r\nIt's fun, if only to mock it.",

            "content": "I might as well skip the plot synopsis of Sword Art Online, because odds are you already know it. Sword Art Online has utterly exploded. It is all over the place. It is that one show the EVERYONE is watching, whether it be through genuine interest or sheer bile fascination. And amidst this, it has split the anime fandom enormously between those who utterly love it and those who absolutely hate it. As you no doubt checked what I scored this before anything else, you can probably tell I'm in the latter camp.\r\nIn the event that you've been living under a rock these past 6months, Sword Art Online revolves around an online game that allows full immersion, that all of it's players soon become trapped in via the classic \"you die here, you die in the real world\" plot device. All the game's players are now trapped in a brutal survival game, as per a ton of other anime that you have doubtlessly watched at least one of before. SAO's first and most obvious fault even to someone who hasn't watched it would be that the premise is incredibly generic - it's just a cobbling-together of Mirai Nikki and .Hack, amongst others, and neither were very good to start with.\\n\\n\r\nBut for all my complaints with the series SAO scrapped itself together from, at least those series bothered with a coherent narrative. SAO's story is an inconsistent and appallingly-paced trainwreck, jumping through numerous ill-placed timeskips and sudden shifts in the style of the story in a way that is, to make an understatement of it, very jarring.\\n\\n\r\nThe series goes through several stages. The first is confined to episode 1, AKA the only good episode. It serves to set up the plot, and does a decent enough job of it. However, rather than following said plot, it quickly switches to episodic journeys through the world our protagonist is trapped in. In theory that isn't such a terrible idea, but any promise it had is ruined by drearily slow pacing, and more importantly, the most mind-numbingly flat Gary Stu viewer self-insertion blank slate of a protagonist you could possibly imagine. His sole character trait is that he is an extremely powerful player (worse yet, any development into such a powerful player happens offscreen).\\n\\n\r\nAround the episode 9 mark, the actual plot starts to take place. Kirito, the aforementioned dullard emotion-bot protagonist, befriends Asuna, a similarly one-dimensional fellow player he met in an earlier episode, and through a series of events is dragged into joining her guild, who plan to take on the final boss of SAO. In the process of this, the two become romantically involved. Sorry, did I say the plot happened here? My mistake, it actually gets thrown out the window at the first hint of romance. The whole \"escaping SAO\" plot is put on hold for several episodes while Kirito and Asuna's romantic \"subplot\" takes over. This doesn't seem that bad until you remember that Kirito and Asuna are totally one-dimensional. Fittingly enough, their romance feels forced and completely fake. How they even \"fall in love\" is totally ignored - they just do.\\n\\n\r\nEventually, they get a move on with the damned plot, and *SPOILER ALERT* - everything comes to an extremely rushed and sudden conclusion (especially jarring due to how drearily slow everything was before), and they manage to beat SAO, in spite of some major leaps of logic involving how it actually happened. At last, everyone can escape this wretched game, and continue with their lives. Happy ending!\\n\\n\r\n...Wait a tick. Why are there still 11 episodes left?\\n\\n\r\n\"Oh right, there's still good money to make off this series. We can't end it just yet! Let's draw it out a bit longer... I dunno, pull some bullshit subplot out of nowhere. Just make some stuff up.\"\\n\\n\r\nIn a nutshell, Sore Arse Online managed to drag itself out. Another online game, Alfheim Online, manages to get involved in the plot, using some leftover technology from SAO. Kirito has to enter this game as well, along with his sister (who is actually his cousin, which somehow makes the romantic siscon undertones not as bad).\\n\\n\r\n...OK, I'll stop now. Anyway, the most generous thing I can say about his sister is that unlike Kirito and Asuna, she at least has a personality. For better or worse, since her personality is that of a completely insufferable melodramatic whining brat. She's not the only terrible character introduced in this arc, though... we also get the villainous mastermind behind Alfheim Online, who starts off overly and campily evil and just keeps getting more heinous from there. At every opportunity, the series will remind you that he is evil in new and terrible ways. You will quickly get the point, but SAO will keep shoving it down your throat. Even his eventual comeuppance is more uncomfortable than cathartic.\\n\\n\r\nSo there's SAO in four parts. It's an uneven, shifting, poorly-planned mess. It's characters are awful. It's plot is awful. It's pacing is awful. Short of it's decent production job, everything in SAO is awful.\\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend you stay offline.\\n\\n\r\nThat pun was awful.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Words: More like BORED ART ONLINE, amirite?\\n\\n\r\nStory/Plot: 1/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 2/10\\n\r\nAnimation/Art: 7/10\\n\r\nMusic: 7/10\\n\r\nActing: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nFor Fans Of: .Hack, Mirai Nikki",

            "content": "This is a review of Sword Art Online\u2019s adaptation. I do not care for the light novels, this review is based entirely on the anime adaptation. \r\nThe Story (4/10)\r\nThe plot for this anime falls below that of an average seasonal anime. Sword Art Online begins with a good, interesting premise. The first two episodes are actually very promising. However, once you get past those initial episodes the show doesn\u2019t really do anything of interest and feels like it was written by a sexually frustrated teenager. As I said, the concept is good and somewhat tragic. A new virtual reality MMO opens up and thousands ofplayers begin grinding away, only to find they cannot log out of the game and are stuck in this virtual world. There are so many possibilities and interesting things to be done with this premise. Sadly, it\u2019s all wasted. Forced romance, time skips, filler and a random love triangle plague this anime.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not that the story is dreadful, it\u2019s just that it was incredibly mediocre when there was so much to be done with it. Disappointing. And that\u2019s without mentioning the second half of the series, which is legitimately awful. Seriously, if you are going to waste your time on this show for whatever reason, just drop it when you get to the halfway point. You\u2019ll know when you\u2019re there. There\u2019s a load of bullshit, Gary Sue, rule-breaking nonsense. I could go on all day, but then I\u2019d have to give actual spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation (8/10)\\n\r\nVery solid, actually. High production value and nothing to complain about really. Other than the fact that this decently-sized budget was wasted on a terrible show. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nAhh, Kajiura Yuki. A shame his time was wasted on this tripe. Honestly, it\u2019s not one of his best works. It fit the on-screen stuff but nothing really stood out. The first opening by LiSA is great, however. Possibly the best thing to come of this series. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (2/10)\\n\\n\r\nNope, nope, nope. I can deal with silly characters like Yui from K-On. I can deal with whiney characters like Shinji. But the whole point of this main character is wish fulfilment. He\u2019s a self-insert; an antisocial, somewhat pathetic, MMO playing teenager. I\u2019m not sure if they were trying to make a character as close to the intended audience as possible, but they damn well succeeded. He\u2019s then somehow amazing and brilliant at the game purely because he did some beta testing. In fact, he even defies the rules of the game. The hard-coded rules matter not to this Gary Sue! He also becomes some sort of courageous leader, somehow. He changes in the series but there\u2019s no character development. He just kind of decides to be different. \\n\\n\r\nNow for the female cast. I\u2019m sorry, but how is this loser surrounded by attractive young women? Why are so many attractive young women even on this game? Way to ruin any suspension of disbelief. The female lead, Asuna, was perhaps the one character with some potential. Unfortunately, just like the premise of this show, the potential goes to waste and they turn what should have been a strong female lead into a damsel in distress. \\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion (4/10)\\n\\n\r\nThis series is below what I\u2019d consider average, even with the high production value. If the second cour never happened this might have been above average for me, but the latter half was just too awful. If you are the target audience for this show (a teenage male who enjoys playing MMOs) then you may very well like this series. It is watchable, and some episodes are pretty good. Think of this as the Twilight of anime; there are occasional good moments, but to actually enjoy the whole thing you need to be a specific type of person. \\n\\n\r\nI would not recommend this show to anyone outside of the aforementioned target audience. Those people will probably love this series, but to everyone else you\u2019ll probably feel that you\u2019ve wasted your time. Good premise ruined by childish wish fulfilment. \\n",

            "content": "--The review contains minor spoilers--\r\nSince I've seen a plethora of scores of 10 for this show, I thought I'd write what I feel is a more realistic review for this show. Sword Art Online is more or less the equivalent of a fanfiction in it's writing and quality. Whether people want to overlook it or not is up to the individual, but I believe it fails at the fundamentals for writing a good story. This review will go into details as to my opinions on why I feel this way. \r\n1) Story - This is first major problem is the show. Let's start from thebeginning shall we. The first arc consists of 14 episodes. The first 2 episodes are honestly pretty good and set up the plot of the show that should follow. You're introduced to the main characters and it shows mmo style of play. I mean with 2 episodes that are amazing, surely what follows will be more of the adventures of the main characters and these mmo boss fights...right? Wrong. What follows are 5 completely irrelevant side character episodes and unnecessary terrible time skips that ruin any sense of a story the first 2 episodes set up. So due to some illogical reason, we're now down to 7 episodes to tell the rest of this story. Still doable right? RIGHT? Wrong again. The series wastes another 2 1/2 episodes on pointless filler garbage. So there you have it over half of first part of the story has nothing to do with the overall plot. Well what about the other episodes you ask? The remaining \"plot\" episodes are filled with deus ex machina in its purest form. Even the finale of the first season makes absolutely no sense. This isn't a fantasy world, it's a freaking video game, you can't have miracles here. So that concludes my issues with season 1, which the majority of SAO fans consider to be the best part....Yeh you heard me, the 2nd part is even worse.\\n\r\n       Without going into spoilers, the 2nd part of the series takes place in a different setting, with a mostly new cast aside from our main hero. This part of the series probably deserves the award for most unnecessary story in the history of anime. This arc is pretty much a mario game. Our hero must save the princess in the castle. Not really much to say about it. Oh yeh deus ex machina finale here too...oh and there's an incest subplot...for some reason. This concludes the plot section. I think I'm being pretty generous with a 4 here. \\n\\n\r\n2) Art - The art is fantastic. Colorful characters, bosses (the few we see), and settings are all here. It's easily worth an 8.\\n\\n\r\n3) Sound - Again fantastic. Nothing wrong with it at all. 8.\\n\\n\r\n4)Characters - Here we go...This is easily the worst part of the series. I'll separate the main characters and lump together the not so main characters.\\n\\n\r\nKirito/Kazuto - The main character of this show is the epitome of the current definition of a \"Gary Stu\". He has no personality whatsoever. He is good at everything he tries for no reason. He's an amazing player, an super sleuth, a ladies man, and a master hacker. You name it, he can do it. There's no reason given for this other than he's just that good. Girls all love him, guys want to be him, and villains are jealous of him. He also solos MMO boss fights...yeh wrap your head around that one. Side note - I often see people claim they love this show because they're hardcore gamers. I have to say as an avid gamer myself I find this show to be insulting. Unless you've hacked or cheated , I don't understand why you're content with a character who does. Side note over. \\n\\n\r\nAsuna - The main female lead/most blatant waifu  character ever. Asuna is introduced as a strong player who can stand on her own with Kirito, that is for the first couple episodes. Once she reappears she barely does anything other than cook for Kirito. That's right, her ass stays in the kitchen, while Kirito does all the important stuff. In part 2 she does absolutely nothing...seriously. She again has no original personality...textbook Tsundere. \\n\\n\r\nYui - This character is terrible in all senses of the word. She's walking deus ex machina, nothing more. This character should be hated by any gamer, since she's a cheat device, who adds nothing to the story. \\n\\n\r\nVillains (minor spoilers) - There are 2 major villains in this series and they're both terrible. The first one forgets his motives for doing everything in part 1 and the part 2 one is so comically evil he can't even be taken seriously. \\n\\n\r\nOther Characters/ Who the hell cares - The female characters all want to have sex with Kirito and have no personality past this. The male characters don't get to do anything because Kirito hogs the show from everyone. That's really all there is to say about that.\\n\\n\r\nSuguha - This is Kirito's sister. She honestly has layers and was a plus to the show in my opinion. I don't know why she's in this show, she doesn't belong in it...\\n\\n\r\nSo yeh, Gary Stu and Waifu - these characters are pathetic (1).\\n\\n\r\n5) Enjoyment - Needless to say I didn't enjoy it. Poor show (3)\\n\\n\r\n6) Overall - This show has so many fans, and I really don't know why. Its plot is rushed and terrible. Its characters so flat, it's almost funny...almost. Its romance is highly misogynistic and terribly developed. I felt insulted watching this, and don't understand how any could like this show. Even Gamers.",

            "content": "I don't really want to go into too much depth, but I'd like to give an overview of the series and give my opinions it. If you haven't noticed yet there are many negative reviews out there for this anime, and while many of them bring up some pretty fair points, I think some people are being a bit too harsh on it. Let me explain. \r\nYes it's a popular anime, yes it has flaws, no it's not perfect, but at the very least in my opinion it is enjoyable. The pacing is off, the beginning particularly feels rushed, there were moments where I thoughtI skipped an episode because of the time skips which made it difficult to really connect with any of the characters in the beginning, and there were some less than stellar instances where it felt like the anime was trying to make me care but failing hard. \\n\\n\r\nSome characters felt to be completely forgotten throughout most of this series too. For example in the beginning we are introduced to a character named Klein who is quickly pushed aside after the first episode and barely seen again and doesn't really make much of an impact at all on the story later on. This seems to happen a lot throughout this series where there might be some emotional moments where a character dies, or something dramatic happens but there is really no emotional impact from it, and the main character seems to not really care that much about it or it doesn't really effect anything significantly.\\n\\n\r\nI really felt this series shined from around episodes 4-13 and I wish they would have kept with that pace instead of rushing an ending midway and throwing something new at us. The second half just felt completely unnecessary and forced. \\n\\n\r\nPushing the negative aside, I found the overall theme and atmosphere of the series to be great, and being an avid lover the MMORPG genre obviously a lot of things in this series appealed to me. I really enjoyed the idea of being stuck in a game that was impossible to escape from without winning and having real consequences, it really made everything much more dramatic and meaningful in the story. Sadly this quickly goes away midway through the plot. \\n\\n\r\nIf I had to pick two of the best things this anime did well for me it would probably be the animation and soundtrack. They both were really well done, and honestly without them being as good as they were this series would have gotten a much lower score from me, and when I say I really enjoyed the soundtrack I mean that I loved it, it was superb. \\n\\n\r\nI think what it really comes down was just the fact that I enjoyed watching it. I can look at the flaws and pick the anime apart pretty easily, but those flaws never really stopped me from enjoying this anime.I really do feel though that it had a lot of potential to be a top tier series, it just made far too many mistakes. Looking at it objectively I simply cannot give this anime higher than a 7. It was good because I found it to be enjoyable, but it wasn't great or amazing. \\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day I watch anime because I want something that will entertain me and keep me interested, and I feel that Sword Art Online did a good job at accomplishing that. \\n",

            "content": "Once upon a time, in a land far away, there lived a brave young boy. He was the best swordsman in the land and the manliest man of all. He overcame countless trials with little effort and won the hearts of many fair maidens.\r\nYes, it's time for Sword Art Online, the origin of many angry rants. \r\nThe premise doesn't sound too bad. Ten thousand players of a virtual MMO are trapped in the game and forced to complete it to escape, except that death in the game leads to death in real life. Just think about it: this could be a tragic story of strugglewhere death is behind every corner. A story of sacrifice and despair. A story of alliances and betrayal. A story of the struggle to retain humanity in front of impossible conditions. \\n\\n\r\n...But why have any of that when you can have romance and harem?\\n\\n\r\nThat's right; the survival game is just for show. Don't expect deep interpersonal or political conflict. Don't expect psychology or moral dilemmas. Don't expect tactics or mind games. Actually, don't expect witty dialogue of any kind.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that is the biggest problem with this show. It is bankrupt in substance. It's mostly just uninspired romance and harem, with a bit of action here and there. There isn't much thinking involved. A few plot holes I could forgive, but if the show isn't about anything worthwhile, there isn't much to do. What makes this problem all the more apparent is that the premise promises something entirely different than what it delivers. The show has thrown its hands up in the air and said, \"We don't care.\" So why should the viewer? \\n\\n\r\nIt doesn't help that the show has grown infamous for glorifying its protagonist, who in the eyes of many has become the epitome of a Gary Stu. He can defeat anything, he can solve any problem, and he gets all the girls. It's almost like this show was meant to be a propaganda piece in his favor.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3\\n\\n\r\nThe first two episodes are decent, building up the premise. We are introduced to the protagonist Kirito and the concept of the death game. Soon enough, we are told that a month has passed and two thousand players have died offscreen. ...Wait, not even a short montage or anything? Apparently not. Anyway, these two episodes are pretty much the only decent ones, so savor them while you can.\\n\\n\r\nThe third episode begins to show more serious problems. We are supposed to form an emotional bond to new characters in a few minutes, and we have to go through over-the-top angst over irrational actions. But there is also optimism in the air; of course we can revive someone whose brain has been fried, right?\\n\\n\r\nWhat follows is an abrupt leap to harem and romance antics. The next few episodes are about various girls suddenly falling for Kirito, often the same day they met him. This typically involves uncontrollable blushing, fanservice, and people acting Tsundere. You probably get the picture. It doesn't help that many of these episodes have a very filler-esque feel to them. The main plot \u2012 if you can call it such at this point \u2012 takes a backseat in favor of these random new girls. \\n\\n\r\nThe girl called Asuna, who quickly becomes the token love interest for Kirito, has at least met him before, but there is still very little buildup to their relationship. Unless it took place offscreen. You see, another thing that becomes very noticeable is the pacing. There have been timeskips of months between episodes. This wouldn't be a problem if these snapshots contained all the events that were critical to the story, but it's obvious that the author has picked rather boring events out of all the possibilities. Why is it that thousands of people dying is covered in a few lines, while we have to sit through hours and hours of romance and harem? I hate to be beating a dead horse here, but it's unavoidable because it comes up again in just about every episode.\\n\\n\r\nBy now, it has also become obvious to the viewer that Kirito is invincible to the point of tedium. He has a level higher than anyone, the best equipment, and a seemingly endless pool of abilities, but most importantly he always wins. There is sometimes false tension, sure, but you know he will survive anyway. You can only stomach so many clutch survivals before you start rolling your eyes.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the story arc involves Kirito and Asuna hanging out in the countryside to spend their honeymoon. They even adopt a daughter to portray a typical happy family. The problem is that their relationship is really not that interesting. But \"dem feels\"! Nah, sorry. I have a heart of stone. \\n\\n\r\nThis is followed by a sudden confrontation with the main villain, which Kirito wins because the power of love conquers all. And by that I mean the power of love conquers the programming of the game. Well, okay, maybe there was some \"power of love\" clause in the code somewhere. It wouldn't surprise me at this point.\\n\\n\r\nPredictably enough, melodrama ensues. Tears, promises of love, etc. You can probably imagine. At least now we're done with this show, right?\\n\\n\\n\r\nNo, think again, that was only the good part. There are actually 11 more episodes left, and the journey takes us further downhill. We enter another game, this time without the death aspect. Before we get to the plot itself, even at a glance this idea brings up a few problems.\\n\\n\r\nThe harsh reality hits you faster than you can say \"cashcow.\" This second arc feels completely unnecessary. It has been tied into the original story with an overly convenient plot device for no apparent purpose other than stretching it further. At least know to quit while you're ahead. But no, they just had to drag this show through the mud to rip apart any shred of dignity it had left.\\n\\n\r\nIt doesn't help that there is no death anymore. While this makes the slice-of-life content more fitting, it also removes the established selling point of the show. The change is too abrupt, and the difference in tone is too jarring. If you want to make a slice-of-life of ordinary MMO players, do it from the start. \\n\\n\r\nNow, for the plot itself, and it isn't pretty. We go straight to a Mario game, by which I mean saving a damsel in distress trapped in a cage. And that isn't a metaphor; she is quite literally trapped in a cage. Add tentacles and incest to the plot, and you have a winning combination. The incest aspect is provided by Kirito's sister Suguha, who also provides additional fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nAt least now the pacing is less erratic and there is seemingly less development taking place offscreen. It's just too bad that there is also very little meaningful taking place onscreen. There are some new characters and even an ingame war going on, but it's all so irrelevant to the main story that it's hard to maintain interest. \\n\\n\r\nLong story short, Kirito beats the second villain with the help of more deus ex machinas. There are also more tears, promises of love, etc.\\n\\n\r\nSo now we're done, right? For now, yes, but there's still season 2 to look forward to. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSetting:\\n\\n\r\nThis is technically part of the story category, but I really think it deserves its own section here. You see, the very foundations of the setting make no sense. People in Sword Art Online are too often acting like they are in a normal game, not in a life-and-death scenario.\\n\\n\r\nFor instance, why is there so much resentment towards beta testers who have greater knowledge of the game? This isn't a competition; the faster someone beats the game, the faster everyone gets out. And, similarly, why are beta testers reluctant to share information? Are they so worried about other people using their newfound abilities to kill them for no reason? Look, you can't have both a casual slice-of-life of MMO players and a grim death game at the same time. Pick one. \\n\\n\r\nThis casual attitude becomes more pronounced later on when it becomes obvious people are wasting tons of time with unproductive quests, romance, and just hanging around. Kirito himself spends time on seemingly useless sidequests, and Asuna spends time cooking for him. Come to think of it, why has Asuna wasted points on a useless skill like cooking in the first place? Are these people even trying?\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnd why are so many players dying when towns are safe zones? Are they stupidly rushing into high-level dungeons? I suppose so. You see, for a grim death game it sure is hard to die in SAO. Bosses won't respawn, so everyone can advance forward, even weak players. Going from town to town is also easy enough with teleport crystals. Well, okay, there is that problem of challenging people to a duel while asleep, but that can't take out so many. \\n\\n\r\nThere is no lack of critical resources because you can hang out in the safety of towns indefinitely. Sure, exp and money are limited because the regeneration of monsters is limited, which is strange game design itself, but they aren't necessary if you stay in town. At least, the show never implies that they are necessary. Oh, and for the record, I'm treating the show as self-contained and ignoring the source material. \\n\\n\r\nSo why do they die? I'd put my money on rushing stupidly into dungeons because we get to see one notable example.\\n\\n\r\nLet's imagine you found yourself in the following situation. Before you and your guild are about to enter a high-level dungeon, you learn that one of them lied about his level. Knowing this, you realize you are underleveled and likely to end up dead, while avoiding death and warning the others would be as simple as staying in town.\\n\\n\r\nWhat would you do? Would you\\n\r\na) Record a message in advance, knowing that you wouldn't last long, or\\n\r\nb) Stay in town so that you wouldn't get killed in the first place?\\n\\n\r\nA tricky one, I admit.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWe are also introduced to groups of player killers. Sounds good until you realize this isn't a normal game. At least, I thought it wasn't, but it looks like some people didn't get the memo. In a situation like SAO, there should be no reason for these killings. This isn't Danganronpa, where the main point of the premise is that you can only escape by killing someone. This is a game where it makes the most sense to team up and beat the game. There is no prisoner's dilemma; cooperation is the best plan and any sensible person would go for it. \\n\\n\r\nIf you kill someone here, you only get some money and equipment. While it may help you beat the game a little faster, odds are that it will only hurt your chances of survival overall. Just off the top of my head, a few reasons: \\n\r\n1) If people start killing each other, it obviously increases the risk of dying yourself, both in retaliation and spontaneously.\\n\r\n2) Killing people reduces manpower needed for beating the game, and the distrust that follows will make it even slower. You could only kill useless low-level players, but they probably don't have much money or good equipment to begin with. \\n\r\n3) There is the chance that you will land murder charges if you escape from the game and officials find out.\\n\\n\r\nActually, does the equipment even help that much? Kirito seemingly uses the same equipment for long periods of time, yet he is practically invincible. On the other hand, he does say that equipment can be worth many levels, so did he get the best stuff for himself so fast? Is it strange game design or cheat codes? It's anyone's guess.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, if you have little interest in beating the game, killing other players makes more sense, if only a little. I suppose getting more money can help you obtain some luxury items, but is it worth the risk? The implied reason is that they are killing people for laughs, but why did so many murderous psychopaths decide to log into this MMO on its opening day? Is this some kind of stab at gamers, saying that they are unable to distinguish between real violence and fake violence? Maybe, or the author forgot that this isn't a normal MMO. Again.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo is it a legit plan to stay in the virtual world for the rest of your life and give up on getting back to the real world? If so, it would explain a lot. While the range of pastimes in there is smaller than in the real world, maybe there is enough for some people. \\n\\n\r\nThe choice between staying in relative happiness in a virtual world and risking your life returning to the real world could have been an interesting one. Unfortunately, their bodies are deteriorating in real life, which makes the choice very one-sided. For some reason, Asuna has to point this out to Kirito because apparently the state of his real-world body had never occurred to him over the course of two years. Yeah, good job, Kirito, you sure were fast on the uptake. Lying down on the grass and having a carefree nap doesn't sound so smart anymore, eh? \\n\\n\\n\r\nFinally, why are virtual MMOs still legal after the SAO incident? Sure, the new hardware is supposedly safer, but the previous death trap must have equally passed through \"strict\" government examination, so who in their right mind would trust them? And even if we assume it is safe, since when has people's hysteria hinged on facts? People fear new technology even when it's harmless, let alone when a massive incident like this happens. There would be mass protests in the streets in favor of banning them.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2\\n\\n\r\nYou may have noticed that I have only mentioned three characters by name so far. For some other show, this might be because the cast is so vast that there is no time to go through them all, but here it's rather that there are very few characters worth mentioning. Kirito, and by extension Asuna and Suguha who are defined by Kirito's character, hog practically all of the screentime. \\n\\n\r\nEveryone else gets thrown under the bus. Girls only exist to fall in love with Kirito, and males only exist to be inferior to him. The villains in particular only exist as fodder to the guy.\\n\\n\\n\r\nKirito:\\n\\n\r\nI have barely touched on Kirito's personality. Well, blame the show, not me; it should at least be willing to meet me halfway. We know very little about him, other than being invincible and inexplicably good with the ladies. Essentially, he is the manliest man on the planet.\\n\\n\r\nThat's pretty much all he is. Even his dialogue ends up pretty bland. There are no witty insights, no clever jokes, no skillful word games. Much of his dialogue consists of saying that the world is a virtual one, explaining game mechanics, wishing to save everyone, or loving someone forever. The sort of stuff you'd expect from a cardboard cutout hero in a situation like this. \\n\\n\r\nIt can be a facepalm-worthy experience to witness girl after girl falling for Kirito like nothing, often the same day they met him. The show endlessly drills into the viewer that he is the sexiest man alive... for some reason. I get that rescuing people can give you points in their eyes, but come on now. I can only assume there is a hidden manliness stat and his black jacket comes with a +999 boost.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as his invincibility goes, the win streak by itself isn't the biggest problem. The problem is that he always wins through brute strength. That is to say, his character skills and stats. There are no tactics worth mentioning, no psychology, no politics, no thinking whatsoever. He will just go out there and pull off his generic action hero stunts. Sure, developing those skills and stats may have required some tactical thinking. Maybe he has optimized his skill tree or has amazing grinding strats. In theory. We see no hints of it. It all happened offscreen and offscreen doesn't count. I'm sorry, it just doesn't. \\n\\n\r\nTo add insult to injury, some of Kirito's abilities are completely forgotten later on. I'm sure that health recovery thing would have come in handy any number of times. And when even his skills and stats aren't enough, he is saved by plot armor at the last second.\\n\\n\r\nIt's also a mockery of MMOs in the sense that Kirito is able to solo raid bosses. And he is able to attain a level higher than anyone despite playing solo, supposedly because he doesn't have to split the exp. His most unique ability is revealed to be... *drumroll* dual-wielding, which nobody else is allowed to do in this game. This doesn't sound like any MMO I know of, or was the idea to portray a player with god-mode cheats on?\\n\\n\r\nI'm seriously thinking that the show would have been a lot more tolerable if Kirito alone had been replaced by one of the side characters. It still wouldn't have been a masterpiece or anything, but at least the Gary Stu accusations could have been avoided.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAsuna:\\n\\n\r\nShe is about as bland in personality as Kirito. She is also portrayed as fairly powerful for no substantial reason but of course nothing compared to him. As time passes, her most notable trait becomes being a textbook Tsundere.\\n\\n\r\n...Well, that was fast. Moving on.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSuguha:\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned earlier, her main role is providing fanservice and a tacked-on incest subplot. It's simply another element thrown into the plot for cheap shock value, if anyone is still shocked by incest in anime nowadays.\\n\\n\\n\r\nVillain #1:\\n\\n\r\nThe first villain barely appears, and his motivation for trapping the players is vague, to say the least. He basically did it out of personal interest. He wanted to create a virtual world where death has meaning like in the real one, but as for why he was interested in the idea, he forgot. Err, alright then. Moving on.\\n\\n\\n\r\nVillain #2:\\n\\n\r\nThe second villain is pathetic and a disgrace to antagonists everywhere, coming across as a cartoon villain who does evil things for the sake of being evil. The conflict here is portrayed as completely black-and-white, just in case someone had sympathy for the guy, as unlikely as that is. \\n\\n\r\nHis main focus is essentially raping a comatose girl. And that is over obtaining tons of cash, presumably in the millions. If he had left the girl alone, he probably would have got away with it, so for all intents and purposes, he chose raping a girl over millions in cash. Talk about priorities. \\n\\n\r\nCome to think of it, it's already ridiculous that the family of the comatose girl is planning to have her marry the guy. I mean, she is in a coma. As in unconscious, unable to state her own intentions, etc. Where are child protective services when you need them? Thankfully, the law disagrees, so they can't apply for an official marriage. Instead, he'll be adopted by her family as their son in spirit... Wait, what? \\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, his sheer incompetence is mindboggling. He openly explains his evil plans and his security is practically at Dr. Evil level, up to entering a secret keycode in plain sight so that the prisoner can see. Thankfully the government and his company are equally incompetent and are not monitoring his research group closely despite its reliance on infamous technology used in SAO. Are these the same people who deemed the new tech safe? If so, I'd like a second opinion. I wouldn't trust these people to operate Angry Birds, let alone a virtual MMO with potential health risks. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\\n\r\nSo this is where the money went. The backgrounds look nice but cheap fanservice scenes not so much. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\\n\r\nNot too bad either. The soundtrack and opening and ending songs work pretty decently, and the voices are also alright.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\\n\r\nFunnier than I was expecting but for the wrong reasons. There is something earnest about how the show is trying to portray escapism and human relationships, but it falls just short enough to create a dissonance.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3\\n\\n\r\nWatch it to witness the writing yourself. But more importantly, by watching the show you can better understand the reviews or, better yet, write one yourself.",

            "content": "Once in a while, there comes along a title (be it movie, book or anime) that takes the audience by storm, sweeping numerous off their feat, leaving several with a bad aftertaste in their mouth and making a few pass the work off  as \u2018average\u2019 or \u2018mediocre\u2019. Online communities, forums, chat rooms and every other nook and corner of the internet known to the man turn into arenas of debates, discussions, fanboyism/fangirlism and flaming. It\u2019s apparent that when something is popular, it doesn\u2019t always get to bath in praises. With the acclaim, comes a sheer amount of criticisms. Also, it goes without saying thatpopularity doesn\u2019t necessarily equate to quality. \\n\\n\r\nSword Art Online, abbreviated as SAO from this point on, is no exception.   \\n\\n\r\nSAO, the anime adaptation of a series of light novels of the same name by Kawahara Reki, has been the much talked about show of the Summer and Fall 2012 seasons, and taking into consideration the incredible hype surrounding it with reviews of mixed sorts, it\u2019s likely to stay that way for quite some time. Keeping in mind the vogue of MMORPGs and the demand for something \u2018captivating\u2019, the team behind SAO attempts to bring an enticing work to the table by executing the intriguing premise of \u2018players trapped in a VRMMORPG where death equates to death in real life and the only way out is to clear the game\u2019. Unfortunately, SAO fails at many levels which is a shame because when the anime kicked off with the highly anticipated first episode, all seemed well and it gave the vibes of something truly worth spending your time on but then it does a flip and from this point, things go awry. And here we have it\u2014 one of the most controversial anime of the recent years. \\n\\n\r\nBefore proceeding with the review, let\u2019s get one thing straight. I have not read the original source material\u2014 the light novels, that is. Hence, I\u2019m not going to draw any comparison between that and the anime. With that out of the way, let\u2019s keep the ball rolling.  \\n\\n\r\nSAO on the surface has a fairly interesting premise, no doubt, and it\u2019s executed well to some extent or so did it initially seem. The very idea of a large number of people logged into a VRMMORPG with the intention of embarking on a virtual reality adventure but only to be struck with utter horror as they\u2019re faced with the shocking truth of the game has been put into effect quite satisfactorily in the first episode. It\u2019s pretty much what I\u2019d call an excellent start. However, SAO effortlessly manages to send all my expectations and enthusiasm down the drain for it takes the show only an episode or two to reveal its true colours followed by the disappointment it has in store.  \\n\\n\r\nSo, what goes wrong? Well, many things.  \\n\\n\r\nFollowing the Great Beginning, the first arc decides to take a detour and invests on a few episodes dealing with side stories in which our protagonist Kirito gets acquainted with one girl per episode and ends up rescuing her from a jam. This is precisely why I like referring to this bunch of side stories as \u2018episodic harem\u2019 wherein the primary heroine of the story and Kirito\u2019s love interest Asuna is assumed to be constant and the other girls are variables. Now this isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. However, these side stories have very little to nothing to contribute to the series as a whole. Admittedly, they equip the viewers with some clever, little details here and there regarding how the game world works but they hardly have any bearing to the overall plot. The primary goal of these filler-like episodes appears to be that of giving our hero clad in black an opportunity to flaunt how much of a chick magnet he is and how he has it all that takes to be the coolest dude in this world made up of zillions of pixels. To boot, the characters (read: cute chicks) that appear in these episodes have absolutely no substantial role to play in the story later on. \u2018Side\u2019 characters indeed. And SAO knows how to effectively sideline them. \\n\\n\r\nWhen the arc finally gets itself back on track, it\u2019s only natural to hope that the show will now have something worthwhile to deliver. However, that isn\u2019t the case. If anything, some severe cracks begin to appear as very soon the focus of SAO is the romance between the two leads which is, in one word, cheesy. At this point, opinions are divided. The romance aspect, for some, can be appealing while for others, it can be a major turn off especially if they don\u2019t like the characters involved. It all comes down to personal preference. However, personal preferences aren\u2019t a convincing excuse by any means to overlook the fact that the story, world building and everything else take a backseat for the sake of allowing the two leads to be lovey-dovey in the backdrop of gorgeous sceneries. When the arc does manage to divert its focus on to some \u2018serious business\u2019, things look good for a while but with a rather unimpressive ending, the first arc concludes on a pretty bad note in my book.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd then begins the second arc which, to be blunt, is a letdown again. \\n\\n\r\nThe second arc or the ALO arc is set within ALfheim Online, a VRMMORPG successor to SAO. Kirito logs in with a mission to rescue his wife (Asuna, duh) from the clutches of an archetypical antagonist who is a disgrace to all the villains in fiction we have come across so far. This arc showcases some really eye candy visuals but that\u2019s pretty much its only redeeming point. It doesn\u2019t have anything much going on except for a few climactic action sequences now and then with intense battle music playing in the background that last only for a while. Not to mention, there\u2019s another girl added to Kirito\u2019s harem.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd then the hilarity ensues.  \\n\\n\r\nThe manner in which ALO is brought to a close is appalling to say the least and at the same laughable because it doesn\u2019t hesitate to use the much notorious plot device dues ex machina, ruining whatever hopes there were for the final confrontation with the villain. The poor conclusion could be excused if it was handled more cleverly and convincingly but a blatant ass pull is by no means satisfactory. If anything, it only proves that the writer faced a dead end and was unable to think of anything better and creative, and expected the audience to swallow down whatever he could come up with, no matter how downright stupid it is.  \\n\\n\r\nAmong all the other things, the most easily noticeable flaw without a doubt is the execution of the plot itself which is all over the place. It doesn\u2019t take a genius to figure out after a couple of episodes that SAO suffers from poor pacing and inconsistency. It appears to be highly indecisive as to what exactly it wants to do and how to get it done. This is mostly evident in the first arc which is incredibly rushed at many parts. There\u2019re timeskips and the next thing you realize is that the characters have already cleared quite a lot of floors while keeping us, the viewers, in the dark. This makes the plot disjointed, prevents any sort of correlation to the win-or-die situation that the characters have been put into and gives everything the feel of it being nothing more than a piece of cake. The struggle for survival and a sense of urgency are hardly felt even though the lives of the characters have been said to be literally at stake. The episodes dealing exclusively with the lead couple taking some time off for a \u2018vacation\u2019 and subsequently ending up building a virtual family can further make one wonder: Why are they so carefree when they\u2019re supposed to chalk out plans to beat the game and make a quick escape? To put it in other words, the arc has a tendency to go off track. It lays down for itself one thing but ends up doing something else altogether. It\u2019s uncertain as to whether to make itself come across as a story of survival set within a VRMMORPG or as a fluffy love story. In due course, it decides to juggle with both but doesn\u2019t get either of them rightly done. Not to mention, when the situation demands it and the writer goes out of any creative ideas to move the story forward, the characters\u2019 actions are made to contradict the established game mechanics and the only reasoning that\u2019s provided for such miracles is \u2018where there\u2019s a will, there\u2019s a way, and there\u2019re times when true love and determination can overcome any obstacle in the game\u2019.  \\n\\n\r\nNow, for those who look for substance in any given story, it\u2019s almost a fact that no amount of fanservice, eye candies, self-insertion or guilty pleasure factors can possibly compensate for a substandard storytelling. Yet that\u2019s what SAO tries to do. It brings in all the aforementioned elements to sugarcoat its sloppy writing. On the whole, there\u2019re no sincere efforts made to incorporate details that would contribute in some way or the other to world building or characterization whatsoever.  \\n\\n\r\nWhile the poor quality of the writing is the key factor, the other aspect that contributes considerably to the mediocrity of the show is the characterization. Simply put, SAO\u2019s characters are bland. Essentially, the show has its focus on only two characters: Kirito and Asuna. The others are just there; mere devices to move the story forward. And a few have nothing to contribute to the plot at all. For instance, the ones featuring in the side stories. \\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s talk about the protagonist Kirito first.  \\n\\n\r\nAn unsocial, reserved yet headstrong player who knows how to get things done his way and is determined to beat the game. That\u2019s basically how Kirito is portrayed in the beginning. At this point, he seems like a good riddance from the generic wimpy male leads that have become so much of a commonplace in anime. A proficient main character who knows how to deal with things is something refreshing to witness once in a while. Unfortunately, the impressions didn\u2019t last for long. In desperate attempts to make his character more \u2018appealing\u2019, Kirito is depicted as a \u2018perfect\u2019 being which leaves his character with little plausibility and much insipidity. \\n\r\nHe\u2019s a guy with a heart of gold. \\n\r\nHe has an \u2018ideal\u2019 girlfriend/wife.\\n\r\nHe\u2019s admired by those around him. \\n\r\nHe can \u2018unintentionally\u2019 make every other woman adore him, romantically or otherwise.  \\n\\n\r\nThus, he serves as a mere self-insert character for wish-fulfilment and at the end of the day, there\u2019s nothing \u2018individualistic\u2019 about him. Gary stu is probably what describes his character the best, and if paired with the Mary sue of the show, we get a lead couple that seems to have been cut out straight from a tacky romance fanfiction.  \\n\\n\r\nYes, when I mentioned \u2018Mary sue\u2019, I was referring to Asuna. \\n\\n\r\nAsuna as the female lead is as stereotyped as they come. Much like Kirito, her character is heavily idealized. She\u2019s pretty, popular, kind, caring and every other man wants to have a piece of her. Oh, and did I mention her cooking skills that level up with each passing day? After all, her foremost duty is to cook for Kirito and show how much she cares for him. While initially she\u2019s portrayed as a strong, independent female player with a tsundere-ish attitude, it doesn\u2019t take her long to make a transition from that to a deplorable damsel in distress, requiring her knight in black robe to come to her rescue whenever she\u2019s in a bind. Kirito fighting her guild leader to earn her some time for honeymooning is laughable to say the least. It soon becomes apparent that she doesn\u2019t have much of a role other than serving as the love interest of the protagonist and being the object of fanservice now and then which might be successful in pleasing the male audience somehow but that alone can\u2019t make up for her badly written character. In fact, the other female character the show cares to put the spotlight on also ends up becoming the target of fanservice but doesn\u2019t have anything else going on for herself.  \\n\\n\r\nIf you haven\u2019t guessed it already, I\u2019m talking about Kirito\u2019s beloved imouto. \\n\\n\r\nThroughout the first arc, the writer must have had been itching to include a love triangle in the story but couldn\u2019t find a potential candidate to get the job done. As the first arc comes to a closure and the second arc begins, he grabs the opportunity, puts Asuna behind the bars (so that she\u2019s not an interference in what he\u2019s attempting to do) and introduces Suguha, Kirito\u2019s cousin sister. The sole purpose of creating her character, it appears, is to make way for a generic love triangle and melodrama. Suguha loves her cousin but can\u2019t do anything about it because he loves Asuna. That\u2019s the bitter truth. Hence, she looks up to a certain someone she happens to befriend within ALO and hopes that he\u2019d be able to sooth her aching heart. However, she gets trolled\u2026 badly. This, in turn, leads to more drama that\u2019s somehow supposed to be heart wrenching but it isn\u2019t.  \\n\\n\r\nThe remaining cast consists of two antagonists, both failing to make any sort of impression though the one making his debut in the second arc can be a good comic relief at times, and a bunch of side characters that wouldn\u2019t have had made any difference even if they hadn\u2019t existed. The bottom line is, the characters of SAO are a half-baked lot devoid of any depth or development. They could\u2019ve perhaps turned out to be interesting if they were more fleshed out but who cares about that as long as they appeal to the intended target audience?  \\n\\n\r\nOnto the technical aspects now.  \\n\\n\r\nIn the department of visuals, A-1 Pictures does a pretty good job. Within the game, the vast tracts of greenery, the beautiful cities during the night, the castles\u2026 they\u2019re all a pleasure to behold. The animation is also well-handled for the most part. Initially I wasn\u2019t much pleased with the character designs but they gradually grew on me, and I personally find a few characters like Asuna, Heathcliff and Lisbeth to be very well designed.  \\n\\n\r\nThe music is composed by one of the most renowned composers in the anime industry, Yuki Kajiura. While the soundtracks aren\u2019t bad by any means, none of them stand out much except the one that plays during combat/intense scenes. In fact, that\u2019s the only track that can be heard playing most of the time in the entire show. A few other tracks, though they aptly fit the scenes they\u2019re played in, are easily forgettable. The same applies to the opening and ending themes. Nothing groundbreaking there. I\u2019m a fan of almost all of Kajiura\u2019s works and if compared to her previous works, SAO\u2019s music is lacklustre to say the least and so much so that it\u2019s hard to believe Kajiura is the composer to begin with. \\n\\n\r\nTo wrap up the review, SAO had the potential to be something good but that potential goes down the drain due to poorly executed plot and bland characterization. It starts off in a satisfactory manner but goes downhill thereafter. Nevertheless, it can be an entertaining ride if one keeps their expectations low and swallows down whatever it has to offer without questioning anything. One of the reasons why SAO has been a letdown is the anticipation the majority had for it prior to its airing but that\u2019s justified since the light novel series from which the anime is adapted is one of the most popular ones out there.  \\n\\n\r\n[Edited on March 20, 2017]",

            "content": "Sword Art Online, aka The Twilight Saga for Teenage Boys.\r\nIn the beginning, Sword Art Online (SAO) looked like it could have turned out to be the best show of the year, no exaggeration. The premise of being stuck and unable to log out of a virtual reality MMO with the condition that dying in the game means you die in real life and the only way out is to clear all 100 floors was set up extremely well in the first episode. The second episode continued this with the first boss fight, supported by well-done animation and Yuki Kajiura's amazing-as-always score. At this point, hopeswere high.\\n\\n\r\nBut it didn't last.\\n\\n\r\nThe following few episodes were side stories from the original novel that have little to do with the overall plot. On their own, none of these are all that bad, but together they become rather tedious and ridiculous, especially when you realize that the focus of each one is the main character, Kirito, befriending and helping a cute girl (despite the fact that the female playerbase is said to only be 10%), and in more than half the cases, said girl getting attached to Kirito in more than a \"friendly\" way. And these characters, if they appear later at all, never again play a significant role.\\n\\n\r\nThese episodes would have worked better if they'd been placed throughout the series between story arcs - though it later becomes apparent that this would not actually work - or released separately as OVAs or DVD specials. The best thing to be said about them is that they help to give the game world some more depth since they explain some game mechanics and show viewers how the various groups of players are going about playing the game, but the information is mostly superfluous and could have easily been given to us through the main story. Not that any of it ever gets used again anyway.\\n\\n\r\nThen the main story continues and things get...worse.\\n\\n\r\nIt's at this point that an idea starts developing that perhaps the writer of the novels merely had a good idea for a story but didn't know what to do with it past the premise. The above-mentioned side stories were included when they were because the show is being broadcast in chronological order; when the main story picks back up, it's been two years since the last main story episode. Bonds between characters have been formed off-screen and over the half the game has already been cleared.\\n\\n\r\nWhat a rip-off.\\n\\n\r\nBefore continuing with the story, let's look at the characters. We have our protagonist Kirito, a solo player who knows his way around the game fairly well as a result of having been a beta tester for the game. Okay, this is cool. We don't need 12 episodes of training to become the best in every show, a strong-from-the-start MC is fine. But that's not quite what Kirito is. Kirito is portrayed as essentially perfect in every way; he never loses a (fair) fight, he always has a solution, and all the chicks dig him. Basically, Kirito is a Gary Stu, a self-insert wish-fulfillment character with no true substance (have you heard of that before, anime fans?). He even gets a special ability not given to any other player just because he's that awesome.\\n\\n\r\nNow let's look at Asuna, the only other character the show actually cares about. She is initially portrayed as a strong, individual female who has abilities on par with the male characters. Again, this was good at first. But it quickly becomes clear that she only exists as otaku bait. She's extremely popular and beautiful and all the guys want her...but she only wants Kirito. And despite the fact that she is supposedly a strong player, she's treated more like a prize than a teammate; Kirito literally fights for her freedom from her guild more than once. Yeah, she can't even earn her own freedom for some vacation time after all the work she's been putting in for the past two years. Sexist much? No MMO guild leader would actually be this anal, but hey, we need to make Kirito look awesome somehow.\\n\\n\r\nAnd really, that's all Asuna is here for: to enhance Kirito's badass status. When he almost dies, she's there to cling to him and cry for him. When Kirito needs to look awesome, she's put in some kind of trouble and he gets her out of it. She also cooks for him because her cooking level is so high because hey, your waifu needs to cook for you, Kirito.\\n\\n\r\nTailor Twilight so that it appeals to boys instead of girls and send your awful fanfic to the printing press. Sword Art Online has been born.\\n\\n\r\nNo, I'm not joking. Screw action, screw plot, cue romance. SAO skips out on all the floor-clearing and boss-killing and decides to just have its main characters play house and do character development backwards. Nothing is believable about the relationship between these two characters. We see no real development between them since the show kind of just drops us into the middle of things after those useless side stories are over. And this is the focus for multiple episodes. Lots of cheesy, lovey-dovey dialogue, hand-holding, and sleeping is what we're fed. It's an otaku wish-fulfillment, folks; you're in a medieval world, you're the strongest person around, the cute girls all want you, and you don't have to work because magic (game mechanics) supplies everything.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and breast-groping. Can't forget the blatant fanservice!\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I praised the show for at first was that it seemed like an accurate portrayal of what a virtual reality MMO would actually be like. But, as usual, SAO managed to crap on itself. The whole \"beater\" concept, a combination of the words \"beta\" for beta testers and \"cheater,\" is laughably ridiculous and would never happen and obviously only exists to antagonize certain groups of players and give Kirito even more attention. We also see a group of players acting as an \"army\" of sorts going around forcing other players to pay taxes, even attacking an in-game daycare (LOL) in order to collect; this is dumb. Once again, a way to make Kirito and Asuna look like such sugoi people for helping out the needy children. Somewhere along the line the writer decided to make this a pseudo-medieval setting, taking what he wanted from the medieval era and what he wanted from MMO mechanics and not caring how they would make sense with each other. It's even written in the novel and alluded to in the anime that characters can have sex (but can't get pregnant, because that's no fun). Now that's taking cyber-sex to a whole new level. What would our wish-fulfillment world be without it?\\n\\n\r\nBut before too long we get to the climax of the first main arc, and after a couple miracles and deus ex machinas we can very clearly see that the author had no damn clue what he was going to do with his story after he had the premise down. The promise that was made to us has been broken and we, the viewers, are left with one of the most soulless shows to ever hit the airwaves. Any generic battle shounen at least gives us the action it promises and has better developed relationships and themes of friendship. Any generic harem at least knows it's dumb and only exists to appeal to that niche group of otaku who still enjoy it. SAO is a lie, a cheat, a traitor, and is worse than either of those. SAO wants you to believe it's good and smart, but it's so bad it doesn't even manage to achieve So Bad It's Good status. It's just terrible.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now we're at the start of a new arc. Things...don't look any better. Kirito has added a new member to his harem in the form of a busty little sister/cousin (emphasis on that bust), because we needed some imouto fetish-fuel in here. Our antagonist is about as generic and stereotypical as they come, but that kind of fits because our new plot is about as generic and stereotypical as they come.\\n\\n\r\nI've spent a lot of time on characters and plot without mentioning technical aspects because the technical aspects, no matter how good they are, really just won't change anything. They're there, and they're good; really, there's nothing wrong with them. Kajiura's music, when noticeable, is great and enhances the few good scenes the show has. The animation is also good. But neither is really amazing enough to be notable, so in the end, they just can't save a terrible piece of work.\\n\\n\r\nAnd Sword Art Online is a downright terrible piece of work.\\n\\n\r\nBreakdown:\\n\r\nStory - 2/10: Good premise, atrocious execution.\\n\r\nArt - 8/10: It looks nice.\\n\r\nSound - 7/10: Yuki Kajiura.\\n\r\nCharacter - 1/10: There are no characters in this anime.\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 3/10: It's fun to criticize.\\n\r\nOverall - 2/10.",

            "content": "Well then. SAO is indisputably one of the most polarizing anime in recent memory. It has devout fans who think it's one of the greatest, haters who think it's trash, and a minority that just says \"hey guys, can't we all just have different opinions?\" I hate the first and last groups with a fiery passion. I feel like breaking down why I think it's awful, so I'm writing a review. Let\u2019s get into it, shall we?\r\nStory:\r\nThe premise was a somewhat generic one, and \u201ctrapped in a video game\u201d has been done numerous times before, but SAO seemed promising. And then the plot did everythingwrong. It utilizes time skips to avoid character development and many important events happen off screen and are never mentioned again or properly explained. Once Kirito was in a seemingly impossible to escape situation, but it just skipped to after he survived without ever explaining how he managed it. Because, I guess, that's not as important as filler episodes about Kirito resurrecting some irrelevant bitch's bird thingy. \\n\\n\r\nIt lacks any amount of tension due to the main character having invincible plot armor and LE EPIC DUBBLE SWORDZ. I'm confused by the point of the double swords. Why was that his special thing? No one else was capable of putting another sword in their other hand? I mean, Jesus, if you're going to give the main character an overpowered weapon at least be creative. The funny thing is that although dual wielding was supposed to be Kirito's unique ability and this idea was drilled into our minds time and time again, other characters are shown dual wielding on several occasions. They seriously put no effort into this series. \\n\\n\r\nThe worst aspect of the story was how rushed it was. The first half of the series was full of episodic filler episodes which did not develop the plot and mostly featured episodes about random women falling in love with the blank slate of a main and episodes centered on the uninspired romance between the two main characters. Because of this the episodes that were important to the plot were dealt with very quickly and almost glossed over in the grand scheme of things. \\n\\n\r\nDespite the supposed danger of the game, it seems like you would have to be a complete moron to get killed. Towns are safe, there are teleportation crystals, and boss fights were short and boring and easy. Besides, bosses don't respawn anyway. Then all of a sudden the arc came to an anticlimactic finish, illogically and out of nowhere. There was supposed to be 100 boss battles, but we're only shown a couple that are settled easily. But does SAO stop there? Nonono. It's not nearly bad enough yet.\\n\\n\r\nThe entire point of the series was an MMO where you couldn\u2019t escape and would die if you lost. While Kirito is, for all practical purposes, invincible anyway, an incident occurs that makes the MMO even less dangerous, effectively killing any kind of promise the original premise had. The second half features even more girls falling for our boring protagonist, a spindly 16 year old gamer inexplicably overpowering a grown man, netorare, kind of-incest, almost-tentacle rape, a world without logic, the degradation of women, and our wonderful protagonist defying all the rules of the game with THE ETERNAL POWER OF LOOOOOVE.\\n\r\n(dude, I don't think that's how the programming works)\\n\\n\r\nChock full with plot holes, contradictions, deus ex machina, and diaboli ex machina, and devoid of foreshadowing, originality, or subtlety, this is one of the, if not the, worst plots I have ever encountered in any medium. And I've read \"120 Days of Sodom.\"\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nGood scenery, but the character design was lacking. The characters were very generic looking and their armor and weapons weren't anything special. There were several atrocities as well. \\n\\n\r\nAll of the fairies looked stupid, in my humble opinion. Especially the scary butterfly man. There were a couple instances of obvious mistakes like characters that should be in the background of a fight that disappear then reappear after, but that's nitpicking compared to the real problems with this series.\\n\\n\r\nOne weird thing was that Kirito was apparently supposed to look different in the game than he was in real life, based on important un-spoilable plot elements, but he looks exactly the same.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nSame as the art. It's alright, but that means nothing if the series has no substance. Good sound is just icing on the cake and icing won't make this cake taste any less like shit. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nOh, boy. This is the worst part.\\n\r\nKirito: Kirito is a character who was designed as a blank slate so that losers could insert themselves into his place. He has no personality to speak of. He is the male Kristen Stewart of anime. His only unique trait or real aspect to his character is him being strong. Really. He's so strong people surrender to him without even fighting. He\u2019s pretty much perfect for  a shut-in loser who\u2019s addicted to video games. I mean, only a couple times in the series is he actually challenged because he is an all powerful 1337 b34t3r. Seriously, most of his enemies only hate him because they\u2019re jealous. \\n\\n\r\nWhat is the point of an action series where the protagonist cuts through all of his enemies with the greatest of ease? There was more than one occasion where he died, but did not die because plot armor. Kirito is too cool for the silly rules of (virtual) reality that apply to everyone besides him.\\n\\n\r\nAsuna: She's perfect as well. She's strong, beautiful, and most importantly, good at cooking. She falls in love with Kirito inexplicably and out of nowhere and they just have no chemistry. When you pair a Mary sue up with a blank slate/self-insertion you get a love story on the level of twilight.\\n\\n\r\nI feel like the writers were trying to make her a strong female character at first, but seeing as how well she fits the female gender role, how often she must be the damsel in distress, and all the shameless fanservice, I'd say the portrayal of her character was archetypal to the highest degree and somewhat misogynistic. Ok, very misogynistic. She\u2019s mostly here for Kirito to look cool. What kind of self-insert doesn\u2019t have a Mary sue girlfriend? \\n\\n\r\nSuguha: She's Kirito's sister-cousin thingy. She's clearly very stupid because she did not recognize Kirito even though he looks no different in the game than he does in real life. All I can say about her besides that is this: she was thrown in for extra fanservice, obligatory incest, (Why is this a thing in Japan? Is the birth rate issue that bad?) a half-assed and predictable love triangle, and for another girl to love Kirito because, hey, you can never have too many. She has no personality and she's annoying. She\u2019s pretty much here to emphasize Kirito\u2019s coolness.\\n\\n\r\nVillains: I don't remember these guys\u2019s names tbh. There was a MMO designer guy who was responsible for a bunch of people's deaths, but for some reason we're supposed to think is good in the end. There's also the butterfly guy. He was my favorite because he was so hilarious, but he was also my least favorite because he was the least threatening villain ever. There were also two purple tentacle guys. I don't really know who they are and I think they were just there to grope Asuna, but they were weird.\\n\\n\r\nAs a whole the villains either have unrealistic motives or no motives at all. With the original programmer guy they try to make a morally grey villain, but fail entirely. He is also there to make Kirito look cool, but for reasons that I cannot describe in a spoiler-free review. With butterfly man they make him too pathetic and unrealistically evil. He was made like this to contrast with Kirito and so, like everybody else in the series, he\u2019s just there to make Kirito look cool. And I don't know wtf to say about the purple tentacle guys. They were probably the best villains though. The desire to tentacle rape is certainly the most believable motive I encountered in this anime, especially seeing as most characters never even offered one. Although that is like saying that they are the undisputed champions of the Special Olympics, congrats to them anyways.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly there were a lot more antagonists, but these ones are the only ones that matter enough to me to write about. The others weren't memorable enough to criticize. They were all bad, let's just say that. \\n\\n\r\nEverybody else: Because nobody else matters. Hell, I just put in Suguha to be nice and it's not like the villains actually matter because Kirito is pretty much invincible. Shit, Asuna only matters because she pleases Kirito. If Asuna didn't make such boss sandwiches, she wouldn't even be relevant to the story.\\n\r\nThere are a couple recurring characters with no personality and no development, but they show up rarely and only to make Kirito look cool and/or fall in love with him. \\n\\n\r\nThere are several incidents where Kirito inexplicably befriends or makes acquaintance of characters devoid of personality who do nothing, but get killed. And then we're supposed to care about the death of these random characters. You can't just introduce random characters, kill them, and say \"ohhhh dey died isnt dat saaaad.\" You need development. \\n\\n\r\nEven worse is the thousands of unidentified characters that die early on in SAO. We're supposed to feel emotion about this, but any writer knows that reducing characters to mere numbers dehumanizes them thus removing all emotion from the equation. They probably skipped these scenes because they were incapable of making sympathetic and realistic character. This laziness and lack of ability foreshadowed the fate of the rest of the show's characters.\\n\\n\r\nDid they even try? Of course they didn't. They don't have to and people will love it anyway. ALL ABOARD THE HYPE TRAIN.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI'm going to be honest: The most enjoyment I got out of this anime was laughing at the \"serious\" scenes. When Kirito introduced Asuna, in real life, as \"lightning flash Asuna\" and talked about her guild and power level, I seriously cried from laughter. Actually every time Kirito cried so did I. Just not in the way I think I was supposed to. I spat out my iced tea when the butterfly guy was licking agirlwhowillnnotbenamedforthesakeofnospoilers's face. That was too much. Seriously, it stained my shirt. Did anybody actually enjoy that scene? Did anybody actually take that seriously? The answer: no. Or, at least, I really hope that\u2019s the answer. My God, I hope that\u2019s the answer. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the action aspect, I'm not sure how anybody would enjoy the action scenes, and I certainly did not. They were all too easy. There were a couple times when it tried to make it look like he was in trouble, but lo and behold, some miracle happened every time. Knowing how the fight will end is an unfortunate situation in plenty of anime, but those anime at least have more creative fight scenes and abilities or they are character oriented anyway. Even runescape has better and more interesting fights than this MMO. \\n\\n\r\nBesides the quality, there were quantity issues as well. This isn't really an action anime. The majority of the episodes were focused on Kirito saving Asuna from something, women falling in love with Kirito, or about Kirito and Asuna's boring relationship. I don't think there's a single episode that's \"action-packed.\" Seeing as we were supposed to get 100 boss fights, this is a problem and it would be a letdown, but after a hundred of those dreary fights I believe I would likely die of boredom. \\n\\n\r\nThe romance was just bad. There's much better romance out there and the characters had no chemistry. I'd prefer a romance with characters that are actually intriguing. Also, most anime focus on the build-up of the relationship a lot, but here it happens right away and there's no time to enjoy anything. This wouldn't be that bad if their relationship was interesting, but they don't have any serious arguments and are essentially the perfect couple. The only enjoyable developments in their relationship were the ones where Asuna was in danger. And by \"enjoyable developments\" I mean \"developments that made Kirito cry like a little girl.\" Those moments were still awful, but comparatively speaking, they were rather enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nThis is not an anime that I would recommend to anyone. I would not even recommend it to my worst enemy. That is cruelty of which I am not capable. It was atrocious, infuriating, corny, clich\u00e9, contrived, horrid, purple tentacled, pseudo-incestuous, borderline-misogynistic, vaguely misogynistic, completely misogynistic, plebeian, an affront to mankind, unintelligent, crafted by the devil, a war on art, used to torture terrorists, bourgeois, anti-intellectual, inbred, languid, shallow, self-insertionly, corny, the antithesis of Shakespeare, the apotheosis of awful fiction, blank, infantile, pathetic, vacuous, vapid, salacious, inane, imbecilic, an abortion, Stygian, sub-par, bland, poorly thought out, corny, loathsome, vomit-inducing, virulent, bile, poorly executed, infernal, eviscerating, flippant, an insult to its audience, cadaverific, philistine, lame, sad in all the wrong ways, funny in all the wrong ways, painful, paint-drying, boner-killing, wretched, impotent, generic, unemotional, repetitive, redundant, boring, and corny. I really really wish I hadn\u2019t watched it. If you\u2019re one of the people who told me it was a \u201cmust watch\u201d then fuck you. Not even funny. \\n",

            "content": "After examining forums, comments, and reviews on Sword Art Online, it doesn't take a genius to recognize that this anime adaptation is one of the most controversial, disputable TV Series of the year. Thus, it'll be understandable if you disagreed with me at some point in this review, but please take the time to actually read it before deciding \"oh, just another fan boy\" or \"gross, just another hater.\" Because, in my opinion, Sword Art Online doesn't deserve the amount of crap it gets or the amount of praises; essentially, it's mediocre.\r\nFirst and foremost, the Sword Art Online TV Series is an adaptation of thelight novels under the same name. People who have witnessed this pattern unfold before know the difficulties in the adaptation process. For those of you new to the community, when a studio announces an adaptation it usually means two things: fan service, and fillers. Sword Art Online is a perfect victim for the studios these days that desire the big bucks. What derived from a romantic, unique concept was transformed into an utter construction of unoriginality and clich\u00e9s. \\n\\n\r\nOther words, all the significant features residing in the original light novels were compacted down into seemingly unimportant bits and the wrong things got emphasized.\\n\\n\r\n= Story (3) =\\n\\n\r\nWhat the studios completely ignore first is the purity of the story, scripts, and chronological order of events. It doesn't even matter to the producers if positive/negative attention is given to Sword Art Online as long as the work gains popularity, discussions, and trends. Well, if you just watch anime collectively and only for enjoyment, it doesn't matter too much if the dialogues sound cheesy or unrealistic. However, there are too many clich\u00e9d story narratives, the dialogues require better writing, and [insert more heedless blobs of complaints you can read elsewhere].\\n\\n\r\nThe premise and first half of Sword Art Online actually poses an intriguing concept of survival of the fittest, which just isn't elaborated on enough to continuously track the audience's attention. In the actual light novel, there's much more emphasis on action-based themes than what's presented in the anime. Execution of the script definitely has problems, the pacing embodies inconsistencies which could've improved, and the story does contain some questionable timeline eclipses. However, it wouldn't exactly be the source material's fault if a parody of their work is bad. \\n\\n\r\n= Character (5) =\\n\\n\r\nThe main protagonist Kirito and his companion Asuna both illustrate essentially perfect beings. Kirito is a beater whose masculinity cannot be touched by anyone vincible. Comparatively, Asuna strives for a taint of sexiness with her slender yet untouchable body, and she can cook perfectly--somewhat misogynistic but inevitable. As a couple, Kirito and Asuna are both interesting subjects due to their fair share of intimate interactions with each other and other characters at first.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the chemistry between the two main romance interests, in the anime, quickly devolves into little or none at all. Events are laid out too bluntly, at a false pace, and Kirito's dedication for Asuna appears to be more artificial than in the light novels. Asuna became a target for fan service and though the appearance for fan service itself isn't exactly a terrible thing, the problem resides with how they applied that to more females. What shouldn't have processed through as a harem became apparent. Instead of illustrating the chemistry between Asuna and Kirito wholeheartedly, the Series often diverted with several unrelated (female) story arcs, which in turn didn't contribute to much of Kirito's phlegmatic personality anyways.\\n\\n\r\nThe main problem with the side characters is that barely any time is spent on them and most of them don't really have a purpose after their first appearance. Even when they do, you don't remember their names or why their presence is significant.\\n\\n\r\n= Animation (8)/Sound (9) =\\n\\n\r\nIt's almost factual that nobody can complain about the artistic aspects of Sword Art Online. The impacting action scenes did themselves justice with intense atmospheres. Character designs transported from the light novels comprised of more details and it is overall fitting. Noticeably, the background in some of the scenes portrays a vivid, limitless sky, which soothingly befits the floating island setting.\\n\\n\r\nThe Original Sound Tracks from the anime are just fine. Although it would've been better to switch around its soundtracks, the synchronization of music with the art worked out efficiently. Both the Ops & EDs consisted of scores beautifully done by the artist; Yuki Kajiura strikes the mood perfectly yet again. Each voice acting roles also surprisingly resembled their character's traits.\\n\\n\r\n= Enjoyment (7) =\\n\\n\r\nAdmittedly, Sword Art Online was a guilty pleasure the day it aired each week despite its flaws. The premise alone embraced me in a MMORPG setting which many have nostalgia for. Although a bit romanticized, the production actually portrayed the prehistoric Medieval Europe (in this case) and flourishing civilization of many cities like Venice at the time fairly well. And those familiar with the time period knows Sword Art Online just added another layer of wistfulness. \\n\\n\r\nHonestly, Sword Art Online provides decent entertainment if you watch it playfully without expecting serious, satirical works of some sort. Otherwise, it may be a disaster if you end up taking the concepts the show throws at you too literally. \\n\\n\r\n= Overall (5) =\\n\\n\r\nA well thought-out premise and concept which ended up being jammed into a catastrophic adaptation\u2014basic outline of Sword Art Online. It's really a shame that an action-packed Light Novel franchise became a victim of today's failing anime industry. This TV series comprises of lots of story arcs which should've been ignored, but was instead included due to their rewarding of pure fan service. \\n\\n\r\nThere are too many trickled-down, mixed lighthearted scenes for someone to take the anime too seriously. Yet, the producer of the anime almost expects you to nonsensically. In the end, it's up to the audience to take Sword Art Online seriously or not. For one's health, I suggest viewing this TV Series as a romantic comedy with quirky action scenes and supernatural settings. Otherwise, for the real action-packed themes promised by the premise, I guarantee that the Light Novels will present a much better experience than this \"once-in-a-lifetime\" plebeian anime adaptation.",

            "content": "Sword Art Online was one of the most hyped up animes of Summer 2012 and has probably the widest range of scores I\u2019ve ever seen. Does it live up to the hype? Read on to find out! That being said, skip to the consensus (TLDR) if you don't want to read blocks of text! :D Please do not send anything overly negative to me; polite and constructive criticism is always appreciated.\r\nPLOT:\r\nThe Good: Man, they really went for a lot here. The light novels themselves were actually more action/adventure focused, something that doesn\u2019t happen in the anime. I\u2019m going to do my best not to giveany spoilers, but essentially, the anime Sword Art Online aims to be a love story of epic proportions, where their relationship will experience highs and lows ranging from boundless joy to aching tragedy. Straight up, if you don\u2019t like the main characters, you probably won\u2019t like this anime. That\u2019s how most love stories work. However, if you\u2019re like me, and you absolutely adore the main characters, then this anime is definitely for you! Sword Art Online additionally does a brilliant job of easing us in to the massive, awe-inspiring frontier that is Aincrad. The concept of this anime -- being trapped in a strange, exotic new world and living in it -- is a dream that we all have had at one point, and it's fascinating to see it being unveiled before our eyes.\\n\\n\r\nThe Bad: At the same time, however, the execution has been done terribly. Lots of fans/first-time watchers \u2013 me included \u2013 felt that Kirito and Asuna were not given nearly enough character development. It\u2019s hard to root for someone that you barely know or hate. Another problem lies in the pace. The side stories were rushed, no doubt about, which is bad because they offered interesting insights into Kirito and Asuna\u2019s relationship and personality. At the same time, you can't really justify having two episodes of precious anime time being given to the side stories, and they honestly aren't as interesting as the main plot. Something else that irks me about Sword Art Online is how it suffers from deus ex machina. That is, it'll solve really big situations with just dumb stuff like \"it's the power of love\" or \"strength of will trumps everything\". However, other amazing shows (Harry Potter, Clannad) have done similar things, so it's whatever.\\n\\n\r\nCONSENSUS: 7/10. Sword Art Online attempted to create a love story of epic proportions\u2026something that they partially succeeded in. Although they eased us in beautifully in the start, undeveloped characters, a rushed storyline, and miracle syndrome make it lose quite a bit of its impact. \\n\\n\\n\r\nARTWORK: \\n\r\nThe artwork in this anime can be summed up into one word: inconsistent. The sceneries are drawn very well and have a wide variety (ranging from icy snowcaps to flowery meadows to beautiful cities\u2026), and the characters are done beautifully (a nice contrast to the stupid body proportions in Code Geass or the crazy facial expressions in Fate/Zero), but it gets stupidly bad during the battles. For some strange reason, instead of treating us to a smooth action sequence, we instead constantly gaze at character still shots. It\u2019s really frustrating when you know that the battle sequences could have been amazing!! Background animation is probably the most inconsistent part in that it gets really bad in towns but great in landscapes. I really don\u2019t know what to think. I think the animation of this anime is something that really sets it back from some of the great animes, and I\u2019m hoping it gets better in the future (especially the battle scenes, they can really make those a lot more enjoyable to wach).\\n\\n\r\nCONSENSUS: 7/10. Battle scenes are very badly animated, and backgrounds sometimes are drawn very sloppily. However, the sheer scope of sceneries in this anime is a delight to see.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC: \\n\r\nThe music is incredible. Yuki Kajiura is one of the biggest names in anime music, and her music is absolutely astounding. So far, the music\u2019s been perfect and set each mood beautifully. In particular, the battle scene music. Oh my god. I found myself humming it when I was eating breakfast, just a testament to how well done it is. As for the OP/ED, they\u2019re really generic. They\u2019re being done by LiSa, who\u2019s done so many OP/EDs by now, but they don\u2019t really stand out\u2026in a good or bad way. I don\u2019t know, I think Yuki Kajiura\u2019s music makes up for any disparities here though.\\n\\n\r\nCONSENSUS: 9/10, Music is great and going to be developed by Yuki Kajiura, the person who did Fate/Zero and Madoka Magica. OP/ED are generic, but that\u2019s not a bad thing. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: \\n\r\nThe characters are ridiculously hit or miss. Kirito is pretty much your perfect, flawless teenager. That\u2019s going to be a deal breaker for many of people upon knowing that. Many people like their protagonists to have flaws, to be more humanlike, more down to Earth, and having a character that\u2019s flawless frankly drops a lot of the realism. I would like to argue that the alternative of having a whiny protagonist that doesn\u2019t do anything is a lot worse though (Guilty Crown, I\u2019m looking at you). The same lies for the female protagonist, Asuna, our main character\u2019s love interest. Frankly, the relationship just came together too easily. Asuna also has the privilege of being practically perfect in every single way. No really: she can cook, she\u2019s incredibly beautiful, she\u2019s good at swordfighting, she\u2019s dedicated, and she\u2019s a tsundere (personally I love tsunderes). The side characters and the villains lack depth as well. Can anyone else picture how much more interesting this anime would have gotten if Sugou was initially some good guy that Asuna begins to fall for...only to be someone rotten in the inside? Instead, we're treated to a generic villain who literally doesn't have a single good quality.\\n\\n\r\nCONSENSUS: 6/10, Main character Kirito isn\u2019t absurdly annoying like A LOT of other main characters, but he does get what he wants a little too easily. Side characters are overly generic and get far too little time. Same with Kirito and Asuna, we needed more time for their development! \\n\\n\\n\r\nTHE BREAKDOWN: It's a great anime if you like Kirito and Asuna, but if you don't, you might as well watch another anime. The anime itself suffers from various flaws -- plot holes, shoddy animation, undeveloped characters -- that prevent me from giving it a high score. Still worth a watch though, if only so that you can rant about how good or bad it is on the forums after each episode. 7/10!\\n\\n\r\n(+) The light novel for this anime is incredibly well done (#1 rated light novel on MAL).\\n\r\n(+) Incredible nostalgia for any MMORPG gamers.\\n\r\n(+) Music is stellar, designed by the best.\\n\r\n(+) Anime gets a lot better after episode 8.\\n\r\n(+) The landscapes are absolutely beautiful...one of the benefits of making the anime set in a fantasy video game.\\n\r\n(+) Tons of people to discuss this anime with since it's popular; since it's polarizing, you get some very interesting arguments too.\\n\\n\r\n(\u2212) Characters not developed thoroughly enough.\\n\r\n(\u2212) Anime may be rushed in first few episodes.\\n\r\n(\u2212) Suffers from very poor animation in some the fight scenes and in the background (budgeting). \\n\r\n(\u2212) Insertion of side stories before main plot may cause some viewers to lose interest.\\n\r\n(\u2212) Anime suffers from miracle syndrome (occasionally will solve problems with a miracle).\\n\r\n(\u2212) Causes you to waste time talking with people about the latest episode of SAO, whether you hate it or love it.",

            "content": "A brave young hero. His beautiful sidekick who becomes a love interest. Dual wielding swords. A world in chaos. Lives at stake. All seem so cliche, why would I even think to watch this? I made the right decision to. I know there is alot of controversy over this anime currently so I, naturally, must enter my two cents to defend and be realistic about this hot commodity anime of 2012:\r\n*As spoiler free as can possibly be*\r\nStory:\r\nThe story is indeed EXTREMELY rushed. While the ideals and thoughts behind the initial plot are absolutely outstanding and completely unique and original, the SAO anime timeline leaves littleroom for the storyline to blossom. As a 21 year old, I found it fairly childish at times yet still enjoyable. I feel as though younger people wouldn't appreciate the underlying plots which the plot holes failed to fill and give way completely to imagination. As a biased idealist, I give the story an 8/10 because the idea is there, the timeframe wasn't. But I guess that's to be expected in today's anime industry.\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art is visually stunning and appealing. The colors draw the viewer in and the scenery is the hook. The entire landscape of Aincrad is a feast for the eyes. On the flipside, some of the fights scenes were choppily done in comparison to the beauty of the backdrops. The boss details, especially the Skull Reaper, were phenomenal and several shots were created in a very different, unexpected perspective, adding additional interest to the episode's events. So that's an A++++ to colors and imaginary vision and a B to combat scenes to make a 9/10.\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nYuki Kajiura. Need I say more? 10/10. Absolutely outstanding and completely relevant and appropriate for the anime. The music truly makes the anime and hooks the viewer emotionally.\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nKirito is your typical boy hero destined to save his love interest and destroy a corrupt system. Sure, seems pretty unoriginal. However, I connected to Kirito more than I feel many do. The episodes that seemed like fillers served as ways for us to get to know Kirito and his imperfections and taught us to let them go. While the anime completely fails in terms of side characters with failed attempts of Klein and Egil, the main characters are given enough spotlight to give the viewer a general consensus on their personality, actions, and values toward the Cardinal system of SAO. Asuna is a fantastic heroine at the beginning, immediately winning all the hearts of all male viewers and becoming a role model for young women. But as the anime progresses, the anime took a completely different direction in her character than I expected. While Asuna possessed so much strength and leadership, the anime fails to show this as it continues on, letting her slip into the whole damsel in distress role, especially in ALO. I truly felt the connection between her and Kirito and their desire to protect each other but their characters, as well as their love story, need more depth. 8/10.\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI can't lie. I truly enjoy this anime. I have such a vision of it in my head that I feel the storymakers truly intended to get across to all viewers. Whilst the anime is lacking in depth, can be corny/childish/predictable, and is unreally rushed, it provides an entertaining feast for the eyes and ears and even for the heart from episodes 8 and on. I can't deny this one a 10/10 because I truly enjoy it.\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI have to give this anime a 10/10 wholly due to the fact that I can truly envision its perfection if it could be given more time. The character ideas are there, the unique and individualistic views are there, the fantastic composer and visual settings are there. It has the correct recipe, but the incorrect \"bake time\". Putting aside my bias, it should probably deserve a generous 9/10 due to plot holes, rushed timeframe, and incomplete character development.\\n\\n\r\nHere's to hoping episode 25 will be a successful completion of an anime that could truly use a cherry on top of the sundae. The fandom will be on the edge of their seats and...so will I. I can't help it, this anime is my guilty pleasure.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Why is SAO bad? First of all let us ask what SAO is and what bad is. SAO is an anime adaptation of a light novel of the same name. The light novel was created in 2002 by Reki Kawahara, around the time when MMORPG were the craze. The anime like the name suggest is about a virtual world in a MMO. Akin to .hack//SIGN it\u00a1\u00afs about a group of people being stuck inside a videogame (at least until the third volume where the game changes) where the only way to escape is to finish the game. The MC is a guy named Kirito whomeets various people along his adventure to the top of the tower where the key to completing the game lies. However, unlike .hack//SIGN, in SAO everything that could have done really well is destroyed. Now, let us get back to what the word bad means. It means it\u00a1\u00afs not 'good in any manner or degree' according to dictionary.com and there many reasons for SAO to be bad. These reasons include overuse of cliches and overused tropes, bad characterization and that it exists as a self insert and wish fulfillment.\\n\\n\r\nA major concern I have with SAO is the uses of cliches and overused tropes. One instance is the use of the well known clause in anime where Kirito said 'Do I have to use that?' in episode 9 when fighting a boss. This is one of the biggest cliche in anime and so bad that other shows mock shows using said cliche. In the scene where Kirito said that, there were players dying from the boss. This meant that Kirito let people die because he didn't other players to find out about his skill.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the things that I found extremely irritating about SAO was the fact that Kirito was the strongest in the SAO the game barring the admin. This is evident due to the fact that he is a BEATer (a portmanteau between the words BETA and cheater). Also, he has a unique skill where only two people in the game have. Not only was Kirito overpowered, his girlfriend Asuna is overpowered as well. This might be sexist but I find it hard to believe that a girl would be good at MMO (she is one of the highest leveled person in the game) when she has never played them before even if SAO is different from normal MMOs.\\n\\n\r\nThis brings in new questions. Why did the author make the main characters the strongest? This is due to self insertion and wish fulfillment. This is painfully obvious when plenty of pretty girls such as Sachi, Lizbeth, Silica and Asuna are lusting after his manhood and his personality is very similar to teenagers who have emo tendencies and antisocial behavior so they can relate to him. He is also later shown to be a massive nerd therefore pandering to computer geeks. Asuna is particularly the largest wish fulfillment girl I have ever seen. She possess incredible power like Kirito, is considered beautiful by pretty much everyone, excels in cooking both in game and in real life and comes from a wealthy family which are considered traits of a perfect girl. However, I personally hate her due to these facts.\\n\\n\r\nThe characterization is absolutely atrocious. First there are the main characters Kirito and Azuna as I mentioned before are terrible characters with terrible characterization. They have inconsistent personality such when Kirito suddenly changes from an emo kid to a happy going person between episodes and when Asuna suddenly becomes a tsundere. Also, characters such as Sachi and Lizbeth fall in love with Kirito even though they only knew him for few days. Even Asuna is guilty of this since she had sex with Kirito despite not knowing too much about him. The only good characters in the series are minor characters such as Silica and Klein. (Why couldn't they become the main characters? Klein as the MC would have made the show better.)\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing is also a major issue. There are just too many time skips in the anime. This makes the episodes too episodic and not have real plot. I am not saying that being episodic is bad but the episodes between 2-8 serve in no point in the plot other than being a side story. The anime would have been a lot better if it was pure comedic, slice of life MMO life about a guild instead of what it is now where it changed from sol to having an actual plot which neither of them were good.\\n\\n\r\nThe only really good aspect of the anime is the music, decent character design, animation and the setting was done well. It had Yuki Kajiura as the series composer who is one of my favourite composers and LiSA, another one of my favourite, as the singer for the opening. The setting for the anime is surprisingly good and is somewhat creative. The art wasn\u00a1\u00aft anything special but was still one of the best aspect about the anime. Regardless, all of these were sadly all wasted on this bad anime.\\n\\n\r\nDespite all I said, the worst part about SAO is the potential it had to be a good anime. It could have easily become my favourite anime if it was done right. It had the trapped in the video game trope which I quite like. In the end it doesn't even matter what I write since the anime will sell like hotcake. The fact that an anime with bad characterization, plot, and plenty of cliches is the most popular is telling that anime is dead. In MAL SAO is rated higher than Nodame, Tatami Galaxy and many other anime that are better than SAO. This is disappointing and I hope publishers do not start making similar anime to SAO just because it\u00a1\u00afs popular just to make money.\\n\\n\r\n*Minor update*  \\n\r\nI would like to thank the user Veronin for helping me when I was writing this.\\n",

            "content": "Scavenge. Slay. Survive.\r\nThis is what Sword Art Online should have been about. It should have been an anime that was a pure MMORPG in anime form, as it was made out to be. What did we get instead? 55% slice of life, 25% romance, 10% action, 10% plot. SAO is quite possibly the most overrated and overhyped anime I've ever come across in my anime years. SAO is highly regarded by its fans as one of the best Light Novels ever, better than Fate/Zero, Monogatari series, Haruhi series, Kara no Kyoukai, Welcome to the NHK and Baccano for a few examples. Granted, I haven't readany of these works, but for some peculiar reason, I have an extremely hard time believing this. Why? Well, this will probably get me some flame for being biased, but because the anime is bad. Really bad. Now, some might say that it's because the adaptation of the anime is bad compared to the Novel, but I pretty much say bull. Even if that is the case, it still doesn't change the fact story is extremly generic and so far has nothing I couldn't get from watching .Hack//SIGN. If I don't like the plot and characters in the anime, I most certainately won't like them in the novel.\\n\\n\r\nBut enough with that... What exactly is it that makes me dislike this series so much that I would call it the most overrated and overhyped anime I've yet to come across? Let's begin.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: \"The animation is fantastic and incredibly smooth every single scene! It looks absolutely beautiful!\"\\n\\n\r\nFalse. While I can agree that the animation is very good looking, it's not as beautiful and gorgeous as most people make it out to be. The setting is just another generic fantasy-like setting you've already seen before in oh so many anime before SAO. The artstyle is also very unfitting. What do I mean? Let me explain very short and simple - The anime is supposed to be serious and dark (keyword being supposed) yet the artstyle makes this world look like a fairy tale due to the bright colors and round character designs. And animation wise, as in movement, looks exactly like every other anime out there. The movements are just as stiff and movement-less as the anime next to it. The only times the animation is better than your average anime is when there's a fight going on, though the choreography in these fights are pretty boring. It's mostly just rushing towards the enemy and slashing away. They could've made the fights so much more enjoyable and interesting if they put more focus on making the fights more tactical and strategy heavy. \\n\\n\r\nThe only thing I could give props for, creativly wise, is how sometimes we see from the player's POV. While this was nice the first time, this starts to get very repetitive as you get to see it in every episode and the fisheye style starts to annoy you more and more. Fortunately, this disappears about halfway and we never have to see it again. But wait... That was the only creative thing they did, and now it's gone. I don't know if I should complain or be happy. \\n\\n\r\nEven the less popular Ao no Exorcist which was also animated by A-1 Pictures was better animated than SAO in my opinion, even during the daily life events, and that one wasn't either extremly well animated. But that anime had much more interesting fights and looked a bit more flashy. Though that's to be expected seeing as that was a Shounen and this is a Seinen. Oh who am I kidding, SAO's obviously a Shounen.\\n\\n\r\nSound: \"The OST was composed by Kajiura Yuki! Instant awesomeness!\"\\n\\n\r\nWrong. While I do love Kajiura Yuki, whom has done some amazing works in some earlier titles (most notably Kara no Kyoukai), this is definitely one of her weakest works yet. The soundtrack is so far lifeless and generic and has nothing special going on with it. For being an anime about an MMORPG, I sure as hell am not getting an MMO feeling while watching this anime. The soundtrack is so generic that I could take the entire OST and put it over any other fantasy anime, and no matter how great the anime is, I would still get the same generic feeling as I get while watching SAO. It does have some nice tracks and the OST can grow on you, but as I just said, this is definitely one of her weakest works and doesn't even come close to her works in anime such as Kara no Kyoukai, Madoka Magica and the previously mentioned .Hack//SIGN.\\n\\n\r\nVoice cast wise, it's very mediocre. The voice cast is very bad at getting me entranced in the dialogues since it sounds like they are always reading straight from a script. Only some characters have proved the different, however, those characters were mostly just side characters that disappear as soon as they are introduced. It also doesn't help that all female characters speak in a typical cute way, further detracting the fact that this anime is supposed to be serious. \\n\\n\r\nSound effect wise, it's good. It has everything you would expect from an anime that has a video game theme. Swords colliding, objects disappearing, slain enemies and menu sounds.\\n\\n\r\nStory: \"The story just keeps getting better and better!\"\\n\\n\r\nNope. Well, to give it credit, it did have a solid first episode and a nice premise. People are playing a Virtual video game which they cannot escape untill they defeat the final boss. And if they are killed in the game, they won't respawn, instead they die in real life aswell! That's pretty interesting. Just a damn shame that it all went down the toilet the further down the anime went with the story. For some reason, A-1 Pictures decided to animate the side stories in episodes 3-8 which severely slowed down the pace to the point where the anime got even more boring that fillers in Shounen anime! That's not very good storytelling if you ask me! I see no reason why they couldn't have just released these episodes on the BD/DVD volumes, as this would make the anime extremely more tolerable and have a much better pace. But, does it get better when the main plot starts again? Yes, but only for a short while (short while=one episode.) After this short while, the story gets boring and makes you care less about anything. This is supposed to be a battle for survival, so why the hell is the story not showing us this gruesome world where people die in real life if they are killed in the game? Instead, it focuses on the bad romance between Kirito and his ever growing harem, which we'll get to in the character section.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the romance, if you ask me, this is what the anime is about. Not the plot, you know the whole being stuck inside a game premise, but instead the romance of our main characters. And while I do say that this is about being stuck inside an MMORPG and the objective is about escaping, this only counts for the first 14 episodes. After those episodes, SAO goes over to a very boring and very clich\u00e9 damsel in distress story.\\n\\n\r\nAnd how can I forget that SAO resorts to miracles for both of its two arcs' endings. Asspull miracles at that, since these things are never properly explained, or not explained at all.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: \"The characters are so believable! They are so full of life and relatable!\"\\n\\n\r\nI'm sorry, but I'm afraid that is incorrect. For starters, Kirito, out main protagonist is supposed to made out as a shut-in gamer Otaku. Someone who is antisocial, in so many words. So since he is just that, it's obvious that he would play as a Solo Player since he prefers to be left alone. Right? Then tell me, why the hell is he going around helping and saving more people than I can count if he's supposed to be a Solo Player? Kirito was written as a Solo Player for the first 8 episodes, and yet he helps people out during ALL of these episodes! This is a 100% contridiction to how he was claimed to be and act. But hey, we need some romance in this survival story, right? So let's throw in multiple girls whom are all after Kirito's virtual penis. The only reason why Kirito is helping out mainly females is because he's just looking for someone to bone. He finally gets one girl who is willing to give up her virtual virginity to Kirito, Asuna. Well then, Kirito finally has a girl he can have some sweet romance with. Nope. The romance between Kirito and Asuna is one of the worst written romances I've come across in an action anime. They spend so little time actually together were they would show off romantic feelings to each other that it's impossible to believe that they actually love each other. They are the typical Tsundere-Shy guy combo that you always see nowadays. And don't get me started about what happens after the first half. Oh boy, that's when things go from bad to worse.\\n\\n\r\nThe character development is barely there, mainly because these characters change personality more often than Aizen trolls somebody in Bleach. But what about the side character? Well... They're barely even there! SAO introduces a lot of characters during the first half of the series, but 75% (random percentage) of all those either never appear again (until maybe a brief cameo in the last episode) or appear way too little. They focus so much on the main characters that you start to forget that the series even introduced more characters. Not good, yo. When you create characters you need to split up the development and screen time of side characters and main characters at a good ratio. Sure, the focus should be on the main characters, but it's also important to not forget about the side characters, as they can be a good way to develop the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nValue: \"Best Light Novel ever!\"\\n\\n\r\nIf this is what people would claim to be the best Light Novel of all frakking time, then I don't know what the hell people in their right mind are thinking. Because based on the anime, AND from what I've heard happens next, I see no reason why you would call it that since the novel seems to just keep going in circles and brings nothing new. If that is what people call A-Class writing, then I guess Kubo Tite is one of the best writers of all time.\\n\\n\r\nAnd all the hate the series gets, this is your fault to blame. You, as in the ones who hyped this anime to be the most amazing thing ever produced. When you hype something as much as this one, you're risking damaging its overall appeal due to leading people into thinking that it's gonna be a masterpiece, only to be left extremely disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: \"Best Anime ever!\"\\n\\n\r\nThis could have been one of the top anime of 2012, but ended up as one of the worst of the bunch because of bad directing and awful storytelling. If the series had focused more on the actual premise, this couldn've been a bit more interesting - however - the bad decision to put the side stories among the main episodes, the poorly written romance and the incredibly clich\u00e9 plot (especially in its second half) makes SAO one hell of a drag to watch. It had its few moments, such as an interesting first episode, and a pretty okay episode 10. But the majority of the anime is nothing more than wish fullfillment and fan catering, appealing only to MMORPG players, teenagers and otaku.\\n\\n\r\nBest anime ever my ass.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now for my own enjoyment; where's that anime adaptation of Chapter 16.5?\\n\\n\r\nhttp://i48.tinypic.com/2v8041y.jpg",

            "content": "I've heard many things about SAO (Sword Art Online): There's either a lot of love or a lot of hate for it. Personally, I'm leaning a little towards the latter, but not fully on it. Before you start sending me hate mail or press the \"Not Helpful\" button, please hear me out.\r\nAs a gamer, and a fan of MMORPG's, I tried to keep my expectations not too high, because you know what they say: \"The bigger they are, the harder they fall\". Unfortunately, SAO fits this saying to a T, as it was one of the most disappointing anime that I've seen this year. Why?Well, why do think I'm writing this forsaken review?!\\n\r\n~~~~~~\\n\r\nStory: (3/10)\\n\r\nThe story of SAO involves players getting trapped within an VRMMORPG (Virtual Reality Massive Multiplayer Online Roleplaying Game), in which they are required to beat all 100 floors of the game in order to leave. The catch is, however, that if a character's HP drops to zero before clearing the game, not only do they die in the game, they also die in real life. \\n\\n\r\nThe concept of this story is absolutely brilliant. Unfortunately, the execution of this story is poor. The writing and pacing is just awful. Even during the SAO arc of the show, while this was tolerable, I was left wondering, \"What on earth is happening here?\" The Alfheim arc, on the other hand, was just... I don't even want to describe it. Parts of Episodes 21 and 24 were just borderline unwatchable... (I'm not going to say which parts, just to avoid spoilers...) At least the ending was somewhat satisfying...\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the story was just utter CRAP. A good premise at first, but was terribly executed due to poor writing.\\n\r\n~~~~~~\\n\r\nCharacters: (2/10)\\n\r\nIn my opinion, the characters of Sword Art Online were by far the weakest part of the show. The main male character, Kirito, is just a Gary Stu, and nothing more. But somehow, he has the ability to attract girls by just looking at them. Why are these girls attracted to him? I'll never know. The main female character, Asuna, was introduced in Episode 2 as a badass who I had high hopes for. And what happens with her? The writers decide to turn her into a generic tsundere, and in the Alfheim arc of the show, she basically turns into f**king Princess Peach. Suguha, other than being there for the sake of fanservice, and to be part of a love triangle that involved a little bit of incest (It didn't work for me in Elfin Lied, it doesn't work for me here...), pretty much served next to no purpose (In my eyes). And to go into deeper detail about Kirito and Asuna, I could not for the LIFE OF ME understand the romance with Kirito and Asuna. It felt so forced and plot-driven that it made me feel absolutely frustrated. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, I'd be lying if I didn't say that the reunion of Kirito (or Kazuto) and Asuna during the final episode was heartwarming... (but I digress).\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting characters were either uninteresting or just really annoying. The only character I had actual interest in was Klein, but even then, he was pretty much tossed aside. And as for Sugou, he is one of the worst villains I have ever seen. Period. He just absolutely disgusts me... (Though he has a certain line that's absolutely HILARIOUS!)\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, next to none of the characters were interesting or likeable in the slightest...\\n\r\n~~~~~~\\n\r\nArt/Animation: (10/10)\\n\r\nWith my bitching and moaning aside, what DO I like in SAO? That's easy. I love how it looks. The art in this show is absolutely beautiful. From the scenery to the action scenes, the animation is consistent and fluid, and the scenery is just gorgeous. Maybe it's the fact that graphics/art is one of the major things I look into within a video game, but I digress.\\n\\n\r\nWith animation, this anime hits a perfect bullseye.\\n\r\n~~~~~~\\n\r\nMusic: (8/10)\\n\r\nSince I'm not a person to critique VA, I'll just talk about the music. Just like the art, I also really enjoyed the music of Sword Art Online (and because I'm a fan of Yuki Kajiura). It reminded me of the countless hours I used to spend on MapleStory leveling up my character. The first opening, \"Crossing Fields\", got me pumped for an episode; giving me SOME hope that the show would somehow redeem itself (Sadly, it didn't).\\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, the music was as good as the art!\\n\r\n~~~~~~\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (4/10)\\n\r\nWhile I did enjoy Sword Art Online in the beginning, progressing through it turned into more of a chore than an enjoyment. Most of the SAO arc was \"meh\", and the Alfheim arc was just painful to watch. If it wasn't for the action scenes, this would've been rated MUCH lower.\\n\r\n~~~~~~\\n\r\nOverall Score: 5.4 out of 10 (Rounded down to 5)\\n\r\nIn my honest opinion, Sword Art online was just painfully average. While the art and music are amazing, the story and characters prevent the show from being anything memorable (At least for me). Like I said before, it is definitely one of the most disappointing anime I have seen this year. Although it's not a 1 in my eyes, it's also not a 10.\\n\\n\r\nWas it worth the hype? No.\\n\r\nWill I watch it again? Probably not.\\n\\n\r\n*Feedback and Constructive criticism is welcome! Just don't be too nasty about it.*",

            "content": "|This review contains minor spoilers of the shitty story and characters|\r\nOh Sword Art Online, how you fooled millions of people into thinking that this show will be every gamer and anime fans' dream-come-true. We all came in, watched the first episode and thought \" This actually looks pretty cool \" , and continued watching like fish on a fishing rod. How wrong were we? Well, I will tell you, fellow readers, how the anime that received one of the largest fan-bases in recent times, holds the pinnacle of the word 'Overrated '; and I will do my best to convince you to NOT watch thisanime.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 2\\n\\n\r\nNow let's begin this review with discussing about the 'gripping' story, that led such a large fan-base into picking up SAO. So, I am not going to talk about the synopsis, as MAl has it displayed at all times, but I have to say that 'disappointment' is an understatement when describing the story of this anime. The biggest disappointment when watching this anime was the colossal time-skips that the anime takes. At one moment Kirito (the main character of the series) is a weakling, and literally in the blink of an eye, he is the most over-powered in the game. Thus, character-development is thrown out of the window. You just can't bring out a realistic and gripping story with such decisions. \\n\r\nThe other fact that made the story ridiculous, was the fact that Kirito simply levels so fast by PLAYING ALONE in a bloody MMORPG. If you have played at least 1 game of this genre, you would be highly aware that this is further than impossible, as you would need at least 100 players to beat a boss, of which all players must be very highly leveled. Thus the story becomes so poor and unrealistic, that it is almost hilarious.\\n\r\nThe first arc of SAO, which consists of the first 15 episodes, in terms of story overall, was terrible. There were time-skips and an unrealistic story. However, were the story becomes even more ridiculous is the second arc, which consists of the rest of the story. A damsel-in-distress is again, an understatement. You all should be fully aware of the video-game franchise 'Mario'. Kirito is Mario and Asuna (which I will talk about how awful of a character she is in my character section of this review), is princess Peach. And i am not exaggerating at all. This becomes so annoying, that watching this series, I remember wanting to bash my head against the wall to ease my fury. Oh wait, there's more! Ever wanted to see a character in a non-ecchi anime being 'done' by tentacles? Well this is the anime for you! Cause I am sure that all the kids that watched this series, thinking that it would be like a Disney film ended up getting rather scarred.\\n\r\nThe last factor that determines my score of '2' is the slice-of-life elements of the show, that tricked the whole audience of the show into thinking that this anime would be consisted of badass action sequences and a complex story. No. Instead, what we get is two idiots telling how much they love each other (even though they met in a game) for most of the series with little to no action. Enjoy.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 1\\n\\n\r\nOh you thought that I was telling the worst about this anime, were you? Well don't worry, it gets much worse in this section. To put it simply, the characters in this series are laughable, generic, idiotic and extremely one-dimensional. I will talk about some of the characters of the series.\\n\\n\r\n1. Kirito: So what do you get when you mix Makoto from school Days and every other generic protagonist from a harem series, combined with a bit retardation. You get Kirito of course! This guy is living a harem with 5 girls in this series, for absolutely no reason at all. The girls are treated like mindless retards that the only thing that pleases them is a douche like Kirito because of black hair and clothes. This guy is worse than a regular, clueless male lead from a harem series as he does not only understand the situation he finds himself in, but also does not give a shit. He dumps all he rest of the women (including side-chicks) and guess who he decides to go with in the end; HIS FUCKING SISTER. Yes, this anime is incestuous beyond belief. Kirito is the epitome of everything I hate in an anime character combined.\\n\\n\r\n2. Asuna: This chick is the one which receives the worst development (of almost all) of anime i have seen . She starts off looking like a cool female lead, with a large potential of evolution, and then, all of the sudden, she enters a part of Kirito's harem with what seems like so reason at all. She did not give a damn about Kirito, and then instantly wants his D, after sleeping on a field with him, for whatever reason that is.\\n\\n\r\nThe relationship of Asuna and Kirito is not only extraordinarily unrealistic, but also dreadful, as this relationship is seen to be so forceful. |SPOILERS| They end up adopting this one girl they find in the woods, and this is when the characters become so BAD. This father-daughter and mother-daughter relationship is so off from real life it's funny. The end up wasting most of the first arc with deciding whether to keep this girl or not (of which destroys the genres of this series wholly) and makes you think this show is a pathetic Clannad rip-off.\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters in this series are so forgettable I have forgotten most of their names as a result. The girls are shown to be whores with no wit, while the antagonists of the show are BEYOND HILARIOUS. The main antagonist of the series has NO purpose to trap this people in this world and kill them off. NO reason at all. This guy simply wants to look evil for no ulterior purpose, because this show needs a reason to exist.\\n\r\nIn the end, the characters receive little to no development, while proving to the audience that ' the power of friendship' exists in a couple such as Kirito and Asuna, as the romance is so bad in this series, that it feels like Asuna gets friend-zoned by Kirito for wants to jump his sister, which she was the worst character of all. For absolutely no reason at all, this girl wants to bang her brother (which the anime makes statements here and there stating that they are cousins living in the same house, which is still nonsensical). And Kirito falls for her because his motto is \" THE BIGGER THE TITS THE BETTER \".\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Art : 8\\n\\n\r\nI have to give credit to A-1 pictures for producing an anime that has decent-looking colors, and a fair amount of frames within the little battle-sequences this anime holds. The art however is nothing that spectacular as to up the score any more than it already is, as an anime which received such a massive audience deserved a greater production value, in my opinion. The background are usually fairly done, and there is no real lack of consistency when dealing with the anime as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nYuki Kajiura is an amazing composer and I feel that her music really fit the atmosphere of the show. It's a shame that she wasted her efforts in such a show like this, but whatever. The openings are both fantastic, with greater emphasis to the first one, \" Crossing Field \" which really suited the tone of the anime itself, combined with an excellent chorus.\\n\r\nAs a lot of anime, the voice-acting of SAO was on-par and did their job very well (with reference to the original Japanese dub), so whatever part i had to take seriously, I did due to the well executed emotions portrayed through words. Again, its a shame that they bothered to do such a good job on an anime like this.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3\\n\\n\r\nI tried to enjoy this show, I really did. But I could not take it seriously due to the harem, ecchi and incestuous nature of the show itself. The characters clearly lacked any substance and the story was laughable, thus further lowering my enjoyment of the show. The only facts that upped my enjoyment, was the fantastic opening, that made me want to watch each episode for that purpose. The animation made me enjoy the anime a bit more as well, but all these do not compensate with the sheer horror of the show's execution.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3\\n\\n\r\nOf course, the animation/art and sound only play for a small part of the overall score. The story and characters were anything below pathetic, and thus could not credit the show itself. Please, do yourself a favor and skip this entry, it is not worth your time at all. Don't get fooled by the popularity of the show itself, as that is not an indication of how good the show is, instead proves how many souls were lost in wasting their time on an anime like this.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review!

            "content": "Remember back in July I said that seeing the hype, this would probably become the next Guilty Crown? Well, reflecting on that now\u2026I would like to sincerely apologize\u2026to the Guilty Crown fans because Sword Art Online is nowhere near Guilty Crown\u2019s level in terms of visuals and soundtrack. \r\nAs we all know, studio A-1 is not known for action based anime. Most of their signature works are slice of life romantic comedies. The character designs are reminiscent of those in Working!! despite the fact that this show markets itself as a serious action fantasy series. Action scenes heavily utilized flash frames in order to cutcorners. Most of the time, the viewers are just shown the expressions of the characters instead of what is actually happening to the scene as a whole. In some instances, frames from previous episodes were even reused. Saying that the visuals were underwhelming is an understatement. \\n\\n\r\nThe music department is one of the few redeeming qualities of this show although this is perhaps Kajiura\u2019s most lackluster work in recent years. Some parts of soundtracks seem recycled right out of her recent works. Not to mention that sometimes, the music does not fit that particular scene. To put it simply, the music was nice, but lacks soul.\\n\\n\r\nUp until now, we\u2019ve covered the visuals and the music. Both aspects are mediocre at worst and are not bad enough to garner the negativity towards this show. So what went wrong? Well, obviously the leftover parts: the plot and the characters. \\n\\n\r\nTruth be told, the premise of the story had potential. However, that raw potential was untouched and on top of that, was marred by absolutely horrid execution in terms of storytelling and progression. An easy phrase to apply here is \u201cshow, not tell\u201d. Several backstory filler episodes were carelessly dumped into the beginning of the series giving the impression that the writers didn\u2019t care enough to put in the effort in order to integrate those side stories nicely into the series. To add insult to injury, those episodes were rushed. It\u2019s pretty ridiculous how the progression would have seemed smoother and more acceptable if the content was cut. And as the viewer continue watching, the story becomes a mass of plotholes rampant with tasteless fanservice that are randomly thrown in; In particular, the breaking of game mechanics written in cold, hard code at the convenience of the main characters which will be covered in the next section. Again, this is just very contradictory considering the fact that this show is trying to get viewers to take it seriously. You really have to wonder if the writers have forgotten that this is supposed to be a story about an MMORPG.\\n\\n\r\nNow we come to the last nail in the coffin: characters. Overpowered main characters are not uncommon and there are generally no problems if they are done well. Sword Art Online, unfortunately, did not handle this trope with expertise and fell into the trap where the main character bends plot more than gravity stretches time. Kirito is a walking deus ex machina. He can do and experience things that are impossible according to previously shown game mechanics. His personality and traits also changes according to the situation such as being a fumbling idiot one moment yet two minutes later he is soloing mobs while spitting out cheesy phrases from some Clint Eastwood movie. He simply does not leave a lasting impression other than his role and abilities in the story. Take away his dual wielding abilities and what do you remember him for? Nothing. On top of that, the story gives no sense of excitement due to his overpowering presence. The viewer does not feel pressured to known what\u2019s going to happen next since it\u2019s a given that Kirito will resolve the situation with no problems. Asuna, on the other hand, was introduced as a strong capable female but turned into a damsel in distress under the influence of Kirito\u2019s plot wielding; eventually becoming a fap fodder waifu character. What\u2019s also not helping the cast is that there are no significant characters other than the main characters. Side characters are pretty much irrelevant given their almost nonexistent character development. It\u2019s almost as if they are taking on an episodic approach to the characters despite the fact that this story is supposedly linear with a clear objective or ending in mind.\\n\\n\r\nThe final verdict? A three out of ten. This is taken into account the fact that I've changed into a masochist and this show has given me enjoyment and gratification with it's absolutely tortuous delivery. You really have to wonder if fans of this show love the premise of the series or the series itself. Perhaps this show would have done better if it chose a simply fantasy setting instead since it obviously wasn\u2019t adeptly incorporating elements of an MMORPG. In the end, Sword Art Online is a show that can present the who, what, when, and where with efficiency but fails completely to explain how and why I should bother giving a tiny rat\u2019s ass. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Story-\r\nSword Art Online (SAO) had real promising from reading the synopsis; however, I feel that it failed to delivery on all the hype it was getting. But after watching several episodes I feel like SAO has two major issues which make the anime really hard and jarring to get into. These two problems are the Story and the Characters.  The story starts off with the premise that players are trapped within the game, SAO, and the only way to get out is to clear all 100 levels. But the problem here, with the story, is that the anime tends to skip months at atime, which is very jarring as a view. It felt as if I missed out of entire events from watching one episode to another. \\n\\n\r\nThe story, though 11 episodes, hasn't really gone anywhere aside from the main characters fighting bosses and proceeding through the levels, but the main problem is that there is no \"main\" villain per say. And what I mean is that we don't really see a villain (can be argued that the game is the main villain, but I don't think that this was intended).  This bothers me personally, I like to see who is pulling the strings or at least some hint of someone behind everything. Sure we saw the creator in episode one, but after that he is never mention again, as of yet. So I've given the story a lower score because it just seems to not be going anywhere and because of skipping so much time.\\n\\n\r\n3/10\\n\\n\r\nArt-\\n\\n\r\nCharacters look great, sets look great, different levels have different art styles, and they all look great. Not much more to say here.\\n\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nSound-\\n\\n\r\nI really loved the music in SAO, I felt like it harmonized well with the different levels worked well during the fight scenes. Enjoyed the music.\\n\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(s)-\\n\\n\r\nThere are really only two main characters that we see on a regular basis and the problem is, well, they're pretty boring. There is no real development for our main hero and heroine because they've skipped so much time in the anime and we're not given time enough to get to know and like these characters. I think that the relationship between the two are rushed and is hard to believe. They are too perfect and have no flaws or interesting traits to them, basically they're two dimensional and have no depth to them. \\n\\n\r\n2/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall I think that the story and characters really dragged down SAO from being what it was hyped to be. And the problems are so huge that it's hard to over look them and enjoy the anime. From the time skipped, months at a time, I felt very disconnected from the world they presented because I felt as if I missed so much. So it's hard for me to really give SAO a good score because I believe it had great potential and premise. But overall I would give SAO a 4/10 for the problems mention above.",

            "content": "I heard all this hype about Sword Art Online. Any anime site worth its salt has heard of it. It's vaunted as one of the best animes of 2012, and I heard pretty good stuff about it! However if there's one rule about anime is that the more hyped it is, the more crushing when it turns out to be a disappointment. SAO is one of these.\r\nIt started out with an interesting premise: ten thousand people are locked into a virtual reality game, with no law or order. They must beat the game in order to get out. At the forefront is Kirito, a skilledplayer and one of the original players of the game. It sounds good on paper.\\n\\n\r\nThe issue with this is that Kirito is a borderline Gary Stu. He's the Ace, the secret weapon of the players, and all the player's hopes rides on his shoulders. Okay, apart from being a typical sounding shonen hero, that isn't anything special. What IS, however, is that he picks up a LOT of skills that become more and more often deus ex machinas. He steals the spotlight from every other character so everyone else, even our female protagonist, Asuna, can only stare in awe off to the side. \\n\\n\r\nAsuna went from a powerful, pretty awesome character to the love interest that every anime requires. Her powers and skills as co-leader of the best guild in the game gradually dwindle until she's little more than a plot point. The romance between the two is nonexistent, despite it being praised as one of the anime's strongest points. If this is supposed to be the strongest point, I'm glad I didn't exactly go into this with high expectations. I'm not sure the author knew how romance works and that this was wish fulfillment. News flash guys, girls don't hang out with you, eat with you for a few episodes, and then decide they want to marry you. That doesn't happen.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters, especially the female characters, all fall in love with Kirito. Why? I don't know; it isn't revealed. It's as if just being there is enough to charm everyone in sight. That was where I started dreading turning on my computer to watch this awful excuse for a romantic drama. They're shallow, one-dimensional, and bring little to no depth to the storyline whatsoever. They're only purpose is to long after Kirito, making it seem like a poorly written harem story.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is awful, despite having a strong premise. Go up a hundred floors (most of these aren't even shown), beat the boss, leave the game. Okaaay... what about leveling? Or getting better equipment? Interactions between guilds? Friendly duels? Anything NORMAL that you'd expect from an MMORPG? Nope, none of that is present, with the exception of illegal duels which eventually becomes murder cases (Kirito solves these, by the way). \\n\\n\r\nThe art is just... meh. It wasn't extraordinary and honestly looks like something I'd see out of a dime-a-dozen manga from 2006. No effects really seemed to catch my eye, and the scenery was just average. I expected more from a 2012 anime. \\n\\n\r\nSound? It does have a pretty nice opening, and the soundtrack is also nice, so if that's your thing, go for it. However, it's simply not enough to bring to the table. I had to force myself after episode fourteen to find episode fifteen and watch it. \\n\\n\r\nSAO is over-hyped. It  didn't live up to half the expectations I set, and I set pretty low standards. It's the perfect example of wish fulfillment to the highest degree.",

            "content": "*THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*\r\nSword Art Online is a pioneer of its genre in that, the source material dates from all the way back in 2002 (.hack// being of the same vintage).  This is important to note as with all pioneering feats, there is an initial sense of wonder and hype, followed by disappointment as the same concept is refined and improved upon.   To give an example, the Victorians pioneered the underground railway in London, a marvel at its time but it was soon realised that they dug the tunnels too small.  The tiny, overcrowded trains of today cannot be appreciated forits breakthrough in technology.  SAO, due to its nature therefore shows the same seemingly obvious flaws that only become apparent in hindsight.\\n\\n\r\nWith that said, SAO is a fantastic piece of work considering how the author was only a high school student at the time, and how he ventured into previously unexplored territory.   The author and the subsequent adaptation by A1 pictures successfully manages to impress the intended audience; the teenage market.  This is done through a careful blend of adventure, cliffhangers , pacing, deux es machinas and a good cast of girls.\\n\\n\r\nThe show starts off with a highly interesting premise with players in a perfectly modelled virtual reality.  Since their consciousness is surrendered to the NervGear hardware, the only way to return to the real world is through the \u201cLog Out\u201d button which has unfortunately gone walkies.  We follow the life events of our protagonist, Kirito as he battles his way through his ups and downs, which is not limited to fighting.\\n\\n\r\nKirito also faces a daunting challenge emotionally, as the stakes are exceptionally high.  A death in-game equates to death in real life.  These obstacles flesh out the human nature of Kirito\u2019s character in great detail.  His behaviour, emotions and actions are closely related to his recent happenings and experiences.  Kirito starts off as a social recluse who prefers to limit his interactions with other people.  This leads him to shun the cooperative nature of MMORPGs and plays solo.  Through a chance encounter, Kirito manages to befriend a group and re-learn the significance of friendship and comradeship, and how that improves his mental well-being.  This does not lead to the unrealistic result of Kirito becoming instantly socially adept, as he faces further obstacles and setbacks that push him back to his reclusive old self.  Such flaws truly show that Kirito is simply a mere mortal with variable emotions and feelings, which serves to connect with the viewer with empathy.  For Kirito is only the strongest player in SAO due to his effort and research, rather than simply being perfect.  Only through real experience can Kirito grow as a person, and the growth is closely tied in with the story.\\n\\n\r\nA1 Pictures is to be commended for only highlighting the most significant parts of Kirito\u2019s story as he fights to clear the game.  Thousands of hours of level-grinding which was normal in the Everquest era of 2002 (when SAO was written) has given way to achievement caps relating to the hours you play in a day in 2012 (when SAO was adapted).  To put it in simpler terms, the firms that make MMORPGs implementing such caps means the community has democratically voted with their wallets that level grinding is far too troublesome and boring.\\n\\n\r\nWe are therefore treated to relevant side stories instead of level-grinding filler.  Each of these side stories involves an encounter with a supporting cast with wide variations in personalities and nature of the quest.  Through the use of variety in the story, not only do we get to see Kirito develop, but also the world.  The viewer is introduced to the world of MMORPGs involving Guilds, Raids, Smithing, Conspiracy and even a compelling virtual romance that becomes the foundation of a timely rejuvenation of Kirito\u2019s character.  Relationships however, are a two-way street and Asuna\u2019s (the main heroine and Kirito\u2019s girlfriend) worldview is also seamlessly influenced, and improved.  The two-way nature of the relationship really makes it convincing, and leaves a lasting impression.  The end product is an Asuna, despite her obvious flaws as a human, becomes a character whom many would look up to, due to her dedicated and faithful nature that was born out of hardship.\\n\\n\r\nAll of the above really shows that the writers performed an exceptional job.  The accurate portrayal of the fickle nature of human emotions, and especially during the tumultuous years of adolescence really brings the show to life.  The level of language, and the tones used by the voice actors were highly appropriate.  They successfully avoid Kirito sounding like an aged professor with a PhD in SAO, and a realistic mix of rational decision making and emotionally-charged angst is used.\\n\\n\r\nThe quality of writing continues with the way the villains are portrayed.  The first major villain, Kayaba is an accurate rendition of the genius, lost in his own world, which he seeked to control.  He is the prime example of a person termed as a sociopath.  The best aspect of him however is not his character itself, but the way he integrated himself into the storyline, and produced the most unexpected plot twist.  This twist is a very crafty, and convincing one due to it being totally out of the blue yet in hindsight, perfectly plausible.\\n\\n\r\nThe second villain, Sugou on the other hand, is the purest example of a villain in recent times.  Villains are meant to be bad, but not all can be successful at being bad and unique at the same time.  A recent, highly successful example to compare is Raoul Silva, the highly-acclaimed villain in James Bond\u2019s Skyfall.  Not only was Silva bad, he was amusingly bad and obviously received pleasure from just being plain \u2018badass\u2019.  In SAO, Sugou betters Silva by not only bringing amusement, but also the purest feeling of disgust against the character.  In essence, Sugou is the victim of his own success, and the show goes to great extent by detailing his personality and motives.  The icing on the cake is when Sugou subjects Asuna to the unthinkable, further solidifying the author and A1\u2019s innovative risk-taking with the series.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough show is somewhat lacking in all-out battle action which comes across as strange, due to its highly suggestive title; the art of swordcraft,  the worry is misplaced.  The rarity of such scenes only serves to enhance the excitement during the boss battles.  The immersion is further exemplified by the convincing use of light effects during animated scenes.  This highly appropriate use of animation technique serves to amplify the effect of each, and every single hacking and slicing motion.  Instead of Diablo-style hack and slice spamming, we are treated with the significance of each motion.  A1 Pictures have clearly taken on board the mantra of quality over quantity.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, following the mantra means the show tried to cover too much, in too little time.  An attempt at too much quality in too little time.  SAO attempts to provide a realistic and varied portrayal of the world of MMOGs.  They have unfortunately made the pioneer\u2019s mistake of being far too ambitious.  Some characters are casted a little too far to the side and that includes those that greatly influenced Kirito\u2019s development being one-episode wonders.  This is especially evident in the \u2018Aria\u2019 sub-arc where A1 Pictures attempted to cover too much ground in a single episode when Asuna was introduced.  Nevertheless, while this may seem detrimental, the flip side is of course, the less intrusive nature of the side cast.  This approach avoids the trap of character bloat which other series have fallen into.  Despite the blunder with \u2018Aria\u2019, Asuna gets the focus she needs later in the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe excellent writing and animation is greatly amplified by the renowned composer, Kajiura Yuki who worked on the music.  The style of the music resembles her most recent previous work (Fate/Zero), but is sufficiently different to set it apart, reminiscent of the time she worked on  Mai-HiME and Tsubasa Chronicles back-to-back.  She forgoes her usual techno, and instead utilizes a greater reliance on classic instruments and the orchestra.  A highly appropriate decision as the art of swordsmanship and the resulting swordfights are traditional in nature.  Despite classical instruments being rather \u2018soft\u2019 in comparison with electronic music, Kajiura delivered beautifully with the softer style actually multiplying the effectiveness of the battle scenes.  Her mix of opera in the battle tracks only serves to give a sense of \u2018epic\u2019, seen in the likes of \u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nIt is important at this point to mention that SAO actually has two, highly distinct arcs.  The second arc is not a death game, but a race against time.  It also gives a much-needed change in pace from the seriousness that hung over the first arc.  Unfortunately, the benefits of a slightly light-hearted arc is also its downfall.  The sense of urgency from the race against time was not portrayed in the best manner, with Kirito taking seemingly pointless detours, which in actuality was in fact, perfectly reasonable.  A1 Pictures disappointed in this regard, disconnecting the viewer with the character\u2019s decision-making.  Nevertheless, the detours sets the foundations of Kirito developing in the real world, and explores his relationship with people that are the closest to him.  Aside from the minor drawback, the quality of writing is still very good (but not excellent) and the quality of animation and music is maintained.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the excellence of the individual components (e.g. sound, animation) come together at the end to give the viewer an anime that is pleasant to see, awe-inspiring to hear, and minds in intrigue with the story.  A1 Pictures has successfully created an adaptation that entertains a wide variety of audiences.  SAO is a must watch for fans of adventure, fantasy, romance and even harem.  Even the detractors derived a whole new level of entertainment, expressed in forms not limited to reaction videos on YouTube.  The product\u2019s success is clearly seen through pure, objective evidence by means of Blu-Ray sales as viewers have overwhelmingly embraced SAO.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, SAO gets an excellent 9/10.  A truly enjoyable series that crosses an extremely wide range of anime fanbases which is no mean feat.  It is probably fair to deduct a single point in light of the slight weakness in \u2018Aria\u2019 and in the second arc but not any more than that due to the amount of ground that required covering in order to complete Kirito\u2019s development.\\n\\n\r\nNow that I\u2019ve mentioned \u2018Aria\u2019, there is another anime of the same name.  This series must never be watched, for it involves girls simply rowing boats for 3 whole seasons.  Worst of all, a \u2018moeblob\u2019 (in other words, \u2018moe[brown stuff]\u2019) loli character is introduced, being evidenced by her having an S-tier Zettai Ryouiki.  The wise community must avoid such monstrosity going after easy cash and stick to shows of a deep and profound nature, such as SAO.",

            "content": "Yes! Yeeees! Oh, let me taste your tears, Asuna! \r\nMm, your tears are so yummy and sweet!\r\nOh, the tears of unfathomable sadness! Yummy~\r\nIn a world where series' like Harry Potter, or other real abhorrent fanfiction tittles the likes of Twilight sells well enough for multiple sequels, it shouldn't be a surprise then, Sword Art Online's popularity skyrocketing that is. Pretty posters, familiarity, perhaps male power fantasies and the like, etc. There are numerous factors that play a part in a works' popularity; but it's hard to pin-point just what exactly got SAO such hype. Especially since it becomes apparent that it was already losing it'sfocus just after the third episode. In a similar vein to SAO's sister in terms of popularity still that very same year, Guilty Crown also had an (ostensibly) enormous fanbase even before it aired. It's a mystery really. \\n\\n\r\nSAO is a clear indication that it's target audience are easy to profit from. Which is exactly why it makes it just the kind of anime that makes you wonder about where the anime industry could be heading. It is not a positive influence. And unfortunately for the supporters, SAO does provide with more than enough empirical evidence to tell them that it is garbage but, that would be unfair as there actually is entertainment value to be had here.\\n\\n\r\nIn the visual department SAO definitely excels, maybe not enough to make a graphic artist have wet dreams over, though. From the character designs to the very world which they reside in, it is all aesthetically pleasing. And while consistent and fluid in it's animation, it's a little rough around the edges during the fight scenes. There's an abuse of stills to express 'action', and distorted facial expressions used in an otherwise uneventful location (was that actually intended to be used for comedic effect? Welp). Of course, this alone wouldn't damper the experience. If everything else were intact, this would remain relatively unnoticed. \\n\\n\r\nAn interesting concept? A Charismatic main character? world building? SAO had just about everything working in it's favor to make it anime of that year. But even with the few legitimate merits it has it does away with them in favor of, well, to make our hero The Black Swor- wait, no one actually confuses to whom that tittle belongs to, right..? - Kirito, more of a flawless gary stu. \\n\\n\r\nAll complete with enough deus ex-machinas to make you puke.\\n\\n\r\nThousands of players dying? All off-screen and no one gives a crap about statistics. Boss fights? Essentially, a grand total of three and they don't re-spawn.You never really get a sense of dread in the world of SAO. Even the very first death was due to a player refusing to take a life potion. And that's all in the first half of the series. The second half? Not even going to touch it. Unless, of course, we're talking about Suguha's sugus here.\\n\\n\r\nAnd as you can imagine, with it taking itself so seriously already, when it come to the uh... romance the end result is laughable. Later on, at one point Asuna said something around the lines of, \"Kirito has changed me, everything I am as it is now is because of him\". I started to cringe at that point, none of what she said happened. The characterization suffers almost as much as the writing; or vice versa. Every villain is cartoonishly evil and every supporting character doesn't fair any better either. All of the 'character development' happens during the constant time skips, successfully nullifying it and making for a heavily disjointed pacing. And It doesn't help that the script is akin to that of an eroge. Meaning: A) relationships take on a surrealistic fast pace. B) can't hear a confession a foot away from you. C) Being nice is enough to attract females from all corners of the land, etc.\\n\\n\r\nSAO could very well be suggesting you to be a Infidelity-committing, sister-fornicating, misogynistic pedophile who loves rape as fanservice. Topped only by those slimy tentacles everyone likes. -- It doesn't encourage anything positive, it's too delusional to do so. All the gamer pandering, multiple relationships, etc. It only serves to further take away any sense of realism it might have had, including it's potential to construct a society within a virtual world; firmly planting it into wish-fulfillment territory. \\n\\n\r\nSplendorous action - this is the only reason I can think of as to why I would recommend this show. And yet, despite all that, knowing that it falls off the rails, crashes and burns; it get's back on the tracks again, and again only to end up crashing. \\n\\n\r\nIt's fun, if only to mock it.",

            "content": "I might as well skip the plot synopsis of Sword Art Online, because odds are you already know it. Sword Art Online has utterly exploded. It is all over the place. It is that one show the EVERYONE is watching, whether it be through genuine interest or sheer bile fascination. And amidst this, it has split the anime fandom enormously between those who utterly love it and those who absolutely hate it. As you no doubt checked what I scored this before anything else, you can probably tell I'm in the latter camp.\r\nIn the event that you've been living under a rock these past 6months, Sword Art Online revolves around an online game that allows full immersion, that all of it's players soon become trapped in via the classic \"you die here, you die in the real world\" plot device. All the game's players are now trapped in a brutal survival game, as per a ton of other anime that you have doubtlessly watched at least one of before. SAO's first and most obvious fault even to someone who hasn't watched it would be that the premise is incredibly generic - it's just a cobbling-together of Mirai Nikki and .Hack, amongst others, and neither were very good to start with.\\n\\n\r\nBut for all my complaints with the series SAO scrapped itself together from, at least those series bothered with a coherent narrative. SAO's story is an inconsistent and appallingly-paced trainwreck, jumping through numerous ill-placed timeskips and sudden shifts in the style of the story in a way that is, to make an understatement of it, very jarring.\\n\\n\r\nThe series goes through several stages. The first is confined to episode 1, AKA the only good episode. It serves to set up the plot, and does a decent enough job of it. However, rather than following said plot, it quickly switches to episodic journeys through the world our protagonist is trapped in. In theory that isn't such a terrible idea, but any promise it had is ruined by drearily slow pacing, and more importantly, the most mind-numbingly flat Gary Stu viewer self-insertion blank slate of a protagonist you could possibly imagine. His sole character trait is that he is an extremely powerful player (worse yet, any development into such a powerful player happens offscreen).\\n\\n\r\nAround the episode 9 mark, the actual plot starts to take place. Kirito, the aforementioned dullard emotion-bot protagonist, befriends Asuna, a similarly one-dimensional fellow player he met in an earlier episode, and through a series of events is dragged into joining her guild, who plan to take on the final boss of SAO. In the process of this, the two become romantically involved. Sorry, did I say the plot happened here? My mistake, it actually gets thrown out the window at the first hint of romance. The whole \"escaping SAO\" plot is put on hold for several episodes while Kirito and Asuna's romantic \"subplot\" takes over. This doesn't seem that bad until you remember that Kirito and Asuna are totally one-dimensional. Fittingly enough, their romance feels forced and completely fake. How they even \"fall in love\" is totally ignored - they just do.\\n\\n\r\nEventually, they get a move on with the damned plot, and *SPOILER ALERT* - everything comes to an extremely rushed and sudden conclusion (especially jarring due to how drearily slow everything was before), and they manage to beat SAO, in spite of some major leaps of logic involving how it actually happened. At last, everyone can escape this wretched game, and continue with their lives. Happy ending!\\n\\n\r\n...Wait a tick. Why are there still 11 episodes left?\\n\\n\r\n\"Oh right, there's still good money to make off this series. We can't end it just yet! Let's draw it out a bit longer... I dunno, pull some bullshit subplot out of nowhere. Just make some stuff up.\"\\n\\n\r\nIn a nutshell, Sore Arse Online managed to drag itself out. Another online game, Alfheim Online, manages to get involved in the plot, using some leftover technology from SAO. Kirito has to enter this game as well, along with his sister (who is actually his cousin, which somehow makes the romantic siscon undertones not as bad).\\n\\n\r\n...OK, I'll stop now. Anyway, the most generous thing I can say about his sister is that unlike Kirito and Asuna, she at least has a personality. For better or worse, since her personality is that of a completely insufferable melodramatic whining brat. She's not the only terrible character introduced in this arc, though... we also get the villainous mastermind behind Alfheim Online, who starts off overly and campily evil and just keeps getting more heinous from there. At every opportunity, the series will remind you that he is evil in new and terrible ways. You will quickly get the point, but SAO will keep shoving it down your throat. Even his eventual comeuppance is more uncomfortable than cathartic.\\n\\n\r\nSo there's SAO in four parts. It's an uneven, shifting, poorly-planned mess. It's characters are awful. It's plot is awful. It's pacing is awful. Short of it's decent production job, everything in SAO is awful.\\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend you stay offline.\\n\\n\r\nThat pun was awful.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Words: More like BORED ART ONLINE, amirite?\\n\\n\r\nStory/Plot: 1/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 2/10\\n\r\nAnimation/Art: 7/10\\n\r\nMusic: 7/10\\n\r\nActing: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nFor Fans Of: .Hack, Mirai Nikki",

            "content": "This is a review of Sword Art Online\u2019s adaptation. I do not care for the light novels, this review is based entirely on the anime adaptation. \r\nThe Story (4/10)\r\nThe plot for this anime falls below that of an average seasonal anime. Sword Art Online begins with a good, interesting premise. The first two episodes are actually very promising. However, once you get past those initial episodes the show doesn\u2019t really do anything of interest and feels like it was written by a sexually frustrated teenager. As I said, the concept is good and somewhat tragic. A new virtual reality MMO opens up and thousands ofplayers begin grinding away, only to find they cannot log out of the game and are stuck in this virtual world. There are so many possibilities and interesting things to be done with this premise. Sadly, it\u2019s all wasted. Forced romance, time skips, filler and a random love triangle plague this anime.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not that the story is dreadful, it\u2019s just that it was incredibly mediocre when there was so much to be done with it. Disappointing. And that\u2019s without mentioning the second half of the series, which is legitimately awful. Seriously, if you are going to waste your time on this show for whatever reason, just drop it when you get to the halfway point. You\u2019ll know when you\u2019re there. There\u2019s a load of bullshit, Gary Sue, rule-breaking nonsense. I could go on all day, but then I\u2019d have to give actual spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation (8/10)\\n\r\nVery solid, actually. High production value and nothing to complain about really. Other than the fact that this decently-sized budget was wasted on a terrible show. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nAhh, Kajiura Yuki. A shame his time was wasted on this tripe. Honestly, it\u2019s not one of his best works. It fit the on-screen stuff but nothing really stood out. The first opening by LiSA is great, however. Possibly the best thing to come of this series. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (2/10)\\n\\n\r\nNope, nope, nope. I can deal with silly characters like Yui from K-On. I can deal with whiney characters like Shinji. But the whole point of this main character is wish fulfilment. He\u2019s a self-insert; an antisocial, somewhat pathetic, MMO playing teenager. I\u2019m not sure if they were trying to make a character as close to the intended audience as possible, but they damn well succeeded. He\u2019s then somehow amazing and brilliant at the game purely because he did some beta testing. In fact, he even defies the rules of the game. The hard-coded rules matter not to this Gary Sue! He also becomes some sort of courageous leader, somehow. He changes in the series but there\u2019s no character development. He just kind of decides to be different. \\n\\n\r\nNow for the female cast. I\u2019m sorry, but how is this loser surrounded by attractive young women? Why are so many attractive young women even on this game? Way to ruin any suspension of disbelief. The female lead, Asuna, was perhaps the one character with some potential. Unfortunately, just like the premise of this show, the potential goes to waste and they turn what should have been a strong female lead into a damsel in distress. \\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion (4/10)\\n\\n\r\nThis series is below what I\u2019d consider average, even with the high production value. If the second cour never happened this might have been above average for me, but the latter half was just too awful. If you are the target audience for this show (a teenage male who enjoys playing MMOs) then you may very well like this series. It is watchable, and some episodes are pretty good. Think of this as the Twilight of anime; there are occasional good moments, but to actually enjoy the whole thing you need to be a specific type of person. \\n\\n\r\nI would not recommend this show to anyone outside of the aforementioned target audience. Those people will probably love this series, but to everyone else you\u2019ll probably feel that you\u2019ve wasted your time. Good premise ruined by childish wish fulfilment. \\n",

            "content": "Story:\r\n\"Sword Art Online\" or SAO takes our younger generation's fantasy into reality. A virtual reality world. One filled with excitement, beauty, and opportunities to always get stronger. An MMORPG that's more real than reality.\r\nIf you play games at all, you'll probably feel an attachment right off the first episode. That dream where you sometimes wish you could've been in another world as we..\r\nThe story gets a 10 from me, I hope the story progresses in the same way as episode 1.  Being attached to a show is important to enjoy it, and I think this story does it exceptionally well.\r\nArt:\r\nThe art is beautiful, similarto many other animes made with today's technology. The virtual world seems alive with the beautiful art and I can't ask for more.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nBoth OP and ED was engaging and done beautifully.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nOur protagonist Kirito seems to be a skilled gamer in SAO because he has experience in the beta version of it. Kirito has a bit of an introvert personality, and seems to be an addicted gamer who has passion to finish this game. He loved SAO beta, and wants to grow in SAO live as well. He seems to have some reason to dislike reality, or at the very least enjoys virtual reality more. He makes a statement that he feels more alive in SAO than real life.\\n\\n\r\nHe meets a good nooby friend Cline right at the first episode, and instead of pushing noobs away like most people would he decided to help him out. Kirito shows an introverted personality whenever Cline talks about meeting up with his other friends, but Kirito also shows compassion for Cline when things get bad.\\n\\n\r\nI believe Kirito will show growth in SAO, and I'm sure we'll see the reason behind some of his characteristics soon. In just the first episode it was revealed he's a strong person. Not many people can be calm after facing a life and death reality. Asuna hasn't made an appearance yet, we'll see how she is in the next episode!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nLoved the first episode, and hope it continues this way! What I'm scared of the most is a crappy ending. Not every1 probably feels the same way as me in this aspect but if the anime catches up to the novel (which I have not read) I rather they use fillers and such or slow it down than to put a bad ending in.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nAs a person who plays a lot of games, SAO has been one of the first animes to make me come in and write a review on. This is because I've been waiting for an anime with a plot like this that doesn't disappoint (.Hack XD) and I hope it continues this way!",

Going in expecting an enjoyable experience, I was completely let down. SAO is probably the most overrated anime so far\r\nBoth the art and sound were done extremely well, as expected from such a high budget anime. \r\nBeing a gamer myself, i was intrigued by the story, but it was terribly executed.\r\nTo me, the characters are the greatest downfall of this anime. The main leads, Kirito and Asuna, are some of the most unrealistic and boring characters. Kirito, with absolutely noflaws, a ladiesman despite being a shut-in, changes his personality ridiculously. He acts completely different when facing different characters just to fit the required story at that point and changes from a cool loner to a bloody family man. Makes no sense. And with the ever perfect Asuna, no flaws or defining traits of any kind, make up some of the most uninteresting duo in anime history. Even the side characters are weak for side characters. The only character i would remotely stand was Suguha, at least see had an inch of depth.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe i had too high expectations, but this anime was terrible for me. And it got worst and worst as it continued until it was absolutely unbearable\\n\\n\r\nAn anime which doesn't deserve the attention it gets, i do not recommend this. Don't expect much, or in fact, expect anything at all.",

            "content": "Sword Art Online has become a phenomenon in the anime community. Since it has premiered it has gained both a large amount of fame and infamy. Nowadays it's really known for the latter, and seen as intensely mediocre by a lot of people. My thoughts on the matter probably won't be as articulate as some other people's, but I'll try my best to explain why I think SAO is a terrible anime.\r\nWhen I first heard of SAO's premise, I was already put off. While I understand that it has potential, it just sounded very fanfic-y to me and not really that appealing, which is whyit didn't really become one of those shows where I was like \"MUST WATCH\". Sometime later the infamy just caught up to me and I decided it wouldn't hurt to have a look-see.\\n\\n\r\nThe premise of SAO is essentially that some douchebag named Akihiko Kayaba trapped a bunch of people in the eponymous Sword Art Online for...reasons. The story follows Kirito, a lone gamer, as he strives to make it through to the end of the game safely, as losing in the game equals death in real life as well. On the way he also falls in love with a girl named Asuna.\\n\\n\r\nBefore getting into the main problems of the story, let me begin by addressing the \"strong\" points of the show as it were.\\n\\n\r\nThe show IS occasionally pretty in terms of visuals, however to say that it is artistically good is giving it a little bit too much credit. The character designs are honestly nothing special; they aren't vomit-inducing by any means, but they are pretty generic anime designs. They have a certain appeal but are nothing special. The armor and monster designs are also pretty uninspired and look like they were created by amateurs. It reminds me of the Tales series, whose art direction I also am not a fan of. This is no Final Fantasy XIV that's for sure.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is by Yuki Kajiura, who also worked on Madoka Magica (which is a MUCH better show than this piece of shit). It's a decent score, granted, but it's nothing too outstanding and doesn't in any way make up for the huge pitfalls that are the story and characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is very, very poorly paced, has terrible focus, and jumps the shark so quickly it's scary. The first episode is promising enough (though again, calling it excellent is a stretch); it sets up the stakes, gives a nice amount of tension, introduces the protagonist and main villain, and leaves you hopeful. Kirito is hardly an interesting character at first glance, but that's forgivable because it's only the first episode. The second episode introduces the supposed main female character, Asuna, and fleshes out the setting a bit more. It's nothing fantastic but the plot progresses a little and stuff actually does happen.\\n\\n\r\nWhat follows afterwards however are like 5 episodes of irrelevant BS interspersed with incredibly poorly written, adolescent drama that feels like it belongs in fanfiction.  The majority of the episodes are just propping up Kirito by having him win the affections of various girls in different ways, while also occasionally giving him a cheap source of angst for him to fuss over. The setting does get fleshed out more, but the thing is that this ultimately ends up being completely irrelevant to what BECOMES the main plot.\\n\\n\r\nAnd what is the main plot? Kirito and Asuna's romance. And let me tell you, it sucks. It's incredibly forced, dull, and rushed. The majority of the development of their relationship happens off-screen, it does not feel natural or realistic in the slightest. What it feels like is that it was written as an otaku's fantasy version of what a relationship would actually resemble, because they lack the knowledge of how such a thing actually works, and how to convincingly portray it through writing.\\n\\n\r\nIt really astounds me as to how much of a cancerous tumor the entire thing turned out to be; they SERIOUSLY go into the woods to have a vacation and raise a kid while their fucking lives are on the line. I thought they were supposed to be trying to fight for their lives and go home? I understand Kirito is all about escapism and how this world feels real to him bla bla bla but this isn't executed in a mature and sophisticated way so it just feels like a stupid waste of time. \\n\\n\r\nKirito ends up defeating Kayaba through Deus Ex Machina (the power of love overpowers even videogame rules, how about that), and then we go into another bullshit arc that introduces a lot of other nonsense like Kirito's boring one-dimensional adopted sister who's in love with him (gee i haven't seen this incestuous imouto stuff in like every other bad anime ever) and an even more awful villain than the first arc. \\n\\n\r\nIn summation, the plot of SAO COMPLETELY failed to deliver on its potential. Instead of exploring philosophical, moral, and ethical questions about the setting and situation and doing good legitimate worldbuilding (which it at least seemed to be trying to do earlier on, albeit poorly), it threw all of that away to focus on a terrible love story. What the hell was even the point of writing this in the first place? The entire tension that was supposed to be felt was just not there, and with the second arc it just evaporates completely. It is the EXACT opposite of a compelling narrative, it's childish and amateurish writing at its most apparent.\\n\\n\r\nWith that out of the way, the characters in SAO are all bad. Kirito is little more than a blank slate for anime and videogame otaku to project themselves onto; he has a super edgy black coat and sword, he has a SUPER SPESHUL DUBBL SWORDS power exclusive to him (so much for SAO being fair), all the girls want him, everyone wants to be him, he has a super kawaii waifu who cooks for him, gets to play parent with a not-really child, saves the day even though everything says he shouldn't be able to, etc. He's as dull as dishwater. Calling him the \"Black Swordsman\" is an insult to Guts, the actual Black Swordsman.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters are all similarly paper thin and boring. Asuna starts out as an affirmative, tough female protagonist (though not an interesting one by any means), but gradually gets demoted to useless domestic waifu while her hubby Kirito does the actual heavy lifting. The misogynistic undertones present are honestly pretty gross.\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters are mostly irrelevant and pointless. The girls of the week are just flimsy archetypes and little more than that, they serve no purpose in the grander narrative at all. Lisbeth is easily the best one, and one I actually did kind of like, but I'm not going to pretend she was anything special either. While I say all of this, I do agree that Klein is pretty bro from what we see of him and that if he was the main character instead SAO probably would have been a much more tolerable series, because Klein at least seemed to have some semblance of a personality.\\n\\n\r\nThe villains are terrible and have no actual reasons for what they are doing besides the fact that they are bad people. Worse than that, they are not charismatic or interesting in spite of that, like Johann Liebert from Monster, Griffith from Berserk, Hannibal Lecter, etc. They just suck.\\n\\n\r\nThe main thing that keeps rearing its ugly head over and over again in all the things that are wrong with SAO is just how incredibly masturbatory it is. It seems strictly designed to fellate the main character (a stand-in for game and anime otaku), pandering to its demographic as much as possible, instead of focusing on delivering a focused narrative with compelling writing. Literally every single attempt this show makes at drama or generally invoking pathos falls completely flat because Kawahara obviously doesn't understand humans or the basics of writing enough to get emotional reactions that aren't mirthful laughter, disgust, annoyance, apathy or boredom.\\n\\n\r\nI get that this is a shounen story and I shouldn't expect that much from it to begin with, but that doesn't mean it has to be terrible.\\n\\n\r\nAs elitist as it sounds to say this, the only reason I can see anyone propping this up as anything more than serviceable/mediocre is that they just haven't watched enough anime or read enough manga or just experienced enough stories in general to know there's SO MUCH BETTER STUFF OUT THERE. Seriously, even if you just wanted harem or moe stuff, there are better shows than this out there.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Sword Art Online. I don't think it's an exaggeration to rank this as one of the most hyped anime series of 2012. That being said, one only has to take a cursory glance at any SAO related forums, discussions et cetera to see for oneself - that SAO is undoubtedly a series dogged by controversy.\r\nFans of SAO are so devoted to it that they will leap into every discussion to defend any perceived slight at their beloved anime. On the other hand, people who detest it tend to make an almighty fuss about everything that has to do with it.\r\nTo be frank, I was actuallypretty fired up by the hype surrounding SAO and was anticipating an anime that was brilliantly presented, on par with the likes of Steins;Gate and Fate/Zero.\\n\\n\r\nThe first episode indeed lived up to all my expectations. We have a bunch of players trapped in a massive virtual world and a raving mad scientist ruling over said world. Throw in an additional quirk, dying in-game means a horribly real death in the real world. I could wax lyrical about the limitless opportunities this premise offered up! The second episode followed this up with a well delivered boss fight and excellent story development. Hope burned bright in the souls of many SAO fans.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, all good things come to an end, and for SAO, it was disappointingly a whole 22 episodes earlier than expected.\\n\\n\r\nCue the main protagonist, Kirito suddenly transforming from a well thought out character into a cliched knight in shining armour. A Gary Stu to boot, perfect in every respect.\\n\\n\r\nThe few episodes go something like this.\\n\r\nA girl has a worry. Kirito pokes his nose in it. He miraculously manages to come up with a perfectly viable plan to solve the girl's problems and manages to execute it flawlessly every single time. The girl then suddenly develops romantic feelings towards her knight in shining armour a.k.a the one and only Kirito-kun. He's practically a stereotypical Gary Stu!\\n\\n\r\nIf it were a single episode interspersed in between the main story arcs I don't think anyone would have complained. But no! The studio in all its great wisdom decided to string 'em together in one almost unbearably long series of episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe main grouse I have with this portion of the anime is that is does not have any bearing on the overall plot of the anime. See those cute girls that have befriended Kirito? They get one episode together in the limelight with him, and then fade away into the darkness. Helping someone get an item? Tell me how that's going to impact on the future plotline of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nWhew. Now that I've got that out of my system, let's move on to rating the anime. \\n\\n\r\nI gave the story a 5. Essentially, SAO is a jumbled up mix of episodes that each do the main concept of the anime no favours at all. First we have the filler episodes. Then we have huge leaps in time. Heck, the first seven episodes spanned one and a half years, yet the rest of it up to the end of the SAO arc only took a few months. Ever heard of pacing, people? That pissed me off no end. I was expecting them to pace the SAO arc over the whole 25 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe one major problem in this area is that the people in charge either took excessive artistic licence or were high on something, because SAO is as filled with holes as a block of Swiss cheese in terms of plotholes. Basically we have logic defying actions, even within the rules of the SAO world. On one occasion, the anime even blatantly contradicts itself, feeding us the ridiculous idea that pure willpower and love can counter the rules of said world. Come on, give us a break. That's just a blatant deus ex machina!\\n\\n\r\nThen we have ALO, or Alfheim Online.\\n\\n\r\n I won't spoil any people yet to watch SAO any further. Suffice to say that SAO's story and execution as a whole are mediocre, extending to the ALO arc. Its only saving grace is that the plot twists are quite well executed and unexpected when they are not logic defying.\\n\\n\r\nArt-wise I have no particular complaints to make. The art as a whole is solid stuff, especially in a few scenes that are a feast for the eyes. A 7 overall.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the sound. \\n\r\nThe first OP, LiSA's crossing field was decent. Not bad, but not too good either, a hallmark of her songs. First ED, forgettable, generic and very plain indeed. I feel that the second OP was a shade better than crossing field. And finally, the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance, the 2nd ED, Overfly. In my opinion it was actually a great song. Haruna Luna's not half bad. The soundtracks were done by Kajiura Yuki. Need I say more? 8 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters! Now we're getting serious. I mean DEAD serious.\\n\r\nA breakdown :\\n\\n\r\nKirito - Every part of him shouts Gary Stu! He is the modern day Sherlock Holmes with wonderful deduction ability. He is a chick magnet without even trying to. He always goes out of his way to help people. He even gets a wife after non-existent courtship! He's even got his own unique Dual Wield sword skill because he's just that badass! \"Make me a sammich and a rabbit stew, Asuna!\" \"Okay!\"\\n\\n\r\nAsuna - The female protagonist. When we first see her, she appears as a strong character, with the personality and traits to match as well. Granted, she does play some important roles in the earlier stages of the SAO arc. After that, she degenerates into Kirito's sidekick. What, you're among the top in your guild hierarchy and a front liner to boot, yet Kirito has to fight for your freedom from your guild? For some honeymoon so that you can spend your lovey-doey couple time together? She gets even worse in the ALO arc. Basically, Asuna is there to help Kirito on the road to awesomeness. Whenever she's in a spot of trouble, cue Kirito stepping in and coolly getting rid of her problems, be it enemies, monsters or otherwise. No point in her existing otherwise, is there?\\n\\n\r\nThese two are the only two that SAO really focuses on. The supporting cast are merely there to cheer them on. They play no major role and do not impact the storyline. Some even appear in only one episode!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - A really bad one. 3 from 10. It would have been lower if Yui didn't at least appear to compliment the Kirito-Asuna pairing. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - I'm going to give it a deserving 7. I will concede that although the story and characters are immensely lacking, I quite enjoyed the series. Between facepalming at those god awful plotholes to being absorbed in the beautiful world of SAO, it's actually quite an enjoyable experience.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, SAO is probably an anime series that polarises opinion like never before. I'm going to take a neutral stand here and say that I neither detest nor love it. Else there's probably gonna be another SAO flame war.\\n\\n\r\nThe source material by the author is excellent, but suffers very badly when being adapted by those \"What the fuck are they smoking, they're so high\" people from A-1 Pictures. \\n\\n\r\nI'm giving it a 6. Seeing as the light novel is selling as fast as Kirito attracts chicks, I'll go out on a limb here and say I'm very hopeful of a further season 2.\\n\\n\r\nNow, if only they would kick A-1 out and replace them with a better studio... \\n",

            "content": "\"It's shit right?\"\r\n\"It's shit.\"\r\nShit Art Online, is essentially, shit. I don't even need to delve deep into this. It's laced with god awful writing, and panders to every autistic teenager on the planet. It's like a kid's fantasy, put onto paper and given a budget. Any teenager with angst could write this plot, and write it better than the hack of a writer that got it published. \r\nOur protagonist, Gary Stu, is the best ever. He gets the best drops and weapons. He's one of the only players to get a unique skill. He gets the boss kills. He gets the most beautiful girl inthe game, who also, coincidentally, is one of the best players. He also gets his own harem of good looking females, in a game which is supposed to make up of a small female population. He beats the game (Hurr Durr what a surprise) and saves everyone. My hero!\\n\\n\r\nBut why? Was it through character development? The power of friendship? Luck? No, no, and no. It's just because he does. Because he's the main character. Because the author loves his fantasy, where he is the alpha male, and where every desire can be fulfilled.\\n\\n\r\nIt's called self-insert. It's what you are doing. Stop it. It ruins the fun for everyone else.\\n\\n\r\nNow, there is nothing wrong with having a fantasy. But when you go and rate a show a 10, which has more plot holes than a hooker has STD\u2019s, we have a serious problem. \\n\\n\r\nDespite the whole \"death game\" concept, there is no danger whatsoever thanks to Mr. Emoangstsoloplayer. Anyone who dies does it off screen, or we are told about it. Or, we meet them for as long as it takes to remember their vague design, and then they get killed off. What was her name again? Huh funny, I can\u2019t remember since she was on screen for 10 minutes. So it's almost like they didn't die at all. Now that kept me on the edge of my seat. And then the one time someone should die, he doesn\u2019t! Holy shit how\u2019d that happen?!? Fucking magic, man I tell ya.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnd there\u2019s plenty of times where someone should die, but through some magical ass pull, save themselves and accomplish what they set out to do anyway. What\u2019s the point in suspense if we already know the outcome? Jumping on a dragon to escape a giant pit? Why even have scientific laws that prevent people from doing the impossible when they can pull shit like this? This isn\u2019t a super robot show, where the explicitly tell you to kick logic to the curb. Pathetically, the show tries to force a sense of realism down my throat I can\u2019t swallow.\\n\\n\r\nThere's also a lack of depth to every character. The villain makes the game because HE CAN, Asuna stands there and looks pretty, the more interesting side characters (Klein, Gilbert and I had to look those names up, I wanted to say red hair and black guy) get swept aside by Mr. Gay personified and become wallpaper. The protagonist couldn\u2019t be any more of a teenage faggot. I've had enough with these cardboard thin backgrounds and personalities; kill them off and be done with it. I'm in a kiddie pool and drowning here, even though it's shallow like this stories writing.\\n\\n\r\nThe Op by LiSa is by far the best thing about this show besides the quality budget. It's a good thing Asuna's ass won't look ugly, because there is nothing else to look at here folks. Seriously, I found at least 10 moments where a females ass took up half the screen in plain sight. Have the decency to at least put it in the background. We all know who your marketing is targeted towards.\\n\\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t even mention the horrid pacing. The show attempts to cram big chunks of story into singular episodes and falls flat on its face. How am I supposed to come to relate to a character if I only know them for a short period of time? Yet somehow these girls come to fall in love with the main character, within 10-15 minutes of meeting the! It\u2019s asinine how a logical human being can call that development. I shall point it out again; it\u2019s all for the sake of the fantasy. A romance show you say? Excuse me while I fall into a fit of uncontrollable laughter.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nShit Art Online\u2019s writing is equivalent to that of an Inuyasha fan fiction written by an overweight fujoshi. The writer was a very young man when he wrote the first novel, as apparent by his lack of talent or any of resemblance of skill. \u201cTwo years\u2019 worth of semen made a glopping noise as it flowed endlessly into Asuna.\u201d Now I realize this line is novel only, but it does mean something when it comes to the show. Do you really think a man, who could seriously and EARNESTLY write a line like that, could write a good story? Doesn\u2019t that line just make you want to crack up? And can anyone tell me what a glopping noise sounds like?\\n\\n\\n\r\nMust sound like shit.\\n",

            "content": "Sword art online is not one about action, but instead is a pseudo harem monomyth despite what the first episode suggests. It implores the same marketing tactic as Accel World, and Guilty Crown, where the 1st episode is merely a showstopper/crowd-pleaser with alot of eye candy and flashing lights as well as a misleading title, in order to accrue a sizeable fanbase. But if we ignore the 1st episode, and look at the anime as a whole it can be said that the anime was adequate for its intended purpose.\r\n//Story\r\nThe story is quite simple, and it seemed to copy the core ideas of hack//sign, butto a lesser extent, that is it focuses more on romance rather than action after the 1st episode. The story seems to advance rather too quickly after the 1st episode, where it seems to bounce from the 1st floor, to the 50th floor in a mere episode. As an aside just to explain the floors, the anime featured a large tower which the hero must climb, similar to that of Druga, that featured floor 1 to 100 that had a very powerful boss awaiting on the top floor. So it was quite clear that the 2nd episode sparked large displeasure/controversy in the audience. So just to reiterate an important point, the plot moves very fast, it was expected there to be minor 'time' leaps and that the entire anime would revolve around climbing the tower that was featured in the anime to be the ultimate obstacle to freedom. But that was not the case. Sword art Online's story ended mid-season, in a rather, pathetic fashion. For a damsel-in-distress or monomyth anime, in regards to the 2nd portion of the anime, it did amazingly so in it's portrayal, but as an action-game anime, it failed miserably. The plot moved too fast, the romance seemed to be forced, for example where suddenly two protagonists get together in a romantic relationship almost seemingly out of nowhere (though there were small hints), and the fact that the circumstances which brought this about in the anime was unrealistic. The manga on sword art online could explain clearly why people in the virtual game could live as well as other questions on the context of the world of Sword Art, but the anime failed to explain adequately such small questions, resulting in an un-cohesive/disjointed anime with too many questions to be asked about the world. So if a person watched only the anime, without reference to any of the  written works of Sword Art Online, the anime seemed to be fundamentally confusing. Sci-fi worlds must have depth, Sword Art Online lacked depth due it's seemingly short time frame.\\n\\n\r\n//Art and Sound\\n\r\nThe art and sound is something you'd expect to be top notch in an eyecandy anime like this, the first opening song, \"Crossing fields\" by LiSA seemed to resonate with the anime very well. Other notable mentions are, Innocence by Aoi Eir (2nd opening), Yume Sekai by Haruka Tomatsu (1st ED), and Overfly by Luna Haruna (2nd ED). The music in the anime was pretty well done, and seemed to blend well with the situations depicted in the anime. \\n\\n\r\n//Character\\n\r\nThe MC seems to be the most random personality on the anime, he's indecisive at times, a genius at times in decision making, and may other inconsistencies with his character. In the monomyth structure, where the hero saves the 'damsel in distress' the hero seems to become stronger, more intelligent or at least improve in character as the story progresses, with Kirito( MC), the reverse seems to happen. So as character progression goes, there seems to be regression rather progression in the case of the MC. The other characters, seemingly very vague, despite the anime being a fantasy. Other animes such as Hunter x Hunter, go out of they way to explain the background of side characters that are going to die in the next episode. Though I don't expect Sword Art Online to have this kind of depth in it's 25 episode anime( which could've been split into seperate seasons to make it seem less rushed, especially at the end), it could've at least explained more about the important female characters that turned the emotionally stagnant Kirito into a Cloud Strife. \\n\\n\r\n//Enjoyment\\n\r\nI can't say I didn't enjoy the anime, but the appalling story development and heavily flawed characters make it difficult to progress with the anime. The story seems to jump at random speeds; from very fast, to slow, to fast, to very fast (at the end). The ending of the anime reminds me of Avatar Kora where the last episode seems to be 6 episodes smashed into one episode. So for enjoyment I'd say I'd be a 6 or a 7. \\n\\n\\n\r\n//Verdict\\n\r\nOverall, due to the reason stated above, I'd say the anime is around a 5 (mediocre), the anime was heavily over hyped due to its flashly first episode, but from then on, it seriously let down fans on the episodes afterwards. The anime seemed to combine 2 seasons into 1 seasons for some bizarre reason which just caused disjointedness, and a very strange final episode.\\n\\n\r\nBut if you've read this far, I'd like to thank you for reading my review.",

            "content": "I first came across this anime as a recommendation from a friend and I have to say, while the initial idea of the story seemed interesting, I was somewhat hesitant to begin the series due to the addiction factor that came with an uncompleted series. Having completed the 11 episodes in just about a day, I can truthfully say I was completely hooked and craved for more. \r\nIll admit, the pacing of the story initially shocked me. The sense of time passing through this story seems rapid and jumps without warning at the beginning of each episode. However this can be forgiven as the firstfew episodes of every anime is set mainly to develop a stable environment in order for the main story to begin. Although half of the episodes so far are used to develop a \"harem\", none of the characters stick to him like glue and each of their relationships reflect a key problem in this virtual world. \\n\\n\r\nBecause of the rushed story, the character development is equally afflicted. The build up of power and sense of progression that we see in mainstream anime titles such as Naruto and One Piece are skipped, leaving a sense of disappointment. This is partly due to the original author of the light novel series in which this anime is adapted from which skips to stage 74/100 of the game. To be honest, from a more personal view I am quite content at this kind of structure, with the side stories creating the setting, followed up by diving into the romantic aspect of the anime. The characters themselves are likable and they creators try to avoid the obvious stereotypes by adding slight complexities to their characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and musical choice were appropriate to say the least. They did not stand out too much but the artwork style fitted in with the context of the story although some of the animations could have been a lot smoother. The music however was executed perfectly. I could have sworn I had heard a few melodies from the long lost games in the past because they just seemed so generic. This of course is a positive factor and helps make the world of Aincrad more realistic as a game. \\n\\n\r\nThe beauty of this story is not drawn from the characters, story, art or sound but it is the clear presentation of a fantastic virtual world. The onset of nostalgia which many will experience is an alluring factor, but the introduction to this new world and it's system is so clearly explained, one does not have to have experienced previous MMORPG to fully enjoy this series. SAO plays on our dreams and fantasies while at the same time question the obsessive nature of games and whether our actions in games reflect upon real world situations as well. Truly a unique mix of sci-fi and fantasy with an overwhelming romantic theme. \\n\\n\r\n*Just because I am not experienced with reviews nor have I watched too many anime titles I am not afraid to give this anime a 9 which I believe it deserves",

            "content": "I apologize for my ignorance in advance, as I have not read the manga or the light novels or any other related media corresponding to this franchise. This review is solely preliminary and focuses on the first 5 episodes only. \r\nSword Art Online seems to be an anime hyped up by many this season. Its easy to see why, as the setting of a virtual world in which players are trapped and must fight for their lives can easily attract many. Personally, I was excited as well, and as the summer anime season rolled by, I immediately picked it up. I had very high hopesfor this anime, as it was in fact my first \"virtual reality\" anime. I had never watched .hack or any other similar anime so the setting was very fresh to me and i wanted to see how an anime taking place inside an MMO would play out. Now that I've viewed episode 5, it seems fitting to offer my initial thoughts on the series. In my opinion, Sword art online definitely did not disappoint in its portrayal of a virtual world, but is seriously lacking in other aspects such as character development and story. \\n\\n\r\nLets start with the good. Wow. What a fantastic world SAO is. Its portrayal definitely made me jealous of the players. Except for the fact that they were unable to log out and that dying meant death, I definitely wanted to visit SAO. Sword art online portrays its world magnificently. The art is fantastic, the settings are vibrant and colorful, and they all make the viewer feel that they are, in fact, in a virtual MMO. However, what I was even more impressed with were the concepts introduced in SAO. Its easy to see that SAO was inspired by many of today's MMORPGs  but SAO takes it a step further and translates all of these concepts into a VMMORPG. Its very interesting to see how the concept of guilds, parties, and health points are portrayed in a world where the player is the character. One thing i thought was brilliant and hilarious was the concept of \"sleep-pk,\" in which a player duels another player who is asleep, by using the asleep player's finger to accept the request. Overall, sword art online has a magnificent setting and I am looking forward to it expanding over the course of the series.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, I was not a big fan of the storyline or the characters. One main issue I had with the storyline probably came from my unfamiliarity with the franchise. The time gap between episodes 1-5 is erratic and almost none of the episodes had any contiunuty. Generally I'm open to this type of storytelling but the jumping around simply left me confused. Kirito's experience changes drastically in between episodes and it almost seems like he is a different person in each new episode. After wathcing episode 5 it seems that they are finally going through with an \"arc,\" though I would have very much liked for them to continue a coherent story from episode 1. I feel the episodes were more used to show off the concepts and setting of SAO rather than to give insight into Kirito's personality and motives. In fact, I feel that this format of storytelling actually hindered my relationship with Kirito and isolated me from his character. Because of this its hard to keep track of Kirito as so much time passes by in between each episode. In addition, I feel that Kirito is too one dimensional as a character. In almost every episode, he plays the role of a \"white knight\" and helps random girls he runs into. It seems to me that he has no agenda in each episode, and that he is simply there, playing the game and helping people that he runs into. Its hard to see any ulterior motives and it seems to me that Kirito is 100% pure, which I hate because it subtracts from the depth the writers could have added to his character. In episode 5, Asuna returns(finally) and the two embark on an epic journey to.. help investigate a random murder. It seems to me at this point that most of the shows conflicts are caused more by other players rather than by the world itself. I would very much like to see Kirito \"progress\" in the game world and have a goal that he can work towards, rather than come to the aid of anybody who needs his help. Everyone he interacts with seems to be a girl as well(I was starting to think this anime was turning into a harem.)\\n\\n\r\nTo sum it up Sword Art Online is definitely worth watching. The weaknesses I addressed only pertain to the first 5 episodes and it is very possible that the show will pick up. I'm very much expecting it to. The setting is magnificent, and has revived my daydreams of visiting a virtual world. I hope to see a lot more good things from this anime and will post another review whenever I feel like it.",

What started out as a promising series, SAO lets down its audience with weak plot and conflict resolutions.  The periodic and time lapses between episodes cause confusion and misunderstanding.  Without your ability to access primary source (LN), some of the plots are unclear, if not simply misplaced.  What remains of the plot?  Instead of focusing on serious aspects of the story, we are dished with series ofMC's love interest, which serves zero purpose to actual  love interest of MC.  Harem is a word that fits this situation.  The excessive amount of fan service that this story vomits is unjustified and unnecessary.  However, SAO delivers simple and understandable plot objectives, which a little child could understand.  There is a clarity in its objective and I applaud the author of SAO for making that very clear.  \\n\\n\r\n= [ ( Art ) ] = +++ 6 +++\\n\r\nthe art is very justified for this sort of anime.  With harem, loli, and incest, the cutesy style of art is very fitting and well applied.  At the same time however, it does draw away from the believability of the story as a serious material, which the plot, at least at the beginning, promised to be a very mature topic.  It is fortunate that SAO art tries to please teenagers and casual watchers and opted out for harem/romance/damsel in distress plot devices.  \\n\\n\r\n= [ ( Sound ) ] = \"\"\"\" 8 \"\"\"\"\\n\\n\r\nExcellent music--one of saving grace of the series.  It adds excitement to otherwise boring and repetitive action scenes, which seems to overuse charging and 360 degree back and forth.\\n\\n\\n\r\n= [ ( Character ) ] = \"\"\"\"3\"\"\"\"\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development is shallow.  MC is given little time for character development.  Little of what does occur uses convenient plot devices [i.e. death of a friend] to advance its objective, which is extremely cliche and unoriginal.  The time given to achieve this objective was narrowed to just one episode, which devastated the impact of the development as a whole.  As well, other character developments are small or absolutely zero.  If there was a little development, it was completely dependent on their interaction with the MC and it is highly unclear whether character development is visible or understandable from the viewers perspective. \\n\\n\r\n= [ ( Enjoyment ) ] = \"\"\"\"\"6\"\"\"\"\"\\n\\n\r\nSAO is fairly entertaining, due to its cliche plot and high production value.  The forced incest drama is really the highlight of this show, so I highly recommend it.\\n\\n\r\n= [ ( Overall ) ] = \"\"\"\"5\"\"\"\"\\n\\n\r\nI would like to think that 5 is justifiable by my reasoning.  I would've given it 7 or 8 if it weren't for the horrible pacing, weak character development, and overall hype that is given to this show.  IF the show was focused instead of trying to be everything (harem, romance, incest, tragedy, drama, action, seinen, tentacle, sex), SAO could've been an awesome project.  \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Sword Art Online is a terrible, childish, fanfiction level show that has been hyped to death and given mass high scores that it simply does not deserve. But there's probably a good reason for that and that is it's setting. It seems if you want to earn big cash while putting out a dreadful show, choosing to go with a MMO-gaming style theme is the way to go.\r\nThe allure of the show lies in the setting of a virtual reality world where one practically becomes the video game hero you have always dreamed of as a child. It probably isn't an over-generalization to say anyonewho has played a number of video games as a child or has played one MMO dreams of becoming a character in such a reality. The presentation of this ego feeding world is done well enough, with the typical dungeons, towns, and fields that gamers reminisce about to how mechanics and physics work in the world. But this isn't enough to cover up the underlying pack of cliches and poor writing the show is full of.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem with the plot is that it is expanded in to month skips. The show presents an interesting concept where the players of Sword Art Online must beat the game and if their health bar reaches zero, they are killed just like how it would be in real life. Yet, instead of presenting how the 10,000 characters adapt to this horrific news at the beginning of this nightmare, the game proceeds with the main character running off a field with a childish \"I want to be the very best!\" and goes on with a one month skip and a 2000 death number. And with almost each episode, another series of month skips are given without going in to full details about the main character's journey. The month skips are redundant, pass up what would be great opportunities to see the world of SAO, the struggles of characters, and just plain makes the pacing of the show out of rhythm. Flashbacks and lack of details will leave the viewer pondering many questions which can only be answered by doing your own homework: something that a show simply should not force upon viewers.\\n\\n\r\nIf there is one thing this show cannot be forgiven for is the characters themselves, especially Kirito. Many of the characters in the show are one-dimensional, have no real depth, and are simply awfully written. From Klein (The typical bro) to Silica (Moeblob) to Asuna (Aloof tsundere), the characters have nothing interesting to present to the viewer besides their one-defining archetype. \\n\\n\r\nBut the biggest offender to one-dimensional is Kiritio, a character solely created as a self-insert for a kid. From his inability to succeed in real life to becoming the envy of everyone in Sword Art Online, to episodes solely created so girls can fall for how nice he is, to his lack of struggles in the world, he is the epitome of the Gary Stu character. Typically you would expect for a main character to struggle through quests, monsters, bosses, other foul players, etc when given a show about a MMO virtual reality world. Instead Kirito proceeds to breeze through and humiliate any obstacle given. You aren't watching a character become stronger and develop, Kirito starts right off as an unbeatable character who smashes straight through everything. His only real conflict is his belief that he cannot protect his friends and comrades, a laughable messiah complex and the biggest cliche of \"heroes.\" Kirito's character concept is nothing but childish. \\n\\n\r\nWith it's horrendous plot progression and even more horrendous characters, Sword Art Online can only be called mediocre at best. It presents an interesting world but suffers from a lack of exploration and finer details. The production values and soundtrack are nothing impressive and in the end one is simply left with a show that had great ideas, but was poorly executed.",

            "content": "Hype Art Online, or HAO like everyone calls it, is one of the 2 Summer season shows which are worth of a try. Positively thinking it's, luckily, the only Summer series which disappointed me with its mediocrity, over-used cliches and worth-of-nothing characters. \r\nBefore continuing, I need to make something clear about this thing you might be thinking about me; \"You are just mad because HAO got such a high mean score after its first episode.\" This, my friend, is some hilarious shit. Mainly because I replaced an S with an H. Other than that, the sentence is pretty much bullshit. \"People are trying to getit a mean score high as possible because mean score makes the anime better.\" Sounds about as legit. To say make it simple; I don't care about mean scores, I only care about the quality of anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAfter watching the first minute of the series you will already know what the author has in mind - To trap the players inside the game world. When this happends one would expect the players to panic due not getting back to their own world, isn't that right? But nope, that doesn't happen because HAO is one-dimentional shonen which doesn't try to be smart nor realistic by any means at all. I'm wrong? Imagine how you would act in the same situation.\\n\\n\r\nTo make the setting even more cliche and lame you need to make your characters the same. So obviously our MC is the best player in that game and everyone envies him and his skills, he is the best, that's it. This is pretty much the thing what everyone dreamed when they were 7 years-old. You know what shit usually happens when this is done? Lack of character development. The MC also got some other nice tropes to his heart, like badass, which doesn't suite him at all, nor any other bishonen due it appearing mainly overly gay. \\n\\n\r\nBut wait! Some shit happens and there is a player.. even more.. powerful than our MC??!?! Like how? Isn't that the most cliche thing fucking ever? Oh, yeah, almost forgot the nature of this series. Needs to put over-used cliche to lame cliche to make the series deep, all the depth and shit. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCliches aren't all that bad thing if the story is otherwise awesome, the writer has balls to do shit and the character are actually worth of caring about. Unfortunately there is nothing to hold on to in Sword Bishonen Online, which makes it easily to be forgotten, and thus it's not memorable. Substance much? Pretty much the only different between Accel World and SBO is that HAO is dead-boring already from the very beginning while AW had actually some potentiality in the beginning. Also, pretty sure HBO will broadcast this at some point.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe pace of the series is something I'd call weird. Seems like not much is happening, yet the whole thing is extremely rushed. When I say it's rushed, I do not mean that the pacing is super fast. From recent anime e.g. Sakamichi no Apollon is really fast paced but it's not rushed due talented direction and quality execution. That's something HAO just lacks. Also, the director is a noname who has e.g. been part of the team who wrote Guilty Crown's storyboard, so, there you go. Just saying, though. \\n\\n\\n\r\nProduction values really aren't notable. The art isn't bad but nothing special either, but I do agree it being fitting to the series. I personally dislike the character desing for the reason that it reminds me of personality lacking fanservice robots from Guilty Crown, but maybe that's just me. Animation is okay, but nothing worth of praising. It's not like the producers are known from their action scenes or anything anyway. Voice acting is decent enough. Theme songs come from LiSA, and she is amazing. Best thing in the series if you ask me, but I'm music faggot anyway. \\n\\n\\n\r\nI already heard complains about how wrong I am because HAO is actually one of the best from this Summer season. But no, don't misunderstand me. This season is absolutely terrible. I'm not saying this show is utter trash when comparing to other this season shows, I'm saying HAO is another cliche and very much an average series. It might be really enjoyable to watch, but is it actually good and easy to find it entertaining? No, I don't think so.",

            "content": "Okay, so this is my first review. Here it goes.\r\n So, when I first watched this I was like, \"Cool! This looks so great! The style is great, the plot can lead to many different directions and the OST is EPIC! I mean, people getting trapped in a video game and have to defeat 100 bosses? I look forward to lots of action!\"\r\n FALSE.\r\n The first 3 episodes were good, but then it turned into some stupid romance with no character development, what-so-ever! So, now, I will rate the anime.\r\nStory-1\r\n I would give it a 4 because of the whole, defeat the bosses to escpaedeath thing, but that was really only like, 3 episodes in the entire thing, infact,\\n\\n\r\n*SPOILER* they move onto a different vide ogame after. *SPOILEROVER* \\n\\n\r\nThey could have had  such a great story coming from the whole \"main\" plot. Like each arc could have been 1 boss/floor. But the there were time skips, that just made the story even worse because Kirito, the main character, goes from some okay guy, to the most powerful guy out there! HOW? Then, as soon as he \\n\r\n*SPOILER* asked asuna to marry him*SPOILEROPVER*\\n\\n\r\n I was like, I'm done with this! It tricked me, an action lover, into thinking it was an action anime, but then it turned into a stupid romance with a pathetic action scene here and there. There were also a lot of plot holes. and they were BIG plot holes. I don't want to give anything away,though.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8\\n\r\nThe art was actually really good, one of the things that drew me into the anime at first. The outfits, backrounds, colour, and such, all wonderful.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10\\n\r\n I LOVE the music. Yuki Kajura does it again! The sound track is so beautiful, I still listen to it. The best part of this anime was the sound track:) EPICNESS! It's too bad the anime wasn't as great as the OST.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 2\\n\r\nThe only good character was kirito, but even he wasn't 3 dimensional. He was perfect. Too perfect. Everyone else, I hated, especially asuna, she doesn't even deserve a capital at the beginning of her name. Kirito was WAY to good for her and all she was good for was cooking. Also, they didn't even focus on any other character besides Kirito and asuna. They didn't even focus on the bad guy. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 3\\n\r\n Did I enjoy this? The first 3 episodes? yes. The rest? NO! It was always Kirito going around making girls fall for him and then dumping them without really meaning to. It wasn't even significant to the plot. I didn't even finish the anime. It was too sad. It went all down hill at episode 3. All. Down. Hill.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 2\\n\r\n If I find the average, this anime would get a 5. (4.8, but I rounded it) I gave it a 2 because this anime almost made me cry. In a bad way. It was that dumb. It had SOOOOOO much potential, but the writers killed it. I also heard that the second half wasn't as good as good as the first and if the first half got a 2 from me, I wasn't wasting my bandwith.banwith. what ever it is called. I mean, the best part about the first arc was that if they died in the game the died in real life. That doesn't happen in the second arc. How do I know? I watched the last episode or something.\\n\\n\r\n*SPOILER ALERT* which makes no sense since they both die at the end of the arc and somehow live. Does that mean they could have died and just left the game peacfully all along? plot hole! *SPOILEROVER*\\n\\n\r\nAnywho, this was a pretty sad anime, and when i say sad, I mean SAD. Some people actually like it though, so if you like anime with failed plots, give it a try:)\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "WARNING: Spoilers ahead; read at your own risk. (Or if you don't really care, then read away, I guess...)\r\nWell, where shall I begin with this... I'll just say right now that this series (one which I had really high hopes for) ended up becoming absolutely horrid by the second half; each episode getting progressively worse than the last. But, in any case, let's discuss this shall we?\r\nThe story: It's basically just your typical MMO-genre type of series (think .Hack but with actual fighting as opposed to the characters just standing around and talking episode after episode). The first half of the series takes place inthe world of Sword Art Online (hence the title) where everyone including the main character, Kirito, becomes trapped and in order to free themselves from their virtual imprisonment, they must clear all of the floors within the world's dungeon.(There's the whole \"if you die in this world you'll die in real life\" thing, but again, this is really nothing new.) In the second half, Kirito enters another MMO called ALfheim Online where he must now rescue his waifu, Asuna (a girl he met in the first game that ended up being trapped in the virtual world after everyone else in SAO had been freed) who now lies waiting for him at the top of the World Tree, a colossal tree in the centre of this new world. I won't go into too much detail, but the series really goes downhill from this point on. I'll just say that there were a few bad writing choices and leave it at that. *Cough.* A horrible villain, a tentacle scene, and incest (Oh my!). *Cough.*\\n\\n\r\nThe Art: Definitely one of the high points of this series (this being one of the only ones). As an artist myself, I can say the characters were drawn fairly well, but I can't help but say that I've seen this art style somewhere before... Oh well, moving on! Though aside from the characters, I must say that the world(s) look absolutely gorgeous and there seems to be quite a few well used colour schemes in certain scenes. Bottom line: It's pretty and colourful. NEXT!\\n\\n\r\nThe Sound: The soundtrack was both very intense as well as very peaceful and relaxing when it needed to be during certain scenes. Although, if I had to make one nitpick about it then I'd say that a lot of the tracks sound fairly similar to one another if not almost the same track played differently. (Though I can't say that for certain, it did sound like that to me.)\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters: This part was kind of like a roller coaster to me; at one point I'd want to murder them for all of the horrible choices they made, but then they kind of grew on me as the series progressed. However, during the second part when a certain character appeared, I just couldn't take this series seriously (especially near the end where he was literally licking off the heroine's tears and trying to rape her whilst the protagonist could only sit and watch). Just... No... A tip for any writers out there: DON'T MAKE YOUR CHARACTERS ACT LIKE BLOODY CARTOONS! If you want to write a character well, then make them a bit more realistic and even relatable. Even a villain can be a relatable character if written correctly (trust me, I've seen it).\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it wasn't a completely AMAZING series like I was hoping for, but I did get a fair amount of enjoyment from it (not so much the second half, but beggars can't be choosers). If you want to watch it for the sake of wanting to watch something of this genre, then just watch up to episode fourteen and drop it immediately (trust me, the other half is not worth sticking around for). If you're a writer looking for what NOT to do, then I'd recommend watching it all the way through. What are you doing still reading this? Go watch it and see for yourself whether it's good or not. Go on... Shoo...",

            "content": "Here it is! My first review here on the wonderful website on MAL and what better way to kick start my reviews then with one of the most controversial and possibly overrated anime of all time. Of course I'm writing about SAO. \r\nThe story in SAO at first glance seems very interesting and almost desirable. A video game is released in the year 2022 and has each gamer step foot in a virtual VRMMORPG( Virtual Reality Massive Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game) This seems like an excellent setting for an anime and was something that got me excited for this anime. However what SAO does withthis setting simply is the definition of wasted potential. Throughout all of SAO's main story arc it keeps drifting away farther from its core story line. So what is exactly the main story line in SAO? well, you have Kirito our main protagonist in SAO who decides to play this game and try and beat it. Thousands of people enter this virtual gaming world in hopes they can also beat it just like Kirito wants to. However they soon find out that they are trapped inside the game until they beat the final boss. Also if you die in SAO, you die in real life. The first 4 episodes or so really suck you into the world of SAO  but after you meet Kirito's love interest AKA Asuna, the story keeps tumbling down a spiral of never ending boredom and annoying episodes. I really gave up on SAO's story line after the first half of the season where they set SAO in a new MMO. The story never focuses enough on beating the game and more or less focuses on the love between Kirito and Asuna. This is where SAO becomes a real drag and honestly a pain to watch.it becomes Predictable and extremely cliche. Not to mention the story isn't paced what so ever and jumps all over the place.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in SAO is one of the things it has going for it. Beautiful in almost every scene especially the action parts of the anime, this show really knows how to show off a cool action scene. The animation is crisp and clean and every major characters' face is detailed and distinctive. This is something I really loved about SAO even if it's all just eye candy.\\n\\n\r\nAnother part of SAO's saving graces is the sound and music. The music in each scene is fits very well and is enjoyable to the ear, dare I say even the sad moments felt even more sad due to the music. which is what music should do in every anime. In terms of dub or sub, I would say sub however the dubbed version isn't the worst and is for sure watchable. It may all come down to preference in the long run.\\n\\n\r\nI'm just gonna come out and say SAO has some of the worst characters out there and the most wasted. The two main reasons why SAO's characters are so bad is because 1. They have ZERO and I mean zero development in their personalities. For example Kirito is overpowered from the first episode to the last. Nothing seems like a challenge for Kirito or an obstacle.This makes SAO very boring to watch and soo predictable. My second reason why the characters suck so much in SAO is that there are just too many! You have a harem type thingy going on mid way through the first half of the season where Kirito meets girls who all have a some what of a love interest in him. I don't have a problem with this if only the characters were actually interesting!       \\n\r\nSAO introduces one character and then seems to throw it out like yesterdays trash! It's frustrating when you have multiple characters introduced in an anime yet only two are fully fledged out. In terms of how Asuna's character is, all I can say is that she's the typical Tsundere love interest until they some how fall in love in a video game. I won't even go into detail on Yui's character as I believe she's the most worthless. Oh and also Kirito has a \"Sister\" or cousin who falls in love with him and wants to be with him. Somehow or someway an anime revolved around beating a virtual MMO managed to include an incest story line in the mix. Great job SAO.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, did I enjoy SAO? Sort of, I say this lightly as anyone is even remotely intelligent in terms of anime would know this is an overrated anime full of eye candy and cool effects. Something excites new comers to anime. SAO would've a great anime had it done all the things correctly. I enjoyed the action scenes and awesome music yet dreaded the two main characters who I'm supposed to love and cheer for. In short Sword Art Online was a Colossal disappointment.       \\n\\n",

            "content": "Sword Art Online \u2013 it\u2019s the anime where you either hate it or love it. On paper, it seems like a very good idea: ten thousand people are trapped in a virtual world with no way out other than completing all one hundred floors of the world which get increasingly difficult. Gamers everywhere would love this concept and as a gamer, I won\u2019t lie when I say that Sword Art Online intrigued me. The first episode was very promising \u2013 beautiful art with some of the most gorgeous scenery, a nice tutorial for not only a newcomer to the game, but the audience as welland a main character that seemed very likable. The future looked bright for the series and I anticipated more.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, in one fell swoop, the delight of the first episode vanished as it went on. And on.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s not to say that the entire series should be exactly like the first episode, it shouldn\u2019t. The problem is that everything that made the first episode so great is absent from the rest of the series. The breathtaking environments and even the likability of the main character seem to crash and burn as soon as the second episode hits. People hating on the beta-testers, labelling them as \u201cbeaters\u201d when they\u2019re clearly the people you would want helping you the most. It\u2019s very strange that as it goes on, you\u2019re introduced to characters that you\u2019ll be seeing more of but only if they haven\u2019t appeared for six episodes. Those characters in particular are the most interesting ones.\\n\\n\r\nThe story follows Kirito, one of those aforementioned beta-testers that already knows the ropes and happenings of Sword Art Online. He starts off as a guide to another character in the very first episode, being very energetic and helpful towards him. The problem is, due to his real life shut-in tendencies, Kirito likes to be by himself, therefore being a solo player. When it\u2019s discovered that no one can log out of the game, it\u2019s revealed that the ten thousand people in the game can\u2019t escape and their minds are trapped in the game. If they die in the game, they\u2019re dead in real life. If someone takes off the headgear needed to play the game, it\u2019ll fry their brain and kill the player. It is said that whoever can complete all one hundred floors of the game can escape and free everyone. With that, Kirito goes on his merry journey to save everyone, though his initial intent is to save himself.\\n\\n\r\nThe premise is good, but the execution is absolutely poor beyond belief. As the series goes on, the overall life-or-death theme goes out the window for the main character, since he becomes far stronger than anyone else in the game. As the series goes on, there are a lot of time-gaps. It can be several months before something important to the plot actually happens and there isn\u2019t much of a care regarding who has died besides those who the main character knows. Early on in the series, Kirito meets a small guild who doesn\u2019t know his true level or his strength. Within the guild, there\u2019s a girl who believes she\u2019s not very strong and takes a liking to Kirito after they have a talk. Within the same episode, she dies. This gives the illusion that you\u2019re supposed to care about that character, wherein she\u2019s given no time to develop and the only connection she has to us is a few lines she spoke to the main character which is the loosest form of character development. There is little to no character development throughout the whole story.\\n\\n\r\nThe character that seemed interesting before the plot downgraded her was Asuna, the love-interest. She was introduced in the same episode the series began to show its \u201cweak-points\u201d if you will. She started off as a very strong female character, someone who many people could aspire too. She becomes basically second-in-command to the biggest guild in the entire game and is shown as very dominate, willing and caring. As the series goes on, the caring aspect goes way out of proportion as it becomes the only thing she can do: care. She becomes Kirito\u2019s emotional anchor; his soulmate \u2013 no longer a badass, independent, strong woman character. The fact that there were other characters that were her eventually downgraded version before the plot made her less interesting than a plank of burnt wood and she was tossed into that crowd is severely disappointing for her character and the audience alike.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style and the music seem to be the only things that the series has going for it. The designs of the characters, clothing, weaponry, monsters, and locations \u2013 they all look good and appealing to the eye, with fight scenes looking magnificent. The music accompanying those scenes and the series as a whole isn\u2019t bad in itself. It\u2019s very grand and epic, music fitting for an actual video game. While these are the only good aspects of the series, it\u2019s bad when you need something else to be more appealing than the story or characters. The fight scenes look great, yes, but it\u2019s not gratifying enough to acknowledge that your lacklustre characters and plot are enough to keep an audience: you need flashing fighting and ecchi scenarios to be more intriguing than anything else.\\n\\n\r\nSword Art Online really shows just how emotionally draining it can be during the final episodes. During the fight against the Big Bad, the creator of the game, Kirito becomes impaled with his sword and all hope is seemingly lost. At this moment, it seems that we would be getting a bittersweet ending and that the series would\u2019ve ended on something we wouldn\u2019t call a \u201chigh note\u201d but to show you can\u2019t fight your battles alone- Or, you could just break the game and not die. This is when the series knows it\u2019s being ridiculous, by having the main character break the rules of a perfectly designed game. Does it make any sense? No. Is the main character awesome for accidently finding an exploit that should exist in the first place? No. This was the moment a fanfiction writer came into the office, squealed that the main character was about to die and wrote in nonsense. It doesn\u2019t make for a good save and it\u2019s randomness out of nowhere is insanely bad.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and: it\u2019s revealed that the Big Bad had no motive at all after losing. Fuck. You.\\n\\n\r\nAfter all that, everyone is freed from Sword Art Online and the two lovebirds can live happily ever- there are still eleven episodes left!? Yes, that\u2019s correct: there is a second season in which Kirito goes into another game that was launched during the time Sword Art Online in order to save Asuna because her mind was transferred into the other game after Kirito saves everyone due to the fact that the creator will marry her while she\u2019s in her comatose state as he wants her family\u2019s riches and- did this just become a lot more ridiculous? It\u2019s odd when the audience thinks that this new plot is strange and may as well not exist.\\n\\n\r\nThe second season doesn\u2019t introduce any other worthwhile characters besides Kirito\u2019s cousin, who is in love with him because the harem set-up from the first season won\u2019t die out. It\u2019s a shame that the second season tries to bring back an aspect that wasn\u2019t interesting or even necessary in the first place. Unlike Asuna or his cousin, there was no real development for the other female characters to fall in love with him. Even so, there wasn\u2019t really any development for Asuna or his cousin to fall in love with him either. The romantic aspect of this anime is without a doubt underdeveloped and probably shouldn\u2019t have been one of the themes.  All of this is here to give us a reason to care for badly written, clich\u00e9d and unable-to-relate-to characters that could\u2019ve been replaced with rubber gloves filled with acid.\\n\r\nAsuna\u2019s a damsel-in-distress? They just won\u2019t let her be the only good main character, will they?\\n\\n\r\nThe second season, shockingly, is a lot better than the first season. The villain actually has a clear motive right from the beginning unlike the previous villain, the relationship between Kirito and his cousin is more elaborate and understandable in contrast to Kirito and anyone else in whole series and the climax isn\u2019t botched up with breaking the rules for no reason. Unlike the climax happening in the game, like in the first season, it happens in real life and it\u2019s very dramatic, something that this series didn\u2019t pull off that well until the final episode.  With that in mind, it can be ridiculous as well and strangely dark. The villain would qualify as a rapist, groping and liking Asuna\u2019s breasts. There are slug monsters which, if given more screen time, would\u2019ve given us some tentacle hentai that would be most unwanted and the fact that his cousin doesn\u2019t know who Kirito is in the game despite the voice and very similar appearance until he mentions Asuna\u2019s name.\\n\\n\r\nThis could\u2019ve been a lot better, it really could\u2019ve but it\u2019s just so bad that it\u2019s a wonder why people thought this was good in the first place. A friend of mine said it was good; he was shocked when I said I thought it was bad. For what it\u2019s worth, Sword Art Online will only appeal to those who want action and attractive women that will be used in countless H-Manga. Sword Art Online is bad, though it doesn\u2019t go into the territory of being absolutely terrible. It\u2019s start was great \u2013 why did it have to get worse as it went on. Overall, Sword Art Online is a bad anime with bad characters and terrible writing. Avoid it for your own benefit.",

            "content": "When I first started watching it, the show was about people stuck in a game world, with the only way being out is to defeat the final boss. Now this can lead to many interesting things, like how the players react to this, to each other, and so on. And the show does in fact reveal some of these things to us. We can see people right off the bat becoming scared and sad that if they die in the game, they die in real life.\r\nSo there is nothing wrong with the setting of the story. Except for one little thing, and that is ittries to be too much like the real world. The show has MANY filler scenes where characters yell out the same generic comment about how delicious digital food is. The filler takes up a good two-five minutes per episode. It is in EVERY episode so far. \\n\\n\r\nBefore I comment on another part on how it tries to be like real life, I must first explain the romance in this story. The boy named Kirito is a chick magnet. He attracts every female that comes into contact with him. So you would expect this to be some kind of harem. But it's not! He does pick a girl to romance, and it seems all the other girls acknowledge this. I am going to assume the rest of the show will display what a couple does.\\n\\n\r\nOk now back to how it tries to be like real life. Like with other MMOs, you can get married. A normal person would know it's not a big deal since it's just a game. But it's treated like a big deal in this virtual world. This is not a problem, it's what a married couple can create that is a problem. The third member of their family isn't really their kid, but they treat her like she's the most important daughter in the world! Within a day of being with her! \\n\\n\r\nThe story itself isn't bad at all, it is just the characters that make it bad. \\n\\n\r\nThe main character, Kirito, is nearly perfect. He grinds, grinds, and grinds to reach very high level and stats. He always has a solution to everything. Every girl he talks to falls for him. To raise the coolness factor with this guy, he receives a new skill (have to avoid spoilers for the poor souls that will still watch this crap). I am trying to think of his flaws right now...and maybe he has problems socializing? Nope, he can get along with anyone, and those he can't get along are just plainly evil or it's not kirito's problem at all.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't think it would be possible for another character to be more perfect than him. A show having two mary stus? lol impossible.\\n\\n\r\nOh wait, his lover is one too. Except she's even better! And is the root of the food filler scenes. Her only flaw is that she can't live without him. Aka another female character that the writer decides needs a man in her life so she can function properly.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly I was rooting for every bad character there was in the show, even though I knew kirito would dispose of him like yesterday's trash. The side characters are a lot more interesting than these two that's for sure.\\n\\n\r\nOk now that I'm done with characters and story, I'll move on to the next important aspect of the show, the art. If you can stomach boring perfect characters, long food filler scenes that amount to nothing, and can block out other characters mentioning how strong/cool/beautiful/nice/etc the two main characters are, I am sure you'll enjoy the art. Honestly this is one of the hardest things for an anime studio to mess up on, and that's drawing. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough I do have one issue with the art, just one. The swords glow. It glows every time the character does an attack. And it looks really lame. But other then that, the art isn't bad.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I couldn't enjoy the show. I stopped at 12 to save myself from the pain of watching it. I think I'll watch episode 24/25 just to see why the game creator did all this for. If you turn off your brain, I am sure you can enjoy this show too with it's delicious food, and light sabers.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Started this because I was a hardcore gamer once. I thought this would be funny because I heard it follows the main character, Kirito, throughout the completion of Sword Art Online, which happened to be a mmorpg unlike otehr shows about card games and such that never interested me and I always thought were shitboring. \r\nI think this could have been a good show, a very very entertaining one. BUT only for the people that actually play mmorpgs. Why ? Because there are certain \"inside\" things that \"normal ppl\" wouldn't really understand or better say perceive as being utterly hilarious. \r\nFor example, if you area gamer like me, you will have fun realizing that the producers MUST DEFINITELY be hardcore players as well, otherwise i doubt it would have been possible for them to reproduce the gaming clishees so closely. You will definitely find yourself thinking \"omg i was also a solo player!\" \"omg this happened to me too when i joined a guild\" \"rofl i also died when tried to open a treasure chest!\" and similar stuff. \\n\\n\r\nI suppose this show could have turned great for the likes of me IF it only followed the player's experience closely for the entire show. It could have been funny because, you know, when spending hours and days and maybe years playing a game we, the gamers, basically do what SAO's plot is about: we shut ourselves in away from the outside world. Althought we aren't really in a coma like in this show, we live in our virtual pointless space for quite a long time. \\n\\n\r\nThis show could have been intelligent if it somehow managed to mock the gaming experience rather than taking it seriously and thus disappointing, at least me. As an anime show, this is, without a doubt, absolutely terrible. It's basically a harem with annoying girls who pop up every damn episode with their \"noob\" stories, somehow Kirito has to save them (or not if they are out of luck). It's so repetitive that after watching for so long, waiting for the story to actually move on, you finally realize that you are watching an endless arc of fillers. \\n\\n\r\nWhy is this ranked 53?! How can this be ? I agree, the show might get back on track later on, but since for weeks we are just watching fillers, the boring kind of fillers that have no point whatsoever, I had lost hope that it will turn to be the amazing show that I expected it to be after watching first episode. Maybe the high rates were based on people's expectations also, not on actual values of the fillers.\\n\\n\r\nWill continue watching just because I still have hope. But for now this is just a very very big disappointment.",

            "content": "Ok so I really wanted to like this anime.  I love the idea of being trapped in an mmo, maybe because I played WoW for a few years.  Unfortunately the writing is god awful.  The story is practically non existant, there's pretty much nothing about advancing in the world and trying to escape.  Each episode seems pretty unrelated and is predictable.  You also literally miss the first 50 or so floors, I understand nobody wants to watch Kirito grind his way up but something here would have been nice.  Whats even worse though is the characters.  Each oneof them is pretty cliche and boring with virtually no interesting dialogue.  Kirito for instance is a super powerful and pure  character who looks like he will always do the \"right\" thing.  That looks like there is all there is to his character like we havent seen that in a billion other animes right?  Oh and it is looking like he's gonna have some sort of harem, great as if the show couldn't get anymore superficial.  The art looks really nice, although the fighting scenes aren't interesting whatsoever.  I'll probably give this anime a few more episodes but it's becoming increasingly tedious to watch.",

            "content": "(May have minor spoilers, read at your own risk) People are trapped in an online game and if you die in the game, you die in real life.  Sounds great doesn't it?  Well I am afraid that this is actually a very disappointing series (so far).\r\nNote: This is my first review so I'm gonna try really hard to make it not boring.\r\nStory-2: So people are playing an MMO in which they need to beat the top floor of the game in order to beat it, sounds normal right?  So they go floor by floor beating up boss after boss right?  Wellno, the first episode they explain more or less how the game works and in the second episode they fight their first boss (its not a spoiler if its completely obvious right?) and theeeeeeeeeeeeeeen they skip around 10 floors.  Then this episode and a few more revolve more around other characters and how they act being in this world.  So at this point I am guessing the story is more about the characters than them beating the game.  This usually isn't a problem for me, although if you want to refer to my opinion on the characters, go to \"Characters:\"\\n\r\ntl;dr - Not as advertised \\n\\n\r\nArt-8: It looks pretty.  What else can I say?  The animation is done pretty well.   I'm not that big on graphics or anything so that's all I will say.\\n\\n\r\nSound-7:  It doesn't make my ears bleed but I don't particularly love the music in this anime.  The voice acting is actually good.  Nothing much else to say about this.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-1:  Cliche as hell.  Main character is obviously the strongest and most well known person in the game, all the pretty girls want him, bad guys are bad for the most generic reasons, and all the characters the show revolves around are boring and forever forgotten (most of them are).\\n\r\ntl;dr - They suck\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-4:  It's bad, but its at least a decent time-passer.  Its funny to see how terrible it is.  Reminds me of when I watched Mars of Destruction\\n\\n\r\nOverall-4:  So its an anime about the characters, but the characters suck.  Has a few action scenes (not really) that are ok but they don't happen all that often (weird considering that this is an MMO).  I don't understand why everybody likes this.  It had potential, but it didn't turn out all that great.  Its mediocre at best.  I will continue watching it and update this as unnecessary, but I say you should waste your time doing something else.\\n\r\ntl;dr - Don't watch this, go and do anything else.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for taking the time to read this.  Have a great day!",

            "content": "Due to the popularity of Sword Art Online, I decided to give it a chance despite the fact that I have heard divided opinions in regards to the series. In this case, the best way to know is to watch it. Unfortunately, I had to be stubborn to watch through all the episodes. I'll make an attempt to review different points about SAO which will explain why I do not feel that the series deserves as much positive credit as it receives.\r\nI'll begin with the story. At the beginning I became quite positive in regards to SAO as the first couple of episodes had adecent beginning which caught my interest. It passed as a start for the series and I was interested to see where this was head. Sadly, it did not last for more than two episodes. Suddenly the pace became quite ridiculous, there were major plot holes throughout the episodes and some seemed more like fillers than actual story and the quality simply dropped, with an abrupt ending of the first Arc that was not at all satisfactory. In the second Arc, it took a turn for the worse. When I thought that SAO could not become worse, the second Arc appeared with an even worse story, progression and even added fan service which was not at all tasteful. It's a shame, but the quality of the story simply became poor.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the story was quite the disappointment, the art was not. It was more than decent, even good and I found some enjoyment through that. It isn't perfect, but was quite suitable for what SAO attempted to be. \\n\\n\r\nOnce again, a positive side to SAO. I cannot say that I have any complaints about the sound, not the sound effects nor the voice actors. It may be the case that the sound was the best part of SAO. I cannot consider the sound effects to be too unique, the voice actors to be outstanding nor the OST to be a masterpiece, but I enjoyed it nonetheless, one of the most positive sides to the series.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, there is another part of SAO that I cannot adress other than being negative about it. I am now talking about the characters. I'll adress the main characters, and a general review of supporting characters and villains:\\n\\n\r\n- Kirigaya, Kazuto. Sometimes you can meet unique, interesting characters that really catches your interest which leads to you wanting to see where this character's story leads. With Kirigaya Kazuto, or Kirito, this is not the case. Quite the opposite, Kirito is a generic hero without being unique even the slightest. In fact, there is nothing unique about him. He is the main protagonist, the hero, the prodigy, the ladies man, every generic aspect you can get in a character, Kirito has it.\\n\\n\r\n- Yuuki, Asuna. Tsundere. You may as well forget about the character names and simply give them names by their character progression. Asuna is without a doubt the generic tsundere of SAO. She is without character and while her voice actor does a good enough job, that does not help this lost cause. You all know what happens between the generic hero and the generic tsundere.\\n\\n\r\n- Yui. I suppose the point is that we are to be charmed by this young girl. Personally, that was not the case for me. I guess she can be called the generic moe out of the main characters. It is likely the best description to serve her.\\n\\n\r\n- Supporting characters. I really want to say that the supporting characters of SAO are redeemable, but they are not. Once again, the supporting characters are generic and without qualities that deem them unique or anything special in particular. Generic males from short, skinny and geeky to tall and buff, as generic as can be and the females are no different from characters that appear strong but are not, to characters who are also moe.\\n\\n\r\n- Villains. In SAO, as a setting inside a game, there are boss fights which then excludes the opportunity to introduce a large amount of villains. This should be a positive thing, so that those who are the actual villains can become well-developed. This is not the case. Just like the other characters, the villains are also poor and generic, and the main antagonists have nothing unique about them.\\n\\n\r\nAt best, the enjoyment I got out from SAO was decent but for the most part that was not the case. Despite that the setting is in a game, it did not even feel like a game at all. While there were a few points in the first Arc that made it slightly redeemable, the second Arc ruined most of that to the point I rolled my eyes due to the pace, the plotholes, the characters or even the fact that plenty of scenes became predictable. Overall, Sword Art Online does not deserve all the positive credit it has received, instead appearing to me as a poor and wasted attempt at a concept that could have been a lot more interesting. It's a shame.",

            "content": "Sword Art Online... You know, at one point, I was actually really excited about watching this show to the point that it was THE show I was looking forward to that season and all the other shows were just fodder, but as the show went on, and its problems became more and more apparent, I grew a burning hatred for everything about it that it began to define me at one point. Word of advice: Just because something is popular does NOT mean it's good (Just look at Justin Bieber, Twilight, and Call of Duty), as you will learn the hard way with this.\r\nFirst ofall, let me start with that it's about. Sword Art Online is separated into two story arcs. Episodes 1 through 14 is the Aincrad arc. The story is set in the year 2022, the latest VR technology known as NerveGear was released alongside the titular MMORPG. The main character, 14-year old Kazuto Kirigaya (also known as Kirito) is one of the game's 10,000 owners after having beta-tested the game prior. What kind of company produces only 10,000 copies of a game? That's not good business, if you ask me. Anyway, upon starting the game, Kirito learns that there's no logout function. This wasn't a design flaw, but intentionally done by the creator, Akihiko Kayaba. He also explains that the players will die for real if they try to have their NerveGears removed or shut down, or if they die in the game. The only way to escape is by completing the game.\\n\\n\r\nWhat could've been an enjoyable VR experience becomes nothing but a struggle of life and death. Meanwhile, what could've been an actually good show became a godawful show. What's wrong with this show, you ask? Plenty of reasons.\\n\\n\r\nLet's talk about the characters, mainly the protagonists: For starters, these are not characters. These are bland, unoriginal, one-dimensional cardboard cutouts.\\n\\n\r\nKazuto/Kirito is basically your standard Gary Stu wish fullfillment protagonist. He has the highest stats in the game, gets all the best skills and items, always wears black clothing to show that he's this dark and emo anti-hero, bends the rules to his advantage to win every battle, and is desired by almost every single female. In other words, being this guy is basically every single socially awkward hardcore gamer's wet dream. He's the main character so everyone that isn't him matters none. Nobody wants to watch an overpowered self-insert bending the rules of the game to his liking. In any real MMO, no single player would see anything Kirito does an impressive, nor will anyone idolize him for doing what is essentially cheating. They would see him as a pathetic loser who has no real skill of his own. And that's what Kirito is: a loser. No matter what anyone tries to say, he's not smart, complex, or badass, let alone a character. He's a walking example of the writinf's complete and utter laziness. \\n\\n\r\nAsuna Yuuki is probably the worst of the two. She's so stupid, she ends up making Bella Swan from Twilight seem not as stupid in comparison. At first, she seems fine, but as the series progresses and she become a full-time main character, she comes off as your typical tsundere and contributes absolutely nothing at all other than make Kirito do stuff for her and drag him into being a even worse character than usual. Oh and guess what? She's supposedly one of the top players in SAO, but all of her skill points is maxed out only to her cooking stat. That's right, no focusing on any particular stats that would be helpful to progress through the game like strength, vitality, defense, agility, or what have you. The only worthwhile use Asuna has is in the kitchen. To this day, I still laugh at the fact people actually refer to Asuna as a strong female character. In fact, anyone who thinks Asuna is \"a strong female character\" makes me assume that they actually don't know what that even means. I've seen a good amount of actual strong female characters to know full well that Asuna is most definitely not one.\\n\\n\r\nAbout a fifth into the series run, the story becomes less about surviving in a game of life and death and more about giving Kirito a harem. Like I mentioned before, it's a given rule for any female that cross paths with Kirito to instantly fall for him. Why the chick falls for him is never explained. It sums down to \"I love Kirito-kun because\" and that's it. No reason at all. And when you put Kirito and Asuna together, then it gets really bad. It's bad enough these two are bland characters. But when their romance (For lack of a more suitable word) starts, it's just as bland. They pretty much do nothing that implies romance between the two: She hangs out with him for awhile, shares sandwiches with him, whacks him whenever he accidentally gropes her. An episode or two later, they're in love and they're married. Uh, what? There's no buildup to it that it comes out of nowhere, and what's worse is that romance completely overshadows everything. I mean, THAT is the plot that Sword Art Online focuses around: Not about 10,000 people fighting for their lives in a virtual world, it's about teenage romance that's so undeveloped that it makes you wonder if the writers looked at Atatck of the Clones for inspiration. They selfishly waste two and a half episodes on their honeymoon while everyone else is off progressing through the game. Our protagonists, everyone. Who cares about escaping the game? The script is pretty much godawful, the worst offender being episode 13, where Asuna spews out stuff about how meeting Kirito changed her life and how she believes meeting him was the very reason she put the NerveGear on. It's completely unbelievable and comes off as nothing but BS.\\n\\n\r\nLater on, they adopt this AI girl as their daughter. Her name is Yui and she's arguably competing with Asuna as the worst female. She has absolutely no character and serves no purpose other than desperately try too hard to act cute and be the moeblob that panders to whatever otaku audience. In fact, her introductory episodes was the point where the series quality declined. Also, nothing agains her voice actors. I'm sure they do a good jo bportraying the character but mother of God, Yui sounds horrible. It's like that extremely high-pitched mousey moeblob voice, only alot more grating. She's easily unbearable when she's talking. Like, please stop talking.\\n\\n\r\nNow Akihiko Kayaba, the evil mastermind that is responsible for the deaths of around a third of the game's population: When Kirito finally confronts him and asks what was his motivation for doing this, his answer sums up to \"I forgot.\" He even states that he probably had none at all. In the end. SAO's purpose is completely negated and makes you feel like so much time was wasted and so many people lost their lives for absolutely nothing. If that wasn't the most trollish slap-in-the-face since the last few episodes of Blood-C, I don't know what is.\\n\\n\r\nThere are only a few characters I like, but they are barely seen at all, let alone given any character development because the story follows only Kirito and considers no one else important. Klein (The guy with the red headband) is the first friend Kirito makes once he enters SAO. You would expect him to be Kirito's wingman or something of the sort, but he's only seen for 5, maybe 6 episodes total. Silica (the loli with the dragon) is one of the more popular characters and she only has a screentime total of one episode and a few cameos here and there. In fact, her only notable scene is walking into the same room with Kirito in her undies. Why even bother introducing these characters if you're not ever going to develop them? Matter of fact, I don't even know why Silica is popular. Because she's a loli. That's basically her only appeal. Same goes for Lisbeth, a blacksmith player, who's, uh... Yeah, what's her appeal? None that I can think of. There's no point in liking any of these females at all. They offer nothing to anything. There's nothing to their character other than she's in love with Kirito-kun. And I think at some point, the author even mentioned that it was hard for him to write a female that doesn't fall for Kirito.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot: I've already described the plot. That's it. The rest of the show doesn't ever expand on that premise save for a few minuscule mentions of how many players are still alive. Aside from that, the premise is mostly ignored to the point that it's nonexistant. In fact, through the course of the series, we see the characters with their items and equipment changed only in between episodes. You'd think that a show based in an MMORPG would be focused around character customization, equipment upgrading, skill sets, etc., but it's never elaborated upon. For example, Kirito somehow pulls a dual-wielding skill out of nowhere. How and when he acquired it is never elaborated. He even says it randomly appeared out of nowhere in his skill list. In fact, that's a constant problem: We're only told about this number of played died, but it's never shown. Like the writers just wants us to take their word for it.\\n\\n\r\nObviously, when we're dealing with a show where anyone can die so you'd expect there'd be some suspense and drama. Nope. Everytime someone dies, the drama falls flat because we haven't known the character long enough to care enough for him or her. A half of an episode isn't enough to for me to know one character! The only \"tragic\" death, according to this series, is Yui's. When she \"dies\", the protagonists bawls their eyes out. They only knew her for less than a few days in-universe, two episodes overall. And it's instantly negated because they manage to salvage her data and convert her into an in-game item. Yui's character arc was one of the worst episodes of the series because of its contrived, weak, forced, sorry excuse for drama. In fact, any sense of suspense is gone when you realize that Kirito will win the fight by pulling straight out of the ass some brand new skill that was never seen before.\\n\\n\r\nThe second arc (Episodes 15 through 25) titled Fairy Dance (although you don't really see any fairies dancing until like the last episode), is much, much worse as the many faults are present at a much grander scale. The setting here is ALfheim Online, which was developed using SAO as its base. When Kirito first logs into ALO, he finds that all his items and stats from SAO are carried over. So instead of starting over from Level 1, he becomes overpowered at start. It shows nothing but laziness in terms of game development in-universe and writing out-of. The story switches from \"struggle for survival\" to \"save the princess,\" but there's no real sense of emergency as ALO has a working logout function and no one dies for real if they die in-game. Also, Kirito does mostly everything except his self-stated objective, like it's the last thing on his to-do list.\\n\\n\r\nAnd just when you couldn't get enough of Yui, she comes back. That's right, she's going Turbo! I mentioned that his items carried over to ALO, but all but Yui can't be read by the game system. She acts as a guide fairy to Kirito, kinda like Navi from The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, only even more annoying because she knows about stuff that she shouldn't and it only works whenever the plot demands it.\\n\\n\r\nThe Big Bad of Fairy Dance, Nobuyuki Sugou, is way worse than Kayaba in terms of being an effective villain. First of all, this guy is more of a psychotic, pedophilic manchild than a real villain. The first thing he does when we're introduced to him is outright inform Kazuto, \"Hi, I'm the villain.\" No subtlety or ambiguity for Mr. Sugou. Also, the fanbase clearly does not hate him for his villainy. His plan basically involves manipulating the memories of the few hundred, Asuna included, that didn't escape SAO. But that's not the reason why the fans want this guy's head on a stick. The most heinous, evil, dastardly, utterly descipable crime against humanity that makes this guy lower than scum is molesting Asuna every chance he gets. To the fanbase, Sugou is Hitler compared to Kayaba.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, the show also portrays Kayaba as the lesser of two evils compared to Sugou, even though the former imprisoned and killed people and is pretty much indirectly responsible for the latter's actions, as well as every other antagonist that follows. While it is true that Sugou's plans are bad, Kayaba's are far worse, yet the show's idea of morality is completely backwards about it. Let's compare: Sugou's crimes only consisted of imprisonment and brainwashing of a few hundred, and sexual assault of one. Kayaba's crimes consist of imprisonment of 10,000 and murder of roughly a third of that number. \\n\\n\r\nMeanwhile, Asuna is reduced to nothing more than the worst kind of damsel-in-distress. She does more of nothing other than be Sugou's sex toy. She doesn't even try to defend herself or even attempt to push him away, she just sits there and let him have his way with her body. She tries to escape on one ocassion, but ends up getting tentacle raped (Oh, you heard me right) and recaptured just as quickly. Which brings me to my next point. This show is utterly misogynistic to the point that it's outright offensive. The first arc is bad about it, but the second arc is where it is almost blatantly shown in your face. At some point in the climax of the arc, Sugou attempts to rape Asuna in the game right in front of Kirito. This whole scene turns a revenge fantasy and it only serves to make the viewer hate the villain even more, which is not how to even write a villain. And don't even use the excuse \"Well, he's a villain so you're supposed to hate him.\" There are other ways to make the viewer hate the villain. Not only that, but when Kirito manages to put a stop to Sugou's actions, he brutally tortures him without any sense of remorse and even commits physical pain to him. While Sugou did basically do the same thing to him, Kirito does it back in an even worse scale and no one, not even Asuna, bats an eye. In fact, she's not the least bit traumatized over that she was sexually assaulted because Kirito saved her so all is good. This is obviously trivialized as a plot device and shows that the author clearly had no business in even toying with such a thing. If you can't write attempted rape without a serious meaning or purpose other than \"all bad guys are rapists\", then don't do it.\\n\\n\r\nAs Asuna plays damsel-in-distress, her role as a main character is given to Kazuto's younger sister (actually cousin), Suguha/Leafa. Aside from her huge boobies, she is a somewhat better character than Asuna in that her chemistry with Kazuto/Kirito is actually believable. But her character falls apart because of one fatal flaw: She falls victim to the pitfall of being a female character in SAO, and therefore fall in love with Kirito for no reason (That's right, we're approaching incest territory), only here it's different. She's in love with both Kazuto and Kirito, but she's unaware that they're one and the same. Same goes for Kazuto/Kirito, who's unaware that Leafa is Suguha. So it becomes more of a guessing game as to when they're going to find out, and when they do, the damage is already done and you don't really care anymore. And before anyone says that romantic relations between cousins are acceptable in Japan, let me point out that while that is indeed true, Kazuto and Suguha are not written as siblings and not cousins, which actually makes her falling in love with him all the more pointless and stupid.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Well, the scenery is nice. That's the only good thing I can say. Character designs, not so much. In case you've figures out, Kazuto/Kirito is an emo antihero, so he dons clothing that is as black as his soul. Black hair, black eyes, Hell, even all but one of his weapons are colored black. Talk about uninspired. Most characters are drawn with only one facial structure. For example, Take Kirito's design, add light-brown waist-length hair, light-brown eyes, and average-size breasts and you've got Asuna. In fact, the moeblob looks like she was recycled from a previous character's design. The action scenes aren't compelling at all, but made cheaply and lazily with single still-frames in almost every fight. There are a few exceptions, but it only means that the animation staff felt like wasting their effort and budget on facepalm-worthy humor instead of quality fighting scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThere's only little I can say about the music. I've heard good things about Yuki Kajiura's score and her music here is pretty much the only thing about Sword Art Online worth mentioning. Although it gets very repetitive most of the time. Only one track has stuck to my mind and it only plays whenever Kirito is about to win a fight. It's a shame that it's sadly wasted on something so awful.\\n\\n\r\nNow the very worst fault that Sword Art Online has is its very fanbase itself. Usually, I won't talk about a series' fanbase when judging a series, but this is a special case because of their' foolish blindness to blatantly obvious flaws that even the brain-dead can find. You will find lots of users and their so-called reviews here that praise this show. Those guys are the suckers who was unfortunate to be sold only by its premise, which is interesting but has been done before (Hello, .hack franchise), and ignore everything else. The premise can only go so far, but how it is executed is what really matters.\\n\\n\r\nThis show has the stupidest fanbase ever since they probably like anything that looks like a terribly written fanfic written by a teenager. And from what I've heard, Kawahara wrote the first novel (or maybe the preliminary story) when he was a teen. It definitely shows. There is absolutely no effort put into this story and characters whatsoever. And once again, he admits that he basically wrote the story without even applying any form of logic. I'm beginning to think that he didn't write SAO just to tell a story, but so that it can become popular for all the wrong reasons, sell tens and thousands of volumes, and leave quality works underappreciated and selling poorly. Basically, a cheap cash-in. In other words, it's no better than moe junk.\\n\\n\r\nThank you, Reki Kawahara. Modern anime has gone down the toilet because of your actions.\\n\\n\r\nHere's why I hate this show's fanboys: They said that it would be great. I took their word for it. I enjoyed the first few episodes. But as time went on, my enjoyment decreased as I became aware of flaws, and fans get angry because I didn't enjoy it like they wanted me to. SAO fanboys hate it when someone points out what's wrong with it because SAO is the perfect wish-fulfillment fantasy, and when the \"haters\" question said fantasy by pointing out the issues, fanboys get hostile because they feel offended on a personal level. They can't accept reality because the truth is just too harsh for them.\\n\\n\r\nSword Art Online is basically a textbook example of how to make an awful anime by relying on wish fullfillment and asspulls to tell the story. It is a power fantasy: Its message is basically telling you to reject your own reality in favor for their fantasy. I think that message is a load of bollocks and shows that some people who falls for this is in need of a reality check. Want an actual MMO anime that does everything that Sword Art Online fails at in that it actually develops its characters, doesn't cater to the lowest common denominator, and doesn't insult your intelligence right in your face? I recommend watching .hack//SIGN for its psychological aspects and meaningfully-written characters and Log Horizon for its world-building aspects and actually thought-out MMO functionality. It's hard for me to actually fathom how this show is so highly rated because it does EVERYTHING wrong on so many levels. The only thing it does right is make itself, and Kawahara, into a complete joke.",

            "content": "\"This show is nothing more than childish story with additional adult scenes within it\"\r\nSword art online is a very popular anime, no doubt about it, but however this anime not deserved to be this popular. appalling, horrible, pathetic is the best word to describe this show. Many people love this show too much, without even think how can that happened, why every nonsense scenes or moments occurred. And at the end that's all happened thanks to the main character, why is it? i will explain it later, first of all\r\nThe story is centered on anti social people who trapped in a Virtual Reality Massive MultiplayerOnline Role-Playing Game (VRMMORPG) called Sword Art Online where the player will die for real when their hp reach 0. however its a amazing idea to make a story takes time in the future about virtual reality game, that could make me looking forward to it when this show still on going. The story was great when i know all players in this game will die for real if they not struggle to survive, it makes this show more emotional when some of the characters in the brink of death, but however there is one of the 10.000 players can denied the systems of the game, and ruin the story.\\n\\n\r\nAfter the episode 15 the story become even worse than before, the story turn into cartoon story for child under 5 years old, where the hero's girlfriend kidnapped by some one strange, and the hero take her back with a miracle that doesn't makes any sense. However too many people said that the story of this show is amazing, but for me this show is nothing more than childish story with additional adult scenes within it.\\n\\n\r\nEven though the story is horrible, the art and sounds was great, i don't know how to explain it, but when you see the art and sound of this show you will think that it will be a great anime, and for me the first time i saw the opening theme of this show i really love this show and thought it would be a great show after all and make me have a high expectation about this show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters, maybe this is why i really hate Sword art online. \\n\r\nThe main character, Kirito is a person who will not giving up something important to him no matter what. He can do anything he want to do, in fact he is the chosen one from the 10.000 other players that exist. He can kill some boss at that game by himself, when the other players need to party around a hundred players to kill the boss. Kirito is just like a god of that world, he can do anything if he want to, even though he cant do that things, a miracles will appears any time !!! \\n\r\nif you watched this show you will already know that kirito ever in the brink of death situation, not once or twice, but more than 5 times, LOL !!!\\n\r\nKirito is a normal player but he can defeat the Game Masters in a game Not Once, but twice. No doubt about it, Kirito is a overpowered main character that can do anything that act like a GOD in every game he played, Pathetic.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters is fine, fine doesn't mean its great.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, to be honest, i cant understand how could people enjoy this show. This is annoying, pathetic, horrible too many scenes that doesn't makes any sense. For me this show is really make me suffer, every episodes every scenes make me want to crush my computer and say \"How Could That Happened !!!\".\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this show is annoying, and when i know many people think that this show is great, its just makes this show even more worse. As i said before \"This show is nothing more than childish story with additional adult scenes within it\"",

            "content": "Some people likes it. Some people hates it. Some people finds it overrated. However, SAO is definitely one of the most anticipated, hyped-up, popular, and controversial anime series of the year. It is one of the most debated series with its various themes, characters, plot, artwork, music, and other factors. The series is adapted from the light novel written by Reki Kawahara, with illustrations by Abec.  It has gained enormously popularity despite the way it originally was created. Indeed, the series has earned mass amount of sales revenue, topping the sales' chart, spawning video games, manga, side stories, and last but not least, theanime series.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime series is adapted from the light novels of the same name written by Reki. He is known for his themes of incorporating a boundary between fiction and reality related to the cyber world as one of his other popular works known as Accel World. But that's whole other story. \\n\\n\r\nI have to admit. I was quite excited with the pilot episode. The idea of being trapped in another virtual environment where our very own lives are at stakes is an eye catcher. It is dangerous. It is deadly. And it puts your skills to the test where you realize it's not longer some virtual game you play for some high score because once you die, it's GAME OVER for real. But of course, Sword Art Online isn't by all means any original piece of work. Series like .hack//Sign, Summer Wars, and even old school series like Digimon Adventures have these themes. Sword Art Online has most of these as sources and presents in a more dangerous way. In other words, it's all or nothing. Once you're logged in, you're not going to get out until you beat the game.\\n\\n\r\nWelcome to Sword Art Online.\\n\\n\r\nThe series does bring promising ideas like I've mentioned before. The pilot episode shows the horror of the players' faces where they realize their lives are changed forever. The theme of conquering floors to reach a final boss seems intriguing and some of you watching the series might even wish you were there especially when you were younger and conquering floors yourselves like some classic MMORPG games. The idea of these all sound interesting and SAO makes a good impression at first. However, it doesn't last. \\n\\n\r\nFrom the first two episodes, the series maintains its reputation. The promising trailer sticks to its point and we are introduced with some of the main characters. However, it later show signs of shifting apart. Out of nowhere, there are side stories that are presented. Additionally, some of the main supporting characters gets lesser and lesser roles. At some points, it almost feel like a \u201cmonster of the week\u201d phenomenon where each episode presents a different side story. Oh, and the dangers of the SAO world seems to be shifted as well. Originally, there were pkers but the idea of them actually becoming a significant threat is weakened from the beginning. It is debatable how this series came together like this from the first few episodes to be honest. I mean, there are stuff of what we mainly see in MMORPG games but some of it just doesn't seem to shine itself.\\n\\n\r\nNow, adaptations aren't easy and fans (especially one with such a large fan base) always expect some greatness. But did SAO achieve greatness? From the first half, certainly not. The side stories' episodes does bring some of the other mechanics and a more detailed way of exploring the SAO world. However, it masks itself of the real story and what's to come. It's almost as if it's purposely making the fans wait for what's to come in these episodes. The way this approach is being handled is a flaw in my perspective as impatience takes ticks is way in.\\n\\n\r\nThat's just the first bite of the dish though.\\n\\n\r\nThe series does eventually draw its back to the main story but divides itself into two sections \u2013 Sword Art Online and later on, ALO or known as ALfheim Online. So essentially, it's almost like watching a two core series in one package with a small break in between. \\n\\n\r\nThe package doesn't stop there though because coming with it is the characterization of the two main characters of the series \u2013 Kazuto Kirigaya (Kirito) and Asuna Yuuki. \\n\\n\r\nInitially, Kirito is one of those loner guys who wants to keep to himself but has a kind and courageous heart who is willing to help others. However, that sort of personality doesn't work well in SAO or any MMORPG especially since joining guilds and conquering beasts requires teamwork and motivation. Thus, he makes friends with other characters throughout the series as well as being an official guild member. \\n\\n\r\nNow, the friends that Kirito makes are all strangely of the opposite sex, in other words, girls. Yes, they play the game as well and what's more strange is that most of them seems to have a thing for Kirito. As the series progresses, it almost seems as if Kirito is forming a harem of his own. In fact, no girl is safe; Whether you're a beauty, a blacksmith, a beast tamer, or fairy. This is likely due to the fact that he is a much higher level, has a kind heart, and is protrayed as a \u201cGary Stu\u201d character where he is able to overcome any obstacle with eace. Oh, and let's not forget the Desu Ex Machina factor where Kirito is able to solve an unsolvable problem with some divine intervention. His characterization also has a problem in which his skill level is portrayed as a very high level but the series does not portray on how he manages to obtain a feat. Furthermore, Kirito doesn't really seem to have an interesting personality. The only time he really shines is during his heroic speeches or interacting with the other characters. \\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, there's Asuna Yuuki. Originally portrayed as an admired girl with equally admiring traits in combat, she is the one that Kirito shares a dynamic relationship the most. In fact, the later episodes explores some of their relationship that began from strangers, to teammates, to friends, and later to something more. As dynamic as that all sounds, it doesn't mix right. Some of the sequences are rushed too much and the deus ex machina factor comes in. Out of nowhere occasionally, the problem becomes a solution where Kirito uses his Gary Stu abilities to solve them with the help of Asuna. However, I do admit that some of the relationship between the duo are relaxing to watch that balances in between the intensity of the fights involving the bosses and the dangers of the SAO world. \\n\\n\r\nOn the ALO side, the series' relationship between the duo is drawn away due to certain circumstances. Oh but that's not all. Another character with admirable tits and a peculiar relationship with Kirito is introduced. The chemistry between them is more of one sided and seems more like just a friend zone scenario till later on when a startling revelation is revealed. It's safe to say that Kirito's development by then has weakly worn down especially with Asuna, yet they remain close at heart.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall characterization of the series is only drawn out mediocre at best. Kirito, as I've already mentioned before, is the loner type who only seems to have good spotlights during action and interaction scenes. Asuna on the other hand is seen as a strong girl who often presents herself as entirely different character \u2013 sometimes she's a fragile girl with tears, other times, she swings that sword like a boss and shows why she is known as Asuna \u201cThe Flash\u201d Yuuki.\\n\\n\r\nLuckily, the concept of the series does remain intact. In other words, the theme of the virtual world is still there. There are the bosses, the floors to be cleared, player environment, items being bought/sold/traded on the market, guilds open to join, and other things you typically seem in the MMORPG world. However, the exploration of these themes are generally just mediocre with no exceptional twists. Furthermore, there are the random fan service themes presented throughout the series with Asuna Yuuki being the star of it all. She is like the desire of what the fans want and sometimes compared to one of the other main characters later on in ALO. (both physically and mentally of course)\\n\\n\r\nDem graphics:\\n\\n\r\nI will say describe the animation as graphics since the majority of the series is presented in virtual form  in nearly every episode. The artwork is portrayed as being slightly above mediocre. Every environment presented such as the city, guilds, sky, ocean, dungeons, etc are of the typical MMORPG settings. Even some of the monsters fits within the virtual boundaries. The way Kirito dresses is typical with his black outfit and standing out above some of the others. It's no surprise that he looks that way as if he was almost the leader of a wolf pack. On the other hand, Asuna dresses in ways that is portrayed as an female knight. Later on, it becomes more balanced with the duo in some more casual wear. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack and music of the series are alright. The OST curtsey of Yuki Kaijura seems to be limited where we often hear the same rhythms over and over again. The main SAO theme that plays during battle seems also as if it's trademarked to Kirito, especially during his desu ex machina scenes. However, it does get to the point during some of the boss fights where the intensity boils up. The first OP song, \"crossing field\" by LiSA of the first half is actually well presented with some glimpse of foreshadowing and a montage of the supporting characters. The second OP song, \"INNOCENCE\" by Aoi Eir\u201d from the latter half seems to be more of a monotone where we see mostly Kirito and his side with the addition of a new female character. The ED songs are just mediocre, however.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment? I'd say this series is just slightly mediocre at best for me. The first arc concludes its story and leaves the viewers to a wondering of what's to come next. The certain events from the arc puts a nail into some of fan's original expectations with the side episodes and fan service being a main factor to blame. Well, the concept is still quite interesting and coming into SAO as an anime fan did satisfy me at that part. However, the characterization and the characters themselves are cliched and flawed along with some of the themes. \\n\\n\r\nThe artwork and soundtrack are there to backup the virtual environment. At times, it's serious and at others, it seems like a romantic comedy. And of course, SAO tries to present these all at once and it just doesn't work out as some may expected to be. To enjoy or not to enjoy? That's the question. It's hard to say really but some of the inconsistencies and weak development of the writings refrained me from giving this a higher score. In the end, this series is viewed from a different perspective to everyone. It's no doubt though that it's one of the most popular series of the year and possibly more to come. I know this review is quite long but time flies fast especially in the virtual world.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading my review :)",

            "content": "First of all, I apologize for my poor writing skills. It's never been my strong suit.\r\nWhen I first watched Sword Art Online (commonly nicknamed 'SAO'), it was because my friend, whom has an anime taste basically identical to mine, recommended it. At this point only two episodes had been released, and it was my first time watching an anime week by week, instead of watching it all at once like I usually do. I watched the two existing episodes and enjoyed them, but as the weeks went on, both my friend and I were left wondering why he recommended it to me in the firstplace.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThe story is definitely nothing new. Kid plays video game, kid gets trapped in video game, kid has to escape video game. Of course, this kid (Kazuto Kirigaya, better known as his screen name 'Kirito') got the opportunity to beta test the game for like a day, so obviously he's better than everyone else. The entire show is just Kirito doing cool things, beating bosses alone that people can't even do in groups of 200, and meeting new \"friends\" that only have a few minutes of screentime but still end up considering Kirito their bff. There are ridiculous timeskips, leaving no room for character development, and episodes 3-7 are just filler to make Kirito look cooler. Of course, these episodes, like everything else in this anime, have the potential to contribute to the plot, seeing as he meets some new people. But again, like everything else in the anime, they don't. The characters never show up again until the last episode where they're celebrating Kirito's existence. The show starts out with everyone being trapped inside the game, which develops this fear, because hey, if you were trapped somewhere and if you died in there you died in real life, it'd be kind of scary. But of course, the fear weakens when Kirito easily conquers every boss with no struggle, it weakens even more with the frequent timeskips, and it's completely eliminated when they escape SAO and start the second game, where you can leave any time you want. That's right. In the second arc/game, you are a fairy prancing and flying through the forest, the ultimate goal is to be able to fly forever, and you can log off whenever you want. It completely destroys any suspense there was left, and sucks the fun out of it. Of course, they add one more element in an attempt to add suspense: Asuna is a damsel in distress and Kirito has to save her. Really, really lame.\\n\r\n1/10. SO much wasted potential, it's sickening.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe only redeeming quality of SAO. The art style is very nice throughout the first arc. It's very pretty and fun to look at. Of course, visual stimulation will only get you so far, especially when they get lazy and start cutting corners in the second arc because they have people hooked already. But in the first arc, the art is very nice, and it was definitely one of the big contributors to my watching it. I wish they would have kept the niceness throughout the second arc, but hey, we can't really expect much from this anime.\\n\r\n8/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nOST is gorgeous. I really enjoyed it. The OPs were fantastic (especially the first one. LiSA is fantastic.), the EDs were good, and the OST as a whole was very, very well done. Voice acting was average (referring to the sub, I'm not going to bother with the dub because that means I have to 1. watch a dub, and 2. rewatch this monstrosity), I don't really have many complaints in this department.\\n\r\n7/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThis is going to be a long section because this is the absolute worst part of SAO. It's not that the characters were bad, none, for the exception of Kirito, were bad characters. But the characters only show up for about five minutes before Kirito decides he's too good for them and moves on. (Though even after he ditches them, they still fawn over him and think he's the *~*~*~~*coolest guy evarrr!!!!!!~*~*~*~. This is literally the entire point of all of the characters. To make Kirito look cool.) Early on, we're introduced to Klein, who in any other anime, would actually contribute to the plot. In this anime, however, he does not. He hangs out with Kirito for the first couple episodes, has Kirito show him the ropes, and then goes on his way. He runs into Kirito a few times throughout the anime, but he contributes almost nothing. Which is extremely disappointing, because I thought he was pretty funny. This is the case with almost all of the other characters Kirito meets (with the exception of Asuna, whom I will get to soon). Kirito meets the character, Kirito helps the character because Kirito is better than everyone else, audience is left expecting the character to join Kirito on his quest because hey, they're on the cover art for Pete's sake!, audience is sorely disappointed when they never show up again because Kirito is a \"lone wolf\" (aka he's too good for everyone and doesn't want to waste his time with them). This happens for a while with the closest thing we get to a heroine, Asuna. Asuna herself, I thought was very cute, and I enjoyed her. But of course, along with all of the other characters, she is only there to make Kirito look cool. They meet, hang out for a while, they part ways... but then they meet up again about two years later. At this point, everyone is like, \"Holy crap! A character besides Kirito that has more than two episodes of screentime!\" and it is a glorious occasion for all. The two hang out for a bit, and suddenly, they're in love! I don't know about you guys, but I don't meet someone, not see them for ~2 years, find them again, spend a day with them, and then fall in love. But Asuna did, and it was one of the worst things to happen to the anime. Asuna was a very enjoyable character until her and Kirito got \"married\", got an in-game house together, and adopted a kid who was probably only a few years younger than them. A good chunk of time is dedicated to the two playing house together, and of course, a good chunk of THAT time is spent trying to make Kirito look cool. Asuna then becomes this lame woobie damsel in distress whom Kirito has to go save. Extremely disappointing. Literally every single girl character, except for *maybe* Silica and Yui because they're like 8, falls in love with Kirito. Including his sister/cousin/who even knows anymore. Yes. You read that right. In the second arc, the main female character is his sister/cousin who is in love with the real world Kirito, but of course, to get over irl!Kirito, she falls in love with gameworld!Kirito. Who is the same guy. This, of course, upsets her greatly because who wouldn't be mentally scarred if they realized that they were in love with their brother? But Kirito doesn't really care. He just likes to look cool.\\n\r\nDue to the fact that every single character is only there to make Kirito look cool, I give characters a 1/10.\\n\\n\\n\r\nKirito:\\n\r\nI hate this kid so much he gets his own section. Kirito is a teenage boy who likes video games, just like every other teenage boy. He beta tests SAO for like a day, and of course, because of this, he's the SAO master. He can beat anybody in a duel, can solve any mystery, and get any girl. He doesn't join any guild (well, he briefly joins a tiny guild full of people who don't know what they're doing, but they all get killed because Kirito is cocky as hell), which would mean an instant death for any other character, but of course, since Kirito is the best player in all of SAO for some reason, he doesn't need a guild to beat ~75 bosses and the final boss. He just does it all himself, no biggie. Now anybody who has ever played any MMO ever, would agree that this is ridiculous and extremely unrealistic. You play WoW and go into a dungeon alone, you get slaughtered in less than a minute. That's just how it works. You're supposed to go in with a team. But Kirito is too cool for school and goes it alone. And of course, he succeeds. No big deal. Oh, also, he has an ~**~*~ultra secret rare skill that nobody gets but him~**~*~*~. (Aka he gets to wield two swords, which isn't that big of a deal but of course since it's Kirito it means a ton and everyone is amazed. I'm not that surprised that the other characters thought it was cool that he got two swords, since it is an ~**~*~ultra secret rare skill*~**~~*~ that nobody else gets, but they act like he's a god walking among them. But of course, that's no surprise because that's how he's portrayed throughout the entire anime. As a god roaming the virtual streets of SAO.) As previously mentioned, every single girl falls in love with him instantaneously because he's oh so cool and oh so badass. It's ridiculous, unrealistic, and nauseating.\\n\r\nIf I could give negative scores, I would give Kirito a -6000/10. But because I have to pick from 1-10, I'll give him a 1/10. That's being pretty generous.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nSAO is the definition of wasted potential. Kirito is the definition of a Gary Stu. Characters get very little screentime, and are only there to serve the purpose of making Kirito look cool. This is definitely the most disappointing anime I have ever watched, and I feel as if if being exactly like Kirito wasn't every nerdyboy's dream and Asuna wasn't every nerdyboy's dream girl, this anime wouldn't be nearly as popular as it is.\\n\r\nDon't waste your time. Popular =/= good. Overall score: 3/10.",

            "content": "The story revolves around Kirito, a young boy who is trapped in a virtual game, where gameover equals the highest penalty: the actual death of the player. Many people might wonder why the novel itself received so much attention. Certainly, the story is not really new to the trend nowadays but it was somewhat ahead of the curve when it was first written in 2002. A well-written plot combines with actions and refreshing romance elements, and put altogether into a fantastic MMO world which can only exist in our imagination \u2013 these premises alone are enough to melt the soft hearts of many readers, thusraising its popularity. As the story goes by, there are many things to be amazed by creative minds of the author as he successfully portrayed the beautiful world of Aincrad.\\n\\n\r\nSo, to the anime part:\\n\\n\r\n--- Story ---\\n\\n\r\nAs a novel reader, I always seperate adapted products (including manga, anime, visual/light novel) into 2 type: the ones which have potential to be good, and those that do not (or has a lower chance of success). In most cases, visual/light novel adaptions hardly tend to be as great as its origin. Sadly, same goes for SAO\\n\\n\r\nSAO well started at two first episode, which could hold the potential to be good as many decent light novel adaption. But as the story goes on, it begins to show a lack of comprehensiveness in plot. \\n\\n\r\nFor example, \"Red nose reindeer\" is a side story in volume 2 which contains a lot of developments and touching scene, as well as deep inner thoughts of the main character, was crammed into the length of a single episode. Despite that, the episode was well delivered, the lack of minor details was acceptable, because audiences were able to feel the tragedy that this episode wanted to portray. However, Episode 4 was a huge disappointment - instead of delivering the regrets of Kirito by highlighting on Silica and Pina relationship like in the LN, the episode was half-heartedly written, and Silica was only a mean to be used. Episode 4 technically ignored Kirito's feelings as he seeks for salvation by saving Silica and her trusted partner. Unnecessary fan services, loli stereotypes fed the audience and ruined this episode, even though it was not supposed to be fun to begin with. For example, Silica could have used her time thinking about Pina, instead of worrying about her appearance in front of Kirito. \\n\\n\r\nIn the following episodes, the anime felt like an episodic series, when random stories happened, most of which were hardly related to the main plot. \"They were only side-stories\" is the perfect excuse for poorly written plot up to this moment, but even so they could have done the side-stories better. That said, the anime still has some positive points which attracts audiences, especially new comers. The plot is interesting, the world of Aincrad is animated realistically on-screen, and the sweet romantic moments between Kirito and Asuna are heart-warming to watch. \\n\\n\r\nScore: 7.0/10\\n\\n\r\n--- Characters ---\\n\\n\r\nKirito is first introduced as a lone wolf, an unsociable young boy with great gaming skills. We can see that his character was well developed from the start, with his turning from a solo player into a cooperative player by joining a guild. He began to familiarize with the guild members and share their experiences, joys, and sadness. Then he met Sachi, a girl with an open heart, and gradually realized how important his existence was to others, and figured out his true purpose in life. It would\u2019ve been good if the anime had continued down that road. But instead, he was then built into a cool \"black swordman\" character, aimlessly traveled around Aincard with unclear purposes and did whatever he wanted. To sum up, as the story progresses, Kirito seems to have less depth as a character than he once had in the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nAsuna truly is the most easily-favorited female character this season: Possessing tsun characteristics, a good-looking figure, excellent skills as a player and even great cooking skills, she\u2019s a perfect female partner which can hardly be found in most anime nowadays. But what she still lacks is the screen time to show her romantic feelings for Kirito. She has been in relationship with Kirito for a long time, but with the limited length of an anime episode, it feels like their romantic developments were forced and unnatural. Aside from that, she is portrayed as a energetic, lovely and easily embarrassed girl. Her interactions with Kirito are interesting and somewhat entertaining, relaxing to watch in the whole series. (Oh and it could be considered one of the main reasons to keep audiences watching the show).\\n\\n\r\nOther minor characters have made their appearance as well, but they haven\u2019t present any special traits because of inadequate screen time. Nevertheless, there are a few exception:\\n\r\nSachi is the shy-type girl who was introduced in episode 3. Just looking at her makes everyone wants to hold her dearly in their arms and protect her. She was one of the few characters that I wanted to stay longer, as one single episode was not enough. Lisbeth is also one of my favorite girl in the show. With her lively traits, she gives Kirito a hard time to deal with and also holds the feelings and antics of any normal girl: filled with happiness when she is in love, smile beautifully when she gathers enough courage to confess, and cry silently when she has a broken heart.\\n\\n\r\nScore: 7.0/10\\n\\n\r\n--- Art works/Animations ---\\n\\n\r\nA-1 pictures are doing a good job adapting SAO into an anime. The sceneries are beautifully drawn as they portray the realistic world of Aincrad, and most of its details seem to fit with what I have imagined when I was reading the novel: from the cloudless blue sky over the vast greenness of the grass field that Kirito always lies on, to the sight of the forest stretched to as far as the horizon, or the barren wasteland in some of the dungeons. \\n\\n\r\nThe colors are bright, but seems unrealistic like Code Geass, or any similar shows which use a same type of colour for each single part on character's body, except there were some shaders which varied to different colours when the lights reflect on. And another thing I do not like, is that having familiarized with art works from novel, I found the art styles to be a little annoying cause it came from the same character designer with Working! (Shingo Adachi). All the characters are somewhat having the \"same face syndrome\", the term describes for itself when every character tends to have similarity in faces, just by changing hair styles and colors to make them look different. \\n\\n\r\nThe battle animations are not very good either, they put up some good battle scenes at first, with smooth animation and lots of frames in a single scene. But all of that quickly became disappointing in several of the subsequent episodes, as there were no actual action scene at all, except some of what can only be called \"slideshow battle sequence\". Nevertheless, when it came to important scenes which requires actual action, they showed some high-quality action sequences. So to conclude, the animation was quite hit-and-miss, but some of its problems are understandable as they can be considered typical ways to reduce budget in anime production.\\n\\n\r\nScore: 7.0/10\\n\\n\r\n--- Music/Sound ---\\n\\n\r\nSAO has a dream team of music/sound production, the famous musician Yuki who composed theme song in Kara no Kyoukai, music in Fate/Zero, Pandora Hearts and many more. Just only her name affirms the high quality of music in SAO. But that alone is not enough, Sho Wanatabe ( Madoka theme song composition, F/Z) also joined her forces. And to top all that, they have LiSA, who is well-known for the works in F/Z and AB!, performed the OP for SAO. These prominent musician make SAO one of the best this season in terms of music quality.\\n\r\nScore: 9.0/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nWhen I heard they were going to cram 4 volumes into 25 episode, I knew that the potential for SAO adaption to be as flawless as the original was minimal. [As I've experienced, there are always lack of details, poor developments, several plot holes which affect the flow of story, due to the limited length that any adaption has to face with]. Keeping that in mind, without having any expectation, I watch the anime for its own merits, I enjoy what the adaption has to deliver. Sometimes when they failed to do justice to a scene I like, or leave it out of the script completely, I would feel sad, but I understand that each adaption has its own circumstances, and we - the audiences - have to bear with it.\\n\\n\r\nScore: 9.0/10\\n\\n\\n\r\n---Conclusion---\\n\\n\r\nI know my review is long, but I will appreciate if you read it to the end. I want to say for all those who have dropped the show: give it a few more episode cause the story will be much more interesting and touching in the next couple of episode. It's a bit hasty to drop it right now. \\n\\n\r\n===============\\n\r\n       Story: 7/10                    \\n\r\n       Characters: 7/10           \\n\r\n       Animation: 7/10             \\n\r\n       Sound/Music: 9/10         \\n\r\n       Enjoyment: 9/10            \\n\r\n-----------------------------\\n\r\n        Overall: 8/10\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nNote: there will be an update when the show is finished.",

            "content": "\u201cA person is very strong when he seeks to protect something.\u201d - Heathcliff\r\nSword Art Online; a show loved by many, yet perceived as one of the worst series ever created by a lot of people. The show certainly wasn\u2019t perfect, but it was far from being bad, and I think a lot of the hate it receives is unfair, because it\u2019s just people trying to point out every single little flaw and turn it into something huge.\r\nStory: (7 / 10)\r\nSAO is effectively divided into two large arcs, the first one being what the series was basically \u201cadvertised\u201d to be; people are stuck in a game,and have to beat the game to be able to leave. Now, because this arc spans quite a long period of time, two things appear which are worth noting. \\n\\n\r\nThe first one is the slightly \u201cweird\u201d pacing off the show. At times you will see the characters being on say, floor 20 in one episode, and in the next they\u2019re on floor 40, which could easily make you think that you just missed an entire episode. This is not the case, and this was apparently a big problem for some people, and I do agree that the series could\u2019ve benefitted from expanding the first arc to play out over a course of 25 episodes, simply removing the second arc (we\u2019ll talk about this soon). I personally didn\u2019t have much of a problem with the pace, as each episode\u2019s actual content was more than enough to keep me interested, and while it\u2019s not really an appropriate excuse, it may be worth noting that the story plays out like this because that\u2019s how the novel was written...\\n\\n\r\nThe second thing is that quite a lot of the episodes in the first arc are not always about directly trying to clear the game, and as such many of them may very well be seen as fillers. These episodes will often be Kirito (the series\u2019 protagonist) helping players of lower level (or anyone else in distress, for that matter), or simply spending time with his friends/loved ones. \\n\r\nI think it may come as a surprise to some when this series, which you probably thought was gonna be all action-packed and all, turns out to spend so much time on the relationship of two young players, and how they adapt to this new world. \\n\r\nThe show has enough action and fighting scenes to make up for having this slower paced, more SOL-esque section, which I thought was pretty good, nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the second arc, this is where the story sort of... drops a bit, so to speak. There are some major changes between the two arcs, and it changes a lot of the \u201ccore mechanics\u201d around which the first arc was based, as well as replacing the majority of the characters, and basically nullifying that same feeling of danger and suspense the first arc poses.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s not to say the story couldn\u2019t be interesting and well-written anyway, but it really has nothing on the previous arc... While I didn\u2019t really dislike it as much as many other people, I certainly found it less entertaining, but to me, the rest of the series more than made up for this part.\\n\\n\r\nArt: (8 / 10)\\n\r\nIf nothing else, the art in SAO is simply great. I liked the artstyle, even though it\u2019s really nothing special, as well as the character designs. The animations are fluid most of the time, and the fighting scenes are very enjoyable, and well done if you can overlook the very tiny flaws which present themselves. \\n\\n\r\nDuring some scenes, at certain points in the fight (like when someone gets hit), there\u2019ll often be either a very short scene consisting of just a still picture, or a very slowed down scene, to really emphasise that someone did actually hit something. It\u2019s not really a big problem though, as the still pictures are barely shown for any time, and they do look very cool, and I think this all comes down to people nitpicking to find more stuff to complain about. \\n\r\nThe rest of the fighting scenes look totally OK, and the use of \u201csword art\u201d adds a nice tone to the frames, so to speak. \\n\\n\r\nSound: (9 / 10)\\n\r\nThe music was also a big plus, in my opinion. The soundtrack is all-in-all pretty great, with a lot of songs both fitting for the more intense fighting scenes, as well as the more \u201crom-com\u201d-styled parts. The two opening themes, \u201cCrossing Field\u201d by LiSA and \u201cInnocence\u201d by Aoi Eir, are both more upbeat and fast-paced songs, while the two ending themes, \u201cYume Sekai\u201d by Tomatsu Haruka (the VA of Asuna) and \u201cOverfly\u201d by Haruna Luna, are both slower songs, which is most often more fitting for ending themes. \\n\r\nI think all of the songs fit the series (and their respective arcs) rather well, and overall there\u2019s really no problem with any of the songs from the series\u2019 soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting isn\u2019t amazing, but it\u2019s good enough, and manages to convey the feelings and messages that wants to be conveyed, so there\u2019s really no problem here either.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: (8 / 10)\\n\r\nOne of the most common complaints I see about SAO is \u201cthe characters are terribly written\u201d, and I feel like I completely missed this aspect of the show. I actually liked most of the characters, and the ones I didn\u2019t really like that all that much were often the bad guys, so you weren\u2019t really supposed to like them either, which I guess would make them well-written, in a way...\\n\\n\r\nKirito, our main character, was one of the few beta players of SAO, and this serves as an important plot-element, as he basically knows most things there is to know about the game, making him a very powerful player. At first his primary goal is more or less to just survive, but as he spends more time in Aincrad and starts caring about the people in this new world, his views changes, and soon enough he\u2019ll be the one sacrificing himself and helping out people in need. \\n\\n\r\nEven though many of the side-characters had rather little screen time compared to other characters (mostly one episode each), they were all very likeable characters, and there was never really a moment where I just wished the episode would end already, so that I didn\u2019t have to see more of this horrible character. \\n\\n\r\nA lot of the interaction between the various characters served as a sort of \u201ccomic relief\u201d, which was nice, and the relationship between Kirito and Asuna is definitely all but \u201cpoorly written\u201d. \\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned earlier, the majority of the characters are replaced during the second arc, and because of this I never really cared about the new characters all that much. They just didn\u2019t have enough screen time or impact on anything to really allow me to relate to them, or make any sort of connection.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (9 / 10)\\n\r\nI first found out about SAO through some random Youtube video mentioning it, and then looking at a quick summary of the plot. Because of this, I really knew nothing about the series except for the fact that it was set in a game world, and a friend had told me that the second half was a major disappointment. \\n\r\nMaybe it was because of my \u201cignorance\u201d, or lack of hype about the show that made it so enjoyable to me, but I really didn\u2019t have a problem with anything which people generally complain about. Sure, the second half is slightly worse, but I certainly don\u2019t think it\u2019s enough to mark the series as \u201cbad\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re looking for a super serious show about the struggle of 10 thousand people stuck in a game, trying to beat the final boss and avoid death, then this show might not be for you. However, if you\u2019re fine with the aforementioned concept acting as more of a \u201cground layer\u201d to the series, and having a slightly more light-hearted tone to it, based more around character interaction than just awesome fights, then this may be for you (if you can overlook the flaws and the changes in second arc). \\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+ Cool concept (even if it wasn\u2019t executed perfectly).\\n\r\n+ Very likeable characters.\\n\r\n+ Very good art.\\n\r\n+ Pretty awesome fighting scenes (most of the time).\\n\r\n+ Superb soundtrack.\\n\r\n-----------------------\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Weird pace during first arc.\\n\r\n- Major changes in second arc, makes for a slightly worse second half.\\n\r\n- Very minor \u201cannoyances\u201d during fight scenes.",

            "content": "Right, so i planned to finally update this after finishing all 25 episodes.\r\nAs it stands, SAO is one of those anime that either sucks you in enough for you to overlook some of the glaring flaws, or puts you off. And despite how much I enjoyed the anime, it definitely had huge flaws. \r\nThe story itself had a great premise; this is the reason how people are drawn into the anime. Players are trapped in a VR MMO, where death equals death in real life. Because of this, it's a survival test; there are some who would do anything to live, others who help outother people to live, etc. This is the setting that drew me in, that allowed me to enjoy the anime itself.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the story, I must note that the two arcs held different enjoyment values for me. Without spoiling much, the first arc captured me to the point where I went through most of the arc in a day, eagerly waiting for the next week's episode. The second arc, though, was a bit less enticing.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, where the setting shone, the characters... sort of fell. Rather, the development. The plot itself was fine, but the main problem with the characters is that they were too perfect. At a certain point, the two main characters Kirito and Asuna became \"perfect\", in the sense that they had no real \"flaws\" left. Ironically, this becomes a flaw for the series itself, because the characters end up becoming a bit flat. \\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the animation of the anime was great. The fights were well done (though full on fights were a bit scarce). The main part i enjoyed was the effective portrayal of an MMO. The menu screens, hp bars, all of that made SAO feel like an actual MMO. You could say it's to be expected, but it was great nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was great as well. The first opening, Crossing Field, stands as one of my favorite openings. Perhaps I just like LiSa's songs ( I loved Fate/Zero's opening as well), but I felt it fit the mood of the first arc well. The rest of the music fit well with the story- a gallant theme for the courageous moments, a tranquil theme for the calmer parts, etc.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnd now for the bias, the part I talked about earlier. I enjoy anime, and I enjoy MMOs. As a result, SAO just clicked for me. I could look over the character development issue, because the settings enraptured me. If it wasn't for the setting of the plot itself, this anime would really only be a 7 at best. But because the story was so engaging for me, I loved the show, enough to feel the enjoyment of a 10/10 even though there were huge flaws.\\n\r\nFor the sake of others who don't have such a preference like mine, the score I'd give it is obvious lower than a 10.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSAO will forever be one of those hate/love animes. It was one of the most hyped anime of the year, and despite its slight disappointments, it well deserves watching if you enjoy the premise of the story itself.",

            "content": "The synopsis of Sword Art Online (SAO) doesn't sound terrible.\r\nIf you are expecting a good quality work however, this is not the show to watch. What seems like a promising story, ultimately fails.\r\nI expected SAO to be like Battle Royale. \r\nNot in terms of the story but how it will be focused on the psyche of the characters. \r\nImagine.\r\nBeing forced to play a video game, where dying in this game means dying in real life. Every extra day you spend in this game, you stay motionless in real life. This will lead to (possibly permanent) paralysis and most likely, they are feeding you through atube. This is expensive and your family and friends are in great distress.\\n\\n\r\nThis is not a pleasant or/and peaceful scenario. Yet this is not reflected properly in the characters. What I mean by \"properly\" is having short-term and long-term impacts. Simply reacting is insufficient for a \"proper\" believable behaviour. Short-term impacts are the basis of long-term impacts. This must flow in a logical sense for a reasonable duration of progression and regression. Forgetting it the next scene as if it never happened, is the worst method of characterization. \\n\\n\r\nThis is why SAO ultimately fails. It does not develop the mental chaos, which is really the highlight of SAO-esque story. Due to this, everything falls apart. Especially, the characters. \\n\\n\r\n-ART-\\n\r\nIt's typical video game clothing. So I will not bash on how non-functional they are.(as video games tends to do that) But none of them are really that aesthetically pleasing or designed well according to the scenario. So, I give it a 4/10. \\n\\n\r\n-SOUND-\\n\r\nMusic should be used in harmony to create mood. \\n\r\nFew poor attempts have been made but overall, it fails to evoke anything out of the viewers. This is surprising, considering they chose the simple \"tried-and-proven\" type of music.\\n\\n\r\n-CHARACTER-\\n\r\nFlat as a cardboard.\\n\r\nThough we do not know the motivation behind why the character acts in the way they do, there is no sense of cohesion. \\n\\n\r\nThe inconsistency of Asuna and Kirito is mesmerizing. It's like they are a different person every scene.\\n\r\nEven if the author doesn't tell you the back story of a character, there should still be a cohesive feeling behind their actions.\\n\\n\r\nIs Kirito selfish person? If so, all his action should follow this to a certain extent.\\n\r\nAsuna moves away from Kirito and wants to be left alone at first. But after the boss fight, she even chases after Kirito. Why? \\n\\n\\n\r\n-ENJOYMENT-\\n\r\nThis is absolutely subjective because I cannot enjoy poor quality work.\\n\\n\r\n-OVERALL-\\n\r\nI give MAL ratings based on the word.\\n\r\n3 = poor \\n\r\n4=  decent.\\n\r\nThis is not decent by any means. It fails to develop any of the potential the story holds and does the remainder in a poor quality fashion.\\n\\n\r\nSAO sits somewhere between 2/10 to 3/10.",

            "content": "Sword Art Online is an either hit or miss anime. With the whole idea of depicting a future where the games you love can have real life consequences, SAO had alot of potential to illustrate real life conflicts we are currently facing with our boom in technology. However, it definitely only used a fraction of its potential, that I feel like could have been alleviated by making more episodes that could cover up many of the plotholes it fails to explain, with the story and characters being especially fragile. \r\nStory: The storyline of SAO could be summed up as very jumpy and inconsistent. The firstseason was filled with a bunch of characters that the main character, Kirito, had to interact with on his journey to beat SAO. Despite them feeling like fillers, I really enjoyed them, and how they were representative of potential future interactions in MMORPGs. I found the relationship between Kirito and Asuna to be especially touching, and definitely the best part of the series, despite it being little cliche. The series did annoy me with its random time skips and inadequate explanation of the game's mechanics, but for 25 episodes, I realized that they definitely made a good effort at it. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough the first arc of the series maintained a fast and pleasant pace, the second half of the series really tries to divert your attention to something entirely different from what the first half established. The entire ALO arc just felt very forced, and definitely slowed down the pace of the anime, taking a sharp turn away from the development of the two main characters in the first half of the series. I am probably not alone in my opinion that the ALO arc just felt no sense of urgency, that the SAO arc created. The last few episodes just felt significantly less motivated than they were for the SAO arc, and in the end, just felt like the characters were taking a game way too seriously. While the first half may have been one of my most lovable animes, I feel like I need to separate it from the second half, that just displays one of the biggest dips in quality I have ever seen in anime. \\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: There were obviously very high production values involved in the creation of the anime. The battle scenes and scenery were definitely one of the highlights of the show, with lots of details and vibrant colors. The soundtrack was also very good in my opinion, with several amazing battle/piano soundtracks, in addition to some of the best OP and EDs I have heard. The characters had extremely well made designs, which probably contributed to an overwhelming number of SAO cosplays. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I can honestly say that if you do not like the main characters, this is not the anime for you to watch. The personalities of the characters are pretty much the only things they have going for them. Most of the characters are quickly forgotten after a single episode, after (I know this sounds harsh) serving their purposes as sort of a side quest. Despite that, I found two of the characters to be very lovable: Kirito and Asuna. The greatest reason I continued watching was because I wanted to see where their relationship led them, and after the heartwretching emotions I felt towards the end of the SAO arc, I anticipated an equally or maybe even better conclusion to the series. However, the inclusion of the sister's relationship just seemed very irrelevant and out of place, and towards the end of the series, felt like it added unnecessary drama that contributed very little to the emotional impact of the series, and only created extremely awkward situations. The ALO arc completely took away from the relationship that was very well progressed and built up in the SAO arc, and despite how much I loved Kirito and Asuna's relationship in the first half, I found myself forgetting the emotions I felt as I watched through the second half. \\n\\n\r\nSAO is a great and fun anime if you simply just try not to think too hard about its flaws, and try to relate to the characters. While I feel many of the haters of this anime have their points, they are missing the real point of any anime: the enjoyment and emotional aftereffect they feel after it is over. Despite having a weak and inconsistent storyline and fickle and unnecessary character development, SAO was honestly a very enjoyable watch if you focus more on the adventure, and put yourself in the shoes of a character in the series. SAO will definitely strike a chord in the hearts of people who have known how great the adventure and thrill of playing a MMO can be. SAO translates those desires to anime form, and brings out some of the very best experiences you could possibly have in a future that may include virtual reality.\\n",

            "content": "Whew, this is my first review, hope it goes well. Not normally one to write reviews but I feel like I needed to comment on SAO. I would just like to remind everyone below that this is a matter of opinion, and I am just trying to express my opinion on SAO.\r\nSAO is somehow EXTREMELY popular, not exactly sure why, and before you rate this a thumbs down fan boys, read this review first.\r\nStory (3) - As I'm sure you are all aware of, SAO is based on VRMMORPGS, which basically let you jump into a game as if it is real life. To saythe least, the story isn't very original. Instead of having an interesting, unique, and original plot, the anime relies more on things like \"plot\" (.)(.) \\n\\n\r\nArt (8) - Animation throughout the series is well done. Other than a few shortcuts that are taken in the animation, it is very high quality. Props to that.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9) - SFX and music are well done and match the settings.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (2) - In my opinion, this is the point that is quite the stickler for me. As long as there is likable, and well developed characters, I tend to watch an anime. However, in the case of SAO, there is little to no character development. Other than Kirito, Asuna, and later Yui and Sugaha. All other characters show up for 1 or 2 episodes and leave, only to show up at the very end of the series. Furthermore, those four characters are filled with problems themselves. Kirito is much too perfect, being able to do anything even though there was no mention of it in the past episodes. In fact, in the beginning, he was just mentioned as a \"normal\" guy who plays video games. Asuna is quite the annoying tsundere that seems to have bipolar disorder. Her personality frequently changes without any cause behind it. Yui is lolicon bait and Sugaha is...yeah. Viewers are unable to make out their own opinion of the character, and are instead forced to take the opinion that the anime basically shoves in the viewers face. Basically, blunt and pointless actions are used to define the characters and are anything but subtle. Furthermore, villains are your everyday generic villains with no variety at all, other than poor reasoning behind their actions.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (4) - Putting aside poor characterization, plot holes, and other major and minor issues, the first arc of SAO was enjoyable.There was humor and it was just fun to watch. However, the second arc, Alfheim Online, was rushed. Characters in the Alfheim arc somehow become even worse than the first arc and it is not in the slightest bit enjoyable at all. Things got too serious and the entire arc just seemed pointless.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (4) - Overall, this anime was poorly done. Although the sound and art was well done, an anime is nothing without either or both story and characters. In this case, SAO lacks both. However, the first arc was quite enjoyable in some aspects of humor. Therefore, I would give Sword Art Online a 4.",

            "content": "SAO is the gold standard of wasted potential. \r\n\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606\r\nAll two of my followers have been yelling at me to review this masterpiece\u2014and it\u2019s shit. I\u2019ve never watched anything so hyped and so disappointing. The premise was so good only to be squandered like a lottery winner on cocaine and hookers.\r\n10,000 players are trapped inside an MMO. To get out they need to pass 100 levels, beat the final boss, and if they die in the game they die in real life.\r\nJust reading that premise set my imagination on fire. Two sentences had my mouth drooling with excitement. It was such an ambitious idea. I imaginedan elite team of writers must\u2019ve worked on it; men and women assembled from every corner of Japan. I imagined suspense, thrills, moral dilemmas, really dark shit happening. God help those girls trapped in there. It would\u2019ve been a commentary on the human condition when put under extreme circumstances. And it\u2019s a video game themed? Oh, Lordy, you convinced me at \u201cthe.\u201d I\u2019ll buy six copies.\\n\\n\r\nThen I finally watched it, and it was garbage.\\n\\n\r\n- Don\u2019t expect any tension, tragedy or even a struggle.\\n\r\n- Don\u2019t expect complex interpersonal or political conflicts.\\n\r\n- Don\u2019t expect commentary on the human condition, moral dilemmas, or psychology.\\n\r\n- Don\u2019t expect clever strategy or mind games.\\n\r\n- Don\u2019t expect anything resembling real-life MMO culture.\\n\r\n- Don\u2019t expect relatable characters or witty dialogue.\\n\r\n- Whatever your expectations are, throw them out, and lower them even further.\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t know where to begin. SAO fails on every level of basic writing. Let\u2019s be fair: I usually don\u2019t buy into hype, but SAO\u2019s premise has it built in. There\u2019s nothing modest about its idea, and when you can\u2019t deliver don\u2019t be fucking surprised when you get enough hatred to power a Tesla. If you handed this story to your professor you\u2019d be given an F and asked if you stole this off FanFiction.net.\\n\\n\r\nIf you must check out this garbage, I strongly recommend seeing the first episode; then imagining the studio burned down killing all its staff; and episode one was the only surviving copy because SAO peaks at episode one. I wish I were kidding, but I\u2019m not. The rest of the show drops the amazing premise to become a poorly written, amateur harem romance. It\u2019s like you\u2019re watching Schindler\u2019s List then it suddenly becomes American Pie.\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t know too much about the writer, but he\u2019s shown to be in the same amazing league as kids who shop at Hot Topic. How oblivious are you to not see how terrible your main character is? The main character has been described over and over as a \u201cGary Stu.\u201d It\u2019s a play on words from Mary Sue, a character type that\u2019s basically just too perfect. SAO\u2019s main character cannot escape even the lowest standard of a Gary Stu.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s see. He\u2019s too good looking because even another dude mentioned how attractive he was. He\u2019s too powerful; taking down bosses and groups of people with no issues. Great way to build tension there. He gets all the girls because in a game where there\u2019s a much lower population of female players he just gets all the hot bitches with no effort. He\u2019s fucking boring. I cannot even begin to describe his personality other than just existing. And this is the worst crime: he wears all black. I\u2019m not kidding. His entire outfit is a black trench coat, black fingerless gloves, even his fucking sword is black.\\n\\n\r\nLook, I get it. It\u2019s hard to write a main character. You want them to be likeable. They\u2019re the face of the show, but SAO\u2019s main character is nothing less than masturbatory wish fulfillment. Because writers want their characters to be liked they end up bland and uninteresting trying to appeal to everyone. It\u2019s okay to have a character that isn\u2019t liked. There\u2019s a difference between not liking them as a person and not liking them as a character. That\u2019s why villains are so much fun. You\u2019d be horrified at their shit in real life, but in a story they\u2019re fun and engaging. Most of all, make your main character relatable, and SAO\u2019s main guy is none of that.\\n\\n\r\nHis Mary Sue love interest isn\u2019t any better. In the first episode she comes off a mysterious, independent woman only to melt into a damsel in distress. She\u2019s also a guild leader, and she has a very high cooking skill level. Where the fuck did you find the time to learn that when you\u2019re leading players to escape the game with their lives? Are you guys even trying?\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing is all over the place. If you\u2019re going through 100 levels I expect 50 episodes. But, no, the show skips dozens of floors without any sense of time. Shit just happens. The story is bogged down by incredibly vapid slice-of-life episodes. You have a whole fucking world of engaging stories, but you focus on Gary Stu and Mary Sue going off to a lake house and fishing. Goddamn, remembering this shit makes me mad.\\n\\n\r\nGood pacing is gives a sense of struggle. You have your high point then your low point then another high point then another low point and so on. This is called writing. The worst sin is how they just glossed over 2,000 players dying. Not even a montage. They just mention it like a footnote. So much shit happens off screen why bother even having an anime?\\n\\n\r\nAnd if this show had even attempted to meet its ambitious premise then the final 10 floors would\u2019ve been the most agonizing, most intense, most tragic episodes where any hope of making out alive would\u2019ve  seemed impossible. But, nope, more harem shit.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, fine, now you have a romance. I have to accept it, but it\u2019s not even a good romance. A romance needs engaging characters, but when you have Gary Stu and Mary Sue I might as well be looking at a brochure. Two pretty people like each other and that\u2019s it.\\n\\n\r\nIs there anything I liked about this trash? I guess soundtrack was nice. The fantasy landscape and scenery was nostalgic to look at. Reminded me of my Runescape days. And when they did incorporate some MMO elements like messages and inventory that was kinda neat. Wish there was more of that shit.\\n\\n\r\nI dropped this after episode 14 because\u2014and this unbelievable\u2014they escape the MMO, and everything goes even deeper into shit.\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t understand the hype for this show or why it\u2019s so popular. My theory is that because there\u2019s always an influx of new anime fans that they don\u2019t grow up watching older stuff so they don\u2019t develop taste like older anime fans.\\n\\n\r\nYou\u2019re not supposed to watch only anime. You need to enjoy all sorts of entertainment from movies, books, TV shows, and video games. That\u2019s how you refine your taste. I suspect SAO is a lot of people\u2019s gateway anime in the same way Dragon Ball Z and Naruto are.",

\\n\r\nIt\u2018s your average show, like many other. + + But see, even average doesn\u2018t always bother.\\n\r\n+ I even rewatch the opening from time + + + + to time just for its beginning\u2018s catchy prime.  \\n\r\n+ + + + + So I conclude this review by expounding my final point in a clear way: + + + + + + \\n\r\n+ + + + + do not expect an awesome story, thrilling moments, more bloody prey, + + + + + +\\n\r\n+ + + + + + but instead an anime made out of popular and fan-serving material, + + + + + + +\\n\r\n+ + + + + + +which will at least be entertainment next to your breakfast cereal!

            "content": "As the most hyped show in 2012, Sword Art Online is known to be one of the most argued show that exists.  With one side saying its the best thing ever, and one side saying it's complete shite.  Nonetheless, onto the review.\r\nStory: In the year 2022, technology has advanced so far that people are able to put themselves into a virtual reality via a helmet which can transport people into a virtual realm.  This has led to the development of one of the most anticipated games, Sword Art Online.  With 10,000 people being allowed to play this game, everyone who hasa copy begins playing, and exploring the new virtual reality, until a few minutes after playing, the creator of SAO, Akihiko Kayaba comes in and tells the 10,000 that they are not able to leave the game until it is cleared.  This is all going great for the people in said game till, and I quote from our main protagonist, \"If I die in the game, I die in real life!\"  And the story ensues from there.  From the way the story is set up, great things are expected to happen as the first 3 episodes are gripping and exciting, brimming with pain and misery from being in a game.  That is, until the story decides to go into side stories for about 5-6 episodes.  In the later half in the show regarding a game called Alfiem Online, or ALO, well, yeah.  The arc itself is about fairies, which I'm personally fine with.  The execution and the premise of it was horrible in the least.  Let's just say the pacing isn't exactly THE best thing to come out of SAO.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: First up, is Kazuto Kirigaya, or Kirito, as his username entails.  As a shut-in who focuses his time mainly on playing games, (sounds familiar, eh?) Kazuto doesn't show much interaction in the beginning of the show since he is a solo player and a loner.  It isn't until a tragic accident in episode 3, that changes Kazuto forever, urging him to finish the game as soon as possible.  Beyond that, well, nothing else happens.  If I was to explain him in the later episodes, I would phrase it as an overpowered player who really could care less about anything other then his girlfriend.  Yeah.  Next, Asuna Yuuki.  As the main female protagonist, she is shown at the beginning to be a strongheaded and focused player who ends up becoming a powerful player thanks to Kazuto's advice.  Although, as the series progresses, the badass attitude that she has early on, develops into well, a needy girl who needs her boyfriend to live.  Then we have the rest of the \"main\" cast such as Kazuto's \"sister\" Suguha, the loli Ayano (Silica), the blacksmith Rika, (lisbeth), the comic relief Ryotaro (Klein), the AI child Yui, and the awesome mace wielder, Agil.  Beyond that, we have a whole cast of side characters that get about 20 minutes at most of screen time which have no worth in mentioning.  (Figure out the antagonists for yourselves.)\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and sound: Animation is a huge plus for this anime.  With extremely detailed characters and beautiful scenery that looked like it was painted by Shiina from Sakurasou, SAO has some of the best animation quality to ever exist in anime ever.  Another great thing is the fluidity that existed within SAO's battle scenes.  From seeing the sword skills and the fantastic fight scenes, SAO truly has some of the best animation ever.  For music, SAO has great tracks as well.  Quoting only a few of the wonderful selections are \"Crossing field\", \"Innocence\", and my personal favorite, \"Swordland\".  The 3 of them serve there purposes as the openings and the battle music.  All of them sound great and the opening animations themselves look fantastic.  (Except for the dub's rendition of the opening.)  As of the making of this review, SAO has crossed over into english and the dub is well, adequate.  While the majority of the voices do match very well with the characters they are put into, Aniplex really screwed up on a select few.  The most prominent one is Asuna.  To me, Asuna's voice in the dub sounds like a 9 year old and it irritates me how she sounds really, really whiny.  I sincerely wished they recasted her.  However, the voice actors do portray emotions when they speak in certain scenes, and that's commendable considering that many dubs have fallen quite flat.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal enjoyment: Regardless of how much I butchered this show to its very core, SAO to me, was enjoyable to watch.  If there are any MMORPG players out there, I would highly recommend this, seeing as how the anime is basically based in an MMORPG world.  Though the plot was complete crap in development and pacing, there was something keeping me to watch more of it.  Like seriously, I couldn't stop watching this.  Because of that, I'm in the half-n-half camp where I like SAO, but it could be better.  With all the potential that it had in the first 3 episodes, it's a shame how badly executed it was later in the episodes.  If I was to change this show, I would say to completely get rid of the whole second arc and focus solely on the first arc for 2 reasons.  First, it's called SAO, not ALO.  So getting rid of the second arc would make a lot of sense due to the anime's namesake.  Second, is character development.  Because there is a 2 year gap between the first half and the second half in the first arc, expanding the first arc to 25 episodes rather then 15 would make so much more room for character development.  Kazuto and Asuna's relationship was very rushed, and the expanded amount of time could make their relationship more meaningful then it was.  Also, because SAO's concept was so much better then ALO's.  So, if you are an MMORPG player, this is an anime for you!  \\n\\n\r\nLittle note: Just because my profile pic is Kazuto, does not mean that SAO is the best thing ever.  I simply loved the character design.  Hell, I even based my own character off of him.",

            "content": "This is a a rewriting of my first review since I was ranting a lot in that, so this time I wil try not to rant and will use the usual swear words like fuck cause I used the n-word before, anyway, here we go ;_;\r\n\"A person is very strong when he seeks to protect something. I\u2019ll expect a good fight.\"\r\nI feel sorry for people like me who somehow watched all of this, I think you'll know why. So SAO 2 is gonna be finishing up soon, so you know what that means, we gotta review the first season *sighs* welp lets get this overwith. The thought of this makes me wanna barf. The story fails so many basic things. The charcters could be good but just get ignored like they were nothing. The music and animation are pretty solid but that dosen't make up for anything. And enjoyment comes from the mindless action and thats really it. A-1, are you even trying with this show?\\n\\n\r\nStory and characters: 2/10\\n\r\nNo seriously A-1, like seriously. So this is set in the near future were humanity have now accomplished Virtual Reality MMOs (VRMMOs for short) so everything is going well until, a game called Sword art Online (hence name of the show) is released. So as it gets launched everything goes fine until people realize, there's no logout button. Then it turns out the only way to get out is to complete all 100 floors, and there's a twist, if you die, you die for realsies. OH PAPER SHEETS! So this would probably be some Fantasy Action right? Well sadly, this also falls into the genres of Romance and harem.... so answered yet A-1? The bad thing is this fails so badly in basic things cause of, the MC. lets go on to him.\\n\\n\r\nKirito, so Kirito is the MC here and well, he really boring and bland. Even the stuff he says is bland. But somehow when he meets female characters (hence harem) they somehow fall in love with him... Either he's unbelievebly sexy and has a huge D or just anime logic. But really this is lazy, have a reason for why these people fall in love with him? Now male characters you ask, well the good thing is they don't fall for his spell, so thats all good.\\n\\n\r\nNext, another thing about the MC is that the story just focuses on him when in reality he just sucks. When we get introduced to new characters, they get ignored later on until some specific serious thing happens to Kirito. This is another sign of laziness, cause this show dosen't even try on developements.\\n\\n\r\nBut, then we have Asuna, when first introduced she's this shy but brave woman who you really like, she knows whats she's doing and is really likable. Then, she meets Kirito -_- this is where she becomes helpless. She goes from Joan of Arc to some generic anime female, she becomes this weaker version of who she once was and it feels like her soul belongs to Kirito and something. Please don't get me started on the fanart and chapter 16.5, like don't bother.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nThe art is pretty nice here, I like it, some really good looking visuals. But this dosen't make up for its laziness of characters. Some scenes the animation may be a little sloppy but they tried.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nThe music is not bad, some good tunes and some good OPs but meh EDs. It has some memroble tunes but overall good.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10\\n\r\nSo, boring dialouge, convinient ass things, plot holes, no charcter developements, pathetic writing. The only pro would be the action which is actually enjoyable to watch other than that, it dosen't even try.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2/10\\n\r\nThis is a poor excuse for a plot and characters, I don't know how this even got mainstream? The ending is meh, not much happens and really is there as a Happily ever after vibe. Overall, stay away from this, it dosen't even try.\\n\\n\r\nRating: Shit would taste better than this.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Oi\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\r\nYou know, ever since starting this in 2011, I always keep an open mind when reviewing most anime out there as most people tend to be too dismissive and ranty when it comes to new titles and often say the words, \u201cAnime is DEAD!!\u201d whenever a bad show (or what people perceive as \u2018bad\u2019) appears in the broadcast wavelengths and this particular show already has a history of that already in the span of two years and has already gotten its fans and its critics. (And note, I said critics, not haters because\u2026..well, we\u2019ll get to that later).\r\nSword Art Online (SAO) is a Virtual RealityMassively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (VRMMORPG), released in 2022. With the Nerve Gear, a virtual reality helmet that stimulates the user's five senses via their brain, players can experience and control their in-game characters with their minds.\\n\r\nOn November 6, 2022, the players log in for the first time, and later discover that they are unable to log out. They are then informed by Akihiko Kayaba, SAO's creator, that if they wish to be free, they must reach the 100th floor of the game's tower and defeat the final boss. However, if their avatars die in-game, their bodies will also die in the real world. One of these players is Kazuto \"Kirito\" Kirigaya, a skilled player who is determined to beat the game. As the game progresses for two years, Kirito eventually befriends a female player named Asuna with whom he ultimately falls in love. After the duo discover the identity of Kayaba's avatar Heathcliff in SAO, they confront and destroy him, freeing themselves and the other players from the game.\\n\\n\r\nNow, with a premise like that, it\u2019s something that could be promising and worth to be a watch but unfortunately, that\u2019s only the first episode and maybe the second because as the rest went back, the quality of it got lower and lower as the show went and this is something I watched twice. First time during the simulcast period and second time around the Toonami run with the English dub and I didn\u2019t hate it as much at the first time but the second time viewing it, I really didn\u2019t like what I saw (and no, it\u2019s not because of the English dub).\\n\\n\r\nThe show is split into two arcs: The Aincrad Arc and the Fairy Dance Arc. For the Aincrad Arc, I did think that arc was alright at first, but most of the time, I was bored to tears and the pacing of it is way too fast and clumsy. I know some people complain about slow pacing of anime in the past but at least they try to get you immersed into the storyline. They jumped forward to the story too much, leaving out some details that could be important to the story but instead, it\u2019s left out for the romance side story, which really wasn\u2019t that great in the first place. The Fairy Dance Arc was a completely unnecessary arc as forced melodrama took over with either a love triangle that shouldn\u2019t have happened nor did it need to exist and a new game, ALfheim Online, was made even though after the disaster of SAO, you think you would\u2019ve stopped there but nope. The bad quality of the writing shows during this arc, even though the writing for the first one was just uninteresting. It felt like they needed to just do shit for the sake of doing it with no plausible explanation and as far as people saying it was the smartest anime at the time, you got to be kidding me. There is nothing smart or deep about this series and while that might not be a bad thing, it\u2019s not entertaining either and if you can\u2019t be both of those, then you failed to be a good show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are even worse as most of them don\u2019t really seem that memorable or inspirational. They are quite forgettable. Take the main character, Kazuto Kirigaya, who is the most powerful character in the show because of\u2026\u2026..well, fuck if I know. Now I said one time that Kirito wasn\u2019t the perfect character and I may have said that wrongly because it is described as being perfect, perhaps too perfect and with him being the strongest player (or beater) in the game, I have no concern to worry about him. He\u2019s just a generic badass wannabe. We know he can defeat whoever challenges him and that just sucks out the tension of it. \\n\\n\r\nKirito is a wish-fulfillment character that guys desperately want to be. And as for Asuna, she could\u2019ve been an alright character and she was for a bit but most of the time, she had some of that tsundere character traits that I really hate but the biggest downfall for her is when her development shrivels down and that confidence in her is just poof, gone and for their romance, it really wasn\u2019t that inspiring as most fans think it is because no relationship like that would ever go like that within the span of the first arc, which I would blame the time skips for and the fact that the second arc shouldn\u2019t have been made at all. The other characters in there doesn\u2019t seem that important at all because the show doesn\u2019t give them that much face time except for either one or two episodes. Klein and Agil were good characters, I give them that but the girls (Yui, Silica, Lisbeth, Sachi, Leafa) all seem like they are part of Kirito\u2019s growing harem of girls that fawn over him, even an AI character that supposed to be Kirito and Asuna\u2019s \u201cdaughter\u201d and also his sister\u2026..no, wait, his cousin (as in that love triangle that was pointless to begin with). The villains of the show Akihiko Kayaba and Nobuyuki Sug\u014d (Oberon the Fairy King) have the worst motivations for doing what they did, especially the former whose reason for doing this wasn\u2019t even explained and the latter\u2019s purpose may have some motivation but a piss-poor motivation to do it.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation by A-1 Pictures (who made Blue Exorcist, Magi, Fairy Tail, & Anohana) was perceived as stellar to most people and while it looks look visually stunning, it\u2019s not all amazing as some make it out to be. It\u2019s not awful but nothing that I haven\u2019t saw before and as far as some of the action scenes go, they aren\u2019t actually that well-animated.  It has pretty artwork and the character designs does appeal to the standard otaku, which is why they might love the show in first place.\\n\\n\r\nMusic-wise, I love Yuki Kajiura and her music but this score is just about average and the same can be said about the opening and ending themes of the show (and I mean, all of them). \u201cCrossing Field\u201d doesn\u2019t really stand out as one of the best themes in an anime and especially from the singer LiSA. I still say to this very day that \u201cOath Sign\u201d is more of an inspiring theme song than this. \\n\\n\r\nAnd now for the dub, which is also average. Yep, in 2013 where Bang Zoom Entertainment proves their dubs are getting better in quality (Fate/Zero, Blue Exorcist, Accel World) than most of what FUNimation or Sentai Filmworks pumps out weekly or monthly, this isn\u2019t their brightest one but it isn\u2019t that horrible of one either. Bryce Papenbrook as Kirito did felt uninspired although in his defense, I think it matches the character rightfully. Cherami Leigh does alright in her starring debut in a LA dub as Asuna. I would say that Todd Haberkorn being one of the villains is expanding his range as a VA but I\u2019ve seen it done before and it felt like how Johnny Yong Bosch was in Fate/Zero (Ok, I\u2019ve been mentioning that show here lately) In short, I do like most of the dub cast in here (like Cassandra Lee Morris, Christine Marie Cabanos, Patrick Seitz aka one of the few guys I don\u2019t mind playing a black man because dude can do that, Kirk Thornton), but I felt they were underutilized.\\n\\n\r\nFINAL VERDICT: OK, there\u2019s no doubt about it. This is just a failure of a show, not a complete failure but damn, this was disappointing. I blame the hype of this as people making it out to be one of the best shows in 2012 when it\u2019s really the most popular title of that year and I\u2019ll say this as many people did, \u201cJust because it\u2019s popular, doesn\u2019t guarantee that it\u2019s any good.\u201d The writing is abysmal, the characters are bland and forgetful. The only praise I get from it was the artwork and the music was just average and I thought .hack/sign was a bore to get through but at least that show had some merits. And I highly say I would NOT recommend this title to many of you unless you need to see it for yourself to show how it is. This is purely one of the many examples of how NOT to write an anime.\\n",

            "content": "SAO is about as generic as an anime can get. I was really excited to see a .HACK styled anime outside of the franchise; expecting some new inputs from an outside perspective. I am sadly disappointed by SAO, it started off like an even darker .HACK//SIGN and quickly turned into light-hearted romance where they insert as many anime clich\u00e9s as humanly possible. Without further ado let's get into it.\r\nSTORY:\r\nSAO does not have a well developed story, and it is not the kind of anime that can survive on near episodic content and filler. Continuity and consequence are pretty much ignored because of the way timejumps around \"someone dies, oh well they might as well have never existed as of the next episode\" and \"I'm forced into a situation I don't want to be in, good thing time can jump forward and just give a vague reason why this is no longer the case.\" That aside SAO's biggest problem in my opinion would be that the story seems like it was written by several people and none of them talked to each other. The story starts off as a bit of a dark action story but you can tell by the way the plot is set-up (climb to the top of the tower) that it will become an action-adventure story and it does, very briefly, before it transcends into what every person watching an anime based in an action-MMO wants: A slice of life romance, because that's what we all wanted... right? Although there is a clear goal to the series, there does not appear to be much in the way of direction, at least that we actually get to see. Other than the occasional downing of a boss we mainly get to see the lives of Kirito and Asuna as they fall in love and eat sandwiches. The lack of an antagonist is annoying, even more-so because it's somewhat predictable as to what is going to happen. (NOTE: THE FOLLOWING IS SPECULATION but it's probably true) the game creator is an obvious choice but since there'd be no way to defeat him outside of finishing the game and getting him in person, the creator is likely playing the game and just for the M Night Shamalan twist he is probably a character we've already met disguised as a good guy (I'm confident in all of that but the last bit but that is basically an example of how generic this is.) Which brings us to characters.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: \\n\r\nThey're bad, they're soo soo bad. I don't mind an OP character, in fact I prefer them, I don't want to watch 100 different anime all about some guy who is kind of emo and not very good at anything and then watch him grow and overcome his hardships to finally become a pokemon master, or whatever. I love watching badass main characters just be amazing and overcome incredibly difficult challenges in a creative way instead of struggling through it over 5 episodes. I don't mind that Kirito is strong, I'm not a big fan of the super secret trump card, especially when it's as lame as his is (to be honest pretty bad game design that his secret ability wasn't available to everyone.) Kirito starts off as a smart calculated loner (overdone but hey at leasts he's not emo) he quickly turns emo (damn!) and drops about 10-20 points in IQ, now at this point in watching he becomes a happy-go-lucky love bird with a sense of justice also an optimist. Next up is Asuna, a shy antisocial girl who has never played an MMO also pretty and smart. Jump to the future, she's one of the most powerful characters, talks to everyone, and is a high-ranked outgoing member of a guild also a tsundere. Jump again to the lovey-dovey girl completely overshadowed by her boyfriend and is entirely too emotional and cooks of course. I'd talk about some of the side characters but they're pretty much all dead. Other than Klein and the girls who will likely make an appearance as love rivals because there isn't enough generic romance in the series, there aren't many returning characters so far.\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\\n\r\nIt's great, their is a great use of colours and even the UI looks sleek and nice. Backgrounds are drawn well and tend to reflect the mood very well. The animation for the action sequences is actually quite nice though the action is a bit sparse.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: \\n\\n\r\nI would not at all be surprised if someone told me this anime existed to show off the music, it's implemented quite well and overall there's a high quality pick. The voice acting is fairly good for most characters.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT AND OVERALL:\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't call it enjoyable, actually, I'd say you could basically just skip through the episode and watch about a total of 7-10 minutes and get the entire idea, there's a lot of unnecessary dialogue and if you don't care for the romance then there's a lot of nothing going on for the most part. Basically this anime is just teenagers playing house, eating sandwiches, having the occasional battle, and faffing about. The unfortunate part is that the action bits are done really well for the most part.",

            "content": "Three. I\u2019ve watched this show three times. Two. I\u2019ve written two reviews for this show but didn\u2019t post them because I didn\u2019t like them. One. This show deserves the one review it has coming to it, to cover the good and bad beyond the visuals and music. After watching this show thrice, can I truly say what makes this show tick?\r\nGod help me, let\u2019s begin. Let\u2019s look at Sword Art Online.\r\nThe story begins with the launch day of a virtual reality online game called Sword Art Online. But as the day draws to a close, the players find that they can\u2019t log out. Their mindsare trapped in the game, and the only means of escape is to clear all 100 floors of Castle Aincrad where the game takes place. And death in the game means death in real life. From here on, it\u2019s worth noting that the concept of a \u201cdeath video game\u201d is tossed in the sense that there are gameplay mistakes that might be better suited to an alternate world fantasy show.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, the show mostly IS an alternate world fantasy show. That doesn\u2019t entirely excuse the mistakes, but bringing focus to them would be missing the bigger picture. Mistakes are only bad when nothing distracts from them, and for the most part the show is able to distract from them through world building and immersion.\\n\\n\r\nIt achieves this world building by greeting viewers with believably strong visuals. It\u2019s not just how vibrant and fluid the visuals look, but the design choices to reflect practicality, to look less like a fantasy and more like something that could really happen. Save for one villain, the designs look at least well armored or fully clothed all over; it\u2019s easy to believe sword and shield users like Heathcliff can charge the frontlines, or why a speedy fighter like Asuna can dance around a fight. There are no skimpy outfits tanking hits or heavy suits zipping all over the place. It looks as practical as it is.\\n\\n\r\nThe setting itself is often as down to Earth as a fantasy can get. The 18th century flavor to most of the towns and the undeveloped locales such as the lakeside forest don\u2019t serve to remind the viewer the show is a fantasy, but as a glimpse into the past. It\u2019s a fantasy with the illusion of reality, and avoids being too fantastic to be believed. That is, except for the dungeons and monsters. More mundane creatures tend to lurk the normal fields, with the lizardmen, ogres, and reapers showing up in more and more dungeons that remind viewers this show is indeed a fantasy. A fantasy the players want to wake up from.\\n\\n\r\nAll the players, the characters, are simple but personable. I couldn\u2019t describe the well-meaning but perverted Klein or feisty Lizbeth beyond just that, but taken together all the characters give the setting a personality to match how down to Earth it is. It\u2019s simple, but lively. The characters themselves are unexplored, but their stories come to life by expanding on everything the setting has to offer. From the carelessness of low level players in a treasure chest room to a journey for a rare mineral to craft the finest sword, the setting gives action to the characters, and the characters give life to the setting.\\n\\n\r\nThere are two certain characters who form the crux of the story, where the viewers see most of the action from. They are Kirito and Asuna, two of the strongest players in the game, but still only a slip away from death via sleep PK, defending a weaker player, or tricked into a bad state. Like the side characters, they\u2019re simple, but the draw here is a couple on equal ground. Their behavior behind closed doors is charming if cheesy, but as they defend and rescue each other from fights, it\u2019s hard not to stare in awe at them as they fight.\\n\\n\r\nThe fights themselves are loud, with music going with it that ranges from the energetic and nearly hopeful to the ominous and almost hopeless. But while the battle music makes fights entertaining, it\u2019s eclipsed by the calm and unnoticeable. The town music gives a sense that it\u2019s just another ordinary day in this fantasy world, while other pieces go from nostalgic to ambient. The ambient tracks are used especially well during moments of silence where the dialog becomes the focus. This helps to bring life to the show where it is uneventful, and uneventfulness does happen often.\\n\\n\r\nThis is because while the show starts as an action fantasy, it turns into a slice of (fantasy) life. As the days trapped in the game turn to months, more and more players stop trying to clear the game for fear of death, and yet with so few people trying to clear the game the odds of winning begin to slim. It\u2019s this strong subtext of safety VS sacrifice that dampens a holiday celebration or someone going fishing, and makes the move into calmer episodes believable. But whether the show is calm or intense, there are often small reminders that the setting isn\u2019t real beyond some of the monsters and dungeons.\\n\\n\r\nSometimes a relationship from real life will change in this virtual reality, one character will remind another character of a sister they have in real life, and another character still may scoff at the idea of players really dying if killed in the game. It\u2019s reminders like these that always give the show a sense of weight, to pull viewers\u2014and the players\u2014out of any good feelings that might have been starting to build for the game, where what they might cherish is only a dream. For better or worse, the show is immersive, but not as immersive as it could be with the way the show is paced.\\n\\n\r\nOften times the show will have time skips between episodes, which hurts the immersion like a level select cheat in video games; the more levels one skips, the more disjointed the game feels. From a storytelling standpoint, each time skip goes to something important or at least different from the hours a character might have spent going from level 40 to level 75. And yet, the time skips are still often misused. Some episodes would have been better showing more of the events leading up to it, another episode actually seems to forget the plot point it started with entirely, and Kirito and Asuna\u2019s relationship can feel rushed.\\n\\n\r\nWith the immersion being hurt, the mistakes begin to show. So the show is far from perfect. The characters are simple and the pacing and mistakes make the show stumble. But though it trips, it keeps going forward. The world building covers for the characters, and the characters give life to this setting where the show might have skipped over. The setting and characters are fairly down to Earth, where the strength of this fantasy is an illusion of reality. Glued together by strong visuals and music, and the show is very much worth watching.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, this is only talking about the first 14 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nEpisodes 15 to 25 is where Sword Art Online changes a lot for the worse. It brings in a new character who\u2019s as personable and simple as any character from the show\u2019s first half. Now, the show\u2019s first half could get away with its simple characters because it had so many and most were only around for one or two episodes at most. They left before wearing out their welcome, but not in the case of this new character. Much of the show focuses on this new character\u2019s feelings for Kirito, but with almost no other characters to cover for her simplicity, she can\u2019t even give the image of being a compelling character.\\n\\n\r\nBut while this new character is just decent, Kirito goes from decent to offensive with a lack of sincerity on his character. At the start of the show\u2019s second half, it\u2019s hard not to feel sorry for him as a certain plot point becomes his driving motivation. And yet, for much of the show\u2019s second half, he has almost no sense of urgency despite how devastated he initially is, until the plot demands it. There is actually a scene where he says he\u2019ll get revenge on the villain, only for another character to remind him of his actual reason for fighting, to where Kirito says \u201coh, right\u201d as if he were running an errand. I\u2019m not joking.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s easy to get why the show becomes less action heavy in the first half, but Kirito\u2019s lack of sincerity in the show\u2019s second half is baffling. As for Asuna, she doesn\u2019t degrade as a character, though the story\u2019s treatment of her goes down. Now, I don\u2019t have a problem with showing a strong character as vulnerable, changing someone\u2019s role in the story, or what have you, but in the show\u2019s second half the writers have done everything in their power to outright disrespect her image from the show\u2019s first half. There are more tasteful ways to show weakness than softcore porn.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters are even worse. Most of them are shoved to appear all at once in one or two episodes, with their roles in the story being nothing more than to serve as fight fodder or to give info dumps about the setting. There\u2019s no time for them to give the world a personality, they have no personality to start with, and the world itself has almost no immersion with so many of its aspects being crammed. Of course, the show\u2019s second half is a more personal tale about Kirito and the new character, but only the new character is worth something since Kirito is insincere.\\n\\n\r\nBut Sword Art Online isn\u2019t a personal tale. Though the show\u2019s first half does focus on Kirito and Asuna, it\u2019s more about what they learn from the world and other characters around them than their own thoughts. The show\u2019s first half has simple characters, but they don\u2019t overstay their welcome. Though the show\u2019s pacing hurts it, it makes up for it with world building that can make these personable but simple characters something more. The show\u2019s second half has none of this, and to make it a personal tale when it worked much better as a grand story becomes its downfall.\\n\\n\r\nWith the world building gone, the mistakes really surface and soon the show has more questions than answers. Conflicts between player factions amount to nothing, fight scenes are bland when thinking about their new powers, and the over the top villain is more annoying than threatening. Except for Kirito, Asuna, and the new character, the show does away with its down to Earth characters and setting, further ruining the immersion as it hammers the viewers head with the message that this is a fantasy. This aesthetic change would have worked if the setting and characters were at least decently fleshed out, but they aren\u2019t.\\n\\n\r\nSo why couldn\u2019t the show stop at episode 14? The show\u2019s first half is far from perfect, but the love and energy put into it really shows. But the show\u2019s second half is a cash-in focused on the wrong thing and somehow made that thing worse. In a way, the launch day of Sword Art Online is much like watching this show; everyone is immersed by it, but by the time the evening hours come along, everyone regrets ever starting this game. The good news is the viewers can log out, and I suggest doing so after the show\u2019s first half. But if I\u2019m saying that, then I question if Sword Art Online is worth logging into.",

However, if they die in the game, they die in real life too.\" One of the worst lies in anime history. This anime is like an april fool's joke. This is the anime they should make criminals watch in interrogations.\r\nStory:\r\nThis is the cruelest joke any anime producer could pull off. The main character, [insert your name here] , is immune to this \"die in game, die in real life\" concept, even surviving being killed in the game. The storyline his infested with fillers, ecchi, and more.The storyline also has tons of time skips. \"But what about the 100 bosses?\" The final boss decides to make Kirito an offer. Kill him, and he let's everone free. Guess what? The final boss gets defeated! Surprise! This storyline is a trainwreck, adding pointless characters, ecchi, and romance in the series. Then again, the romance and ecchi are for the pervy teens and otakus. Subtracting the fillers and pointless episodes, this anime only has about 6 episodes that are relevant to the storyline. SIX.  I'm not going to even mention the second arc, adding more pointless crap like incest, and downright removing the concept. The storyline proves how rushed this anime really was.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nKirito, aka [insert your name.]:\\n\\n\r\nThis guy is invincible! He can't be touched, and he gets any girl he sees. He makes the perfect self insert character.!\\n\\n\r\nAsuna: This girl was a boss. However, she went from being a boss, to a cheap tsundere, and eventually, to a straight moe. She is very annoying.\\n\\n\r\nAny other character: They weren't memorable. I don't even remember their names.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and sound:\\n\\n\r\nI didn't mind the animation or soundtrack. They were awesome as a matter of fact, but they were made crap because of this crappy anime. The battles were very rushed however.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I didn't enjoy this to the least. I saw my life fly away from me after finishing this series. This anime was a joke, a horrifying joke that steals away your time from your life. A troll created this and thought it would be a good joke to play. It wasn't even funny.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nThis crap had a ton of fillers, girls, pointless characters, and time skips that'll make you cry. Take my advice, and stay away. You'll be happy you did.\\n\\n",

Please do not try to haunt and kill me if I insult \"the best anime evaaa\".\r\nStory: 3(poor)\r\nFirst all all let me get one thing straight, as an mmorpg player myself I was really looking forward to seeing this anime as it was two of my favourite things mixed together and I thought that this was awesome.So maybe I went into the anime with my expectations set way too high, but then again itis done by A-1 Pictures, which is the studio that made AnoHana, which I really liked. That aside lets continue with my 'amazing' opinion on this piece of poop. \\n\r\nFor the first 3-5 episodes everything was going great. There was so much potential for this anime to be one of my all-time favourites, but as the story progressed the chance of that happening kept getting lower and lower. First of all I would like to know whether the god of time skips had something to do with the show, because I'm quite sure he did. Like how exactly can you have about 5 out of a 100 supposed boss battles showed. Also why the hell would the last boss be weaker than any of the pervious ones. Moreover the show ignores its premise and genre, and goes on to be a 'romantical comedy' for more than 3/4 of the show.\\n\r\nWhich really bugged me.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6 (fair)\\n\r\nNow, the art for the anime was quite amazing to be honest, but unfortunately I feel like the creators put more effort into the boob-bouncing scenes, rather than the action scenes, which is a shame.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7 (good)\\n\r\nNow that is a real waste, because the OST is done by Yuki Kajura, who also did the soundtrack to Fate/Zero, which is my favourite anime.. Not only that but the opening and ending themes (with the exception of one) are similarly done by the same artists who did the Fate/Zero ones which made me really angry as to why the Japanese are wasting such great songs for such a god awful anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 2 (dreadful )\\n\r\nOh gawd, where do I even start.\\n\r\nFirst of all the main character is as chiched and overpowered a character could possibly get. Such a shame his birthday is the same as mine...\\n\r\nThe main female lead changes personality from the baddas mysterious girl she's first presented as to a bitchy damsel in disstress that needs to be protected by the main character as every other heorine out there\\n\r\nThe rest of the harem bait don't even deserve an introduction \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2 (dreadful)\\n\r\nWith all that in mind I didnt really enjoy the anime and finished it only to be able to get a \" I survived\" badge \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3 (poor)\\n\r\nOverall this anime is full of crap and it is highly overrated.. despite the very few good things about it I would reccomend you not to watch it if you want your hair on your head and not in your hands as its been pulled out by yourself.\\n\\n\r\nP.S. I shall now proceed to find a good hiding spot before I get killed by all the die-hard fanboys of the show.\\n\\n",

            "content": "First, let me state that I watched Sword Art Online for the first time 2 years ago and was one of the fangirls who rated it as a 10. After re-watching it with a critical mindset, I will admit how stupid it was of me to blindly overrate this show back then. SAO is nowhere near as good as it portrays to be, and it\u2019s easy to spot with open eyes.\r\nThe idea itself is good. Gamers trapped in a virtual game and cannot escape until someone defeats all 100 levels that increase in difficulty? Okay, sounds good. If you die in the game, you diefor real? Sounds even better. Want to throw in a little romance? Go right ahead. Create an overpowered male protagonist and throw countless deus ex machina to make him appear as the ultimate hero with forced happy endings? You just ruined my appetite.\\n\\n\r\nSAO started off well with the introduction of the MCs and a little gameplay to familiarize the viewer with the main objective. There are a couple of fillers that step away from the objective to give side characters their spotlight. It\u2019s not completely irrelevant, because you learn more about the rules of SAO that come in handy later on.\\n\\n\r\nIf a show has a survival game, there\u2019s nothing wrong with heroic protagonists (Kirito and Asuna in SAO) as long as it's executed properly. Although it starts off well, SAO fails by throwing illogical excuses to make Kirito appear more heroic than he actually is. Regardless of being a beta tester, there are several cases where he receives special treatment for no reason. A prime example is the addition of a moe deus ex machina character (Yui), who is nothing but a cheat code for Kirito and Asuna to give them an advantage over the other players. Yui is just there to answer questions, give tips, and share info that is not revealed to other gamers. SAO has a bad habit of forcing happy endings with the most ridiculous outcomes, leaving several plotholes. This develops Kirito into an obvious Gary Stu with him unexpectedly doing amazing things every single time he reaches a dead end. There are no logical explanations for his skills and talents that appear out of nowhere. It just happens, along with the first arc\u2019s irrational ending. \\n\\n\r\nThe second part was worse, and I\u2019m not referring to the incest that takes place. Everything restarts with a new game, new rules, new settings, and new characters. Again, the deus ex machina is all over the place, and Kirito would get nowhere without them. There are love triangles involved, and SAO explores one side and leaves the other side unfinished. It\u2019s difficult also to actually feel for the characters when SAO doesn\u2019t give any logical reasons why the person is in love. Asuna reduces from her role as a powerful fighter to a damsel-in-distress. It takes a huge leap by creating this uncomfortable atmosphere, sexualizing the show with these rape scenes, including tentacle rape. \\n\\n\r\nThe romance between Kirito and Asuna was not a bad idea. It was good considering the pacing within two years, so it never led to a clich\u00e9 and rushed pacing with them immediately falling for each other. Besides Yui, who makes Kirito and Asuna\u2019s story seem like the ultimate romance, things blow way out of proportion when SAO leads into a harem. \\n\\n\r\nThe harem aspect of SAO downgrades the characters significantly, but what can you expect when you have an abundance of female characters and an undefeatable hero? It is hardly ever a moment when you find Kirito spending less than a day with another female without her falling for him, and it throws fanservice in your face every time. Then comes the female characters with their dense moments. All of the scenes with Asuna and other females, who intentionally put themselves in danger, appears constantly as an excuse to bring Kirito into the spotlight as the guy who saves the day. If the girls had a motive or logical reasons for making rash decisions, I would excuse that. But since they just talk badass for an instant and step aside for Kirito to finish what they started, it makes the show unattractive.\\n\\n\r\nThere are honestly not any memorable characters in SAO. Kirito and Asuna are super attractive. SAO makes it obvious that they\u2019re every woman/man\u2019s wet dream, and nearly everyone envies them and wants to be like them. However, neither one of them have any special traits. Since they\u2019re your typical Gary Stu and Mary Sue characters, there\u2019s no sense for character development. The villains are not evil at all. They\u2019re both pathetic and laughable, and the 2nd villain is more comical than the first one. Each one of them is indecisive, have no logical motive for their wrongdoings, and lack the common knowledge fit for any evildoer. Although most of the female side characters were just there to fall in love in Kirito, some of the serious ones acted realistically in terms of heartbreak. The gamers varied from good guys and bad guys, so it wasn't completely boring with everyone having their own goals.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and OST are good for the most part. The settings and background design were beautiful, and it realistically portrayed the sunsets with shadows and appropriate color contrasts. The gameplay suited the atmosphere, especially when a character died. The character design and outfits were good. One noticeable problem was how the characters did not suit a situation. For example, two characters are in the same drastic situation, but only one character looks frail and unhealthy while the other looks perfectly normal as if nothing happened.\\n\\n\r\nNo complaints with the two OPs and EDs. Personally, I liked the ones from the first arc better. The seiyuu were good also, and most of them reacted well emotionally. The background music fitted the virtual world and different situations. It was playful during the laidback scenes and hardcore during the fight scenes. There were a few times when, immediately after a drastic scene, the music becomes cheerful and made me question whether I\u2019m supposed to take a scene seriously or not.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it is not hard to notice the bad writing of SAO. The idea was good, but the execution was poor. I had high hopes for it in the beginning, thinking \u201cHow can someone possibly dislike this?\u201d Then everything went downhill in a hurry. It led to plotholes. The MCs are basically a lie, because they needed help from deus ex machina and never actually worked for their success. The amazing animation and OST were the best parts, but it cannot make up for SAO\u2019s failure with the story and its characters. Let\u2019s hope SAO II is a bit more decent.",

            "content": "I wonder if it's possible to write an uncontroversial review on this anime. Let me take a crack at it. \r\n*****\r\nYou know, SAO is not the worst thing the anime industry has ever churned out, despite what people out there say. Is it bad? Sure. The characters suck and the plot is full of conveniences and the pacing is pretty crappy and there is no thematic value and blah blah blah. \r\nSAO is such an easy target. It's not just because it's a bad anime; it's because it's a bad anime with massive hype. Compounding matters is the perception that people have of SAO's fanbase- I mean, when terms like \"wish-fulfillment\" get thrown around on a near-constant basis, it's hard to avoid imagining thousands of lonely and immature otaku hovering behind their laptop screens, ready to jerk it as soon as Asuna appears with a sandwich for Kirito.\\n\\n\r\nIf we treat anime as a medium for storytelling, and if we then judge SAO on its storytelling ability, yeah, it sucks. It's not really possible to defend its narrative structure nor its execution. Kirito is one of the most painfully dull characters in existence. I figure that Asuna was only created because the author of the source LNs had a bet to see how quickly he could torpedo a character's development. They even managed to slip in some incest in there - oh, but wait, she's not *really* his sister, so clever. This anime is fraught with a litany of serious issues and it deserves to be called a bad anime.\\n\\n\r\nBut you know what? Despite all that, it's still not offensively atrocious. SAO has great production values, and the fights are well-animated. The setting is fleshed out just enough to qualify as immersive, and while the game mechanics are absurd and serve as little more than deus ex machina, a lack of fidelity towards real-life MMORPGs isn't the biggest crime in the world considering that some of the most highly regarded anime out there take massive liberties with their internal logic as well (looking at you, M- nah...probably not a good idea to name names). And, well, I managed to get a laugh out of all the ridiculous plot armor that Kirito stacks himself with, and Asuna's almost surreal transformation from badass heroine to helpless fap bait had me in stitches. So there's that, I guess.\\n\\n\r\nI think SAO gets way too much hate for what it really is. It's a bad anime that got too much hype, but it's really not the worst thing ever. There's much, much worse out there than this. SAO didn't give me a venereal disease, it didn't kill my brain cells (well maybe a few), it didn't make me want to stop watching anime forever, it didn't make me contemplate suicide, and it didn't make me want to write a hate review. It's just an unremarkably bad anime. That's all. 4/10.\\n",

            "content": "Now before I begin this review, let me just say that I have good reason to give this show a one out of ten. It's very rare that I give shows such a bad rating, but hear me out and you'll understand my points. \r\nNow that we have that taken care of, let's move on.\r\n\"Sword Art Online\" takes place in the distant future, where the video-game market has become huge thanks to new technology called, \"NerveGear\". It's a system that fully scans your nerves and all five of your senses and connects them into an online world where practically anything is possible.\r\nThe story focuses onthe release of the first MMORPG for the NerveGear system, \"Sword Art Online\". Kiriyaga Kazuto (Kirito) is one of the beta-testers for this game and was able to easily get his hands on one of the limited 10,000 copies sold in Japan. When all seems to be going smoothly, things take a \"deadly\" turn when the video-game's creator, Kayaba Akihiko, forces players to keep playing until someone manages to beat the game. In order to do so, players must defeat 100 \"bosses\"; each on it's own level in the game and each more powerful than the other. If players die in the game, or someone in the real world attempts to take off the NerveGear, the NerveGear's micro-wave safety system will turn off and it will fry their brain, killing them in real life. \\n\\n\r\nThe first three episodes were absolutely incredible! It completely draws you in to the story, the characters are all so diverse, and the incredible action sequences have you hanging on the edge of your seat! There is so much at stake, and everyone is sacrificing so much to ensure that the game will be beat and everyone gets out alive. The series also grows tense as trust between people grow thin, and players start getting killed by other players. \\n\\n\r\nEach of the characters was completely unique because they all had their own strengths and weaknesses, forcing everyone to work together in order to survive. One of the most notable side characters is Asuna, an attractive and shy girl who really knows how to wield a sword. She manages to help Kirito defeat the first boss as if they both did it before. I didn't have a doubt that she would be a very strong character that would help Kirito throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nI also absolutely loved the animation of the show and it's incredible soundtrack! It truly brought the show to life and made me want to hear the music over and over again.\\n\\n\r\nThe train started to move really fast, and everything was going fine. That is, until episode four. That's when the series completely \"jumped the shark\" and became what I hoped it would not become; a harem romance series with a worthless male protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nStarting at Episode 4, the series starts to skip a lot of levels, skipping out on a lot of the story and action. And it's starting at Episode 4 when it starts to slowly sink in that Kirito isn't all that much of a nice guy.\\n\\n\r\nKirito may be strong, but he only cares about himself and becoming the most powerful character in the game. He hides secrets from his allies which lead to their inevitable deaths, he puts the lives of strangers on the line just to get a more powerful sword, and often uses other people as a means to help him grind his way up the rankings. \\n\\n\r\nWhat makes this character even more despicable is how many girls are attracted to him and how he treats those girls.\\n\\n\r\nIt is a given fact that girls are attracted to strong, independent and cute guys, even if they are completely heartless. Yet once a new female character is introduced into the series, they are only shown for one episode then completely forgotten after the next episode. \\n\\n\r\nIn other words, not only are there far too many side-characters in this series, Kirito doesn't care about a single one of them. Not many people who watch this series notice this, though, and that's why this show is completely over-rated (because a good story doesn't really matter, right? As long as you got great animation, music and a lot of babes, right?)\\n\\n\r\nThis anime was definitely rushed. It could have gone on for much longer and included a lot more action sequences. Yet it's as if they cut out all the good parts and left you with what should have been the occasional romance episodes. \\n\\n\r\nTo put this into perspective, imagine cutting out all the action sequences and plot development sections in \"Fairy Tail\" or \"BLEACH\", and all you have is romance episode fillers. That's exactly what this series is.\\n\\n\r\nBut that's okay, at least we got Asuna to make the series worth watching, right? \\n\\n\r\nWRONG! \\n\\n\r\nBy the time the series ends, Asuna goes from being a strong and independent heroin to a damsel-in-distress who can do nothing without Kirito around. The writers completely ruined Asuna's character just to please the large crowd of fanboys, and that's unacceptable! \\n\\n\r\nAnd by then end of the series, nothing is explained. \\n\\n\r\nThere is no motive to why the game creator trapped people inside SAO, or how Kirito managed to come back to life after he was killed for a short moment in time only to somehow kill the final boss (which was suppose to be immortal) with ONE STAB. \\n\\n\r\nI honestly thought that this series was going to be worth watching, yet I regrettably kept watching it hoping to find some good action or character development. Unfortunately, all I found were terrible romance fillers and even more useless side characters. \\n\\n\r\nAND THEN THERE'S THE SECOND HALF OF SAO, which is when \"Alfheim Online\" gets introduced. It's as if the writers made the second-half of the series just to please the fan-boys and further throw SAO's potential out the window. It really would have been best to have just stopped SAO as soon as the game was beat, yet they decided to keep the bandwagon going and make the second half. \\n\\n\r\nThis section of the anime is even hated by the most die-hard SAO fans for a reason; the suspense and action from the first part simply isn't there anymore. The second-half just throws cute girls in your face and the series becomes extremely awkward and annoying, especially once Kirito's sister gets introduced (and if you've watched enough anime, then you know where this is going). \\n\\n\r\nIf I were to compare this show to another television show, it would definitely be the series LOST. It started off with incredible potential, then it just went downhill and never came back up. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, \"Sword Art Online\" had incredible potential as an action series, and the first three episodes proved that. Yet it ended up to be another version of \"School Days\"; pathetic love story, hardly any plot, despicable lead and a lot of cute girls to keep the targeted audience interested.\\n\\n\r\nI honestly despise this anime with all my heart, despite what the large crowd of fan boys have to say. Not just because of the terrible character development and the worthless plot, but what this series could have become. It could have been an incredible action series if they did it right, but they flushed it's incredible potential down the toilet and replaced it with video-game boy fan service! \\n\\n\r\nThis is why I believe that Sword Art Online is not only one of the most over-rated anime's in existence, but one of the biggest wastes of incredible potential in history.\\n\\n\r\nTHE VERDICT:\\n\r\n+ Excellent Music/Action Sequences\\n\r\n+ Colorful Animation\\n\r\n- Worthless Plot\\n\r\n- Incredible Potential Wasted\\n\r\n- Terrible Character Development\\n\r\n- Despicable Lead\\n\r\n- Pointless Second Part (Alfheim Online)\\n\r\n- Harem Replaces Action\\n\r\n- Too Many Girls\\n\\n\r\nSCORE: 1/10\\n\\n\r\nDO NOT WATCH!",

            "content": "Watching Sword Art Online (SAO) is kind of like watching a baby bird learning how to fly. At first is stumbles a bit, but then gets the hang of it and takes off. However, once it's in the air, one of two things can happen: it's able to keep its strength and fly safely, or comes crashing down as its unable to hold its own. SAO, in my opinion, is like the latter of these two situations. After getting going a few episodes in, it got really good, then halfway through everything changed and it fell apart. From what I'm gathering, there appears to bea fairly large difference in opinion on the show itself, some love it and some hate it. Personally, I loved it but that's from a mostly enjoyment standpoint. When you look deeper into the show, the flaws are pretty obvious.\\n\\n\r\nSo, lets get on to the breakdown!\\n\\n\r\nStory - 4/10\\n\r\nI was very torn on how to rate the story of this show. The overall concept behind it, a virtual reality MMORPG was amazing to me. It's something I've thought about for years. However, it feels like something was lost when they translated this idea into a show. At first, things are too fast-paced, events move faster than I was comfortable with. But a few episodes in it was wonderful. The original action-based plan of the anime turned into a smooth more romance based one with action. The concept of losing your life in reality if you die in the game added a nice touch of suspense and drama to the whole story, though this only applied to the first half. There was a ten episode stretch where this show probably would have ranked a solid 8 or 9. Once the first arc ended, however, it just collapsed.\\n\\n\r\nThe second half of the season, which I honestly thought was a spin-off show at first, was a game changer and greatly took away from the quality of the show. If you're content with the story at the end of the first half, feel free to stop there. The aforementioned romance aspect took over and the show fell into the dark cast-iron mold of romance anime. Unnecessary aspects, such as ideas of incest, were also tossed in. The previous idea of dying in the game means death in life disappeared, removing a major piece of drama that could have been better utilized. The focus on romance took over the show and seems to have taken away from other story aspects - everything revolved around a single girl far more than what seemed appropriate for the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the story pans out to be about 4/10 (\"decent\") to me.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10/10\\n\r\nIn contrast to the violently fluctuating story quality, the visual aspect of SAO was incredible. As to be expected from an anime produced in 2012, the artwork is crisp, clean, and smooth. The character designs are highly appealing and the landscapes portrayed within the story are beautiful. Based in virtual reality, any scene was possible and the ones shown were highly detailed.\\n\\n\r\nSounds - 8/10\\n\r\nAudio was appropriate in most situations but nothing made it stand out from any other show. I did greatly enjoy both openings, Crossing Fields and Innocence, though.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 3/10\\n\r\nTo me, this was the most problematic part of SAO. Due to the pacing issues, some characters initially introduced magically vanished for many episodes while others disappeared shortly after being introduced. With the concept of losing your in place for the first arc, you would expect many emotional moments to be possible, and they were presented. However, failure to develop character backgrounds and personalities allowed emotional moments to fall through. I'm generally a very emotional person so I can be swayed by these scenes pretty easily, yet they only managed to make me tear where I imagined I would be fully crying.\\n\\n\r\nThe massive amount of characters thrown in with off-paced story-telling just leads to disaster. Even the two main characters suffered from stunted character development and left me quite disappointed. Additionally, the final villain just feels utterly out of place and awkward to me. All this said, there still manages to be \"enough\" character development to allow the show to work but still only gets a 3/10 (\"poor\")\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8/10\\n\r\nDespite the major issues in the story and sub-par character development, SAO manages to be a very entertaining show. At first, I somehow completely overlooked these flaws and fully enjoyed SAO at a basic level. It wasn't until I looked back on it that I realized how flawed it was. This is likely where the split in opinions stems from (once again, my opinion). If you're looking for something to just pass time and enjoy a show without any deep meanings, SAO fits the bill. However, if you're looking for a solid storyline with characters you can fall for, you probably want to look somewhere else.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 6.6/10 (6)\\n\r\nSAO was generally worth the watch and I did enjoy it. The artwork and sound are really holding this rating up (though I deducted a bit to give a 6). It's a show that had massive potential to be something amazing and fell flat on its face.\\n\\n\r\nI took a bit of thought and self-coaxing to actually criticize this show since I enjoyed it quite a bit. Hopefully the time I spent mulling this over and analyzing was worth and you all find this review useful. Thanks for reading!",

The storyline is quite fresh enough to grab my attention, but was poorly executed in the telling. The first episode fails miserably as it plainly introduces your typical boring protagonist: a lonely but talented gamer who has already played the beta version so has the upper hand in the game. Then another yet so boring character is introduced and the two gamers abruptly build a relationship that is short lasted. The characters seem like they have nopersonality and each one is no different from the rest basically each character has little to no dialogue. The point of the story is quickly announced by the game master as if the audience wasn't smart enough to figure it all out themselves. There isn't much action save for a couple of sword slashes that ends each fight. What burns the series even more is the lack of seriousness the characters seem to have. If death in the game will also result in death in reality, how come the gamers seem to have little to no care for their lives. When the first gamer is killed in a fight, everyone else seems to brush it off as if the gamer can be resurrected. How will the audience take the story seriously if the characters don't? Overall the story seems interesting enough for me to continue watching, just hope it improves.",

It has become quite trendy to jump on the hate train for this show however, so I will not dwell on the fact, that I simply have a passionate hate for this show, which is actually very rare for me. \r\nI am not even trying to be witty when saying, that this show misses pretty much every single aspect of telling a good or even mediocre story. What comes around at the end is simplyand nonchalantly put, a mess. Quite an intriguing mess to say the least but only for the fact, that this existing has rendered me speechless for quite some time now. \\n\r\nI won't cover basic review sections as extensively as other people did, because I would probably just parrot them. Animation is good, characters are unfocused blobs of fodder, main character is sued up to the point of ridiculousness, Asuna is the one even passable feature of the anime but is frequently shoved aside for Kirito to shine, ans so on basically. Do not pay as much attention to the score on this one, because it does not really reflect my enjoyment of the show. There is definitively no score for that. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I rather want to do however, is to try an understand how such a story could even be published to that extend and in such a state of unfocused and unpolished dribble. I have not figured this out even to this day and it still baffles me. What we first have to understand however is, that this is a story for 14-year-olds and below. In my opinion only those people could have a legitimate good time with it and show future potential of at least grasping the basics of a good story. Shounen is the most successful form of anime for a reason and those frequent tropes found in cette genre are there for a reason also. But still, shows like AoT, which I don't particularly like but could still see the appeal in, when threatened to get shot, at least have parts that redeem the show as something not being worth your interest rather than making you hate it. But there is no redeeming with SAO though. There is only agony and despair.\\n\r\nBut I don't want to insult anybody, despite what I said earlier. I do try very hard not to.  So let us rejoice in the fact that at least there are not more episodes coming and I don't want to hear about gun gale or whatever. He is a girl now and I don't care. \\n\r\nBut what makes this show so bad, so abysmal besides the obvious things like unnecessary timeskips, nonsensical charaktermoments and -motivations, literally cheating death because we'd like to keep out protagonist as flawless as possible?\\n\\n\r\nWell, in my opinion, what is far worse than any of these things is simply a lack of knowing even the basics of writing on the authors side. It is like Twilight all over again with these people. Aside from the baffling decisions that went into structuring the plot of Swort Art ans Alfheim Online, which are both almost equally bad in my opinion, this whole anime does not show even the slightest form of restraint. An overhyped, ultra badass, untouchable, walking deus ex machina of a protagonist is just the tip of the iceberg in this case. \\n\r\nIt is as if a kid without any kind of experience in the field of writing just walked into an office some day and somehow pressed everybody there into publishing his story. This makes not even passable first writing steps for a teenager. This seems almost like an insult to regular anime watchers, even consumers of shounen. I see Naruto writing itself deeper into a corner with every chapter, I see Bleach, refusing to bloody end but I have never seen such an embarrassment of a story. A community praising it as the second coming just adds further layers of salt to this already bad tasting meal. \\n\\n\r\nSo in conclusion, I would not recommend this show to anybody wanting at least a decent story. Something passable this is not. This is bad, appallingly bad, horrifyingly bad. So yeah, terrible show, awful in almost every regard, two years worth of semen, goodbye dear reader. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation was fairly nice though.",

            "content": "As an average traveller of the internet, I have been bombarded with millions of images regarding this anime, most of them filled with fanboys/girls saying how amazing Sword Art Online was, and how Asuna and Kirito were the most perfect couple in history. Curious, I decided to waste 20 minutes on watching the first episode, and I do admit, it looked really fantastic. It did of course, it doesn't anymore... \r\nStory: 3/10\r\nI don't really know how the creator of SAO handed his work to his editor. I figured he gave him a piece of paper with \"CLICHE!\" written on the middle, I might be wrong.\r\nAsgamers might be aware of, reaching the final boss of any MMO is a tough job, you need to train a lot, get the best equipment and skilled companions to aid you. Considering the fact that the very first boss of SAO (the weakest) was incredibly hard to handle, you could picture the amount of work our \"heroes\" will have to reach the end... pretty much none. Every episode occurs around 3 to 6 months after the previous one, in a desperate attempt to make the story move forward, I don't really see why, especially when the first episodes are nothing but useless fillers. I could write a novel with the flaws of this poorly made excuse for a story, but the other reviews do a good job on it.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nBeing of 2012, the animation is quite good, doing all those flashy sparkles and carefully designed background is not an easy task. But still, it's not really impressive, because most new animes have the same detail and definition, so it doesn't really stand out that much.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nLike the art, good. I can't really say much, because I rarely pay attention to background music, unless it is really amazing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10\\n\r\nKirito is a Mary Sue, that reason alone is more than enough to make me hate him. \"This boss is way too strong to defeat alone!\" Kirito does it. \"We need to work together to survive!\" Kirito survives alone. \"You can only wield one sword!\" Kirito gets two of them, and the list continues. Despite being a boring, anti-social, party-pooper son of a goat, he manages to make every single girl in the series to fall for him with no effort. The same goes for his experience and skill, you would expect the other characters to be also experienced, and they kinda are, but our \"hero\" is always stronger than everyone by 700 miles!\\n\r\nNow, the girl... Asuna started of as a completely mysterious person, some time-skips later, she was the strong, independent and ruthless captain of the strongest guild in the game! Some time-skips later, she was the very cute and innocent, dinner-preparing house wife... for our \"hero\" of course! I enjoy character development, but this young lady is doing it wrong... I can't really say many things, unlike the other girls, she is not very fond of Kirito, but like ALL the other girls, she falls for him and actually marries him. You don't see the love, you don't see the process, they spend some time together, next thing you see she's undressing for him... But don't panic, the secondary characters are actually kind of nice, you might like them, too bad 90% of the time is dedicated to the \"perfect couple\"...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4/10\\n\r\nOther than an occasional joke over here and there and the rare appearance of some secondary characters, there's not much to enjoy. You can still watch it for the pretty colors.\\n\\n\\n\r\nDisappointing, overrated, lame in general... Don't bother to watch this. The feeling is similar to \"Two girls One cup\". You start with something good, but in the end you get sh*t, except not literally this time...\\n\\n",

Anyway, I really think SAO is boring; yeah, the plot is okay, but they aren't doing a good job of executing it.

            "content": "Getting sucked into an Online MMORPG, having adventures with your life on the line each day, meeting new people and having an excuse to escape real life while building up a romance in it with a beautiful girl and being the strongest amongst everyone. Sounds like the wish every puberty ridden and anime-/videogames loving teenager has. It's no use explaining how Sword Art Online features all of this since 90% of you have already seen it anyway or at least have heard of it in one way or another. While most of the otaku-community probably wetted their beds in excitement for this show I gaveit a little while and quite a bit after it ended I decided to give it a try and be all neutral and leave aside all the prejudices I had from such an immensely popular anime being built up on all of this mentioned above. I'm not really a sucker for \"fan fiction\"-like premises like this one but to swim with the trend and to fill up my list of rather longer titles I ended up watching the whole thing in roughly a week.  \\n\r\nUnfortunately most of my prejudices have come true. But let's get on to this step by step. \\n\\n\r\nBe aware that in order to justify my problems I had with the show and especially its story this review WILL INCLUDE MAJOR SPOILERS. In case you have not finished Sword Art Online yet or haven't even started watching this is your last chance to head back. Just head for the 100% spoiler free verdict on the bottom of the review.\\n\\n\r\nSo the story is focused around our main protagonist and totally original \"Kirito\" (or Kirigaya in real life) who is participating in the new and very first VRMMORPG. After a day of trying out the game and getting to meet a guy with the remarkable German name \"Klein\" he spends the day getting him and himself used to the mechanics and talking to each other. As they want to log out they find out their \"log-out\"-buttons are gone from the interface and that there is no way of disconnecting from Sword Art Online. At the end of the first episode the game master appears and tells them that they have to reach the end of the game and defeat the last boss in order to be released and that many people who tried to remove the so called \"NerveGear\", which is an external piece of hardware to get yourself into the game world, have died in the process. Their only chance is to beat the game. \\n\r\nWhile the first episode was really well done and set an interesting tone for what may come next I was surprised it was the opposite of what I expected. At first!\\n\\n\r\nLet's get on to what Sword Art Online does right story wise in a short manner without digging deeper into synopsis. Basically besides the first few episodes and the first one in particular, nothing. I can literally not think of anything that has been achieved well story wise. Let me explain!\\n\\n\r\nAfter the first episode they constantly use time skips to probably skip the time Kirito obviously must have used to become the strongest player in the whole game. He is a walking Deus Ex Machina with an asshole as wide as the moon considering all the stuff the pulls out of his cheeks. Without explaining he is just the strongest because he \"played the beta\" before. This is the only explanation we get and that he is some sort of hybrid of a \"cheater\" and \"beta-player\"; a \"beater\". Breaking the game rules like that can only be considered cheating though because he is the only player being able to dual-wield. How does this work? Thanks to clever writing? Most likely not. But Kirito is not the only problem. It's basically the whole game world which is not only generic as hell but also not explained in how it works at all. There is an orphanage in one scene with the caretaker and children acting like real people. Are those NPCs or real players? If they are NPCs, why even care for them? If they are real people, how can 20 ten year old kids end up in a game like SAO which is obviously intended for mature audiences considering there is an undressing and an implied sex option implemented. This whole thing feels so lazy and watching it made me feel sick because those failures are so obvious.\\n\\n\r\nSame goes for the feature to \"revive dead players\". Excuse me? I thought people are going to die if they are killed in SAO. How can you revive them? Maybe the game gives the players enough time before their brains get toasted by microwaves implemented into the NerveGear. This would have been more plausible but it wasn't explained at all. Such a feature also comes with heavily forced drama and bad character development as well! In one episode we get to know a new character whose turn is it now to have his amount of screen time with badass Kirito - this character is of course female since all the ladies fall for the Black Swordsman, just as the target audience would love as well! So we have this new character on the screen and barely got to know her and in the same episode she dies. And Kirito cries. Boohoo. The whole relationship obviously happened off-screen for Kirito but the audience has been totally unaffected of this connection between Kirito and random-kawaii-replaceable-moeface #54. The same with any other relationships with every other useless girl who could be part of Kirito's harem. But no, they get dumped a few episodes later. Not even the relationship between Kirito and the main female lead Azuna has been given a realistic and believable approach. This is not even forgivable since Azuna is what drives Kirito later on and is what saves Kirito later on.\\n\\n\r\nThings get even worse when they introduce Yui. A sweet and innocent loli with no memories calling Kirito and Azuna her parents. It is later revealed she is a program written by the game master to stay in charge of the trapped people\u2019s mood and prevent them from doing bad things such as suicide. But when the game master got like \"I'll kill you all if you don't beat me\" she was prohibited from interfering with people. And since computer programs obviously have emotions she also got dragged down by witnessing people taking their own lives and the audience was meant to feel sooo bad for her. But I couldn't because this thing felt so damn forced with her sacrificing herself and all this in the end and being a mere plot device and full of conveniences just to end the series. Most of her actions haven't been described at all. It was just happening out of the blue. \\n\\n\r\nAnd all this isn't even due to the episode count because the second half of the series \"Sword Art Online\" has not been given attention to the name giving video game, no! It was another video game called \"Alfheim Online\". The \"ALO\" arc features all your self-insert needs as well! A badass unbeatable ass pulling male lead, lolis, fairies and.... Incest! But before the ALO arc we have the ending to the Sword Art Online-one which is just terrible to say the least. The main villain as interesting as he may have sounded turned out to be a one-dimensional one at best. His motives haven't been explained the least and he even forgot why he did all this. I'm not kidding. He just forgot. Also the last boss was defeated with \"the power of love and friendship and the shounen-force of never giving up\".\\n\\n\r\nAnd now it is up for Alfheim Online because what do we do right after leaving a game after multiple years being hospitalized and having lost around 10 kg looking like a walking dead man while Azuna stayed completely healthy looking? Yes, video games, also VRMMORPGs of course. Also introduced with the new arc is a new villain who is just as flat and plain as the one before just that he just seems to have a rape fetish for teenagers which happen to be the male lead's love interest. Of course he is also the main villain in the game itself who somehow has the ability to make the players feel pain again. It sure was a smart move to not put restrictions on this.\\n\r\nThe second arc also includes tentacle rape and various attempts of what seems like rape. Really going for it all, aren't you, SAO?\\n\\n\r\nALO ends with yet even more plot holes. Yui is just hacking all the way through even when clearly not being part of the game anymore at all. She even was just a minor part of the first game as well not having had any access to vital functions which could change the game rules. Kirito also uses the power of friendship and love again to overcome being pinned down and even having an inner monologue with the dead game master of SAO who somehow given him the information to log into the game and rewrite it so that our evil super villain loses all his strength and even manage to give himself the best sword of the game to finish him off one final time.\\n\\n\r\nSPOILER-FREE-ZONE! READING PAST HERE IS SAVE!\\n\\n\r\nLong story short; the story of SAO is absolutely dreadful. And even the most vital part which was the sense of danger and the feeling that something is at stake which was the case during the SAO arc was completely gone during ALO. It took itself so serious then it was downright laughable.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of art and sound SAO delivers an above average performance. The character designs may not be the most innovative of them all but the backgrounds are pretty, the colors being used offer variety and the interface and HUD were being integrated nicely without being used too much or bothering the visual experience. Yuki Kajiura who is mostly known for her outstanding works in Madoka Magica and Fate/Zero has composed the series soundtrack hence why the music is the best this show has to offer besides the escapism for various individuals. The opening theme was also quite beautiful and the voice actors delivered a more than solid performance while doing their job.\\n\\n\r\nBesides the story the obviously weakest part are the characters. Too little time was used on actually developing them and making us care about them and way too much time was spend on building off-screen relationships the audience could not relate too. Besides the mostly annoying side cast all we have are generic lead characters with a lack of depth. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion Sword Art Online was not something I would recommend. For anyone who wants to watch a show for good characters, writing and world-building Sword Art Online will not be to their likings. If all you want to do is being entertained by obvious flaws and lackluster setting and characters, go ahead. This show might just be exactly your thing.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Sword Art Online:\r\n(This is my first review using a new rating system. If you want to see how this system works, check out 'about me' in my profile. Enjoy!)\r\nSword Art Online is a gamer's dream come true. Sweeping the masses by storm last year, SAO has quickly become one of the most popular anime in recent years. This is probably due to the fact that many anime enthusiasts also happen to be gamers. However, this show has just as many haters as fanboys, so does this show meet up to the hype? For me, as guilty as I may feel saying it, it's a definitiveyes.\\n\\n\r\nStory 7/10:\\n\r\nSword Art Online is about a gamer named Kirito who, along with thousands of other gamers, gets trapped in a virtual reality mmo. To go along with this, if you die in the game, you die in real life. The only way to get out of the game, is to beat all 100 floors of the game, a task that could take years to achieve. Like I said, the concept of this show is tailor made for gamers, and much of the language used is suited for those accustomed to gaming language. With these thoughts in mind, I was hyped to start this anime. However, the first 4 episodes of this show are very poor. The pacing is horrendous, and I strongly considered dropping it during these episodes. After these are out of the way though, the story blooms into something much greater. Basically once Kirito starts spending more time with Asuna, the show starts to become more focused. A split focus between the romance between these characters, and the ultimate goal of beating the game. From episode 4 to 15, the show completely had me under its spell and got me completely hooked. These episodes also really dove into the physiological standpoint of how being trapped in this world for years can effect you. After these episodes, the focus of the show completely shifts. Not that this shift was bad, in fact I really loved the latter half of the series, however, I can see many people being disappointed in the shift the show takes. The concept for this show's plot was fantastic, and besides the first 4 episodes, I loved its execution as well. Admittedly, yes, there are plenty of plotholes, completely blatant flaws in some logic, and the explanation for many key events can be awful at times. Things like this don't really bother me personally, but I know for many people it ruined the show for them, so if that kind of thing gets to you: beware. It definitely wasn't perfect, but I thoroughly enjoyed the story, more than I probably should have. I leave the story with a very good 7/10 because even though there were flaws everywhere, they mostly didnt bother me and the story was great in MY opinion. However, I can completely understand someone giving the story aspect of this show a score MUCH worse.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10:\\n\r\nThe animation, worlds, and characters are all beautifully on display in this anime. The settings of this show are widely varied and beautiful, excellently presenting an mmo-style world in anime form. This was a world that I honestly wanted to be in. What really made the art from this show a masterpiece were the battle scenes. The fights were fluid, and gorgeous. A vast array of battle animations and actions were on display, and the big boss battles were utterly enticing. I really haven't seen an anime before with such an expansive world, and such beautiful action animations.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10:\\n\r\nAs far as music goes, Sword Art Online had a great overall OST. The opening \"Crossing Field\" is personally one of my favorite opening songs in history and is catchy as hell. The music during the scenes all fit the scenes very well, and were definitely more memorable than most soundtracks that I've heard. The voice acting for the show was good as well, although I'm no expert in the world of Japanese voice acting, and 9 times out of 10 pick the dub over the sub when available. It's gotta be a plus though when I can emotionally attach to characters when I don't even understand what they are saying without reading subs.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 7/10:\\n\r\nKirito is what every mmo player secretly wishes they were. A black wearing swordsman who absolutely overpowers everyone he faces. Include that he \"unintentionally\" gets every girl he meets to fall in love with him, and he is the perfect image of what gamers wish they were. This is a slight problem though, because his lack of flaws can make him seem a little one dimensional. For me, it wasn't a huge problem though because like I said, he is an ideal character, which is a joy to watch. It's true that the characters do lack development, some even seemingly regressing instead of progressing. Kirito seems to run in circles with his development, and Asuna does anything but develop. However, the real strength in the characters is the relationship between Kirito, Asuna, and another character that I will avoid due to spoilers. The relationship between these 2 was very stereotypical of a romance on the surface, but for some reason I found myself REALLY caring about it, and hoping that everything would end up happy for them. Unlike the individual characters, the relationship they had DID develop, and was touching to watch. I guess what made these 2 seemingly flawed main characters stand out, is just the fact that they were very likable. They aren't characters that you can really say you hate, you may shake your head or laugh at some of the things they do, but you can see that their intentions are clearly in the right direction. So even thought they really lacked development and in Kirito's case were overpowered, they were still very likable. The side characters were another story though. They seemed to have little to no purpose, popping in and out of the show at random moments. Some got no more than 1 episode of screen time. This made the side characters very insignificant, even though the weren't necessarily bad characters. All in all, there are definitely a few shining characters, but many of the side ones hold this category back from being anything better than \"good.\"\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10:\\n\r\nI enjoyed the $#!+ out of this show. Admittedly, I really didn't care for the first 4 episodes. I even told a friend \"If this show was half as good as its opening song, then I would love it.\" But after powering through these episodes, I slowly started to change my perspective, and ending up loving this show. The whole concept was brilliant, and the way they dive into the psychological and moral aspects of the characters trapped in this world is great. Between the battle scenes, plot twists, romance, and gaming references, this show was ridiculously enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nRecommendation:\\n\r\nI can't say for sure you will love this show due to the divided audience, but I definitely recommend you give it a chance because you might like it as much as, or even more than me.\\n\r\nStream it! +.1\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8.1/10\\n\r\nSword Art Online was a true joy to watch. With a brilliant concept, the show for the most part delivers wonderfully. Although the first 4 episodes weren't the best, the show picks itself up and delivers quite the adventure. The hype surrounding this show is well deserved, and I can't imagine someone who plays any sort of rpg to dislike this show. It absolutely has its flaws and inconsistencies, but I was able to look past them and can confidently say that Sword Art Online was a great show to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe Verdict:\\n\r\nFantastic concept that for the most part delivers. A wide array of appeal, but especially for those who enjoy the fantasy genre and gaming.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+ Fantastic concept\\n\r\n+ Knows its audience (gamers)\\n\r\n+ Touching character relationships\\n\r\n+ World and animations are beautiful\\n\r\n+ OP is one of my favorites\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Less than stellar first 4 episodes\\n\r\n- Plenty of plot holes/poor explanation\\n\r\n- Lack of character development\\n\r\n- Drastic plot change could definitely disappoint some people\\n\\n\r\nIf you liked Sword Art Online, then watch....\\n\r\nFate/Zero:\\n\r\nMainly because they are both action oriented and the main characters are sword wielders, I also needed an excuse to recommend Fate/Zero lol.\\n\r\nAccel World:\\n\r\nMost people who have liked SAO like Accel World as far as I know. Both are themed around virtual reality games, and both are set in the same universe.\\n\\n\r\n8.1/10 - Great\\n",

            "content": "This is my first ever anime review so don't hate if it's not perfect. I find it really funny that none of the reviews for this anime are above 5. People like to hate I guess. I think this is definitely one of the best animes ever made and doesn't deserve all the hate that it gets.\r\nArt: 10\r\nEverything in Sword Art Online is beautifully done. The art is AMAZING. Every scene has amazing backgrounds and the character designs aren't lacking in the least. The battle scenes are so well that it doesn't look choppy or like the producers just wanted to get through the scene.They put just as much effort into each scene to add to our enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nOST is amazing and that's it. No need to go in depth because the music fits so well with the show and with each and every scene. Not to mention the OPs and EDs are both amazing.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nThe part that bugs me the most is when they say that this has a boring plot/story. HOW BLINDED CAN YOU BE? The characters are trapped inside the game of Sword Art Online and if they die in the game, they die in real life. There is no way that this plot point is boring. We follow the male protagonist named Kirito who was in the beta test for the game. He is outcast from everyone else due to that fact and therefore becomes a lone wolf. Each episode of the anime came with suspensions and excitement. You never clearly knew what was going to happen until it happened (unless you read the light novels). I will admit that the second half of the anime became a little bit more predictable but was enjoyable for me nonetheless. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7\\n\r\nThe characters in Sword Art Online feel like real people for the most part. They interact with each other like real people and have EMOTIONS. They aren't bland but all there emotions come from their feeling of being frightened because at any moment they could die. They are trapped inside a game where they can't get out and if they die in the game, they have no future. They face this challenge with either bravery or cowardice. The characters are really easy to like and you want to them to beat the game and to head back to the real world. You know that with each coming episode that they may die, giving you the need to attach to each character for the time you see them for you don't know when they will be gone. The romance between the characters is amazing as well. Best since Clannad in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI loved every episode and couldn't wait each week for the next episode to come out. That new episode each week made the top 5 things I need to do each week. 1. Breathe 2. Eat 3. Sleep 4. Watch the next episode of Sword Art Online 5. School. I was deeply saddened when the series came to an end. It was one of the best experiences I have had. I can't wait for a season two. I know they are going to have one because how could the producers leave us now when Sword Art Online is definitely one of the most popular anime to date. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nThis anime is one of my favorites and I doubt there will ever be a fantasy/romance anime that can be better than this. Each episode was an experience for me. It wasn't just another anime to pass my free time. Everything from sound to story made this anime really enjoyable. This show definitely doesn't deserve the hate it gets from reviewers. I recommend this show to everyone I can, especially people who like Romance and Action.",

            "content": "If you're a person who doesn't like to read much, here's a mini review. It sucks, but at the same time it doesn't. There.\r\nAs for the people who will be happy to read this unnecessarily long review, I appreciate it.  \r\nJust like a lot of people say, Sword Art Online comes off as an anime where you either love it or hate it to bits. I thought the first three episodes was excellent, introducing the virtual reality game, Sword Art Online, giving us the feel on what it is like to play the game (such as the boss battle) and psychological break down peopleexperience (which was shown in episode 3). But after that, it felt as if the writer decided to smoke crack and took a huge dump on his own story along with being completely out of ideas after that\\n\\n\r\nThe first biggest concern is the characters. No one has any depth to him or her. Asuna is introduced as a mysterious girl who kicks ass, turns out to be your generic annoying tsundere who I would like to teabag just to get them to shut the hell up. Kirito, for some stupid reason knows how to charm the chicks even though he spends his whole life staying inside his room playing games all day and is the most overpowered person in the game for some retarded reason, not to mention that he has absolutely no flaws. From what I witnessed, he is the ultimate unbeatable character throughout the whole show, so after getting to the second arc, you just know that he is going to obviously win the next battle. The rest of the characters are just your stereotypical harem baits that are not even relevant to the plot and are just there just to make the protagonist look like a chick magnet. But the villains\u2026they are just bad. To not spoil anything about them (oh wait, what is there to spoil?), the villains have no motives of being evil and are just plot devices for the entire show. They come off as obnoxious and pathetic. Pffthahaha, I can\u2019t believe Kirito praised Kayaba\u2019s existence. \\n\\n\r\nThe second biggest concern is definitely the writing. The writing and the story is absolutely horrible. Throughout watching the show, I kept predicting how old the writer is from time to time. The dialogue comes off as predictable, childish like, clich\u00e9 and just utterly stupid. The romance was way too forced into the show and it felt as if the creator just did it so that Kirito could look more like a man if he had a girlfriend as a prop.  The romance was as poorly written, almost as poorly as the Twilight franchise. It\u2019s like the writer guessed how romances work. Just because a guy meets a girl, doesn\u2019t mean that you have to force love upon them. They don\u2019t even have a good reason to like each other, Kirito sucks as a person and Asuna is nothing but a generic tsundere. Man I would have enjoyed the progression of the relationship more if they could include chapter 16.5 from the novel. Back to the topic. The dialogue between Kirito and Asuna. It\u2019s\u2026it\u2019s bloody retarded. One of the most stupid scenes I thought was when Asuna told Kirito that she would kill herself if he dies. Really? They don\u2019t know each other in real life and she is willing to take her own life because of some professional gamer? Bravo. Also throughout the whole show, the things Kirito and Asuna say to each other is absolutely predictable, you know when Asuna would go tsun and you would know when she would go dere. But what made the relationship between these two was when they introduced us to our beloved loli\u2026Yui-chan. Bleh. At least Yui doesn\u2019t come off as retarded as Fuko-chan from Clannad. God I want to strangle that kid and put her back in a coma. Ok spoiler alert, read at your own risk. Or probably you\u2019ve already seen Sword Art Online so who cares. Yui is nothing but another plot device and a moeblob of the show. She starts calling Kirito and Asuna her parents because\u2026THE HECK WOULD I KNOW? Then later on the newly wedded couple decided to keep her as a child and treat her as if they were actually her parents. \u201cAwww, that\u2019s so sweet\u2026\u201d No it\u2019s not! It\u2019s stupid. How old are these two again? 16 and 17. Wow it\u2019s like I\u2019m back to going on IMVU watching people create their own families because their real life family sucks.\\n\\n\r\nMore rants? Yes please. Clich\u00e9 scenes! Or just dumb scenes! There is Deus Ex Machina writing everywhere. Because I don\u2019t want to spoil the show much, I'll just say that even if he got killed inside the game, he still came back to life because...I don't know. It seems as if the writer couldn't think of anything good and decided to slap something random in just for the plot to progress and all I could think of is how lazy that writer is. Wow. But ass pulls gets even worse in the climax of the second arc. There was also a scene where Kirito just tries to sacrifice himself even though he could save himself along with the others, but the writer only does this just for the sake of shoving in more melodrama than this show already needs. But I won\u2019t talk about that scene, because I would be \u201cspoiling the show.\u201d \\n\\n\r\nIt actually seems like I\u2019m bashing the anime too much so I guess I\u2019ll talk about what makes this show good.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack and music is absolutely amazing. Definitely the ones used in the action scenes. It just sounded so kickass. It actually makes you feel privileged to watch the show because of it. When players open the menu or whatever you like to call it, you feel you ears having an orgasm every time you hear those beepity boop sounds. The action scenes in this show is absolutely well done, being mixed with the soundtrack would have your eyes and ears peeled to the screen. You would know that this show had a lot of budget, it\u2019s a shame it\u2019s wasted on this pathetic excuse of an anime. Oops, I wasn\u2019t meant to be ranting any more.\\n\\n\r\nThe other great thing about this show is that you can never get bored. Even when I noticed the flaws and started hating it while it was still being aired, I was having so much fun watching the show. When you watch Sword Art Online, you feel as if the episode is just zooming through really fast and you feel unsatisfied by the end of the episode and then you just want the next episode already(this is how I felt while it was still being aired.) The show actually knows how to engage you and immerse you into the virtual reality game and you feel as if you want to be in that game. Side stories were okay by me, since this anime introduces different ways on how the mechanics of the game works. Such as cooking, fishing, training, gaining exp to level up, finding rare items etc. There was so much things explored in this show and it makes you want to see more of this. Sadly these things are only shown in the first arc, the second arc is filled with \u201cI have to save Asuna from this very bad man who does bad things because of plot!\u201d\\n\\n\r\nSo overall, Sword Art Online is definitely an entertaining show, but it comes off as utterly stupid from clich\u00e9 writing, bad characters and utterly horrible use of dialogues. This show is nothing more than a wish fulfilment show for otakus who would like anything generic. I actually would recommend it to people who are actually new to anime, because it\u2019s shows like these that actually bring more western people into the anime world.  Even though Sword Art Online is a guilty pleasure, you would see it being a score of 1/10 in my list, since I\u2019m one of those people who really hate it. But then again, who the hell has a neutral opinion of Sword Art Online. It\u2019s either hating it or loving it. Overall I will give this show a kind of fair rating for this review with a solid score of\u2026\\n\\n\r\n3/10\\n",

Sat down in front of your computer, logged into a virtual world, and then realize that the next time you got up from your seat was 5 hours later?\r\nIf you ever had this kind of experience, I can say with 90% certainty that you will enjoy SAO. On the other hand, if you have had little experience with online games, you may not be able to truly appreciate SAO.\r\n-Story: 9/10 -\r\nWhen I completed the first arc - Aincrad, SAO was still ongoing. Unable to wait, I went ahead and read the entires series by Reki Kawahara. On the basisthat the anime is directly adapted from the light novel series, I can only say that the story is excellent. From start to end, SAO is able to capture the best elements of MMOs(leveling, questing, guild-forming, raids etc), and combine it with a realistic and entrancing vision of a futuristic game based in the floating castle Aincrad. With regards to the adaptation itself, Aniplex is able to piece together the main plot as well as the SAO side stories to give a reasonable chronological recount of the events that transpired in Aincrad. Of course, the adaptation has its flaws, mainly with respect to the development of the relationship between the two main characters.\\n\\n\r\nAlfheim Online, the second arc, brings the perspective back to the real world and is an excellent follow up to the first arc. \\n\\n\r\n-Art: 10/10-\\n\r\nThe art stays true to the style shown in the light novel series. The coloring is done in a very satisfactory fashion that does justice to the vibrance of the virtual world. The lines may be over-simplistic but then that can be easily overlooked as an aspect of anime itself. In terms of animation, there is no sign of having too many stills that give a 'cheap' feeling to some other series, and the action sequences are very captivating.\\n\\n\r\n-Sound: 10/10-\\n\r\nThe voice-acting is good, although I sometimes feel that the protaganist's voice is overly soft and calm at times. The prolonged battle cries in certain scenes may also be slightly exaggerated, but that is indeed the way it was depicted in the light novel, with the multitude of \"Uwa-ah-ah-ah!\"s' and such.\\n\\n\r\n-Character: 6/10-\\n\r\nAs I mentioned above, the length of the anime is far too short to flesh out the characters. Especially with the inclusion of basically all the Aincrad side-stories, the love-story in the light novel that Aniplex had hoped to bring out in the animation had gone awry, and indeed does not feel right as many others have already said. With the conclusion of these two animated arcs there is also a justifiable feeling that the main character seems like a deux-ex-machina with not enough human qualities. To me, though, this is still better than the psychologically insecure/self-deprecating/extreme-sociopath/extreme-chauvinistic main characters in other animes that I will not name.\\n\\n\r\n-Overall: 9-\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, even though I knew exactly what is going to happen having read the light novel, I was still able to finish all 11 episodes of the second arc in one sitting. My advice if you are planning to watch the anime is to just enjoy the action sequences and the vibrant virtual game worlds, and not to expect too much in the way of character development. If at that point of time, you are still able to enjoy SAO, then I highly recommend the light novel series by Reki Kawahara.",

Honestly how can it get any better... Was what I first thought... This anime disappointed me, it turned into a horrendous harem all of a sudden as our main protagonist was wooing the hearts of our female characters, and to add to that, it was like 20% action and 50% slice of life and 30% of romance! Also it was incredibly short and they skipped out like4 or 5 months each episode! But around episode 14 the game is completed as our main protagonist, Kirito defeats the final boss, Kayaba Akihiko, the creation of the game. Everyone who survived was released though unfortunately, those who died in the game, remain dead...\\n\\n\r\nA new arc had appeared with a new MMO. This time one of Kirito's dear friends was not released and is trapped in the new MMO, AlfHeim Online (ALO). He goes into the game and teams up with another female protagonist (as if we didn't see that coming -_-) to save his friend. This arc is terrible in my opinion, they act like death in the game is a big deal when really, you remain alive?! so why make a big deal out of it?!\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is a decent anime, which is too overrated, but worth checking out. I give this anime a 4/10. Peace!\\n\\n\r\nP.S. this is my first review btw",

            "content": "Sword art online, now what can I say that hasn't been said yet? Well, after reading through the reviews of this anime, I can tell that the reviewers seem to have mixed opinions about this it. The scores given to this anime are all over the place, ranging from 1 to 10. I am one of those people who really are enjoying the it, and I have reasons for them too. Now, at this point, it is quite clear that this anime has a very fast pace, which has turned quite a few people off toward this anime, but I don't really think that's fair,because as of this point, there are only 10 episodes out of 25, so it's too early to judge. Even with the pacing issues, I still really enjoy it, and I really only notice the fast pacing in a selected few episodes, and those were side stories. Now, I've read the LN. Now I know that the LN is a better experience, however I was very impressed with the execution. Though a few episodes had pacing problems, it was only the side stories, when the anime reached the main plot, the pacing felt MUCH better. Now, I know that a lot of people criticize this anime due to its pacing, but also with its characters, plot and cliches. I don't tend to nitpick on cliches, because I don't see a reason to, if we always nitpicked about cliches, then that will just take away the enjoyment of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nNow, first let's talk about the story. I really like the story, even though the whole virtual reality concept isn't new, the feeling of it just separates itself from those others. Basically, there is this new game called sword art online, which is the first virtual reality game made, and of course, people are extremely eager to buy this game. Around ten thousand people have bought this game, and are trying it out, including our MC. So, the mc just entered this virtual world, along with the other 10 000 people, but then they realize that this game, there is no logout button. After that, they learn that they can not only can they not logout, but a death in this game will result in a death in real life. Now the story may not sound like much, it actually is very deep when you look at it. To me, it feels like the game creator wanted to this game like real life, because the concept is something like real life, except for stuff like item drops and other RPG elements. This show also includes quite a lot of psychological elements to it. The normal person would think that in this situation, everyone would freak out and go insane, now that is true, and it was inplemented into the anime at the beginning, so I don't understand people saying this is unrealistic. Because this is a virtual reality, it is quite like real life, except with RPG stuff, and these people are all gamers, so of course over time, they will adapt to this new world. The story is pretty much that, because the majority of the story is character interactions. Well, being trapped in a virtual game for 2 years, of course there wouldn't be much else to show but characters and their interactions with eachother.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nNow, it may not say this, but this anime is defiantly a harem, as a lot of girls seem to take a liking to the mc with their time spent together. Most of the harem stuff is from the side stories, but that's to be expected. The main story however mainly focuses on the romance between 2 characters, which is nice. after reading the reviews, I find people lacking the enjoyment of the characters, which makes sense, because of the fast pace kind of affecting the character development, but I still think the characters are very likable and have so much more depth than what other people say about them being one-dimensional. So the mc is pretty much an average guy in real life, but ingame, he is a badass solo player who is probably one of the strongest players in the game. Now, that has to due with him being a beta tester. Since he played the game before, he knew where the good places are for grinding exp. many players despise him due to him being a beta tester, so they give him the title \"beater\" now as you can probably tell, this guy doesnt fool around,mwhen the game master announced the part about not being able to logout, he quickly gets over it and moves toward his goal. Which also explains his success as a player, since I don't think he spent his time fooling around during the beta test like some others. The character interaction is very well done. He pretty much solos everything because he doesn't want to feel responsible for the deaths of his teammates. Also in episode 3, it pretty much explains why he solos stuff, he joined a guild, and lied about his level so it would be more likely to except him, but I also think he did that so he could fit in more, so he didn't feel so different from them. He made friends with people in that guild, but he was a beater, so the title came back to bite when his guild fell for a trap and all died. After that, he felt if he told the truth, he could have warned them, since they would know he has more experience about it, and so he begins to feel guilty. Also when he tries to get the revive crystal, he tells people he has to fight by himself, or else if someone else dies in the process, there would be no point. I really think the characters are very deep, and I don't like to complain like others how he is so overpowered, and appears to get girls all over him, even though this game contains mostly male players. But remember, the mc has a good personality, and it perp is way of dealing with difficult situations that made him so powerful, so I won't complain about that like people who blindly watch the show and complain. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nOne word, \"AMAZING\" I really love it, the soundtracks fit this medieval setting perfect, and the music playing during boss battles makes it sound epic. Also the opening theme is very lovable. I also love the sound affects like when they charge the swords. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nBeautiful, they set the virtual setting very nicely, and the character designs are very good, what more do I need to say?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the anime, and many others have too. I tend to overlook those common complaints, and I really think it is more enjoyable when you think about the story and characters more, because there is much more logic than when you just watch with your eyes. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, a very good series, and I definitely recommend it!",

            "content": "Ok... Finally finished SAO, and this is an edited review.\r\nBefore I start this, people there will probably be many who may disagree, but also agree, but before that, I just got to say that this anime is probably one of the most spectacular anime I have seen in many months, or even year. Aside from that, there are people who hate this anime for whatever their reasons are, and those who love it and think this is a masterpiece. \r\nI believe that most people considered this an amazing anime, i wondered why at first but ever since i started the first episode, i just couldn'tstop until the latest episodes that had aired. (the anime club i'm in decided to watch this anime) i basically though this was like .Hack, but it was much better in every quality aspect (my opinion, you have the right to disagree.) everyone who likes games and Is an otaku Should, or maybe Need to watch this. Now what I'm going to review and write is my own opinion so... you know... :3\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\r\nEven though i say this, i don't COMPLETELY think that it's the best in the world. In fact, I think that some part of the story of SAO is moving very fast, or even abrupt. The main reason why I said this (my grading) is because of my personal favorite genre. Adding action, game, romance, adventure, some  fantasy, but I kinda believe that someday in the future it maybe possible, and only Some slice of life to it. The timing is just right also. Instead of making us sit there and wasted like 30 eps so the main character could lv up, they just skip the little things and go to the main things, which keeps viewers, like me, excited and mostly on the climax. SAO is pretty easy to follow. It's not some sort of complex anime, like Durarara where you skip back and forth between the present and the past, and not really anything to think about, so the viewers who dislike using brain power probably will like this. So yea... that's why I rated SAO as 10 for the story. Not much side tracks so you should be able to enjoy it much much more than many others. I actually thought at first that SAO would probably be like other typical anime where it will get boring sooner or later as you continued to watch, but it's, in my opinion, the complete opposite. The genres, however, did slightly change. If I'm not mistaken on this one, I would say that the first arc had a slightly more action than the second arc, but the second have more romance and tears of joy instead of tears of depression and sadness. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nYea.... will people these days are pretty good, and better than in the past. They got more Waaalaaa to the art now, so i don't really think there's anything to say. One thing that really stands out are the emotion that the characters are giving in the anime. The face clearly expressed the situation and the motive they have. It has feeling that could be expressed without words, and that, for me, is really impressive. The movement, the face, the shadows etc. really fit in and there's pretty much nothing to complain about. I could be wrong, since the story pulls me in, and I don't have that much energy to pay attention much to the art. I gave SAO's art a 9 instead of a 10 is because sometime, I feel as if the characters expression are sometime over done, and can be seen with a little too much emotions. Just my opinion of course.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nI especially like this anime because the sounds are great to listen to, and it feels smooth, reeling me in more to the anime. The background fits in to the environment nicely, surrounding SAO and makes this anime more realistic and natural. What excites me the most is how they used the sounds, making the anime sounds much like you're watching a game, or better yet, making you feel as if you Are in it. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nThe characters are very nice. Not boring, not annoying or anything that just makes you wanna smash whatever is in front of your eye on to the little PC or device you're watching from. I experienced it before. Not sure if anyone of you guys have, but anyway... Since I now have completed SAO, I can see that the characters are the same whether they are in the game or in reality, and what that mean is, if Kirito is perfect then, he will always be perfect now, although that's a debatable matter. Romance anime have the type of crying that I would say are annoying, phony, and irritating to my ears. For SAO, I could really grab on to them and kind of interact with it, as in, the reasons of why they are crying the way they do or take hold of the situation and imagine f I was in their place, which really matches on how I would feel. This of course is based on who you are, and your personality. Those who just love seeing their friends, or just anyone close to they suffer or die would definitely disagree with me on this one. Romance anime usually have people crying about useless things, but SAO made a lot of senses in the timing of when the character should be happy, sad, angry, or derpy.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nNothing to say here, since I mostly put the enjoyment rating the same as the story. It's good to have something to enjoy, and I've been waiting so long for these kind of anime to come out. Although this anime has the time in the story where you Cannot help but tightens your fist as hard as you can, since the scene are unbearable to watch. YOU ALL KNOW WHAT I\"M TALKING ABOUT. HOW DARE HE TOUCH, AND SNIFF ON HER EXCELLENCY?! \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nI'm sure that not everyone will agree with me here, but at least everyone could agree with Some thing I typed down. I personally think that SAO is very emotional from the beginning to the end, and that is really just what I think. I've seen many who does not seem think that way. Well then... I would gladly say that this is one of my favorite anime. Of course there are others which I seem to enjoyed as equivalent as SAO. I hope this help anyone who are planing to watch this someday.",

            "content": "Sword Art Online was one of the first animes I\u2019ve watched. Because of all the hype that surfaced upon its release, I had rather high expectations for SAO. I wouldn\u2019t say that I was completely disappointed by it, but I\u2019d be lying if I said that I wasn\u2019t. I don\u2019t think that SAO was as bad as some people chalked it up to be, but I can definitely see where those people were coming from. Either way, after I watched the last episode, I stared at my computer screen for a little while, grieving over all of the lost potential. That being said, I watchedit quite some time ago, so my apologies if anything in here is inaccurate. \\n\\n\r\n\tStory: 5/10\\n\r\n\tThe premise of it (not the execution) was rather interesting and it had so much potential to be a decent anime. (Honestly, it had the chance to be a great anime, but I digress.) The first three or so episodes set the scene for the rest of the show, but after that it went downhill. There were so many fillers in the beginning that really didn\u2019t have anything to do with the rest of the plot. Sure, it showed Kirito in action, but overall, those episodes could have been omitted and not much would have been affected. All they served to do was introduce a bunch of characters who didn\u2019t really make any appearances in later episodes. In fact, the characters introduced just fell in love with Kirito and were shown for maybe two seconds in the last episode(s) to show how jealous they were over Kirito and Asuna\u2019s relationship. \\n\r\n\tWhen they returned to the main (I use that term lightly) plot of the first arc, things were all over the place and overall, things made sense and there was a resolution. But, there were still ten episodes left. So, why not just rehash the first arc and plop them back into a virtual world? Honestly, I\u2019m not going to go into detail about the Alfheim arc because this would take up an entire page. It was flat and clich\u00e9d and I did not like it. \\n\\n\r\n\tCharacters: 4/10\\n\r\n\tSo, let\u2019s begin with our main protagonist, Kirito. I hate using this term, but he was a generic Gary-Stu. He doesn\u2019t have any flaws (evident ones at least) and a bunch of girls fall for him. And of course, of all the girls in his harem, he falls for the girl who at first didn\u2019t like him but eventually warms up. Who saw that coming? Also, Kirito overpowers his enemies rather easily. I\u2019m not much of a gamer, but from what I\u2019ve seen, it takes more than a couple of flashy sword slashes to take down supposedly powerful enemies. Kirito is overall a flat character. \\n\r\n\tNext we have our demi protagonist, Asuna. She\u2019s beautiful, badass, and can cook. I had rather high hopes for her; before I watched SAO, I saw her as a strong fighter who was still pretty. However, in the middle of the first arc, Kirito started making all of her decisions for her and she become completely reliant on him. Sure, she could still hold her own and poke things with her sword, but she didn\u2019t do anything. The second arc didn\u2019t help her cause: Asuna was locked away in a tower and even though she sought to find a way out, it obviously didn\u2019t work. I\u2019ve heard arguments that she had to be mentally strong while she was in there, and I agree. Yet, while that holds true, we didn\u2019t get to see any of her mental strength. What we did see was her crying and praying for her beloved Kirito to save her. After the first arc, all she served to do was provide (rather creepy) fanservice and sit around, waiting for Kirito.\\n\r\n\tYui is their \u201cchild\u201d. She\u2019s adorable and helps her daddy cheat the game to find Asuna. I didn\u2019t really expect much from her, but the thing that annoys me about her was the fact that she was probably around eight/nine years old and spoke like a two-year-old. Maybe this was just me being picky, but that was unsettling.\\n\r\n\tNext is Suguha/Leafa. Not many people like her for obvious reasons, but I honestly think that she is one of the better characters of the show. She infamously falls in love with Kirito twice even though they\u2019re siblings/cousins/I\u2019m not really sure anymore. However, the fact that she still helps Kirito and tries to be happy for him and Asuna shows that she does, in fact, have a personality. I actually like Suguha and she\u2019s my favorite character in SAO. (Although that really doesn\u2019t say much because I don\u2019t really like any character in it.)\\n\r\n\tThe rest of the characters were all brushed aside and for the most part, useless. (Including the villains whose names I don\u2019t remember, which goes to show exactly how much SAO developed the supporting characters.)\\n\\n\r\n\tArt: 9/10\\n\r\n\tThere isn\u2019t much to say here. The art is beautiful and the character designs were great for the most part. However, the fact that Kirito basically has the same appearance in Alfheim as he does in the real world was confusing. They could have at least made him look a little different, but like I said, that might just be my nitpickiness.  \\n\\n\r\n\tSound: 8/10\t\\n\r\n\tThe openings and endings are wonderful, but that\u2019s not a hard thing to do. I said earlier that Yui\u2019s voice irritated me, but those aren\u2019t really problems when compared to the overall issues with SAO.\\n\\n\r\n\tEnjoyment: 4/10\t\\n\r\n\tI\u2019m not really sure what to even put here; I definitely enjoyed some facets of SAO, such as the animation and music, but for the most part, it fell flat. The fillers did provide some entertainment and some moments were heartwarming.\\n\\n\r\n\tOverall: 4/10\t\\n\r\n\tIn general, I was disappointed by SAO and the amount of fans is has baffles me. I would not re-watch it and it was a let down for me. There were some high aspects of it, but pretty animation and nice music doesn\u2019t make up for stale characters and a bland plot. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "PART ONE\r\nEPISODES 1-14\r\nSword Art Online is one of the greatest achievements in anime. This is not because it\u2019s good, it\u2019s because people actually watch this show and think they\u2019re watching something that\u2019s worth their time. Go to any mall and you\u2019ll find that your local Hot Topic and FYE are covered in pictures of Kirito and Asuna. Go to any convention and you\u2019re going to be surrounded by people who think Sword Art Online is  something worth cosplaying. Populate any forum and you\u2019re bound to find tons of people defending the shit out of a show that makes no sense, has very little characterization,takes itself way too seriously, and is a goddam trainwreck from beginning to end.\\n\\n\r\nBut instead of bitching at people who like it, let\u2019s bitch at the show itself. For those who don\u2019t know, it\u2019s a series surrounding the idea that a bunch of players get trapped inside a virtual reality RPG and the only way to escape is to clear the game. If they die in the game, they die in real life. Okay, that\u2019s a pretty decent set-up for a death game scenario. But then it gets stupid. The game was apparently created by a company where no one said \u201cHey, this death game thing is kind of fucked up.\u201d  Then you get to the death game scenario and all the rules. If the headsets are pulled off in the real world, the person will die. If the headset is disconnected from an outlet, there is a battery that will fry the persons brain if they die. So no one will ever figure out to drain the battery, take the damn helmets off, and save the fucking people early on.\\n\\n\r\nOur main hero is Kirito, a beta tester who\u2019s one of  the most wooden characters in any anime. He has the emotional capacity of celery and is as interesting to watch as tennis. After seeing a guild die and being blamed for not helping save people (as he was a beta tester), he decides to go full emo and become a loner. But every episode after this is about him teaming up with some damsel in distress, completely throwing aside the lone wolf persona. Time goes by in between these episodes, sometimes months or even a year, but it would be a good idea to throw in something that shows him working alone to reinforce the idea rather than make him out to be such a \u201cbadass\u201d then have him team up over and over.\\n\\n\r\nKirito is a pussy magnet. He\u2019s picking up girls left and right in a ridiculous manner. At first it\u2019s Silica, the obligatory loli whose episode adds nothing to the series. Then it\u2019s Lisbeth, whose episode adds nothing to the series. Then it\u2019s Asuna. The development between Asuna and Kirito is so fucking fast that you\u2019ll think you\u2019re missing about ten episodes. They go from liking each other, to sharing their first kiss, to marrying, to having a child in the span of two or three episodes. This is how fast the series moves. It doesn\u2019t think to slow down and expand upon anything or build characters, it wants to get over with as much as we want it over with.\\n\\n\r\nKirito can do no wrong which is my biggest problem with him. He\u2019s overpowered to the point that any action scenes lose all drama. He helps everyone despite any sort of danger. He\u2019s so dull. Even when he\u2019s in emotional situations he\u2019s  fucking boring. And to add to that is his awful dialogue. At one point he and Asuna are watching the sunset on a porch. He says, and I am not kidding you, \u201cDon\u2019t fall over the balcony. That would suck.\u201d It\u2019s completely out of place dialogue, doesn\u2019t fit the scene, is really awkward, and pervades his character through the whole series. At one point he fucking says that NPCs are real people. He\u2019s\u2026.Jesus he\u2019s terrible.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have Asuna. Asuna starts off pretty badass. She\u2019s hot, she\u2019s powerful, she\u2019s graceful. But then she falls apart. She depends on Kirito to save her, becomes a damsel in distress despite being second in command of the most powerful guild in the game. One minute she\u2019s murdering something, the next discussing marriage in completely awkward dialogues with Kirito. Then she\u2019s the best cook around. Then she wants a leave of absence from the Knights of the Blood Oath and can\u2019t get it unless Kirito battles for her (and of course, she has no say despite being the second in command?). And then she\u2019s all tears and hiding behind Kirito and contributing to the most boring romance in anime history. \u201cI love you.\u201d \u201cI love you.\u201d \u201cI love you.\u201d \u201cWe barely know each other, got married inside a game after not even dating, we\u2019re probably two totally different people in the real world, but I fucking love you. Let\u2019s be together forever!\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThen you have Silica and Liz. Both are in love with Kirito, both contribute nothing to the show. They\u2019re fap bait. Are you fapping yet?\\n\\n\r\nOne of the problems with this anime is how serious it takes itself despite being so full of stupidity. And that may be what ultimately ruins this series. It\u2019s so fast, it\u2019s so sexualized, and it\u2019s so stupid that it\u2019s hard to watch it with a serious face. Half an episode is dedicated to fishing and the next half is a huge boss fight. It\u2019s so badly paced and inconsistent because of that. It spends whole episodes on pointless characters and subplots instead of focusing on the main thread. And when it does focus on the main story, it goes so fast you barely have time to think about what you watched. I have a theory that if the Aincrad arc was twenty-six episodes, this series would actually be good. It\u2019d give the characters enough room to breathe and develop, give the plot enough time to build, and give the viewer enough time to figure out what the hell they\u2019re watching. Instead, in fourteen episodes we clear up the kind of plot that would take any other series one or two full seasons to finish satisfactorily.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, I feel, if the anime had spent more time focusing on the Aincrad arc I could forgive the stupid parts more. I could forgive the fact Kirito and Asuna saw a fucking ghost inside a video game. I could forgive the \u201cDONT LOOK AT MY PANTIES KIRITO\u201d Silica scene. I could forgive the \u201cDONT LOOK AT MY PANTIES EVEN THOUGH WE\u2019RE IN LOVE BAKA\u201d Asuna scene. I could forgive more because it wouldn\u2019t be such concentrated stupidity. But, it is what it is, and what it is is stupid.\\n\\n\r\nLike, I can\u2019t even express all of the problems I had with it because there were so many. From beginning to end it\u2019s full of dumb  scenes, bad writing, terrible directing. We have a depressing scene about a dead friend and we focus on the girls ass as the dramatic music plays. Running from a powerful boss, Kirito and Asuna run toward the camera as the camera spins like a record. There is an  introduction to dismemberment when Kirito loses his hand  and then he grows it back and dismemberment is never used again. Where\u2019s the explanation of the special skills like dual-wielding other than they are convenient plot devices?  All kinds of small, silly things that compound to make this such an unappealing package.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then there\u2019s the end.\\n\\n\r\nAsuna and Kirito are married. They adopt a girl named Yui. Of course, she turns out to be super powerful and some sort of psychological counseling service for the game. What the fuck? Since when have RPGs had psychologist AI to take care of the suicidal people sick and tired of having to grind? She winds up disappearing and Kirito uses a console to save her data to his headset and turn her heart into a pendant. Because he magically knows how to use a command console\u2026what?\\n\\n\r\nThe series doesn\u2019t end on level one hundred, the final level of the game, it ends on level seventy-five. Kirito defeats the final boss on this level. It\u2019s a complete tease, ending things super early and nonsensically. Asuna dies, Kirito dies, the guy who created the game dies. But they all meet together and watch the world fall apart. And then they ask why the guy built the game and wanted to kill people  and he says \u201cEh, I don\u2019t remember.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nAmazing.\\n\\n\r\nAnd despite dying, Asuna and Kirito still survive. Like\u2026what the fuck happened? Episode fourteen is bullshit. It makes no sense.\\n\\n\r\nYou want to like Sword Art Online. It\u2019s got cute girls, it\u2019s got excellent animation, it\u2019s got good music. But it\u2019s so fucking bad. It\u2019s a broken pile of garbage with very few redeeming qualities. There are a few episodes that are pretty decent, but it\u2019s overall so plagued with stupid that those glimmers of hope are stomped out. There are ways to fix it too. Make the Aincrad arc longer, don\u2019t prematurely ejaculate your story on episode fourteen, make Kirito likeable, don\u2019t take yourself seriously. This is not a recommended show. In fourteen episodes it\u2019s proven itself juvenile and weak in nearly every creative process. I didn\u2019t even mention half the problems with the Aincrad arc for brevity\u2019s sake, so you can only imagine what else is wrong here. Just watch .Hack.I promise it\u2019s better.\\n\\n\r\nAnd\u2026.I still have eleven episodes left of this season. And then a whole second season that started airing a few days ago.\\n\\n\r\nGod save my soul.\\n\\n\r\nPART TWO\\n\r\nEPISODES 15-25\\n\r\nMany people pan the second half of Sword Art Online more than the first and, truthfully, I don\u2019t get it. Compared to the first arc this second arc is so much better paced, with a lot more emotional attachment to the plot and characters. That\u2019s not to say that it isn\u2019t stupid, because from the outset it\u2019s really dumb. But it manages to make me care about the series and want to see it come to a satisfying conclusion. Much like the first arc, though, it prematurely ejaculates its\u2019 story, leaving a protracted epilogue, and it also throws in another few vaginas for Kirito to plunder. But aside from that\u2026I\u2019m really not that disgusted with this arc.\\n\\n\r\nAsuna is stuck inside of virtual reality after her consciousness has been transferred to a different game built on the same engine as Sword Art Online, this one called Alfheim Online. Kirito finds out about it after pictures leak of Asuna\u2019s avatar stuck inside a bird cage. He also learns that she is to be married off to an up-and-coming member of Asuna\u2019s father\u2019s company, a total creep who sniffs her hair and touches her all over with a perpetual rape face. Now our hero must enter a new virtual reality, battle his way to the top, and save the love of his life.\\n\r\nThere are a number of problems with this scenario, the main one being the fact that a game was developed while players were trapped in Sword Art Online based on Sword Art Online\u2019s engine and servers. That\u2019s just plain stupid. On top of that is the arranged marriage between Asuna and Sugou. Asuna hates him so he\u2019s created some sort of mind control/mind changing system by using the NerveGears to manipulate her and other players to his control. That\u2019s dumb. Really dumb.\\n\\n\r\nBut despite all that the journey to save Asuna is decently paced, much better than the first arc. There\u2019s one episode where Kirito and his companion, Leafa, backtrack for some internal politics that don\u2019t matter and only serve as a reason to create an ass-saving scenario later in the story, but otherwise I was impressed that it stayed on track and kept me interested.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, there is the niggling problem of Suguha. I have a love/hate relationship with her character. She\u2019s Kirito\u2019s sister in the real world who\u2019s madly in love with him because they\u2019re not really related and blah-blah-blah. That\u2019s stupid. Even stupider is how coincidental it is that Leafa, her in-game avatar, and Kirito end up meeting up inside a game with thousands of players, befriend each other, she falls in love with the Kirito avatar to try to take her mind off her brother, and then the avatar winds up being her brother. That is so contrived and stupid and adds a drama level that is completely unneeded. And the worst part is, Suguha is the best female character in the entire fucking show. She\u2019s the one female lead who\u2019s\u2026kind of strong. Sure she\u2019s madly in love with her brother, sure she\u2019s looking for love and cries about it; but she doesn\u2019t get kidnapped or become the damsel-in-distress  (like Asuna, Liz, Silica). She doesn\u2019t need to be saved except for that one little introduction to Leafa. If the brother love hadn\u2019t been there, I feel she would have been an excellent character. As she is, she\u2019s still pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nKirito, to his credit, gets to be a lot more bearable toward the end of the show, mostly due to the drama of the plot and tensions between the characters. The second-to-last episode and the first few minutes of the final episode, he\u2019s really fucking cool. I mean, he goes back to being boring as hell in the end, but I can commend that the writers were able to make the lamest character ever really awesome for a few minutes.\\n\\n\r\nI mention a lot of things that shouldn\u2019t be associated with this anime such as drama and good characters. Let me explain here why this half of the show works better than the first.\\n\\n\r\nThe bad guy.\\n\\n\r\nPlain and simple. A lot of people I\u2019ve talked to about the show give Sugou a lot of shit because he\u2019s the guy who licks Asuna\u2019s tears and sniffs her hair. But, the question is, doesn\u2019t that make you hate him? He\u2019s the kind of villain you want to see get his ass kicked. He\u2019s got a retarded, diabolical James Bond villain plan, he\u2019s feeling up the hero\u2019s girl like a sex doll, he\u2019s got a great evil laugh, he cries like a bitch when he gets hurt. He\u2019s fantastic. In the first half of the series there is a villain but we don\u2019t know him. He shows up at the beginning and at the end but nowhere in there do we see characterization. Nowhere can we say \u201cDamn, that guy is diabolical.\u201d He\u2019s just there to be the catalyst for a story. Hell, he even tells Kirito and Asuna he doesn\u2019t know why he did what he did, which is really weak story telling. But with Sugou, you understand why he\u2019s doing what he\u2019s doing; he wants the company president\u2019s daughter. He\u2019s batshit insane and he\u2019ll get what he wants no matter what.\\n\\n\r\nAnd this is why I enjoyed the second arc. I was invested in seeing this guy get his ass whooped (and boy, that was a good ass-whooping). I wasn\u2019t really invested in Asuna and Kirito getting back together, though the romance between them during this period was kind of sweet (then when they get back together it\u2019s as dull as ever). I was invested in the journey and the destination. The Aincrad arc didn\u2019t do that. It was too scatterbrained, didn\u2019t really have a concrete destination. That\u2019s why this arc worked so much better.\\n\\n\r\nIt was still stupid though. I can admit that. The random girls falling in love with Kirito, the game master from Sword Art Online giving Kirito control of the entire game, the exceptionally overlong epilogue that made the romance between Asuna and Kirito go from the emotional focal point of the plot to the emotional focal point of why I wanted to stop watching. The tentacle rape scene. The directorship, where the camera is focusing on girl\u2019s asses during emotional scenes rather than\u2026I don\u2019t know, the faces that show emotions?\\n\\n\r\nSo what can I say about Sword Art Online overall? It\u2019s bad on so many levels. The characters are (for the most part) bad, the plot is stupid, and it\u2019s full of idiotic moments and bad pacing. But, for all that, it\u2019s still entertaining on a dumb, popcorn-movie level. It has enough easily entertaining fight scenes, enough accessible characters, enough of a semblance of a plot, that it manages to keep you watching. The first arc is barely worth watching, to tell the truth, but it\u2019s still mildly entertaining. Alfheim Online is so much better though and picks the series off the ground, allowing it to at least crawl somewhere. It never stands up and walks or even runs, but at least there is some progress for nine episodes. Then it\u2019s back on it\u2019s ass going nowhere and wondering where it\u2019s at.\\n\\n\r\nIs the Alfheim arc worth watching? I think it\u2019s decent enough to give a watch. Is the series as a whole worth your time? I don\u2019t think so. If you\u2019re looking for dumb fun, you\u2019ve found it, but if you\u2019re looking for cohesion or any sort of finesse, you\u2019ll have to look elsewhere.",

            "content": "Quality != Popularity. Implying, or wrongly stating that it does is a fallacy. I will begin this affirming: SAO is bad, not because it's popular, because it's bad.  SAO has a really awful beginning that can't decide what to do with itself. It sets itself up as a Batsu game, but then never really expands on the subject, instead choosing to try and make it a grim and dark shounen, but that doesn't really work out either. It then tries being a mystery show, and was actually okay for the two episodes it tried, but that's all it accomplished.\r\nThe story starts picking up aroundthe middle of the first season where it goes off on this romantic story between two players, and the guild affairs of the game. Honestly, most of the first half of season one was literally just setting this up, regardless of all the plot holes and idiotic story design elements and bad pacing. So it's pretty good. And then the first season randomly ends before the game is finished. Oh, hey, I'm the final boss. Let's fight for no reason away from the last floor.. This would have been fine, except they clearly didn't know what to do with themselves at this point, because they immediately set up another poorly placed ridiculous storyline that almost mimics the conditions of the first season, except without any of the negative penalties. \"Oh no! Don't die or. . .you might be kinda. . .inconvenienced?\" There's nothing really at stake other than time, and the villain is laughably two dimensional.\\n\\n\r\nThere is nothing redeemable about SAO aside from the soundtrack and occasionally decent animation. It had potential but everything was wasted from the writing. \\n\\n\r\nYou can enjoy bad anime if you want, but do not try to act like it's actually good in any way. This is why SAO fans annoy me -- not because they like it, but because they think it's amazing in the face of all the glaring issues. They disregard valid complaints with \"well I found it fun!\" and only cherrypick the bad arguments instead of addressing the ones that matter. \\n\\n\r\nI can barely enjoy anything for the cute girls and the sexual appeal. SAO doesn't even have that. It's just a shell of a series that had potential but never utilized it. It's nothing more than a bad anime with good production values, and no matter how good the soundtrack and how flashy it looks, I cannot enjoy awful storytelling for those two aspects alone. Every time I feel like I'm about to enjoy the series, it goes right back to its problems due to the lack of talent from the writer. He tries so hard that it's actually embarrassing to watch.",

            "content": "Ah, Sword Art Online...you had so much potential.  I don't think there's a single one of us who read the synopsis for this series and said, \"That sounds boring.\"  Indeed, if it had been crafted better, this could have been one of the best anime of 2012.  Instead I feel it is a colossal waste.\r\nStory - 3/10 - After things get going, the first few episodes of the series are basically comprised of filler, which is never a good sign.  Kirito undertakes side quests that may as well be marked by a bright yellow exclamation point for how generic and dullthey are.  Most of the characters he meets are relatively interesting, until you realize that they never appear beyond the episode of their introduction.  What should be a time for gathering comrades and developing characters instead becomes a crazy, disjointed path that leaves the viewer wondering.  Time lapses are used frequently between episodes, because somehow there were even more trivial events which couldn't be shown on screen.\\n\\n\r\nSeason 1 redeems itself pretty well in the latter half in my opinion, which is when the series is at its best.  A cohesive story follows, and we're not meandering between useless might-as-well-be-NPC's anymore.  The ending of season 1 was truly satisfying, and if I could rate the entire series based on that, it would probably get about an 8.  Unfortunately however, we got a second season, and it never really takes flight (pun intended).  All of the momentum from season 1 is lost as the badass Kirito is transformed into a brooding weakling with a one-track mind, fighting a villain who is cartoonishly laughable in his demeanor and stupidity.  Yawn.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 2/10 - It's a harsh score, but honestly, Kirito and Asuna were the only interesting characters in the entire series, and they both got gutted by the time season 2 came around.  It's not that the supporting cast is unlikeable, but you're never given any time to get to know them.  The ones you do get to know are usually annoying or irrational.\\n\\n\r\nArt 5/10 & Sound 7/10 -  I'll preface this as always by saying that I am not a big art/sound guy.  I rate primarily on the other factors.  The animation was solid, but certainly not breathtaking.  It did a pretty good job of making you feel like you are in a generic fantasy world, which I think is what they were going for, actually, since it's an MMO.  The soundtrack itself is quite good, but the music never seemed to accent the dramatic moments in the series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 5/10 - I liked it mostly because of the premise being very unique, and the fact that it had some nice high points.  Though it may not seem like it, my score reflects optimism.  I will certainly be checking out the manga in hopes that this is just another anime series which can't echo its print version faithfully.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 4/10 - Given all 25 episodes to the first arc, I think this could have been a great series.  Action fans won't be disappointed (at first), and there's enough here for lovers of both anime and MMOs to grab onto.  Still, Sword Art Online is predictable, cliched, bland, and lacking any real depth.  It begins with a seductive whisper, but ends with a night of friendzone disappointment.",

            "content": "The anime everyone's heard about. The one that was all over tumblr, mentioned on facebook - it was everywhere for the time it was being shown. ...was it worth it? Yeah, not really at all it's a truly trashy series, but hey! It wasn't all bad! Except for the fact that that barely flippin' helps. At all.\r\nThe story of SAO is actually adequate at first. It pulls you in, it's interesting! That is, until the INFAMOUS third episode. Yes, this is not a certain other VRMMO (virtual reality mmo) show, but. The person who wrote SAO's novel, who had no IDEA of that other show,did write something at the same time. However, instead of turning this work in, they did not. So for all these years, how much does one have to revise? Exactly. Now, back to the anime's story. Yes, it's interesting. Up until the third episode where Sachi, a minor character, is killed. The main male lead, the protagonist, Kirito, does not react. A LIVING HUMAN WAS KILLED, and he did not care all that much. Yes, he was shocked. Was he saddened? No.\\n\r\nThere are a lot of emotional parts in SAO those are not bad. They can give you feels. However, there are so many fillers and strange aspects, that it all goes down the drain in the end, there's no lie there.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is a lot of things. It's \"high quality,\" but what about the style? Everyone looks a child, excluding a few characters. Everyone's face are blobby. Like moe-blobs, in a way. Their eyes are similar, big, and shiny. If you switched the girls' hairstyles and eye colors around, would you be able to recognize them? The animation's fluid, the effects are great, but the way everything is executed is not. All in all, it's above average, but not stupendous far from it.\\n\\n\r\nAh, the sound. The bgm is good! The songs? Lisa singing the opening... Now, Lisa is a great singer. Crossing Field, however, I can't say is a very good song. It's overrated at most and this is something I'm -really- gosh darn sure about. The future opening and endings are much better! However, that's personal opinion and music taste, so that's up to you. This is one of SAO's few saving graces.\\n\\n\r\nOh, Kirito. At first, an anti-social person. There's nothing wrong with that. He made mistakes. What about the rest of the series? No. After that, he is PERFECT. Every girl wants him, every guy wants to be him, the antagonists want him to badly suffer. He's depicted as THE best. Kirito becomes an actual 2D character in the personality and depiction part. Now, Asuna, his \"waifu.\" She is shown to be perfect, even more, than he is. She's the \"only\" one who can cook, everyone wants her, she's depicted as the most beautiful character in the entire series. At first, she can fight! She really can! Then, she becomes a damsel in distress, which isn't entirely her fault, but you know, strong female lead becomes... ??? She's also not the only girl who can cook, but that's what people think. Everyone forgets that she's portrayed as the most perfect girl you could be in the world of SAO. ...making these two THE strongest in this anime ruins nearly everything. Of course they'll win sooner or later.\\n\r\nOne of the later antagonists becomes enamored with Asuna. Before they can leave the game, an older man tries to take Asuna from Kirito, because she's stuck in another VRMMO. Yes, that's right. He violates her in front of Kirito, so he'll get angry. Yepp. Some random guy just decides to do this. The characters? Nice try, but not really.\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment of this series... I honestly thought I'd like it, I really did. That all fell apart early on. I enjoyed the emotional bits, the fluid-ness of the animation, the action scenes, the effects. The story was no, the art style was no, the characters definitely not. There you have it. A not so enjoyable experience, that could've gone right. Maybe, honestly.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, SAO gets pretty much a 3 from me. Notable, but not note-worthy to watch. At. All. I apologize to all fans, but this just wasn't my idea of an amazing anime. Thanks a bunch for reading, though!",

            "content": "Now I know you will take one look at the score I have given it and will automatically think \"this is just gonna be another hater review. *ignores review* or *clicks not helpful* Just read the next paragraph. If you agree with it, read a bit more and if you get bored then you can leave. If you don't agree then click not helpful and get on with your life.\r\nIf my hunch is right, then at least 50% of the anime community are also gamers. And I bet every single one of them has gotten into some sort of mmorpg before. I have. So Ican say safely that most of the anime community can relate to Kirito. And Kirito is literally, the perfect gamer. He is not obese, does not live in his mothers basement (I am just pointing out stereotypes sorry if I offend anybody), great at gaming and can pick up chicks in game like they are pokemon. And that people, is how this show hooked so many people.  By making a male lead the viewers dream life that is actually somewhat realistic.\\n\\n\r\nGoing more into the review now. What makes this show that makes haters hate so much yet makes people love it so much. I'm just gonna give some major points now.\\n\\n\r\nThe Good:\\n\r\n-Great Action\\n\r\n-Amazing art and sound\\n\r\n-The amazing world of SAO\\n\r\n-The \"Romance\"\\n\\n\r\nThe Bad:\\n\r\n-The Characters\\n\r\n-The Timeskips\\n\r\n-Progression of story does not do what it says on the tin\\n\r\n-The \"Romance\"\\n\\n\r\nAs I do my review I will try to cover and explain all these points. And remember, this is all personal opinion. Don't rage or anything if you're reading this.\\n\\n\r\nStory-5\\n\r\nEverybody in the anime community know the story. I don't need to explain it. At first glance the story seems fine. But after the first 2 episodes, everything goes downhill. From episode 2 to 3, there is massive timeskip. Everybody is level 20-ish more and Kirito is double their level. When I watched this questions aroused like \"How is Kirito double their level?\" or \"Was there anything important that happened on the other floors?\". But that is one timeskip in a pool of many. The other big problem I found was that the story set itself up as some grand quest and struggle for survival in the first 2 episodes. After that, all I saw was Kirito helping out some girls then getting married and focusing on his love life for the rest of the SAO arc. Call me blind if you must, but I think I am not the only one with that opinion. Then we have the Alfheim arc (I think I spelled it right). Long story short. It was shit. I barely understood what was the point in making that arc. There was no danger to it anymore. I could rant for a lot longer but I will stop now. Hopefully you get my message about both arcs.\\n\\n\r\nArt-10\\n\r\nThis probably doesn't deserve a perfect score. But I will cut it some slack. Not to say it was bad or anything, quite the opposite. The character designs (except for Suguha) were really well drawn, the world of SAO and to a lesser extent Alfheim online looks amazing, the action scenes were well choreographed and the boss battles always had me cheering \"Haul some ass guys!!!!\". I'm 100% sure that 50% of the anime community knows about the awsome art and animation of SAO. And I will say, it lives up to it's hype.\\n\\n\r\nSound-8\\n\r\nI don't remember much about the sound. Not because it sounds bad but it has been a while since I watched this and I don't plan on re-watching this or watching the second season. But the biggest question that comes in my mind when I think about sound or more specifically music in SAO is \"Does Crossing Field by LiSA live up to it's hype?\" Yes it's really good, but it's a little overhyped. (Personal opinion if you disagree with it; good for you, have a cookie.) That is all I can say about the sound because I don't remember any of the ED's or the other OP and I can't remember the background music.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-4\\n\r\nNow this is the part of SAO that I find really falls flat on it's face. Kirito is literally just one of those big face cut-out things that you put your face in. He is the perfect character and that is all we see him as. Then we have Asuna. She first appeared as some badass heroine but turned into a \"damsel in distress\" character and was completely useless later on without Kirito around. I found no character development within the series. I will give this anime the trophy for maybe the first to have \"character regression\" as in the opposite of character development. There was \"romantic\" development but I also found it so forced and rushed. I'm sorry people but I had to say it. This \"shining\" point in this series is what I found one of the worst. What I saw was a really stereotypical or more accurately a generic love story. Boy meets girl, they hang out, go on a \"date\", then they get married...wut? I can rant about this forever. But I think I made my point. Wait I forgot some characters. Suguha: incest is not wincest. The other two girls in Kirito's harem: they only appeared in 2 episodes. Cant say much other than they are useless without Kirito around.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-4\\n\r\nI'll be honest. As terrible as I am making this sound. (And I probably did switch o pure hater review some time along the way) I did enjoy it to an extent. There was only 4-ish episodes that did not involve anybody swinging a sword at some type of boss, and those 4-ish episodes were the really terrible ones. The other episodes were worth watching for the epic boss fights or any sort of duel that happened. Now this does not include the Alfheim arc. If I were to rate the SAO ar and Alfheim arc then SAO would get a 6 while Alfheim gets a 1. Alfheim was just mind-numbingly pointless. If you want to know my thoughts, then google \"problems with SAO second half\" then click on any blog and read the hate comments. Those are my thoughts.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-4\\n\r\nObviously you might be thinking \"the scores don't add up. A 5, 10, 8 and two 4's shouldn't get a medium of 4.\" And yes it should be something like a 5 or 6. What's stopping it. All the scores was mostly based on SAO. This score and the last also included Alfheim. Which severely brought it down. I'll be honest. The studio could have just extended the SAO arc to all 25 episodes. Then that could have made for a lot less timeskips, and perhaps actually fleshed out the characters. But apparently the manga got cut halfway through so they cut the SAO arc short  just threw in the Alfheim arc. I don't know if this is true, I have checked but didn't get any answers.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "This quite possibly the most insulting Anim\u00e9 I've ever watched, and I've watched a fair few in my days.  But lets start out with the good stuff, the art direction and sound direction is really good, while it doesn't look amazing I have not once felt like any of it was immersion breaking or out of place for that matter. The animators and the voice actors did a good job one and they keep doing so as the series progress, wich takes us to the things that doesn't.\r\nI will say this, the first episode is great. It's a 9/10. Good Pacing, it's funny whenit needs to be funny and it introduces a very intresteing concept for an anime and it really captures the feeling of a MMO. Sadly however they had to go and make more episodes. Straight of the bat the second episode destroys any kind of tention set up in the first one, apparently beating levels in this game is something you do off-screen and you do so at an extremly rapid pace and then the characters hit us.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a 14 year olds wet dream, being a god in a MMO picking up chicks right, left and center. It's as if they were created by someone that really hates games and gamers, it's a parody of what gamers wish they could be. \\n\\n\r\nThe main character is socialy akward, introvert and does not like taking up alot of space, while in real life these would by most be called shy or if by some mean-spirited person, Anti-social. \\n\\n\r\nHow does this anime portray these character traits? It means you're a badass loner, an enigma to the girls and the envy of the boys. The reason he doesn't join groups and guilds isn't because he has a hard time forming social relationships, it's because he is so good at the game that he doesn't need to. \\n\\n\r\nSo basicly what you have a is a superman, badass loner with a softside saving damsels in distress... And he does so in zones he is way to high level to be in.  \\n\\n\r\nFor those that doesn't know, this is an episodical Anime, there is no overacring plot but each week our superbadass mega ultra hero, gets a new girl that he has to save, and she will turn out to pretty much fall for him everytime. He is so overleveled for the zones that he runs around in that even 100 people fit to be in that zone would probably have a really hard time bringing him down. And because of the implications of a mmo, it's very lucky for our hero that everyone was forced to look like their real life selves in game, or one of the many many girls he tries to white knight in this series could have turned out to be 45 year old man, and we can't have that. \\n\\n\r\nThat is all this anime is a glorfied wet dream in a 14 year old boys head. \\n\r\nThis series had so much potential, but it wasted it away on  pandering what people that don't play games, thinks gamers want to be like. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime has managed to insult me not only as anime audience, but as a gamer and a man aswell. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, really great first episode but on a whole a very bad anime. Someone wrote down the wet dreams he had during puberty and made them into a Anime.",

            "content": "A genre of a RPG/MMPORG seems pretty okay. Driving this in media is pretty fine. It sounded pretty absurd, how about that? When I heard about SAO, I thought it sounded pretty good because it had to with a video game. But, the first episode was pretty boring in my opinion. It really didn't excite me. I was disappointed, very. The fog of this, I didn't drop the anime because a lot of anime are like that. Boring, but then they get better. It's hard to explain what I felt after watching some more episodes. My despise started, that's how I can describe in thissense. And it's because of the way it was rushed into episode 2. Horrible and not absurd, but when an anime starts out absurd: I like it. Because it's illogical at first, but then logic comes. SAO is not anything like that in my opinion. It's pretty much nothing after the first episode. Here is my reasoning right here, SAO did not come to it's full potential. It had a lot, despite some boring parts and episodes. Yet, I'm going more solely based on another thing. But, first the reasons of my ''absurd'' logic. \\n\\n\r\nI didn't like the rushing of the anime, I've said that above. And here are some things. Kirito and Asuna got married pretty quickly, and basically I say they fell in love in rush mode, they fell in love pretty fast. What I thought the anime was going to be like was a bad-ass action-adventure with a great plot. But, SAO didn't have any of that. The action was stale, not much adventure in it, and no great plot well because it was very rushed into. Besides the dumb romance, all this makes no sense in the anime because they could just fall in love slowly. Still, it was horrible to put the romance in it. It was not the character's fault. It was the creator's fault for this. I would never blame an anime character or any other character for such fathom. And the next it that it rushes the fights pretty quick if you think about it. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime is very predictable. Kirito and Oberon are the worst parts, when they en guarde. At that time, Kirito had the ability to erase him, but he didn't. He just battled him. That's pretty dumb. But, it's pretty mutual that Kirito had that ability. He basically just wanted revenge. Episode 24 was the worst episode in my opinion. And Kirito and the GM, very many people would agree. And I do too. What the heck. But, the plot-holes are worst.  \\n\\n\r\nKayaba Akihiko didn't cover all the plot holes. The GM plot as I mentioned, was horrible. 31/10/2022[SAO game comes out] >forward to Episode 4, it's 24/02/2024. And on episode 2, they should have not survived if they had no food nor water. They should be dead! GM plot sucks. SAO is very BS.  Not to be rude to the fans or anything. \\n\\n\r\nI hope you liked it and thanks for reading.",

            "content": "tl;dr The entire problem with SAO is the adaptation. They are rushing through this far too quickly, which results in this being a pretty bad series. I hope they find their stride and recover after a time.\r\nEDIT: For some reason the review is still showing me at 1 of ?. I'm currently caught up.\r\nSTORY (6): Solid story, but the details aren't being developed very well. There's very little world building, and I'm left to assumed that the things they pull out of nowhere are actual components of this world. It doesn't draw me in on any level more than a basic fight-for-survival story, and eventhat it does poorly thanks to Character.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (5): The director and writer seriously have no idea what they are doing. Killing off a character and then spending the rest of the episode trying to make me feel bad about it isn't the effective way to go about things. The character development is very poorly timed and lacking when it does show up.\\n\\n\r\nART (8): Good, but nothing spectacular. No Fate/zero.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (8): Good, but nothing spectacular.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: (6) It looks cool, sounds cool, but fails at the ultimate task of drawing me in and experiencing the world with the characters. I really don't feel the drama and emotion they are trying to make me feel, which is entirely due to the poor pacing.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Ya there!\r\nThis is my first time reviewing and the scoring is personal. So it's not surprising if your score with mine is different. By the way my english is not that good either so I hope you understand that. Well, whatever..\r\nSo here it goes!\r\nSAO(aka Sword Art Online) one of the most loved and hated at the same times in 2012 era. With that being said, SAO is actually not that bad or at least not as bad as the haters said, BUT SAO is without a doubt is not as great as people said either. \r\nWhy?\r\nLet's talk about it here.\r\n-STORY- (6)\r\nWe have our main character(KirigayaKazuto aka Kirito) one of the few beta tester(which is not really important soon) play and then trapped in a game called SAO. And then the game creator said that the player must clear the 100th floor and defeat the final boss on the game to survive, with dying on the game lead you to death in the real world.\\n\\n\r\nThe concept of the story is great and the potential for this anime to be a great and unique anime is huge, but the execution of it for the rest of the episodes is bad. The most disappointed part of the story(for me) is that the author is not making use of the concept effectively, instead the author end up make a cheap romance relationship with a few shown development.\\n\\n\r\nBut I believe it's totally decent for most viewers. It's not great doesn't mean it's bad.\\n\r\nSo give it a try folks.\\n\\n\r\n-ART-(7.6)\\n\r\nI don't find the art unique, it's great and the animation is fluid but that's all. Most anime nowadays is better or as good as SAO. \\n\r\nThough with that being said the art fit the anime greatly.\\n\\n\r\n-SOUND-(7)\\n\r\nAs for the Sound, I just personally don't like the OP and ED so I give it 7.\\n\r\nIt's OST is great though, as you can expect from Yuki Kajiura.\\n\r\nI don't know many voice actor but they're doing good.\\n\r\nIt's probably 8 for most people.\\n\\n\r\n-CHARACTERS-(4)\\n\r\nThis is the worst part of SAO for me. I'm quite sensitive when it's about character development, so it won't be surprising if I 'kind-of-insult' it a bit.\\n\\n\r\nI don't understand for people who's saying that SAO's character is deep. The story is rushing too much at some point, so there's no space for character development. All we know is that:\\n\r\nKirito go help many people.\\n\r\nKirito Lvl up without any process.\\n\r\nKirito got the ideal girl(and harem) easily.\\n\r\nMost female characters fall for Kirito without any realistic reason.\\n\\n\r\nI'll begin with our MC first.\\n\r\nKirito's development is the most poor one. He's like totally created to be the ideal form of guy without any process, and that's the worst way to use main character effectively.\\n\r\nAsuna's development is poor too. At first she's a cool solo beautiful female character, but end up becoming a 'easy to get' girl and totally weak character, and again it's happening because lack of character development. what a let down. \\n\r\nI personally find Suguha(2nd arc)'s development is the most decent one. but again with a few development close to none Suguha's arc(ALO) is looks so stupid to me.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the other characters. Most of them show in each episode related to them and then thrown as if their purpose is to show how badass Kirito is.\\n\r\nSo I end up don't remember the other characters anymore.\\n\\n\r\nThat should've been a strong prove enough to show that SAO's character development is poor here.\\n\\n\r\n-ENJOYMENT-(5)\\n\r\nI personally don't enjoy SAO.\\n\r\nBut I think SAO's quite enjoyable actually, only if you don't think the depth of it that is.\\n\\n\r\n-OVERALL-(6.4)\\n\r\nSAO's not that bad, actually it's good. It's just disappointing that a great potential anime is poorly written.\\n\r\nSo, there're few problems why SAO is disappointing for me:\\n\r\nIt's concept is great but not used effectively.\\n\r\nThe character development(again) is so poor.\\n\r\nThe Author is throwing too many female character that was end up fall for Kirito which leads to harem-ish condition.\\n\\n\r\nIf you seek a easy to understand and not so in depth story with a great animation. SAO's a good choice without a doubt. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nSo,I believe it's not hurt for you people to give it a try.\\n\r\nit's worth watching.",

            "content": "I can see why so many people hate this anime. In fact, I sometimes wonder why I even liked it so much. After giving it some thought, I've come to a conclusion. SAO haters, let me explain to you guys why so many (including me) liked this BLATANTLY BAD anime.\r\nAs I look back on SAO, the story was pretty bad. The one dimensional main character shits on everyone. A harem was built in two episodes to be left without further development for the entire series. The main girl, a fierce-tsundere-turned-helpless-princess has no development either, apart from being raped a couple times. WHY did i likethis then? WHY are there so many SAO fanboys (like me) who give this anime endless, seemingly undeserved praise?\\n\\n\r\nLook at it from our perspective. Most of us are gamers, bad at socializing, so we isolate ourselves in our gaming/anime worlds. Without girlfriends.\\n\\n\r\nTHen comes along Kirito, who perfectly fits in our mold: gamers, bad with people, without girlfriends. And this guy-- hes a badass. He shits on everyone, his dick is a vagina-magnet, and he defies the admins because hes a badass, and thats just how it works.\\n\\n\r\nAsuna is the seemingly perfect girlfriend. THough she has ZERO character development, she: 1. is hot 2. is an awesome gamer too who 3. also needs saving like a damsel in distress and 4. MAKES KIRITO SANDWICHES. Come on, every guy wants a girlfriend who he can say \"make me a sandwich\" to. So while to you, cultured anime watchers who can see through these 4 points, Asuna is a walking pile of cliches, to us fanboys she is PERFECT. SHE MAKES SANDWICHES. PERFECT.\\n\\n\r\nSo, back to my point: SAO is a people pleaser. Though it has good art and sound, it has a bad storyline, bad characters, too many cliches. But it's still a people pleaser. And it pleases lots of people (like me). We are nerds who don't know any better and fall into the role of Kirito--who, due to his one- dimensional nature, anyone can fit as. We fall in love with the pile of cliches, we enjoy our undeveloped harem, and we watch as Kirito shits on everyone. And in the end, we enjoy the anime, worship it on forums, argue with the haters... etc.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, SAO is a blatant people pleaser. As an anime noob, I fell for it, like the other fanboys, i enjoyed it, and it became one of my favorites. The more experienced anime watchers saw the cliches, wondered \"why the fuck do these people worship SAO???\", posted their valid opinions, and were labeled the \"haters\". Here lies the controversy in Sword art Online.",

            "content": "When i first heard about SAO I thought this series has great potential and could be reall enjoyable. Soo i went on to watch the first couple of episodes, they were actually great and gave a good introduction as too what was expected of the show. The series even had an awesome female lead with great combat skills. \r\nHowever, thats where the enjoyment stopped. From then on the show just went down hill and gave you your basic OP guys with tons of chicks falling for him, and this includes the lead girl. There was no chaacter development and hardly any fights with the bossesthey needed to defeat on each level, leading to me being very dissapointed. I expected this to be a great series in which it was a fight for survival, defeating each boss as they came. This unfortunately was the complete opposite. \\n\\n\r\nWithout giving too many spoliers I will just say, if your looking for an awesome fighting series to watch then don't bother with this. This series is mainly a haram romance and some fighting sequences, that come across quite boring and short. Your main character is very 1 dimentional and bland. You also never really see the dire need for their survial with the characters. It sometimes looks like they are contempt with their situation. Hence the lack of fight scenes with the bosses. \\n\\n\r\nOverall the series was a major dissappointment. And I dont even want to get started on how the other half of the episodes went.",

            "content": "Sword Art Online reviews on this website are a dime a dozen on this website now a days, but screw it... here goes nothing\r\nWhat is good about it? The animation is very colorful and nice to look at. The first little bit of Sword introduces us to modern day Japan, which gave me a feeling of dread in the color pallets that were used, maybe  because the colors in the beginning were real dull to symbolize how dull and heartless the world is sometimes. Once Kirito enters the realm of Aindecrad (or however you spell it ) we are introduced to vibrant colors thatstay consistent through the series. Aindcrad is the kind of world in an anime that i wouldn't mind living in. There are scenes in episodes 7-9 or something like that (its been a while since i have seen this show) where Kirito and a significant other find serenity via a log cabin, by the lake, by a water fall, full of wildlife, in the middle of nowhere, on floor 22 (maybe). That sort of place is the kind of place i could retire and die happy living in. \\n\\n\r\nThe music in Sword Art Online is easily the best thing about the series (aside from the Kirito, Assuna Sub-arc) which is done by Yuki Kajiura. As good as Yuki's music is, i cant help that she has had the shit end of the stick as far as composing music for terrible anime goes (yes including this one), but i can happily say that she also did the music for a much Superior series than this one series, Fate/Zero.\\n\\n\r\nYou can probably guess from the score of this review where this is going. Whats wrong with the show?\\n\\n\r\nSword Art Online features an amazing premise. A TV that puts the main characters into a real life MMORPG Death game! You'd think that would make for some real good television right? WRONG! Every anime I've seen has done it wrong so far (no I haven't seen Log Horizon yet). With the exception of the Kirito x Asuna Arc, the story is fruitless, and full of stupid things that happen because the plot demanded it to happen, without trying to be subtle about it. I can't put my finger on how and why this show became such a bore as well. The random stories that happen through the massive time skip try to be interesting and different in a series like this, but a lot of things beyond those are a real bore, even the fight scenes sometimes. I mentioned that the animation was good in this show, but to a certain extent. The animation for the fight scenes are overly flashy and after a while, felt all too family from the fight scene before it. But undoubtedly the most boring thing about this show is the second half. It's nice that the episodes are featuring actual continuity finally, but was there any point? The show's second half was void of almost any plot and was downright dreadful to watch. I had a hard time keeping myself awake when i powered through the last 13 episodes in that one after noon, and this is coming from someone who stayed awake til 2am powering through the nauseatingly fast paced show, Kill La Kill,. As boring as that was, it still wasn't as boring as .hack/Sign, which is also a show about an RPG Death Game (you don't need to watch that show either.\\n\\n\r\nHow is the protagonist? Kirito is an awful protagonist. There were 10,000 people in Sword Art Online that got trapped in Aindrad and they chose Kirito to revolve around. Kirito lacks personality, and is way too overpowered of a character. \">But Gaddafi he's powerful because he grinded his skills hard and went on dungeon raids and maxed out his skills because he's so good at MMOs.\" I find it hard to believe in a game genre that encourages team play, because of how insanely hard raids and progression in MMOs can be, that he by himself became a level, that him so powerful that his health regenerates faster than he takes damage, without dying, in episode 3, on floor 15? They could have at least made it believable. What is with girls hitting on Kirito all the time? I could understand an anime character like Kamina from Gurren Lagann getting all the girls, but Kirito looks like a little turd and acts super emo all the time.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMy biggest beef with this series in the way that it is structured. Before this series was an anime, it was a first a light novel. As far as I know, the Ancrade Arc, the first 12 or 13 episodes of the series were written in two books. One was the main *cough* story arc, and the second was a book that featured a bunch of random stories that happens between the ridiculuos time skips that happen early in the first arc. Instead of only having the random story episodes happen in OVA episodes, and the actually story arc take place in the main series, they tried to squish both novels into the first 12 episodes and it doesn't work at all. Ghost In The Shell: Stand Alone Complex does the same idea, where Stand Alone Episodes exist between main story episodes, none of the Stand Alone episodes even make an attempt to have relevance to the overarching plot line or tie into it somehow. And that is just the first half..... The second half is utterly pointless perverted, it drags out for way too long, and serves as an excuse for make the series painfully longer.\\n\\n\r\nThe worst of all, by the way, is the amount of exposition in the show. Exposition isn't bad, as long as it is done in a way that keeps the viewer interested; characters sitting at a cafe talking is NOT interesting by any means. I think i counted at least 10 times that they sat at a cafe, or cafe like scenario to deliver exposition. One of my friends took a screenwriting course, and was telling him about, and he said that: one of the first things they teach you, is that delivering exposition via sitting at a coffee table, cafe whatever is unacceptable in screen writing. I saw the first episode of SAO2, and that was exactly what turned me off to watching the second series. They didn't learn anything from this mess of a show. The first episode featured exposition that made up of 13-22 minutes of its run time. That's enough Sword Are Online for me. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending made me upset as well.\\n\\n\r\nI give the first half a 4/10, \\n\r\nwhile i give the second half a 1/10\\n\\n\r\nI give it 2 tentacle rape scenes out of 10 naked girls on Kirito's bed chambers\\n\r\nYou don't need to see this show.\\n",

To the point that it no longer is a real story so much as just a stage to play out preteen fantasies. Its quite embarasing, and it strongly reeks of the \"chuunibiyo/eight grader syndrome\". You have a hero who is super special and always has a super advantage with his super equipment and never loses because he has super special abilities.It's cringe worthy. As for this arcs damsel in distress direction, it isn't the worst plot but it is a cliche of cliches.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: When I first started watching this show, I thought \"Okay, we have some asocial kid here, but through trials and turbulations he will develop as a character, etc\". Not quite what happened. He just suddenly became outgoing and talkative.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and the sound are average.\\n\\n\r\nThis series was thoroughly unenjoyable and I recommend it to anyone with poor taste.\\n",

            "content": "While this anime isn't perfect, it sure as hell isn't no where near as bad as what people have been saying and expressing in their reviews. It's not the perfect anime that some people make it out to be either, but NO anime is perfect in that regard.\r\nStory- The story isn't something unique, the whole \"If you die in the game, you die in real life\" scenario has been done before, but does not having a unique story make it any less impactful or good? The answer is no, take a look at something like clannad where the story in a sense is very generic,boy meets girl, they fall in love, and then something tragic happens. Certainly not a unique story at all, but look at how impactful it was, I've honestly never been that torn up over something in my entire life. What makes a story good is not necessarily being unique, but rather how the story impacts you. Will you remember these characters or certain scenes months or even years down the road? Will it be something that impacts you in a certain way, or make you realize something about yourself? The answer is yes to all of these questions. Don't get me wrong, this anime has plenty of faults, and it pains me to say that because this anime could have easily been a 10/10 and made it's way into my top 5. It had so much going for it, and yet it felt extremely rushed in the first couple of episodes, some characters weren't around long enough to even care about, even when certain scenes made it clear that you were suppose to care. It's hard to care for a character when you've really only had an episode or so to get to know them, it's certainly alot less impactful in certain areas than what it was suppose to be. Then in other areas it's extremely impactful and has done things that I personally haven't ever seen done in an anime, a few scenes in particular. This is why i'm so on the fence about this anime, some scenes were so wonderfully done, and other scenes fell extremely short of what they were going for. Even with it's faults this anime is still an 8/10 for me, at the beginning it was registering about a 4/10 for me, but then the anime picked up and really started showing it's charm, how amazing it could be and just how much potential it had. I was definitely happy watching this anime and it was certainly not a waste of time like most people seem to say it is. After the first couple of episodes of this anime and the way things seem to be going you might have a general idea of where things are going, and you couldn't be more wrong. It's alot more morbid than you would first believe, and the ending scene of the \"first season\" just shows how morbid of an anime this can be at times. It also a very romantic anime, it one of the best couples I've seen in a long time. The story starts off slow, then really starts to pick up after the first couple of episodes, and I mean really pick up. It's a wonderful, yet morbid and sometimes loving story that I think people look over because of it's very obvious faults at the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nArt-The art style is really good for the most part. All of the weapons, armor, and environment seem very much like something that you would find in a traditional mmo. All of the fight scenes are animated very well, nothing more to really say.\\n\\n\r\nSound-The musical scores hit where they are suppose to, whether it be fast paced music for fight scenes, or something soothing and mellow for a sweet scene. The opening and closing songs are really quite catchy and match the atmosphere of the anime very well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- The characters are really well done, for the most part at-least. As I said in the story section, some of the characters aren't well fleshed out all that well, it's not that they where wrote badly or anything, you just didn't get to know them at all. You can't really feel any sort of emotion towards someone you know hardly anything about. The main characters however are done really well. Kirito and asuna in specific are wrote very well. You see them grow throughout the anime and learn from their mistakes. Their personalities even change for the better and they grow as humans. They seem very organic and very much alive for fictional characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-My overall enjoyment at the beginning was very minimum, besides the first episode. The first episode really draws you in, but then it gets very jumpy the next couple of episodes and makes it feel like you where missing whole out on alot. It even feels like some episodes where missing or something. After a rocky start things start to pick up, and it starts really showing off it's charm, and naturally you start enjoying yourself more. It had really enjoyable fighting scenes, and really touching emotional scenes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-Overall this anime could have been alot better, but at the same time it was alot better than I had originally though it would be. The way people are writing and talking about it make it seem like it's one of the worst things ever composed, almost like it's an abomination that should not be seen by human eyes, for fear of blindness. Sure it had some issues here and there, but overall it's a very well done (albeit rushed in some parts) anime. It had some really emotional and rather awesome scenes that I will definitely remember for years to come. Some of the scenes with kirito and asuna are just amazing, I don't see how people can talk so bad about it after witnessing such scenes. It might not have been perfect, but it definitely was a overall well done and entertaining anime. If you are wanting to watch a really good action anime, with a rather unique romance side to it then I reccomend this to you. You definitely won't be disappointed.",

            "content": "I will update the review once the anime is finished, or when the anime gets to an interesting point/development\r\nSword art online is probably the most anticipated anime in this summer season, and it maybe the best in my opinion. Although there are a lot of critics saying that the anime is no where as good as the light novel series, but with 25 episodes its hard to focus on everything especially if the novel is up to its 10th volume, but who knows there might be a season 2.\r\nStory 8\r\nThe story follows Kirigaya Kazuto with his game alias \"Kirito,\" a \"solo\" player that was partof the beta in the game and his journey to clear the 100 floors, being part of the squad that is always on the front lines he is well known, and is called the black swordsman due to his clothes. His adventure leads him to meet many different kind of people, each one changing a bit of Kirito maybe in the future he would no longer be a solo player? i'll have to wait and see=P. \\n\\n\r\nThere are massive leaps in the time line such as in the first 2 episodes their like on floor 1 or 2, but in the 3rd episode there on 20 something? and Kirito is around level 40. It makes it really confusing  because you don't really know what happened between, it would have been cool to show Kirito levelling to be honest, seeing it will probably remind the days of when i was levelling on a MMO. plus the fact that they don't continue on after each episode kinda sucks coz theres none of that cliff hanger feeling =/ but i guess i haven't exactly finished the anime yet so who knows it might occur in the future its only just begun, but i heard that the massive time leaps happen in the light novel as well. Although only side stories has only been released, the fact that i find them pretty good already hopefully the main story will be amazing as well. \\n\\n\r\nBut to be honest what i think makes this story amazing its how you don't really get bored when your watching the episode or at least you don't lose attention, it constantly engages you, its kinda the feeling you get when watching Full metal alchemist brotherhood where you cant help but keep on watching.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8\\n\\n\r\nBeing released in 2012 it'll be surprising if the animation was bad. The character designs are very well done in this, the female characters kinda remind of some characters from guilty crown such as Asuna quite similar to inori as in the face not the hair style and stuff. The background is absolutely amazing, with so much detail, looking at some of the background will truly astonish you. The fight scenes are pretty cool, although there is little magic or skills involved despite this being a MMORPG, you only get to hear the skill name you don't really see it in action, the sword fights are pretty cool i think there pretty well animated i like the way when people disappear they kinda disintegrate, plus i like the way the monster/players are cut as well and i like what they do with the menu really makes it feel like a game.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9\\n\\n\r\nThe opening is pretty well done, the song is pretty catchy and is sang by LiSA who i find pretty good, she did the opening and ending for Angel Beats! and the Girls Dead Monster songs she also sang the opening for Fate/Zero. The opening video hardly spoils anything only showing characters and very little bits of fight scenes unlike some anime opening video's which spoil a lot for you like Shakugan no Shana... I quite like the OST in this anime, it really set the mood in some of the sad scenes/fight scenes it draws your attention more towards it. Especially the fight scenes it makes it more exciting to watch, and its one of those things where when you hear the OST again you will remember the scene.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9\\n\\n\r\nI quite like the characters in SAO, Kirito is your typical lone wolf that when something bad happens he takes it really personally, in real life he didn't really socialise much with the outside world, so being in a game that completely reflects your life its kinda hard for him to interact with other players in the game. Probably one of the reason why he is a \"solo player\" although not the only reason, other reason include bad experiences during the game, such as deaths and etc. Although it's pretty interesting to watch when he helps people out despite being a solo player.\\n\\n\r\nAsuna is one of the few pretty girls in SAO and to be honest a girl in an MMO is not very common, she also fights in the front lines aswell, with the title \"flash\" that she gained due to her skill lighting fast attacks. Her personality provides plenty of comical moments, she's basically an innocent teenager, that gets easily embarrassed when topics around relationships come up or when embarrassing things happen, you can probably image what kind of comical scenes will come up cant you =P. I think SAO focuses on the relationship between Asuna and Kirito, although its not completely clear yet as only 6 episodes are out, i am definitely a fan of Kirito X Asuno =P. \\n\\n\r\nI'm not completely sure if the characters currently introduced are side or main characters due to the fact that they only appeared once, but each female character seems to basically fall for Kirito and affects his mental state somehow whether in a positive or negative way.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9 \\n\\n\r\nFor me personally this Anime really pulls me in, I really like each fight scene that occurs, especially the ones where Kirito is basically completely overpowering every monster/player. The side stories are pretty good, even though there sides it feels like they play a big role in the main story in terms of character development. Each time there's a romance development between Asuna and Kirito I get really excited, they haven't really done much yet but I really want them to be together they work so well together =P. Its kinda similar to the feeling i get when Touma and Misaka from To Aru Majutsu no Index have romance developments xD.I can't really comment on the Main story yet as it hasn't actually started yet =/\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9 \\n\\n\r\nCurrently I am absolutely loving SAO mainly because of the fact that its an anime about an MMORPG =P, it has everything that you can ask for from a fantasy action adventure anime. I think everything is done to a high standard, and theres not much you can ask for except maybe less time leaps and more character development but the anime just started so theres not much i can ask for. This is the view point of someone who hasn't read the light novel so i can't really compare the 2, but I heard that the anime doesn't follow the light novel completely or leaves little bits out? who knows even without reading the light novel i think this is still pretty good. Hopefully with episodes about the main story starting soon SAO will become even better and maybe become of those unforgettable animes such as Clannad or Code Geass.",

            "content": "P.S (Pre-Scriptum): In general I don't write anime reviews. Actually, I don't write any at all, but something about the reception that this release has received so suddenly brings it to my attention, and not in a good way.\r\nStory (8): The story and premise in general are very good and in fact unique, it leaves a lot of room for expansion and opportunity and also draws in the audience. The protagonist is a teenage boy who beta tests and becomes immersed in a new MMORPG release titled \"Sword Art Online\" (SAO). The scene is in the future where video game technology has progressed with newhardware called \"nervegear\" a physical attachment that allows players to become fully physically immersed into the video game, allowing for more realistic combat, interactions, etc. All well and good. So far at least. The first 10,000 players that receive the release are trapped inside by the ominous game-maker who states that leaving and/or dying within the game results in a real life death for the player, and that the only way to escape is to complete the game by clearing all 100 floors of Aincrad, the main MMO city, and beating the final boss. You would think that in the future where such video game production quality is available that a designer could come up with a better game progression system than a layered dungeon. Come on.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7): Not much much to say in this respect. Lots of vibrant colors and a good landscape design for the world of Aincrad. The art is pretty standard and similar to that of other releases currently.\\n\\n\r\nSound (6): Here's where I can be a bit picky. The BGM is okay, nothing that stands out, and the OP/EDs are the typical boring upbeat Jpop bullshit. Been there done that. I just wish that every anime could have great OP/EDs like Tatami Galaxy, Gurren Lagann, Zetsubou Sensei, to name a few.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (3): This is where the entire anime falls in quality. The main character is un-relatable, lacks emotion, and is just good at everything and lacks any physical or mental flaws. The writing also makes his decision making hard to understand and leaves the audience bored. He meets another player, who is magically the most beautiful and skilled and has about as much to say or do as Bella from Twilight. Nothing. Then you have the actions of the rest of the players. You would think that with your life on the line you would at least try to stay alive, but no. The leader of their first expedition to the first floor decides to throw his life away for no discernible reason, when he was offered the choice to survive at no cost, he instead chooses to give up his entire life, worth, and meaning. Great job writers, great job. Then the main character after being named a hero and all that shit, turns into a huge dick and sneers at the rest of the players, declaring his dominance and their inferiority. He goes on to talk about how he is a cheater and a hacker (with no evidence to back it up). And goes out strutting his pompous ass, without a single explanation or care from the writers.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7): As with all shounen/action genre releases, the anime is well paced and won't leave you hanging at drawn-out slow bits, but the enjoyment of the action is broken with consistent contradictions and more plot holes than you could count.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (5): With such a quick growth of fans and 10/10 ratings/reviews, you would expect more from this release, but that is something an intelligent viewer just can't do. Many would just take a look at the surface art/story premise and call it good, but few would take the moments to delve into the behaviors of the characters and the shape of the story, to see where all of the great issues lie. And these issues spoil any enjoyment that you can find in this candy-coated money sink production called \"Sword Art Online\". Even with only viewing the first 3 episodes, I have little hope for the future of this anime, as I can see little opportunity or skill that the writing staff could use to save this imminent train wreck.\\n\\n\r\nPlease don't take my review too harshly or critical (although it very well may be that!), keep in mind that I have only seen the first 3 episodes and am coming into this viewing with an open mind and neutral observations. I am not doing this to spite anyone, I just find it funny that people are so quick to praise this, and I would like to offer contradictory evidence.\\n\r\nThank you for your time.\\n",

            "content": "It's the prime example of a series that gets worse and worse with each episode and that's pretty much the worst thing that can happen in an anime. It's one thing if there's no real story or character development(Fairy Tail), but dragging down a interesting premise so far seems almost intentional.\r\nIt's easier to list the good aspects about SAO than the bad and pretty much the only thing that's legitimately good about it is it's premise and initially the setting. Which isn't an achievement because anyone with half a brain could've come up with these. But who could explain it better than the author himself?(everythingof the following is obvously fictional and contains spoilers, if you just want to see the ratings skip it):\\n\\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nHe probably thought:\\n\r\n\"Hey, i'm completely incapable of creating believable characters or a proper story, sticking to a theme and yeah, if i'm honest i also suck pretty much anything else, how can i still make a popular anime without having to work? Oh, i could target the 10-15 year old boys who don't care about all that. If i make an anime about MMO's they'll love it no matter what.\"\\n\\n\r\nSo he went to his producer who said:\"Yeah, great idea, catering to the lowest common dominator is and always will be the best way to make fast money. You'll get far, son!\"\\n\\n\r\nThen the author teamed up with some other people and they started fleshing out the story.\\n\\n\r\nSteve:\"I think we should focus on the emotions and struggles of the main characters in such a frightening world and the dark aspects of humanity when everything just comes down to surviving. An MMO setting also allows for ridicoulus character development and interesting enemies and fights like they've never done before.\"\\n\r\nAuthor:\"Shut up, Steve, you fucking dumbass. Our viewers don't care for that shit. We'll make the MC a weak kid who becomes overpowered as fuck in just two episodes. That's what i call character development, bitch. Kirito is just there for our viewers to insert themself into to fulfill their wishes of power. The female MC only exists to support him. I know our viewers have various fetishes- like the tsundere or the weak girl who needs to be protected- and she's there to fulfill them all. That's what i call a deep character.\"\\n\r\nSteve(crying, leaving the room):\"...\"\\n\\n\r\nAuthor:\"So, now that the loser is gone: Someone wants to go bowling?\"\\n\r\nGreg:\"Shouldn't we finish the anime first?\"\\n\r\nAuthor:\"Why are you always such a fun killer. Alright Mr. Tryhard, design some fillers, then i'll be back later to design the last episode of the first season where everything of the main story happens.\"\\n\\n\r\nOn the next day.\\n\r\nAuthor:\"Guys... i drank to much last night. I know we're only around the half of the anime, but let's just end it here, i need to go to sleep.\"\\n\r\nGreg:\"The motives of the villain are still missing.\"\\n\r\nAuthor:\"Let's just say he forgot all of his motives. It's because he was so absorbed from the world he created he doesn't care for things like \"motives\". That's some deep shit.\"\\n\r\nGreg:\"I just think you're a lazy fuck, i'm out.\"\\n\\n\r\nSo at the end of season one the author was alone because he fired all of the people who criticized him. But he met his only goal, he got tha $$$ from the kids. But now he's fucked, with absolutely no ideas how to fill the other half of the series.\\n\\n\r\n\"Hmm i could do just the same thing again. But now the protagonists have long ears, that should be enough of a difference. There's also a nice underused trope i've heared of called \"damsel in distress\". That should be enough of a story. I hate the people who criticized me. How can i annoy them even more, how can i strap my series of the last good thing it has going for it? Oh, the fear of dying. Now it's just a normal game.\"\\n\\n\\n\r\nI could go further because i haven't even called out the worst what's going to happen but i have to stop here. The second season is just a train-wreck and pushes the weaknesses of the first half to the limit. \\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nI know all this sounded sarcastic, bitter and mean. But i think if you can count yourself to the target audience(10-15 year old boys), you can have a lot of fun with the first season, but you should stop there. Note that compared to other people who's rating system is: 10- great/9-many flaws/ 8-average/7-shit/6-0 - doesn't exist, 5 really means average for me. \\n\\n\r\nStory: \\n\r\nAlready explained, interesting premise ruined as much as possible. 14 episodes were already too little for a proper story in this setting and more than half of them are fillers. Until episode 14 i would've given it a 6 or 7/10. Slightly above average and enjoyable. But in episode 14 we see that the author put absolutely no thought into the story. 3/10 for the first season. 1/10 for the second.\\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\r\nhigh production value but that's it, there's nothing more to it, it just looks pretty. If shows like Monogatari or Mononoke are 9 or 10/10. There's no way this is more than 6/10, probably 7/10 if i'm fair.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10, but to be fair i can't think of an anime with a high production value that has bad music. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2/10 \\n\r\nbecause some minor characters are interesting. But you can't rate the mc's higher than 1. I don't think overpowered characters are bad in general, but i don't know what the author was thinking to put an extremely overpowered main character in a setting that is all about surviving. That's like putting Alucard in Pokemon to become Ash's new companion.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: \\n\r\n4/10. I would lie if i said i had no fun watching this. If you can see past the flaws, turn your brain of and watching it with the mind of a young teenager, the first season is mostly 8/10 until episode 14(which is 1/10). Second season probably 2/10 because i had absolutely no expectations anymore and sometimes got surprised by the smallest good things. if you combine the two seasons i think 4/10 is fair.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\r\nIt's unfair to criticize shonen because they don't touch adult themes, don't have deep, meaningful conversations or are loaded with symbolism. However the premise of this show is clearly very seinen. And it's completely fair to criticize shonen for their terrible storylines and characters, some of the best stories like TTGL or FMA:B are shonen.\\n\r\nObjectively it's a train wreck that even fails at it strengths. Who needs the million possible ways of power a character is able to have in an MMO, dual-wielding is the best and most unique ability! /s\\n\r\nIf you want an action packed shonen anime, i would recommend anything over SAO, even Fairy Tail or Naruto, because at least they stick to their themes and hilariously enough their characters seem deeper than the Mariana Trench compared to SAO.\\n\r\nIf you ever wanted to live in an MMO(which most people who played them thought about), it might be worth a watch. Mainly because there's currently no competition for this kind of anime and the author banked on that, sadly with success. It's unbelievable that this series has an average score of 8.3. People who liked it only liked it because of the setting and didn't care for anything else. I can get it if people give it a high \"enjoyment\" rating, but if you are rating the characters and the story with more than 3/10 you seriously need to watch other shows.\\n\\n\r\nSo, if you are a 10-15 year old boy with no girlfriend who dreams of living in an MMO, you've found a 10/10 anime for you(and i really don't mean this insulting, i wish i could've watched this anime 10 years ago). For anyone else- don't watch it. I'm giving it a 3/10 because i'm a huge fan of mmo's, action and nice graphics. If you don't value these three very high, it's nothing but an 1/10, maybe 2/10 for the looks.",

            "content": "Disclaimer: This is my first review, so I'm not entirely sure how to do it, and although I'll try to avoid it in the future,  I feel the need to talk about spoiler material in this one, so be warned. Also, there will be a TL;DR if you want to skip.\r\nFirst of all, the biggest problem with SAO is all the potential it wasted, it had good concepts, art and acting, but the story itself was a bad application of the good ideas, while the protagonist and his love interest were annoying and forgettable respectively and all the other characters that could have beeninteresting pass by without development or even much screen time, instead feeling as tools to advance the plot (technically every character and event in a fiction is this, but they shouldn't feel like they are just this, that's my point)\\n\\n\r\nI'll explain it in more detail later on, but for now I'll talk about the small details, from this point on there will be spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nMy first problem with the show started right on the first episode, I'll try to be brief on this one. The microwave explanation for the nerve gear made no sense, and why would people be so willing to put a death machine in their heads? Then there's the actual game, a game with no mages or ranged classes would not be that popular (I admit, this one is a total nitpick, but it still annoys me), then there's \"resources in an MMO are limited that's why I'll use my beta tester knowledge to go to good places to level up\" talk, it was bad both because it made no sense and because the protagonist I should side with already started like an unlikable jerk.\\n\\n\r\nAfter that it was pretty much a bunch of forgettable episodes that didn't really advance the plot and were just trying to give the protagonist some pseudo-character development, but it's not character development if the events don't add to your character, he kept shifting between attitudes all the time with no real solid character traits.\\n\\n\r\nThe aspects of this taking place inside a game were also really thrown at you with no care about the presentation, with inconsistencies like sometimes they feel pain and sometimes they don't, or how in the first episode and a lot of times they activated the skills by will but for some occasions they had to access the menu to use some and so goes, it felt like this anime was just thinking any reference is good because people will automatically relate to it.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the supporting cast, they were all there to highlight how awesome the \"hero\" supposedly was, that's really just it, even the love interest was forgettable. The first villain's actions were also questionable, saying he wanted his own world to watch, but trapping himself as a player too with the death rule applying to himself, or even the need to kill people if he could just trap them there, especially when later he wasn't portrayed as a really evil guy, just one crazy idiot.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the second part of the series, the second villain made much more sense, but was too forgettable, just your typical power-hungry lunatic. The plot started making even less sense from this point on, there had just been a huge tragedy about a virtual reality game and then people immediately go play another one, including the main character's sister, he almost died there and spent years trapped, what is the logical course of action for his sister? PLAY THE SAME TYPE OF GAME FOR NO REASON WHEN FLASHBACKS SHOWED SHE WASN'T EVEN REALLY INTO GAMES TO BEGIN WITH, she was there just for the sake of being a plot device.\\n\\n\r\nThe side-characters and \"people\" of this world are simply retarded, just think about it, would you act like they did if you were trapped in a virtual reality that could kill you? Would you simply go and play a new one after such an event had just ended? You wouldn't.\\n\\n\r\nThere is much more to criticize about this one, but I'll leave it as is because this is already too long.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: The protagonist is an idiot with no real character traits to him, but treated as awesome, all the side characters are merely tools for the plot and highlighting the hero, everyone in this world acts like a moron, the plot was an awful application of good concepts and the show is full of small details inconsistencies to big-time errors that completely ruin immersion.\\n\r\nThe animation is good and so is the acting, but that is not nearly good enough to save this show.",

            "content": "Final Verdict:(11/8/2012)\r\nI tried, I really tried. Unfortunately, the characters again took a downswing and stayed on that downhill path. The animation took a small hit because of the lack of focus on the battle scenes (hello, an action anime should have lengthy, quality fighting scenes), and the story failed to break past the \"fair\" barrier. \r\nMy patience was truly tested with this show. With a cop-out ending to the first season and an even more terrible start to the second, I cannot find myself continuing this series. There are far better shows currently airing, and unfortunately, SAO fails to make a cut. \r\nDropped Policy score:5/10. \\n\\n\\n\r\nI've been reading the myriad of reviews popping up about this anime, and I have been watching each new episode as it comes out to see how it goes. I've noticed this show has either received extraordinarily positive reception or has been deemed expendable. I am going to try to find the mid-ground in this premature review. (btw i'm going to use the character's in-game name instead of their full real names)\\n\\n\r\nIMPORTANT NOTE: I will repeat this again at the end, but keep in mind, I am reviewing the anime adaptation of Sword Art Online, not the original light novel. I am sure that many who have read the light novel with disagree about my premature opinions, but I am reviewing my thoughts on how the anime adaptation is portraying everything to me.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\n Kirito is assumed as an introvert in real life as the story briefly shows him as a shut-in who probably plays video games too much, but the director and others in charge of designing him probably made sure to differentiate him from your average creeper that stays at home all day in his room. The year is 2022, and a new video game has been launched called sword art online. As a highly touted commodity, it is fitting that only 10000 copies were released to the masses. The game requires the Nerve Gear, a futuristic type of gaming \"console\" in the form of a helmet that you wear.  \\n\\n\r\n(This is where it gets spoiler-ish if you don't want to know anything at all before watching it, but it's also the de-facto characteristic that makes the story great)\\n\\n\r\nAs he passes a day in this new virtual world, he and his new acquaintance, Klein, figure out that they cannot logout. Controlled chaos ensues as the entire community is amassed into a Colosseum and the creator of the game, Akihiko Kayaba, makes an astonishing announcement. You cannot log out of sword art online. There is but two ways to do so: either beat the game by completing all 100 floors or \"die\" in the game, which will essentially trigger the Nerve Gear (also designed by Kayaba) to fry your brain and actually kill you. The twist to this sadistic MMORPG is what essentially makes the story interesting and worth watching more. Few shows I know of utilize such a twist, and if you were to just take the story itself at face value, it is still an interesting premise that has potential. (albeit it seems to feel rushed more recently) One gripe I do have about the story is that generally, there isn't a sense of urgency that usually accommodates a life or death story. Although you usually feel that when watching the battle scenes, everyday town life seems way too carefree.\\n\\n\r\nUpdate 9/9:\\n\r\nAgain, there's no complaining the concept of the story is unique. Some little RPG-esque nuances are subtly fitted in to increase the enjoyment of the series; however, this story has a huge achilles heel that it rapidly dragging it down: the pacing. I am fully aware that the light novel is ridiculously long and they only have 25 or so episodes to complete the story, but this is still not a valid enough excuse to account for consistent gaffes in the pace of the story. Although everything might feel smooth for a watcher who has read the light novel (or at least has a good amount of background), as a viewer who watches this show with absolutely no background, I am at a complete loss frequently. Still, great concept, enticing story, but blatantly poor execution.\\n\r\n(6/10)-Oh boy has this taken a downswing.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nA-1 pictures has again provided a good consistent quality to its art. The character designs are fitting, and I found it quite comical when (spoiler alert I guess)...they used the mirror and suddenly like 90% of the girl avatars turned into guys (because it revealed their facial identity since the Nerve Gear knows what your face looks like). Although the series is not quite eye candy, some of the settings are beautiful and the animation of the fighting scenes are done relatively well. Although, like most anime, there are some blemishes here or there. For instance, several important animation points are undermined as fluid battles are replaced with shiny lights moving rapidly around still frames to make it appear as if you are watching a high quality piece of work. The character designs are decent too. \\n\\n\r\n(8/10)-Great quality, sometimes inconsistent\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nAgain, like the art, the sound is nothing that would amaze the average viewer. (though i don't have much to back this claim up at this point) The high point of the sound is definitely the opening, crossing field, by LiSA. You can't go wrong by having her do any type of song. The ending, Yume Sekai, by Tomatsu Haruka oddly doesn't fit very well with the whole feel of the series. A relatively calming song, it just doesn't work with the supposed chaotic, fast-paced feel that a life and death type of story should have. \\n\r\nFinal update: There is no doubt the OST is the ray of hope in the package that is sword art online. Composed by Kajiura Yuki, the music, frankly, is on another level compared to the series itself. It's a shame how such good music is often squandered on relatively subpar series. \\n\r\n(8/10)-Great \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nUnfortunately, nobody can make a good story work out without good characters. Many shows I have watched before (ie: guilty crown) have had its essence nearly torn apart by less than exemplary characters. Although a character like Asuna (main female protagonist) as well as other supporting characters maintain a sound set of characteristics to follow by, the plague of the series is unfortunately, the most important character, Kirito. (Little tidbit of knowledge: Kirito is also one of 1000 beta testers of this game too, so that explains why he's so good at the game)\\n\r\nKirito is more than just a mystery. Personally, I call him Shu 2.0(guilty crown watchers know what I mean). I really do not care what other people try to say about Kirito that is positive because I simply dismiss it as hogwash up to this point of the series. Some might say he's a complete bada** while others label him a beta male. I would be completely fine if he was one or the other, but the unfortunate news is that he's BOTH...in the SAME episode...TWICE. I apologize if it sounds like i am simply hating on his personality, but he is no different than the infamous Shu. The difference between him as Shu is that Shu can at least portray himself as either the alpha or beta male for a good chunk of time. Unfortunately, in the 3 episodes shown so far, 2 of them show his complete roller coaster of emotions on display. \\n\r\n(spoiler alert)\\n\r\nIn the 2nd episode, he goes from loner, to nice guy, to a sort of dark-misunderstood villain. In the 3rd episode, he suddenly finds friends and gets to know a group really well and opens up(probably the MOST awkward transition i have ever seen. I was questioning whether I skipped an episode, or 5), but then due to unfortunate circumstances, he turns into an angsty crybaby again (while relatively justified). If Kirito wants to win over credibility again, he must choose both his physical and emotional role. He cannot continue this nearly shameful display. However, the positive side of Kirito's character is that when he acts like a bada**, he is a pretty good one. \\n\\n\r\nFinal update: The characters probably couldn't have gotten anymore worse. Asuna's character has been dehumanized to that of a prize rather than the strong independent woman that she was portrayed as in the first 2 episodes. Kirito's \"I can do anything because I'm the best\" character is devoid of any noticeable development. And finally, all of the other characters aren't even noticeable. \\n\r\nCharacters: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nTo be painstakingly honest, I enjoy this series when I am not trying to ponder the mystery that is Kirito. Since I love the concept of the story and the whole get to the 100th floor and beat the final boss thing, I am able to get a good amount of enjoyment. There are some lighthearted, comical scenes to break a tense mood sometimes, and the progression of this whole ride, although rushed, is enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nFinal update:\\n\r\nSeeing how I can't even get myself to catch up (and dropped it in the end), enjoyment takes a slight hit. The premise was interesting to keep me attached for a while, but I just got bored (yes, even with the mach 5 pacing)\\n\r\n(6/10)-\\n\\n\r\nOverall: (11/8/2012)\\n\r\nThe show had all the potential in the world. It started off relatively strong, boasting a great concept; however, it just couldn't hold on to what it promised, and to rub some more salt on the would, the terrible characters didn't help at all either. In the end, as stated above at the top, the show gets my dropped show rating, a 5/10.",

            "content": "SAO is one of the most talked about animes this year. It gets hype, it gets love, it gets hate. It has its upsides, but it has its downsides too. Don't come to Sword Art Online expecting deep meanings and though provoking arcs, its an anime that you can very easily watch with your brain turned off. And there is nothing wrong with that if you come to the table expecting as such. Not every anime has to be some deep, philosophical master piece. \r\nStory(5): Again, the story doesn't provoke much thought. It opens quite well, and the time skips were rather well played inmy opinion. While Kirito was alone, all he did was focus on getting stronger. You don't need a weekly update on his progress with that. The side stories were a bit rushed, and seemed completely irrelevant. After helping these women (who's names I can no longer remember), he simply went on and never talked to them again. From what I can pick up, Kirito doesn't interact with a whole lot of people on a personal scale. It surprises me that he never got mail from them or things of that nature. The story really only makes any sense halfway through the Aincrad arc.\\n\\n\r\nArt(9): Being set in a video game wonderland, the artists were set free to draw big, flowery landscapes and ye olde towns under a big blue sky. Being able to ignore the laws of physics also made for a few well drawn backgrounds, such as numerous floating islands. It's an artists wet dream.\\n\\n\r\nSound(8): Personally, I never picked up on any repetition or stale music. It was either so underwhelming, or the tracks they used match the situations almost perfectly. (I'm siding with the latter of the two.) The detail of the sound work, from the player's menus to sword clanging to the rumble of bosses was great in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(6): I can't lie, my tsundere sense was tingling about 6 or so episodes in. The reason my character score isn't lower is that I'm a sucker for character development, no matter how stereotypical or expected. You have the quiet, confident guy and the harsh, tooseriousforyou girl, do the math.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(9): Simply watching the anime the first time through, I was watching my clock every week for the next release. I couldn't wait. Regardless of how lackluster or ill thought out things may have been, I enjoyed the anime, and in the end that's all that matters. Reading other reviews I do see some flaws, but they don't affect how much I liked SAO. If you enjoy video games, and you enjoy anime, you WILL enjoy SAO, it's almost guaranteed. But just to reiterate, don't expect a masterpiece of plot and story. You kinda need to just blindly enjoy it for what you see.\\n\\n\r\nOverall(8): It isn't the best anime ever, but it is by no means the worst. The action scenes were well played out, the art was amazing, the sound matched perfectly. The story and characters are a little bland, but that is the case for many animes. My overall score is 8 because my enjoyment score was 9. Regardless of any flaws anything has, and this goes for the entirety of life, if you enjoyed it, it was worth it. And being an avid video game player and anime watcher, this seemed like a great anime for me, and it was.",

            "content": "I think most people that began watching Sword Art Online, did it because of the MMORPG factor. Needless to say I was very disappointed when SAO became nothing more than a love history.\r\nThe last couple of episodes have pretty much killed my interest in the series. When most anime tackle themes of love it typically ends up being pretty bad and sappy, but this one.. it was just awful.\r\nThe world isn't well thought out at all, the writer didn't bother to lay down the rules of this MMO world, the pacing is INCREDIBLY off, they missed a LOT of opportunities to make fun in-jokes aboutonline gaming, and it's a pseudo-harem. The harem element in it sucks. Not to mention they force down your throat \"OH LOL IT'S NOT ACTUALLY HIS SISTER IT'S HIS COUSIN\" because HEAVEN FORBID a single female character under the age of 20 in this show NOT fall in love with the main character- Just because you need to know how awesome he is.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a poorly written, super contrived self-insert fanboy story. One reviewer described it as \"Twilight Saga for teenage boys\", and I agree whole-heartedly. \\n\\n\r\nThere is NOTHING psychological about SAO-- There could have been, but they just didn't bother. It honestly feels like it was written by a 15 year old, and from what I've heard he DID write it when he was 15 and it very much shows.\\n\\n\r\n I haven't heard anything of substance other than \"WELL IT'S REALLY COOL AND STUFF\". And for the record, I have watched 15 episodes. So it's an overrated show.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem with the harem element in SAO is that it doesn't add anything at all to the story. It didn't need to be there. The very first girl didn't bother me because they kept going back to his guilt with her, so that was fine. Asuna was obviously fine because she's the main interest. But the beast tamer and Asuna's best friend AND HIS FRIGGIN LITTLE SISTER were all INCREDIBLY unnecessary and didn't add ANYTHING. Their only purpose is to make Kirito look better. Any of those characters could be replaced by male friends as opposed to female potential love interests.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, as mentioned before, are bland.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the mainstream shows, they get plenty of hate and quite frankly they are all FAR better shows than SAO. I mean that in all seriousness. Every one of those has a lot of complexity to the show, fun characters, good story, some amount of thought required, and has a large helping of entertainment.\\n\\n\r\nI may not like some of them but I can admit that at their core they are decent shows and I can see why people like them. There IS something to them, some kind of substance. Are they overrated? Sure, but they still get a TON of flack.\\n\\n\r\nThe writers for each of those shows put a LOT into them. Those shows stand out and have personality. There is no soul or personality to SAO. None. This There is no character development in SAO. NONE.\\n\\n\r\nThe end of the MMORPG arc was just about getting married in a computer game and random people complimenting them on how they were so happy.\\n\\n\r\nWhat happened to the \"Lets-get-out-of-this-place-no-matter-what\"?\\n\\n\r\nThe plot became nothing more than You are 12 and I am 12. We should get married and have an 11 year old daughter. har har.",

It\u2019s not so bad~ SAO\r\n We all like to play games: fighting, racing, action games, etc. But the anime I'm going to review today is SAO(virtual reality game, MMORPG). This anime takes place in the year 2024 where technology has influenced a lot. This is the story of people who started playing SAO, when suddenly they get trapped inside the game. if a person's HP falls to 0, he/she dies in the game as well as in the real world. The people won't get out of the game until they have completed all the 100 floors, defeating all the boss levels.Somewhere between the episodes 19-23 the story is exaggerated where the time is wasted.\\n\r\n     Otherwise, this anime has a good story, so i'll mark it as: (6/10)\\n\r\n                                              ____________\\n\r\n    ART: (9/10)\\n\r\n  WHAT I LIKE IN SAO? Maybe, when ever playing a game I look at the sceneries,graphics(art). The art of SAO is simply attractive, beautiful and gorgeous...They have focused on the most delicate thing like making the grass of natural color, the butterflies, insects and other beats and animals. SAO takes high points in art.\\n\r\n                                               ___________\\n\\n\r\n   SOUND: (9/10)\\n\r\n  In every anime what i like are the opening and ending songs. In SAO, both opening songs have extremely good music as well as lyrics and unlike opening songs, ending songs are slow but they are also good. Whenever starting a new episode the opening song made me excited.\\n\r\nSAO also took high points in sound/music.\\n\r\n                                               __________\\n\r\n   CHARACTER:(5/10)\\n\r\n The viewer in anime watches the characters and how are they made. In my opinion, the characters were made good. when Kirigaya(Kirito) fought to someone, his expressions showed and told that what was he feeling, the pain he was feeling at that time. Kirigaya attracted girls. He was a die hard fighter. In the beginning Asuna was shown as a leader of the guild but later she depended on Kirigaya. this is the reason why i gave low points in the character. Whereas Sugu being Krito's sister fell in love with him in ALFheim online not knowing that kirito was his brother(Kirigaya). This was rather entertaining.\\n\r\n                                          ____________\\n\r\n Enjoyment: (5/10)\\n\r\n  I enjoyed the first half of SAO and the last two episodes ..The between episodes were time wasting. well, there are some scenes viewer enjoys the anime , like when fightinng the boss or a great monster, that felt really great.\\n\r\n                                      ________________\\n\r\n            OVERALL: (6/10) \\n\r\n    Although , it is not worth watching again, but i would recommend myself to watch it again as it has a good story and great sound art.\\n\\n\r\nWILL BE WAITING FOR YOUR FEEDBACK.",

            "content": "When I first read the synopsis for Sword Art Online I was enthralled to see that there was going to be a show that featured video games as a major theme and actually looked promising. Once I began watching this, my excitement quickly turned to disappointment. The general premise of this series was great but as that being its only strength it would not standout among the more matured anime viewers. I believe the targeted audience for this anime was teenage gamers, boys to be more specific. The male protagonist is someone that all teenage boys yearn to be; invincible, charismatic, the center of allattention and the prowess to get the girl. I'd say that the writer used this to his advantage to attract a large audience, who doesn't love a hero with the ability to stop anything in his path, right?\\n\\n\r\nThe general story-line of Sword Art Online isn't bad, it's just how it was delivered. Locked in a prison of virtual reality where as the only escape is to beat the game without dying or pay the cost of losing your actual life in the process. After the first story arc ended the series took a major turn for the worse. Plot holes became more severe than the regular. A good example of one would be that on several occasions characters would die without actually dying in person. Just the point being of how events would happen without getting an explanation when they were needed was a general theme to SAO.\\n\\n\r\nMy favorite part of the series by far was the art and the animation. In the world of Sword Art Online every level of a dungeon had a different theme, ranging from endless fields to frozen waste lands. Just the detail that would be put into these locations would leave you struck in awe. The animation has been some of the best I have seen as well, with fluent motions from the characters I would enjoy the fight scenes with great attention. As for the sound and ambiance of it, I thought that it was well done. Monsters would make sounds that you'd think they'd make and the sound of clashing swords was as realistic as it could be.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the character development in this show there was evidently none if barely some at all. The male protagonist stays the same throughout. As for the female protagonist she makes one major change then stays sticks with it for the rest of the series. The villains never seemed to really pose a serious threat to the main character and in that being so I couldn't develop a hate for them, no matter how dastardly they may have been. I noticed on several occasions during the show that there were some really heart wrenching moments but I just couldn't get into them because of the fact that I had no emotional attachment to any of the characters in the scene. I believe if they would have took the time and had an episode or two dedicated to letting the viewer get to know the main characters a little more then perhaps I would have shed a tear or two.\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment for the series came to its peak during the fight scenes, just that feeling of excitement during a fast paced battle really kept me at the edge of my toes during the whole show. My least favorite part would had to have been when there was an emotional scene solely because I could get into it. I was thrown for a loop on some of the twists and that made me happy but that only happened a few times, besides that, the show was quite predictable and would make an episode boring to watch if I already anticipated what the coming events were to be.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Sword Art Online is not necessarily a bad show, the reason being that this is such a controversial issue is that the series was over hyped leaving incorrigible fans pitted against people that had their hearts set on letting the world know that it isn't as great as people think it is. With that in mind, remember that we watch anime to be entertained, not to fight about which is better or worse. In conclusion I would like to state what I believe to be the worst and best points of the SAO in my opinion; I would consider the story arcs and ending to be one of the more cliche alternatives I have seen in a while but the atmosphere during the scenes made up for it a bit. The main character was too well liked. Plain and simple. If he were to have had a rival or someone to push him around some then he probably would have developed more as a good character. The best part by far was the art, looking at the landscapes really made this show more enjoyable for me and hopefully for others as well. Lastly I would recommend this to those that have just started watching anime, after watching so much people start to get picky and notice little things more and more so you should enjoy this while you still can.",

            "content": "Whenever I state my opinion about a show that is immensely popular, I often don\u2019t use the term \u201coverrated\u201d. The reason for this is because when people use the word, they often mean \u201cyou like a show I hate\u201d. The times when I use that term, I try to make sure that it\u2019s understood as \u201cthe show is getting more credit than it deserves\u201d. Not only when it comes to bad shows, but also those that are good and worth your time. If anything is treated as a masterpiece when it\u2019s not close to it, overrated is the word of the day. \r\nIn my reviewof the most talked and viewed anime of 2012, that word is the short version of my feelings for this show.    \\n\\n\r\nSword Art Online (a.k.a SAO) is an anime adaptation of a Light Novel with the same name that was released in 2009. The author of the novel is Kawahara Reki, who is also known for writing Accel World, another popular novel that received an anime adaptation earlier than SAO. Judging from works, Kawahara always use games as the center subject of his stories.  \\n\\n\r\nThe anime itself is directed by Itou Tomohiko and the studio behind the show is A-1 Pictures, known for other well-known adaptations such as Kuroshitsuji, Fairy Tail and Ao no Exorcist. While I\u2019m not familiar with most of their works, it quite safe to assume the show is in decent hands. \\n\\n\r\nLet me get one thing straight. I\u2019ve played a few MMO\u2019s in my younger days and currently play sometimes when I\u2019m bored (And the last MMO I played was in 2011). In all of them, I was like Kirito, a Solo Player. I rarely teamed up with a guild, joined a party or talked to anyone (Mostly because players prefer the internet language, which I don\u2019t understand very well). The only difference between me and him is that I was never among the best. The highest level I achieved in an MMO is level 40, while Kirito have top marks like it\u2019s genetic. MMO games are a lackluster to me now due to the amount of hours spent on just leveling up and boring questing. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, I was drawn back to that world when I watched my first episode in a small anime convention that showed the first four episodes. I was enjoying it and it was something I\u2019ve never experienced (I have not seen .hack). I decided to take a dive into this new world and returned to the surface with something to share the world with.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nPLOT:\\n\\n\r\nMy reason for watching it in the first place was because of the concept. When I found out that the story was \u201cA virtual reality game turned into a real life death game\u201d, it caught my interest. Not only that, but the world was solely created to satisfy a sadistic scientist who wanted to play god for real (That was my impression of the introduction). The first episode game me a good impression and a determination to see more of the show. From that point forward, I was really enjoying myself.\\n\\n\r\nBut that did not last. It has been discussed by hardcore and casual fans alike where the story started to fall. The most common one is episode 3 to episode 7, because those stories were side stories in the original light novel series. If it\u2019s true or not matters little, since the main storyline isn\u2019t any better. If the side stories were hated for being about random sh*t, then the main one does not deserve more praise. To me, both the filler and the main story are equally as bad that I almost thought they were the same thing. And when things get a bit more exciting after a mini story with little purpose was done, the story decided to end there. How things turned out was a bit unexpected, but it felt forced at the same time. It was like the writer was in a hurry. If the original story was longer, I might\u2019ve not criticize it as much as I did now. \\n\\n\r\nWhat made it somewhat worse was that the second half of the story focuses on an entirely different plot and concept. The appeal of the original concept was lost when the story decided to be about something else and forget why many viewers started watching it in the first place. This would\u2019ve worked better if it was a sequel to the story (like a second season) instead of being a part of the same season. That\u2019s the ALO arc for you.  \\n\\n\r\nBut the reason why the story fails to become what many wanted to see was because of how messy and poor the execution is. The amount of time skips, side stories and how short the main story was proved that the writing of the story is in fact quite bad. I learned from classes about movies that a story has a specific structure to work. While I will not go into detail due to the fact it takes forever, I\u2019ll just say that SAO follows that structure poorly. It\u2019s like it\u2019s missing a pillar somewhere around the end. \\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I loathed the cheap drama and the Deus ex Machina. The drama was so laughably predictable in a narrative sense I felt unmoved, even when the story gave me its saddest scene. The Deus ex Machina was used so often that it made me think that the creator ran on limited imagination when this was made.\\n\\n\r\nAnd of course, my number one question was unanswered through the entire series. I assume you all know, but if you don\u2019t, I\u2019ll just say \u201cf*cking Kayaba\u201d.          \\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\\n\r\nBelieve it or not, the true reason why Sword Art Online falls flat for me is the characters we have followed through the whole story. Within the community, there are a fair amount of love and hate for them. Or to be correct, there are a fair amount of love and hate for Kirito or Asuna, because nobody cares about the rest. What there is to know is that SAO have quite a share amount of characters, and since the game is focused on an MMO game and not an RPG, it\u2019s only natural that there are so many people to know about. Sadly, this anime does not succeed to get a high score in the character section.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s start with our lead characters:\\n\\n\r\nKirito (a.k.a Kirigaya Kazuto), the main protagonist is described as an average kid with socialization problems, except that is not true. While it is shown, it\u2019s only portrayed when secondary character Klein is shown. To everyone else, he has no problem at all. That is beside the point, however. In the anime community, he is either a lovable badass or a hated Gary Stu. But what\u2019s problematic about him is not only because he\u2019s a perfect hero, but his character in general. Besides the fact he is designed like every other generic harem male lead, Kirito\u2019s reason for hitting the trash can is because he has no true identity. \\n\\n\r\nHis entire personality is based depending on what scene is being played. If the scene requires him to be stupid, he is stupid. If it requires him to be smart, he is smart. If he needs to be a badass, he is badass. The idea is that there is nothing about Kirito that identifies him, at least not as an individual. This could also be because of how he is portrayed as some boys want to be and becomes a wish-fulfillment type of character. All the character traits that are given to him are what defies a guy as perfect and at the same time, deny him any other traits. This doesn\u2019t give him a strong character identity, but it rather makes him a prime example of a Gary Stu character. In other words, his character is so scattered and unbalanced that I can\u2019t even call him a character of a story, but rather a visual novel protagonist with a voice and eyes.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nAsuna, the main heroine shares the same problem, but on a different scale. While Kirito has little character to speak of, Asuna has too much of it to have an identity. When we first saw her, she was a quiet and mysterious person in the corner who rarely speaks till her face was shown. Next time she appeared, she was a tough leader with a cold personality. Next time, she became a Tsundere. After that, she was a scary lady. And after the event that\u2026 screw it, you know what I\u2019m talking about. The distinctiveness of Asuna does not exist.\\n\\n\r\nEvery personality she uses is just different fetishes for the general otaku community to obsess over. And it works, because there are a f***ton of fans that adore her. Because of her multiple of personalities, I don\u2019t even know what part of her makes her so appealing to others. Not only in the real world, but in-universe, everyone seems to be after her butt. In SAO, she is more of a prize than an ally to her guild, and Kirito fights them to claim said price. Her character becomes less chaotic later in the series, but then she is just and only the main love interest that relies on Kirito all the time and it pisses me off.   \\n\\n\r\nNow, if the fans of her comes to my door and points out that she can kick ass, I simply reply \u201cBullsh*t\u201d. While she can pack quite a punch and is one of the most powerful players in the game, she never had a moment to shine. When an important fight is on screen, she is either a decoy, a distraction, a helpless damsel or a meat shield. Not only that, but Kirito takes all the credit in every fight, making her more of a motivation pet rather than a fellow comrade in arms. It\u2019s quite clear she is only a fighter because it attracts more attention and making her more appealing to female viewers (which doesn\u2019t always work). The fact that a female character can fight doesn\u2019t automatically make her a good character.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nOh, I hear \u201cwhat about Suguha?\u201d in the background, but I\u2019ll keep it short. I\u2019ll be honest and say I was interested in her when she appeared. I did not expect a good character since the ones before didn\u2019t do their job, but her relationship with Kirito in the real world made me hope for something I\u2019ve not seen in anime for so long: a brother and sister relationship with no incest. But of course, I got slapped in the face by the show and it laughed it\u2019s a** off when my hopes were broken. It was nice to focus on someone else than just the \u201cTwilight v2\u201d couple, but she didn\u2019t create a strong impression and felt like just another collection of Kirito\u2019s harem. The only point I give her is that she tried to stay away from him because they were siblings, but adding incest at all still did not change my everlasting hate for its enormous presence in modern anime. Yes, I know they are in reality cousins, but we all know it\u2019s just an excuse to get away with it.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nBut aren\u2019t there more characters? There are, but they are so irrelevant to the story that might as well be replaced by rocks and it wouldn\u2019t make much difference. The Sword Art Online icon that is used on this site would give you the idea that the story focused around these people, but the truth is that only Kirito and Asuna matter at all. Every other character appears briefly and sometimes only show up in one episode before disappearing. Next time they appear, a minute cameo is all they can achieve. There are also those whose only purpose is to die, and it becomes so obvious in time that it\u2019s not even funny. It\u2019s a shame, because I wanted to see more of the side characters and learn a bit more of them. However, it felt like the series resented me for it and told me to focus only on the main characters (which I genuinely disliked). It was very frustrating, since I\u2019ve always have hated that type of character treatment.\\n\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION:\\n\\n\r\nUnlike how I criticized the two catagories above, I can honestly say that the animation is quite good. While not so amazing that you get eyegasm by just looking at it, it\u2019s above average and can be called stunning, if you willing to give it that much credit. When action is used, the movement is quite fluid and action packed, making these moments never boring and suspenseful. The usage of CGI is also quite well done and is used in a way that it blends in with the environment. This is mostly helped because the setting is a game, but it feels like a part of the game when it\u2019s used. Even CGI haters can\u2019t really criticize its existence. The background and setting material aren\u2019t as impressive, however, but it\u2019s quite safe to say it\u2019s good enough. While it cannot hope to be compared with Ufotable quality, it at least above something completely unimpressive like Naruto. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing that the animation can be criticized for is its habit of using shots that has no movement. It\u2019s mostly used during large crowd sequences, which is somewhat understandable. It\u2019s not the first anime to use them and it\u2019s not a prime example of an anime that uses it all the time, but it\u2019s something to think about.\\n\\n\r\nOh wait. There is also a bit a fanservice as well, and anybody that knows me knows that I loathe anime that takes that route. However, it does not appear so much or get in the way when something serious is happening, unlike something that uses it so much that it\u2019s annoying like High School of the f*cking Dead.                   \\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUNDTRACK:\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I cannot badmouth about is the music of the show. In the anime community, just knowing that Kajiura Yuki is doing the music automatically means win. I can\u2019t blame them, because her work in one of my favorite shows of all time still impresses me to this day. Unfortunately, even she can't save the show. While the soundtrack was very good, it was not her best work. Many are forgotten and I only remember a few, and it\u2019s mostly because they were repetitive. Still, the songs did fit the scenes when it was used and were quite pleasant to listen to. This is not Kara no Kyoukai or Fate/Zero material, but it\u2019s good enough to stand on its own.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and endings did not however do as great. All four were quite generic and obvious for a title like Sword Art Online, but they aren\u2019t obnoxious in any way. They in fact are quite fine. Personally, I found Opening 1: Crossing fields quite catchy, despite how average it is. So I can\u2019t say anything really negative about the songs that were picked for this anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFINAL VERDICT: \\n\\n\r\nThe only way I can describe SAO in no more than five words is that it\u2019s bad, but looks pretty. Not all of it was dreadful and some episodes were quite good, but when looking at the larger picture, I can\u2019t accept its popularity or love that has been given to it. It might look good, but the things that keep a show together (Story and Characters) can only be described as awful.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5 \\n\r\nCharacters: 3 \\n\r\nAnimation: 7 \\n\r\nSoundtrack:  8\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\r\nOverall: 5  \\n\\n\r\nHowever, I will not discourage and tell you to not watch this anime, despite my low rating of it. It still quite possible to enjoy this series if are looking to watch something simple and average. Just don\u2019t expect the next big thing or anything amazing. This is not for those who want something thought provoking or something original. And if we are going to question its popularity, let\u2019s just say it was luckier than better titles of 2012.  \\n\\n\r\nNow that I think about it, Sword Art Online works perfectly as a visual novel. It already has a generic protagonist and a harem of all type of girls involved. In fact, I\u2019ve heard that the game \u201cSword Art Online: Infinity Moment\u201d is just a dating sim game with gameplay. Are you guys sure this story was meant for a Light Novel?    \\n",

            "content": "Sword Art Online, the hype surrounding SAO when it came out was through the roof. Is that completely fair for this show? Does it live up to all the hype? Well... kinda, but not in the areas that is should. Let's dive into this.\r\nSTORY: \r\nOur story begins with the release of the brand new VRMMORPG, Sword Art Online. Players are able to control their in game avatar with their bodies while wearing something called Nerve Gear. On its launch day everything seems to be running smoothly until the creator, Akihiko Kayaba, announces to everyone that they are trapped in SAO until someone clears all 100floors of it. Oh and if you die in the game, you die for real. PEOPLE DIE IF THEY ARE KILLED! So the story is setup like it will be an epic action adventure quest to survive, which is a really great idea for a story. Sadly the writers didn't focus very much on this at all, instead they focus on the romance between the two main characters, which I'll get to later. The problem I have with the story is it doesn't focus on the main issue enough, the issue of you know being trapped in a comma and forced to play a life-or-death survival game! The time skips that are in SAO doesn't help the story either, the writers condensed around two years of time into the first three or so episodes. I was left wonder, what happened in that amount of time? Why can't I see that? Many questions were left unanswered until the end (also I'll get to later) In short, the story was a mess, it was promising but it failed.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\r\nOur main protagonist is Kirito, a solo player that likes to play a Massively Multiplayer Game by himself... yea so he is the anti-social lone-wolf cardboard cutout. I didn't like him at the beginning of SAO. He just felt like another generic quietly overpowered character that we've seen about one billion times before; however, over the course of the series I grew to like him a little bit more. Mainly seeing the affects of being trapped in a video game for over two years. This little ounce of character development made him seem more real. Next we have Princess Peach, woops, I mean Asuna. She was introduced as a badass female lead who didn't take anything from anybody, but she turns into a generic tsundere, because OMG Kirito! The romance between Kirito and Asuna is so forced, and so generic I'm fairly sure that a five year old could write a better love story than this. Kirito and Asuna didn't get along all that well at the beginning, but all of a sudden they get \"married\" wut. The last character is Suguha who is introduced later on an gets plenty of development by which I mean she is a walking piece of fan service and is completely useless without Kirito. Every female character that Kirito runs into seems to become completely reliant on him for no good reason. The supporting cast is... kinda meh. Honestly the supporting characters didn't do a whole lot for me. \\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\nWOW, just WOW. The art and animation in Sword Art Online is something to behold. It is simply gorgeous. The world they are trapped in looks stunning and the action scenes are amazing to look at. The art and animation definitely shines its brightest when you see the epic boss battles. The character designs are also very good as well. If you the opportunity to watch this in High Definition, FREAKING DO IT! SAO looks amazing.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nAt this point I should just have to say Yuki Kajiura and that's all. The openings for SAO were great sounding and the OST was a great thing to listen too. She really is one of the best out there. The music always seemed to make everything better so thank you Yuki Kajiura for being awesome. The dub of SAO is also very well done. In the beginning I wish Todd Haberkorn was Kirito instead, but Bryce Papenbrook did a very nice job giving Kirito a shy and quiet personality, and he was also made the transition to very pissed off Kirito very smooth. I'm glad that Bryce got Kirito over Todd because well... Todd is in everything else anyway (included SAO) but also Bryce did a very good job with the screaming. Chermai Leigh did a good job as Asuna too, but there wasn't a whole lot she did that stood out as amazing. \\n\\n\r\nENDING: (No spoilers)\\n\r\nIf you've read any of my reviews you know my opinion about endings, THERE ARE PARAMOUNT! A good show can be ruined by a bad ending, and a mediocre show can be made great by a great ending. SAO sits around the middle in that regard. The ending is very much a Deus Ex style ending, it was similar I believe to that of .hack//Sign, but at least SAO offered closure. It wasn't a bad ending just a little bit fast. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nTo wrap it all up Sword Art Online is a great looking and great sounding show, but is let down by a messy story and characters that are hard to relate to. I do believe it gets better at the end, but I am still disappointed at the wasted potential that was left out of the story. I still recommend SAO to anyone, but don't listen to the hype about it being the best anime ever. It is an enjoyable watch.\\n",

Don't get me wrong, one of my guilty pleasures in anime is a main character being good at what they do as long as it's executed well and they worked their way to it. This had potential to be considered one of the greats but had a poor presentation overall and gets too much praise to its actual worth.\r\nMain protagonist and a whole lot of other people are playing  this game calledSword Art Online with a twist that if they die in the game, they die for real. The only way for everyone to leave SAO is beating the game.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory 6/10\\n\r\nThe concept has been done before and honestly people who have been rating this show a 10/10 with comments saying \"OMG BEST ANIME EVURR NOTHING LIKE IT!!!\" I have to say shame to you and to go watch more shows  before rating this story a 10/10. In fact the only reason why it probably gets such a high rating from other is because it's fairly new and that the art is nicely done. \\n\r\nOther than that, I wouldn't bother giving this a second thought. The characters were presented poorly and there wasn't much to look forward to since it follows the formula of protagonist has a problem, they try to solve problem, and then solves the problem. Nothing wrong with that of course but after the first couple times seeing it happen over and over with no real change it leaves a bad taste in my mouth.\\n\\n\r\nArt 6/10:\\n\r\nI would of liked more contrast on the character looks; most of the main/side characters seem to mesh together into one clump and not have real distinction from one another. In fact if it weren't for names I would probably just call them main character number one and main character number two or the chick with long orange hair. Still the colors and surroundings went well together and that should get some credit. \\n\\n\r\nSound 5/10:\\n\r\nThere wasn't any music that really got distinction to make it stand out that made me want to look it up and listen to. I could honestly watch the entire thing without having sound and still have the same feeling about it. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 1/10:\\n\r\nHaving watched halfway I already knew this guy was not going to have any character development whatsoever. He was great at everything he did the first time around and everyone either loved the guy or hated him. There wasn't much that made any character stand out or want me to root to win. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the things I hated about Kirito is that from start to finish on the show is that he hasn't made any real progress as a character. He stays about the same the whole way through, even with the losses he makes in game. Halfway through watching the show I found myself rooting that Kiritito lose a battle to just to watch him grovel and cry so at least I can watch his goody to shoes suffer a bit for being great at what he does.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10:\\n\r\nIt wasn't something I could really say \"Wow can't wait til the next episode comes out!\" but it was also one where I didn't  drop because it wasn't awful and was already halfway through it. I found myself doing things constantly while I was watching it such as pausing it halfway to watch a different show or leaving it playing while cooking/eating. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 4/10:\\n\r\nOverall, it was something that helped time passed by. It had a decent enough story/art to want to watch through all the way and have some enjoyment watching. Unfortunately it's also something I will never bother watching over again. There was nothing memorable about the anime at all and the character development occurred as often as Kirito loses a battle.",

            "content": "Let me start off by saying this review is based almost ENTIRELY on part 1 of this anime (which is the first 14 episodes). After reading all the reviews posted on here about SAO I felt that I needed to write one (and my first mind you) to clear the slate about what others have said. Could the anime have been better? Of course, but for what we got I think it was extremely enjoyable. \r\nStory: I give the story an 8/10 simply because this is the first anime of this kind that I've seen and LIKED. I think the thing I liked most aboutKirito in this is that he was a beta tester and a beater and to me that made him stand out above everyone else and really take the role of that hero and made the story revolving around him a lot easier to understand and enjoy. When I was watching this anime with my friend the way he described it was this anime is an anime of feels. Heavenly feels one second then sad hellish feels. Which for the most part is true. The anime story keeps you guessing as to what is going to happen next, what boss is going to be found next, and what rare item somebody is going to die over next. Also I should really bump this up to a 9 because of the marriage in this but you'll see that when you watch it. NOT IF, BUT WHEN!\\n\\n\r\nArt: Overall the art wasn't anything extraordinary however what gave it such a good feel was that in the game gear changes and throughout the anime their gear look also changes. And you know what's the best part? Kirito doesn't wear a gay ass orange jumpsuit! He wears a manly mans Black coat that only proceeds to look more badass as the anime continues. On top of that the art work really captures the feel of the RPG and the players within. But truly the most outstanding feature is all the costumes and the work and design put into them. \\n\\n\r\nSound: I gave sound a 6 which probably isn't fair because when I'm watching an anime RARELY do I pay attention to the sound track in the back that happens to be playing. And if I do then I soon forget about it. So in light of the fact that I'm not going to go back and rewatch episodes just to tell you if the sound is good you're just going to have to trust me when I say it doesn't suck. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: My god what can I REALLY say about the characters? Despite all the flaws to this anime's storyline the character development makes you completely forget all about it. I LOVED the characters. Let me repeat this. I LOVED THE CHARACTERS IN SAO! The main hero was a hero. Asuna was rude and (forgive me for saying so) bitchy in the starting episodes. Distant from kirito and everyone else. However seeing her and kirito slowly start to come together made my heart melt and made me appreciate and love this anime so much. Besides these two main characters the side characters are lovely as well. Whenever they'd show kirito's friend the blacksmith (forgive me for no name) I loved it. Because not only did the designers have the main characters develop they had the side unimportant characters develop too. If you were to see another character again you can guarantee that they would have different armor and perhaps an altered personality due to the game. Lovely in every aspect. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10 overall. Really the thing holding this back for me is the part two of this anime and the fact that they made them scaling 100 floors to beat the game such a small part of the anime itself. I would have loved to see this be made into an 80 possible plus episodes showing the difficulties and trials on the floors with some fillers on some of the more interesting floors. However what they didn't do with the anime isn't going ot make me drop my score for it. An easy solid 8 if I've ever watched one. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: An 8. To those who are saying this anime isn't that great blah blah blah. You can all go back to watching your Naruto and bleach animes. This is a unique one of a kind heartwarming show that deserves to be watched. If you don't like it after episode 3 then stop watching but I can almost positively say you will want to finish it.",

            "content": "Sword Art Online[SAO] is a tricky anime to review. While I usually keep my reviews personal, I think SAO is something that should be approached only after you've researched it, because if you haven't, you may end up disappointed. Badly.\r\nI'll start off by saying that I am an avid fan of the .hack/// series. I grew up with it, and even though it's not the first or best \"Virtual Reality Game\" anime, it always brought something new to the table in all of it's branches and reboots. My initial reaction to SAO was mixed, I knew it was trying to ride off of .hack///'s success,but I was really intrigued by it's greatest feature- the fact that ALL players who die in the game die in real life. \\n\\n\r\n     Kirito is your average MMORPG nerd- terrible in real life and completely absorbed in his video games. Fortunately for him, SAO offers the chance to transition to an almost real world where he's unbeatable. A beta tester for SAO, he rises to the top and when the game opens to the public, he's ready to do it again. Except this time, there is a new challenge. Players are unable to log out of SAO until someone beats the game's 100th floor(the equivalent of a level) because of an insane Game Master. Also, they die in the game, they die for real. Trying to avoid as many spoilers as possible, Kirito continues his typical behavior and becomes one of the most important, although not well known, players. With the help of Asuna, an ally from when he first started the game, he may very well be able to save everyone. \\n\\n\r\n     This is where things sound great. There are so many truly wonderful and new ways to handle the story from here. Perhaps a Game Master who desires the chance to play God? How glitches or government interference make the situation worse? A mystery on who you can actually trust in a game where you'll be backstabbed by anyone?  \\n\r\n     By far, the biggest and most salivating premise would be a study on human psychology. How would players react in this situation? The anime is really eager to answer that question. Actually I spoke too soon. It isn't. Throughout the anime (and light novels) we see some really genius moments. Some players form coalitions to save the rest. Others just hide in the beginning town, where they'll be safe. Beta testers use their advanced knowledge to grab the best training spots and compete. Some PK'ers question the truth of the game, believing that killing other players will actually liberate them from the system without frying their brain. Characters even begin to wonder whether the real world happened and if they'd really want to return.\\n\r\n     But this genius is hidden among the most terrible, convoluted and twisted plot pacing/story I've seen in almost all of modern media. You'll see these great ideas hidden behind pretentious filler and useless romance scenes. I've heard the comparison of SAO to a young otaku's wish fulfillment fanfiction. And that's pretty much accurate. There is so much harem in this anime that a wonderful setup is completely lost.  \\n\r\n    SAO's pacing and arrangement is just so awkward I had to make a section for it. In the original light novels, thing skip around to level 78 after the beginning. That really isn't too bad once it happens. There are some cute side stories later. But the producers of the anime decide to show those first. And there are a lot of those episodes. In fact, episodes 2-7 could be considered entirely unnecessary. Again, more harem. Nothing else. Then, once important and slightly enjoyable content rears it's head, we get more harem. And what, due to the childish look of the protagonists, could very well be an underage creepy marriage. Oh, and an .Hack/// Aura clone that is somehow even harder to care about because she's just so dang annoying.  \\n\r\n     Unfortunately, the second arc doesn't solve much. Without spoiling too much, it's a very very very disappointing move, and while some may not mind, it's a terrible trope that ruins an already faltering storyline. \\n\r\n     Despite this, the first episode is possibly one of the most well composed and addicting openers in an anime. It explains just what it needs to, it doesn't give too much but it sets everything you need to know and really captures MMORPGS and the human psyche perfectly. Watch that even if you don't watch the rest because really, it's nearly perfect. \\n\\n\r\n     Characters. Ughhhh. Kirito is a badass Gary Stu. What tries to be character development is rushed and not character development but just extra sympathy for a character we already love. So Kirito is awesome and terrible as a character. Asuna is simply adding to the breast count, she's a straight up Mary Tsundere and also lacks emotional development.  Every other character is pretty much pointless and in only 1 or 2 episodes, with no time for emotional attachment. \\n\\n\r\n    The art is a moot point. The backgrounds are truly great at times and really show the expanse and varying floors of SAO. But the art is just standard if slightly better than average. I will admit though, the menu screens for players that hover around them are really neatly done and very consistent. Don't ask why I love them so much, but they get the art score an entire extra point. Character designs are great, although when you're doing designs for characters for an MMORPG, that's not hard. I have small issues with how the producers tried to make the game seem like an MMORPG, because when they do it right, they succeed really well with AI messages and drop down menus. But they just don't do it often enough. Sound is good, not much to complain about. The MMORPG sounds are all really well done and quite modern. \\n\\n\r\n    And well, there is the real issue with SAO. Both the light novels and anime ruin a fantastic premise, but the anime does it even worse(the later novels of the light volume, uncovered by the anime, are surprisingly experimental and are more like science fiction than your typical adventure light novel; I highly recommend reading the series just for them). In a conceptual phase, this anime is godlike. When actually produced, it's a sad specimen. But really, don't let that failure get in the way of your enjoyment. Because while SAO doesn't do everything right, it's still a nice anime. It's not as effective or compelling as it should be, but if you liked .hack///  you'll probably get something enjoyable out of it. Maybe one day, a reboot will come and fix everything. Until then, Sword Are Online is a piece of milk chocolate with just 3 decadent hazelnut flakes mixed in. When you hit one, the taste resonates. When you don't, it's just chocolate. But chocolate isn't bad, it's just... chocolate.   \\n\\n",

            "content": "There are two types of adaptations. The first type tries to be enjoyable by itself for both people who know the source material and those who don't. The second type's reason for existence is to serve as advertisment to source material and other merchandise. After reading the original novels and watching first 3 episode I can say Sword Art Online anime is the second kind.\r\nFirst episode is adapted perfectly and nicely explains things about the death game, that 10000 people got trapped into. It also introduces main character and few side characters. But the second one already rushes the whole plot a lot forward. Theyleave out many scenes that define main characters and explain their motivations. They also try to introduce new scenes that make up for the exposition lost during cuts, but they fail horribly. Third episode is same, albeit little better. They left out less exposition and scenes, but thats because original material was much shorter than for second episode.\\n\r\nThanks to this, it won't be surprising if many people are be confused by character's actions and ask 'Why?\" and \"How?\" many times during those two episodes and even future ones. The feeling of rushed plot is felt even by people who didn't read the novels and that is saying something.\\n\r\nLater episodes probably won't be better.They are obvious trying to adapt as much original material as possible while not having any reason to keep the storyline and character development solid.\\n\r\nOnly good thing about this adaptation is great visual directing, attention to visual detail and Yuki Kajiura's soundtrack. But this is far from enough to make this enjoyable watch.\\n\\n\r\nAfter finishing the anime, it seems I was right.",

            "content": "Spoilers Ahead.\r\nTens of thousands of players trapped in an MMO, forced to battle their way out? The concept of Sword Art Online was promising. The setting was in an MMORPG - an expansive, huge fantasy world filled with thousands of quests and monsters. It offers near limitless possibilities - as any MMORPG player will tell you.\r\nUnfortunately, SAO really fails to capture any of the things that make MMORPGs fun to play. It takes off in a direction that few people were expecting and leaves many dissatisfied and disappointed by the waste of creative potential. SOA falls short in many regards, but especially in terms ofits plot and characters.\\n\\n\r\n\"In the near future, a Virtual Reality Massive Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (VRMMORPG) called Sword Art Online has been released where players control their avatars with their bodies using a piece of technology called Nerve Gear. One day, players discover they cannot log out, as the game creator is holding them captive unless they reach the 100th floor of the game's tower and defeat the final boss. However, if they die in the game, they die in real life. Their struggle for survival starts now...\" (Source: Crunchyroll)\\n\\n\r\nThis synopsis doesn't accurately reflect what the anime is about. It's the premise set up by the first two episodes, but is soon forgotten and is even abandoned by the 15th episode. What supposedly should be the major conflict of the story takes a backseat to what's really just a love story between Kirito and Asuna. Brief spasms of plot development occur every now and then, but are so poorly thought out that it often leaves the viewer baffled and confused. SAO uses time skips gratuitously - skipping forward two years within the first few episodes. In this time, characters become exponentially more powerful without any backstory. Characters aren't given time to develop and the episodes  themselves are often extensive tangents to the main story. These tangents introduce a multitude of characters that usually don't play any role later except for cameo appearances. It baffles me trying to understand this direction of story telling. Kayaba Akihiko traps thousands of players within his virtual world, making death permanent and forces them to play his game. There is a lot of potential within answering the big question of \"why?\" But SAO never truly gives an answer for this question. Apparently even Kayaba Akihko can't tell you why he trapped players in another world. This \"plot\" is so lackluster that it's really not an accurate synopsis of the anime. The overall feeling given off by the haphazard side quests doesn't remotely reflect the desperation and hopelessness characters talk about.\\n\\n\r\nThere are also a variety of MMORPG things that either don't exist or, when translated into reality, come across as pretty ridiculous and hard to take seriously. There's no animosity for beta players. The idea of a beater (combination of \"beta\" and \"cheater\") is completely unheard of. No guild would disband because of a loot drop conflict. Nobody thinks sharing an inventory is romantic. SAO focuses a lot on trivial aspects of MMOs without really noting the more notable things. \\n\\n\r\nThe abrupt shift from Sword Art Online to Alfheim Online was pretty poorly done and confusing to the viewer. Sword Art Online had not really been fleshed out before it suddenly vanished from the anime - out of the 100 floors, major events take place in maybe three or four. The ultimate resolution of the main conflict is resolved within a few minutes with deux ex machina with no prior plot development, making for a very unsatisfactory conclusion to the world. The second arc of the anime does have a marginally better plot, but really only because there's a clear goal and stays on focus towards this goal. While it is the typical damsel in distress plotline, Sugou, as a villain, is pretty implausible. The concept of a random older man obsessed with marrying a comatose teenager and almost succeeding is pretty far-fetched and frankly, outright ridiculous. Again, Kirito defeats Sugou with the use of deux ex machina and saves Asuna from the perverted clutches of Sugou (Episodes 21 and 24 are pretty weird.) Kirito's cousin Sugu becomes a prominent figure in this arc...but the question really is why? What purpose does replacing the clear romantic interest with another romantic interest (a cousin, no less) do for the series?\\n\\n\r\nKirito is a pretty straightforward main character. He's brave, heroic, determined, altruistic, kind, and just - the embodiment of the typical hero character. He's fairly ridiculously strong - given the protection of the deux ex machina. Things occur that are nonsensical according to the anime, but Kirito overcomes through sheer willpower, apparently. When he gets killled in Sword Art Online, he just decides not to die (\"A true man never dies, even when he's killed\").  His ability to resolve major conflicts in the story by realizing something is second to none.\\n\\n\r\nAsuna is possibly the most inconsistent character out of any anime I've watched. When she is introduced, she is distant, quiet, and mysterious. She's seen wearing a cloak with a hood that covers her face and talks very little. But a few episodes later, she's the assertive co-leader of the knights of blood. Given, two years has passed, but the complete 180 in personality is still notable. A few episodes later, she's no longer assertive or distant. She turns into a typical lovey-dovey opposite for the male lead. Asuna, on numerous occasions, demonstrates remarkable swordmanship and competence - dispatching scores of enemies or even killing a boss. She then loses any ability to fend for herself once in Alfheim Online and is reduced to your standard damsel in distress. \\n\\n\r\nThe romance between Kirito and Asuna begins abruptly and doesn't have much plausibility. Asuna is horrendously underdeveloped - again, the time skip has prevented the viewer from watching much of the interaction between Kirito and Asuna - before she becomes unconditionally devoted to Kirito and they get married (in SAO). She really has no reason to do so. The next few episodes are a strange collection of married life - they move into a cabin together, they get a kid(like thing), and they live together.\\n\\n\r\nNow wait. Isn't SAO supposed to be an action anime? Why are there so many episodes about married life? The divisive focus of the anime chooses to really hone in between the love between Kirito and Asuna. But anyways...\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast is very secondary and plays few roles aside from simply being there. Even Sugu, who is introduced as the the main female character in the second arc, is unquestionably secondary because the romance between Kirito and Asuna is already so established. You already know she's a placeholder. Klein and Agil are given so little time to develop that they're really only known as friends of Kirito.\\n\\n\r\nFrom an objective viewpoint, the story and characters of SAO are very bad. It is very poorly executed. There were plenty of promising ideas that ultimately came to naught.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, there are some positive features about the anime that still give some form of enjoyment. The sound and art are superb. SAO is a gorgeous anime. Character designs are well-made.\\n\\n\r\nOn some level, I really want to like SAO. It's the epitome of a geek's escapist fantasy. People play MMORPGS escape the confines of reality - to be able to fight monsters, quest, fly, have adventures, whatever. It would be an awfully tempting offer to live in an MMO world as your character. SAO offers, in some form or another, a glimpse into this fantasy. It manages to connect in, really, just due to its premise. But with all its faults, SAO becomes more and more difficult to associate with as the anime drags on. Things get more and more ridiculous and the plot loses any semblance of plausibility. At the very end, you're left with a disappointing, unfulfilled anime that didn't live up to its full potential.",

            "content": "You know, this anime reminds me of another great anime ive had the pleasure of watching. I believe it was called Boku no Pico. both shows share a very similar characteristic, they are both super gay. \r\nI mean never have I seen so much butthole lovin in the first episode of a show. Kirito and Klein reminded me so much of the two mains (Pico) and (guy who i forgot the name of) from Boku no pico. \r\nSo much ass ramming in one episode was just to much for me to handle, my nips started lactating. OH! but enough about me and my fetishes foryoung boys! lets get to the review!\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nAh, Sword Art Online, an anime that somehow got popular and by some is seen as the \"best anime of all time\". I beg to differ, People can get mad and try to defend this piece of shit all they want, they can tell me my opinion is garbage and that i don't know what im talking about and yeah maybe you're right, maybe im being to harsh on SAO. \\n\r\nbut im sorry, if you even remotely enjoyed this heaping pile of steaming sloth shit then you are either suffering from what we like to call mental retardation or you're a faggot who likes to insurt themselves into the lame generic MC of a protagonist that this show likes to make you believe is so \"perfect\". Let me share with you why this show is nothing more than another generic harem with shitty romance.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nOk I admit, the first episode of this show had me hooked. I mean the idea of being in a VR MMO was just awesome, the world even looked promising and seemed so cool at first, the idea of being trapped inside a videogame and being able to die sounded truly terrifying and even sounded believable when explaining that leaving the game in anyway would kill you! \\n\r\nBut then everything changed when the time skipping attacked, yep that's right, after about episode 2 this show starts fuckin skipping important scences that are relevant to the storyline. \\n\r\nFor example the last episode you watched could of been Kirito fingering Asuna's (or Kleins) love hole and then when the ending theme roles and you move on to the next episode, Kirito is suddenly being raped by that one big black guy. But all jokes aside, my point is this show doesn't explain shit, it treats the person watching like an idiot.\\n\r\nThe show has two story arcs, the first is of course SAO and the second is Alfiem online, im not even gonna talk about the second half of this show, it was so bad that if I had to choose between getting Ebola or watching that shitty second half again I think you know which one I would pick, and what makes matters worse is they could of seriously made this show good by not doing that and just using the 24 episodes to focus on SAO, but NOPE they had to cram SAO into the first 12 episodes and use Alfiem online for the other 12, i mean why? What purpose was there for doing this? what were they smoking when they tried doing this? \\n\r\nDid they all have an agreement and said YEP! LETS NOT WAIT TIL SEASON 2 TO DO ALFIEM ONLINE! INSTEAD LETS CRAM AS MUCH SHIT INTO 24 EPISODES AS WE POSSIBLY CAN!! IT'S GENIUS!! GENIUS I TELL YOU!!\\n\r\nSigh, oh well im done, fuck it, im moving on.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nit was good, I mean what do you want me to say? it wasn't bakemonogatari good that's for sure but it wasn't terrible or anything, anyways yeah Asuna's ass got me a little turned on a few times so I guess they did pretty good on that.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nProbably the best part, I mean seriously I love the music in this anime! I mean god I have like every ending and opening to this anime on my phone, and listen to them on a daily basis, it's that good! Also character voices are good and shit, but idgaf about that, i just like the soundtrack.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nOne word, Generic.\\n\r\nSeriously the characters are just so damn dull, I mean I just couldn't love them at all. Kirito is seriously the most over rated MC in all of history, he looks just like your average harem protagonist and yet everyone loves this guy so much? why? what's so special about him? because he's good at videogames? oh, well im pretty good at counter strike, where are my adoring fans? maybe it's because I don't get as many bitches as kirito does, I mean Klein was a pretty fine bitch. so I guess that's why everyone loves Kirito so much being able to score some ass like that.\\n\r\nThen there are all the other none important characters they try to get you to care about, about the only good character at first was Asuna until the second half she turned into fuckin Rapunzel and had to be saved by our generic MC, but enough about the characters, they suck, the end.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI get more enjoyment out of torturing my sister with my deadly ass farts, I found nothing good about this show except the wonderful soundtrack, other than that it was an awful experience and I hope the 10 people who are actually reading this review will heed my warnings and not watch this failed abortion.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMy overall score is;  one failed abortion/10 \\n\\n",

            "content": "Before you hit the not helpful button hear me out, I know as an anime sword art has many flaws, such as pace and consistency. However if you don't look at it as trying to be the next fate zero or code geass and instead look at it as an enjoyable anime that you can sit back and watch in a relaxed way just like you would an action tv show or comedy.\r\nThe story of Sword Art Online I have mixed feelings about as I love the concept of the VMMORPG and having to fight for your life and peoples reactions to the situation theyare forced into such as, Denying it, stepping up as a leader, Being a whiny B****or being a player killing fucktard. A large part of the pros of sword art online is that it does a great job of portraying all of this to the viewer in a short easy to understand way, it also does a good job of keeping into the MMO theme that they introduced and it remains consistent throughout the story that that is the environment they are in with constant references to how people play MMOs in real life like brief character interactions and forming clans with friends and going on raids. My problem with Sword Art Online is that it is too rushed, the first half only being about 14 episodes where it could of easily of been done in 30 and then the second half in another 30 episodes, but considering the first half took place over 2 years it lead to alot of timeskips to key events this leads to a waste of potential at times and a character who seems to get infinitly stronger every episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art of the shows amazing the studio seems to of put a large amount of effort into the art style especially the battles which were done amazingly, another note about the art is the contrast between the art when they are in the virtual world (Lots of bright colors and well lit) compared to the real world where it is slightly darker and more grey (but not to the extent of taking away from it) this adds to the series themes.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was one of the best parts of the show the music that plays during battles gets me pumped up and sitting on the edge of my seat, and the two openings of the series do a good job of getting you into the feel of the two parts, Crossing Fields by LiSA does an outstanding job of getting you into the feel of the hectic and serious nature of the first half of the story and Innocence does quite a good job of portraying the more lighthearted feel of the second ark.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters in sword art online is one of its weaknesses, the biggest one is Asuna who goes from a character with the potential to be so strong and independent, to the female sidekick second best to the Protagonist and then to basically princess peach, this upset me so much as I had such high hopes for her as a character. Kirito's development is kind of strange and he is prone to having drastic changes in personality, one episode he is the badass rouge player who fights alone the next he is an angsty bitch (didnt last too long though) and then the next second he is the caring big brother type person. However all these changes do take place in between time jumps so it may be passed off as consistent growth over time and he does stay true to his characterization of being the best player in the game and how he will be a motivator for others. All the other secondary characters dont get much development but that could be seen as a plot device involving the one off encounters you see in an MMORPG.\\n\\n\r\nAs a whole I thought the series was really enjoyable it had a good mix of battles and fun and romance, it didn't go out of its way to try and be great but it always left me wanting more, personally I believe it is this years best anime. But I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who takes all show to seriously and have to try and find hidden meanings to everything cause it is pretty much straight a forward show.",

There is no character development what so ever. Their reaction are exactly what every stereotype would do, but what's disgusting, it's that they aggrandize it so much making them totally not believable.\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment was very pathetic.  I mean I was so hype because of all the great reviews but in the end I could hardly stay up and watch it.  I kept telling my self it's going to get better. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I gave this anime a 2.  \\n\\n\r\nThere is still hope there are still some unpredictables things that I want to know so I will keep on watching.",

            "content": "I'm going to keep this short, nothing too in-depth, just focussing on the major points that make the series.\r\nStory (3/10)\r\n-\r\nSword Art Online had a good base to start off from; players stuck in a virtual reality game, not to say it's a new concept, but it certainly opens up to many different paths the story could take. I personally felt that SAO threw away that opportunity and instead chose to cram in as much useless junk as they could. They spent the majority of the episodes adding useless, one episode-appearing characters that were barely built up on, and other times simply threw in relationships andadd-ons -such as Kirito's abilities and high stats- on a whim. The sub-plot of Kirito and Asuna's relationship seemed to appear from almost nowhere, having met each other only a few times before awkwardly advancing in their relationship. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the story did not make use of it's potential and instead chose the latter of a lowly built, simple focussed story.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10/10)\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nThe art actually left a nice impression compared to some of the other downsides of this anime. It was filled with many beautifully made sceneries, as well as nice character designs -most being side characters- and beautiful shading and colour combinations. They made very good use of this for the fantasy setting they had, especially the scenery!\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10)\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nNot much to say for this, average sound at most parts, but very nice and anticipating battle music!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (2/10)\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nThis was the main downside to the series, in my opinion. In the first half of the series they introduced quite a few characters that only made an appearance for one episode, these episodes took up quite a bit of the first half of the series, and these characters barely got any development! The only character that got any real development was Kirito, although Suguha was later added and given a fair share of development. Even Asuna became a bland character, where did she come from? What is her back story? Though she was one of the main characters, none of this was revealed. This downside made it hard to connect with any character aside from Kirito and Suguha.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, it felt like they went with quantity over quality with the characters. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7/10)\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nThis section is based off of my personal feelings toward the series. \\n\r\nAlthough I gave quite a few low grades on the show, I personally enjoyed it quite a lot. This could be because I'm an Fantasy MMORPG junky and this appealed to me on a large scale, but I did find most episodes exciting enough to keep me watching. I just wish the battles were more relatable to that of an RPG as opposed to a hack-and-slash style, as it would fit it's image better.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (4/10)\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nThe show isn't really anything special, it does get quite a lot of hype that may or may not be deserved depending on the viewer. It's like any other anime, it will attract many, repel many, and simply lure people who like to hate on over-hyped fads. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, it's up to you whether you choose to like it or dislike it, this is just my two cents!\\n",

            "content": "I want to start off by saying, even if you have read some bad reviews and are turned off, I strongly encourage you to at least give Sword Art Online a try. It does have its flaws but just because those imperfections are there doesn't mean you can't sit back and enjoy it, which many end up doing and which you might. Many enjoy it for the entertainment rather than for a strong message or strong plot. So I say at least watch the first three episodes before deciding whether to drop or not.\r\nOkay going into the review. \r\nStory: The concept is cool. Trapped ina game with the possibility of death. Who wouldn't be anxious, worried and completely terrified? It's fun to think about and is what immediately grabs much of the audience. We do end up drifting away from this and getting lost in a romance, which I do have a problem with and will talk more about in the character portion.  8/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is crisp and modern, the scenery is beautiful and the fight scenes are superb. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: Kirito's voice actor is probably one of the top two best voice actors I have ever heard. The sounds he makes when he fights and the noises he makes when he cries... just... wow A+. Also, the OSTs are beautiful and heartfelt and the opening and end songs are very enjoyable. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Here is where I find the majority of the problem in my opinion (although, the plot straying into a romance is part of the problem as well). There are three episodes where Kirito has a story with three different girls. Episode 3 with Sachi, Episode 4 with Silica and Episode 7 with Liz. Episode 3, contrary to what other reviewers say, is my favorite episode and I think it truly stresses the situation of being trapped in a death game. These three girls I feel like are 100% more realistic than Asuna is and Asuna is the main female protagonist who appears in MANY of the episodes while the other girls only get ONE episode. Asuna to me is an extremely flat character. She is perfect in every way. She is your strong female character who is incredibly fast with her sword. She's beautiful and her character development is one minute she's sharp but she immediately softens in like one episode. The problem I have is that Asuna is not real. She has absolutely no flaws. Kirito and her fall in love almost instantly, literally in one episode they go from partners to lovers. And she actually becomes a damsel in distress. There is no smooth transition of her changing, she just automatically loves Kirito and is automatically this perfect girl for him. All she is is fanservice and her and Kirito's love seems very artificial and spontaneous. I much rather have had Sachi, Silica and Liz alongside Kirito than Asuna. I even love Suguha (Kirito's \"sister\") more than Asuna because she is realistic, she goes through things that many of us have, she is pained, she is troubled, she feels real and she feels sincere while Asuna is an unrelatable blank slate. Because I enjoyed all the characters except Asuna 7/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I enjoyed this so much. I was hype every week to watch a new episode, I was cheering, I was crying, I was happy and I was angry. The drama is great and the fights get you pumped.  Even the flaws made it enjoyable because overall I had a great time yelling at my computer screen. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n*~ I have read some chapters of the light novel and I can already say that the light novel discusses the features of the game more in-depth than the anime does. The anime tried to fit two volumes of the light novels into one season, so this is probably why the romance is highlighted more because they just couldn't fit everything in. I suggest reading the light novels if you are more interested in the gaming aspect.\\n",

            "content": "I'm going to be straight up about everything and concede early on that SAO deserves almost all the criticisms that have been thrown its way. However, I think it is still a very enjoyable series despite every flaw it has. \r\nLet's start with the negatives.\r\nThe perhaps most glaring problem with the series is that it's tried to compress too much material into 25 episodes. In total, it's adopted 4 volumes of the light novel. What that translates into are gaps in character development and plot explanations. While it's not all that difficult to follow the story, pacing suffered quite noticeably in the first arc, especiallybecause the anime tried to present everything in a chronological manner when the LN itself used more of a flashback progression. The second arc might've been delivered enough story without rushing anything, but the directors could've hardly expected anyone to stay for the series if they didn't like the 14 episodes of first arc. \\n\\n\r\nAll that would've been fine if SAO had a great plot and a great cast. The only thing I can say about the plot is that it's as linear as anything you'll see. Details aside, the endings to each arc should be pretty clear from the outset. As for the characters, we have a main character who fits the ideal nice guy mold. Next to him is the ideal girlfriend female lead. Then you have the supporting cast featuring some more stereotypical good friend, lonely genius, pathetic nerd, and bitter villain types. Little else needs to be said here.\\n\\n\r\nSo why watch this series then? For me, the real beauty of SAO comes in when you try to immerse yourself in the world the series tries to create. And for all it's worth, the world invites your imaginations to run wild. \\n\\n\r\nPlus, even though the LN was written some time ago, the concept is still a decent one -- people trapped in a virtual reality MMORPG where hp = 0 means death in real life. As linear as the plot is, over the course of the series there are still some legitimate depth in the questions it raises. For one, when people can practically live in the virtual world, how would you differentiate between virtual and real? It seems like a rather trivial question, but it is eventually something society will have to address when technology reaches that point. Maybe we'll even see something like SAO in our lifetime. \\n\\n\r\nAnd as bland as the character molds are, they make for a fun and likable cast.  Though some people make the character out to be just another Gary Stu, he is far from all-powerful and suffers from a number of flaws, as he often admits. The female lead may be quite flawless on the outside, but the insecurities she expresses as a typical obedient daughter are not only real but pretty relatable. The series doesn't try to paint everything over with a gloomy brush, which means even while the cast struggles with the difficulties ahead, they remain generally optimistic and forward-looking. The ending featuring their interactions is heartwarming, even, as they've probably grown on you by this point.\\n\\n\r\nOne short comment each on the miscellaneous components. The action sequences are short and very, very sweet in this series. Even though on a couple of occasions the art quality drops somewhat, it looks great across the board and is probably one of the most pretty looking this season. The sound is nothing astounding, but it's definitely ahead of the pack. The opening and ending for the second arc deserves particular praise.\\n\\n\r\nSAO can be a hit-or-miss. If you're an optimist with an open mind and some appetite for fantasy, action, and adventure, SAO is definitely for you. If you're on the other hand someone who prefers out-of-the-box ideas and intricate plot progression, then SAO is probably not the best idea. Anyone in the middle should at least try this series out. It has its flaws for sure, but from my experience, it's been an entertaining and satisfying ride.",

            "content": "Sword Art Online is what happens when you have an interesting premise but the execution is so poor. It doesn't become a forgettable experience as it should be but a polarizing one, with some willing to overlook some huge defects and others wondering how on earth this got so popular in the first place.\r\nThe premise is great because it ticks a lot of boxes in the target audience: It talks about MMORPGS, it reminds us of how great fully immersive virtual reality should be, it raises the typical questions about identity, behaviour and personality in virtual environments and with the danger element added in thefirst episode in essence it adds more depth merging the virtual reality of the game with the value of real life. Addressing most of this stuff lightly or not should be easily 9-10/10 material, too bad the focus is lost so easily.\\n\\n\r\nAs other reviews have pointed out, the main problems with SAO are in the atrocious way the story develops (pacing and deus ex machina elements mainly) and in the bland personality of the characters (see Kirito's jacket joke) but in my opinion the problem wasn't after the first 2 episodes but rather at the very first, after the villain appears. Why? because after that point we already can see how SAO isn't aiming for proper depth or consistency. The lack of purpose is clear when after such an important announcement the story just focuses on Kirito brushing aside anything about the real world, their connected bodies, the impact on everyone else, and everything else such setting can offer.\\n\\n\r\nWhat happens next is an afterthought, a few episodes later Kirito is already the strongest player in the game, acts like a poor man's Kenshiro, gets every lady he meets fall in love with him due to his strength in the game (I guess it's not that outlandish as they're teenagers after all, but every single one?), falls into artificial love with Asuna, a case study for character involution (and it's a poorly done romance too) and defeats the villain with a textbook Deus Ex Machina (Willpower vs God). Everything is mildly enjoyable at best, the world was fun to watch but makes little of the opportunities it really had and the comments about a virtual reality world and how it affects the player never go past three lines so 5/10 I guess,  but that's not the end.\\n\\n\r\nAfter SAO is finished for some reason they decided to adapt the second part of the light novels to the anime, on hindsight a very poor idea. This part introduces a new character, which being female naturally falls in love with Kirito. It also shows how great Kirito is at this, rescuing his love interest in a new, different MMORPG in a single week. The anime does try to make sense of this but it fails miserably, the holes are just too big for the arguments to withstand any basic questioning. Once again cute world and all but at this point we endured 24 episodes of the same frustrating stuff, which really hinders the enjoyment you can get from it.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it finished I was left with tho sensations, the first one being the Virtual Reality and MMORPG things were there for the sake of it (which is quite a shame, the idea is really good) and the second one being the idea that I could make a better story based on this premise myself. Most likely thing is I can't but, was this so badly executed that it actually encourages those feelings in most people? apparently yes, based on reviews here.\\n\\n\r\nWhat a wasted opportunity\\n\\n\r\nStory 3/10\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\r\nCharacter 1/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment 3/10 \\n\\n\r\nOverall 22/5 = 4.4\\n\\n\r\nYou should watch at least = With 4 episodes you can already see how everything it's going to be.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Sword Art Online is, without a doubt, the most popular and controversial anime of 2012. The Sword Art Online, or SAO, community is split into two groups. The people who think it's the best, and people who think it's the worse. I, personally, am on the latter, but I would like to voice my opinion. I also will not be talking about flaws from the second season for spoilers sake.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story for SAO started out very strong. The concept of SAO was similar to the .Hack series, except SAO would hopefully have less talking. Being trapped in a virtual reality MMO where if you diein the game you die in real life is basically ever nerds dream. Imagine a virtual reality Skyrim, except the game is extremely difficult and 200 out of the 10,000 players die on the first boss dungeon. However, the story has massive time skips which prevents from establishing a true sense of fear. Everyone adjusts to Sword Art Online almost instantaneously because of the time skips. It also leads to bad character development, but I'll get into that later. The story gets kicked in the teeth in the second half as if the first half was just a prologue, not to mention it wasn't nearly as good as the first half's story. 6/10\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nThe animation in SAO is actually very good. Animated by A1-Pictures, who previously have done such anime as Ao No Exorcist and Fairy Tail, have done a very good job with this anime. Every frame is detailed with great lighting, and the action is fast paced and runs at a consistent frame-rate. I think my favorite fight scene was in episode 9, when Kirito, the main character, was fighting the 74th boss, Gleam Eyes, and he pulled a trick out of his ass. That was a very well animated fight. However, the animation in the 2nd half is not as good. It's still good, but not as good as the first half. If the animation were consistently good, it would get a 9. But no. It got an 8. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe OST of this anime was composed by Yuki Kajiura. Yuki Kajiura has fame from such anime as Fate/Zero and Madoka Magica. The music in SAO was very well constructed, with the battle theme being one of my favorites. I also liked the song \"Fight!\", as it reminded me of the beautiful M12 + 13 from Kara no Kyoukai, another one of Kajiura's works. There's really nothing else to say other than it's great.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nAnd here's where SAO took a giant dump on itself. Because of the aforementioned time skips, the characters have no time to develop, especially the main character Kirito. The most I got out of him was that he's a badass dude who wears black clothes and plays solo and can win any match. Notice that he plays solo, which any MMO player can tell you is never a good idea. I play Monster Hunter, which isn't exactly an MMO, but it's still fairly similar. I can't even beat any of the bosses without help from a friend online, and that's what made the 2nd episode of SAO so great. He had help from the female lead, Asuna, to kill the first boss. After that he gets black clothes and suddenly he can beat even a dragon by himself. Speaking of Asuna, she's not much better than Kirito. She's introduced as an awesome character in Episode 2, but then she just turns into a tsundere (person, mainly female, who shuns a protagonist before getting to know the person and she lightens up and becomes a love interest) who got no character development because of the time skips. Same with Kirito and Asuna's love for each other. In episode 10, they get married, which is great. The only problem is that in episode 2, it was 2022. In episode 10, it was 2024. Asuna was also shoved out of the spotlight so the side characters can come in and be there for ONE EPISODE. You can imagine why this kind of love interest is bad. It gets even worse in Season 2, when Asuna goes and a new girl protagonist is introduced. She's even worse than Asuna. 4/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: \\n\r\nI think SAO had SO MUCH WASTED POTENTIAL. It could have been a fantasy epic set in an inescapable virtual world, like Fate/Zero in World of Warcraft. But the story and characters marred it so much that it's almost unbearable to watch. SAO gets a 4/10.",

            "content": "This is my own opinion, but I think the storyline is almost perfect in this anime. Several events relate to the main one, and gives it a bit more depth perception and understanding. This anime features a lot of action and talking, but the music during battles is what makes this anime really shine out. It may not seem much, but you feel the music just flow through you when the characters fight against a boss. I would have to say though that the events are really squished together. This anime focuses on a world where the players need to defeat the final boss towin, but it skips several months in between. There is almost a different story each episode, which may or may not appeal to you guys, but it is at least entertaining to watch. Some comedy and heavy romance are present throughout this anime, as well as very emotional stories. The animation is very good, and each character or boss has unique looks. If you plan to watch this, I would not recommend that you read the manga first as it would take out all the fun in watching it the first time.",

            "content": "Sword Art Online sucks. I could stop here and that'd be all you needed to know, but I won't. I'll explain why this thing is terrible and in no way deserves the hype/scores/praise/fanboyism it gets.\r\nSword Art Online tells the story of Kirito, a gamer that gets stuck in a virtual reality MMO along with thousands of others. Their only way of escaping is to completely clear 100 levels of a tower, each progressively harder than the last. Oh, and if you die in the game your virtual reality gear in real life microwaves your brain. Interesting, no? Well, surprise, I'm actually going to say yes.Despite my opening sentence, the premise behind this anime is great. The stakes are high, it's a cool, unique setting and there were the beginnings of interesting characters. So what happened?\\n\\n\r\nNothing. And that's the problem.\\n\\n\r\nLet's talk about the story, or the lack thereof. You might think, from both my brief summary and the synopsis above, that this anime would deal with clearing the floors, the epic struggle to finish the game. Spoiler! It does not. When the timeline isn't having an epileptic fit you get, at most, a brief summary of what floor is currently being cleared. That's it. Cool battles? Nope. Heart breaking loss? Hell no. How about filler episodes in what amounts to a 12-13 episode anime? No fu-oh wait.\\n\\n\r\nThe majority of the episodes in the Sword Art Online arc (the last, roughly, half of the anime is set in a different MMO entirely, which has its own problems but I'll get to that later) are completely pointless. A handful of them are devoted to Kirito helping, in one way or another, one of the few actual girls in the game world. When the episode is over, they've fallen in love with him and they play no further role in the story. I'm not even kidding. The entire episode feels like a gigantic waste of time and this happens MULTIPLE TIMES. Then there's an odd CSI-esque murder mystery that's based around an MMO term. It kind of works but it feels forced, like they just wanted the murder then scrambled to find an MMO reason for it to happen. Further, this goes for 2 episodes when it could easily have been wrapped up in one and, like everything else in this anime, amounts to nothing. And the few episodes before the end, which I won't spoil, are the worst. This is supposed to be an action fantasy anime, not a boring slice of life...I was going to say comedy, but it's not comedy. Or drama. It's just slice of life. You watch two people live their life together. Exciting!\\n\\n\r\nIf the SAO arc went for the full 24 episodes I could tolerate this kind of thing. A lot of animes have these \"filler\" episodes that give a break from the main story, maybe throwing in some character development or world building. I don't mind this. But in the case of a shortened arc, like SAO, they take away what precious little time the main story already has. You can't do this and expect to have anything resembling a respectable story. And since SAO did it, it's main storyline feels rushed and, frankly, stupid.\\n\\n\r\nI glossed over the second half of this anime to be honest. It's set in a world with fairies and elves and the main villain looks like a closest butterfly, who also screams like a girl. He's one of the least threatening villains I've ever seen, which only adds to the lack of tension that comes with the life or death stakes disappearing. See, the new MMO doesn't trap Kirito, or anyone really, so if they die they can just log back in later. I believe Asuna is in some kind of danger but it's not enough, especially when I don't like her anyway.\\n\\n\r\nWhich is a nice segue to start talking about the characters. Kirito himself, when not being a Stu, is a bland and empty shell existing purely for wish fulfillment. He's a loner badass that all the girls instantly fall in love with and is insanely powerful and is the hero who saves the day because he's the speshul. That is really all there is to him and that's all there ever was. There is no character development whatsoever for him throughout the entire series. There's a half hearted attempt at a tragic backstory, but it never resonates and, like so many other plot points in this anime, falls apart when confronted with logic. \\n\\n\r\nAsuna is the other main and I hate her. Aside from beginning as the literal definition of a tsundere, she eventually ends up as another useless female incapable of doing anything without Kirito. This does not a good character create. Further, the romance between the two feels so weird and oddly forced that it feels like it was written by someone who had never actually been in a relationship. It amounts to they spend some time together, eventually she cooks for him and then they're in forever love. There aren't any specific events that you can point to nor does it ever feel that their relationship is growing. They just end up being a couple because the writer says they are.\\n\\n\r\nAside from them there's a handful of girls that make one or two episode cameos and are never seen or heard from again (a slight exaggeration, I'll admit, but not far off either). Oh, and there's Klein, a caring but kind of goofy guy. He's my favourite by far but only gets limited screen time, likely because he's an actual character and would shine a light on everything Kirito lacks. But when he is around he easily steals the show. I thought they might play him as the comic relief, which I would have accepted if for no other reason than to see more of him, but that's just one more wasted opportunity this anime has.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation is fine and actually impressive in some instances, the boss battles standing out. Audio is also good, with no complaints from me. I'll say here that there's nothing technically wrong with this anime; in my opinion the production values come off as fairly high. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately it's everything else that comes up short. Impressive visuals can only get you so far and when you lack any good characters, development or even a good overarching storyline, you're bound for failure. How this gets so much praise is beyond me, but perhaps you can get some mindless enjoyment from it if your expectations are low.",

            "content": "(No Spoilers)\r\nSword Art Online is not the greatest anime ever made, as some 13 year old girls will tell you, neither is it a worthless ripoff of the .hack// series as others would say. But it is, in my most humble opinion, the best anime I've seen this season, and one I'll remember for years to come.\r\nThe story, as you may have heard, involves the characters being stuck in a virtual reality MMO, this concept is not wholly original, as mentioned the .hack// and a few other shows have taken this route before. However no other show in this 'genre' has ever immersed me inthe world as much as SAO, and thats worth mentioning. The story itself plays out interestingly, after entering the game and becoming trapped, the protagonist Kirito, a loner by nature, ventures off by himself to gain an advantage while other players remain confused. From this point the story takes on a \"Wandering Swordsman\" style of show, where every episode is in a different setting, usually with a significant amount of elapsed time since the previous episode, and Kirito uses his incredible skills to help someone new. While some people hated this, claiming the episodes were pointless fillers, I felt differently. Not only are some major characters introduced in these episodes, but it also reveales and develops Kirito's character. Eventually the sporadic episodes line up more and the series reaches a climax halfway through the 25 episodes, from here, the second half of the show wasn't quite as awe inspiring, or riveting, but it wasnt terrible either. The story, averaged across 25 episodes, was a solid 8.\\n\\n\r\nSAO's art is fantastic, from breathtaking landscapes, to character animations, to epic fight scenes, the show is beautiful from start to finish.\\n\\n\r\nSound is impressive as well, a solid soundtrack (and impressive opening theme, always a bonus) left me with no complaints, and character voice and sound effects were equally good.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in SAO left a little to be desired. While I feel the lead Kirito was the only truely three dimensional character (and some would argue even that) other characters still had a degree of depth. Asuna and Sugu, the love interests and female leads, both had fascinating relationships that developed with Kirito, and you learned alot about them through those interactions. However those moments came along with other scenes that left me wondering \"why is she doing that?\" or \"this feels kind of forced and cliche...\" Other characters are charming, sweet, funny, and sometimes lame, but their archetypes are ones you've seen before. Overall characters in SAO are an 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, SAO dosn't earn a 10 or even a 9 in story or characters, and in most cases, good art and sound dont make up for a lame story. And SAO isnt an exception, but SAO gets a 9 for enjoyment because of the vast, incredible world it builds. Being trapped in a video game with your life on the line sounds like a nightmare, but as the story progresses the viewer (like the characters) begin to realize the beauty of the world theyre living in. But I have to reveal my bias, as a casual MMO gamer, the setting and world did appeal to me more than it might to others. To put it another way, the game itself: Sword Art Online, would be a gamer's fantasy. From how the game operated, to the bosses, to the virtual reality, to everything else, SAO is what gamers hope we'll have in another 20 years, and seeing that in an anime was INCREDIBLY fun to watch, and would be for anyone like myself.\\n\\n\r\nOverall SAO is a solid 9/10. An above average story and characters, a sweet, if at times cliche romance, amazing action coupled with stellar art and sound, and a world that'll have you wishing, like countless others, that you could be 'trapped' in that game too, these are the things you can expect from SAO. If that sounds like your kind of show, watch, enjoy, and thank me later.",

            "content": "To begin with, the story is something that already is done before and done better in other places, in the saga of Hack, among others, of the rest, the story is very simple and armed so Kirito is always the center of attention. The first arc is very good, but the second is horrible, very horrible, a patetic villan, bad designs, a shitty harem, etc... Another thing that I didn't like, was the \"themporary jumps\", where Kirito starts from zero and a few chapters is Jesus, in this aspect this anime fail.\r\nOther thing is the romance, it which fails because it is not natural, andthe involved two are pretty bad characters.\\n\\n\r\nOver, the series doesn't know what it wants to be, if an anime of action where the characters have to fight for survival, or a slice-of-life harem within a video game with a bit of action, getting whole chapters of Kirito and Asuna talking and doing things.\\n\\n\r\nAlready by the chapter ten and something the series already is a disaster, and when it reaches the second arc is going to shit.\\n\\n\r\nIronically, the first chapters were a very good thing, explaining things about the mechanism of the game and trying to be something, but then it deflates in a brutal way by the aforementioned problems, the characters and the story are in general poorly developed by focusing on the main characters, causing a lot of problems and plot holes.\\n\\n\r\nIn general, the story is poorly written and poorly developed, 3/10.\\n\\n\r\nIn the characters, is wost, the protagonist is one of the worst protagonists ever seen, focused both make a God forgot to give a definite personality, so his personality changes as needed by the script, it goes from being an antisocial a very social being in a second, emo to happy, from unsafe to completely decided, etc..\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters can be defined in one sentence of a pair of words:\\n\\n\r\nAsuna is the love interest of the main character and is a useless tsundere.\\n\\n\r\nSuguha is the cousin/sister/whatever of Kirito and loves it.\\n\\n\r\nYui is a loli and loves Kirito.\\n\\n\r\nKlein is the best friend of the protagonist and secretly loves him.\\n\\n\r\nSugou has something with Asuna and hates Kirito, that it is a f**ing butterfly. do you see it?\\n\\n\r\nThe cast is very forgettable and have no personality any more than the book of cliches of  LN says, 1/10.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is very good when A-1 give you the desire to do something and makes a decent animation, there is moment where what stands out are the lighting effects, and the majority of the battles or are pseudo-animated or are pure frozen images, but when A-1 gets you desire to get something good, but the horrible designs the second arc going down too many points 2/10.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is composed by Yuki Kajiura, which is pure quality, and did a very good job, I must admit, 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nI have enjoyed several battles and moments, yet there was a very boring parts which occupied a large part of the series, 5/10.\\n\\n\r\nIn overall it could have been better series if it had taken advantage of the potential that he showed in the first chapters, but fell like a House of cards and term being something bad enough and not recommended, 1/10.",

            "content": "I enjoyed the first half of SAO. The first few episodes introduce you to an interesting concept and after that we get to see the main character explore the world of Sword Art Online. However after the first few episodes this series quickly starts to fall down hill. Sword Art Online starts to undergo a lot of problems which undoubtedly makes it a badly written series. \r\nThe characters for one are poorly constructed. Kirito lacks any sense of character. He is bland, ridiculously overpowered (without balance either) and lacks any sort of personality that makes him likable. The author fails to characterize characters and there'san overuse of rhetoric to compensate for the lack of characterization. The story lacks any insight into the protagonist's psychology, possibly a lack of dynamic psychology. Kirito's reaction to his sister being attracted to him (\"Oh, my sister has the hots for me? Mmmkay...\"). There's no character development either throughout the whole series due to the ridiculous time skips throughout the series which detracts from the overall quality of the story.\\n\\n\r\nThis series lacks the ability to deconstruct the situation past the first few episodes. How's the protagonist feeling? How are the citizens feeling? They may be immersed in this experience, but surely there are people who failed to adapt, right? This series is an enormous waste of potential. The first few episodes were promising but ultimately ended up being a series which focuses on romance and pointless harem. This series lacks any respect towards female characters to show off Kirito the invincible. Kirito's field of influence that turns independent girls into dependent girls that overly rely on him is an example of the bad writing this series contains.\\n\\n\r\nThis series also fails to explain some of the most basic things such as why the big bad of the first arc decided in imprisoning 10,000 players to their death. (\"1. Make cool game; 2. Trap Players 3. ??? 4. \\n\r\nPlayers Trapped!\"). This just leaves us with a stupid plot hole. This series antagonists are basically just caricatured villains.\\n\\n\r\nSword Art Online is a prime example of bad writing. Sword Art Online story resembles a fanfiction written by a 15 year old girl than it does a story written by a professional writer. I could literally write 4000 words (easily) as to why this anime is bad. How this anime managed to garner such a large fanbase in the first place has literally left me speechless. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nNormally I stick to reviewing old anime that are long past their peak of popularity or overlooked anime that never got popular in the first place. Today, ima jump the shark and review Sword Art Online! Why the hell not?\r\nStory: 3/10\r\nAs you the reader are probably aware, Sword Art is another entry in the \"trapped in a videogame\" sub-genre of science fiction. Yes, it has been done so many times it is now officially a genre. The first entry was Disney's Tron in the early 1980s and then it was actually a cool and unique idea. Then came Nintendo's Captain N in the late 80sand it was BAD, although the idea still seemed fresh. The 1990s brought us Dot Hack, which is the best the genre has to offer. When Sword Art came along, this idea was already tired and needed a fresh take on the genre to give it new life. Sword art gives us fanservice, flashy action with no plot, and tons of anime cliches that pander to the lowest common denominator. word Art was no doubt written by a team of marketers to capture the maximum demographics and make as much money as possible with no attempt to actually try and tell a good story. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot begins with 100 gamers being trapped in a massive MMORPG similar to WOW. If you die in the game then you die in real life. 2,000 people die in the first month alone! Fortunately, a number of players including our hero Kirito have played the game before and are actually good at it. The players must find out why they have been trapped in the game and find the identity of the evil game designer. Unfortunately, the plot meanders around with filler bullshit and terrible pacing. SAO doesn't have emotional or philosophical depth, so it should at LEAST be entertaining. Instead it spends most of the time being extremely boring.  After the first arc, SAO should have just ended with the shred of decency it had left. Instead it launches into an even shittier second season with sloppier writing, damsel in distress BS, and more video games. Hooray!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nOh boy, it is actually kind of difficult to review the characters because they are simply too generic and dull to even describe. The adventures of Main Character Kun and Waifu Chan! Even the villians in this series are lame. The character designs look good and fans LOVE sexy Asuna, but the personalities and character psychology is pretty awful honestly.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nHere is the only thing SAO actually does right. The visuals are actually good as one would expect for the massive budget allotted to this piece of shit. Does that make the series worth watching? No. The art is good, but not breathtaking and unique enough to carry the series by itself. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nI really wish they were all playing Dark Souls. It would last maybe 3 episodes with only Kirito getting to Blight Town and dying from plague after a massive graphics lag caused him to take a poison dart from one of many hidden snipers. That or watch Kirito's entire team get FUCKED by those god damn archers at Anor Londo. I would laugh so hard!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThe massive budget and decent art saved SAO from getting a truly terrible rating. I can't give it a 1 or 2 if I am trying to look at things objectively. It is more accurately described as extremely mediocre and insanely overrated than \"one of the worst ever\". What I hate most about SAO is how carefully it tries to capture the right demographics and go by the book to make maximum profit. I would FAR rather see a series that actually has some fucking balls and swings for the fences, even if it results in a strike out. I enjoy series like Monster, Elfen Lied, Spice and Wolf, Higurashi. Do they have flaws? Hell yes, but at least they try! SAO doesn't even swing. It is a series so cynical and calculating that it leans in and takes the bean so it can go to first base.",

            "content": "Sword Art Online was one of the most controversial titles of 2012, garnering a lot of hatred and love from either side of the census. It ended up selling like hotcakes, perhaps in part because of the bad rep it was getting from some, and there we have it. A popular franchise, now on its second season. But is it worth adoration or repulsion? My answer is a resounding \"eh, I don't really care either way\". \r\nLet's start with what the anime manages to do okay with. The music is pretty good. You cannot go wrong with Kajiura Yuki. I do wish her skills wereused for a more polished anime, though. While I didn't care much for the first opening theme, I did enjoy the second ending theme and ended up listening to it several times while watching the anime (I usually skip openings and endings). The art was quite good and certainly worthy of praise. A hefty budget gave way for fluid animation and some exciting battle scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThe main premise isn't all that bad, either. A bunch of virtual reality gamers get stuck in an MMORPG (massive multiplayer online roleplaying game, for the uninitiated) and must fight their way to \u201cclear\u201d the game. The problem is that the first episode itself is rather foggy about exactly how one \u201cclears\u201d the game, and I went on for at least half the SAO arc wondering why exactly the players weren't more driven to actually, you know, level up. I made up from several conversations that all it took was one person to beat the game, and then everyone could leave. Perhaps it's just my comprehension that is wacky, though. \\n\\n\r\nWhat Sword Art Online fails with is making us care about what is happening at all. We know absolutely nothing about any of the characters. Developments seem to happen off-screen, the episodes don't connect to each other, and characters pull plot twists out of their derri\u00e8res. What we're left with is a mess of interactions that aren't interesting or titillating in the slightest. Plot points that we should have been able to infer or guess for ourselves instead appear with little to no rhyme or reason. Revelations should leave me astounded or with a sense of satisfaction that I was right for my assumptions. Instead I was left feeling dysphoric and unimpressed with the anime's direction. Everything seemed childish. \\n\\n\r\nThere are far too many time skips to make the viewer feel connected or interested in any way. Characters and events that I should care for lack the chemistry and artistic finesse to actually make me do so. This causes the main characters (and side characters, for that matter) to come across as under-developed and flat, which they are. We have little to no reason to actually empathize with them. Their stories simply unfold in front of our eyes like a secondhand play script, minus the emotion that an actual script would contain. \\n\\n\r\nAnother problem that appears is the apparent necessity for Kirito, the main lead, to form a harem. Instead of actually interacting with his main love interest, part of the SAO arc consists of mostly stand-alone episodes wherein he saves or assists a girl of an obligatory archetype. We have the shy girl, the loli, the tsundere, among others. Most of these girls end up falling for Kirito in one way or another. What makes matters worse is that these characters usually do not join Kirito's party for long, if at all, making the episodes seem pointless as the girls often do not appear again. Combined with the fact that the majority of them aren't very memorable, it makes for a rather contrived manner of showing the main lead's many \"facets\", if one wishes to call them that. \\n\\n\r\nHis facets can be described in one word: \"perfection\". Kirito rarely does something wrong, and if he does, it's clearly other characters' fault \u2013 or no one holds him responsible, anyway. He is the poster child for what every young boy would want to be, which would be fine and dandy in children's fiction, except Sword Art Online is marketed as a thrilling and nail-bitingly exciting life-or-death escapade. Kirito always has the best equipment, always comes up on top in fights, and always knows best. The first few episodes have him displaying one of the strangest and most jarring mood switches I've ever seen, made worse so by the fact that there is not even a hint of an explanation and that the mood swing makes no further appearance in a later episodes. \\n\\n\r\nWhile Kirito's relationship with Asuna, his love interest, was refreshingly mutual and realistic, it failed to make any sort of impression on me other than \"oh, hey, they're actually together\". The majority of their developments, especially in the beginning of the series, seem rushed and jarring in comparison to the rest of the anime. Things just happen, and we don't get to see an actual emotional connection or bond between the two of them. In fact, at first, they are downright hostile to one another. Perhaps \"realistic\", in this case, is not a proper word to describe them; still, I feel it's an apt descriptor for a couple who actually behaves like a couple amidst of a sea of anime where leads rarely get together until the last few episodes. \\n\\n\r\nThat brings us to the second arc of Sword Art Online, and that is where things go horribly wrong, even for SAO standards. The lack of Asuna's presence gives Kirito an excuse to enlarge his harem \u2013 and perpetuate a \"plot twist\" that was completely unnecessary, tasteless, and downright senseless. A series of plot twists, even. And once again, these are pulled straight out of characters' behinds with no one the wiser. While the second arc does have a bit more of a coherent plot, it still fails to provide much entertainment value or intrigue. It ends up seeming like simply an attempt to provide wish fulfilment. It doesn't bring anything new to the table except more frustration and boredom, and in the end there is still almost no reason to care for any of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nJust about the only good thing about this arc is that the main villain actually seems to have a tangible purpose, unlike the antagonist of the first arc, who simply existed. The villain of SAO's second arc also managed to come off as particularly despicable and it was quite satisfying even for me to see Kirito go to town on him, so I suppose at least they got that aspect right. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the anime left me with a feeling of utter indifference and the sensation as if I'd just consumed too much junk food. And that's exactly what this anime is: junk food. It's not good for you and won't do anything for your health, but it might be entertaining for a little while.",

LiSA knows how to pump a show up.\r\n+ The animation for the most part was consistent with it's smooth flow (hair waving, action sequences, running, etc.)\r\n+ (personal) the concept may be old (Main dude plays VRMMO. Dude and everyone else is trapped in it. Beat the game to be free and stuff) but it would be my first time being used in an anime.\r\n+ The first 2 episodes made this show looked very promising............\r\nCONS/what I disliked/hated:\r\n- ....... Therest of the series (23 ep) ranges from \"meh\" to borderline \"unwatchable\"\\n\r\n- (Sp) this show would feel more cohesive if level 40+ Kirito cared a bit more about completing the SAO mission. but nah, he just dicks around the lower levels, slowly making his own harem as the episodes go by.\\n\r\n- Romance element was too \"Tween-y\" for me.\\n\r\n- (Sp) \"Mama\" \"Papa\"? WTF is this? Can i please have an A.I. w/o feelings?\\n\r\n- ALO arc loses the danger from the 1st half. At this point, the whole story is 100% emotional driven (which isn't good cause i don't like ANYONE at this point)\\n\r\n- Leafa/Sugu's whole existence is irrelevant to Kirito's ALO mission and becomes a waste of time\\n\r\n- The fanservice in here is insulting.\\n\r\n- (Sp) the last scene of the show involving Kirito's avatar makes almost no sense.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Note:\\n\r\nTrust me, this shit's overhyped. The 1st Arc's concept is cool, only to be shitted on with feelings and the 2nd Arc is............. i dont even know.\\n\\n\r\nConsider a must see? - no",

            "content": "Of all the anime I've watched this year, this one might perplex me the most. It's one of the more fundamentally flawed series I've watched this year, but at the same time, I found myself saying, \"wow, I'm actually enjoying this.\" With that said, these are the things I did like about the series...\r\nI can say for a certainty that I loved the concept behind it. I absolutely loved the concept of a game developer trapping gamers inside a virtual reality MMORPG and they have to struggle to survive in this world. In order to complete the game, they have to reach the top floorand defeat the final boss to free everyone from this world. As soon as I heard that concept, I knew I would really enjoy this. Although, I will admit, this series tested my patience at times.\\n\\n\r\nWhile it's been the topic of much debate amongst fans, I actually really liked the characters. The lead protagonist is Kazuto Kirigaya (Kirito), a 14-year-old (16 after the series jumps ahead two years) online gaming junkie who's a bit of a loner and I can say I liked his character. I wish the series would've done a little better job of hashing out his backstory, but considering that would become a minor plot point later on in the series, I bared with it. Asuna Yuuki was yet another character I really liked right off the bat. She's a bit cold toward everyone and for the most part keeps herself hidden, but you could tell she's a tough player. I really liked how they portrayed her as the series wore on during the Aincrad arc and (I'm not even sure I can consider this a spoiler anymore) thought it was nice that her relationship with Kirito went into a positive direction. My biggest complaint with Asuna is that I wish we could've seen a little more of her backstory both inside the game and out considering this series becomes very jumpy with its plot in the first 7 episodes. I liked the chemistry both her and Kirito shared, although that did change later on during the Alfheim arc. I also found the side characters to be quite endearing as well, although, many of them got very little character development due to a serious lack of screen time. I found Ryo (Klein) and Andrew (Agil) to be some very nice side characters that assisted Kirito and Asuna at times during the game, with Klein being the first person Kirito met in the game. The antagonists were done quite well and it was interesting to see how Akihiko's plot unraveled. The only thing I can say as a negative toward the antagonists was that they were rather predictable. It is one of those animes where you know EXACTLY who a villain is as soon as they appear in the series. Overall, the characters were good base characters, my one argument would be they needed to be hashed out a little better.\\n\\n\r\nI did personally like the romantic elements behind this series, but I did find myself groaning at the forced romantic tension that was brought forth in the latter half of the series. I've seen many people consider this a harem anime, and while I wouldn't call it a harem myself, A-1 certainly gave an impression that they were trying to give Kirito one. While I didn't necessarily like this move by A-1, I thought they did a nice job ironing it out in the final four episodes.\\n\\n\r\nI would mention the art and music being very good as well, but I don't there's any question that A-1 put an honest to God effort in with its budget. They even went out and got Yuki Kajira to do the music for this series, and she's one of the most infamous musical composers in the industry right now. It was nice to see LiSA come along with her for the ride after working together with Kajira on the Fate/Zero OP. They collaborated one more time with the 1st OP of this series and it ended up being one of my favorite anime OPs of the year. I found Crossing Field is an addictive song and I have to give A-1 credit, they made an OP that made me WANT to stay for the full ride. Overall, I will admit that this isn't Kajira's best work, but I will say that her average work is still better than a lot of composers' best. I found the music enjoyable, not her best work, but still enjoyable nonetheless and still fit the mood of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nI said a lot of positive things about SAO, but unfortunately, this anime was far from perfect. The biggest flaw I found with the series was it felt too rushed. Considering this series was adapted from the light novel series by Reki Kawahara, I felt A-1 should've just focused on adapting the first two volumes instead of trying to squeeze the first four into this 25 episode set. With as many characters as they have in this series, I felt they could've done a better job of hashing them out if they only covered the Aincrad arc with the 25 episode set. Considering this anime is told from Kirito's POV, they could've done a better job of developing the chemistry he has with the supporting characters. I can say one thing for certain, if this series ended on the 25th episode like it ended in the 14th episode, I would be begging A-1 for a sequel and highly anticipating it. The 14th episode felt much more like a season finale than the 25 episode did, although, I can't really criticize the execution of the 25th ep. It was a \"nice\" conclusion to the series, but certainly not \"epic.\" Then again, it seemed as though the 25th episode was half-conclusion, half-exposition. For spoiler reasons, I won't reveal why there's so much exposition in the final episode. I can say it wasn't unnecessary exposition, but it was a little tedious and does take away from the overall effect of the final episode. As I've already said, A-1 really should've split these up into two different 24-25 episode seasons. The concepts and content involved in the Sword Art Online plot is far too vast to fit two different arcs into a 25 episode series.\\n\\n\r\nYet another thing that bugged me and this should come as no surprise, I really didn't like how the ALO arc was handled. Of course, this point does go back a bit to my point of trying to fit two different arcs into a 25 episode season, but the ALO arc only had 11 episodes to work with...and even then, not all 11 of those episodes consisted of ALO material. On top of that, there was a STARK decline in the likability of the characters in the ALO arc. I didn't find any of the characters outside of the ones coming over from the SAO arc to be very likable or memorable outside of Sugou, who made for an excellent villain character. Even besides the point, I really couldn't understand what A-1 was doing with some of the \"imagery.\" What I mean by \"imagery\" is that they really tuned up the \"ecchi\" and in this series, I really didn't like that. Most of it was completely unnecessary. Not only is it unnecessary ecchi, some of it is downright off-putting and while I'm trying to avoid spoilers, if you've never seen this anime before, there is a scene in episode 21 that will make you say \"WTF?\" It was a scene that caught me completely off-guard and it even made me hate the producers for putting such a scene in. While I'm not someone that necessarily hates ecchi, I just found it to be unnecessary for this series. While I cannot say for certain since I haven't read all of the light novel, I found the direction of ALO to be a bit odd. The SAO arc's focus was specifically with Kirito's character and built a lot around his interactions. ALO on the other hand seemed to go slightly more 3rd person, not only going off Kirito's POV, but Suguha's and Asuna's as well. It was a stark and noticeable change...and for the series' sake, I don't think it was the best move. I understood why they went that route with the ALO arc, but with this series setup in two halves, it's just very bizarre to switch a story's POV from 1st person to 3rd person right in the middle of the series. Again, yet another reason why these two arcs should've been completely different series runs.\\n\\n\r\nThe best way I can describe Sword Art Online? It's a good series. If we're going by MAL forum discussion, the series isn't as good or as bad as some make it out to be (not sure how many of you read the MAL forums, but I don't think I've ever seen such parity about the quality of a series before), but in my honest opinion, it's a pretty decent series. It was probably one of the better ones of 2012 that I watched, but then again, I have a very low opinion about the quality of anime in 2012. The writing isn't necessarily great and it does leave the impression that there was a lot more that they could've done with the series, but even despite that, it was a fun series to watch. While there were quite a few flaws that were quite off-putting at times, it was still a fun ride from start to finish and for the gamer in anyone, it's an anime I'd recommend, especially if you do enjoy a romance to go with it.",

            "content": "Sword Art Online, one of the most controversial anime ever. Where to begin? For starters, I think Sword Art Online is extremely good. The first half was meaningful. Most of everyone's gripe is the serious tone of trapped in a death game was decreased by romance. But I think the image is too confused with Attack on Titan which was entirely on survival. Sword Art Online is really a MMO cover, but more a romance and action series. \r\nThat said, here is where everyone is divided. Those who think Kirito is really cool and the people that think cause he's so cool, he has nodevelopment. Both are true actually, so we're forever gonna have two sets of opinions. I'm no rookie gamer, I know it takes a lot of effort to get through a game. That said, I don't agree when people say Kirito is overpowered and always wins easily. I mean he did start off stronger than others cause he was a beta tester, but that don't make him God either, outside the plot holes. Kirito shows strength to conquer and overcome obstacles represented by the flashy attacks everyone thinks is just for show off. And so we have the legendary fights with the legendary OST by Yuki Kajiura. And I do recall that he lost before. \\n\\n\r\nNow onto Asuna, she was depicted as a badass at the start and suddenly turned romance with Kirito. Well it's not so sudden, let me explain the transformation. Remember Asuna is still a girl and girls like good looking guys with a good heart. The critical moment that happened which Kirito did to officially capture Asuna's heart was fighting for her hand so she could leave the guild. It's like Kirito gave Asuna her proposal of love. It was the knight's promise that I WOULD PROTECT YOU! That would move even me! And after some solo time together, a beautiful love life develops, lovers inseparable.\\n\\n\r\nThe side stories in the first arc, many people consider to be unnecessary. But without the side stories, we would never get the chance to explore the world of Sword Art Online. And it gives Kirito the chance to meet other players and befriend them. There is a big misconception here. No after awhile they are not forgotten, they just don't meet. I have played MMOs before and the only time you would constantly be with another player is if you are playing in parties. Otherwise, it is good game, we'll meet again. \\n\\n\r\nAlright now to the second half, this arc is harder to explain it's good cause the negative feelings come from the fact that it has lost the original premise of trapped in a death game. Rather, we are replaced with a save the damsel in distress story in a sillier elf setting. I would agree the first half was more exciting, but let's not eliminate the second half just yet. The story may have drastically changed, but our characters are still our characters. This arc is the TEST OF WILLPOWER! How strong our love and bonds hold despite torn apart. And with a mentally retarded horndog villain Sugou on our heads.\\n\\n\r\nThis is going to be really hard for some of you, but you're just going to have to accept the fact there's incest. I mean, if it happens it can't be helped right? I think Kirito handled it pretty well. He got another respect point from me. And the fanservice really doubled compared to the first half. Is that a bad thing? Maybe and maybe not. Maybe because it can be viewed as insulting to particularly Asuna, and maybe not because it fits Sugou's role and personally I thought the fanservice was hot as fuck. Don't worry readers, Kirito will once again venture out in this new world to rescue Asuna, just like how he's always been there for her.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I have really enjoyed Sword Art Online and hope you do too. There are various opinions out there, but I advise you to watch and form your own. Please give my review a fair evaluation. I'm counting on you.\\n",

            "content": "Sword Art Online, otherwise known as SAO, has become the subject of much criticism and praise this summer. Starting as a popular light novel written by Reki Kawahara and later being adapted into three manga, a game, and an anime- SAO has become immensely popular. After seeing several reviews for this anime, I decided to give it a try. Who hasn't wanted to escape from reality every once in a while? Why most of read books/play video games/watch anime is because we want to \"escape to another world.\" However cliche the idea, Reki Kawahara handled it nicely. With interesting characters and the idea of actuallife or death hanging in the balance, SAO is not your average cliche. A lot of times when futuristic or technological anime pop up, you're going to find a lot of loopholes. Hell, even more than loopholes, the story just won't make sense. You'll think the story was written by someone with no technological knowledge at all. It makes me wonder, \"Why are you even in this genre?\" Thankfully, that's not the case here. The idea of nerve gear and the whole beta-tester idea was very well thought out. I was constantly thinking I found a flaw in the story when they would point out, for instance, \"Oh, the nerve gear has a built in battery pack, so you can't just unplug it.\"\\n\\n\r\nSAO is an entertaining anime that I look forward to every week. Sure, it's no masterpiece (yet), but a large variety of people are going to find that SAO is worth my praise. Having only seen 5 episodes so far, I can't yet give you a 100% accurate review. From the 5 episodes I've seen: The art's great. The sound is nice. The characters are interesting, and it's very enjoyable. So far  the story seems a little bit rushed, almost leaving you in a daze, but I think he could do amazing things with SAO in the future.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a nice, fun anime, SAO will most likely satisfy your needs. Even if you're not looking for a nice, fun anime, SAO also has it's deep moments. Because of this fun story filled with deep moments, SAO will appeal to a large variety of audiences. Whether your a comedy, romance, action or thriller lover, Sword Art Online is an anime that nearly everyone can enjoy.",

And yeah i liked it, but it wasn't perfect, it has so many flaws that i'll explain later, otherwise it was a good anime series, i think you guys will enjoy it (And i really don't get why there are so many haters, I mean this was a good one, it doesn't deserve so much hate LOL....)\r\nAnyway i'll start with my review now (And please understand that this is my very first review so it might not be very good... D:) (there will beMINOR SPOILERS if you keep reading, be aware of that)\\n\\n\r\nStory 7 - The idea is so original, well i've heard that the anime/game Hack had a similar plot, but still i found it a refreshing and new idea, and as i cleared before i'm also a videogame lover so i found it even more interesting, who wouldn't wish for a virtual reality game, i'd LOVE to get one, for real... \\n\r\nEven though i liked the idea the way it was portrayed wasn't that good, it had so many flaws as i commented before. Specially after the SAO arc, i didn't really like LAO as much as the previous arc, what i disliked the most about it is how they brought out this new arc, that sudden ending (ep 15) how they made SAO disappear, it was TOO sudden. I was enjoying so much how they were going through all the floors beating all those powerful final bosses, but that ep 15 was so rushed. I'd have enjoyed the show so much more if the SAO arc were longer... The arc was nice i liked the fights and the relationship that Asuna and Kirito had (I agree that their relationship developed a bit fast, but i still enjoyed it), even though the first 4 eps were a bit confusing, you don't really know where the show is going. Now i found LAO a bit hummm not disappointing, but yeah i found it less interesting than the SAO arc, specially at the beginning of the arc, the last 4 episodes were really good, they kept me hooked up till the end of the series, the fights were pretty well portrayed. I ended up enjoying this arc as well.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9 - It's one of the strong points of this anime, the animation is so good, i love how the fights were portrayed, and the characters are so well drawn.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8 - The soundtracks of this anime are pretty good, i enjoyed all the OPs and EDs plus the background music as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8 - I liked most of them, specially the main leads of this series Asuna and Kirito, i liked the fact that they both are strong, not the typical strong - weak pairing, if you guys get what i mean... the rest of the characters were ok... I didn't really get attached with them but Yui... i really liked her. One of the things that i didn't like of this series is the \"harem\" thing. I know that the one that Kirito loves stays the same, but it's a fact that almost all the girls that appear in the series fall in love with him. (I don't like this because i'm not a harem lover)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9 - I enjoyed this anime, it kept me hooked up till the end, there were better episodes and worse ones but it's definitely worth to watch. Of course it's only my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 8 - I pointed out good points and bad about this anime but i liked it in general and it kept me hooked up till the last episode.\\n\r\nIt's true that there are better animes out there, but i would recommend you guys to watch it, give it a shot specially if you're videogames lover just like me you will enjoy it.",

            "content": "To state my opinion bluntly, Sword Art Online is a mediocre anime at best.  It's a pretty looking anime, but a bad one none the less.  Now I know some of you fans of the series are already prepared to tear me apart, but hear me out.  This review will be split into four parts: story, art, sound, and characters.  I hope you find my review helpful!\r\nStory: This anime is popular enough so that I don't have to do an in depth summary about the plot for you.  If you're reading this review, chances are you already know what it'sabout.  But, for those of you who don't know, this anime is about a VR MMO RPG that ends up trapping people in its virtual world and if you die in the game, you die in real life.  Thus the main character, Kirito, along with most of the other players, try to beat the game so they can log out and survive the whole ordeal.  Now, despite what I said in the opening, I don't actually have a huge problem with the plot.  Hell, as a gamer myself, I thought it was a pretty neat.  Yes while the latter half of the anime's story leaves some to be desired, I thought it was okay overall.  It was nothing special, but it was enough to get me interested in the series.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: The aesthetics is where this anime really shines through.  The visuals for SAO were nothing short of gorgeous.  All the characters and monsters looked spectacular.  The backgrounds were beautiful, being both captivating and interesting.  Seriously, hats off to the artists on this one.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: SAO's soundtrack was pretty good, but forgettable.  There weren't any songs in particular that really stood out to me.  Unfortunately, I'm not too well versed in what makes good music good, so take this part with a grain of salt.  But, overall, nothing truly stuck with me.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Now, you're all probably wondering what the hell happened to that little rant at that beginning?  Up until now, I have done nothing but say positive (fairly positive at least) things about this series.  So, where did it go wrong?  Why do I view this anime with such disdain?  It's the characters.  One character in particular, Kirito.  This single character, along with a few others, ruined what could have been one of my top animes.  Now, having your entire opinion ride on a single character may seem petty, but if a series' main protagonist is just unbearably awful and boring, how am I supposed to enjoy the series?  Let me explain my problems with Kirito in the best way I can:\\n\r\n-He is FAR too overpowered.  I mean WAY WAY too overpowered.  While I realize being one of the best players in the game is part of his character, I can't help but feel annoyed when Kirito beats every challenge thrown at him without even breaking a sweat.  This robs most fight scenes of any sort of suspense or excitement.  It's my belief that a good character needs to struggle for victory, to experience failure and then improve himself to overcome it.  But Kirito simply beats most everything the first go around, without even trying.  Whenever he does seem like he (gasp) might actually lose the upperhand, he pulls some ridiculous shit out of his ass like dual wielding.  Maybe that could have been justified if the anime didn't use so many time skips and we could have seen him training and developing the skill.  But the simple matter is that moments like this feel like a cheap cop out to rob any suspense from a fight scene.\\n\\n\r\n-His personality is SO SO boring.  Kirito is your average nice guy/badass/loner/brave/has a troubled past/insert another cliche.  I could forgive his OPness if he had an intriguing personality that I could get behind, but the simple fact is that he doesn't.  He is too perfect and, because of that, he is extremely flawed.  There doesn't seem to be a single thing wrong with the guy, which I find to be a huge issue.  Because of this, he just seems like some power trip fantasy, which makes the writing come across as silly and immature.\\n\\n\r\n-Kirito hogs the limelight.  I know he is the main character, but side characters exist for a reason.  Almost all of the side characters are completely incompetent.  Even Asuna, who is introduced as a badass and independent female lead, is quickly shoved into damsel in distress mode so Kirito can fulfill his male power trip destiny.  I would have liked to see some characters other than Kirito have more badass moments, like the guy in the red samurai armor that he meets at the beginning (sorry, his name escapes me).  But, no, all characters must be completely incapable compared to our lord and savior, Kirito (sorry for the sarcasm, I know it's not very mature but this character bothers me this much.)\\n\\n\r\nTo sum up my issues with Kirito, he's a gary stu, and a pretty bad one at that.  He was the main reason I could draw almost no enjoyment out of the series.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, my opinion of Sword Art Online can be summed up in two words: wasted potential.  The art was there, the story was there, the sound was there, but if I can't invest myself in the characters then I just can't enjoy it.  I might not be so annoyed with SAO if it didn't have such incredible hype behind it.  While it isn't complete garbage, it isn't even close to a masterpiece.  A masterpiece anime has to deliver everything well, story, art, music, and CHARACTERS.  When one is done poorly, it drags the entire show down.  I hope future writers will see this as a lesson in the importance of characters and will try and avoid something like this happening again (though probably not since the series made absolute bank).",

I admit when I was like 12 years old I loved this in the bottom of my heart then I realized how bad this anime was when I started watching more and more anime. This anime overall is pretty bad and I hate how people think Kirito is the best character ever and some even think that he can beat Goku... If they didn't add the part where Asuna is a mistress in distress I would've gave this a high rating but the characters in my opinion are all bad since theyall end up in Kirito's useless harem.",

It isn't great because it has a great plot or really deep characters, but just because it's very enjoyable and fun to watch.\r\nstory: 7/10\r\nThere's nothing special about the storyline, they just got stuck into a game and have to beat it. The only question you ask yourself is: why does the game creator do this.\r\nIn the second half ( wich is worse than the fist half), you ask yourself the question: Where is she?\r\nYou'll understand when you watch SAO.\r\nArt: 10/10\r\nIf there's one thingthat makes SAO a good anime, it's the art. The game world looks so beautiful that you want to be there all te time you see it and the characters really look awesome. The art really makes this anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nThe opening of SAO is very nostalgic and you enjoy it every time you hear it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6/10\\n\r\nThe thing that's really bad about SAO is the character developement and the characters' story. The only to characters that you know something about are Kirito and Asuna. Also ( spoiler ), Kirito suddenly becomes very strong without seeing that he trains or something like that. In a way it's kinda cool, you think: wow! Kirito's strong. But I think it would've been better if you could see him training.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nWhen I watched SAO, it immediately got me interrested. The fight scene's were so beautifully animated and the game world was so beautiful.\\n\r\nAlso it's just exciting and when an episode ended, you just had to see the next one.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8,2/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed SAO a lot, it's definitely not the best anime I've seen but it sure was worth watching. I definitely recommend SAO, you'll not regret it. If the second half was as good as the first half and if the character development was better, I would've scored it over a 9.",

            "content": "This review may not be as accurate as the others because I've decided to stop watching after the 10th episode. Also take in mind that being a avid gamer, I have some biases towards SAO (Sword Art Online) that are going to show up in my review. So now that I got my disclaimer out, lets start bashing this anime. \r\nLet's just say that I was hyped for SAO, it was about video games, a wicked twist, and every enjoyable aspect of a good MMORPG. Now where it falls (and it falls straight into hell, through every level of hell, and into the void) isthrough the development of the plot and characters. \\n\\n\r\nAs a serious Sci-Fi anime, it needs to have realism to immerse the viewers in watching. Every plot hole in a serious Sci-Fi anime, detracts from the anime itself. After watching SAO, I would say it has enough plot holes to satisfy every horny teenager in the world and more; except for the fact that these holes are big enough to suck in our entire universe. The anime doesn't make sense scientifically, nor do the characters react in a way that normal people or gamers would. \\n\\n\r\n FOR EXAMPLE SPOILER(many people don't die of natural causes: lack of water, food, muscular dystrophy etcetc, and even if they got to a hospital, can they really hospitalize that many people within 2 days(water) and for that long?)\\n\\n\r\nNow the reason why I've decided to stop watching this anime is the amount of cheesiness in SAO. I like a small amount of cheese in my anime just like how I like cheese in my pasta. But, the amount of cheese in the anime is like walking into my favorite most legitimate Italian restaurant: Olive Garden, then having the waiter/waitress continuously grate cheese onto my pasta until the entire restaurant is filled with their highly exclusive aged Parmesan. The love interest is cheese, the lines they say is cheese, the fight scenes are cheese, the cry scenes are cheese, the friends are cheese, the traps are cheese. Pretty much everything is so obvious and overused in SAO that it is impossible to say that SAO is original and keeps you on your toes. There are way too many times that the main character's health goes to tip minimal that it becomes a common non-thrilling occurrence.  \\n\\n\r\nFOR EXAMPLE SPOILER( The female was crying over Kirito being all  \"boo-hoo you passed out for a few seconds I thought you died...\" Please plebeian, we both know that if someone dies they shatter into a gazillion dust bunnies and also we both know you can see his bloody health bar indicating he is clearly still alive(even though this anime shouldn't be)).\\n\\n\r\nSO IN THE END, EVEN IF YOU DIDN'T DECIDE TO READ THIS FAR OR SKIPPED TO THE END: IT HAD POTENTIAL, DROPPED THE BALL, COVERED THE PLAYGROUND IN GOOEY CHEESE, THEN I WALKED AWAY. IF YOU ARE GOING TO WATCH THIS, BEING A FAMILY SIZED BAG OF CHIPS AND AN EMPTY BAG OF EXPECTATIONS. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Critic\u2019s Log - Earthdate: April 21, 2014. Review #83: Sword Art Online.\r\nBesides the fact that I enjoy watching anime. I also really enjoy playing video games such as Old-school Retro Games, The Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy, and any fun game in general . I particularly like Role-Playing Games because of a higher chance of an appealing story which RPG\u2019s does put heavy emphasis on as well as being character-driven. When I went to my local anime convention Sakura-con last year, there was this one anime that really got a hell of a lot of attention. I didn\u2019t understand why, I mean after all\u2026 Thisanime really didn\u2019t look appealing to me despite that I myself play video games to keep myself occupied on my own leisure. I think video games are pretty fun and I like playing video games with friends as well as by myself, but it all depends on the game. This \u201cgame\u201d, this anime really became an endurance test. That being\u2026 The Legend of Asuna\u2026 uh, I mean Sword Art Online.\\n\\n\r\nAcross the world, there are players that join the virtual reality Massive Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game, Sword Art Online, and they end up being trapped and fighting for their very lives. After the game master announced that the only way to leave the game is by beating it, Kirito (a very powerful swordsman) and his friends take on a quest to free all the minds trapped in Aincrad.\\n\\n\r\nChances are, my brief synopsis of Sword Art Online is a bit redundant because I have a hunch you have heard of the premise for Sword Art Online. In fact, a premise like this has been done before but Sword Art Online\u2019s premise is actually interesting. Too bad that it didn\u2019t last well for me. Sword Art Online is an A-1 Pictures production and I can\u2019t say I have been disappointed with this studio for the most part. I actually liked the animation quality to Black Butler (Kuroshitsuji), however, not everything they touch is perfect. I am in the middle of watching Fairy Tail which is another anime series by A-1 Pictures and it does look nice but the animation direction did disappoint me. Sword Art Online on the other hand is not bad for the most part but there are some areas that could have looked better. The backgrounds and all the effects work well. the problem with Sword Art Online\u2019s animation to me is its character designs. I kind of found them a little messy at times especially when they make certain moments in action scenes look fluid. If there is one thing about the animation that does not impress is how the monsters are designed. The detail on the monsters do look pretty sloppy. Even though these are only nitpicks, the animation does work when it needs to.\\n\\n\r\nThe Japanese cast is mostly alright for the most part, Yoshitsugu Matsuoka is not a bad choice for Kirito and I do give props that he does pretty well for an average seiyu, and I could say the same for Haruka Tomatsu as Asuna. The casting is pretty average except for Koichi Yamadera as Kayaba, and Toru Ohkawa as Heathcliff. They somehow do pretty well in this show. The English Dub cast does not contain average voice actors in this show. Bryce Papenbrook has been voice acting for quite a while but he doesn\u2019t really get too many big roles. Kirito is one of those few shows where he plays the main role. The performance isn\u2019t perfect but he mostly gets it right. As English Dub voice acting goes, he sounds a little like Yuri Lowenthal kind of like how Micah Solusod sounds a little like Johnny Yong Bosch. Cherami Leigh is not too bad as Asuna and she does pretty well in the show. Kirk Thornton is also a nice casting choice, too bad his character is severely sidelined. I will give Stephanie Sheh credit that she is a talented voice actress but her role as Yui didn\u2019t click with me. The dub actually has a few surprises. One! Marc Diraison as Kayaba, Marc Diraison was known for being the English voice of Guts from Berserk, but I consider the performance take it or leave it. Two! Vic Mignogna has a minor role where it involves \u201cTentacles\u201d Be worried Vic Mignogna fangirls, be very afraid. Three! Todd Haberkorn\u2019s villainous and eerie performance in the second half. Kudos to Todd Haberkorn! The Japanese cast is mostly average and does alright for the most part. the Dub has some nice choices but I did not expect too much from the dub and it holds up alright.\\n\\n\r\nThe music by Yuki Kaijura however does deserve a special mention. The soundtrack suits the show very well but it really isn\u2019t a memorable soundtrack outside the show, but with inside the show. the soundtrack does its job for the most part. Kaijura-san was an interesting composer choice considering she is known for the soundtrack of a similar anime that you probably know which is .Hack//SIGN. It may feel like it was a predictable choice but the soundtrack wasn\u2019t that bad. The first opening \u201cCrossing Field\u201d by LiSA is a pretty memorable catchy theme. I will give the show\u2019s credit that the first opening theme stands out. I could say the same with the first closing theme \u201cYume Sekai\u201d / \u201cDream World\u201d by Haruka Tomatsu. The second opening theme \u201cInnonence\u201d by Eir Aoi  is an ok opening, nothing more\u2026 I could say say the same for the second closing theme \u201cOverfly\u201d by Luna Haruna. The music is mostly pretty good and it does not disappoint.\\n\\n\r\nIf there is one major flaw with Sword Art Online, it is the characters. Kirito really is a wish-fulfillment character and not for reasons that impressed me. The guy is a fucking chick magnet in the show and this aspect of him distracted me. To make the issue far more stressful. It doesn\u2019t really add anything to the story whatsoever. What I really don\u2019t like about Kirito is how he seems to be average at first, acts like a smartass in the next, and then acts depressed because he\u2019s alone when he prefers to do things solo in a MMORPG where playing the role of Leeroy Jenkins does not fucking compute whatsoever. His personality is a mixed bag to me and this character just didn\u2019t do it for me that much. However, he gets the most screentime out of everybody in the show, so I guess Kirito is the only character that has likely chances of someone relating to\u2026 but that\u2019s where the show\u2019s problems really lie. There are a good number of characters that have potential to stick out in the show and Yui is actually the only one besides Kirito that actually sticks around in the long run since she first appears. However characters like Klien, Agil get sidelined quite heavily in this show and this is a pretty obvious sign that this show disappoints with its portrayal of characters. There are other new characters that show up later in this anime but they suffer the same problem. Out of all the characters, Asuna is the main female lead in this show and you would think that she plays a huge role in the show. Here\u2019s the thing, She does play a big role in the series except that she starts out great until the show progresses and she is reduced to the stereotypical female character with housewife traits. If you thought that was disappointing\u2026 it gets worse. FAR WORSE. The biggest issue with Asuna is that during the second half. Well\u2026 Let\u2019s just say her role gets drastically reduced till the last quarter of the 25 episodes of this anime. Asuna had potential, but sadly\u2026 Her character was under disappointing results. What\u2019s even more insulting is that there was a romance established in the first half but it was built up even more in the second half where it felt really forced shoddy. About that second half, Kirito\u2019s \u201csister\u201d plays a huge role where she hardly played a role in the first half and yet she does the things Asuna could have done in the show and gets even more screentime than Asuna in the second half. To make this long story short. The characterization, and character development is fucking awful in this show. .\\n\\n\r\nThis leads to what I think most people can agree is the most questionable factor of Sword Art Online, which is\u2026 The story. In all honesty, the premise is actually interesting and this anime had great potential with it. The first 3 episodes were not too bad, but that was until a few more episodes came in and the show\u2019s focus seemed to not work anymore. The show\u2019s first half really does take time to sit through but what cheapened the story is the timeskips that take place in this show. It did not help the character development as properly as it could have. Kirito\u2019s character development is half-assed at times and he\u2019s \u201cThe Black Swordsman\u201d?. Guts from Berserk had some good character development and he\u2019s the real deal when it comes to the title of \u201cThe Black Swordsman\u201d and he earned the damn title too. the second quarter of the show is ok, but once the first half is over, that\u2019s when the story takes a nosedive towards an inane direction. The first half is supposedly called the \u201cAincrad Arc\u201d, which is set in the virtual reality world called \u201cSword Art Online\u201d, right? Here\u2019s where the second half comes in\u2026 It\u2019s called the \u201cFairy Dance Arc\u201d set in ALFheim Online where everyone appears as a Fairy\u2026 Not being set in Sword Art Online. Here\u2019s the problem. THE SECOND ARC OF SWORD ART ONLINE DOES NOT STAY TRUE TO THE SHOW\u2019S TITLE. That\u2019s right, half the show is in Sword Art Online, the latter half should have renamed the show \u201cSword Art Online: Alfheim Online\u201d, but it doesn\u2019t. This can be viewed as misleading. Here\u2019s the show\u2019s biggest problem. Whatever the first arc was building up to becomes irrelevant later on except for Kirito\u2019s motives which I will not explain for spoiler reasons. The reason I am stressing some potential spoilers is because you may want to know a few things before jumping into this game. To make matters worse, the second arc is paced a lot more faster than the first arc but the second arc feels rather pointless in buildup which leads to a conclusion that surprisingly doesn\u2019t end in a shitty way for the most part. The character factor really suffers because of half-assed writing and unfocused direction by Tomohiko Ito. What I like to know is why fans think this schlock is the same in the source material which are the light novels series of the same name by Reki Kawahara. I can\u2019t state my opinion on those because I haven\u2019t read them.\\n\\n\r\nThis leads to my concluding topic surrounding this anime. Sword Art Online is ridiculously overhyped and I don\u2019t understand how people thought Sword Art Online was a great anime. If the show only had the first arc alone, it would be fine yet it would still have bad characterization. The second arc could\u2019ve gave the show an extra subtitle, but whatever\u2026 it still doesn\u2019t add much to the show but it makes the experience far more inane yet more watchable than the first arc just to see how stupid it can get. But here\u2019s the thing. There are more arcs after the first two which are yet to be adapted in Sword Art Online\u2019s second season. The next arcs involve Guns and the Underworld according to their titles in the light novel series. Which makes the title \u201cSword Art Online\u201d a little more questionable now that \u201cGuns\u201d are thrown in during the third arc. Having different settings with each arc wouldn\u2019t be a bad thing if the title were different and a little more creative. If there is something that\u2019s not even an anime, and not a TV show or movie at that, there is a very well known video game franchise that\u2019s sort of similar in not keeping the same formula from game to game, and that is The Legend of Zelda, what makes the series work to me and possible other gamers is that the games are different from game to game for most of the time. Ocarina of Time was treated as a coming of age game but with an epic atmosphere in it. Majora\u2019s Mask took place in a parallel world with Death as a motif in the game. The Wind Waker\u2019s landscape was mostly water, Twilight Princess involved two realms, so on and so on. What makes those games work is that if you ignore the timeline, the games are treated as legends and it maintains the expanding mythos that made that franchise beloved for years. Sword Art Online kind of has standalone settings from arc to arc, but since the first two arcs had two volumes each in the light novels 25 episodes in the anime adaptation, it didn\u2019t really leave room for me to be captivated in the worlds that Sword Art Online shows where in the Zelda games, you can play them for hours and the player can explore in any given time. Because I am comparing Sword Art Online to a video game franchise (and a beloved one at that). I am only drawing the comparisons because of how Sword Art Online plays out. It may be a silly comparison to say the least but I felt the Zelda series was a good example because it doesn\u2019t stick with one main concept for 1 game. Sword Art Online doesn\u2019t stay the same after one arc as well.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the bigger question is\u2026Is it really that bad? In my opinion, My answer is Yes and No. I would say yes because of its poor characterization and half-assed writing. I would say no because the soundtrack isn\u2019t too bad despite it not being a standout feature in the show, but the animation is what makes the show somehow watchable. The action scenes are the show\u2019s saving decency in this entire package. I will give the show credit that the action scenes are watchable and can make the show recommendable just for the action. I was not expecting Sword Art Online to be a Masterpiece but I was a little surprised that the action wasn\u2019t that bad to begin with. If this anime made you react with Angry Nerd- like emotions. I don\u2019t blame you and I\u2019m dead fucking serious about that. If you actually were able to sit through the entire show, then YOU\u2019RE WINNER! But I can tell you one thing, The Legend of Asuna and Asuna II: The Adventure of the Black Swordsman left a impact that I would like to call \u201cCluster Fuck Online\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nSword Art Online is available from Aniplex of America, the light novel series by Reki Kawahara and illustrated by abec is available by Yen Press. Six manga adaptations of Sword Art Online written by Reki Kawahara and illustrated by Tamako Nakamura have not been released in the U.S. Sword Art Online: Progressive, another light novel series of S.A.O. has also not been released stateside. The Sword Art Online video game \u201cInfinity Moment\u201d has not been released outside of Japan and I don\u2019t expect it to\\n\\n\r\nWith all that said, Sword Art Online is an RPG-inspired anime that had potential because of its premise. It sadly disappoints with its sloppy writing, poor characterization and character development, its soundtrack is not too bad and the action makes it the only watchable thing for this anime. This anime may have had a big deal of hype in a ridiculous level in the past but it is no wonder why this series was controversial in its enjoyment factor. Half of it is decent, Half of it can be viewed as a virtual clusterfuck.\\n\\n\r\nI give Sword Art Online a 4.8 out of 10, it is NOT REALLY GOOD!\\n\\n\r\nFeel free to leave a comment after I log out of Sword Art Online\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nNext Time: The World!",

Just WTH ?!\r\nArt & Sound: 8/10  At least, the chara-design and the soundtrack were good.\r\nCharacters : 5/10 Well, during the 1st arc, I'dgive a 9/10, but the 2nd.. Kirito.. Crying all the the time.. just no.. And the SM hair fetishist guy.. *facepalm*\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 5/10 Like for the characters, I enjoyed the 1st arc, but the 2nd, I just forced myself to watch the end of this anime..\\n\\n\r\nOverall : The 1st arc was perfect and it probably be better if it was the only arc..\\n\r\nThe 2nd arc is just a waist..\\n\r\nWithout the 2nd arc, I'd probably give a 8-9/10",

I had no idea sao was ranked at 273 as of now. That is an astronomically high figure for the actual quality of the show. Sao is worth at most 1000-1500. The only redeeming quality of this anime is the art. Also the fact that all perverted male teens are attracted to heterosexually cliched romance. Anyway, in short, The characters are grossly written; especially the female characters. Actually really though. No female character is written to any higherdegree than \"Wow, this unattractive simpleton is for whatever unholy reason kinda hot and I think I'm in love!\" The story is also unoriginal and bland. \\n\\n\r\nI will now summarize this review with a series of adjectives that describe sao:\\n\\n\r\nCliched\\n\r\nSad (no actually it makes me sad thinking i spent time watching this)\\n\r\nUnoriginal\\n\r\nBoring\\n\r\nInferior\\n\r\nPainful\\n\r\nAverage\\n\r\nTrite\\n\r\nAtrocious\\n\r\nCute (the art and shitty romance)\\n\r\nHeterosexual\\n\r\nPathetic\\n\r\nBAD\\n\\n\r\nThank you.

            "content": "As a kid I remember picking up a lot of different games for systems. The first console I ever touched was a SNES and the first operating system I used was Windows 3.0. The first Action RPG game I ever played was in 1996 and a product of Blizzard North and Activision, you may know this game as Diablo. To this day Diablo is still one of my favorite games to play.\r\nSword Art Online to me was a mixed bag of emotions because it employed a melting pot of a number of negatives and positives. I've always been a huge fan of anything remotely consideredRPG and I couldn't help but picking this up. I can't say I'm a real die hard fan of this because some of the elements pissed me off.\\n\\n\r\nI really had some good expectations leading into this just reading a basic summary and the story was definitely something I could enjoy on a weekly basis. I liked the idea of what you would call a permanent hardcore mode, really just a casual gamers way of describing the nature of the game being life threatening or as someone from the ghetto might call it \"YOLO\". The first episode definitely hooked you in and kept you coming back for more per usual ending episode cliffhangers. I liked how the story progressed into what you would typically see in a RPG: level up, meet some friends, and making a name for yourself. Kirito seemed to really become the typical hero you would expect him to be and properly utilize his knowledge of the game. Although my expectations were not fully met I can say this was a decent half and hour spent per week.\\n\\n\r\nThats not to say I didn't like the entire plot, the different arcs is where I started to branch of different feelings. I enjoyed the SAO arc but when the ALO arc came around I found myself not liking the content being presented. The story seemed to be sluggish and slow progressing compared the the SAO arc and there was more conversation time and drama build up over a love triangle. The lack of fights and all out battles in the ALO arc really left a sour taste in my mouth. They still managed to keep the \"Game of Death\" theme because Kirito was really fighting for more than his life for the majority of the story. I felt the writers could have split this into two different seasons rather than combine them, the SAO ending was appropriate but they seemed to lose focus after it. I'd rather not even say anything about the rushed ending. The writers focusing a majority of the central plot around a Kirito and Asuna relationship is what made the chains move for pretty much all 25 episodes. But one of the one things that pissed me off most was the cheap tactic of overused cliffhangers. It seemed that at the end of almost every episode the writers used a cliffhanger to draw you back in, this gives birth to the reference \"Enjoy your crappy show\".\\n\\n\r\nAs a gamer; visuals and end game content are probably what is most important to me, my recent bitter taste of hate came after the release of Diablo III, guess why? No end game content just excellent visuals. That's not to say Sword Art Online didn't have above average visuals. The environments of these VRMMO's were animated very well, I liked how Takeda Yusuke and his team put effort into blaring battle visuals and scenery that could match real world environments. There were a number of different environments that you would typically see in a MMO that made it feel realistic and not cheesy. The characters were all crafted as not to seem completely un-realistic despite what would have happened if the writers allowed them to keep their SAO alter egos rather than doing what they did and revert the players to their real world images.\\n\\n\r\nThe one point I have to overlook however is some character designs and inconsistencies. Some of the visuals tried to force a gross amount of fanservice which can really derail any series due to its nature to disgust people. Panty flashes and breast hops aren't really something fit for a series like this, it makes it turn a slightly different direction of hack and slash. The character known as Suguha seemed to have implants through the second part of the series and the animators and writers tried to make the character more appealing. The level of inconsistency had me shaking my head because it frustrates some people to change a characters design mid way.\\n\\n\r\nSome of the characters seemed like they were just put there for cameos and the writers focused too much on the main characters rather than incorporate everyone in the story. I can't really say much about them, I never had a particular favorite character.\\n\\n\r\nStill, a game isn't a game if you have just visuals and amazing content. You need sound effects to put you in the mood. Iwanami Yoshikazu put some feel into the battle scenes with intense choir vocals that gave battles more edge and combined with the animation the battles were probably all I looked forward to. I never really favored any of the ending or opening themes, I wasn't a fan of the visuals or sound tracks, I rarely find a series with good original sound tracks. I heard a lot of hype around the first opening done by Lisa but I didn't jump on the bandwagon. The voice actors all performed their jobs well and I can't dock them any points for bad performances.\\n\\n\r\nThe sour taste makes me think the writers could have done better job in the second half of SAO with the ALO arc. When the writers tried to throw another person into the relationship between Asuna and Kirito it felt too forced. The whole scenario could have been avoided due to the nature of it being a cousin  on cousin relationship even if it was one sided. In the ALO arc I really hoped for more battle scenes and fights but was only presented with a handful of average fight scenes and maybe one good scene. The whole idea of the second half was to travel some distance to the World Tree which ended in a number of episodes of wasted time. It made it feel like the Frieza/Goku fight from Dragonball, really just a lot of wasted time. Then the writers tried to add another plot branch which involved the world of ALO simply being a test bench for mind control. This concept seemed idiotic because it adds multiple goals to derail the central theme and goal along with everything else. The writing was just really not that great for the second half.\\n\\n\r\nThe concept of a virtual reality RPG isn't something I wish on the world. There are a number of people who die from gaming incidents already in the modern age. To some people a virtual reality world would have more of an appeal to someone leading to a decline in their mental and physical health. Simply put its not something I would wish on the world as a casual gamer. I liked SAO for the most part but it was just put up a little higher than it deserved but I still enjoyed it.",

            "content": "With the beginning of the second season which is coming up soon, I thought I'd write a little review about SAO. My god this'll be horrible. Don't get me wrong, I love this anime, I simply dom't wanna rate it lower than i feel about it. But it cannot be helped. \r\nStory: The story is one of the biggest cockteases I have ever seen in my life. It starts out soo promising, with a vesry strong opening and first arch, but ultimately carries on way too fast with too many sideplots and simply boring archs (Talking about the honeymoon arch) to actually make it possiblefor the viewer to enjoy the mainplot. But all of that could be forgotten if the whole story didn't go bullocks after the first half of the anime. I really enjoyed SAO with it's lolicons and it's whatevers but the second half, ALO, was boring, predictable and stupid. Though I have to mention the awesome setting of SAO. That was it. 4/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: Now this is one of the two things where SAO shines. The artstyle is beatiful, with interesting settings (though one is a little too girly) which really give the feeling as if they really are in a mmorpg. Characterdesigns are awesome, every piece of armor having that typical medieval but still japanese adapted style to them taht people love about mmorpgs, which spawned a million SAO cosplays over the past two years. The monster designs are interesting but not too surprising or innovative. But hey, it's a mmorpg, what do you expect :D. The dungeons between the \"maps\" are the most interesting part of the environment, especially the \"Zebra\" dungeon. But the crown jewel of this anime are the action scenes, especially the bossfights being so well coregraphed and beatiful-looking that you wish you were a part of them. 9/10\\n\r\nPs: But the most important part of the art is....\\n\\n\r\nSound: ...that it's in prefect sync with the beatiful soundtrack by Yuki Kajiura. The opening is maybe a little girly but nevertheless good for a few hours of repetetive listening while playing WoW, Aura kingdom, Guild Wars or whatever you like to play. but the opening is nothing compared to the well timed medieval soundtracks in the towns, the highly orchestral pieces out on the fields, inside dungeons and in bossfights. Seriously, you feel, sorry for being repetetive, as if you are in an mmorpg. I know I say that too often but I think that's what the soundtrack and the art should deliver here. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Again, this is one strike to the balls (Or the ovaries, depending on which gender you are). Let's go through them chronologically: Kirito, the main character, is a lone wolf who somehow manages, by being a total dick toards most people, creating a harem. No idea what the girls see in him: \"OOh, he's soo alone but he actually looks okay and he's cool because he's the only one wearing black. I think I want to f*** him\". Something like that. It's just soo unrealistic, especially in the world of gaming. Moving on: Asuna. She's the incarnation of this whole anime. Really awesome first half, shitty second half. She seriously has negative character development, evolving from a very interesting, independent and stong female character to your generic moe blob that can't do anyting without her bf. This is a sad day for female leading roles.......anyways next: The Harem consists of a lot of uninspired female characters whose archs are mainly solved within one episode, including the shy scared one, the hyper one, the one you wish to be your little siste, the actual little sister and the ....daughter?! Ehh, I'll be honest....I love Yui because she's the only haremgirl that neitehr want to fuck him nor want to be his wife. She simply loves Kirito and Asuna and I think that's something awesome, though her arch was boring as fuck. Also, her voice is by Kanae itou.....I love Kanae Itou........anyways there are still a lot of characters to go, but I don't want to refelct on all fo them. The first villain is awesome, the second one is not. The first love is awesome(at least in the first half), the second one is not.(Leafa/Suguha was forced into this anime way too much)\\n\r\nI love the fact that they even included this background dude that actually acted like he was a girl but then turns into the 30 year old creep :D\\n\r\nThe last thing I must mention that it's awesome to see how the gamers are completely perplexed and mentally crushed after they heard that they are stuck in the game and slowly develop to find a liking to SAO and it's daily life, much different than Log Horizon f/e where everyone except for the maincast falls into a deep depression and the maincast is just like \"So....we're stuck in this game, huh? Okay.\". Realistic, but overall mediocre. 5/10\\n\\n\r\nNow my personal Enjoyment: I really liked this anime and I enjoy rewatching it every three months. It has some fatal flaws and yes, the long awaited OVA was just a beach episode with Asuna having a stupid haircolor which made me think of her as Nerine from Shuffle! the whole time but taht doesn't matter. I don't know why, but I'd recommend this anime to anyone, though I realise it has some really great faults and stupidities and so on, but....this is it. This is the dream many of us had for years: Being able to live in a game, I would seriously give up all i have to do that and I think that's why I love this anime so much. Enjoyment 8/10\\n\\n\r\nWell, this results in an overall 7/10, there are some animes out there that are a lot better, but no one who enjoys playing videogames can deny that this is a dream. A dream that will hopefully come true soon enough for us to still enjoy it. I think that is also why there are so many people in the community that call this the best anime ever without taking any criticism: Because they don't want their dreams to be crushed. So everyone out there who reads this: Don't be to harsh one those who believe this is one of the best anime ever.",

            "content": "Now, before I start, if you're a hater, go ahead read this, but I'm not gonna overly hate this, but I'm also not going to say, \"OMG! I love SAO!!!\" or anything fanboyish, but I'm going to bring out a positive view on this anime, so hater, fanboy or maybe even the rare newbie of anime, go ahead, I welcome you to read this. I'm gonna try to point out common negatives and positives without getting meticulous. So where do we start...\r\nStory: Alright, alright, I know, plot was nonexistent, pretty much that is. The idea was actually not that bad, people stuck in a MMORPGwhere if they die there, they die in real life. Not that bad, huh? Well they kinda slaughtered it. I'm gonna give them some brownie points for being able to fit some what of a good story line in the first and last few (at least they attempted to go back on track, too many side adventures) episodes. Any one who watches this anime normally comes out saying it was rushed, which it was. In 14 short episodes, they tried to fit in a story, romance, action, adventure, etc. and did an alright job but went way far off focus on everything and put all effort into useless side adventures. This entire idea, being trapped in a game of death, could have been stuck in 50 episodes, making the anime much better by far in my opinion. There are points where are MC (I'll get to him later) is on one floor and level, then the very next episode is at least 15 floors up and probably an extra 20 levels at that! Where the hell did levels 50-70 go? I'll bring up Character Development in a second because that has a lot to do with how quickly this show moved on. Oh yeah, if you can't handle some cliche lines and actions, I'd suggest getting away. There are parts where I couldn't handle some things, along with some WTF? moments. Episode 2: Guy dies rather than taking a simple healing potion... WTF? Take that stuff and get back up! Then Kirito takes blame for what happened with the beta testers and becomes a beater, which is quite heroic, because if you actually look into the contexts, he's saving all the other beta tester's asses (What he said isn't true, he's just trying to help his fellow BT from getting harassed). Back on the story, oh wait, we can't go back because we have to stick in 10 episodes of side stories that get in the way. There are way to many! Characters that never make a needed appearance are added and waste the precious time this anime needed! C'mon man! Get it together and go beat some bosses in your spare time! As much as they wasted time, some of the adventures were nice to see, but also extremely weird at the same time, its a jumbled mess, that's what it is.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10 Anime was really rushed, not enough time put into it at all, side stories aren't really needed. They tried, tripped, fell on their face, but get some points for a good first 2 episodes and actually attempting to do something at all. Everything smashes together and becomes a mess.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Scenery in this. Wow. You gotta admit, it's pretty impressive. Good views of landscape, mountains, tress, lakes, sun, most large scaled views are quite nice.They actually are calming and peaceful in my own opinion. But in terms of the art animation, it's a bit iffy. At moments, people bodies seem disproportional and not really fit to themselves. Sometimes, I think I've seen duplicate characters, there's no individualism, like everyone sorta looks the same exact way. The only other thing are the battle scenes. Sometimes I hate them, sometimes I love them. I've seen elongated limbs and awkward body positions that don't seem quite right. Sometimes there are shot screen battles, but really aren't as bad as people say they are, most of the battles are actually really good with somewhat smaller details that would even make them look slightly mediocre. Other than that, the battles are epic, intensified looks, nice looking attacks, that don't really look repetitive at all, and a general satisfaction feeling to see them, appealing to the eye. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10 Excellent scenery, but at a couple of moments, things just look weird but aren't very noticeable. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Music is amazing, well timed, and if you actually listened somewhat, just normal sounds are sharp and not very dull or boring. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10 Good stuff, makes you feel rather than just hear.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Oh boy, here we go. Kirito! Rather than what you've probably heard, he's quite likable if you're accepting enough. Alrighty, now if you don't know what an introvert is I suggest you look it up because here's a very good example of one! Quite, somewhat socially awkward, doesn't really always know what to say at given times, but holds a lot of anger and heart inside of him. Like some introverted people, if you unleash the beast, well you might just be screwed. If you can understand his position, you will understand Kirito. He's a solo player, but just because of that does that mean he's going to just let people die? No he's a good person, and in that world, it's pretty much life or death, so it's easy to see his good intentions. Here's the issue: he doesn't really seem to have any flaws, none, zip, zero, nada. Along with his partner Asuna, they're perfect teenagers. Kind, good, smart, helpful, anything that sounds good, you got these main characters. Also bring in the fact he gets pretty much anything he want, ehh things aren't really complicated for our MC here. Well yeah, they tried to make things seems difficult with the \"I don't want you to die\" and \"I don't want to leave you\" or even the \"Lets live together forever, but we need to save everyone from this game\", but it didn't really fit in as a real major conflict. Now, Asuna is a whole different... actually exact same thing as Kirito, strong, powerful, except she's an extrovert and is more of a leader. But nonetheless they have the same ideas and plan implied into them, be good to others, become stronger, win the game. I must say, I really didn't want to complain about the characters much, they were nice, good, nothing really wrong with them, so by themselves they are pretty good. Oh yeah, Character development. None whatsoever. Everything just went too quickly and, ugh... it's no fun to see everything move that fast. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10 The characters aren't that bad, just a bit too perfect with little development.\\n\\n\r\nSide Characters: Well I think they deserve their own section so here it is. First of all, development isn't too much of an issue here. These guys aren't that important but add just a little to the story. Sachi, Silica, and Lizbeth aren't really needed at all. Sachi does eventually motivate Kirito even harder but still not necessary. Silica only eased his pain about his sister. And Lizbeth, well she didn't do crap. The stupid part is that they all fall for him eventually, but not more of the love a first sight, but more gradual, which is better, but still, they all started to like Kirito. Lizbeth when she met Kirito was probably a better addition to the story than a Liz that liked him. Of course, Kirito being who he is, even the watcher of the anime wouldn't expect him to always be on the lookout for a girlfriend. Now on the plus side, we got Agil, Klein, and look at that, even Heathcliff. Agil added another dimension of friendship which tags along nicely with Kirito's attitude. Klein has somewhat of a humorous attitude that is displayed nicely with the story, which loosens up some tension. Heathcliff looks immediately like a leader, and it is easy to see his strength. All three of these side characters add appropriately to the story, and all seem fairly stable and easy to connect with while the three girls don't make much of a difference, but it is noticeable. (No, I'm no sextist, it's actually what I think)\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.5/10 Not really as bad as everyone says, side stories not needed, but most of the side characters add nicely to build Kirito. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Trust me, there may be a lot of things to point out that are somewhat to really bad, this is a good anime. It's nice, if you can emotionally connect, you'll enjoy it, there's no real reason not to like it. It is quite addicting, and very nice to watch and is appealing to the eye. If you can't adapt to things quickly or can only take your time, this isn't for you. But if you can follow a story where ever it goes and actually appreciate what it is and how it works, this is one of the better anime out there. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10 It's not for everyone, but I would recommend it, its a fun thing to watch on occasion, and if you are new to anime, this is a fun and exciting starter to see, not something a major critic should watch and contemplate over. \\n\\n\r\nFinal\\n\r\nStory: 5/10\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10 Nice anime, needs more time to get everything in motion and should have took more time, that's the main reasons for its faults really. The only thing that kills it is the story, but if you can appreciate the show in itself, it actually if one of the better anime you could find. Not for extreme anime critics, but appealing to the eyes of almost all others. I would recommend Sword Art Online, I personally enjoyed it, although it isn't perfect, it's still a very good anime.\\n\\n\r\n*If I see anything that should be added or fixed, I will update this, as well as add things as the series carries on*",

            "content": "Now, here comes another review for Sword Art Online! Well, mostly. After receiving positive comments for my SAO II review about the guts I had to even post one, let alone an enjoyable review, I am now tackling the beginning and first adaptation of the SAO series. Hopefully, this review is different enough to appeal to both lovers and haters, anime newcomers and veterans, and anyone who doesn't fit into those very broad categories.\r\nNow onto my review of Sword Art Online, a two part, side-by-side comparison. Why? Well, let's proceed, shall we?\r\nStory: 6.8 (Sword Art Online Arc)\r\nThe first half of the series fields a fairlygood story, all matters aside. It has a great introductory episode, an okay but slightly confusing followup, and then a typical, and unfortunately rushed narrative. Take all of what I said before, and the story for me is a 5.5. But what makes it\u2019s a 6.8 are the side-stories. Mind you, not the supporting character introductions, but rather the more psychological, technological, and series defining aspects. To better understand my POV, look at every novel in the SAO series starting from the Gun Gale Online arc, where Reki Kawahara finally begins to realize the value of what makes this series special, and more precisely, all of his novels beginning with Mother's Rosario onwards, including his reboot of the original series, SAO :Progressive. The three episodes that showcase these characteristics are \"The Red-Nosed Reindeer\", \"Murder in the Safe Zone \u201c, and \u201cIllusionary Avenger\u201d. These episodes really are what makes SAO so appealing, both as a show to watch and a hypothetical case study. Without revealing any other details, let\u2019s just say Kawahara finally learned how to utilize these elements very well beginning with Mother\u2019s Rosario. Only because of them, do I believe the story is a 6.8. These episodes on their own are around a 7.6, with some of the best writing in the series, mainly because they were actually written much later than the actual narrative, but nonetheless, being paired with the \u201cokay\u201d, illogical, over-dramatic, mood-swinging, and very fun to watch narrative, as well as the \u201cmeh\u201d character introduction episodes, SAO\u2019s story isn\u2019t terrible\u2014 It just isn't anything close to the top tier such as Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 5.2 (Fairy Dance Arc)\\n\r\nThe second half of the anime has three good things. Real life interactions and immediate impacts, continuation of the technological case study, and a satisfying, if not provocative ending. This arc, out of all future and current arcs, seems destined to be the worst reviewed and weakest. The introduction of Kirito\u2019s cousin and her own experience with virtual reality was actually very nice, as it revealed how her own foray into the virtual world was what Kirito\u2019s could have been if not for the SAO incident. Her own real life training with her brother was a surprising and fun to watch sequence, drawing Kirito in his SAO fighting prime life back into the real world and how it would be different. But everything else can be seen as a failure. Asuna is reduced to a helpless maiden, who Kirito has to save, and a certain character forms a disastrous and inane love triangle.  The side characters play little to no part in the arc compared to secondary characters of the first arc, and have little to no mention in SAO II. Asuna has to deal with a sexually-driven and mediocre villain, with the ending of the arc cruelly featuring the once powerful battle commander as an adult toy. The best parts are how SAO is present technologically in the game, and how virtual reality could be used as safe tool for study of the human brain and mind. If not for the conclusive yet series continuing ending, which was much better than the first arc\u2019s, this arc could easily be rated a 4.8 instead. It is what it is, but it is always good to know that Kawahara learned and improved from his faults in his later novels.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: 9.7 (Sword Art Online and Fairy Dance Arcs)\\n\r\nThis is where SAO, and even beats out its successor series. The grand entrance to virtual reality, the distortion effect and sounds, the character action, both active and inactive, and the intense battles and atmosphere SAO provided was outstanding. With a very good opening from LiSA, and great voice actor castings, SAO, in both arcs, outclassed most of the other anime of 2012, and many other popular ones, due to A-1 Pictures\u2019 amazing job on the series. It\u2019s what kept the story so vivid for many anime newcomers, and what maintained the respect of critics. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5.5 (Sword Art Online Arc)\\n\r\nEasily the biggest and most negatively critiqued aspect of the series, with equal parts adoration and hatred. SAO, as good of a series that it is, fails with its characters. The two lead protagonists, Kirito and Asuna, are the biggest examples. Throughout the main narrative, Kirito is seen as cocky and emotionless, until he suddenly changes to emotional and caring for the rest of the arc. Asuna goes from scared and nervous, to shy and passive, to powerful and caring, to weak and dependent, all in one arc. With such random changes to characters, the basis of this all falls on the story. Being a single novel, SAO is a very rushed arc that begins with the first few months of SAO, before then promptly jumping to the last two weeks. This provides no character growth at all for the leads, and paired that with the better side stories, causes random shifts in their behaviors. The side characters are no better. Klein is introduced in the first episode, and is handled remarkably well, but is then forgotten, only reappearing in the side stories and as a background character for main narrative. Agil is introduced pretty well in the second episode, along with Asuna, but he remains the least developed character of SAO. The side stories introduce Lisbeth and Silica, two supporting characters, and effectively wraps up their value in significance, which very little to the story, in single episodes, only being mentioned off and on. Without solid leads, and a lack of secondary character usage in the arc, SAO leaves itself vulnerable to very negative critiques, and rightly so. Along with the weak secondary characters comes the love group, or harem, that Kirito forms, with little to no reason, and actually diminishes the relationship of Asuna and Kirito. However, seeing as this is a review created during the last episodes of SAO II, I have to admit one wish. SAO: Progressive, an effective retelling and reboot of the Aincrad arc, has done well with establishing the personalities of Kirito that the series later reveals, which the anime actually doesn\u2019t feature. With a more detailed story, and good character development for Kirito and Asuna in the first 3 volumes, I expect to also see the secondary characters be better handled throughout the story, become more integrated, and also explored in ways the anime never could attempt because of lack of material. Other than that, the first arc in its current shape fields a mediocre group, who, likeable as they are, won\u2019t be considered a good cast unless SAO: Progressive effectively recreates them and a possible anime adaption is created on it. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4.3 (Fairy Dance Arc)\\n\r\nWith mediocre characters already to begin with in SAO, things only get worse in ALO, the VRMMO of SAO\u2019s Fairy Dance Arc. Suguha, Kirito\u2019s cousin, is the only notable character introduced, as she becomes part of the main cast and is a fairly likeable character, if not for a certain terrible romantic plot that effectively has not been repaired for any fan of SAO. The secondary characters of SAO are all missing in the second arc, with only Kirito, Asuna and their SAO child/fairy Yui returning. Kirito has absolutely no character development, as the mad-in-love hero tries to do the impossible in another VRMMO and save his beloved. Asuna is tortured, but not as a strong-willed heroine deserves to be, but rather as a toy for Noboyuki, the disgusting, disturbing, and sadly realistic lecher. The other side characters are gone within minutes, and only are there for more fan-service and drawn-out battles. With a forgettable story that both isn\u2019t buoyed by its cast and a story that weakens its cast, Fairy Dance effectively adds unneeded character elements, that are fortunately removed for the most part from the rest of the series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9.5 (Sword Art Online and Fairy Dance Arcs)\\n\r\nThe reason this part of the review is combined, other than the obvious reasons for Animation and Sound, is because enjoyment of the whole adaptation is something I think has to be considered. SAO is a very sloppy anime, with extreme lows and highs, consistent with the material it uses, and overall an okay anime. But the fact is it\u2019s enjoyable, for the novice and for the veteran. For a novice, like myself a few years ago, the amazing sound, animation were the two things that convinced me to watch anime, and the outstanding choreography and battle sequences, faithful to the Kawahara\u2019s writings and yet even better than what\u2019s provided. For a veteran, the guilty feeling of watching something that looks so good can\u2019t be denied, even if what actually occurs isn\u2019t itself anything noteworthy. SAO earns a 9.5 in Enjoyment because, though it fails to deliver its best aspects and manages to twists and complicate its often silly story, it is fun to watch, but for guilty entertainment and simple animation joy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.6\\n\r\nSAO was a good anime. It was enticing, aggravating, awe-inspiring, and disgusting in a small span of 24 episodes. For the show\u2019s lovers, every episode was worth watching, and for the haters, every episode was worth a rant. And yet, both sides watched the series for their own reasons. As someone who enjoyed SAO, and appreciates its two years on, the show was a success in my book for its great side stories with their technological and psychological elements, which Kawahara now fully embraces, and for the fact it drew a large amount of people to watch it and other anime from then on. SAO is no \u201ccreation of perfection\u201d, and neither is it a \u201csteaming pile of shit\u201d. It is a decent anime, that should be watched and remembered like others for years to come for its globally-altering effect. I hope that if you read this long-winded review, that you found it thoughtful and a nice read. Thanks everyone!\\n",

            "content": "Sword Art Online- this anime has been getting insane amounts of attention from Japan and many other countries. If you've never watched it, you've most likely heard of it. After a while of thinking, I've finally decided to do a review on this.\r\nJust warning you; if you're a Sword Art Online fan, you may find this review offensive- and that is because I am not a fan of Sword Art Online, although I am far from a hater of it, too.\r\nStory- 4\r\nA teenage boy who's a \"Hikikomori\" (Japanese for a shut in) named Kirigaya Kazuto buys the new video game called \"Sword Art Online\", anMMORPG. It is not just a regular MMORPG, though- you have to buy another program called the \"Nervegear\", which allows you to be in the game itself. Our main character, Kirigaya, goes into the game of Sword Art Online.\\n\\n\r\n Just as he's starting to have fun, though, he realizes there is no log out button and assumes it's a glitch. It actually isn't, though- the creator of the game informs them that it is there on purpose, and they cannot get back to real life now. They are stuck in Sword Art Online forever- that is, until someone beats the 100 floors/levels which are all increasingly difficult. Also, the players will take damage in not only the game but in real life, and can die in the game. If someone unplugs their \"Nervegear\", they die immediately.\\n\\n\r\nSo, there is basically no escape.\\n\\n\r\nSounds interesting, right? I thought it was at first too- actually, I still do think it is. But that's the problem with this anime- the idea of it is cool, which is why the first 3 episodes of the anime were fantastic, but that's about it.\\n\\n\r\nWhich is sad to say, because when the first few episodes came out I had great hope for this anime- hell, even after the first arc was over I still held a bit of a torch for it.\\n\\n\r\n As soon as it's done being introduced, the anime starts gradually going downhill. The plot is bland and predictable with no interesting turns or twists; They had great potential with the idea of this anime, but used it in a cliched, boring fashion.\\n\\n\r\nThe first arc of this series was alright, although a bit boring- but the second arc was what really made it deserve a four. The overuse of fanservice to keep you \"glued to the seat\"; the \"damsel in distress\" plot used once more; it was honestly very disheartening.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing about the plot I can commend is the battle scenes- they were very well written and kept me entertained. But, otherwise, the writing seemed very immature and uninteresting. I felt as though romance was the main thing that kept this anime going, which is odd because it has the label \"shounen\" and is an action anime.\\n\\n\r\nThere were also plenty of plot holes and questionable moments; for example, in the last episode when Kirito uses this \"super power\" type of fighting that he never had before. There was even a moment where he was SPOILER: dead but came back to life for no reason?\\n\\n\r\nArt- 8\\n\\n\r\nOne of the key reasons that Sword Art Online is popular is it's artwork- the animation was really fantastic and breath taking at times, and the characters had great, interesting designs. The art style was average, but still very pretty and eye-catching.\\n\\n\r\nIf it weren't for this and the sound, I would've given Sword Art Online a lower score. But, if I can say one thing great about this anime it would be definitely about the animation. This is definitely in my top ten list of best animation from anime in 2012. The only problem is that art and sound are not what makes an anime good.\\n\\n\r\nSound- 9\\n\\n\r\nLike the artwork, the sound was flawless most of the time. The voices were great for the characters, the background music was surprisingly noticeable (unlike most anime) and the openings and endings were very catchy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- 3\\n\\n\r\nWhat I found even worse than the plot was the characters. Their designs are very eye-catching, but their personalities were very bland, cliched, and \"Mary Sue\"-like. For example, the main character, who mainly goes by his username \"Kirito\", is portrayed as a shut-in. Most people would look down in him in disgust, and most shut-ins have major problems. But not Kirito- all the girls around him at one point fall in love with him, and the only personality traits he has are brave and \"bad ass\". Along with this, he has ridiculous power in fighting for no reason. He has absolutely no flaws and never fails. Very boring.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, one girl named \"Asuna\" is shown as mysterious, cool and \"bad ass\" at first, but ends up being a stereotypical tsundere with no other personality trait except for brave.\\n\\n\r\nAll the characters have strikingly similar personalities, which makes none of them really stand out.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 5\\n\\n\r\nThe only times I really enjoyed the anime was the first arc's battle scenes- those were beautifully illustrated and acted out, and were heart-racing. But, other wise, I felt as if the series dragged on and on with nothing interesting going on, especially in the second arc. \\n\\n\r\nThe second arc, you couldn't even watch a battle scene without boobs 24/7- it was really ridiculous. I'm sure even some guys got sick of seeing one character's pair of boobs every 2 minutes. I felt as if the only thing that kept the series going was actually the fanservice. In one part, they even added tenticals- and aired this on tv...\\n\\n\r\nOverall- 6\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is good if you're looking for a timewaster- but if you're looking for something with great plot, I really suggest not watching it.\\n\\n\r\nThe only really good part of this anime was arc 1, and the only really good part of it was the beginning. Afterwards, it gets very aggravating and I actually had to force myself to watch the second arc, and when it was over I felt great relief- not at the ending, but just because it was over.",

            "content": "Story: The story starts off promising, but just turns out to be a clich\u00e9 romance.\r\nIts the future. Video game technology has become so advanced that u can literally play a game using your mind alone. \r\nA hyped up jrpg arrives, (named sword art online).\r\nHowever, not everything is as it seems. The evil creator of the game made it so that you will be forever trapped in this virtual world unless someone beats it, and the most disturbing fact is that if you die in the game you die in real life.\r\nWe go through the life of kirito (or kazuto, kirito is his avatars name) ashe tries to beat the game and ultimately end up in real life again.\\n\r\nHowever, halfway through the anime he falls in love with a fellow female player, Asuna. Aaaand the hunger games like anime gets replaced by a clich\u00e9 romance which is cometely unbelievable. \\n\\n\r\nSeriously.\\n\\n\r\nNot only is the relationship stupid and unbelievable, its also boring. They are basically a perfect couple. All you see them doing in the first half of the show is flirt with one another. They have no chemistry. They have no arguments whatsoever. Its ridiculous. It's basically an anime version of twilight.\\n\r\nAnd even twilight has a better love story. They actually have problems with their relationship. \\n\r\nSo basically the rest of the first arc is just episodes about kirito and asunas romance.\\n\r\nDon't even get me started with the second arc of the anime. Basically, to save asuna, kirito needs to go through an RPG with fairies. Oh, and did I mention that all the female fairies want to have sex with him? No, did I? That makes the second arc more sickening to watch.\\n\r\nLong story short, the story had a lot of potentially but it got executed poorly.\\n\r\nMark:2\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nPretty damn good. The art and animation look gorgeous but the character designs are pretty generic and they look the same in most other anime. The art really connects with the beautiful scenery of the virtual world, and the animation is fantastic, especially\\n\r\n in the action scenes, even though there aren't many of then.\\n\\n\r\nMark: 8\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nGreat. Sao has a good variety of tracks, and many of then set the mood for the scene, whether its a peaceful romance or an adrenaline- pumping action scene, it all fits.\\n\r\nThe openings are great too, along with the superb animation, making them a saving grace for the anime.\\n\\n\r\nMark: 8\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nEasily the anime's weakest point. There is not one interesting or likable character in the entire series. \\n\\n\r\nLet's start with the main character. He's basically a Gary stu. He had no personality and he is BORING. \\n\r\nHe's just... PERFECT. \\n\r\nHe manages to defeat every enemy effortlessly by himself.\\n\r\nHe gets all the ladies.\\n\r\nWhat he doesn't get is character development. He gets none. At all. Kirito is basically a wish fulfillment character for any stressed out male otaku/gamer because he is a loser who actually becomes a hero and a chick magnet.\\n\r\nIntroduced as a Gary stu, ends as a Gary stu.\\n\\n\r\nNow we get our female lead, asuna.\\n\r\nShe's basically a cliche love interest.\\n\r\nShe's just princess peach.\\n\r\nShe's a Mary stu. She had no depth in her personality and has no goal apart from kirito.\\n\r\nIronically, she was introduced as pretty bad ass, but after she fell in love with our hero, she's just become princess peach. Now she just cooks for our main character.\\n\r\nAlso, did I mention she was hot? No, I didn't. Oh well, she's really hot.\\n\r\nBuuut if she's so hot then why is she spending time with a loser like kirito and why is she playing a video game anyway.....\\n\r\nJust because someone's hot doesn't mean you'll like them. Same with asuna. Hot but has no personality at all.\\n\\n\r\nVillains: none. There are no real villains. Both villains in the series are stupid and have no real intentions or plans.\\n\r\nThey aren't meant to be taken seriously.\\n\\n\r\nSides: \\n\r\nNone. There are zero important side characters. All other males don't do anything, and the females just want sex with kirito. That's it. Literally.\\n\\n\r\nMark: 1\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: What do you think? It's basically a poorly written romance with nothing going for it.\\n\r\nThe art and sound can't make up for the abysmal characters and story.\\n\\n\r\nMark: 3\\n\\n\r\nVerdict:\\n\r\nSao had such a cool concept. If you passed it on to the creators of anime like fmab or something, then we'd definitely get a good anime \\n\r\nBut no. Just no.\\n\r\nThe characters are non-existant and the story is utter crap. Yes, animation and art is good, but there are many anime with the same level of animation and sound.\\n\r\nGo watch those instead of this piece of crap.\\n\\n\r\nPlease, for the love of god, do not watch this piece of shit.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2",

It wasn't a complete waste of my time nor was it the absolute best I've seen. I do not have regrets for watching this, but I can see why people have decided this anime to be less than average.\r\nStory: 4/10\r\nHonestly, the story wasn't all that great. It's basically your typical hero saves the world then finds the love of his life plot, and along the way he steals the hearts of other supporting female characters. The only reason why I'm tolerable with the story isbecause of the whole Heathcliff business. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nAn anime's art is quite a huge deal for me. It compels me to watch it since I'm in awe with the animation. If the art isn't as well done, then I may have a hard time trying to finish it. All that I can say is that you'll probably love the art as much as I do.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nAnother one of SAO's perks, the soundtrack. \"Crossing Field\" really excited me. Even though I usually skip theme songs, I barely did so for SAO. It sparks the adventurous side of you and really thrills you in an inexpressible way. I guess you could say it makes you want to do something. (And we all know how hard it is to get motivated nowadays.) In conclusion, I'd say the art and sound are just about as great!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 3/10\\n\r\nThe character plot is probably the most negative part of SAO. The main characters, with no particularly special background or personality that may link them together, fall in love for reasons unexplained. Their love seems undeveloped and rushed, like out of the blue they're suddenly a couple. Not only that, but the male lead is quite cliche in terms of his good qualities, such as kindness and determination, but that's pretty much it. He's just a gamer who manages to get some hot chicks in a virtual world. As for the minors or supporting characters, they seem like stepping stones for the male lead. They haven't any developed profiles, so it seems that their only use in the anime is to aid the hero in his quest for domination and freedom.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\r\nI'd say it was quite interesting to watch, even with the overly cliche plot. I rather liked Asuna and Yui, because they were just lovable in their own way. The SAO arc was probably the best and most enjoyable of all. If it weren't for the Alfheim arc, maybe this anime's ratings would be higher, because the honest truth is that Alfheim was utter bullcrap. Suguha pissed me off throughout the anime and don't even get me started on the psychotically, sadistic \"king\" of the damned game. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nTo be blunt, the only reason SAO gets a 6-7 rating from me is mostly because of its simply mesmerizing and captivating art and soundtrack. I suggest you watch SAO if you merely want some light enjoyment, because you ain't getting much from this.",

            "content": "Sword Art Online was a light novel series written by Kawahara Reki. It was adapted into an anime by A-1 Pictures, the same studio that brought us Valkyria Chronicles, Kuroshitsuji and Shin Sekai Yori. It's also proven to be a pretty divisive series, some people loving it others hating it. My friends who have seen it are pretty evenly split on the matter. So, as you can probably imagine, I've heard a few arguments about it. Which side is more accurate? \r\nStory: \r\nOur story opens with the release of a highly anticipated virtual reality game, the titular Sword Art Online. Our protagonist, Kirigaya Kazuto (playername Kirito) is one of ten thousand players to log in. He has an advantage having been one of the beta testers. That's when things get serious. The game's creator, Kayaba Akihiko, traps all of the players inside the game with no way to log out. To make matters worse, their nerve gear devices will cause their deaths if forcibly removed by someone in the real word and if they die in the game, they will die in reality. The only way to return to the real world is to beat all 100 floors of SAO. \\n\\n\r\nIn all fairness, that premise is really promising and could have been really interesting. The problem is that the execution is shoddy. Kayaba has no real motivation. You eventually do learn why he did it, but his actions don't logically follow from it. There is absolutely no reason that, with the motivation given, he should trap players in the game or kill them. The minor villains are just as bad. Apparently, in this game of life and death with only ten thousand players, there are enough sociopaths to form a PKing guild. It, frankly, doesn't ring true in the slightest. Even the biggest jerks out there would be far more likely to cooperate with other players if only to save themselves, than to try and murder them.\\n\\n\r\nThe series also suffers from major time skips. I get that there are a lot of floors to go through, but if there was nothing interesting to do with the vast majority of their progress, why would you set the upper limit that high? The vast majority of the time skips just serve as a lazy plot device to avoid having actual character development. Instead they show something happen, skip ahead to something else and character relationships have changed however the story needed them to. They don't have to explain it because several months passed. The attempts at drama also suffer as a result. There are several cases where they'll introduce a character, kill them off at the end of the episode, treat it as a dramatic event and then never mention them again. Seriously, if you want us to care about a character you have to actually develop them as a character or make their death matter in some way. Then we have the \u201cromance\u201d aspects. Our two leads have basically no chemistry and girls seem to flock to our protagonist for no real reason. I get the impression that Kawahara just wanted to incorporate harem elements.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said the execution is pretty shabby, until the second arc. In the second arc we get a new villain with actual motivations and the story also gets much, much worse. They introduce Kirito's sister as a major character and she has an incestuous crush on him. Did I mention that this is the same studio behind the second series of the repulsive OreImo? Okay, so she's really just his first cousin who he was raised with as siblings, that doesn't make it any less disgusting. Seriously, either of those would make this a really gross turn in its own right why would combining the two make it somehow okay? Our action girl heroine is also reduced to being a damsel in distress. The series uses that fact to introduce creepy non-consensual sexual stuff, which it doesn't even come close to handling well. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this are mostly just dull. They fit a basic trope and never move out of it. Asuna is your typical action girl. The various supporting characters are pretty much non-characters who are defined by one or two traits, which is a pretty serious issue when they try to make one of their deaths dramatic. Our major antagonists are the generic villain with vague motivations and the obvious sociopath, who somehow avoids detection. Kirito is your stock dumb nice guy protagonist. His stupidity can get annoying, though. This is a guy who seriously tries to argue that sacrificing the re-spawning NPCs in order to advance is wrong. Sugu is probably the worst with her major defining characteristic being that she wants to romance her own brother. \\n\\n\r\nART: \\n\\n\r\nThe art is mostly pretty good. It has some really creative aspects and the online world is portrayed in a pretty dynamic way. The fight scenes flow pretty well too. The biggest problem with the art is the propensity towards fan-service. This series seriously has gratuitous fan-service shots of a girl who isn't even in High school, including a bathing scene, a random shot that puts the focus on her bum and a scene of her in her undergarments. The whole objectifying women to provide fan-service aspect is bad enough when the character in question is a grown woman, but when she's a recent Middle School graduate it just gets into really despicable territory. \\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\\n\r\nThe acting in this isn't very good. The lines tend to be either exaggerated or listless. There are a few good acting moments, but they're few and far between. They got some good actors, they just didn't give them anything to work with. The music is the best part of the series. It isn't anything special, but it's okay.\\n\\n\r\nHo-Yay:\\n\\n\r\nThe Ho-yay factor is a 2/10. There's one scene where Klein offhandedly says that Kirito is his type but they never do anything with it. They don't even clarify whether it was serious or a jest on Klein's part. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts: \\n\\n\r\nSword Art Online is a classic example of a good premise being decimated by the execution, which goes from slipshod in the first arc to unpleasant and downright nasty in the second. The characters are one-dimensional and the acting conveys that. All in all it's a series that starts out pretty mediocre and takes a very sharp downward spiral. My final rating is going to be a 2/10. Next week, Shingeki no Kyojin.",

            "content": "I know, I'm a bit late on reviewing this one. But I had intended to write this review for quite a while. Sword Art Online was undoubtedly the most popular anime of 2012. It was one of those shows that took the anime world by storm and forced every anime fan to pick a side. No one cared about your opinion on if you're on the fence. So I refrained from talking about it too much in the forums. I kept switching sides as it was airing but neither bandwagon appealed to me in the end. So here is a review of Sword Art Onlinefrom the perspective of someone who remained indecisive until the bitter end.\\n\\n\r\nSword Art Online is set in the near future where the first ever VRMMORPG (Virtual Reality Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game) named 'Sword Art Online' has been released. Through a device called 'Nerve Gear', people can control their avatars with their minds. Lead character Kirito is a hardcore gamer and beta tester for the game 'Sword Art Online'. After buying the game, he starts it up and is transported into the game fantasy world. Moments after starting, the creator of the game announces to all the players that the log out button has been disabled and they are trapped in that world. The only way to get out is to beat the game. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, there is a catch. If you die in the game, you die in real life. This catch adds a sense of danger which I welcomed at first. However, while it is emphasised a lot in the first few episodes, it soon fades into the background along with many other interesting ideas as the story twists and turns. Many of these twists and turns are what drags the show down. The story makes pretty much all the wrong choices when it comes to plot twists. Some of them I actually enjoyed like the romance element. But even they ended up becoming stale after just a few episodes. There's also a heavy use of other plot devices most notably being the use of deus ex machina. The lead characters are rarely in any real danger but pretty much every time they are, the battle almost always ends with some nonsensical plot device  that turns the tables and gives them the victory. In the end, there wasn't much I liked about the story. While it had potential, it was ruined by the writers' insistence on on plot devices and big twists in an attempt to spice up the story even when it's completely unnecessary.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, not everything in the show is sub-par. A1 Pictures still brought their A-Game even when the source material wasn't so crash hot. Make no mistake, this is one very pretty show. From the imaginative fantasy themed backdrop to the highly detailed character designs to the proportions of a certain female character. The art never misses a beat. The animation is also very notable. One thing about this show I cannot fault is the amazing fight scenes. While quite rare, A1 proves that they can handle themselves even when tackling large scale fight scenes. They do a surprisingly good job given the small amount of action centric anime they make. But of course the animation is not without its faults. There are a few corners cut here and there and some weird facial expressions. But despite that, the visuals are solid. Probably much better than a show of this quality should have deserved.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the sound, Sword Art Online's score is handled by none other than Yuki Kajiura of Madoka Magica and Fate/Zero fame. While it's still a great score that definitely deserves a mention, it's not particularly memorable. I wouldn't listen to the OST on its own like with Madoka Magica. That being said, it still works very well in the context of the show. There were times where the score was so emotional that I was almost tricked into believing something amazing was going on screen and not some cheesy Twilight esque romance. With my extremely limited knowledge of the Japanese language I'd say that the voice work is solid. Although sometimes the characters overract to the point where their forced emotion transcends language barriers. But all in all, I'd say the voice acting is very much above the norm. Same with the amazing music. Especially 'Crossing Field'.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough wish I could say the same for the characters. While I found the lead character Kirito interesting at first, I soon started to realise a pattern. Pretty much every time he was in a fight, he won. It's rare to find overpowered characters outside of shonen action. Especially in the modern age. It's even more out of place in a show like this which is meant to be aimed at a much older audience. But at the start of the show, Kirito is already an experienced player who can take on pretty much everyone without breaking a sweat. If his high skill level benefited the story, I would forgive it. However, it only works to hinder the sense of danger which originally drew me into this show. \\n\\n\r\nFemale lead Asuna is also a victim of bad storytelling going from mysterious badass to bland love interest to damsel in distress and back to bland love interest in the end. The villains don't fair very well either. Kayaba Akihiko's intentions are or his reasoning behind his actions are never explained. Even worse is Sugou Noboyuki. The show tries way too hard to drive in just how evil the guy is. He's so evil that the other villain seems like a nice guy in comparison. At least, that's the reaction they wanted you to have. But he's so over the top and ridiculous looking that I ended up liking him more than the main cast for all the wrong reasons. Overall, the characters had a lot of potential but the poor storytelling let them down and turned even the most likeable characters into walking stereotypes.\\n\\n\r\nWhile this show had a lot of flaws, I will once again say something nice about the show. It was a fun ride and I don't regret it one bit. Watching the show every week, seeing people complaining about the latest asspull, reading stupid Internet articles praising the show at the halfway point, seeing another article from the same guy about how bland the show was in retrospect, the Internet memes, the forum threads (Suguha's boobies), the Twilight comparisons, the new fans who praised the show, the new fans who jumped on the hate bandwagon, the Naruto comparisons and the glopping noises. Even though I never truly picked a side, it was very entertaining watching both sides fighting it out. Thank you anime community. You made this otherwise disappointing show fun for all of us.\\n\\n\r\nUnrelated extreme subjectivity aside, the show wasn't a total disaster. But it wasn't very good either. It had it's moments but they were all balanced out by the flaws. I sat on the fence the entire time and stayed there no matter how tempting both sides were. There were things I liked about the show which made me want to be part of the fanbase, but there were things so bad that I wanted to hop on the hate bandwagon. Overall, the show is extremely mediocre. If this is the future of anime, I don't want to watch anime any more. It was a fun ride but not a very good show. You can count me in for Season 2 but I'm still sceptical about the show's future.",

            "content": "I first watched Sword Art Online some while back because at the time I heard consistently good things about it in several reviews. This anime put forth the standard that the more hyped an anime is, the more skeptical I should be when watching it. Sword Art Online is the epitome of an anime starting off with a decent concept but not being able to live up to it in the end.\r\nSTORY: The story is a relatively simple plot to follow at first. Thousands of players are testing a new Virtual Reality MMO, and get trapped in the game. If they die in the game,they die in real life. Instantly, threat is established and it seems as though the story is off to a good start. However, this is where things start to fall flat, in more ways than one. Pacing is inconsistent throughout the show, with several time skips of varying lengths, often times confusing the viewer and forcing them to readjust to the sudden changes. I will not spoil anything, but each episode feels like the viewer has to go back and make sure they didn't skip one with how often time skips occur. As for the plot, it starts to go downhill as soon as they take the focus away from the main story to focus more on episodic experiences, and it takes away some of the dire feel of the situation. As for season 2, to sum it up in a non-spoiler fashion, the viewer is treated to a sub-par villain with a situation that's far less dire than before, so the sense of danger that at least was felt in the first half of SAO is no longer prevalent, and it feels tacked on just for the sake of elongating the plot. 3/10\\n\\n\r\nART: One plus I can give to the show is that the art style is relatively nice to look at. The animation is high quality and the backgrounds are pleasant, and it looks as though enough effort was put in to at the very least make the anime visually appealing, but that's all there really is to say about it. I've certainly seen better, but it definitely doesn't look awful. 7/10 \\n\\n\r\nSOUND: Similar to the art style, the music is relatively nice, but rather forgettable. There really isn't much to say about the music at all honestly, considering just how forgettable it is. It'd be one thing if any of it stood out in a good OR bad way, but it's rather bland in some places and rather decent in others, so there's really nothing that special about it. 4/10\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (Minor spoilers, I'll do my best to keep it vague): In my opinion, this is where SAO takes its biggest hit. The cookie cutter plot was one thing, but the characters (or lack thereof) just have no redeeming qualities throughout the entirety of the show. Let me start off by saying there is practically no supporting cast. The story revolves around Kirito and Asuna (and another character to an extent, Yui). Minor characters are brought in briefly and then pushed aside, only brought back on occasion for fights or a quick cameo scene. I could perhaps forgive this if the main characters weren't so bland! I hate having to say this about a character in a show, but Kirito feels so bland. I'm not going so far as to say he's perfect, but he feels as though he has no flaws. He's smart, incredibly skilled, popular with many women (despite it being said that he's not good with talking to people, particularly women early on), and he never really changes or develops as a character. I won't spoil anything, but he's simply not written in a way that allows for the viewer to relate to him on any level. He's also inconsistent; one moment he'll be an emotional wreck, and the next scene he'll be back up on his feet with no problem right away. The same can be said for Asuna, the female lead. She starts off as an independent, strong willed character, then just a couple episodes in she completely does a 180 without any sort of indication as to why she would change as a character. I wish I could say the villains were at least written well, but the first antagonist of the show has non-existent motives, and the second antagonist is so cookie-cutter in that he's written specifically to be unlikable so that any sane viewer would hate him with ease. That does not make a well written villain. It feels lazy and uninspired, like the rest of the characters in this anime do.  1/10\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: I really tried to give this anime a chance. Despite how south it seemed to go merely 10 episodes in, I chose to keep watching, hoping it would get better. Unfortunately, it did not. Even when death was a constant risk in the first half of the series, this show never gave me any reason to care if any of them died. The second half of the show brings in an awful subplot involving Kirito's cousin who is attracted to him, which just has no real reason to be a part of the show. It feels like it's there to be there, while the rest of the show just feels boring and like they just needed to get this finished. I didn't enjoy this, and found myself consistently questioning the directions in which it was going, and not in a good way. 2/10\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: Just about anything bad to be said about this show has been said before, so I'll leave it as simple as this. It was hyped so much, and disappointed me so much in the end because I was expecting a grand adventure, and it left me feeling like I'd just wasted my time. When it comes to seasonal anime like this, there are always going to be those who enjoy it and those who don't. If you want something pretty to look at and don't care about plot, and don't mind weakly written characters, then just maybe you'll enjoy this a little. However, if you're like me and you have a fondness for well written characters that you can relate to, and an engaging story that will keep you excited start to finish, I would definitely NOT recommend this anime to you at all.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 3/10. Interesting idea, but poorly executed. I would not recommend watching it.",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**\r\nIn case you haven't noticed by now, Sword Art Online is the most polarizing anime since Neon Genesis Evangelion; maybe even more polarizing. That is not hyperbole; SAO actually is that divisive. People will either put this show on the highest of pedestals and claim that it's the greatest masterpiece ever erected, or they will crucify it for being the most overhyped, flawed, inconsistent  piece of sh*t in anime history. Well newsflash anime fans: SAO does not deserve either one of those stigmas. The truth about SAO lies on a neutral ground; it must be watched without the sky-high expectations that thefan base has given it in order to objectively review it. It has many strengths and many weaknesses; there is nothing about SAO that is just \"okay\". Every aspect of it is either very good or very poor, making it hard to review.\\n\\n\r\nPlot: 3/10\\n\r\nIn the near future, a Virtual Reality MMORPG video game called Sword Art Online has been released where players control their avatars with their bodies using a piece of technology called Nerve Gear. However, players soon discover they cannot log out of the game, as the game creator is holding them captive until they reach the 100th floor of the game's tower and defeat the final boss. However, the twist is that if they die in the game, they die in real life too.\\n\\n\r\nAs a fan of video games myself, the concept of SAO had my attention from the very start. However, the first few episodes set a poor tone for the series. SAO makes a pretty horrendous first impression by giving its first four episodes some of the most poorly paced and badly written content I've seen.  The first few episodes are supposed to capture the emotional trauma that the characters of the game are going through as they realize the situation that they are in, particularly the protagonist Kirito, which is exactly what they should have tried to do; however, it is executed terribly. Everything simply happens way, way too fast.  The audience is expected to develop emotional connections to characters that have been on screen for about ten minutes total, there are several time skips of significant length at inopportune times, and worst of all, the show expects you to believe that Kirito has undergone some sort of emotional transformation. Kirito, whose biggest problem is the fact that he is completely flawless (more on characters later), was clearly supposed to be dynamic and actually learn something or change from these first episodes, but they didn't spend half the time they needed to on this aspect of the plot to effectively portray Kirito's flaws. The lackluster nature of these four episodes end up dragging down the rest of the anime, all the way until the final episode, which is a shame.\\n\\n\r\nLuckily, starting at around episode five, SAO finally starts to have an enjoyable plot when it enters its first real story arc; trying to clear the 100 floors of the tower and beat the game.  The element of suspense and knowing that characters who die are dead for good ends up being the driving force of the plot, and for a while, it works. The immersive atmosphere of the game is actually pretty enjoyable and it made for a more engrossing storyline then some people give the show credit for. \\n\r\nThe other main aspect that begins to develop is the romance between Kirito and the female lead; Asuna. The romance appears promising at first glance; two people who are going through difficult emotional times begin to rely on each other until they eventually fall in love. Unfortunately, the relationship between the two becomes increasingly unrealistic and feels less genuine as time goes on. This is because Asuna develops an unrealistic reliance on Kirito while Kirito is\u2026 well\u2026 perfect, as usual. It becomes less about the relationship between the two and more about Kirito being a badass and propping up the completely objectified Asuna, but again, more on characters later.\\n\r\nWhen SAO enters its second arc following a major plot twist, SAO really begins to go downhill fast. I can't elaborate on anything in the second arc due to spoilers, but here is the gist of it: the suspense of the first arc is nowhere to be found, nothing the characters do has any meaning anymore, an unbelievably uncomfortable side-plot is added, and the behavior of the characters becomes completely inconsistent and nonsensical. It is this second arc that completely sunk the plot of SAO and really took away any chance the show had of becoming a great anime. Really  the plot was just very poorly written.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nAbsolutely stunning, eyegasmic, breathtaking animation. The animation in SAO is maybe the absolute greatest I have seen in any anime I've ever watched. It's bright, colorful, crisp, fluent, and just plain beautiful. There is an argument to be made that SAO is worth watching for no other reason then to see this masterful artwork. Some of the most well-animated action scenes in history.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nA pretty great soundtrack. The first opening is very good and the in-show music is utilized very well. The voice acting is superb in both the sub and the dub. The sound in SAO is well above average.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 1/10\\n\r\nThe characters are the worst aspect of SAO for reasons that are not hard to see. Even if you put aside the fact that the protagonist is a poorly written character, there is absolutely no excuse for the complete and total objectification of the female characters, which consist of about 80% of the remaining significant characters.\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with the protagonist; Kirito. If you have seen one character like this, you have seen them all. Kirito is a perfect human being; he is purposely written to be ridiculously awesome so that the younger male viewers of the show (SAO's target demographic) will put themselves in Kirito's shoes. All the girls are falling in love with you for no reason, you are a total badass who can take anyone in a fight, etc. Kirito was made to pander to the male-power fantasies of the younger audience, so to be fair, SAO accomplished exactly what they wanted to with this character. Unfortunately for the rest of the audience who isn't in this demographic, Kirito is just irritating to watch. There is nothing special about him and yet the entire universe kneels and worships him as a God; it just makes absolutely no sense what so ever.\\n\\n\r\nAt first, Asuna seems like she might be the only female character who isn't treated as a object in the show, but much to my dismay, whatever integrity she may have had is stripped away in the blink of an eye and is further molested with each passing episode. In episode 21, the show hits absolute rock bottom in this regard (you know the scene I'm talking about, fans   -_-), and watching this process is just nauseating.  It's not just Asuna either; every female character that Kirito meets falls absolutely head over heels in love with him for no reason what-so-ever and proceeds to spend the remainder of their screen time swooning over him like the hopeless toolbags that they are. It is just downright insulting to women, and you don't have to be a female to be offended by that. SAO is a pretty good model of how NOT to write characters, particularly female ones; they have no real motivations or complexity at all.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\r\nDoes Sword Art Online live up to it's hype? No, it most certainly does not. However, if you watch it without sky-high expectations, MAYBE it could be worth your time; but only if you are someone who can appreciate truly masterful animation. Be prepared to suffer through a very poorly written plot and horribly written characters, should you decide to watch it. I don't recommend it, but hey, clearly a lot of people liked it.",

Good thing the graphics for this game are pretty decent, or I'd probably commit suicide. I don't work well with shitty graphics.\r\nI'm also starting to get the hang of being an elite solo player in this game. I for one, don't have many friends, or intend to make any, because they would probably impede my progress as an elitist. The benefit of being a BETA tester is the fact that I know all thebest ways to grind my levels. Call me a BEATER all you want, but I'm not dying in this crazy world.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some very interesting characters in this game. Agil for example, is this buff 6 feet 5 guy that likes to rip people off with his merchanting skills. We all look like our real life counterparts, so I don't get why this guy is not Pking or something. But he's a good and reliable friend nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nThere's also a lot of hot girls in this game for some reason. I'm not complaining. I met this girl called Asuna, and wow she's good on the eyes. She's pretty strong as well, and all the nerds in Aincrad drools when they see her. I better not associate myself with her, as I like to stay low profile. However, she insists on bugging me all the time, but I actually don't mind after a while. The people in this game are pretty cool, I guess. But I'm the coolest.\\n\\n\r\nI'd rate this game a 8/10. Could be higher if some floors weren't as easy as they currently are. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "This is my first review. Bare with me.\r\nPeople will immediately shut me down for saying \"8?! YOU OVERRATED THIS ANIME.\"\r\nSorry, I don't believe I did, and I will explain why.\r\nStory: *semi-spoiler* Now we know episode 1 was great. It had a lot of potential. I was thinking \"How awesome would it be.. if we had virtual reality MMORPGs like this?\" Obviously without the trapping and you die you die situation.\r\nSo anyway. The idea there is great. Actually it's pretty fantastic, because it's something a lot of people would want in reality. So we have a great idea, whats next? Oh.. cool we now know there'sa tragedy at foot, and you cannot log out, you need to finish the game.\\n\\n\r\nHere's the part where people are like \"Awesome! Let's see how this turns out!\"\\n\r\nThen on episode 2 people get confused. Then episode 3 people get even more confused.. and eventually get annoyed and write reviews and get upset. \"WAAHHH THIS IS A FAILURE, SO MUCH POTENTIAL LOST *rages* WHY DOES THIS HAVE SUCH A HIGH RATING?\" Well I will tell you why. The LN has a 1.5 year time skip, and it's a bunch of arc's.. and we watch these arcs. (Episode 2-6) Are the arcs, it's a bad idea for a series to start with arcs.. but they wanted to do the show chronologically, which for the LN readers.. is a great idea.\\n\r\nLet me tell you, after episode 7 it should get better. *I hope* in the sense where.. what I have heard from my friends who have read the LN they say that the episodes 2-6 were arc's taken place chronologically, and the story becomes a lot better. So like I said, bare with the series, watch episode 7.. then 8.. then please edit your reviews to the new standards.\\n\\n\r\nIt's like this (Chronologically if you were reading the LN) Episode 1, Episode 7, episode 8, episode 2, episode 9, episode 3, episode 10, episode 4 (and so on) It's just that in the anime it becomes chronological, while in the manga it made sense. Eventually it all will make sense.\\n\r\nFor the blunder of causing people to be confused and not explaining it properly: 7/10 for the story. Penalized -1 for it.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The artwork is amazing, people got all \"The backgrounds are awful and they don't move in the show\" Well.. obviously. It's a splashwork, in a lot of MMORPG's you will have a boundry.. and beyond that boundry = just simple artwork. Since you cannot interact with it, it usually stays still, and just looks like a wall with a painting, until you come close to it obviously. So I'll give it a 9/10 because.. the artwork is good + puts a little bit of realism to it. (Although I am watching a low quality version of it because I am using a low GPU PC)\\n\\n\r\nSound: The soundtracks are unique, and are amazing. We all know it. Need I say more? 10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: You get further character development later on.. I am told, but as we can tell from the way the characters act, we actually get a few character development over time, so far so good. This may change in the future but as of now 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10 simply because the idea is great.. the artwork and audio is amazing. The characters are going to be developed sooner or later and they do it gradually. The story is decent, it does confuse people but personally I think it's better but for the sake of others I set that to 7, because really.. the anime shouldn't require you to read the manga.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10.. because a 9 would be too high to give at the moment, and a 10 is only for masterpieces.\\n\\n\\n\r\n*This rating may change as the show progresses, since I do not know how it will end and how it will unfold, perhaps the anime will become a big disappointment because of budgeting.\\n\\n\r\n** Please PM me about anything else. If you need more clarification why I gave the rating and such, don't flame/troll or you will be ignored.\\n\\n\r\n*** This was my first review, please send me constructive criticism, even if it's about grammar/spelling.

            "content": "After a friend recommended this series to me, (plus the fact that it was readily available on netflix) I went ahead and gave it a shot.\r\nIn truth, SOA breaks my heart. \r\nAs plenty of people have said, the second season, if you want to call it that, is basically shit. \r\nIt's so poor that I'm not exactly sure how to describe the entire thing, but let's give it a try.  \r\n(Also, part of the reason that this may have spoilers is that the series itself is VERY predictable. Seriously. If the opening doesn't give it all way for you, I think you can tellthe plot from the very second, if not first, episode.)\\n\\n\r\nThe first 14 episodes were good. I'm not familiar with the MMO animes, I haven't seen .hack, but I enjoyed the premise. \\n\r\nThe setting is beautiful. It's why the Art gets a 9. Every panel is beautiful, the virtual word that the story takes place is so well fleshed out in beautiful colors and the art style is very good; The character designs are well done, and the animation is pretty decent as well. To go with the good art is the soundtrack, which is also top notch. The background music gets you riled up, even though the action scenes themselves aren't very intense, and the openings are catchy. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, you get to the problems. \\n\r\nThe story has its moments of brilliance. It IS too fast paced. Too many timeskips, too much filler-and given that the first arc is only 14 episodes, that time should have been spent better explaining the virtual world and how Kirito got half the power ups and met the people he did. Instead, the characters and their relations are rushed. What's funny to me is that the episodes that do the best are the ones that are meant to be stand alones, where there's only one character and their interaction with Kirito. I found the episodes with Silica and Lizbeth and their interactions with him (although every girl having a crush on him is extremely cliche and lousy) to be better developed than the romance with Asuna-which is especially weird because I actually like the main pair together. This is partly because the plot line focuses on them for the majority of the episode, while in later episodes, we're supposed to believe that they are in love and they're happy and they only want each other-but there's not really much proof of that. It's a lot of telling (though I guess showing as well, since it's TV) but not much feeling. \\n\r\nCombined with the rushed battle sequences, and the complete lack of suspense and surprise, you watch this show FOR the character interactions, not for the action. Kirito is made to win pretty easily, and there's never a moment where I thought that it was going to be hard, or where I was at the edge of my seat cheering him on but worried something bad was going to happen. \\n\\n\r\nAnd since this show IS about the relationship of the main two-I will say this. It was refreshing to have a couple that got together without any unnecessary beating around the bush or denying, so that it could move on. We get to see the scenes of a relationship after they get together, not just in the process, proving that there's a lot more to tell after a relationship starts and that the story doesn't end there. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Now I know this is a mixed bag. A lot of people HATE the main characters; call them gary stus and mary sues and who knows what else. \\n\r\nAnd I agree with a lot of people on this show and their reviews-but not this part. \\n\r\nTbh, when Kirito and Asuna were introduced-I liked them both respectively. \\n\r\nI found Kirito rather refreshing. Why? \\n\r\nBecause he still fulfilled the protagonist hero trope that's seen throughout shows and anime: strongest, saves the day etc. But I found him to be a lot more subtle than the usual Goku-esque MC. Not that there's anything wrong with that, because let's face it, e'eryone loves Goku. \\n\r\nYes, his flaws aren't too accentuated, and he doesn't have too many quirks, but I guess...he's...normal in that sense? More human? His personality isn't as much inconsistent as muted I would say. In real life people don't have too obvious glaring error traits, but multiple sides to their personality. I found Kirito to be likeable, subtle, and just a nice guy. \\n\r\nAsuna was likewise, a strong female lead, and although different sides of her character could be called \"inconsistent\" I think these were more faults on the story telling and pacing more than the characters themselves. If more time came to developing them and telling the time that happened \"offscreen\" it would be more helpful. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, all of the redeeming things that SAO had to offer goes to shit with the second storyline. \\n\r\nKirito becomes to the point where he IS bordering on Gary Stu, and is almost unlikable at times. There's a completely unnecessary romance triangle that is kind of gross, does absolutely nothing for the plot, and just leaves you questioning who's idea it even was. \\n\r\nThen there's the reduction of Asuna-who was second in command of the guild she was part of-to a damsel in distress, who on top of being in a cage crying and waiting for Kirito, is given no real role of action or to take charge of her situation, ON TOP of playing up gross tentacle molestation and sexual assault/attempted rape to further Kirito's man pain and provide as a plot device so that he can save her. \\n\r\nIt's gross, trashy and completely undermines her character. I can't comprehend how someone who created the women in the first 14 episodes, who yes, weren't without faults, could reduce them down to fetishized fanservice-which is what Asuna, and Sugu are. (And considering Sugu is a middle schooler, this is even worse.) \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I did enjoy the first part of the anime-there are many episodes I look at fondly, and that make me smile that have the potential to be rewatched. But after that point, it just gets stupider and stupider, and I'm almost embarrassed for the creators. \\n\r\nNo amount of pretty animation and good music can save the second half, which is why-as the warning I got from my friend in the very beginning-\\n\r\nDon't watch the second half, or you'll be left wanting to pretend it never exists.\\n\\n\r\nSidenote: I really loved the voice actors, even in the dub. So if shitty dub keeps you away, I have to say this one's is one of the better ones I've heard.\\n",

            "content": "Sword Art Online is a shounen action-romance that's got more in common with The Taming of the Shrew than it does with Romeo and Juliet.\r\nThe reason I bring Shakespeare's plays into this review at the very start is to firmly establish where SAO's biggest misstep lies. Romeo and Juliet is a play so influential that it's not only spawned a huge number of productions and adaptations (including one remarkably subversive anime series, which I wholeheartedly recommend), but it's also established the standard that the majority of romantic fiction ultimately aspires to: stories in which infatuated couples remain steadfast in the face of adversity (even ifthat steadfastness isn't evident in the play itself). It did this while simultaneously challenging the patriarchal zeitgeist of the Elizabethan period, depicting both of the titular protagonists as fully-fleshed out characters instead of the gendered archetypes that had pervaded fiction for millennia even by that point in time. See, now we're getting to it. The Taming of the Shrew is, in contrast, one of Shakespeare's more thematically contentious works, so much so that even its myriad of cinematic adaptations have presented some way to subvert or challenge the subtext that the original play enshrines. In short, it was a frank endorsement of misogyny and domestic abuse in which a fickle and often times rebellious young woman was \"tamed\" by a man who near-literally beats her independent spirit into submission. Yeah, Shakespeare wrote that.\\n\\n\r\nTo reiterate, Sword Art Online does more to advocate the misogynistic qualities of The Taming of the Shrew than it does the idealistic romanticism of Romeo and Juliet. I'm sorry if that sounds more than a little hysterical, but that's how it is, and it's a subtextual issue so glaring that not even the show's few shining moments can serve as an effective disguise.\\n\\n\r\nWhat really shields Sword Art Online's pre-modern sensibilities more than anything else is the seriously effective setup, which does a stunning job of painting a vivid and creative world that unfortunately ends up amounting to little more than a framework for bad character drama and near-nonsensical plot progression. And I'm not joking when I say that Sword Art Online's setup is SERIOUSLY effective! The context is well thought out and the design features on show are absolutely stunning right from the get-go. It has one of the best second episodes ever, and it follows that up by dealing out inventive and well-directed fight sequences and a few scenes of genuinely moving character drama. The characters all have appealing charisma, and lead female protagonist Asuna is established as being equal parts conscientious, wilful and conflicted. The foundations are there for one of the most compelling shounen anime that combines culturally-relevant context with strong action and dramatic romance, but unfortunately, Sword Art Online's way is to lay strong foundations and then build the rest of its structure up from loosely-packed mud.\\n\\n\r\nStanding at the forefront of this storytelling debacle is the kind of pandering misogynistic characterisation that storytellers were making efforts to move past centuries ago. Our protagonist, Kirigaya Kazuto (know in-game as Kirito), is a mid-teens gamer who begins the titular death game with a slight advantage over anyone else because he took part in the game's beta test. The fact that he's a dedicated gamers makes the intention here clear: this is evidently the character that the audience is meant to relate to, even if those characteristics really only allow for a superficial connection, and his immediate distinction from those around him (which continues as he becomes increasingly overpowered) serves as a portent to the show's attempts to imitate the kind of male-centric power fantasies that have entertained the insecure and done little else for countless years. Attempts are made to make him genuinely sympathetic through the act of establishing an arc focusing on his guilt at the death of close friends and his isolation from other players due to his nature as a \"Beater,\" but it never feels more than an arbitrary attempt to give him a personality that extends beyond just being effortlessly cool. Very little of it carries any real emotional weight, and you certainly won't find yourselves reflecting on the show's interpersonal conflicts once they've been and gone.\\n\\n\r\nKirito's one thing, but the real horror here rests in the depiction of the fairer sex: the girls. There's a scene in episode 1 of season 2 in which Kirito discusses his plans to pursue a career in the development of VR technology, to which romantic interest Asuna responds simply with the banal statement \"I want to stay with you forever.\" That basically sums it up. No female character has an existence that extends beyond being a romantic interest or secondary backup harem member to Kirito. This is made even worse by the fact that the show knowingly establishes motivations in nearly all of them. Asuna wants to lead the other players to victory. Yui wants to break free of the system and live a happy life with her adopted parents. Season 2's Sinon is given the most creative backstory yet (PTSD following a genuinely brutal personal trauma as a child), but even as I write this the show seems primed to shove those interesting internal conflicts aside in favour of reducing Sinon to another vapid love interest. All because that's just what SAO does. It takes any established personality trait in its female characters and hammers them flat until the characters themselves are fundamentally indistinguishable from one another.\\n\\n\r\nThey even have identical faces.\\n\\n\r\nSAO's second big issue is that Kawahara simply has no idea how to tie the events of the story together. That's right, rule-bending contrivances are the name of the game! Any tension that manifests throughout feels inconsequential simply because, no matter what, the writer will find a way to make things work out. This is painfully obvious, and it really reaches some totally ridiculous levels. Need the MC to solo a high-level monster? Have him manifest a unique skill from nowhere. Need the audience (or at least the less intuitive of the audience) to think that the two leads are dead? Add \"Power of Will\" rules that allow for temporary resurrections. The worst example comes near the end of the Fairy Dance Arc, when a character comes back to life from nowhere simply so that the big showdown can reach some kind of resolution, however blatantly contrived it may be. That's not good writing! Sword Art Online keeps tying its few good ideas together with contrived and often superfluous rubbish that fails to have any kind of dramatic impact. Kawahara-sensei, you can do better than this! I've seen Accel World. Yeah, it wasn't a game-changer, but that was actually a pretty good shounen!\\n\\n\r\nI don't think I need to keep going. Sword Art Online is bad. Not average, but straight-up bad. It enshrines the misogyny of The Taming of the Shrew while simultaneously putting on the face, Hannibal Lecter style, of Romeo and Juliet and a thousand other better action-romances. It's steeped in and derivative of the worst storytelling traditions, and despite being beautifully-framed and staged it does little to disguise the venomous subtext within. If you've not already seen it, continue to avoid it. If you have and you, like many others, genuinely feel that this series represents the epitome of fantasy fiction, I beg you to re-evaluate. We seriously can't let rubbish like this become the most commercially viable thing for producers to unleash upon a world where anime as a medium has the potential to do genuinely great things. Please, don't let it happen.",

And after watching it, i feel disatissfied and disappointed yet i understand why it is popular. \r\nThis show were made for younger audiences who happened to grow with mmorpgs and being less critical folks. So if you are the type of person who appreciate quality in a story; well written plot, good settings, personality and development in characters or even just looking for an anime to leave you a memorable impression, don't bother to watch this. \r\nBut ifyou are the type of person who could care less about things and watching only for entertainment purpose; fanservices, mmorpgs trend, invincible mc, then SAO will work fine for you. \\n\\n\r\nI've read a lot of worst manga than SAO (mostly shoujo), but this is the worst anime i've ever watched.. So far. Simply because the story is a mess and somehow it got animated. When people often complain if a story gets draggy, too long, or getting nowhere. SAO has crazy pacing, ignoring details, and anticlimactic final boss fighting. Plus, the second half of the show (Alfheim Online) should be made a separate story/sequel rather than part of 'Sword Art Online' story. \\n\r\nThus, with many things to complain I did enjoy watching it to a certain extent though.",

            "content": "First of all, I want to say that if you\u2019re an unconditional hater of Sword Art Online, don\u2019t read further please. I noticed that there are an important number of low rating reviews for this anime, so I think having another point of view would be great. Anyway don\u2019t get wrong, I\u2019m not writing this review to make the praise of SAO, I just want to share my feelings. Constructive criticisms are always welcome.\r\nSword Art Online is surely the anime which divides the most this year. But I think one thing brings people together in agreement, this anime had an amazing potential. Only by seeingthe first two episodes you\u2019ll see it. The plot is well introduced and really interesting. Having the consciousness trapped in a perfectly modeled virtual game, and with only one possibility to escape from that: finish the game, is quite captivating.\\n\r\nThen come the development of the story, when Sword Art Online definitively lost a part of the viewer. Why? To me, because some people didn\u2019t expect what the producers wanted to describe in the show: the feelings. Love, fear of death, friendship, treason\u2026. Yeah this show has a considerable part of describing feelings by scarificing some action scenes. And I don\u2019t think everybody was disappointed by that. Anyway, if you\u2019re going to watch this anime, have that in mind: you won\u2019t watch a show full of action, fighting scenes and hard trainings.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s talk about the action now, in one word: sloppy. Come on, fighting scenes against bosses, apart from episode 2, are like two minutes long, what\u2019s that? We just begin to appreciate the fight and it finish hurriedly. The fight with the suspense the most appreciable exactly takes 1min15, and it has at least 20sec of thiking of the protagonist. This isn\u2019t the strong part of the anime, you\u2019ll understand it. As the fights, the story is a little rushed. Kirito sometimes up 10 levels between two episodes, it personally didn\u2019t disappoint me, but I can understand that it can do, so it\u2019s important to say it.\\n\r\nFortunately, the romance catches up the anime in extremis, but not everyone agree with me I think, let\u2019s develop for people that plan to watch it. Yeah it has 5 \u2018loving\u2019 story in the 25 episodes (even if for me 2 of them are more a male-girl friendship), but only one is reciprocal. And it isn\u2019t a harem or something like. It seems to be a lot, but it really deserves the anime, and his purpose. Once again, it\u2019s possible that you disagree with me, but I just share what I think. \\n\\n\r\nSo if we\u2019re talking about relationship, let\u2019s have a look at the characters. The protagonist, named Kirito in the game, is firstly a reclusive person, who prefer stand and play alone. What is really great is that we will see how, in facing challenges and risking his life, he will grow up in mind. Firstly thinking that he is overpowered and super-skilled, he will become disillusioned, and will see that he is nothing but somebody fighting for his life, like everybody in the game. The meeting with Asuna will really change him. Asuna is another main character, a girl that wants to escape the faster possible this world. Why she is well made? Surely because she make the dream of any MMO players come true. A girl playing a massive multiplayer game, beautiful, and really skilled. \\n\r\nI can\u2019t really describe others characters since it will have more spoils than information. Moreover, some characters only appear in one episodes, but it once again deserve the anime, more precisely the setting here. We\u2019re in a game, so it\u2019s quite normal to meet somebody one day, and never see him again.\\n\\n\r\nFor the art & sound now, I\u2019m not an expert, so I just will say that it was not that bad. It\u2019s smooth, clear and detailed. The only thing I blame on the graphism is the character design, that could have been better, but it\u2019s just my point of view. For the sounds, I really really enjoyed the fighting theme. It fits so well that it\u2019s a shame to make all this work for only a 2 minutes fight. Openings and endings are really good, and even the lyrics are really well made for the anime, I mean it really represent what the show want to bring to the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nIn summary, Sword Art online is not as bad as a lot of reviewers say. It just follows its own path, surely different from what would be great to do for them. I\u2019m aware that this show has a considerable number of lacks, but what you should ask to yourself is: Am I watching shows for all the work put in it, or just to spend a nice time? To me, the enjoyment is the more important thing to rate a show. Once again, don\u2019t be outraged, it\u2019s just my point of view.\\n",

            "content": "By now I think every anime fan has heard about SAO and seen thousands of reviews for it but I still want to write my own version. It was actually one of the main reasons why I continued to watch this show. \r\nTo be honest, I have no idea where to begin...\r\nWell for starters, do you like the main cover? Looks fascinating does't it? Some interesting character designs too! Do you want to learn more about the characters? Really? Well then... FORGET IT!\r\nThe things is, this shows doesn't have characters. Especially in the first and main arc. The only characters we ever see are Kiritoand Asuna, the main due. However, despite being main characters we still know nothing about them until like second arc =/\\n\\n\r\nAre they interesting? Well they are not boring but I can't call them entertaining either. For one Asuna is your perfect wife and housewife. A type of woman any guy would like to have by his side. She is cheerful, beautiful and carrying. You will never get hungry for she is an amazing cook and your house will always be clean. She has every quality a dream woman should have and none that real woman does have. \\n\\n\r\nSame goes to Kirito. He is always friendly, kind, loving and strong. He never gets mad unless it is an enemy who threatens him and his friends. In a way he is same as Asuna. A dream man that any woman would like to have. He has all the positives of a dream man and no negatives of that real man. \\n\r\nThough he is not a very good cook... so I guess he is less perfect than Asuna.\\n\\n\r\nStory... oh boy, where do I even begin?\\n\r\nI'm sure everyone is familiar with the premises by now. Sounds exciting, doesn't it? I was beyond happy to start this series! Sadly the only good thing it had were premises, the real deal was horrendous! What could've become the best show ever, turned into a disaster full of lost potential! \\n\\n\r\nBefore anyone says anything, I'm talking purely about anime not novel. Never read it. It might be the best piece ever written but anime defiantly isn't. \\n\\n\r\nOne of it's major problems is a pacing. It is jumping between months like a bunny! I'm not saying that we should have 100 episodes to show every level, that would be boring. But to skip 50 levels in one episode? Isn't that a bit too much?\\n\\n\r\nFirst episode starts quiet nicely, then we have a whole month time skip in episode 2. Ok, I can tolerate that. But what about episode 3? At the beginning of the episode, series had skipped through another 2-3 months! But do you know what is the best part? By the end of the same episode it is already whole year! They skipped whole year in less than one episode! Do you realize how much material it is?!\\n\\n\r\nJust look at you own life! Just how much happens in just one year? How do people change? How do we change in one year?! Sometimes there can be drastic changes in a week! Yet here show simply skips through a very crucial time for players! They are stuck in this game where they could die any day because monsters are everywhere as well as dark characters. It's a panic time! Even if not panic, it is a massive change of life for characters where they go through a lot not just physically but also emotionally. However, show decided that it is not import and skips this whole thing straight to the point where characters already accepted their fate and live normally. It's like if author/creators had no idea how to explore human mind as well as develop them and decided to simply skip to the easiest part of the story.\\n\\n\r\nThat's actually not the only time they did it. It happens in almost every episode. It felt more like episodic show!\\n\r\nThis pacing also effected character development. Let's take Kirito for example. In episode 1 and 2 he is the biggest coward  and then in a flash he is the bravest man on a planet. In episode 3 something major happens that turns Kirito into emo. However, in episode 4 he is all fine and happy. Why? Because another several months passed! Of course he would be fine! But does it really sit well with you? Once again it feels like if creators had no idea how to deal with Kirito's moodiness as well as how to solve it so they just skipped saying \"Time heals everything!\". They simply needed  something dramatic to happen to drive MC forward. They just created an excuse for him to change. They did not develop Kirito, they just conveniently changed him to benefit their other future idea. That's called lazy writing.\\n\\n\r\nAnother issue concerning characters... in one of the later episode Asuna tells her sob story about how she was crying all the time but then came Kirito her light! Do you know what is the problem here? SAO breaks one of the main rules of story telling \"Show, not tell.\" SAO does everything other way around. It is very hard to feel sorry for Asuna when in every single episode she was shown as a happy, strong character. None of the issues she said were ever shown or hinted at. Creators simply felt like she needed a sob story. If she was a side character, ok fine. But she is a freaking main heroine! You don't just skip things like that!\\n\\n\r\nTalking about characters... every side character appears maximum for like 25min, basically just for one episode. You are lucky to see them at least for another few seconds later on. Most of the characters are already good friends with Kirito and forgave him everything. None of the issues were ever addressed. \\n\\n\r\nAlso it is a game, their real bodies are still out there and need treatment... where do they get it? How did they function for the last 2 years?! This question got answered only at the end of the arc when no one already cares. Bodies are taken to the hospital and looks like during that time characters had fallen asleep. One again we were told not shown. Show once again didn't bother to show us that abnormality. Don't you think it is important? Characters suddenly falling asleep? That's major! It could leave so much for speculation too! But no! \\n\\n\r\nIn all honesty it feels more like normal fantasy setting where characters have lived their whole life not like a death game where random people/gamers got stuck.\\n\\n\r\nDeaths are pretty flashy and sometimes it is hard to take them seriously. Maybe it is my own opinion but I believe that series would have been so much better if we actually got to see what is happening in real life. What happens to the bodies? How are families dealing with it? How is government dealing with it? Did they just leave 10 000 people be?!\\n\\n\r\nKirito is the biggest lady magnet too. To make it worse every single female out there is probably a lock in who spent her whole life watching romance movies. \\n\r\nFemales like that do exist, but every single one of them? Really?\\n\\n\r\nThis show has lost so much potential it is not even funny!\\n\r\nI have so much more to say but I'll stop and will address it's second arc now.\\n\\n\\n\r\nARC 2\\n\r\nUnlike many others, I actually enjoyed this arc far more and for me it was a saving point for this series. \\n\r\nStory wise it was bad and quiet un-original. However, what made this arc better is the fact that we finally have a linear story and you do't feel like you have skipped something. Another plus is the fact that we finally have more actual characters! They still need more depth but in comparison to SAO arc they already have 10 time more presence. We also get to see what is happening in real world. Not much but better than nothing. We see how real bodies look and learn about consequences. \\n\\n\r\nOn it's own this arc was useless especially since main theme was a typical Dam in distress arc. Also players are taking game way too seriously. they make great speeches about sacrificing themselves, cry when someone dies and... what's the point? In few seconds the same characters comes back like nothing happened... it is not SAO arc! Scenes like this should be done there not here!\\n\\n\r\nAlso who said that SAO is very original? I lost count on how many unoriginal ideas it has:\\n\r\na) Deus Ex Machina, Kirito just loves it! To be frank, he is the most over powered character there even thought it is a game where everyone can upgrade. \\n\r\nb) Unrequited cousin love, it is almost in every anime now.\\n\r\nAnd so much more! But those are the most glaring ones. \\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, if creators had combined two arcs, we could actually get a decent show. SAO would finally have a linear story with actual characters and development but like that it was just meh...\\n\\n\r\nAbout good parts... well animation and character designs are beautiful. I would love to see one of those worlds so I have no complaints here. It also has some awesome soundtracks. \\n\\n\r\nDespite it's flaws SAO still had some nice and memorable moments that I liked but sadly there are too many minuses. I didn't even list half of them...\\n\\n\r\nSorry guys but I find this show average. It had some good ideas but with horrible execution. Also a lot of bad and over used ideas, some of the topics were never ever really dealt with like for example dark killer guilds.\\n\\n\r\nI can tolerate 8 and 7 marks but I totally can't accept 9 and 10 especially when people themselves admit that show has flows and that novel did this or that better. \\n\\n\r\nBefore you SAO fans will start to scream at me, shouting \"Fuck you, SAO still has high rating.\" let me ask you one thing... do you know why?\\n\r\nThink about it... how many so called haters have given this show 1 or 2? I'm for most part hater but I tried to be reasonable and gave it 5. Imagine that all of us were to lower our marks to 1 and 2... How big will be this difference?\\n\\n\r\nIt will fall, I guarantee you that. So before calling us names think, it is thanks to us that this show is holding the high score, not only you.\\n\\n\r\nBesides shows have to be criticized otherwise we would have thousands of works with perfect mark and then no one could call fanfics bad.\\n\\n\r\nNow to those who still didn't watch the show... you heard my opinion, it is a waste. Will it be a waste for you? Don't know.\\n\r\nI addressed some of its main issues, if you believe you can handle them then sure watch it. If no, stay away.\\n\\n\r\nThe way I would summarize SAO, especially arc 1 would be a children show because of how simple it's structure and development is. \\n\\n\r\nThat's all I have to say for now.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for your time, buy!",

            "content": "I've never actually written a review before. I thought that I should go with a series that I don't like.\r\nYou already know the plot. The first episode seemed promising. The plot was interesting enough. The second episode however, skipped forward a month. (I can't remember how far it skipped ahead, let's just say a month.) We do not see the bland, generic main guy \"Kirito\" progress in skills, instead we see that he is already a \"supa cool awesome\" fighter that is better than everyone else playing the game. At this point, do we feel any connection to him whatsoever? Nope. We can't relate tohis struggles, simply because he doesn't seem to have any. \\n\\n\r\nIn the second episode, the apparent main heroine Asuna appears. She and Kirito face off against the first boss and, surprise surprise, kill it with their \"awesum powers\". After that, we see Kirito go through a short change in personality, where he becomes more egotistical and brags about his ability. However, this change lasts all of 30 seconds, and he quickly reverts to his bland self, probably because any kind of personality whatsoever would make him less of a generic anime protagonist. \\n\\n\r\nFollowing this episode, we see some episodes that dont develop the plot any further. The basic premises of these episodes is \"Kirito meets girl, helps her, girl develops feelings 4 kirito\". That's basically it. One of the episodes, which I guess was supposed to make us sad, contains Kirito befriending a group of players, who ultimately, all die. This would of been a sad side story, if it had lasted for more than 1 episode. Had we of known these characters for more than 10 minutes, maybe we could of felt a connection to them. Once again, we fail to be able to relate to Kirito, seeing as none of us have made friends for like a day and then watch them all die. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the first season basically consists of Kirito and Asuna forming a bland, generic relationship, despite having zero chemistry, and having hardly any screentime together. We have no idea what they see in eachother, or why they like eachother at all. They barely spend time together until they kiss for some reason. One episode after that, they have sex and decide to get married. \\n\\n\r\nThe series ends rather abruptly in my opinion, with a terrible ending. Both of the two main characters die, but for some reason Kirito comes back to life with no explanation whatsoever and kills the final boss. We then see him awake in a hospital room, where he immediantly gets up from the bed and goes to find Asuna.\\n\\n\r\nThe series could of been semi-decent if they had ended there. But no, there's more.\\n\r\nThe second season revolves around Kirito and his bland, uninteresting sister playing THE EXACT SAME GAME as sword art online, but with fairies. Apparently, Asuna has not woken up from playing sword art online, and tearfully, Kirito plays the dumbass fairy game to find his beloved waifu. He then meets the extremely busty and bland \"Leafa\", who teaches him how to fly. UNSURPRISINGLY, Kirito quickly masters the game. Leafa quickly develops romantic feelings towards Kirito, despite only knowing him for like 3 days.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Sword Art Online was an overall dreadful experience. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 3/10\\n\r\nI liked the premise, but it was not executed very well.\\n\r\nArt: 5/10\\n\r\nThe art was ok, albeit quite bland and uninteresting\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nAlthough decent, the music was not memorable in any way \\n\r\nCharacter: 1/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4/10\\n\r\nAlthough I disliked the series greatly, It was relatively entertaining\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2/10",

If you've ever read \"Heir Apparent\", you'll know what this show is like (though there are obvious differences).\r\nWell, let's get on with the review. \r\nThe story get's a 6/10 from me. It's filled with cliches and goes way too fast (Yes, I know of the time constraint they have and such, though the show doesn't pay the LN justice). It's an interesting concept with the idea of a Death MMO kind of thing, but I never liked how everyonedidn't ask many questions and hopped on the bandwagon, and how there isn't very much interference form the real world. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound are both 8/10s for me. It's good, goes well with the mood and theme of the places, and overall looks and sounds great.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters get a 6/10. Main characters are supposed to be somewhat relatable and likable, and I can't see very many things in Kirito that I can like about him, and the other characters are easily forgettable and come in and out of the show. Nonetheless, there still is tons of time for character improvement, but first impressions are the MOST IMPORTANT things in an anime/game/show/book, etc, even more so important that some of the endings. If things about characters aren't captivating in the beginning, it's a skip for me.\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment is 7/10 for me and overall, a 6/10. It's a fair show, but meh, there are lots better.",
