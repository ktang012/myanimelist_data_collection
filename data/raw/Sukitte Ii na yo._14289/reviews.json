            "content": "Oh how I wanted to say, I love you to Sukitte Ii na yo...  but I just can\u2019t because you\u2019re a flat two dimensional romance that just didn\u2019t live up to my expectations.  It really is a shame, because Suki na yo had a tremendous amount of potential and gave us some things we don\u2019t often get to see in the romance genre.  But as the series winds down I found myself lamenting what could have been.\r\nIt\u2019s hard for me to be too hard on the romance anime plot premise, I mean they have pretty much already all been done before andthey are all mostly silly as well.  Suki na yo is no different, with the unlikely story of the hot and most popular guy in school falling for a shy, friendless loner who kicked him down the stairs because she mistakenly thought he flipped her skirt.  The beginnings of true and lasting love if I ever saw it.  The girl Mei, and the boy Yamato, both have some interesting personality issues on the surface and despite the silliness of their meeting there was some enormous amount of potential in their relationship.  However this is sadly mostly wasted over the course of the story.\\n\\n\r\nNow here is where Suki na yo is a bit different from its other romance cousins.  For the most part our lead characters are in a relationship together from the beginning to the end of the series.  The typical format is 99% courting with the eventual payoff at the end when our little lovebirds finally realize their mutual affections.  While it can often be frustrating when it is drug out with silly misunderstandings and character cockblocks at least by then we have a clear understanding why they both love each other. The show is called Say I love you, but it should probably more aptly called Say why I love you.   \\n\\n\r\nEven though I have some pretty serious complaints about the way the shows romance and plot unfolds, I can\u2019t say I didn\u2019t enjoy watching this series.  But when you compare it with its peers within the genre and even shows that were airing during the same time as this, it comes across as distinctly average and ordinary.\\n\\n\r\nMuch in the same way as the story is underwhelming, so are the series main characters.  A romance is by nature very character driven and if we don\u2019t get compelling leads it\u2019s pretty difficult to care if they end up falling in love with each other.  Mei is your standard \"everyman\" kind of girl typical in shoujo romances.  She\u2019s cute, though not particularly beautiful, and pretty much average in every other way.  She\u2019s a nice girl with a strong spirit but very vulnerable as well.  Exactly the kind of girl most people can relate too and can root for as well.  It\u2019s sweet how she slowly comes out of her shell and makes friends and learns to trust people again as well.  Even though this mostly comes across pretty corny and clich\u00e9d.  Though hell I like corny and clich\u00e9d anyway.\\n\\n\r\nYamato is less interesting and in many ways is also your typical bishounen leading man.  Though I will give him some credit for breaking the trend and not being a cold, aloof, and unfeeling jerk.  You get the feeling most of the time he has genuine feelings for Mei but at other times he\u2019s actions around her seemed to be a bit condescending and they he was treating her more like a pet and as an equal partner.  I felt some aspects of his personality were also very inconsistent, especially later in the series.  For a guy who came across as supremely confident he was surprisingly weak willed at times and his distrust of Mei's feelings at times was implausible considering what the pair had been through to that point already.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast is the weakest link though and stereotypical shoujo fair.  This plays in to the weakness of the plot but basically the same themes are repeated multiple times over the course of the story.  Girl appears, of course hopefully in love with Yamato, drama unfolds, girl is rejected and our leads love continues.  And the rejected gets new love and becomes best friends with our dear Mei.  While I mostly liked the supporting characters they simply lack the depth for them to be actually interesting.  Then of course you have to look past the unlikelihood that two romantic rivals are going to be besties afterwards, particularly when one side was involved in some pretty nasty schemes and bullying.\\n\\n\r\nDespite all these flaws though what Suki na yo really does best is both its artwork and musical soundtrack.  Both are typical of the genre but I really did love both of the songs.  The seiyuu cast is comprised of mostly veterans but none of them are real stars.  I thought they did solid, if unspectacular work.  While the artwork may not be a masterwork, it is very fluid and reality based, with clothes and body types that stay in the realm of possibility.\\n\\n\r\nEven though in the end I have quite a few complaints about Suki na yo, it\u2019s still a good watch.  If you\u2019re really starved, as I was, for a romance anime with a sweet ending and are not demanding to be shown some that\u2019s never been seen before then you should have a good time with it as well.\\n",

            "content": "I've sat and tried to figure out what is so special about this anime. It really doesn't bring anything new to the table. You have your awkward girl, the hot guy who seems to like her, and some competition for his affections. Pretty standard formula. \r\nHowever, this anime actually accomplishes it WELL. Where it stands out is how dead on and absolutely accurate it depicts falling in love HARD the first time. Even if you've been in love several times, you'll find something in Mei and Yamato's relationship that may bring tear to your eye. \r\nMei is a good character. Several female leads in thissort of role invariably fall into the \"Mary-Sue\" trap and end up just being an empty shell. What makes Mei stand out is the decisions she makes and how she reacts to the situations around her. Throughout watching all the episodes, I watched Mei make the same decisions I would of as a girl in her position in high school. She is realistic and very easy to sympathize with. \\n\\n\r\nYamato's character could have easily suffered from the same sort of stigma that befalls his character archetype. The typical, popular, good-looking guy. This could have easily turned into a 13 episode version of the movie \"She's All That\" but his character keeps it from doing so. Yamato actually comes off like he has an absolutely beautiful soul. He strikes you as that rare individual that is good inside and out and instead of \"making over\" the heroine in his popular image he seems like he was looking for someone like her all along. Then he works to get others to see she's actually a good person the way she is. \\n\\n\r\nTheir budding relationship is realistic as well, save for the part with Yamato's little sister. That part came out of left field but I digress. Watching them learn from each other and grow is entertaining and you want nothing more than to root for their happiness while watching. The show leaves you with warm fuzzy feelings inside that stick around for a while. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is gorgeous and the music complements it perfectly. The intro took me a bit to get used to but once I did I found it very cute. Overall, even if you're the type to shun the typical \"romance, shoujo, slice of life\" anime - PLEASE try his one. It's worth it.",

            "content": "Sukitte Ii na yo is a gem. I mean it as a gem that sparkles, shines, and is one of those rare classic shoujo that is pleasing to audience who are into the drama medium. The series is quite something to take an insight on because of the way it presents itself. Let's think of it this way and picture yourself in the story:\r\nYou're an individual who has a troubled past. You have been ostracized by various circumstances and nowadays, you don't give a damn what anyone thinks about you or your life. That is till you meet one of the hottest student at schoolwho takes an interest in you. Your heart pounds and for the first time in your life, you give a damn about your life and those around you especially regarding that student. That, my friends, is where Sukitte Ii na yo shines. It's a discovery and it's a classic.\\n\\n\r\nSukitte Ii na yo (also known as Say \"I Love You\".) is an anime series adapted from the manga written by Kanae Hazuki. The animation studio, Zexcs handles its production which is already known for some of its past works in the romance department such as Da Capo, Fortune Arterial, and H2O: Footprints in the Sand. The series fits within the romance and drama side as opposed to a pure romantic comedy because of the story involved. \\n\\n\r\nLike I mentioned before, the series is a classic for those into the shoujo medium. It is like a breath of fresh air to watch especially with the lighthearted backgrounds presented. For those into some school drama involving the typical high school life, it's like a journey all over again. \\n\\n\r\nThe series kicks off with a girl named Mei Tachibana. She is nothing special although she used to get well along with others. Unfortunately, it seems that events in the past has shut her down and made her an unsociable person. In fact, classmates who knows her describes Mei as a girl who keeps to herself with little words and a person stuck in her own little world. Yet at the same time, we can see Mei as an honest girl who is caring, loyal, and willing to help others when the time calls for it. But time isn't always on her side especially during a day when she bumps heads to heads with the most popular student at school. \\n\\n\r\nHere's where the drama kicks in and his name is Yamato Kurosawa.\\n\\n\r\nYamato is one of the most popular guys at school and his name may even suggest a male version of Yamato Nadeshiko (no pun intended). He meets Mei in a very unusual way at school and later on so helps her with a problem involving a stalker. Yikes! Now, from there on and out, the two forms a bond despite Mei's stubbornness. \\n\\n\r\nNow, the duo seems to very incompatible at first glance. I mean, Mei is one of the most plain looking girls at school with a plain way of dealing with her life. On the other hand, Yamato is the most popular guy at school who is idolized by many of the students. Sounds like living on the opposite of the world, right? Yet, what these two individuals share in common is their willingness to take on life itself with their ways of helping others and discover themselves. It's a pleasant watch and a rare gem we don't see too common in today's shoujo theme series. Later on, Mei and Yamato forges a relationship that seems to get quite the attention. \\n\\n\r\nI honestly think the duo are quite compatible that balances out each other. We know that Mei is a plain looking girl who is clumsy yet very honest with herself and with others. Yamato often goes out helping his classmates as well by putting others above himself. We can see that he dislikes people who just likes him for his appearance. When Yamato realizes that Mei likes him beyond just his physical appearance, the two becomes quite compatible. Although loathed by some of the other students at school, they are a good match. \\n\\n\r\nThe other characters also plays their roles in the story as well that often brings forth new surprises and obstacles to the couple. That brings for the drama into the series. \\n\\n\r\nOn the male side, we have Kai Takemura who has very similar circumstances with Mei. Both of them had a past they wish they can forget but they manage to move on. After their encounter, Kai becomes part of the love triangle between Yamato, Mei, and himself. It's drama to the D especially when we see Yamato's jealous and defensive side. On the female side, there is Megumi Kitagawa. She is seen as an idol on similar status with Yamato and is possibly what Mei wants to be: popular and beautiful. Yet, we see behind that outer shell is a very insecure girl who seems sweet but is only aiming at her own goals, aka Yamato. The three of them is a love triangle that makes Mei once again examine herself and the relationship she forms.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall execution of the series follows that typical shoujo theme ways of portraying its ways, settings, and backgrounds. As such, expect some cliched and predictable moments especially between the duo of Mei and Yamato. Even from the pilot episode, it can be easy to tell where the direction the two are heading. The misunderstandings and some of the drama are also easy to see through especially involving Megumi. It's no surprising either that in high school, all sort of situations happen and love is may just be one of them. The series takes that love between the duo and drives it throughout each episode as obstacles and events are presented. It shows how much they discover themselves and how much they can change when they understand each other.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork of the series is quite realistic and portrays the backgrounds with the school life setting. The various classrooms, playgrounds, and characters are real and needs to be in that way to convey to the viewers what high school is all about. Yuka Hirama (the art director) does a wonderful job of that crafting the characters. Mei is painted as a plain looking girl. Yamato is painted as cool looking guy. Megumi is painted as a school idol with a beautiful figure. Kei is painted as a guy that used to have a rebellious nature. It is all there and the audience can see how each of them fits within their boundaries within the artwork department.\\n\\n\r\nSimilarly, the soundtrack of the series is lighthearted. Although not too well known, Yuuji Nomi engineers the series' music with his skills to create a sense of being there. It's nothing too special because it mostly is lighthearted and hardly noticeable at times. However, it is a sweet melody that depicts the settings and the characters especially the opening song. \"Friendship ~ for Sukitte Ii na yo\" by Ritsuko Okazaki is a very lighthearted song that gives off that melody of sweetness which depicts the duo's sweet relationship. Similarly, the ED song follows the same suit to match the lightheartedness of the series.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Sukitte Ii na yo is a pleasant series to watch. The relationship between Mei and Yamato is quite warming and realistic to what some of us may have experienced during our teen years. It's heartwarming, sweet, and at the same time has drama to it especially involving the other characters. It is also a shoujo that fits within its boundaries without going over heels or trying too hard. Ultimately, it's a rare  little gem that deserves praise for its beauty.",

            "content": "Sukitte Ii na yo was my first romance anime to watch and I decided to write this review in order to convey to you all of my thoughts about it. Well, when I was watching the earliest episodes, I thought it was really underrated. There are many out there that don\u2019t really like it (and I\u2019m talking about girls certainly) and that was always leads it to be given really unfair ratings.\r\nWell that\u2019s exactly the problem with romance animes. Their stories redound to become mainstream and that\u2019s why they don\u2019t appeal much on their viewers, so that makes them complete them without considerate them asa big deal. But here we have something special. A HUGE deal, actually lol. \\n\r\nSo, let\u2019s start from the basics.\\n\\n\r\nWe have our typical social-awkward girl and the popular hot guy who falls in love with her. Of course I was like \u201cawww\u201d when hearing the typical love words and stuff like \u201cyou\u2019re my everything\u201d, but what I liked more was the participation of the other characters in the story. I mean, watching a couple doing stuff all over the anime is totally boring. But here, you will see development in the characters. They will narrate their different pasts, their different stories and reveal sad truths and facts about them. So, there were some life lessons as well. Trying hard to be accepted by the others -so much that you harm yourself, overcoming your fears, the meaning of friendship, be envy of the others, isolate yourself. All these applied on the characters making you enjoy the show as you see how relations between them are being developed. And I think that was actually what made me curious about the next episode, watching it right after the previous \u2018cause I just couldn\u2019t wait at all :P What I also liked was the way that characters showed up in the show, leaving you more curious and making you wanting to \u201cexplore\u201d their personalities and find out their connection to the rest of the characters, as well (which was an another strong point of the anime).\\n\\n\r\nSo, about the \u201cromantic\u201d side, I have to say that I really liked it. You can clearly see what love really means, what love really is just by how the relation between the two main characters is developed. And this anime taught me that love has to do with completing and dedicating completely to each other. Hahah, and I\u2019m putting aside the cute main character, our loving Yamato. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nSukitte Ii na Yo was a decent romance anime. Not too girly nor boring and totally NOT stupid at all. It can keep you stuck to it until the end through its great love story, the shapely art, the variety of the characters and the zestful relations/connections between them.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Say 'I Love You.'\r\nWhere do I even start with this anime. The title even gives off an exceedingly romantic, unrealistic atmosphere. If there was ever a competition for \"The Most Generic Shoujo,\" Say 'I Love You' would take the cake. \r\nLet's start off with a brief summarization. A reserved young girl who has no social connection whatsoever plays as the object of desire for the most popular, handsome boy in the school. They eventually establish an awkward relationship filled with uncomfortable dialogue and well, there you have it. There really isn't much else to say about this anime. It's simplistic, it doesn't try to breakany boundaries, and it's so monotonous it will probably make you yawn and fall asleep. It executed what every romantic comedy anime out there has ever attempted to accomplish. I can guarantee that you have seen this same template numerous times before, and I can also promise that you have seen better. \\n\\n\r\nStory - 4 / 10 \\n\\n\r\nThe story is generic and monotonous. It does not bring anything new to the table that makes itself memorable, or leave a mark behind in history. You can summarize the story in one sentence, and the reader could predict everything that will ever happen in the anime. Is there any completely unexpected plot twist? Is there any cliffhanger that leaves you at the edge of your seat? Or maybe there is some sort of symbolism, or undertone that it is trying to portray. The answer is 'no' to all of your questions. The story is basically a silly, happy-go-lucky, simplistic romance that has been repeated too many times before with absolutely no depth whatsoever. The pacing also made me uncomfortable. First episode they meet, second they kiss, and third, they automatically become a boyfriend and girlfriend. It's immature and childish, and definitely does not represent the singular theme they have been emphasizing throughout this entire anime, which is indeed 'love.' The storyline was just another contribution to why I find Say 'I Love You' so bland. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 5 / 10 \\n\\n\r\nThe art is satisfactory. It doesn't do anything extraordinary, but it certainly isn't disgusting. The somewhat likable character design, and the brightening colors that were incorporated into the background scenery was what gave its' animation a semi-respectable score, and I am sorry to say, is the pinnacle of this anime's accomplishment. Other than the sparkle and the twinkle that they sprinkle and sugarcoat in every single shoujo anime, Say 'I Love You' does not outdo any other anime with its' art. To wrap it up, it does its' job, and with the wide variety of spectrum the animation studio ventures into when they bring this anime to life is a compliment I am reluctant to give, but I will just for the anime's mentionable work. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 4 / 10 \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of Say 'I Love You' is almost like a lullaby. It puts you into a slumber, and makes you wonder whether Say 'I Love You' is supposed to make you fall asleep or make you giggle and laugh over the chemistry experienced throughout adolescence. The opening theme is a heartwarming hymn, but certainly isn't anything special. It's calm, collected, but definitely doesn't introduce the romantic aspect of Say 'I Love You', but gives you a more wistfully composed orchestral piece. The quiet piano and violin strumming away in the background is soothing and gentle, but it just didn't break a barrier or kick down a wall for me. The ending theme is practically an identical twin to its' opening theme counterpart. The OST? More whimsical singing, making me picture it to be more of a children nursery rhyme than a love song. In conclusion, the sound? Nothing remarkable. But still bearable. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 3 / 10 \\n\\n\r\nThe characterization throughout Say 'I Love You' is most likely the worst part of this anime. The main female protagonist is timid, reserved Mei Tachibana. Her introduction actually somewhat drew me in-- an anti-social, pessimistic student who doesn't believe in establishing relationships with her classmates. This really hooked me-- I wanted to know more about her perspective on the everyday boundaries of school life, and her thoughts/opinions on social hierarchy, interactions, etc. I also really liked it when I noticed the courage she possessed when she gave the most popular boy at her school a roundhouse kick in the face! But then this bright, intelligent, and audacious young woman that I believed had such an interesting view on the world suddenly transformed into your ordinary tsundere character who would never respond to the male protagonist, Yamato Kurosawa's affection. Which brings me to my next point. Yamato Kurosawa has got to be one of my least favorite characters in Say 'I Love You.\" He is perfect, almost robotically so. Yamato Kurosawa, the academic all star, the athletic champion, the wealthy son of a successful family, and on top of all that he has a beautiful face and a social life. Which is what makes him so monotonous to observe as a character. I didn't like how there wasn't anything wrong with him. He is a human, not an alienish demigod who excels at everything he does. I also didn't like the sudden fluctuation between his interest in Mei. First he is all over her, his top priority, the one individual he wanted to see and spend his time with, and then all of a sudden, he almost forgets her. The process rinses and repeats like a cycle. Neither Mei Tachibana nor Yamato Kurosawa did their role as the main protagonist justice, not even decently so, which is why the score they have received is so long. It would have been even lower if Mei Tachibana's introduction wasn't so solid. This aspect of Say 'I Love You' was yet another factor that made this anime so disappointing. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 3 / 10 \\n\\n\r\nAlright, I will admit it. I don't usually watch shoujo anime. Yes, I have seen a lot of excellent shoujo anime, and I have seen a lot of completely gagworthy shoujo anime. Say 'I Love You' to me is just a mediocre, soap opera fling. It is a decent anime to watch if you want to completely turn off your constructively critical brain, and just enjoy a romantic comedy. But that does not forgive the English bran muffin of a storyline, and the disastrous characterization. Say 'I Love You' has done everything that has already been done, and if not worse. I certainly did NOT enjoy this anime, and this is coming from a female adolescent, which I believe is Say 'I Love You' 's target demographic. It claims itself to be a romantic comedy slice-of-life. But I did find the relationship that Mei and Yamato shared to be romantic, but more awkward, prepubescent, and coming-of-age. The most that Mei and Yamato did was hold themselves in an uncomfortable embrace, or a sudden kiss here or there. In my opinion, an adolescent attraction is not what love is, and if you haven't noticed already from its' title, is what this anime is trying so hard to emphasize. It claims itself to possess comedy, and will promise laughter. But the jokes that were displayed only put a halfhearted smile on my face, because well, I can't put it anymore bluntly than it wasn't funny, and definitely didn't provide any entertainment for me as the audience. It does what it's supposed to with its' slice of life genre, which isn't all too interesting to witness anyway. You have your high school, identical uniforms, and handsome/beautiful boys and girls. Nothing ever happened, nothing ever happens, and nothing ever will happen. Say 'I Love You' just wasn't for me. \\n\\n\r\nAnd with that, I give it an overall score of 4 / 10. \\n\r\nSorry. :/ \\n",

Is your appearance really all that matters?\r\nThis anime brings a serious problem to our attention in a modern way taking a quite complicated school life as an example. Not becoming an outsider or being bullied means being nice to everybody, wearing designer clothes, accessories, make-up, as well as keeping your mouth shut, when someone gets hurt. So much effort to survive in school.\r\nDo I really need to be like everybody else?\r\nIt\u2019s difficult to be an individual in this school. Having fake friends is better than having none, you would think. None of us likes to be betrayed, but atthe same time you cannot rely on yourself only. Some might prefer not having friends like that, others cannot understand it at all. I can quite correspond to the main character\u2019s choice. Opening up after being hurt is always difficult.\\n\\n\r\nWhy did the best looking guy at school choose this particular girl? Why not me, when I sacrificed everything to look that great now?\\n\r\nExpectations. It may be painful, but love at a first sight is possible, which most of the people do not understand. Its above all these things like looks, money or having many friends. It saddens me, that because of a peer pressure at school some of the students fight over boys or girls, just to have sex with her/ him. And having sex with someone popular or handsome at school means I will become popular too. \\n\\n\r\nAt some point, many do not understand or will never experience what is like to be loved, so why not try and ruin other people\u2019s luck? Will our first love and relationship overcome all these obstacles? Am I strong enough to cope with all that? I am impatiently waiting for another episode to find out.\\n",

This is all my own opinion, and if you don't agree with it, then that's okay too. We are all entitled to our opinions.\r\nSukitte Ii na yo (Say \"I Love You\") was an anime I knowingly walked into as the new love story of the year.  Except it surprised me, in the best way possible.  The story seemed to rush into the love story at the beginning, I didn't really expect anything more than that.Except the story took a new twist.\\n\\n\r\nThe story took a deeper path, by looking at the background of almost every character, the things that had happened to them.  Basically their dark secrets.  For each one it was either being a bully, or being bullied.  The story turned from this silly love story, into watching people overcome fears, battle their pasts, and learn to trust others.\\n\\n\r\nIf there was one thing I took out of this anime, it was this:\\n\\n\r\nEveryone has a story to tell.  And the way people act now, is because of something in their past.  And if you never learn about that past, then you don't know the real them.\\n\\n\r\nA quote from the anime:\\n\\n\r\n\"But there's nothing wrong to worrying. It's like a wall you need to overcome, to make it to the next level. If you're running up against that wall, it means you're moving forward. I wonder how many walls I've broken up until now, but if you wont move yourself, you will never get anywhere.\"\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this anime to anyone.",

            "content": "Sukitte ii na yo (eng. Say \u201dI love you\u201d) had potential to be a blissful romantic drama - for the most part, it is. It nails many aspects of a good story which make up for its flawed plot. The best part of this show is the cast of characters: they are solid, varied and interesting. All of them have their upsides, downsides, flaws and rivalries.\r\nEven without an external plot, the emotional plot alone carries this show far. The animation is really sick too: The lines are sharp and everything from backgrounds to people is finely detailed. Both the guys and the girls are attractiveto the eye but not overtly sexy. I can't emphasize enough how much I liked the art \u2013 oh, and the music! Both the intro and the end theme are amazing and I loved hearing them every time.\\n\\n\r\nThe only problem with this show is its lack of a plot. Especially unnerving is how watered down the love triangles are. Every crisis is resolved way too easily, some of them almost instantly and without any actual developments. The good thing is, by the time you start feeling disappointed, you've already reached the ending. The strong points for this series are the characters who have tons of personality and historic background.\\n\\n\r\nThe show deals with plenty of social themes, mostly focused on the brutal side of social life, such as bullying, eating disorders, self-esteem issues, etc. These themes could've used far more in-depth exploration. I have not read the manga, but I get the feeling like most of my problems with this series are related to the hiccups which materialize when you adapt hundreds of pages of manga into 20-minute episodes.\\n\\n\r\nI love romantic fiction, but I also have a very personal beef with it. I know there are young people out there who build their ideas about relationships from fiction. The story of Romeo and Juliet is the perfect example of how retarded and self-destructive young love can be. I'm not saying people can't enjoy fantasies, but they need to recognize pandering bullshit. \"Sukitte ii na yo\" is smart because it avoids one of the grave sins of romantic fiction: Instead of falsely implying that lack of social skills makes you hot, the story actually digs into the theme of disparity in social stature and its effect on a relationship. The author clearly has an idea what she's doing and it\u00b4s too bad the story doesn't reach the heights it could have.\\n\\n\r\nI really hope that some day there will be a second season for \"Sukitte ii na yo\", because I definitely feel thirsty for more.",

            "content": "\"Having friends is the same as setting yourself up for a fall.\" - Someone probably.\r\nSukitte Ii na yo or Say \"I Love You.\" is an anime mainly about trying to manage a relationship with THE most popular dude in high school with you being the unpopular 'emo' girl, while at the same time is about making and sometimes find out what a true friend is. Now people have told me that, to be blunt, my reviews are sometimes a bit shit so I'm going to try a different formula and see how that goes.\r\nTHE GOOD: \r\nThe characters in this anime are great, and you reallyneed them to be because, this is a high school romance anime, if the characters are uninteresting or poorly done, no one is going to care when the drama rolls in to shake everything up. That being said the two key characters that you're going to be following for this entire anime are anything but uninteresting. First you have Mei Tachibana a social exile for lack of better wording, who, when she was in elementary school, was blamed for killing the class rabbit by her 'friends' and after that point she didn't make another friend until she ran into... or rather roundhouse kicked the most popular dude in her high school, one Yamoto Kurosawa, who, for some odd reason, is instantly interested in Mei right after she kicks him off a staircase. \\n\\n\r\nNow Mei might come off as a predetermined tsundere once she opens her mouth, but she's actually rather shy and timid. While Yamoto is the silver-tongued-suave-lady killer, who's loved for being a nice dude at school... and apparently he's handsome.... No comment. But because these two MC's are pretty much polar opposite it (at first) felt like Yamoto was a cat chasing after a ball of yarn, Mei being the yarn, but after the second episode you realize that, no, Yamoto does in fact what to be serious with Mei affirmed by the line, \"You are mine.\".... *Whispers* I think he's a dominatrix. On a side note, the characters as a collective actually talk like they're in high school, they talk about sex and porn and boobs as, you know, actual people do/would.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound design, for the voices, was done to what I've come to expect as standard really, no one had an annoying voice and no one felt let the person voicing them had just woken up and wanted to go back to sleep, it was fine. Standard. Par. Good Enough. Alrig- Okay I'll shut up now. The music and sound queuing on the other hand was a little bit better than standard, at least at the start, the constant cutting of piano with the rapid editing of the visual blended really well, and I'll admit I actually jump a little with the scene featuring the train in the first episode. So the sound was all-round solid, nothing else to mention really.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation didn't do anything to make me go, \"OMG MY EYES!!!!!\" in you, is was pretty much on level with the sound, on scene from the first episode sticks out because Mei was screaming and waving her hands around and the camera is solely focusing on her face and everything in the background is blurred instead of a standard shot where everything is in focus and still.\\n\\n\r\nTHE BAD:\\n\r\nThe thing that this anime arguably lacks, personally I think it just doesn't really need it, is a plot. You can argue that it's about Mei learning to trust people again, but really the only thing that's driving all the events is the relationship, not that there's anything wrong with that, it'd just be better if something else would be happening apart from the Mei/Yamoto relationship and the various dramas unfolding because of that.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that felt really forced by this show was the message of 'everyone is the same, regardless of what they seem like' and this show really beats you over the head with that, ALL of the named characters have some sort of emotional or physical scar from the past that they somehow tie to Mei. Somehow. this aspect might be realistic, because there isn't a person on this planet that doesn't have some sort of damage like that, and if you're that person whose reading this saying, \"Nah not me.\" 1.Bullshit 2.Wait a little longer, then get back to me.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that personally annoyed me just a little bit was the final episode, episode 13, you could've ended the anime on episode 12 and nothing would've changed, I feel like they had the project done, but then realized that they needed something to do with all the time they had left and someone just put up their hand and said, \"How about another episode?\" That guy then got promoted.\\n\\n\r\nTHE VERDICT:\\n\r\nSukitte Iinayo is a good anime, it's nothing outstanding, but it does it's job properly, it shows you what you came for and nothing really apart from that, no hidden meaning (FRIENDSHIP IS A LIE!!), and some pretty nice characters  that have normal conversations, instead of straight avoiding those blasphemous words and acting all embarrassed and innocent when someone hints at it. Say \"I Love You\" won't pry those words out of my mouth, but it will get me to take it to dinner and walk it home.\\n\\n\r\nGoodbye my brethren, see you in the next one.",

            "content": "In a world full of strangers, full of people who hate you, no matter which way you turn, you can't trust anyone. Even if you reach out to someone, they will only end up using you or simply outright betray you. \r\nSukitte Il Na Yo, or Say I Love You, builds upon that premise with an added twist: what if the first person you begin to trust is your first love? This is quite a daunting situation because trust, as well as listening to each other, and spending time together, is an important element to a healthy relationship. It is similar to being forced torun before learning how to walk. You just can't do it without knowing the first steps.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the situation that our main female character, Tachibana Mei, is in. Having been bullied and excluded by friends during her childhood, Mei has withdrawn herself into her own cocoon as she enters high school. One day, the most popular guy's friend, named Kenji, pulls Mei's skirt, provoking her. Extremely pissed off, she ends up roundhouse kicking Yamato, who is the most popular guy in the school. It seems that her kick struck a chord in Yamato and he ends up seeing Mei as a love interest. I can't speak for all guys but, to all girls out there, kicking us guys, if we don't know you, will probably not make us fall in love with you. Anyway, \"Say I Love You\" follows a pretty typical shoujo plot: girl has problems, girl meets prince, prince changes girl's life, girl falls in love with prince. But this is not an anime where they get together and head off into the sunset riding on a white horse at the end. In fact, Mei and Yamato get together very early in the anime. What this anime shows is how they come to understand each other while being in a relationship. The situations that the couple was placed in were very interesting, especially the first couple or so, because given Mei's lack of trust in general, you get to experience her emotional turmoil as she struggles to understand what it takes to be in a relationship. However, as the anime approached the end, the situations were falling more into the generic Shoujo situations of misunderstandings and the like.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the primary storyline of the anime is the relationship between Mei and Yamato, there are a few subplots running about, especially near the end. I had a little bit of a hard time figuring out how those plots tied into the main story but they tie into the bigger themes of bullying, trust, and friendship. I would say the anime does a good job of weaving these small stories into the anime without having them end up feeling like fillers. \\n\\n\r\nThere is a relatively large cast of characters and unfortunately, most side characters don't get much development. I would say Aiko and Asami get a gradual development over the course of the story while the others seemed to just get a quick exposition and no more development afterwards. This is not a bad thing since I am seeing Sukitte for the action between Mei and Yamato but at the same time, the side characters were pretty interesting people that I wanted to understand more. \\n\r\nAside from the side characters, our two main characters are pretty good. Out of the entire cast, Mei is my favourite. Mei starts off as a really insecure character but as she grows in the relationship and climbs out of her cocoon, she reveals herself as a really good and passionate person, and in my opinion, a great girl for any guy to have. Yamato is a decent guy. Like most other shoujo anime, he is a heartthrob who can claim a girl's heart simply by breathing. Although he can go overboard with his desire to help everyone, he loves Mei with all his heart. His development is mostly stagnant throughout the entire anime and he mostly serves as developing Mei's character.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork in Sukitte is very good. It takes a more realistic approach with, of course, the usual characteristics of a shoujo anime: long armed and tall guys and (much to a guy's dismay) flat-as-a-board female MC (anyone get the reference to another great shoujo anime?). The colour palette showcased dim, perhaps even washed-out, colours. I thought it complemented well to the relatively quiet nature of the entire anime. The animators deserve a lot of credit as they depicted the facial expressions of the characters very well. I recall in one scene where there was little dialogue but the facial expressions and body language effectively conveyed the tense and confusing atmosphere of the situation.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was well done as well. Although the soundtrack doesn't reach epic status, the music in each scene was well selected. I also enjoyed the relatively quiet OP as it complements Mei's personality and perhaps her relationship with Yamato as well. The voice actors also did a very good job. Mei's voice actor, Kayano Ai, was also the voice for Menma from AnoHana and Ibara from Hyouka while Yamato's voice actor, Sakurai Takahiro, was the voice for Matsuyuki from AnoHana (nice complement there), Suzaku from Code Geass, Jin from Sakurasou no Pet, and (for laughs) Tentomon from Digimon. Props to both of them for bringing great chemistry to Mei and Yamato.\\n\\n\r\nSay I Love You is a decent anime. It is not just a story about love but also about opening up to others. Sometimes, just putting yourself out there can do wonders. Definitely give this anime a watch if you are romance fan or looking for an anime where you see how the relationship develops throughout the course of the show (rather than simply seeing the couples get together at the end)!\\n\\n\r\nLet me know what you think of Sukitte Il Na Yo! I would love to hear from you!",

            "content": "Sadly, I didn't enjoy this anime at all.\r\nStory (3)\r\nI didn't find anything particularly interesting about the story, and sometimes it was ridiculously predictive. Just your typical high school setting, except that there was nothing interesting about it in the slightest.\r\nArt (7)\r\nI would say the art is the best thing about this anime, even though it's not really my type. It is quite beautiful at times, but it's nothing spectacular.\r\nSound (5)\r\nNot much to say here.\r\nCharacter (2)\r\nThe thing I find most exciting about television is the characters. When they're all complex and interesting, they're almost a family, and each has their own strengths and flaws, and whenyou want to get to know them. This anime had none of that. I didn't find any of the characters interesting at all, each were painfully stereotypical. The female lead was interesting to me in the first episode - she seemed shy, lonely yet strong - but after the first episode, she became extremely bland, and everything she did was frustrating and boring. The other character, her love interest seemed so over-\"perfect\" that it was annoying and uninteresting. Also, the way that he fell \"in love\" with her seemed ridiculous and rushed, and it made no sense to me. I found myself rolling my eyes throughout the entire show. Some of the side characters had interesting back stories though, but that's about all.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (3)\\n\r\nThe first episode was enjoyable, I can admit that. It showed a lot of potential and it got me interested, which is why I kept watching. Sadly, it just went downhill from there. I felt no emotion towards any of the characters. However, I stuck through the show in hopes of a decent ending, which never really came.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nThere's absolutely nothing fun about the plot, story, anything. Isn't love supposed to be enjoyable to watch? Not painstakingly boring and cringe worthy?  I wouldn't recommend it. I've seen plenty of other romance animes that are way more enjoyable than this one, with characters you can realistically relate to, or fall in love with all the same. Not this though. Sorry :(",

Classic loser heroine and popular boy likes girl. \r\nOh, sure, the art was pretty good, but that's all. The only reason this anime was eye-catching was because of the artwork, IMO. \r\nHowever, I did enjoy the soundtrack. It matched the anime and feel of it. \r\nVery little character development. She was basically a loner, never doing anything or having any friends. He was a classical hot-popular guy with floods of girls who has asoft side for the mysterious girl who has painful self-esteem. (which is irritating as the series goes on.) \\n\\n\r\nI did enjoy at first, but that didn't last long. Just horrible. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I watched this a long time ago and I was so disappointed. I hear about how amazing it is and it baffles me. = _ = but, I guess it's just not my taste. There was nothing interesting about this anime.",

            "content": "Sukitte Ii na yo is a hard pill to swallow. One can be overwhelmed by the ambition that this anime tries to achieve, however such stray from the norm can overwhelm the audience to weaken its premise as a memorable romcom.\r\nThe art and music is presented with emotion that heightens the story. The anime's ED features Suneohair, who has also made EDs from other romances such as Honey and Clover and Arakawa Under the Bridge. In addition, the voice cast works hand and glove with each other, conveying the character's feelings that feels fit towards each person. \r\nHaving said that, the character development is leftwith silly misunderstandings and overwhelming drama that depicts society as a dismal place to live in. The supporting cast's lack of depth and main heroin's constant troubles overcloud the story into becoming more fictitious and far-fetched that believable. All the running gags and complications of a romance are shown in full effect, and while other anime such as Seto no Hanayome can pull this off with ease, Sukitte Ii na yo falls short. This can leave the audience yearning for more depth with Kurosawa and Tachibana (the main characters), but also shows the inconsistencies this anime possesses.\\n\\n\r\nIn retrospect, sukitte Ii na yo provides a refreshing breath of the romcom genre with ambitious strives and leaps, however falls short with its lack of character development and its display of having a non-memorable storyline.",

            "content": "[STORY]\r\n-----------\r\nThe story of this anime was very interesting, especially the beginning. It really gave us a lot of tension between Tachibana and Kurosawa, and seeing Tachibana learn the ways of talking to other people and learning who her true friends were was very interesting. Although, the ending was a little bit disappointing to me. I for one rarely find anime endings that are ever good. I was hoping for something romantic in the last episode. \r\n[ART]\r\n-----------\r\nThe quality was very good and clear, so there isn't much to say about this topic, although the scenery was kind of bland. \r\n[SOUND]\r\n-----------\r\nI never watched the dubbed version ofthis anime (if there even is one), but the subbed version was fantastic! The voice actress for Tachibana really showed the character's emotions as being shy very well. Although, there wasn't much background music, and the opening and ending didn't really suit my style. Of course, this is only my opinion.\\n\\n\r\n[CHARACTER]\\n\r\n-----------\\n\r\nI for one really liked Tachibana, because she really reminds me of myself. She always looked shy and seemed to have social phobia as well. Both Tachibana and Kurosawa were great characters. As for the others, like Kitagawa, she was one of the characters that really annoyed me, but it was only because of the plot, so she had to fit in with the story, but she was a real.. well.. jerk?\\n\\n\r\n[ENJOYMENT]\\n\r\n-----------\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the beginning of the anime. Again, it brought a lot of tension between the two main characters, but the ending was a disappointment to me. I did watch the sequel (Sukitte Ii na yo.: Dareka ga), but it didn't really explain much about what happened. I guess most anime just like to end with something that wants the audience to be creative and imagine what happens next themselves. Not bad!\\n\\n\r\nFINAL SCORE: \\n\r\n7/10 because of a disappointing ending",

            "content": "Sukitte Ii na yo. A very underrated anime, many people slate this anime but I believe if you're a fan of the romance genre you'll very much enjoy this and hence throughout this review I will tell you what the producers did well!\r\nPlease note due to the nature of this review I will reveal a very 'slight' spoiler, not of great importance and revealed about two episodes into the series anyway, however; please be cautious before reading on!\r\nStory - First of all, let's start with what I believe this anime did right in terms of its story line. As I'm sure you're aware mostromance anime show the two main protagonists slowly coming together near the end of the series. Unlike this, 'Sukitte Ii na yo' has the two main characters come together near the very start of the anime, thus showing how they develop as a couple rather than developing into a couple, this makes for a fun and new change of pace for romance genre lovers.\\n\\n\r\nArt - I was a great fan of the artwork, I believe in general there was great simplicity, though I found the portrayal of the characters was fantastic! The characters were drawn in a way that almost gave insight into their characteristics: shy; naive; confident or so on, almost allowing the audience to foreshadow later events.\\n\\n\r\nSound - I have little to comment on the sound other than, having personally watched the Dubbed version, the voice acting was strong and representative of the characters. I'm unaware what the original voice acting sounds like however.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter  - Naturally, in the genre of romance; characters are very important, especially when it comes to the main male and female protagonists. I want to avoid any further spoilers so will avoid telling of how these characters change the direction of the story, but will however comment on how their range of different characteristics allow the anime to have an edge, keeping the audience intent and interested with the story. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - I found great enjoyment within this anime and believe it has high 'rewatch' value, I was content with the ending and didn't feel the need for any further story. The anime truly ended on a good note whilst also providing fan service.\\n\\n\r\nLast notes - Let's end this review in a conclusive manner, is 'Sukitte Ii na yo' worth a watch in my own opinion? Yes, the anime excels its expectations, providing a chilled, fell good and more over a enjoyable experience!",

            "content": "I can't decide whether to praise or diss this anime. I could write a review gushing about how great it is, or a scalding one about it's downfalls. I'll do both.\r\nPros: \r\n-The romance itself is quite good. It's interesting to see the different sides of each other they bring out. They make one another less boring and have a truly touching love story, as sudden and maybe even forced as it was. They have heavy chemistry and you can understand why they love each other, even if seems that they fell in love rather fast.\r\n-That being said, Mei's character isn't your regular happy, cheerful, submissivegirl (well...), but she's interesting in that we can all relate to her pain and loneliness. She has had some tough experiences that were a bit dramatized and probably are...uncommon...but possible, and the pain she felt at being rejected by her classmates and being hurt over and over by her friends, is something we can all definitely relate to. \\n\r\n-There is no annoying waiting. The main love interest tells her he likes her quickly, and they don't take ages to get together, which is refreshing. They are also surprisingly honest with each other, which is nice to see and helps the romance come at a faster, better rate. \\n\r\n-The art is absolutely beautiful. \\n\r\n-The story is familiar, but it has some new elements that make it interesting and very unique. \\n\r\n-The romantic interest isn't a cold jerk to the girl for once. He is the cliche popular, rich, perfect player guy, but he is actually very kind, considerate and warm towards Mei, which is refreshing and interesting. \\n\r\n-They have a very balanced relationship. He is considerate towards her, and Mei is honest with him. There is no one person dominating the other. They have one of the healthiest relationships I've seen. \\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-The romance is good in terms of chemistry, but it happens way too suddenly, way too fast. You blink, and they're in love. He's nice to her, sure, but at the same time, she doesn't come off as the type to be so trusting and loving right away after all she's been though....\\n\r\n-Talking about Mei, she goes off character many times. She goes from a cold,  prickly girl to a moe, kawaii blushing cute girl in the span of four seconds. It's just uncharacteristic to change so fast. It's not character development, it's just conveniently changing her with no reason to make her cuter, more appealing, and better for the romance relationship. \\n\r\n-I can't stand the music, but some may, so I rated it average. \\n\r\n-The main male romantic interest is boring. I've seen him in nearly every shoujo anime - arrogant but kind, perfect, good at sports, good at academics, rich, popular, every girl loves him yet he chooses the loser girl, player....yeah. Been done before, and there's no development or even backstory for him. He's kind and a great boyfriend, but beyond that, very hollow, shallow character with little interesting things about him. \\n\r\n-A lot of the obstacles seem very forced, cliche, overdone and overdramatized. They take the smallest thing and blow it up to be some huge, mindblowing issue. It's just not that great story-wise. The plot is forced and kind of blind, despite some good themes it brings in.",

            "content": "I have a difficult time trying to comprehend Say \"I Love You\". On the one hand, it has some of the most realistic interactions and relationships between characters that I have ever seen, with characters able to talk about kissing and sex without getting kicked 10m across the room. On the other hand, taking advantage of a girl in the middle of the day by forcibly kissing her as a way of \"scaring away a stalker\" is considered perfectly acceptable. \r\nIt's kind of hard to fairly judge romance stories in anime. A lot of their basic premises are so similar, a lot of people willwrite them off as being \"clich\u00e9\" or \"unoriginal\". But what makes each individual romance story unique is its execution. Say \"I Love You\" attempts to break through the cage of unoriginality by presenting us viewers with characters that actually accept the fact that they love and care for each other. No big misunderstandings. No cockblocks. No elaborate schemes by side characters to bring the painfully obvious couple together. Just pure, unadulterated romance. The way it should be.\\n\\n\r\nDespite loving the realistic way the show presents itself at the beginning, I have some major complaints about some of the directions the plot decides to take and how certain events unfold. It left me feeling dissatisfied and, at times, a tad frustrated.\\n\\n\r\nIn the same vein that the story left me feeling dissatisfied, the main set of characters are a rather mixed bag as well. Tachibana Mei is your run-of-the-mill shoujo protagonist. She has no friends and looks and acts average in every way possible. A prefect slate for most of the show's viewers to place themselves into. Kurosawa Yamato, on the other hand, is your run-of-the-mill shoujo love interest. He has loads of friends and looks and acts cool in every way possible. A perfect character to have the show's viewers romanticise about. And thus a beautiful romance was born (?).\\n\\n\r\nJoking aside, the characters do have some quality to them. Tachibana's slow progression from having no friends to realising that she has people she can rely on is incredibly heartwarming, and the way that Kurosawa helps her achieve this is very cute. She is a very flawed person that can make you mad or even cringe at times, but that's just what makes her such a strong character. \\n\\n\r\nKurosawa is the opposite. His flaws aren't what make you angry, but instead, his supposed lack of flaws. His over-confidence and easy-going attitude make him, at times, detestable. However, he is not always awful. His devotion to Tachibana and his realisation of his (many) mistakes make up for his blandness.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the main characters' lost potential, it's hard to call either of them \"unlikeable\". I wish I could say the same about the supporting cast. Barely any of them are interesting in the slightest, and those that are don't get enough development to become anything memorable. It seems as though almost every character has bullied or has been bullied, and we should feel sorry for them either way. By the end, I didn't care for any of them (except maybe Kai).\\n\\n\r\nThe standout feature of Say \"I Love You\" has nothing to do with story or character but is instead its sound/art design. It may not be masterful, but they did a pretty fine job with the animation. Every character moves as they should do and nothing feels out of the ordinary. Both songs are excellent, despite being somewhat typical. And, the voice actors did a great job capturing the emotions of each character.\\n\\n\r\nSay \"I Love You\" is the exact same romance story you've seen hundreds of times over, but with the help of likeable protagonists, fantastic pacing and endearing relationships, it manages to stand head and shoulders above the flooded see of mediocrity and becomes something worth your time.\\n",

            "content": "Honestly, I loved this anime. It sure isn't the most original anime but it's wonderful in it's own way. \r\n Story: It's your typical popular boy falls for shy girl romance blooms. However this is probably one of the most realistic romances I've seen in a while. Mei falls for Yamato but that doesn't mean everything is perfect between them. She's still painfully shy around him and sometimes says things she doesn't mean because she doesn't know how else to react in that situation. Sure there's lots of clich\u00e9 jealousy but that happens in real life. There's just something so sweet about this couple youwant to keep watching more. \\n\\n\r\n Art: Not much to say, I really liked the animation of it. It's quite refreshing and smooth. It has clean lines and crisp colors. There's a watercolor-ish feel to the background as well. \\n\\n\r\n Music: The opening and ending songs are a bit annoying a first, but by the end of the anime I came to realize how nicely they fit in. Very sweet and slow. As far as the background music I thought it fit in nicely with the anime but nothing spectacular. \\n\\n\r\n Character: Mei, well at first she seems to fall into the Mary-sue trap but once you understand her character I think she's wonderful. She's very easy to relate to and root for and all her reactions to the situations are realistic. She's painfully shy at points but slowly begins to open herself up and make friends. Along the way convincing and helping other people as well. \\n\r\nYamato kind of comes off as cocky jerk. Which is true for the first couple of episodes. But you can tell he genuinely likes Mei and being in a relationship with her changes him. You can tell he's gotten all he's wanted all his life, and now he has to work to keep Mei. (Mei also has to work to keep him.) \\n\\n\r\n Enjoyment: I just really like this anime. It's by no means perfect but their relationship is so real. I came to genuinely care about the characters and when they cried I cried. The show also touches about a lot of important topics. Examples: How important is beauty, trusting people, bullying, how people view you, and most importantly being yourself. \\n\\n\r\n Overall: If you love romance then you'll love this show. There isn't much action but it's a sweet anime. I'd recommend giving it a shot.",

The soundtrack has aslow, uplifting vibe which offers a similar ambience to actually good shows like Mushishi and the Aria series. Quite often the only background sounds are birds chirping or the sound of feet tapping on the sidewalk which honestly is pretty neat. The relaxing, feelgood vibes always set the ideal mood when entering scenes. The OP/EP are both excellent as well. Unfortunately it takes more than a good soundtrack to make a show any good, so it\u2019s all downhill from here im afraid ;)\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Art (4):\\n\r\n The art and animation isn't awful, I mean, it's not good either. The drawings are quite often noticeably bad, eyes pointing in weird directions, triangle boobs, literally a rectangle to draw someones entire body.. But for the most part it's not awful?\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (3): \\n\r\nLets start off with my least favorite character, Yamato.. His literal only character traits is that he is popular, good looking, creepy, hypocritical, self centered, probably even a sociopath.. oh an he's kind, sometimes? Almost half the show is about him pressuring Mei into sexual favors all the while claiming the opposite. \"lets take this slow\" as he forces himself onto her whilst just assuming she wants it \"cuz im popular, duh\". Later in the show he shows himself up to be one of the more hypocritical characters i've seen in anime, all to add a lil bit o' that drama. \\n\\n\r\nNext up we have Mei Tachibana. Her character in the first few episodes was actually the one redeeming quality about the show. She had integrity, was honest, had her own character (as raw as it was). Unfortunately her character actually regresses and loses personality the further into the show you go. Take note all, if you get a BF you're supposed to have your entire life revolve around him and lose all of your character traits so you are a literal walking drama-doll. If he talks to another girl? DRAMA! If he forgets to text you? DRAMA! If he doesn't show up to school because he's sick. OH SHIT, DRAAAMAAAAA!! \\n\\n\r\nthe other two main characters (Yamatos childhood friends/GF) show up out of nowhere.. Guess what their entire purpose for being there is? Yep, DRAMACLOCK. Sadly, these two characters are probably the MOST DEVELOPED CHARACTERS IN THE ENTIRE SHOW.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory (3): ehh.. I think my character discussion kind of explained the entire stories structure. The end goal is accomplished in the first two episodes, the rest of the show is just adding unneeded melodrama in order to \"develop\" their relationship. \\n\\n\r\nFortunately there are some genuinely well written moments in this show. There will be moments you feel bad for characters, feel pity for them, even feel like you understand them. \\n\r\nUnfortunately those moments are very few and far between.\\n\\n\r\nDialogue (2):\\n\r\nJesus, where to start.. This show has the worst dialogue I have ever seen. I'm not even joking. Na you know what, the dialogue is the best part of the show. It gives you something to laugh at. \\n\\n\r\nThere you have it, fellas. \"say 'i love you'\", A modern masterpiece. I highly recommend this show to everyone. \\n",

            "content": "A mediocre tale written about a mediocre girl who falls in love with a mediocre guy, how cute. \r\nSay I Love You is the story about a girl who is never noticed falling in love with a guy that everyone noticed. In other words, it is the even more basic version of every high school drama series ever created. \r\nStory: 4\r\nThe storyline isn't the worst and at times it comes off as quite adorable. It is also a storyline that many of us can relate to, if you were the kind of kid who was never popular in high school. \r\nBasically, Mei (female protagonist) isa very antisocial girl who decides not to make anymore friends in high school. That all changes one day when she finally meets this guy, whom for some reason she has never seen before despite them going to a high school where everyone knows everyone, and he changes her outlook on social activity. Hooray!\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe art is the only really good thing in this show. The characters are drawn well and everything looks very calmly and peaceful, which sets the mood for this kind of series. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nThe music is nice and the overall sound is very appealing. However, it is still not all that unique comparitively speaking. Voice acting matched the characters well,  but nothing special enough for me to write about. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 2.8\\n\r\nThe characters, all of them, are completely stagnant and poorly developed.\\n\\n\r\nFirst you have Mei, which we all know to be antisocial, but I mean she could have at least tried harder in life. I watched the entire 13 episodes hoping I would watch her blossom into this mature woman, but nooooooo. She is beyond passive, and despite gaining a bit more confidence she still has the same mediocre tone to her personality.\\n\\n\r\nThen you have Yamato, the king of \"marty stues\". He is not only the best looking guy in the world, but he has messed around with every single girl he's met yet manages to still treat them with respect. Aw, how thoughtful of him to treat a human being like a human being, that must mean he is the most absolute perfect boyfriend in the world.\\n\r\nThe writers are trying to fool you into thinking he is this perfect guy, but he is completely docile and clueless when it comes to the poor behavior of himself or the people around him. And sure, he is a good boyfriend (at one point) to Mei, but you quickly realize he lacks the perfect qualities you are fooled into believe he has. However, it is still played off as if he can do no wrong and it makes the entire theme feel completely phony.\\n\\n\r\nThen you have everyone else, who is either beautiful and stupid or beautiful and rude. Either way, you are forced to believe that beautiful people cannot have bland personalities, that's for ugly people. I mean, this is why Mei is ugly, right? *rolls eyes*\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4\\n\r\nSome of the scenes were very adorable to watch, and it is nice to watch shows where someone makes friends and their bond grows stronger. However, the entire series feels so fake when it comes to those strong bonds of love and friendship. \\n\r\nAll of Mei's friends are still better friends with Yamato, and they truly behave in the way of putting Yamato before her. She doesn't define her relationship and she never defines her relationship, Yamato is their relationship. This makes the series very frustrating to watch, especially since none of the characters really improve in terms of quality.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3.9\\n\r\nWelp, it's not the worst anime I have ever seen...\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Oh how I wanted to say, I love you to Sukitte Ii na yo...  but I just can\u2019t because you\u2019re a flat two dimensional romance that just didn\u2019t live up to my expectations.  It really is a shame, because Suki na yo had a tremendous amount of potential and gave us some things we don\u2019t often get to see in the romance genre.  But as the series winds down I found myself lamenting what could have been.\r\nIt\u2019s hard for me to be too hard on the romance anime plot premise, I mean they have pretty much already all been done before andthey are all mostly silly as well.  Suki na yo is no different, with the unlikely story of the hot and most popular guy in school falling for a shy, friendless loner who kicked him down the stairs because she mistakenly thought he flipped her skirt.  The beginnings of true and lasting love if I ever saw it.  The girl Mei, and the boy Yamato, both have some interesting personality issues on the surface and despite the silliness of their meeting there was some enormous amount of potential in their relationship.  However this is sadly mostly wasted over the course of the story.\\n\\n\r\nNow here is where Suki na yo is a bit different from its other romance cousins.  For the most part our lead characters are in a relationship together from the beginning to the end of the series.  The typical format is 99% courting with the eventual payoff at the end when our little lovebirds finally realize their mutual affections.  While it can often be frustrating when it is drug out with silly misunderstandings and character cockblocks at least by then we have a clear understanding why they both love each other. The show is called Say I love you, but it should probably more aptly called Say why I love you.   \\n\\n\r\nEven though I have some pretty serious complaints about the way the shows romance and plot unfolds, I can\u2019t say I didn\u2019t enjoy watching this series.  But when you compare it with its peers within the genre and even shows that were airing during the same time as this, it comes across as distinctly average and ordinary.\\n\\n\r\nMuch in the same way as the story is underwhelming, so are the series main characters.  A romance is by nature very character driven and if we don\u2019t get compelling leads it\u2019s pretty difficult to care if they end up falling in love with each other.  Mei is your standard \"everyman\" kind of girl typical in shoujo romances.  She\u2019s cute, though not particularly beautiful, and pretty much average in every other way.  She\u2019s a nice girl with a strong spirit but very vulnerable as well.  Exactly the kind of girl most people can relate too and can root for as well.  It\u2019s sweet how she slowly comes out of her shell and makes friends and learns to trust people again as well.  Even though this mostly comes across pretty corny and clich\u00e9d.  Though hell I like corny and clich\u00e9d anyway.\\n\\n\r\nYamato is less interesting and in many ways is also your typical bishounen leading man.  Though I will give him some credit for breaking the trend and not being a cold, aloof, and unfeeling jerk.  You get the feeling most of the time he has genuine feelings for Mei but at other times he\u2019s actions around her seemed to be a bit condescending and they he was treating her more like a pet and as an equal partner.  I felt some aspects of his personality were also very inconsistent, especially later in the series.  For a guy who came across as supremely confident he was surprisingly weak willed at times and his distrust of Mei's feelings at times was implausible considering what the pair had been through to that point already.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast is the weakest link though and stereotypical shoujo fair.  This plays in to the weakness of the plot but basically the same themes are repeated multiple times over the course of the story.  Girl appears, of course hopefully in love with Yamato, drama unfolds, girl is rejected and our leads love continues.  And the rejected gets new love and becomes best friends with our dear Mei.  While I mostly liked the supporting characters they simply lack the depth for them to be actually interesting.  Then of course you have to look past the unlikelihood that two romantic rivals are going to be besties afterwards, particularly when one side was involved in some pretty nasty schemes and bullying.\\n\\n\r\nDespite all these flaws though what Suki na yo really does best is both its artwork and musical soundtrack.  Both are typical of the genre but I really did love both of the songs.  The seiyuu cast is comprised of mostly veterans but none of them are real stars.  I thought they did solid, if unspectacular work.  While the artwork may not be a masterwork, it is very fluid and reality based, with clothes and body types that stay in the realm of possibility.\\n\\n\r\nEven though in the end I have quite a few complaints about Suki na yo, it\u2019s still a good watch.  If you\u2019re really starved, as I was, for a romance anime with a sweet ending and are not demanding to be shown some that\u2019s never been seen before then you should have a good time with it as well.\\n",

            "content": "I've sat and tried to figure out what is so special about this anime. It really doesn't bring anything new to the table. You have your awkward girl, the hot guy who seems to like her, and some competition for his affections. Pretty standard formula. \r\nHowever, this anime actually accomplishes it WELL. Where it stands out is how dead on and absolutely accurate it depicts falling in love HARD the first time. Even if you've been in love several times, you'll find something in Mei and Yamato's relationship that may bring tear to your eye. \r\nMei is a good character. Several female leads in thissort of role invariably fall into the \"Mary-Sue\" trap and end up just being an empty shell. What makes Mei stand out is the decisions she makes and how she reacts to the situations around her. Throughout watching all the episodes, I watched Mei make the same decisions I would of as a girl in her position in high school. She is realistic and very easy to sympathize with. \\n\\n\r\nYamato's character could have easily suffered from the same sort of stigma that befalls his character archetype. The typical, popular, good-looking guy. This could have easily turned into a 13 episode version of the movie \"She's All That\" but his character keeps it from doing so. Yamato actually comes off like he has an absolutely beautiful soul. He strikes you as that rare individual that is good inside and out and instead of \"making over\" the heroine in his popular image he seems like he was looking for someone like her all along. Then he works to get others to see she's actually a good person the way she is. \\n\\n\r\nTheir budding relationship is realistic as well, save for the part with Yamato's little sister. That part came out of left field but I digress. Watching them learn from each other and grow is entertaining and you want nothing more than to root for their happiness while watching. The show leaves you with warm fuzzy feelings inside that stick around for a while. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is gorgeous and the music complements it perfectly. The intro took me a bit to get used to but once I did I found it very cute. Overall, even if you're the type to shun the typical \"romance, shoujo, slice of life\" anime - PLEASE try his one. It's worth it.",

            "content": "Sukitte Ii na yo is a gem. I mean it as a gem that sparkles, shines, and is one of those rare classic shoujo that is pleasing to audience who are into the drama medium. The series is quite something to take an insight on because of the way it presents itself. Let's think of it this way and picture yourself in the story:\r\nYou're an individual who has a troubled past. You have been ostracized by various circumstances and nowadays, you don't give a damn what anyone thinks about you or your life. That is till you meet one of the hottest student at schoolwho takes an interest in you. Your heart pounds and for the first time in your life, you give a damn about your life and those around you especially regarding that student. That, my friends, is where Sukitte Ii na yo shines. It's a discovery and it's a classic.\\n\\n\r\nSukitte Ii na yo (also known as Say \"I Love You\".) is an anime series adapted from the manga written by Kanae Hazuki. The animation studio, Zexcs handles its production which is already known for some of its past works in the romance department such as Da Capo, Fortune Arterial, and H2O: Footprints in the Sand. The series fits within the romance and drama side as opposed to a pure romantic comedy because of the story involved. \\n\\n\r\nLike I mentioned before, the series is a classic for those into the shoujo medium. It is like a breath of fresh air to watch especially with the lighthearted backgrounds presented. For those into some school drama involving the typical high school life, it's like a journey all over again. \\n\\n\r\nThe series kicks off with a girl named Mei Tachibana. She is nothing special although she used to get well along with others. Unfortunately, it seems that events in the past has shut her down and made her an unsociable person. In fact, classmates who knows her describes Mei as a girl who keeps to herself with little words and a person stuck in her own little world. Yet at the same time, we can see Mei as an honest girl who is caring, loyal, and willing to help others when the time calls for it. But time isn't always on her side especially during a day when she bumps heads to heads with the most popular student at school. \\n\\n\r\nHere's where the drama kicks in and his name is Yamato Kurosawa.\\n\\n\r\nYamato is one of the most popular guys at school and his name may even suggest a male version of Yamato Nadeshiko (no pun intended). He meets Mei in a very unusual way at school and later on so helps her with a problem involving a stalker. Yikes! Now, from there on and out, the two forms a bond despite Mei's stubbornness. \\n\\n\r\nNow, the duo seems to very incompatible at first glance. I mean, Mei is one of the most plain looking girls at school with a plain way of dealing with her life. On the other hand, Yamato is the most popular guy at school who is idolized by many of the students. Sounds like living on the opposite of the world, right? Yet, what these two individuals share in common is their willingness to take on life itself with their ways of helping others and discover themselves. It's a pleasant watch and a rare gem we don't see too common in today's shoujo theme series. Later on, Mei and Yamato forges a relationship that seems to get quite the attention. \\n\\n\r\nI honestly think the duo are quite compatible that balances out each other. We know that Mei is a plain looking girl who is clumsy yet very honest with herself and with others. Yamato often goes out helping his classmates as well by putting others above himself. We can see that he dislikes people who just likes him for his appearance. When Yamato realizes that Mei likes him beyond just his physical appearance, the two becomes quite compatible. Although loathed by some of the other students at school, they are a good match. \\n\\n\r\nThe other characters also plays their roles in the story as well that often brings forth new surprises and obstacles to the couple. That brings for the drama into the series. \\n\\n\r\nOn the male side, we have Kai Takemura who has very similar circumstances with Mei. Both of them had a past they wish they can forget but they manage to move on. After their encounter, Kai becomes part of the love triangle between Yamato, Mei, and himself. It's drama to the D especially when we see Yamato's jealous and defensive side. On the female side, there is Megumi Kitagawa. She is seen as an idol on similar status with Yamato and is possibly what Mei wants to be: popular and beautiful. Yet, we see behind that outer shell is a very insecure girl who seems sweet but is only aiming at her own goals, aka Yamato. The three of them is a love triangle that makes Mei once again examine herself and the relationship she forms.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall execution of the series follows that typical shoujo theme ways of portraying its ways, settings, and backgrounds. As such, expect some cliched and predictable moments especially between the duo of Mei and Yamato. Even from the pilot episode, it can be easy to tell where the direction the two are heading. The misunderstandings and some of the drama are also easy to see through especially involving Megumi. It's no surprising either that in high school, all sort of situations happen and love is may just be one of them. The series takes that love between the duo and drives it throughout each episode as obstacles and events are presented. It shows how much they discover themselves and how much they can change when they understand each other.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork of the series is quite realistic and portrays the backgrounds with the school life setting. The various classrooms, playgrounds, and characters are real and needs to be in that way to convey to the viewers what high school is all about. Yuka Hirama (the art director) does a wonderful job of that crafting the characters. Mei is painted as a plain looking girl. Yamato is painted as cool looking guy. Megumi is painted as a school idol with a beautiful figure. Kei is painted as a guy that used to have a rebellious nature. It is all there and the audience can see how each of them fits within their boundaries within the artwork department.\\n\\n\r\nSimilarly, the soundtrack of the series is lighthearted. Although not too well known, Yuuji Nomi engineers the series' music with his skills to create a sense of being there. It's nothing too special because it mostly is lighthearted and hardly noticeable at times. However, it is a sweet melody that depicts the settings and the characters especially the opening song. \"Friendship ~ for Sukitte Ii na yo\" by Ritsuko Okazaki is a very lighthearted song that gives off that melody of sweetness which depicts the duo's sweet relationship. Similarly, the ED song follows the same suit to match the lightheartedness of the series.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Sukitte Ii na yo is a pleasant series to watch. The relationship between Mei and Yamato is quite warming and realistic to what some of us may have experienced during our teen years. It's heartwarming, sweet, and at the same time has drama to it especially involving the other characters. It is also a shoujo that fits within its boundaries without going over heels or trying too hard. Ultimately, it's a rare  little gem that deserves praise for its beauty.",

            "content": "Sukitte Ii na yo was my first romance anime to watch and I decided to write this review in order to convey to you all of my thoughts about it. Well, when I was watching the earliest episodes, I thought it was really underrated. There are many out there that don\u2019t really like it (and I\u2019m talking about girls certainly) and that was always leads it to be given really unfair ratings.\r\nWell that\u2019s exactly the problem with romance animes. Their stories redound to become mainstream and that\u2019s why they don\u2019t appeal much on their viewers, so that makes them complete them without considerate them asa big deal. But here we have something special. A HUGE deal, actually lol. \\n\r\nSo, let\u2019s start from the basics.\\n\\n\r\nWe have our typical social-awkward girl and the popular hot guy who falls in love with her. Of course I was like \u201cawww\u201d when hearing the typical love words and stuff like \u201cyou\u2019re my everything\u201d, but what I liked more was the participation of the other characters in the story. I mean, watching a couple doing stuff all over the anime is totally boring. But here, you will see development in the characters. They will narrate their different pasts, their different stories and reveal sad truths and facts about them. So, there were some life lessons as well. Trying hard to be accepted by the others -so much that you harm yourself, overcoming your fears, the meaning of friendship, be envy of the others, isolate yourself. All these applied on the characters making you enjoy the show as you see how relations between them are being developed. And I think that was actually what made me curious about the next episode, watching it right after the previous \u2018cause I just couldn\u2019t wait at all :P What I also liked was the way that characters showed up in the show, leaving you more curious and making you wanting to \u201cexplore\u201d their personalities and find out their connection to the rest of the characters, as well (which was an another strong point of the anime).\\n\\n\r\nSo, about the \u201cromantic\u201d side, I have to say that I really liked it. You can clearly see what love really means, what love really is just by how the relation between the two main characters is developed. And this anime taught me that love has to do with completing and dedicating completely to each other. Hahah, and I\u2019m putting aside the cute main character, our loving Yamato. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nSukitte Ii na Yo was a decent romance anime. Not too girly nor boring and totally NOT stupid at all. It can keep you stuck to it until the end through its great love story, the shapely art, the variety of the characters and the zestful relations/connections between them.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Say 'I Love You.'\r\nWhere do I even start with this anime. The title even gives off an exceedingly romantic, unrealistic atmosphere. If there was ever a competition for \"The Most Generic Shoujo,\" Say 'I Love You' would take the cake. \r\nLet's start off with a brief summarization. A reserved young girl who has no social connection whatsoever plays as the object of desire for the most popular, handsome boy in the school. They eventually establish an awkward relationship filled with uncomfortable dialogue and well, there you have it. There really isn't much else to say about this anime. It's simplistic, it doesn't try to breakany boundaries, and it's so monotonous it will probably make you yawn and fall asleep. It executed what every romantic comedy anime out there has ever attempted to accomplish. I can guarantee that you have seen this same template numerous times before, and I can also promise that you have seen better. \\n\\n\r\nStory - 4 / 10 \\n\\n\r\nThe story is generic and monotonous. It does not bring anything new to the table that makes itself memorable, or leave a mark behind in history. You can summarize the story in one sentence, and the reader could predict everything that will ever happen in the anime. Is there any completely unexpected plot twist? Is there any cliffhanger that leaves you at the edge of your seat? Or maybe there is some sort of symbolism, or undertone that it is trying to portray. The answer is 'no' to all of your questions. The story is basically a silly, happy-go-lucky, simplistic romance that has been repeated too many times before with absolutely no depth whatsoever. The pacing also made me uncomfortable. First episode they meet, second they kiss, and third, they automatically become a boyfriend and girlfriend. It's immature and childish, and definitely does not represent the singular theme they have been emphasizing throughout this entire anime, which is indeed 'love.' The storyline was just another contribution to why I find Say 'I Love You' so bland. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 5 / 10 \\n\\n\r\nThe art is satisfactory. It doesn't do anything extraordinary, but it certainly isn't disgusting. The somewhat likable character design, and the brightening colors that were incorporated into the background scenery was what gave its' animation a semi-respectable score, and I am sorry to say, is the pinnacle of this anime's accomplishment. Other than the sparkle and the twinkle that they sprinkle and sugarcoat in every single shoujo anime, Say 'I Love You' does not outdo any other anime with its' art. To wrap it up, it does its' job, and with the wide variety of spectrum the animation studio ventures into when they bring this anime to life is a compliment I am reluctant to give, but I will just for the anime's mentionable work. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 4 / 10 \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of Say 'I Love You' is almost like a lullaby. It puts you into a slumber, and makes you wonder whether Say 'I Love You' is supposed to make you fall asleep or make you giggle and laugh over the chemistry experienced throughout adolescence. The opening theme is a heartwarming hymn, but certainly isn't anything special. It's calm, collected, but definitely doesn't introduce the romantic aspect of Say 'I Love You', but gives you a more wistfully composed orchestral piece. The quiet piano and violin strumming away in the background is soothing and gentle, but it just didn't break a barrier or kick down a wall for me. The ending theme is practically an identical twin to its' opening theme counterpart. The OST? More whimsical singing, making me picture it to be more of a children nursery rhyme than a love song. In conclusion, the sound? Nothing remarkable. But still bearable. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 3 / 10 \\n\\n\r\nThe characterization throughout Say 'I Love You' is most likely the worst part of this anime. The main female protagonist is timid, reserved Mei Tachibana. Her introduction actually somewhat drew me in-- an anti-social, pessimistic student who doesn't believe in establishing relationships with her classmates. This really hooked me-- I wanted to know more about her perspective on the everyday boundaries of school life, and her thoughts/opinions on social hierarchy, interactions, etc. I also really liked it when I noticed the courage she possessed when she gave the most popular boy at her school a roundhouse kick in the face! But then this bright, intelligent, and audacious young woman that I believed had such an interesting view on the world suddenly transformed into your ordinary tsundere character who would never respond to the male protagonist, Yamato Kurosawa's affection. Which brings me to my next point. Yamato Kurosawa has got to be one of my least favorite characters in Say 'I Love You.\" He is perfect, almost robotically so. Yamato Kurosawa, the academic all star, the athletic champion, the wealthy son of a successful family, and on top of all that he has a beautiful face and a social life. Which is what makes him so monotonous to observe as a character. I didn't like how there wasn't anything wrong with him. He is a human, not an alienish demigod who excels at everything he does. I also didn't like the sudden fluctuation between his interest in Mei. First he is all over her, his top priority, the one individual he wanted to see and spend his time with, and then all of a sudden, he almost forgets her. The process rinses and repeats like a cycle. Neither Mei Tachibana nor Yamato Kurosawa did their role as the main protagonist justice, not even decently so, which is why the score they have received is so long. It would have been even lower if Mei Tachibana's introduction wasn't so solid. This aspect of Say 'I Love You' was yet another factor that made this anime so disappointing. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 3 / 10 \\n\\n\r\nAlright, I will admit it. I don't usually watch shoujo anime. Yes, I have seen a lot of excellent shoujo anime, and I have seen a lot of completely gagworthy shoujo anime. Say 'I Love You' to me is just a mediocre, soap opera fling. It is a decent anime to watch if you want to completely turn off your constructively critical brain, and just enjoy a romantic comedy. But that does not forgive the English bran muffin of a storyline, and the disastrous characterization. Say 'I Love You' has done everything that has already been done, and if not worse. I certainly did NOT enjoy this anime, and this is coming from a female adolescent, which I believe is Say 'I Love You' 's target demographic. It claims itself to be a romantic comedy slice-of-life. But I did find the relationship that Mei and Yamato shared to be romantic, but more awkward, prepubescent, and coming-of-age. The most that Mei and Yamato did was hold themselves in an uncomfortable embrace, or a sudden kiss here or there. In my opinion, an adolescent attraction is not what love is, and if you haven't noticed already from its' title, is what this anime is trying so hard to emphasize. It claims itself to possess comedy, and will promise laughter. But the jokes that were displayed only put a halfhearted smile on my face, because well, I can't put it anymore bluntly than it wasn't funny, and definitely didn't provide any entertainment for me as the audience. It does what it's supposed to with its' slice of life genre, which isn't all too interesting to witness anyway. You have your high school, identical uniforms, and handsome/beautiful boys and girls. Nothing ever happened, nothing ever happens, and nothing ever will happen. Say 'I Love You' just wasn't for me. \\n\\n\r\nAnd with that, I give it an overall score of 4 / 10. \\n\r\nSorry. :/ \\n",

            "content": "It is all about the looks? Is your appearance really all that matters?\r\nThis anime brings a serious problem to our attention in a modern way taking a quite complicated school life as an example. Not becoming an outsider or being bullied means being nice to everybody, wearing designer clothes, accessories, make-up, as well as keeping your mouth shut, when someone gets hurt. So much effort to survive in school.\r\nDo I really need to be like everybody else?\r\nIt\u2019s difficult to be an individual in this school. Having fake friends is better than having none, you would think. None of us likes to be betrayed, but atthe same time you cannot rely on yourself only. Some might prefer not having friends like that, others cannot understand it at all. I can quite correspond to the main character\u2019s choice. Opening up after being hurt is always difficult.\\n\\n\r\nWhy did the best looking guy at school choose this particular girl? Why not me, when I sacrificed everything to look that great now?\\n\r\nExpectations. It may be painful, but love at a first sight is possible, which most of the people do not understand. Its above all these things like looks, money or having many friends. It saddens me, that because of a peer pressure at school some of the students fight over boys or girls, just to have sex with her/ him. And having sex with someone popular or handsome at school means I will become popular too. \\n\\n\r\nAt some point, many do not understand or will never experience what is like to be loved, so why not try and ruin other people\u2019s luck? Will our first love and relationship overcome all these obstacles? Am I strong enough to cope with all that? I am impatiently waiting for another episode to find out.\\n",

This is all my own opinion, and if you don't agree with it, then that's okay too. We are all entitled to our opinions.\r\nSukitte Ii na yo (Say \"I Love You\") was an anime I knowingly walked into as the new love story of the year.  Except it surprised me, in the best way possible.  The story seemed to rush into the love story at the beginning, I didn't really expect anything more than that.Except the story took a new twist.\\n\\n\r\nThe story took a deeper path, by looking at the background of almost every character, the things that had happened to them.  Basically their dark secrets.  For each one it was either being a bully, or being bullied.  The story turned from this silly love story, into watching people overcome fears, battle their pasts, and learn to trust others.\\n\\n\r\nIf there was one thing I took out of this anime, it was this:\\n\\n\r\nEveryone has a story to tell.  And the way people act now, is because of something in their past.  And if you never learn about that past, then you don't know the real them.\\n\\n\r\nA quote from the anime:\\n\\n\r\n\"But there's nothing wrong to worrying. It's like a wall you need to overcome, to make it to the next level. If you're running up against that wall, it means you're moving forward. I wonder how many walls I've broken up until now, but if you wont move yourself, you will never get anywhere.\"\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this anime to anyone.",

            "content": "Sukitte ii na yo (eng. Say \u201dI love you\u201d) had potential to be a blissful romantic drama - for the most part, it is. It nails many aspects of a good story which make up for its flawed plot. The best part of this show is the cast of characters: they are solid, varied and interesting. All of them have their upsides, downsides, flaws and rivalries.\r\nEven without an external plot, the emotional plot alone carries this show far. The animation is really sick too: The lines are sharp and everything from backgrounds to people is finely detailed. Both the guys and the girls are attractiveto the eye but not overtly sexy. I can't emphasize enough how much I liked the art \u2013 oh, and the music! Both the intro and the end theme are amazing and I loved hearing them every time.\\n\\n\r\nThe only problem with this show is its lack of a plot. Especially unnerving is how watered down the love triangles are. Every crisis is resolved way too easily, some of them almost instantly and without any actual developments. The good thing is, by the time you start feeling disappointed, you've already reached the ending. The strong points for this series are the characters who have tons of personality and historic background.\\n\\n\r\nThe show deals with plenty of social themes, mostly focused on the brutal side of social life, such as bullying, eating disorders, self-esteem issues, etc. These themes could've used far more in-depth exploration. I have not read the manga, but I get the feeling like most of my problems with this series are related to the hiccups which materialize when you adapt hundreds of pages of manga into 20-minute episodes.\\n\\n\r\nI love romantic fiction, but I also have a very personal beef with it. I know there are young people out there who build their ideas about relationships from fiction. The story of Romeo and Juliet is the perfect example of how retarded and self-destructive young love can be. I'm not saying people can't enjoy fantasies, but they need to recognize pandering bullshit. \"Sukitte ii na yo\" is smart because it avoids one of the grave sins of romantic fiction: Instead of falsely implying that lack of social skills makes you hot, the story actually digs into the theme of disparity in social stature and its effect on a relationship. The author clearly has an idea what she's doing and it\u00b4s too bad the story doesn't reach the heights it could have.\\n\\n\r\nI really hope that some day there will be a second season for \"Sukitte ii na yo\", because I definitely feel thirsty for more.",

            "content": "\"Having friends is the same as setting yourself up for a fall.\" - Someone probably.\r\nSukitte Ii na yo or Say \"I Love You.\" is an anime mainly about trying to manage a relationship with THE most popular dude in high school with you being the unpopular 'emo' girl, while at the same time is about making and sometimes find out what a true friend is. Now people have told me that, to be blunt, my reviews are sometimes a bit shit so I'm going to try a different formula and see how that goes.\r\nTHE GOOD: \r\nThe characters in this anime are great, and you reallyneed them to be because, this is a high school romance anime, if the characters are uninteresting or poorly done, no one is going to care when the drama rolls in to shake everything up. That being said the two key characters that you're going to be following for this entire anime are anything but uninteresting. First you have Mei Tachibana a social exile for lack of better wording, who, when she was in elementary school, was blamed for killing the class rabbit by her 'friends' and after that point she didn't make another friend until she ran into... or rather roundhouse kicked the most popular dude in her high school, one Yamoto Kurosawa, who, for some odd reason, is instantly interested in Mei right after she kicks him off a staircase. \\n\\n\r\nNow Mei might come off as a predetermined tsundere once she opens her mouth, but she's actually rather shy and timid. While Yamoto is the silver-tongued-suave-lady killer, who's loved for being a nice dude at school... and apparently he's handsome.... No comment. But because these two MC's are pretty much polar opposite it (at first) felt like Yamoto was a cat chasing after a ball of yarn, Mei being the yarn, but after the second episode you realize that, no, Yamoto does in fact what to be serious with Mei affirmed by the line, \"You are mine.\".... *Whispers* I think he's a dominatrix. On a side note, the characters as a collective actually talk like they're in high school, they talk about sex and porn and boobs as, you know, actual people do/would.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound design, for the voices, was done to what I've come to expect as standard really, no one had an annoying voice and no one felt let the person voicing them had just woken up and wanted to go back to sleep, it was fine. Standard. Par. Good Enough. Alrig- Okay I'll shut up now. The music and sound queuing on the other hand was a little bit better than standard, at least at the start, the constant cutting of piano with the rapid editing of the visual blended really well, and I'll admit I actually jump a little with the scene featuring the train in the first episode. So the sound was all-round solid, nothing else to mention really.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation didn't do anything to make me go, \"OMG MY EYES!!!!!\" in you, is was pretty much on level with the sound, on scene from the first episode sticks out because Mei was screaming and waving her hands around and the camera is solely focusing on her face and everything in the background is blurred instead of a standard shot where everything is in focus and still.\\n\\n\r\nTHE BAD:\\n\r\nThe thing that this anime arguably lacks, personally I think it just doesn't really need it, is a plot. You can argue that it's about Mei learning to trust people again, but really the only thing that's driving all the events is the relationship, not that there's anything wrong with that, it'd just be better if something else would be happening apart from the Mei/Yamoto relationship and the various dramas unfolding because of that.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that felt really forced by this show was the message of 'everyone is the same, regardless of what they seem like' and this show really beats you over the head with that, ALL of the named characters have some sort of emotional or physical scar from the past that they somehow tie to Mei. Somehow. this aspect might be realistic, because there isn't a person on this planet that doesn't have some sort of damage like that, and if you're that person whose reading this saying, \"Nah not me.\" 1.Bullshit 2.Wait a little longer, then get back to me.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that personally annoyed me just a little bit was the final episode, episode 13, you could've ended the anime on episode 12 and nothing would've changed, I feel like they had the project done, but then realized that they needed something to do with all the time they had left and someone just put up their hand and said, \"How about another episode?\" That guy then got promoted.\\n\\n\r\nTHE VERDICT:\\n\r\nSukitte Iinayo is a good anime, it's nothing outstanding, but it does it's job properly, it shows you what you came for and nothing really apart from that, no hidden meaning (FRIENDSHIP IS A LIE!!), and some pretty nice characters  that have normal conversations, instead of straight avoiding those blasphemous words and acting all embarrassed and innocent when someone hints at it. Say \"I Love You\" won't pry those words out of my mouth, but it will get me to take it to dinner and walk it home.\\n\\n\r\nGoodbye my brethren, see you in the next one.",

            "content": "In a world full of strangers, full of people who hate you, no matter which way you turn, you can't trust anyone. Even if you reach out to someone, they will only end up using you or simply outright betray you. \r\nSukitte Il Na Yo, or Say I Love You, builds upon that premise with an added twist: what if the first person you begin to trust is your first love? This is quite a daunting situation because trust, as well as listening to each other, and spending time together, is an important element to a healthy relationship. It is similar to being forced torun before learning how to walk. You just can't do it without knowing the first steps.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the situation that our main female character, Tachibana Mei, is in. Having been bullied and excluded by friends during her childhood, Mei has withdrawn herself into her own cocoon as she enters high school. One day, the most popular guy's friend, named Kenji, pulls Mei's skirt, provoking her. Extremely pissed off, she ends up roundhouse kicking Yamato, who is the most popular guy in the school. It seems that her kick struck a chord in Yamato and he ends up seeing Mei as a love interest. I can't speak for all guys but, to all girls out there, kicking us guys, if we don't know you, will probably not make us fall in love with you. Anyway, \"Say I Love You\" follows a pretty typical shoujo plot: girl has problems, girl meets prince, prince changes girl's life, girl falls in love with prince. But this is not an anime where they get together and head off into the sunset riding on a white horse at the end. In fact, Mei and Yamato get together very early in the anime. What this anime shows is how they come to understand each other while being in a relationship. The situations that the couple was placed in were very interesting, especially the first couple or so, because given Mei's lack of trust in general, you get to experience her emotional turmoil as she struggles to understand what it takes to be in a relationship. However, as the anime approached the end, the situations were falling more into the generic Shoujo situations of misunderstandings and the like.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the primary storyline of the anime is the relationship between Mei and Yamato, there are a few subplots running about, especially near the end. I had a little bit of a hard time figuring out how those plots tied into the main story but they tie into the bigger themes of bullying, trust, and friendship. I would say the anime does a good job of weaving these small stories into the anime without having them end up feeling like fillers. \\n\\n\r\nThere is a relatively large cast of characters and unfortunately, most side characters don't get much development. I would say Aiko and Asami get a gradual development over the course of the story while the others seemed to just get a quick exposition and no more development afterwards. This is not a bad thing since I am seeing Sukitte for the action between Mei and Yamato but at the same time, the side characters were pretty interesting people that I wanted to understand more. \\n\r\nAside from the side characters, our two main characters are pretty good. Out of the entire cast, Mei is my favourite. Mei starts off as a really insecure character but as she grows in the relationship and climbs out of her cocoon, she reveals herself as a really good and passionate person, and in my opinion, a great girl for any guy to have. Yamato is a decent guy. Like most other shoujo anime, he is a heartthrob who can claim a girl's heart simply by breathing. Although he can go overboard with his desire to help everyone, he loves Mei with all his heart. His development is mostly stagnant throughout the entire anime and he mostly serves as developing Mei's character.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork in Sukitte is very good. It takes a more realistic approach with, of course, the usual characteristics of a shoujo anime: long armed and tall guys and (much to a guy's dismay) flat-as-a-board female MC (anyone get the reference to another great shoujo anime?). The colour palette showcased dim, perhaps even washed-out, colours. I thought it complemented well to the relatively quiet nature of the entire anime. The animators deserve a lot of credit as they depicted the facial expressions of the characters very well. I recall in one scene where there was little dialogue but the facial expressions and body language effectively conveyed the tense and confusing atmosphere of the situation.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was well done as well. Although the soundtrack doesn't reach epic status, the music in each scene was well selected. I also enjoyed the relatively quiet OP as it complements Mei's personality and perhaps her relationship with Yamato as well. The voice actors also did a very good job. Mei's voice actor, Kayano Ai, was also the voice for Menma from AnoHana and Ibara from Hyouka while Yamato's voice actor, Sakurai Takahiro, was the voice for Matsuyuki from AnoHana (nice complement there), Suzaku from Code Geass, Jin from Sakurasou no Pet, and (for laughs) Tentomon from Digimon. Props to both of them for bringing great chemistry to Mei and Yamato.\\n\\n\r\nSay I Love You is a decent anime. It is not just a story about love but also about opening up to others. Sometimes, just putting yourself out there can do wonders. Definitely give this anime a watch if you are romance fan or looking for an anime where you see how the relationship develops throughout the course of the show (rather than simply seeing the couples get together at the end)!\\n\\n\r\nLet me know what you think of Sukitte Il Na Yo! I would love to hear from you!",

            "content": "Sadly, I didn't enjoy this anime at all.\r\nStory (3)\r\nI didn't find anything particularly interesting about the story, and sometimes it was ridiculously predictive. Just your typical high school setting, except that there was nothing interesting about it in the slightest.\r\nArt (7)\r\nI would say the art is the best thing about this anime, even though it's not really my type. It is quite beautiful at times, but it's nothing spectacular.\r\nSound (5)\r\nNot much to say here.\r\nCharacter (2)\r\nThe thing I find most exciting about television is the characters. When they're all complex and interesting, they're almost a family, and each has their own strengths and flaws, and whenyou want to get to know them. This anime had none of that. I didn't find any of the characters interesting at all, each were painfully stereotypical. The female lead was interesting to me in the first episode - she seemed shy, lonely yet strong - but after the first episode, she became extremely bland, and everything she did was frustrating and boring. The other character, her love interest seemed so over-\"perfect\" that it was annoying and uninteresting. Also, the way that he fell \"in love\" with her seemed ridiculous and rushed, and it made no sense to me. I found myself rolling my eyes throughout the entire show. Some of the side characters had interesting back stories though, but that's about all.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (3)\\n\r\nThe first episode was enjoyable, I can admit that. It showed a lot of potential and it got me interested, which is why I kept watching. Sadly, it just went downhill from there. I felt no emotion towards any of the characters. However, I stuck through the show in hopes of a decent ending, which never really came.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nThere's absolutely nothing fun about the plot, story, anything. Isn't love supposed to be enjoyable to watch? Not painstakingly boring and cringe worthy?  I wouldn't recommend it. I've seen plenty of other romance animes that are way more enjoyable than this one, with characters you can realistically relate to, or fall in love with all the same. Not this though. Sorry :(",

The only reason this anime was eye-catching was because of the artwork, IMO. \r\nHowever, I did enjoy the soundtrack. It matched the anime and feel of it. \r\nVery little character development. She was basically a loner, never doing anything or having any friends. He was a classical hot-popular guy with floods of girls who has asoft side for the mysterious girl who has painful self-esteem.

One can be overwhelmed by the ambition that this anime tries to achieve, however such stray from the norm can overwhelm the audience to weaken its premise as a memorable romcom.\r\nThe art and music is presented with emotion that heightens the story. The anime's ED features Suneohair, who has also made EDs from other romances such as Honey and Clover and Arakawa Under the Bridge. In addition, the voice cast works hand and glove with each other, conveying the character's feelings that feels fit towards each person. \r\nHaving said that, the character development is leftwith silly misunderstandings and overwhelming drama that depicts society as a dismal place to live in. The supporting cast's lack of depth and main heroin's constant troubles overcloud the story into becoming more fictitious and far-fetched that believable. All the running gags and complications of a romance are shown in full effect, and while other anime such as Seto no Hanayome can pull this off with ease, Sukitte Ii na yo falls short. This can leave the audience yearning for more depth with Kurosawa and Tachibana (the main characters), but also shows the inconsistencies this anime possesses.\\n\\n\r\nIn retrospect, sukitte Ii na yo provides a refreshing breath of the romcom genre with ambitious strives and leaps, however falls short with its lack of character development and its display of having a non-memorable storyline.",

            "content": "[STORY]\r\n-----------\r\nThe story of this anime was very interesting, especially the beginning. It really gave us a lot of tension between Tachibana and Kurosawa, and seeing Tachibana learn the ways of talking to other people and learning who her true friends were was very interesting. Although, the ending was a little bit disappointing to me. I for one rarely find anime endings that are ever good. I was hoping for something romantic in the last episode. \r\n[ART]\r\n-----------\r\nThe quality was very good and clear, so there isn't much to say about this topic, although the scenery was kind of bland. \r\n[SOUND]\r\n-----------\r\nI never watched the dubbed version ofthis anime (if there even is one), but the subbed version was fantastic! The voice actress for Tachibana really showed the character's emotions as being shy very well. Although, there wasn't much background music, and the opening and ending didn't really suit my style. Of course, this is only my opinion.\\n\\n\r\n[CHARACTER]\\n\r\n-----------\\n\r\nI for one really liked Tachibana, because she really reminds me of myself. She always looked shy and seemed to have social phobia as well. Both Tachibana and Kurosawa were great characters. As for the others, like Kitagawa, she was one of the characters that really annoyed me, but it was only because of the plot, so she had to fit in with the story, but she was a real.. well.. jerk?\\n\\n\r\n[ENJOYMENT]\\n\r\n-----------\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the beginning of the anime. Again, it brought a lot of tension between the two main characters, but the ending was a disappointment to me. I did watch the sequel (Sukitte Ii na yo.: Dareka ga), but it didn't really explain much about what happened. I guess most anime just like to end with something that wants the audience to be creative and imagine what happens next themselves. Not bad!\\n\\n\r\nFINAL SCORE: \\n\r\n7/10 because of a disappointing ending",

A very underrated anime, many people slate this anime but I believe if you're a fan of the romance genre you'll very much enjoy this and hence throughout this review I will tell you what the producers did well!\r\nPlease note due to the nature of this review I will reveal a very 'slight' spoiler, not of great importance and revealed about two episodes into the series anyway, however; please be cautious before reading on!\r\nStory - First of all, let's start with what I believe this anime did right in terms of its story line. As I'm sure you're aware mostromance anime show the two main protagonists slowly coming together near the end of the series. Unlike this, 'Sukitte Ii na yo' has the two main characters come together near the very start of the anime, thus showing how they develop as a couple rather than developing into a couple, this makes for a fun and new change of pace for romance genre lovers.\\n\\n\r\nArt - I was a great fan of the artwork, I believe in general there was great simplicity, though I found the portrayal of the characters was fantastic! The characters were drawn in a way that almost gave insight into their characteristics: shy; naive; confident or so on, almost allowing the audience to foreshadow later events.\\n\\n\r\nSound - I have little to comment on the sound other than, having personally watched the Dubbed version, the voice acting was strong and representative of the characters. I'm unaware what the original voice acting sounds like however.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter  - Naturally, in the genre of romance; characters are very important, especially when it comes to the main male and female protagonists. I want to avoid any further spoilers so will avoid telling of how these characters change the direction of the story, but will however comment on how their range of different characteristics allow the anime to have an edge, keeping the audience intent and interested with the story. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - I found great enjoyment within this anime and believe it has high 'rewatch' value, I was content with the ending and didn't feel the need for any further story. The anime truly ended on a good note whilst also providing fan service.\\n\\n\r\nLast notes - Let's end this review in a conclusive manner, is 'Sukitte Ii na yo' worth a watch in my own opinion? Yes, the anime excels its expectations, providing a chilled, fell good and more over a enjoyable experience!",

            "content": "I can't decide whether to praise or diss this anime. I could write a review gushing about how great it is, or a scalding one about it's downfalls. I'll do both.\r\nPros: \r\n-The romance itself is quite good. It's interesting to see the different sides of each other they bring out. They make one another less boring and have a truly touching love story, as sudden and maybe even forced as it was. They have heavy chemistry and you can understand why they love each other, even if seems that they fell in love rather fast.\r\n-That being said, Mei's character isn't your regular happy, cheerful, submissivegirl (well...), but she's interesting in that we can all relate to her pain and loneliness. She has had some tough experiences that were a bit dramatized and probably are...uncommon...but possible, and the pain she felt at being rejected by her classmates and being hurt over and over by her friends, is something we can all definitely relate to. \\n\r\n-There is no annoying waiting. The main love interest tells her he likes her quickly, and they don't take ages to get together, which is refreshing. They are also surprisingly honest with each other, which is nice to see and helps the romance come at a faster, better rate. \\n\r\n-The art is absolutely beautiful. \\n\r\n-The story is familiar, but it has some new elements that make it interesting and very unique. \\n\r\n-The romantic interest isn't a cold jerk to the girl for once. He is the cliche popular, rich, perfect player guy, but he is actually very kind, considerate and warm towards Mei, which is refreshing and interesting. \\n\r\n-They have a very balanced relationship. He is considerate towards her, and Mei is honest with him. There is no one person dominating the other. They have one of the healthiest relationships I've seen. \\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-The romance is good in terms of chemistry, but it happens way too suddenly, way too fast. You blink, and they're in love. He's nice to her, sure, but at the same time, she doesn't come off as the type to be so trusting and loving right away after all she's been though....\\n\r\n-Talking about Mei, she goes off character many times. She goes from a cold,  prickly girl to a moe, kawaii blushing cute girl in the span of four seconds. It's just uncharacteristic to change so fast. It's not character development, it's just conveniently changing her with no reason to make her cuter, more appealing, and better for the romance relationship. \\n\r\n-I can't stand the music, but some may, so I rated it average. \\n\r\n-The main male romantic interest is boring. I've seen him in nearly every shoujo anime - arrogant but kind, perfect, good at sports, good at academics, rich, popular, every girl loves him yet he chooses the loser girl, player....yeah. Been done before, and there's no development or even backstory for him. He's kind and a great boyfriend, but beyond that, very hollow, shallow character with little interesting things about him. \\n\r\n-A lot of the obstacles seem very forced, cliche, overdone and overdramatized. They take the smallest thing and blow it up to be some huge, mindblowing issue. It's just not that great story-wise. The plot is forced and kind of blind, despite some good themes it brings in.",

            "content": "I have a difficult time trying to comprehend Say \"I Love You\". On the one hand, it has some of the most realistic interactions and relationships between characters that I have ever seen, with characters able to talk about kissing and sex without getting kicked 10m across the room. On the other hand, taking advantage of a girl in the middle of the day by forcibly kissing her as a way of \"scaring away a stalker\" is considered perfectly acceptable. \r\nIt's kind of hard to fairly judge romance stories in anime. A lot of their basic premises are so similar, a lot of people willwrite them off as being \"clich\u00e9\" or \"unoriginal\". But what makes each individual romance story unique is its execution. Say \"I Love You\" attempts to break through the cage of unoriginality by presenting us viewers with characters that actually accept the fact that they love and care for each other. No big misunderstandings. No cockblocks. No elaborate schemes by side characters to bring the painfully obvious couple together. Just pure, unadulterated romance. The way it should be.\\n\\n\r\nDespite loving the realistic way the show presents itself at the beginning, I have some major complaints about some of the directions the plot decides to take and how certain events unfold. It left me feeling dissatisfied and, at times, a tad frustrated.\\n\\n\r\nIn the same vein that the story left me feeling dissatisfied, the main set of characters are a rather mixed bag as well. Tachibana Mei is your run-of-the-mill shoujo protagonist. She has no friends and looks and acts average in every way possible. A prefect slate for most of the show's viewers to place themselves into. Kurosawa Yamato, on the other hand, is your run-of-the-mill shoujo love interest. He has loads of friends and looks and acts cool in every way possible. A perfect character to have the show's viewers romanticise about. And thus a beautiful romance was born (?).\\n\\n\r\nJoking aside, the characters do have some quality to them. Tachibana's slow progression from having no friends to realising that she has people she can rely on is incredibly heartwarming, and the way that Kurosawa helps her achieve this is very cute. She is a very flawed person that can make you mad or even cringe at times, but that's just what makes her such a strong character. \\n\\n\r\nKurosawa is the opposite. His flaws aren't what make you angry, but instead, his supposed lack of flaws. His over-confidence and easy-going attitude make him, at times, detestable. However, he is not always awful. His devotion to Tachibana and his realisation of his (many) mistakes make up for his blandness.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the main characters' lost potential, it's hard to call either of them \"unlikeable\". I wish I could say the same about the supporting cast. Barely any of them are interesting in the slightest, and those that are don't get enough development to become anything memorable. It seems as though almost every character has bullied or has been bullied, and we should feel sorry for them either way. By the end, I didn't care for any of them (except maybe Kai).\\n\\n\r\nThe standout feature of Say \"I Love You\" has nothing to do with story or character but is instead its sound/art design. It may not be masterful, but they did a pretty fine job with the animation. Every character moves as they should do and nothing feels out of the ordinary. Both songs are excellent, despite being somewhat typical. And, the voice actors did a great job capturing the emotions of each character.\\n\\n\r\nSay \"I Love You\" is the exact same romance story you've seen hundreds of times over, but with the help of likeable protagonists, fantastic pacing and endearing relationships, it manages to stand head and shoulders above the flooded see of mediocrity and becomes something worth your time.\\n",

            "content": "Honestly, I loved this anime. It sure isn't the most original anime but it's wonderful in it's own way. \r\n Story: It's your typical popular boy falls for shy girl romance blooms. However this is probably one of the most realistic romances I've seen in a while. Mei falls for Yamato but that doesn't mean everything is perfect between them. She's still painfully shy around him and sometimes says things she doesn't mean because she doesn't know how else to react in that situation. Sure there's lots of clich\u00e9 jealousy but that happens in real life. There's just something so sweet about this couple youwant to keep watching more. \\n\\n\r\n Art: Not much to say, I really liked the animation of it. It's quite refreshing and smooth. It has clean lines and crisp colors. There's a watercolor-ish feel to the background as well. \\n\\n\r\n Music: The opening and ending songs are a bit annoying a first, but by the end of the anime I came to realize how nicely they fit in. Very sweet and slow. As far as the background music I thought it fit in nicely with the anime but nothing spectacular. \\n\\n\r\n Character: Mei, well at first she seems to fall into the Mary-sue trap but once you understand her character I think she's wonderful. She's very easy to relate to and root for and all her reactions to the situations are realistic. She's painfully shy at points but slowly begins to open herself up and make friends. Along the way convincing and helping other people as well. \\n\r\nYamato kind of comes off as cocky jerk. Which is true for the first couple of episodes. But you can tell he genuinely likes Mei and being in a relationship with her changes him. You can tell he's gotten all he's wanted all his life, and now he has to work to keep Mei. (Mei also has to work to keep him.) \\n\\n\r\n Enjoyment: I just really like this anime. It's by no means perfect but their relationship is so real. I came to genuinely care about the characters and when they cried I cried. The show also touches about a lot of important topics. Examples: How important is beauty, trusting people, bullying, how people view you, and most importantly being yourself. \\n\\n\r\n Overall: If you love romance then you'll love this show. There isn't much action but it's a sweet anime. I'd recommend giving it a shot.",

            "content": "Honestly, this show is the cringiest garbage I've ever seen. The dialogue is pulled straight from a 12 year old perverts fan fiction. \r\nHoweverrrr, I rated this show a 3 because despite the terrible characters, cringy dialogue, awful writing and ridiculous pacing it DOES have some positive aspects. \u201cSay \u2018i love you\u2019\u201d has some genuinely nice moments as well, It\u2019s just a shame that those moments are almost instantly ruined by something stupid happening. But because I am such an uplifting positive fella, i\u2019ll review the best parts of the show first.\r\nThe Music (7): \r\nEasily the best part of this show. The soundtrack has aslow, uplifting vibe which offers a similar ambience to actually good shows like Mushishi and the Aria series. Quite often the only background sounds are birds chirping or the sound of feet tapping on the sidewalk which honestly is pretty neat. The relaxing, feelgood vibes always set the ideal mood when entering scenes. The OP/EP are both excellent as well. Unfortunately it takes more than a good soundtrack to make a show any good, so it\u2019s all downhill from here im afraid ;)\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Art (4):\\n\r\n The art and animation isn't awful, I mean, it's not good either. The drawings are quite often noticeably bad, eyes pointing in weird directions, triangle boobs, literally a rectangle to draw someones entire body.. But for the most part it's not awful?\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (3): \\n\r\nLets start off with my least favorite character, Yamato.. His literal only character traits is that he is popular, good looking, creepy, hypocritical, self centered, probably even a sociopath.. oh an he's kind, sometimes? Almost half the show is about him pressuring Mei into sexual favors all the while claiming the opposite. \"lets take this slow\" as he forces himself onto her whilst just assuming she wants it \"cuz im popular, duh\". Later in the show he shows himself up to be one of the more hypocritical characters i've seen in anime, all to add a lil bit o' that drama. \\n\\n\r\nNext up we have Mei Tachibana. Her character in the first few episodes was actually the one redeeming quality about the show. She had integrity, was honest, had her own character (as raw as it was). Unfortunately her character actually regresses and loses personality the further into the show you go. Take note all, if you get a BF you're supposed to have your entire life revolve around him and lose all of your character traits so you are a literal walking drama-doll. If he talks to another girl? DRAMA! If he forgets to text you? DRAMA! If he doesn't show up to school because he's sick. OH SHIT, DRAAAMAAAAA!! \\n\\n\r\nthe other two main characters (Yamatos childhood friends/GF) show up out of nowhere.. Guess what their entire purpose for being there is? Yep, DRAMACLOCK. Sadly, these two characters are probably the MOST DEVELOPED CHARACTERS IN THE ENTIRE SHOW.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory (3): ehh.. I think my character discussion kind of explained the entire stories structure. The end goal is accomplished in the first two episodes, the rest of the show is just adding unneeded melodrama in order to \"develop\" their relationship. \\n\\n\r\nFortunately there are some genuinely well written moments in this show. There will be moments you feel bad for characters, feel pity for them, even feel like you understand them. \\n\r\nUnfortunately those moments are very few and far between.\\n\\n\r\nDialogue (2):\\n\r\nJesus, where to start.. This show has the worst dialogue I have ever seen. I'm not even joking. Na you know what, the dialogue is the best part of the show. It gives you something to laugh at. \\n\\n\r\nThere you have it, fellas. \"say 'i love you'\", A modern masterpiece. I highly recommend this show to everyone. \\n",

            "content": "A mediocre tale written about a mediocre girl who falls in love with a mediocre guy, how cute. \r\nSay I Love You is the story about a girl who is never noticed falling in love with a guy that everyone noticed. In other words, it is the even more basic version of every high school drama series ever created. \r\nStory: 4\r\nThe storyline isn't the worst and at times it comes off as quite adorable. It is also a storyline that many of us can relate to, if you were the kind of kid who was never popular in high school. \r\nBasically, Mei (female protagonist) isa very antisocial girl who decides not to make anymore friends in high school. That all changes one day when she finally meets this guy, whom for some reason she has never seen before despite them going to a high school where everyone knows everyone, and he changes her outlook on social activity. Hooray!\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe art is the only really good thing in this show. The characters are drawn well and everything looks very calmly and peaceful, which sets the mood for this kind of series. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nThe music is nice and the overall sound is very appealing. However, it is still not all that unique comparitively speaking. Voice acting matched the characters well,  but nothing special enough for me to write about. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 2.8\\n\r\nThe characters, all of them, are completely stagnant and poorly developed.\\n\\n\r\nFirst you have Mei, which we all know to be antisocial, but I mean she could have at least tried harder in life. I watched the entire 13 episodes hoping I would watch her blossom into this mature woman, but nooooooo. She is beyond passive, and despite gaining a bit more confidence she still has the same mediocre tone to her personality.\\n\\n\r\nThen you have Yamato, the king of \"marty stues\". He is not only the best looking guy in the world, but he has messed around with every single girl he's met yet manages to still treat them with respect. Aw, how thoughtful of him to treat a human being like a human being, that must mean he is the most absolute perfect boyfriend in the world.\\n\r\nThe writers are trying to fool you into thinking he is this perfect guy, but he is completely docile and clueless when it comes to the poor behavior of himself or the people around him. And sure, he is a good boyfriend (at one point) to Mei, but you quickly realize he lacks the perfect qualities you are fooled into believe he has. However, it is still played off as if he can do no wrong and it makes the entire theme feel completely phony.\\n\\n\r\nThen you have everyone else, who is either beautiful and stupid or beautiful and rude. Either way, you are forced to believe that beautiful people cannot have bland personalities, that's for ugly people. I mean, this is why Mei is ugly, right? *rolls eyes*\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4\\n\r\nSome of the scenes were very adorable to watch, and it is nice to watch shows where someone makes friends and their bond grows stronger. However, the entire series feels so fake when it comes to those strong bonds of love and friendship. \\n\r\nAll of Mei's friends are still better friends with Yamato, and they truly behave in the way of putting Yamato before her. She doesn't define her relationship and she never defines her relationship, Yamato is their relationship. This makes the series very frustrating to watch, especially since none of the characters really improve in terms of quality.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3.9\\n\r\nWelp, it's not the worst anime I have ever seen...\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

The characters were well development and each of them were very different in their own way.\r\nThe only thing that I didn't like was how fast everything went. I feel like the situations were fixed up really quickly in one episode. It could have extended throughout the series with fewer problems.

Honestly, this isn't about real love...it's more about finding yourself and where you fit in society which in this case is high school. I think everyone will love this anime as we all were once the awkward, unsociable girl/guy...so it is relatable. \r\nArt-9/10\r\nI actually loved it...the male characters were weirdly attractive and of course the animation was interesting in every episode. \r\nSounds-7/10\r\nIt was cutely cheesy...the theme song was beautiful and colorful at the same time. Ironic because the main femalecharacter is anything but colorful.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter-8/10\\n\\n\r\nYamato's character was astonishing as he broke the stereotypical pretty boy story we expect. As this character showed us that everyone has problems despite their appearance and status...which was refreshing. Also, Mei wasn't the typical beautiful heroin...she was quite the opposite: insecure, pessimistic and ordinary. Thus the character development was beautiful as you would see how each of them grow due to the influence of the other so I liked it. \\n\\n\r\nRelationship 4/10- This part I did not like...13 episodes and you already love each other?! Come on. I just felt it was very fantastical and compared to the characters it was a let down and way too far illogical. Furthermore, their 'love' for each had so many holes you had to cringe-the bad communications, secrets and the short months they have actually had a serious 'relationship'. I just couldn't see the genuine love there...yes crush but not the sacred word love. No way. Itazura na kiss feels like heaven comparing the love. \\n\\n\r\nOverall-6/10\\n\r\nIt was a great anime but I wouldn't rewatch it like I do with Itazura na Kiss. As it felt like a slice of life and two people trying to find their identity and place in society.      \\n",

THE LOVE IS REAL AND IMPRESSIONABLE, YOU WILL FALL IN LOVE WITH THIS ANIME, AND HAVE NO IDEA WHY. \r\nITS THAT AMAZING. \r\nwow. First review I've ever written, and this anime just took my breath away, while warming my heart at the same time. Its SO good that I can't think of a better way of spending my time. I really don't know why it's so good, it's a typical shouja... But I can't stop thinking about this anime. The story itself just leavesme thinking, and thinking, whats so special about it. But I think it's a must see, because the number 1 thing I noticed about this anime is that it makes me HAPPY.   its whimsical, funny and cute, its easy to follow, and fall deep into , it makes you believe that this love is possible. in only 13 episodes, i got attached and hooked, it was always just the right tempo. It makes you love there love, because it's real, id make the same decisions the lead character mei did, this anime just leaves you with the biggest impression, that will stay with you for a long time. Its a classic in its genre, I really recommend it if you've given up hope on unrealistic love, be prepared to regain faith, + be prepared to melt away by yamato's actions like I did.",

As an Aro/Ace person, I couldn't really relate to this story. Usually if you like an anime you have some sort of connection. On this, I didn't.\r\nNow, some of the reasons I disliked this anime.\r\n1. It made me seem even lonelier.\r\nNow, that I actually thought about it, the reason is really quite stupid. In the story it shows the main protagonist who has no friends, find love. For me, I believe that not everyone willexperience romantic love, and with this reason, watching this anime, made me feel WAY lonelier by watching a two-dimensional character find actual love, unlike in my three-dimensional world.\\n\\n\r\n2. I thought it was quite clich\u00e9.\\n\r\nI'm not really one for clich\u00e9 anime. Especially clich\u00e9 love stories. And for me, I thought this anime fell perfectly into that category.\\n\\n\r\n3. I hated the dude.\\n\r\nWow, what a reason. No, really, I absolutely hated him. I thought everything he said, and did was dumb. I mean, come on, he was about to bang her, IN HER OWN HOUSE. No. Just no.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI understand most people really liked this anime. I have nothing against that, it's just I happen to be one who didn't quite enjoy it.",

Yamoto has development as well I think, he learns to be more trusting (especially towards Mei and his friends), and learns to not be too nice and stand up for people. The other characters such as the model (which name I forgot cause honestly I didn't really like her too much), Aiko-san , and Asami (if im right). The model learns to not do things for others but for herself. ( im spacing out for aiko and asamis development )\\n\\n\r\nI don't remember too much of the sound except for the opening which I thought was beautiful but simple since it was soft to the ear (if that makes sense)\\n\\n\r\nThe art was pretty good to me, it kind of reminded me of the artwork from the anime Orange (which I loved)\\n\\n\r\nI personally really enjoyed this romance anime, It made me cry so many times I lost count. I empathized with Mei a lot and rooted for her. I could binge watch these episodes but cautiously because I knew there weren't many and I liked it that much. If you read this I apologize for how bad it was but thank you for reading.",

It didn\u2019t really make sense to me why she would like him. \r\nHowever, after those initial episodes he\u2019s quite different and likeable enough at least. My main complaint is that the first handful of episodes are not consistent with it\u2019s tone and the show feels kinda seedy but then shifts into feeling like a matureconsistent shoujo romance anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is very similiar to Kimi ni Todoke in that there are even characters that are basically the same roles. Except this show is played more straight with less comedy. It\u2019s a slightly more mature show overall. The nasty characters are nastier and the demons everyone carries are lot more mature than KnT.\\n\\n\r\nMei is a cool main character. She is comparable to Sawako of KnT in that she\u2019s a shy socially inept girl brought out of her shell by her love interest. But they\u2019re different. Sawako\u2019s struggle with social interactions stems from everyone misunderstanding her for a long time. Mei hates everybody, she doesn\u2019t trust anybody. And is reluctant to accept Yamato's friendship.\\n\r\n In some ways I appreciate Mei more. She feels more real than Sawako, however, comparatively Sukitte Ii Na yo is a more serious romance to KnT a comedy romance.\\n\\n\r\nThe story wraps up fine. I was satisfied with it. I was pretty satisfied with Megu\u2019s story arc especially. I think every backstory was interesting except Yamato\u2019s, I didn\u2019t really care but it was also told during the moment of inconsistency so.\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t know if I can recommend it based on those first few episodes though because i can totally see people just dropping it. If you\u2019re willing to tough out the weird seediness in the first few episodes that disappears you might enjoy it. But overall I think Kimi ni Todoke is a more enjoyable iteration of a similar story. So unless you finish Kimi ni Todoke and really want a similar premise, just watch Kimi ni Todoke.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019d probably rate the show a 5 in the first few epsiodes and then a 7 when the consistency kicks in.",

            "content": "Alright... like all of you that have watched and completed this show, I bet you thought to yourself, \"Why is this anime so good?\". I pondered that in my mind for about 3 hours before finally realizing the answer:\r\nIt's the most realistic romance anime you can find out there.\r\nSome of you probably have different reasons why you love the show, but that was what I came up with. You have tons of romance animes out there, such as \"A Bridge to the Starry Skies\", \"The Rose Madder Colored Hills\", even \"The Future Diary\" can be considered a romance in it's own way... the problem withall of them, they seem fairly unrealistic. I doubt anyone in the world had to go through picking one girl out of an entire group of girls that loves him, picking either your fiance or your sister, or finding out your girlfriend is a sociopathic murderer in a challenge to become God.\\n\\n\r\nNow we turn to Say I Love You. It's how a lot of real romances go, the couple date, they kiss, they declare their love for one another. That's pretty much this show in a nutshell. For all we know, this might even be inspired by a true story. Might.\\n\\n\r\nFor a story, it was good. It wasn't entirely original, but there were moments in the show that got me wanting to know what happens next. A lot of shows revolve around some mini stories and one big story. This show pretty much only had one main story with the exception of one mini story, which kind of tied in with the main story, so if you're following me, there was only the main story. So as I was saying about it being slightly unoriginal, it's basically a Guy-Meets-Girl plot line. Luckily I liked the show because it was one of the better Guy-Meets-Girl stories.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork, good. I liked the character's designs, especially Mei. She seems pretty average looking, but the artist made something about her make me like her a lot. Other characters were well drawn, but there were some exceptions, like Kai's character art. First of all, no offense to those who like his style, I'm not the biggest fan of mohawks, nor male earrings. It makes him look a lot like a punk rocker. Then there were the \"mean girls\" of the show. They try to look \"fabulous\" by putting on tons of makeup and stylish clothes, and in the end, they make them look scary. I mean like \"I wanna punch them in the face\" scary. Those are the only problems I had with the artwork though. I liked the backdrops, most of the character art, and it just gave me a real image of what Japan looks like.\\n\\n\r\nSound, voices were good. They weren't extraordinary, but the voice actors did their roles well. Don't have any negative comments about any of them, I just think they sounded pretty average.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters, 9. I loved all of the characters. Despite the fact Kai had a mohawk and piercings, I still liked him. None of the characters made me grow a hatred towards them, except for the mean makeup wearing freakshows, so I was satisfied with that. I thought, \"Finally, there isn't really a villain in the show\". Mains were all cool, I liked their personalities, and Mei and Yamato make a great couple. I dig the whole Tall x Short thing going on between them.\\n\\n\r\nI can say that I really enjoyed the show. A little unsatisfied with the ending of the show, I feel like they could have done so much more with it, like make a really good finale, but the rest of the show made up for it. It had a few good laughs, a well thought out vision of what would come next... overall it was a really good anime. For those of you who like romance animes, this is definitely something you want to watch. It gives you a real taste in what romance is like in the real world. I hope this review helped.",

            "content": "I'll split my review in six parts, talking about all the features the app offers. \r\nStory: \r\nSukitte Ii Na yo is the typical cliche romance anime, but the interesting fact about it is that treats some issues that I've never seen before in this kind of anime. To say it somehow is more realistic. The anime does not focus much on how the main characters get to know each other, it's based on their actual relationship as a couple. This allows the serie to talk about some subjects that will make you feel identified with the characters, and remember some moments you might have beentrough with your romance partners. \\n\r\nThe story itself doesn't follow a guideline with some conclusive final, it's more based on the characters daily life experiences and their own development. For that reason this anime is risky because this may cause the story to be boring somehow, but this is not the case. The anime goes by fast, and it's very dynamic, they use the appereance of new characters and also some details introduced at some point in the series to get you hooked. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is good, accurate details, nice landscapes, but nothing special. The anime itself is simple to make compared to others such as Shingeki No Kyojin, for that reason I'll give it an 8/10. \\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\\n\r\nOpening and ending are great. OST is good, it suits the kind of story, and it's appropiate I'd say. Then again, it's not anything special, it won't make you wake up from your sit or anything. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are well-rounded, every single one has his own single personality, and they also have some development. Having in mind the lenght of the series I think the development is actually great. I also liked how they presented the background of every single character that's significant for the story development.\\n\\n\r\nOverall/Enjoyment\\n\\n\r\nMy rating is based on my own personal enjoyment, and for that I'll give a 9/10. I would suggest this anime to any Shoujo lovers, or to someone who just wants to watch a short/chillout anime.",

            "content": "We all remember our first love.  It happened in high School for most of us, middle school for a few of us, and much later in life for those of us who were less fortunate.  It was that shy, awkward time in our lives when our hormones were raging, our need for intimate one-on-one companionship was impossible to ignore, and after putting forth more and more effort until it felt like we were just screaming our ears off into a dark abyss, we finally managed to convince the object of our desires to invest some time in us.  Well, that, or youwere the one being persuaded, and you eventually gave in and relented, but either way, we finally found somebody that we could call our own...  Somebody we could say was ours, to spend all of our free time with, all while people gossiped behind us about what may or may not be going on behind closed doors.  For the first time, we found somebody that we wanted to do all of that mushy stuff that grossed us out when we were children with.  We were finally one half of a couple.  You never forget something like that.\\n\\n\r\nFor Mei Tachibana, first love isn\u2019t the subject of nostalgia...  It\u2019s coming for her, and it\u2019s coming hard.  While she was used to spending time by herself, avoiding all of those phony, blood-sucking, backstabbing social circles who have burned her before.  With no interest in impressing anyone, Mei retreated into the background, not wanting to attract any attention to herself...  Which, ironically, attracts the attention of Yamato Kurosawa, the most attractive and infamous boy in school.  Having fallen in love with her at first sight, Yamato will stop at nothing to make her his, even while admirers, a former flame, a famous model, and even his own little sister try to compete with her for his attention.  She is of course attracted to him as well, but how can she let down her defenses for him, when she\u2019s been hurt before?  How can she give herself over to someone, to trust him as he trusts her, when she has no idea what his intentions are, or what a plain, ordinary girl like her can possibly offer someone as perfect as him?  Oh, what\u2019s a troubled young girl from Forks...  Um, I mean, Japan, to do?\\n\\n\r\nSay I Love You was animated by a company named ZEXCS, which is apparently pronounced like Zekushizu.  I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever come across that name before, but they were also partially behind the production of Diabolik Lovers, so I must have.  Taking a closer look at it\u2019s history, it was apparently formed by a former JC Staff producer, and yeah, now I\u2019m starting to put this company into context.  The work that I\u2019ve seen from JC Staff have been wildly varying in terms of quality, but I\u2019m kind of surprised to say that in this case, we have a title that\u2019s wildly varying in quality all by itself.  Say I Love You was clearly a low budget series, as evidenced by the plethora of shots where people are frozen in the background like mannequins, stuck in time in the middle of their conversations, but it overall isn\u2019t bad looking animation, either.  Thankfully, this kind of show doesn\u2019t need to be heavy on movement, as a lot of it\u2019s story is told through inner monologue and long wistful stares, so the constant dips in budget don\u2019t ever get too distracting.\\n\\n\r\nWell, I say that, but the material they may have wasted a bit too much on is also present more than a few times.  That\u2019s not to say saving money for the sake of scenes that require more movement is a bad thing, but the frozen backgrounds become a bit less forgivable when you\u2019ve got money to waste on pointless shots like animations of children running at a distance as well as other similarly blurry, shaky-cam looking shots that I\u2019m still not sure what they were trying to do with.  Like I said, though, this isn\u2019t a genre that really needs to be told through a lot of movement,and considering how fluid the little movement it has actually is, this show actually looks slightly above average compared to others of it\u2019s ilk.  They put a lot of effort into making basic motions and interactions such as minor scuffles and walk cycles look realistic, even if characters freeze a bit too often when they\u2019re talking to each other.  Aside from the few key visual tropes of a shoujo anime, character designs skew towards realism, and while the backgrounds are adequate overall, there are brief moments where the artwork and lighting are so beautiful that you might actually forget the few nagging budget issues.\\n\\n\r\nThe music for the series has a very pleasant tone to it, as do most Shoujo based soundtracks, but this particular composition by Yuuji Nomi just had that little extra bit of effort and diversity behind it.  Some of the tunes are a bit loopy, and can become annoying when played on endless repeat in the background of scenes where nothing\u2019s really going on, but the ones with actual purpose and intentions behind them are kinda genius, using a number of different instruments to bring a soft, melodramatic feel to the story.  From the xylophone to the violin, every note is played with the right atmospheric pace, with vibrations in all the right places to convey the wavering hearts of the cast.  Unfortunately, the opening theme Friendship by Okazaki Ritsuko, is a bit more on the generic side.  If you\u2019re heard a shoujo opening song before, then you\u2019ve heard the one, which honestly just feels like a bland version of the op from Fruits Basket.  It\u2019s not necessarily bad, per se, but you won\u2019t miss anything by skipping it, and the same goes for the ending.\\n\\n\r\nLikewise, the English dub isn\u2019t bad, but it\u2019s really kind of unremarkable, as it mostly just goes through the motions.  honestly, they didn\u2019t even bother matching the lip flaps in a lot of scenes.  Actors Greg Ayres and Monica rial, who should have been breaths of fresh air in any dub they\u2019re in, play disappointingly close to their most common typecastings, with Ayres playing the pervy girl-crazy best friend, and Monica playing the likeable, bubbly best friend.  The same could be said for Andrew Love, who once again plays a somewhat dimwitted tough guy role, but since he gets misused a lot easier than those other two, I\u2019ll just consider his playing to type a good thing.  If there\u2019s an especially sour note among the cast, it\u2019s Leraldo Anzaldua, who I\u2019ve never been a particular fan of, and they gave him the lead role.  His approach to the character seems to almost be inspired by Robert Pattinson\u2019s approach to Edward Cullen...  Play him as you see him, even if that interpretation is a negative one, and Leraldo plays Yamato like a wet rag with all the personality and enthusiasm you\u2019d expect if Shyamalan was directing him.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a few beaming lights, though...  Caitlynn French does a way better job with Mei Tachibana than the role actually required, all while giving just as honest a portrayal as Leraldo gave.  She plays the role as sometimes bitchy, sometimes preachy, while never becoming unlikeable in either tone, and she even made her character\u2019s depression feel a lot more crushing than the original Japanese seiyuu did.  There are some lines she had to speak in this show that were downright uncomfortable, and probably not by design, and she still did surprisingly well with them.  Emily Neves was also a gem as the snooty, duplicitous Megumi, and while that\u2019s not really a surprise as she\u2019s always been a bit of a chameleon, you don\u2019t really get the full effect of it until she breaks down towards the end of the series.  Oh, Brittany Karbowski and Tiffany Grant also get small parts in this, and while that alone should be a selling point, they\u2019re roles are limited, both in time and in content.  I can\u2019t really condemn the dub, as there are a few really good performances in it, but I feel like if I\u2019m being honest, I\u2019ve gotta recommend the sub.\\n\\n\r\nYou know, I\u2019m not immune to the charms of a good shoujo anime.  I really don\u2019t think anyone is, even if they protest that fact.  They\u2019re like anime chick flicks...  Sometimes, even hardcore action and gore fans need to sit down for a feel-good viewing of The Princess Bride.  Likewise, I\u2019ve yet to meet an anime fan that didn\u2019t enjoy Princess Tutu and Ouran High School host club, and while those two shows do deliberately contain a lot of dual appeal, I don\u2019t really mind the more stereotypically shoujo anime, either.  I liked Fruits Basket.  I love Ikuhara\u2019s work.  Those of you who remember my Vampire Knight review will know that I consider the first season to be a major guilty pleasure.  I don\u2019t mind the giant eyed heroines with absurdly rendered pupils and eyelashes.  I don\u2019t mind skinny bishounen makes with haircuts that are ultimately dated because they\u2019re based on whatever\u2019s popular at the time.  I\u2019ve got nothing against the genre or it\u2019s tropes, so I don\u2019t want you to think I\u2019m biased when I say that my first time watching this series, almost exactly one year ago, I dropped it after three episodes.\\n\\n\r\nBefore I get intro why, let\u2019s go over some of the more persistent problems hiding right in plain sight just beneath it\u2019s flowery surface.  Starting with the main character, Mei Taniguchi, we\u2019re told early on that she\u2019s not like other girls.  She\u2019s not like the gossipy girls who play social games for their own benefit, and she\u2019s also not like the girls who alter their natural appearances to impress guys.  Okay, we know what she\u2019s not, but what is she?  We know she has a tragic backstory where some rotten kids blamed her for something they did wrong, and that\u2019s caused her to become distant and bitter even several years later, and we know that she\u2019s honest, and occasionally has wisdom to offer people, but aside from all that, I\u2019ve gotta be honest, she\u2019s kind of boring.  She\u2019s a textbook Mary-sue character, who\u2019s only real flaws are her shy nature and mistrust of others, and she doesn\u2019t do a whole lot to solve these problems.  Other people do.  Hell, she rarely ever makes progressive or active choices as a protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nAnd her boyfriend Yamato Kurosawa is even worse.  This isn\u2019t really my biggest problem with him, but his biggest problem is objectively the fact that he\u2019s so damned inconsistent.  There are a ton of examples I can bring up, but I feel like one of te most obvious is when we find out that he\u2019s not a virgin.  It\u2019s explained to us that it\u2019s because he\u2019s really selfless and kind, and he slept with a girl because she made him think it would make him happy.  Well, this happened in the same episode that he invited himself along on Mei\u2019s trip to the salon to get her hair cut, but he immediately hijacked her plans in order to take her out on an abrupt date.  She misses the salon, upon which he says that he likes her with long hair.  Oh, NOW you have an opinion?  Your pants fly off because a girl asks for your dick, and you\u2019re totally a martyr, but when a girl thinks her hair is getting too frizzy to manage, THAT\u2019s something you\u2019ll voice your opposition to?  When it comes to character development, actions speak louder than words, and his actions in this case just felt controlling and manipulative.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that\u2019s not even him at his worst.  People often give him shit for kissing Mei without permission in order to get rid of her stalker...  Which, while effective and somewhat excusable, feels a bit overkill.  As a wise red dragon once said, never play an ace if a 2 will do...  They seem to forget that in the same episode as the salon incident, towards the end, he catches her hiding and watching him, and takes the opportunity to kiss her without permission again, ultimately pinning her against a wall and kissing her into submission.  If she hadn\u2019t been receptive to that, she could have had him behind bars for sexual assault.  He ditches her for hours in the middle of a date because his friend had something to give him, he went over to another girl\u2019s house for weeks after school without telling Mei, and he doesn\u2019t even make a habit of asking her what she wants to do until the final third of the story...  Up until then, it\u2019s always \u201cLet\u2019s do this,\u201d or \u201cYou should...\u201d  I am honestly convinced that the anime adaptation skipped over some info dump about him suffering some kind of brain damage as a child, to explain the way he behaves throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nSee, this isn\u2019t just a shoujo romance series.  It\u2019s something far more insidious.  It\u2019s a self insert wish fulfillment fantasy boyfriend series.  Mei isn\u2019t supposed to be an interesting character, she\u2019s supposed to be a blank slate for the audience and presumably the writer to imprint themselves onto, so that they can live out the experience of having a popular, handsome boy getting all up in their business.  Yamato isn\u2019t supposed to be an interesting character either, he\u2019s supposed to be an unobtainable dreamboat who only has eyes for the main character, much to the dismay of, like, oh my god, the entire school.  It\u2019s like Twilight without the sparkling vampires, or 50 Shades of Grey without the BDSM and torture devices.  Hell, the only torturing device involved was my own DVD player.  Don\u2019t get me wrong dudes are guilty of this too...  We tend to get a lot of stories that depict us as badass loners who get bothered by sexy girls who fight with us but eventually succumb to our awesomeness through no real change of our own, like Steins;Gate and Sword Art Online, but Say I Love you takes this concept to a special new low, because I have a very specific person in mind who might be dreaming it up.\\n\\n\r\nJust for fun, I\u2019d like you to imagine Tomoko from Watamote...  Yes, we\u2019re really doing this...  Alone in her room, bitching about the people in her life, when all of a sudden she\u2019s like \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be awesome if the most popular boy in school fell in love with me?  That would show all of those losers.  He\u2019d be obsessed with me, and it would be because I\u2019m different.  I\u2019m not like all of those back stabbing bitches, or those tramps who slather on gallons of make-up to whore themselves out to boys.  He\u2019ll fall in love with me at first sight, and he wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer.  I\u2019m not easy, though, so I\u2019d play hard to get, and he\u2019d come at me kind of rough, but that\u2019s okay, because we both know we\u2019re going to be together forever!  He\u2019d even turn down a model for me...  no, wait, he IS a model!  Oh shit, I\u2019d better write this down!  I can make a manga out of this!\u201d  And then after two hours of brainstorming, she\u2019s like \u201cOoh, and then his friend comes back, and he totally falls in love with me because we like the same theme park, and they\u2019d totally fight over me!  Oh, and we get a hotel room, and...  Nope, gotta think of my demographic.  nothing happens at the hotel because he respects me, and while he\u2019s more experienced than me, none of what he\u2019s done before me matters, because none of it involved me!\u201d\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s mindlessly self-indulgent right down to the fact that backstabbing classmates are used as a constant source of antagonism, as well as being basically what every named antagonists\u2019 backstory boils down to, and no attempt is ever made to humanize them.  They come close to it as part of Megumi\u2019s backstory, when they abandon her in favor of someone she refused to invite, but even then, the abrupt decision and hive mind element to the scene make no sense.  Actually, there\u2019s a lot of occurrences in this anime that make no sense, from Mei and Yamato leaving a festival early all because they\u2019re friends decided to go home(They seriously wouldn\u2019t take the opportunity to be alone?), to Yamato\u2019s creepy relationship with his sister, who he seems to act as both the parent and the crush of, to how easily Megumi comes undone over her inability to ensnare Yamato, even though she literally just decided out of the blue that she wanted to date him based on his looks.  The tragic part is that she\u2019s clearly a rip off of Ami from Toradora, who was a much better written and explored character.\\n\\n\r\nEarlier in this review, I referred to the relationship between Mei and Yamato as their first love, and I did so for a specific reason...  It was my attempt at gently stating that, in all likelihood, it won\u2019t be their last.  Not only are such romances doomed to fail in real life, but the one between them isn\u2019t even based on a solid foundation.  Yamato\u2019s love for Mei was decided and settled upon based entirely on his first impression of her, and he doesn\u2019t even bother getting to know her before imprinting on her.  Outside of his good looks, I can\u2019t see what Mei sees in him, outside of his persistence and refusal to give up on her.  Their love, respectively, is superficial and circumstantial.  He didn\u2019t even open her up to other people, like she claims...  Once he picked her, other people came to her out of curiosity, through no effort of his own.  In their own mutually exclusive ways, these two characters don\u2019t even know what love is, and eventually, I can\u2019t help but get the feeling that their relationship is destined to end with tears and heartbreak, with the school\u2019s new power couple splitting up, and honestly?  I\u2019m okay with that.\\n\\n\r\nWith most high school anime romances, even the bad ones, you\u2019re given a sense of purpose in the two of them staying together...  Even in a shitshow like Clannad, where I wanted Tomoya to get remarried after his wife died, he was still destined to marry Nagisa before anybody else, as their emotional codependency formed too intense a connection to break.  In the Love Hina manga, we get to see over time how the spineless dumb-ass Keitaro was able to win Naru\u2019s heart.  In a good show like Toradora, you know enough about Ryuji and Taiga\u2019s friendship and backgrounds that we know they don\u2019t make sense with anybody else.  In Say I Love You, I didn\u2019t get a sense of any of that.  If they were to break up, with Yamato dating Megumi and Mei winding up with Kai, those relationships wouldn\u2019t necessarily last forever either, but it wouldn\u2019t feel like some major tragedy...  It would just feel like \u201cAh, part 2 of the story!\u201d  And yeah, with this being the worst case scenario, the series lacks any real stakes, making it kind of tedious to get through.  Honestly, the final episode was a joke, with the two of them being separated by a series of phone tag related coincidences.  Yawn.\\n\\n\r\nSay I Love You is available from Section23 films both on Bluray and DVD, and can also be viewed on Crunchyroll.  The original manga by Kanae Hazuki is available stateside from Kodansha comics, and the live action film is apparently not available in the US, but from what I\u2019ve heard that\u2019s not such a bad thing as even fans of the anime and manga find it soulless and bland.\\n\\n\r\nMuch like the shoujo genre, I really don\u2019t have anything against melodrama, but there\u2019s a much clearer distinction to be made with that material...  Melodrama tends to work best when it\u2019s self aware.  Anime like Bento and so many shoujo titles outside of this one were written by people who knew that the stories they were writing didn\u2019t measure up to much in terms of stakes, so they compensated by amping up the emotions, infusing character development into the plot, and using themes to add flavor to what was going on.  Say I Love You tries to do this, with a breaking bracelet symbolizing a broken heart, and cats getting along when their owners do, but for the most part, it does the bare minimum, creating a bad romance between two 2-dimensional characters that has no reason or power to stand the test of time.  The music and the animation are above average, and to be fair, Mei and Yamato do become a lot more tolerable of a couple in the final third when Mei starts to show a bit more initiative and Yamato starts to treat her more like a person, but I think a romance where the guy sounds ten times happier about his new kitten than about his new girlfriend leaves a lot to be desired.  I give Say I Love You a 3/10.",

Well whatever.. I really liked how the character's faces were designed especially Mei's face. \\n\r\nThe rest of the art was good too, nice backgrounds, but well, nothing out of the ordinary so 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound 6.5/10\\n\r\nI thought the opening was quite good considering the kind of anime it was, but it was far from being great either. The ending was just okay. Overall OSTs in this mangaare not extraordinary except for one near the end, I can't get you the name, but the situation it was used in and the OST itself is just an exceptional combination! That moment really was great thanks to the OST.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10\\n\r\nWell character development is okey. I really liked how some characters were develloped such as Mei and Kai mostly, these \u00e9 characters are the most lovable characters in this anime and each has a story which can really touch people's heart depending on your background.\\n\r\nMegumi was a quite well develloped character too, but it seems like the watcher wil not necessarily like her so it's hard to put ourselves in her place.\\n\r\nOtherwise, aiko was quite a great character.\\n\r\nMy true problem with the anime characters lies with Yamato.. Handsome and loves Mei.. What else is there to say about him?? Not much I guess.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10\\n\r\nThis show was really enjoyable :D I would recommend to any person who likes slice of life/romance animes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10\\n\r\nI stated the reasons above :D.\\n\r\nBut I think I would have given it a 8 without that last eisode.\\n",

But it made me feel more uncomfortable than any other anime that has things like murdering and even people going insane, and this is just a high school romance. It felt like the relationship was forced onto the MC girl, by a guy who used to be an a**hole who dates and sleeps with every girl in the school. I stopped because the most part is it just made me uncomfortable seeing them havea really bad relationship that felt forced onto the girl and one sided, and literally everyone in the school cheats on their girlfriends/boyfriends and does terrible things. I will always love Asami though, but I couldn't finish this. Maybe I'm over sensitive about this, but it felt like watching a puppy keep getting kicked every episode.",

            "content": "I haven't reviewed anything for a long time so I'll try reviewing Sukitte Ii Na Yo. Please note I have NOT read the manga, so I will not be making comparisons between them; instead I will pit this series between past shows to see how it fairs, as well as my thoughts on the elements that make up the show. But first, the summary which I will make as vague as possible as to not give any spoilers; (I might give some in the actual critique).  The story is typical to shoujo high school romance archetypes in which an unpopular girl becomes of interestto the most popular guy in the school; soon challenges arise in every step, from misunderstandings to mind games and even physical altercations. Vague enough? Good, I\u2019ll go into some more details in the next paragraphs. It\u2019s not looking too good\u2026\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6\\n\r\nThe story mimics many of the past shoujo romances in the past such as Kaichou wa maid-sama, and Kimi ni Todoke just to name notable shows.  The frustration I get from this series is that it\u2019s as if the author did this in such a blatant way that I felt the plot was written with strict guidelines that one must NEVER cross; as a result, there is nothing that particularly stands out and separate this series from any other series in the past. I think even the director(s) of the anime had their own guidelines about story progression that I can pretty much predict what kind of \u201cdilemma\u201d would happen at what episode; from Mei\u2019s and Yamato\u2019s \u201cbreakup\u201d to the introduction of Yamato\u2019s past, to  the designation an antagonist.  They must have had a lot of vanilla to come up with a timeline like this. \\n\r\nAnother complain of mine is the episodic nature of the series. What I mean about this is that as far as conflicts go, it feels like in they disappear as fast as they come. Let me lecture a bit about high school English: there are 5 parts to a story, the exposition \u2013 the beginning of a story, and description, rising action \u2013 conflicts, complications and the like, climax \u2013 the collision of everything good and bad, falling action \u2013 the wrap up, and resolution \u2013 the closure; with those elements in mind, in the episodes throughout the whole series, these elements were recycled. To clarify my statement, you could visualize an ECG (a device to graphically measure a heartbeat), but that heartbeat is resting, and you see absolutely no difference in between beats, not like if you were measured from rest to run, where things get bigger, and more erratic and intense.   To put together all that jargon I just said, the episodes just do not seem to contribute to what SHOULD be the climax that is the last 3 episodes of the whole series. But instead, the conflicts themselves just feel isolated and the climax per episodes doesn\u2019t really overlap, or outdo each other. This kind of plot progression doesn\u2019t really suit the kind of tone this series, as well as the nature of its characters.\\n\r\nThe one thing that I noticed immediately about this show is its serious tone. I can\u2019t really bash nor praise this element because I would probably become bias; I like my over-the top and somewhat childish scenes, and overall nature of a show.  Throughout the 12 episodes, this show did nothing to give anything outside of the main plot line to make me smile, and was more focused on getting out the progression with no quirks in mind. Quite simply, the series was \u201cmeh\u201d about anything else, and was too busy with its own ***t.  I didn\u2019t feel offended by it, but at the same time, there was nothing in the series to disengage the audience even just a little bit  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:  7\\n\r\nThe one thing that I give praise about this anime is its maturity. With that said, I\u2019m talking about some of the character\u2019s backgrounds. Within the first five(?) episodes, I got to know Yamato\u2019s past, and how he had done the deed way before ever knowing Mei. This goes along with Yamato\u2019s friends; it\u2019s just like the high schools of the current generation.  But with that said, Yamato himself is new to actual romance, yet he knows how to sweet-talk to a lady, quite evident on how he talks to Mei, especially in private. \\n\r\nMei, well there\u2019s really nothing particularly unique about her; she is shy, almost never ever shows her feelings, quiet, borderline anti-social, homely, and downright boring at times. Of course throughout the series, I can see her develop in both personal and social wellbeing, while giving a few lessons back to Yamato, including how to take care of cats (lol). However, there\u2019s really nothing about her that stands out from any other main character of the same genres. \\n\r\nAs for the side characters, we have a somewhat preppy big-boob girl with a history of being bullied, and former bulimic/anorexic bitch turned friendly, a perverted guy friend (of Yamato), and a \u201cformer\u201d friend turned rival, and finally a designated antagonist who\u2019s as or more popular than Yamato vying for his love and turns into a complete bitch against Mei.  It\u2019s a mishmash of generic archetypes. \\n\\n\r\nSound:  7\\n\r\nI like acoustic music, so naturally I would like this one; although I\u2019ve heard others that I in my opinion are better. I do have to give credit where credit is due: Ritsuko Okazaki was also the composer and/or performer for classic anime such as Love Hina, and Fruits Basket, while Suneohair  perfomed the songs for Honey and Clover \u2013 one of my favorite anime ever.   \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\\n\r\nAgain, TYPICAL. I mean I don\u2019t know how else to describe it, the characters have gigantic eyes, the guys are tall, yet gentle to the eyes. The women are mostly petite, and slender. There is obvious attention to the characters, while the background blends itself in around them. The color is neutral, going with the serious theme of the plot, and the emotions of the characters. I\u2019m honestly running out of words.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\r\nI love cheesy. I love clich\u00e9; and I have to admit this anime has all of that. It\u2019s just the execution that really brought it down. The rollercoaster of emotions was just not there. There\u2019s just a little bit of excitement or happiness -  that one silver glint \u2013 and a conflict arises, and honestly gets boring after a while.  I don\u2019t know if that is deliberate or not, but it\u2019s as if the directors want the cats in the anime to be the only true source of happiness, because I must admit, they made me smile more than the characters did. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\r\nShuffle! is considered to be the generic harem.  To me, Sukitte Ii Na Yo is the generic high school romance.  It did good to focus on what happens in a relationship; all the hardship, misunderstandings, competition between lovers and friends, just plain old bitchiness sometimes, and the awkwardness of love itself. With all these elements, It would have been a sure hit. But sadly, the execution just could not be par to the expectations of years and years\u2019 worth of the same material. The potential is there, just not dice. \\n\r\nI do think this would be a good start to someone new to the genre, while still having a somewhat mature theme with it, but that\u2019s really all the credit I can give it for. \\n",

            "content": "Have you ever watched an anime which is well made and has a lot going for it yet it feels like it lacks something big? Well Sukitte Ii na yo is one such anime.\r\nThe story follows the romance of shy and friendless Tachibana Mei and popular and outgoing Kurosawa Yamato and how Mei learns how to trust people and Yamato learns how to be more considerate.\r\nThe story itself moves a great a good pace and does just enough to keep you interested and the artwork is very good as is the music so why doesn't do anything for me?\r\nThe main reason is that it lacksany kind of humour. There are virtually no laughs. Most of the characters are dripping with teenage angst ,your teenage years can suck big time but for most people there are at least some good memories. This is made worse by that, with the exception of Mei, they are all completely uninteresting. I just didn't care about them at all.\\n\\n\r\nSadly this could be a case of something that works really well in manga but not as well in anime. If you want to see an unpopular girl and popular boy romance anime my advice would be to watch Kimi ni Todoke instead.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I started \"Sukitte Ii Na Yo\" a bit impressed with how the plot genuinely interested me and how The emotions of the characters got through to the viewer so well. Though, while I wish this was the case for the remainder of the series, it wasn't. \r\nAs far as story goes, it's very similar to Anime like \"Kaichou aw Maid Sama\" and \"Kimi ni Todoke\" in that the main female lead is a bit closed off due to past experiences and the love interest slowly opens them up with their persistence towards the girl. While I loved Maid-Sama and Kimi nii , there where afew things that kept me from feeling the same about this series.\\n\\n\r\nWhile this series pretty short, the pacing and build-up towards the character's feelings feels a bit rushed and sloppy. I began watching this series really liking the first episode, though by the second one I felt a little disappointed with where it was heading. It really felt like they could have done a lot more with the plot. Despite that, I wanted to watch every episode to see if the ending would be satisfying and worth watching the whole series. I still had my hopes up, and really wanted to like this Anime as it seemed faily popular. The ending still left me feeling disappointed, unfortunately. There was really no sense of rising action or mystery to what would happen. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAnother aspect of the story that bothered me a bit was the message regarding the main character's relationship. That may sound a little vague, but what I mean is that a lot of times it felt a bit sexualized in that a lot of the characters feel that a relationship means nothing unless you do something physically. I do see that the Anime wanted to get across that the characters love can break walls, and that there are genuine people in the world, but that message felt a bit watered down when a lot of the cast is emphasizing that they are closer to the main male character because they slept together. This kind of thing becomes an issue with the main characters so often, that it can confuse what the creators where really trying to get across. The great thing about Maid Sama and Kimi ni Todoke is that they took on the idea of just loving and admiring someone, and only needed that as the plot went on to express comflicts and the general progression of the series (Sorry, if that doesn't entirely make sense ^^;) \\n\\n\r\nI have mentioned characters a bit already, but have yet to review that aspect as a whole. As far as the set of characters in \"Sukitte Ii Na Yo\", I actually really liked the main two characters. The female lead was very expressive and unique as not a lot of Shoujo Series' got that far with a quiet, introverted character. Her expressions and thoughts alone really portrayed her conflicts with trust and loneliness well, and I'm sure many people can relate to situations this character is seen in. With that said, it does feel like her build up as a guarded individual is kind of for nothing, as the plot dives into her talking to people after being alone and resentful for years. \\n\\n\r\nAs far as art and music, I did think the opening was alright, and the song was a good match for this type of plot, but it wasnt anything memorable as I can even recall the melody of the OP or ED song after 13 episodes straight. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation, however, was very impressive! The art style was very clean and unique, and the movements where often very fluid and natural looking in combination with the art style. I came into this series being imediately pleased with its visuals, and really enjoyed that aspect alone. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I really do feel \"Sukitte Ii Na Yo\" started off with a lot of potential. Gradually, though, flaws became apparent and I was left feeling that this Series should have taken an entirely different route. I do see how this series could have been really good. It wasnt bad, but it definately was not among the better Shoujo Anime I've seen, and I'm generally a big fan of Shoujo as it's one of my favorite genres. While visuals are very good, that definately doesn't make up for the plot. \\n\\n\r\nI really wanted to love \"Sukitte Ii Na Yo\" but I ended up not being able to. Though, while I thought the plot was way too quick, and it's perception of romance itself was a bit unclear sometimes, you may end up enjoying this Anime if you like a faster pace, and a protagonist who is a bit more angsty than most.",

Yamato was a bit too assertive, & kinda creepy at times, but compared to Kenji, who i fucking despise, he was was an angel. i mean, i get that Asami has a low self esteem but fuck, i can't comprehend why on Earth she'd go for someone like Kenji, who, yeah, may have a way with words at times, but is still a fucking sexist creep. after the first few episodes though, he's not really of any importance to the series, which is good. i wish Aiko, & Kenji would've been together instead, because i couldn't stand her either, although she's also not as bad after the first few episodes she appears in. i have a grudge problem, i guess. i just felt really sorry for her boyfriend. i didn't care about Megumi like at all. like, when it would start to go into some of her back story, i just didn't care. i couldn't care less about where she come from or where she was going, because she just wasn't all that important to me as a character. maybe at first, but not in the long run. same with Kai. when Yamato was just talking about him, & he hadn't appeared in the series yet, it was cool, & when he first appeared, it was cool, but not long afterwords, he just seemed pretentious, & unnecessary throughout the series. \\n\r\ni really liked Mei though, she was my favorite. she had a lot of good qualities, & as Yamato said, literally within the first few seconds of knowing she exists, she was interesting, & her mom was a likable character too, & so was Yamato's sister. \\n\\n\r\noverall- 7/10\\n\r\ndespite what i didn't like about this series, it was good. it was pretty cool. i may come back to it sometime.",

The character development was so incredible that I could actually see Mei turning from the quiet girl that nobody really cared about into someone who was loved and wanted by others.

I tried describing the side characters after the first few episodes and had to sum it up as they feel like real people. It's not a matter of do you like a character or not [though I ended up with strong feelings in both directions about them all] but just how real they feel.\r\nThe romances - that's right romances not romance - are fantastic. The main one betwen Yamato and Mei is of course the most complex but it follows the route of afirst romance between two people who might not be adjusted enough for it beautifully. The side romances feel like more than just a foil or plot device too. They have their own arcs that could probably fill an anime by themselves but take a back-seat to Yamato and Mei in this one. \\n\\n\r\nI found the intro/outro quite slow but the sound throughout the epsiodes was lovely. It fit the situation and was noticeable without being intrusive.\\n\\n\r\nAs a bit of an extra, the anime I'd watched before this had left me very upset about the treatment of cats. Mei gets me. Mei and Yamato and cats were just everything in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nI might have nostalgia goggles on but this still didn't quite meet My Little Monster & Black Prince and the Wolf Girl, for me.

And what I got... Let's say 7 is an extra rating for it.\r\nSpoilers ahead. It's necessary.\r\nStory (4/10)\r\nIt started very nice, actually. I liked that we had a cold girl as the heroine in the story. Yes, we had, because after a confession, that girl simply disappears from the screen giving the space to an extremely insecure and mediocre chick that turned the all nice vibes into a huge annoyment. The story has abase, yes it does, but this anime doesn't show a single development at all. A friend told me this changes in the manga, but it's quite disappointing when you can't see literally anything happening in an anime. It's really good when they show the character's past and help us to understand how it turned out that way and I feel like if they've done this with the *main characters* of Sukitte Ii Na Yo, the story would be much more appaling. Because of this lack of exciting content, it presents a calm atmosphere and I have a thing for calming animes so this is what saved the story for me.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing that really caught my attention. It has some nice and polished graphics considering it's not a very new anime. Beautiful scenario, very soft animation, very calming scenes.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nNice dubbing. The ending song is really nice. I didn't pay a lot of attention in the soundtrack, so I guess it's not so noteworthy, but I got no complains.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (6/10)\\n\\n\r\nI like Yamato a lot. I don't like Mei at all. As said, her first impression was really nice, but when her boring self appeared, I really lost all of my interest in her. She's so, so annoying. \"Why are you like this?!\", I asked to the computer  screen so many times. But tbh, I think that Mei's like this because she acquired social anxiety due to the rejection she's been through. Seriously, this behaviour of hers is not normal at all. If that's the case, then I totally understand it, but this is really not the type of protagonist I look for. For the other characters, meh. Nothing really special about them to be mentioned.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (5/10)\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I forced myself so hard to continue this show. The desire of dropping it came to me around episode 6, so, yeah, I spent 7 episodes waiting for something and then sighing of disappointment. For real? This anime were good only to help me sleep. That's it, guys. I'm sorry. I really wish I had guts to read the manga and see if something actually happens, but I can't. At all.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nWell then, after knowing my opinion, now you understand why I say my rating is actually more than it should be. But, well, it's the average. If I recommend this? Only if you need to sleep early; one episode will help you to calm down. But if you're looking for *something*... please try something else.",

The connection between the characters, their feelings being portrayed, for both the loving feelings and sometimes the bad ones. Are they compatible as friends as well as lovers? It's nice when they go to the next level and make it a deep story, showing how they get to where they are and let you enjoy the journey along the way.\r\nSukitte li na yo, or Say \"I love you\", has those qualities.\\n\r\nMei realises she's better off on her own, friends just hurt her and it always ends the same. The person she is at home and at school are completely different. At home she can be herself, nobodies around so she doesn't have to have her defenses up. When she's at school, she's constantly prepared to protect herself from people, trying her hardest to avoid them and just get through her day.\\n\\n\r\nYamato seems to take an immediate liking to her, she's not like everybody else. The way he goes after her, trying hard to become her friend is adorable. It gives it such a good beginning and made me very excited to see how the story between them goes.\\n\r\nHe's the usual handsome guy character, his thoughts and actions are adorable, lots of girls are interested in him but now, he's just interested in one, Mei. He slowly opens up to her, as she does to him and they realise they're very similar.\\n\\n\r\nAfter a sudden kiss when Yamato comes to her aid, things get a little weird. But the circumstances also force them to start realising their true feelings. Loving someone makes you vulnerable to even the smallest things effecting your feelings. It's really good at showing the good and bad that goes with starting a new relationship. It feels a little awkward at times, but it's supposed to. \\n\\n\r\nThere's a couple of places where it feels rough, kind of rushed and forced. It gets past it and it goes back to normal. \\n\r\nIt was good, I really enjoyed it, although at some points it just felt like something was missing compared to other romance shoujo I've watched that just had some little thing that is full of charm. It could be my fault for trying to search for what was missing, or maybe I missed it. It does have it's own feel, both with character art style and the story. \\n\r\nI was a little let down with the ending, but if you're after romance, this is definitely worth watching.",

Aloof girl meets handsome guy and they fall in love. Some people try to come between them, true love prevails. Typical shoujo stuff. \r\nThe art is okay. It's nothing to really recommend to people on the merits of good art. It's typical shoujo romance fair.\r\nThe character is what really gets to me. Mei is, to me, completely unlikable. I hate to, and rarely use this word, describe her as pathetic but that's what she comes off as. She'sshy to the point of annoyance. In real life, shy people are okay. As a protagonist of a romance, although a little or even a lot of shyness is acceptable, shyness to her point is just hindering the story.\\n\r\nYamato as a character is okay. Pretty unrealistic but this is a shojo story. I found myself disliking him as well. The other students were okay, but I couldn't name them even if I wanted to. They're more typical romance tropes.\\n\r\nEnjoyment is subjective. If I were more of a fan of stories like this, I would rate this higher obviously. The story is more shoujo crap and completely typical. This anime gets very boring, very quickly, and the characters inaction only support this.\\n\r\nOverall, I'd give it a 4/10. It's okay. It's just not the best. Or even good.",

It's return to normalcy.\r\nIt isn't much to say that there is plenty of action and drama in anime these days.  By that respect, it is the excess ofsuch traits that make seemingly plain series like this, well, stand out.  The one true plot twist here is the lack thereof.\\n\\n\r\nTake Mei for example.  There is absolutely nothing exciting about her.  She doesn't do sports, she isn't in a club.  She's just an outcast.  Even her [outward] personality isn't something to note.  But that's the point.

            "content": "My main problem with this anime is how damn frustrating the female lead is. Mei, who, while shown to be quiet and reserved from the beginning, also has moments where she can be fantastically brave and kick-ass (the round-house kick, sticking up for Asami, sticking up for Aiko and helping Nagi with her problems). I dislike her development throughout the series as it is not smoothly done. Initially it is understandable to be nervous about starting new relationships with people as she has avoided forming connections almost completely throughout her life but later in the series when she is frustrated with her situation with Yamato,or confused about when he is upset over something, instead of simply asking \"have I upset you/what is the matter\" and resolving the issue she is constantly having long-winded, sighful inner-monologues and basically has to wait until someone tells Yamato how she is feeling because she is entirely incapable of doing it herself. By the end her consistency is the problem with her character going too regularly from being glad to have finally made friends to being mopey and passive about whatever her new problem is.  Aiko says it best when she tells her to stop pussy-footing around. The voice actor, at least in the english dubbed version, was far too forlorn.\\n\\n\r\nMy critique of Yamato's short comings are less harsh because, while he should be more understanding of the way his behaviour makes Mei feel, and that he should show more trust, he does have to deal with trying to decipher every single thing that Mei thinks as she is basically a mute. Goddamn I would just have enjoyed the show more if she weren't so meek. (sorry)\\n\\n\r\nOtherwise, I don't mind this anime. While it comes off as a bit preachy at times with the whole \"we should all take care of each other/everybody has problems\" shtick that pops up in almost every episode, where at the beginning someone is being a really nasty person and it turns out that is because they have their own inner-demon,  then everyone is friendly by the conclusion.. at least the message is a good one. I also like the way the story doesn't stick to the usual formula of taking almost the entire season (if not several) for the two main characters to get together, instead with their relationship starting almost immediately (however, I would like that aspect more if, like I said, their relationship wasn't so frustrating).\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting characters range from mildly entertaining (although, they all have faults), to just plain awful. Aiko is probably my favourite of the supporting cast, as she shines in the moments where her blunt way of speaking helps to resolve problems. Seriously, her calling-out other people's BS is great. Unfortunately, she is also one of the characters that has a friendship with Mei that does not really make sense. She was absolutely atrocious to Mei in their interactions at the beginning of the series. Even with the back story supplied, I can't really buy their best-friendship (even though I am glad it eventuates).  Nagi is another of the characters who I like. However this is mainly because her interactions with Mei are some of the few times in the series where I like her. They have a good connection as they both had difficulty with making connections with people they could trust and rely on. I thought it was very sweet. Although, again, Nagi has a very bratty personality at times which is irritating, though, refreshingly accurate.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is quite pretty in this anime and all the characters are well drawn. Likewise the music does a lovely job of carrying the mood of the scene to the audience.",

            "content": "Sukitte Ii na yo really stood out to me, compared to other typical romance anime, it was just different and fresh, and a very welcomed thing to watch\r\nStory 10\r\nI particularly love how we see this poor, tortured [socially] girl whos been alone, and bullied, and has given up on having friends, or any kind of social life [consequently, the first few episodes were painful to watch, but it only adds to the value of the anime], but we get to see over the span of the episodes how things begin to look up for her.\r\nAlso, more often than not, when watching a romance anime, Ialmost automatically expect its a tsundere type story, but this time, we see a welcome change as this one is more of a Kuudere [bonus points!]...\\n\\n\r\nArt 10\\n\r\nits not mind blowingly fantastic, but certainly nothing to complain about... and to me, art and sound scores dont affect final score, unless they render an anime unwatchable... and that hasnt happened yet\\n\\n\r\nSound 10\\n\r\nFirst off, the OP song... \"Friendship ~\u300cfor Sukitte Ii na yo\u300d\" by Okazaki Ritsuko... absolutely fantastic, especially for this anime... normally we see up beat, happy songs to start an anime off, this one was slow and sweet and the lyrics were pretty simple but deep... I guess the best way to describe it is a harmonious oxymoronic piece of melodic poetry... [I chose those words very carefully, so take a moment to digest them :)]\\n\\n\r\n~Also, unfortunately, Okazaki Ritsuko passed away quite young due to an unfortunate case of stomach cancer, and I would like to take this opportunity to pass along my condolences~\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the OST is very pleasant to listen to, and is very fluid to the mood of whatever is happening... but one exception, the ED song, I found it a little off, and sometimes disrupting to the mood, but most of the time I skipped it anyway\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10\\n\r\nIn my opinion, the characters are a little extrapolated from typical roles, but still resemble a typical romance. Already mentioned, the Kuudere thing was nice, as was the lead guy who wasnt always perfect, and he caused some drama, and even made some audacious moves, but ultimately he treated her well, and did his best to make things better after he messed up... There were some characters that didnt really matter, but youd be hard pressed to get mad over that, after all, high school is full of things that dont matter, and no matter what story youre viewing, theres always an entire active world surrounding it\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment... its a 9... but its a 10 too\\n\r\nSometimes its not the feelings the story causes that matter, but the intensity of the feelings, and I think thats one area anime in general shines its brightest. here we see feels at the beginning... I almost thought this anime was going to be in the [Ano Hana/Clannad] category of sadness, but it did a 180 and had a very heartwarming finish. I would love more of this story to be manifested into a sequel season, but I have doubts about its fruition [just a feeling], however we do have a live action film to look forward to later this year\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9\\n\r\nA masterpiece for its class... I give it 100%, only thing is there are anime that go beyond [waaay beyond] expectation, and while Sukitte Ii na yo is totally fantastic, its just not mind blowing\\n\\n\r\nRecommended for fans of Romance, School life, Shoujo, and lower mid range drama",

There is just something about this anime I love. The character development is pretty great, the art is average I'd say, and the music is pretty good. But, I think why I really like this anime so much is because of the romance. Mei's development romantically is something you typically don't see in most shoujo anime. At first, she confines herself from others, claiming they only betray you when it becomesconvenient for them. But when Yamato, the most popular boy in school begins his pursuit of Mei, she slowly opens up and begins to make friends. But the strange part is that her personality stays relatively the same. I think this anime was well put together overall. If you're into romance/comedy anime, you must watch this!",

            "content": "One kick leading into a relationship\r\nMei Tachibana voiced by Ai Kayano is a very shy, anti social stoic girl, having the belief that having friend will lead them to betraying to later on, it' not until her chance encounter...well more like kick to Yamato Kurosawa voiced by Takahiro Sakurai where she one, develops a growing relationship with Yamato and two, open herself up to not only Yamato but everyone else as well.\r\nFor this kind of premise, it's in similarities to Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun, Kaichou wa Maid-sama and even Toradora with the dynamic of Yamato and Mei in a ways and was LA's early thoughts onthe primary relationship in question, where the main protagonist changes her.his ways when coming across his/her counterpart both in personality and changes the both of them for the better. \\n\\n\r\nFor many, if not ALL romance animes, there are trials and tribulations in which the relationship goes through much like Yamato and Mei's comes across, many of which seems in favour of Mei more than Yamato and LA isn't saying this in a good way. Mei goes through ALOT in this anime, sure the character and belief change about having friend sis one of the main goals for this anime by having Mei and Yamato in being together but man, does Mei goes through LOTS of rivals in order to do so, let's see we have, Aiko Mutou voiced by Yumi Uchiyama, a sorta ex of Yamato, Yamato's own sister Nagisa voiced by Mariyse Ise and the biggest obstacle Megumi Kitagawa voiced by Minako Kotobuki, while Yamato only needs to deal with Kakeru Hayakawa voiced by Yuki Kaji who rattles Yamato being the playboy but is only a focal point in one episode and his biggest obstacle, Kai Takemura voiced by Tomoaki Maeno who gains a crush to Mei after a heart to heart.\\n\\n\r\nNo point scoring or anything but many of Yamato and Mei's rivals defrost over time and become supports towards Yamato and Mei's relationship or moved on, as such Aiko, Megumi and Kai for instance being the best examples, so this is a good direction to place Mei and Yamato's rivals in, they aren't just rivals just to cause drama and then never be seen again. Megumi is actually an interesting case as her development contrast easily with Mei, as Mei gains new friends, Megumi starts to lose friends from Mei's circle and that causes her to lose it and goes almost into narcissistic territory but also regresses to pre-Mei before meeting Yamato and starts closing herself off from everyone thinking they will betray her. Yes Megumi did HORRIBLE things to mot only Mei but everyone around her when she lost it, but her development and contrast to Mei makes for a good rival, so at least the rivals were utilized quite well as abundantly in favour of Yamato it is.\\n\\n\r\nBut what about Yamato?, he \"may\" seem like the perfect boyfriend material but we learn more about him and he's not that perfect at all giving dimension Mei and their relationship. Yamato's always the caring one to anyone even before meeting Mei and that comes into play due to his backstory of him to able to save or help someone in his childhood, because he was a spectator, he now helps anyone so that he'll never see anyone sad anymore, so typical white knighting but this also comes into play towards the fact he's always willing to help someone, comes into their and Mei's relationship and how he really never been in a proper relationship so even he makes mistakes time to time be it neglect, misunderstandings or just communicating to Mei. In all, we have a main relationship where both of them are flawed in their own way and they learn form each other and that bond only got LA to be invested in both of them AND their relationship, Mei for opening up to people, while Yamato was about communicating properly to Mei. Barely anything progresses if the couple is \"perfect\".\\n\\n\r\nThe beta couples aren't that bad either and this includes some of the rival's and friends as well. So LA WILL say that in the character and drama department was actually done very decently and LA rooted for the main couple of the anime ALL THE WAY THROUGH so that's a good sign, not to mention that Mei and Yamato themselves also developed outside of the relationship as fleshed out character themselves.\\n\\n\r\nWith all that being said, Mei was quite obviously LA's favourite character, not only in reliability but LA rooted for her the most, not to mention all the crap she went through while still keeping her head up the majority of the time might also been a part of it.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation done by Zexcs was done decently in all regard, decent and character designs and the consistency towards the entirety of the anime was pretty solid. Sukitte Ii na yo. did rarely have some chibi moments but those were limited towards the comedic moments. Overall it was \"decent\" from Zexcs.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting, well LA actually has ALOT more to say in this department, from Ai Kayano doing a pretty decent stoic, shy and quasi-tsundere cadence as Mei and quit honesty for LA, the MVP of this anime, but also Yumi Uchiyama and Minako Kotobuki did quite well as Aiko and Megumi respectively, mainly in the dramatic department but also for their range much like Ai's. Others like Takahiro Sakurai and Tomoaki Maeno as Yamato and Kai did great in their roles as well and add Risa Taneda as Asami Oikawa. With a stellar and well known cast, LA kinda HAD to gush about this voice cast.\\n\\n\r\nIf there were any more flaws LA could pinpoint to Sukitte Ii na yo. well if LA did, then LA would also have defending points towards them but here goes, the melodrama at the start of the anime was a bit underhanded in all regards and all targeted towards Mei at that but like LA said about the many rivals Mei went through they actually became friends with Mei and supported their relationship latter on, they weren't \"just rivals\", next would be as much as Sukitte Ii na yo. employs the typical romance cliche, Sukitte Ii na yo. managed to make it use to it's advantage, yes some things are gonna be coincidental but to further Mei and Yamato's relationship?, well it works...to a certain degree. Lastly would be the open ended and lackluster finale, well spoilers but not really but their relationship was pretty solid even after all the rivals and trials and tribulations about themselves they went through, yes the ending gives a \"read the manga\" ending, but IF you root for this relationship, it's a no brainer that their relationship is solid and will continue as much as we can't see it in anime form for a proper conclusion but it's there.\\n\\n\r\nSukitte Ii na yo. was a very well done romance anime, sure the romance littered with rivals mostly targeting Mei in many aspects, but in this regards, Sukitte Ii na yo. still gives a very well done romance with a main flawed couple you want to root for, flawed main characters with backstory and fleshed out characters outside of their relationship, a rocky but overall decent supporting cast and sincerely, a decent melodrama that works in favour of the main couple or character's development. \\n\\n\r\nBecause, hey if you root of the main couple to be together, then your doing something right for a romance.",

            "content": "Story:\r\nThe title of the anime basically sums up its message. When you love someone, you have to be brave enough to tell them. The romance between Yamato and Mei is sweet and gentle, taking it's time to develop, and I think the relationship and the story are all the better for it. There are definitely some of the typical manga/anime cliche's here, conflicts for the sake of conflicts, etc., but they don't bring the story down. If anything, the way these cliche's and conflicts are handled make the story better. My only complaint? The last episode was very cute and enjoyable, but probably not thebest one to finish the series with. But that's really a minor complaint considering how enjoyable this series is overall.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nAt first, the characters seem rather stereotypical, but after spending some time with them, you find that they are anything but. They are incredibly real and 3 dimensional and full of life. They have real struggles, real fears, real weaknesses, and real strengths, and I thoroughly loved all of them.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art style is very simple and clean and understated, which I really like. When you have a story with the kind of slow, patient pacing as this one, you don't want to be flashy or over the top. The overall art style fits the overall message and pacing of the anime to a T.\\n\\n\r\nIn Conclusion::\\n\r\nI won't say this is one of my favorite anime's, but I thoroughly enjoyed watching it. From reading the comments on crunchyroll, I noticed a number of people seemed to be disappointed by the lack of a real conclusion to the series. While I do think the final episode wasn't the best one to end on (I loved it, but if it had been placed before the next to the last episode, I think it would have worked much better in the series), I don't mind the overall ending to the anime. The manga series is still ongoing, and an open ended ending to the anime means the possibility of continuing the story in further episodes. Which I certainly wouldn't complain about.",

Others will be useless from the start (sorry zigzagoon) Finally you will reach a point where you will have to cross a cave and motherfuc**** zubats will jump at you left, right and center. At that point, you will start stockingrepels coz you are just plain tired of fuc**** pokemon jumping at you and you just want to look around in peace. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime is like that. We have the shy, introverted girl and the most popular guy in school falling in love (wow so original, have never seen a premise like this before /s) But then each episode we have a new character jump in and cause some crappy complication or other. At first, you go, \"Huh! This character looks interesting.\" After a while tho, you just wish you had an equivalent of repel to stop all these characters from cropping up. And here is the kicker, all those characters went through the exact same trauma the MC did. So the MC is an angel who understands and helps everyone. \\n\\n\r\nAnd the main source of drama from episode 1 to the last one is essentially, \"Oh my god! Some random douche said something. Instead of talking this out, I will make a mountain of a molehill and cry\" This culminates in the final episode where the MC is thinking if she should visit her boyfriends house for23 mins. Yes, this episode is as boring as it sounds. \\n\\n\r\nI dropped Kimi no Todoke. But srsly, that did a better job than this. Save your time and watch that instead.",

Also, I think this is quite similar to Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun because it starts out at guy liking girl who has no friends, the girl 'having' some friends, then some other guy walks in and likes the girl and wants to win her over. I would say this anime is okay, not exactly my favorite, I feel there are a lot of awkward scenes, and, do not be offended!, but I findYamato very unattractive and kind of hard to look at.",

            "content": "Spoiler alert\r\nI have seen so many romantic animes. By far, the best one is Clannad Afterstory. Ever since then, I wanted to watch a love anime which had the same standards, if possible, higher. However, when I sat down to watch this show just because of its cover art, I thought it was fine. However, I finally realized just how bad it was. As a matter of fact, this is not worth a penny when compared to Clannad Afterstory. Now instead of putting my analysos together in one enormous bundle, I shall set it up in all of the anime's different components.\r\nStory: (1/10)\r\nThis anime#2 flaw was that it was not at all original. It didn't even have one aspect of uniqueness. The story itself had noting which I haven't seen or heard of. However, Sukitte Ii ya no's # 1 problem was that it didn't even have a story for 40% of the time. The only thing it had was when Yamato became a model, Megumi had run away, and Yamato's old friend came along during the beginning of the series. The entire story, however, was also just a cycle. It's Mei becomes upset, Yamato comes to help, Mei becomes upset, Yamato comes to the rescue, etc. It was so difficult to watch the show by episode 8, that I was about to drop it. I have seen a lot of anime, some before this series, and have only quit watching one. \\n\\n\r\nArt: (5/10)\\n\r\nThe art for the story was well simulated. The background also had the same result. However, the character design was  pretty much, similar to how the series is, unoriginal. Now, some characters actually looked unique, such as Kai and even Kurosawa. However, besides that, everyone looks regular. Nothing about the art was amazing.\\n\\n\r\nSound: (5/10) \\n\r\nThe music  scores were not well done. The opening was not at all emphasizing any of the story's aspects. It, by itself had no romantic mood or tone. Sure it was rather pleasant similar to the anime, however it would have gone better with some other anime, such as Shigatsu wa kimi no uso. The ending was actually somewhat better. However, it had, althoguh not as emphasized, the same atmosphere as the opening did. The soundtrack was somewhat better because it had actually brought out somewhat of a romantic mood. The sound for the anime however, was pretty good and unfortunately, was the best part of the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: (4/10)\\n\r\nThe characters were terrible. Yamato was actually the best character on the show, with a 2/10. The characters are a huge part of why this show is so conventional. The characters are huge stereotypes. Mei was the outcast who was also somewhat of a tsundere. Yamato was a talented person at everything he did however, have a somewhat interesting backstory. Aiko also had an unoriginal backstory and was at the beginning, somewhat of a tsundere. Her other friend, whose name I can't remember, was at most, a futile part of the show. The show also brought in characters who just created more repition for the show.The characters weren't even original. The best point for the characters was that, as many animes, especially romantic ones have pervertedness, this anime didn't have any characters of the sort. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (3/10)\\n\r\nI couldn't bear watching this show. It was just that terrible. I was counting down to when the last episode finally ended. I don't think that this show should have been released into the mainstream crowd.\\n\\n\r\nI gave an overall score of 3/10. II would recommend for anyone who's reading this to not give the show a chance.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I only decided to watch Sukitte Ii na Yo because I'm a sucker for romance, despite that, I really did enjoy the show as a show even if there were a few things that should be accounted. To me, it did a fair job delivering the show's point.\r\nSukitte Ii na Yo is like a combination of Kimi ni Todoke and True tears but more closely similar to Bokura Ga Ita. Though it had a few humor here and there, the anime feels more toward the serious feel. However, it had the typical boy-meets girl kind of plot, thus, the predictability. It had, on the contrary,enough moments to swoon the anime's target audience, being a shoujo anime, which are the younger females.\\n\\n\r\nWhat ruined it is exposition. It had the complete elements of a good story, the continuity of the scenarios flowed without ruining the story line and they introduce a character subtly before letting it enter into an important scene. But the inter-relationship of the characters--where the character believability is most centered--fell. There weren't enough scenarios to portray the development. Their friendship was there, and it showed to be a vital part of the story, and the struggle was there but I so craved--as an audience wanting more intimacy from the charas--for more portrayal of the deepness of all their closeness and elaboration to sustain the character development. The plot might've focused too much on the two protagonists that it left some other potential side stories that could boost the character believability, relatability and lovability only to mediocrity.\\n\\n\r\nRest assured, still, for that did not ruin the romance. As I've said, there were a lot of scenes that can make you swoon. And that it does not have any unnecessary details that can confuse, it stayed loyal to its path.\\n\\n\r\nI have nothing to comment about the art, it was well made for me. And the OP/ED did a good job into introducing and ending the story feel. The background music was also not interfering or irritating to overpower a scene, only to support, so I think it served its purpose.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for romance, like me when I did watch, give this a go but if you're looking for a story I'm not sure if this can satisfy you. Overall, I still enjoyed this and I don't feel regretful I took the time.",

I think the last official Shoujo title I checked out was Vampire Knight, for a couple of volumes till I got bored.\r\nAnyways.....\r\nArt = 7: I liked the art style of this anime, very soft and warm. Gives me that warm summer feeling, yes - that's a technical term. It's not a frantic anime so it was never pushed to the limit. The designs were ok for the most part.\r\nSound = 6: It didits job.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter = 7: For the most part, the stereotypes were filled in this title, maybe except the male protagonist - he didn't really have the \"im too hot and cool vibe\", just a normal cool guy, but that type of character is predominant in western media so nothing new for me. I guess I gave this a decent rating because of the chemistry between Mai and Yamato.\\n\\n\r\nStory = 6: Its pretty generic, nothing new to see here.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, even though this anime got ok marks technical wise, I still enjoyed it. Can't explain it other than it has that \"it\" factor. Personally, it reminds me of summer love, reminiscent to that movie \"A Walk To Remember\". \\n\\n\r\nSo if you're a romanticist (like I am), or just looking for a decent Shoujo anime then you might as well check it out as it might incite old feelings of romance in our old, narcissistic minds, lol.",

            "content": "In any art form, there is a reason formulas exist. Even when 'tried-and-true' passes into 'old clich\u00e9', we humans are drawn to the same things over and over again, because ultimately humanity itself hasn't changed. We all face the same basic problems and have the same basic desires. And so when we see these things portrayed in a story, we connect with it, no matter how unoriginal it may be. In fact, there's a sense in which a story can be made all the better by being as unoriginal as possible and instead simply dealing with the life experiences we all have in a waywe can all identify with.\\n\\n\r\nSuch is the brilliance of Sukitte ii na Yo. It's not the most exciting anime, the most thrilling, or the most clever. Rather it finds its charm in simply being genuinely human.\\n\\n\r\n*Story*\\n\\n\r\nMei Tachibana is a Grade A introvert, a social recluse who has withdrawn herself from any and all friendships on the sentiment that relationships will only end up with her getting hurt. But quickly file away any tsundere stereotypes that description may evoke\u2014Mei isn't afraid to speak her mind or portray her feelings, she simply struggles with finding anyone she trusts enough to do so.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the least likely of all people to become her first close friend is the most popular boy in high school, Yamato Kurosawa, yet that's exactly what happens when an incident with one of Yamato's friends ends up with Mei innocently and unintentionally stealing Yamato's heart. Unmoved by all of the skin-deep offerings of love from the other girls in school, Yamato is drawn to Mei above them all, first out of simple compassion and then out of love for her genuine depth of character.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a love story that wastes no time delaying romance for the big climax, but instead establishes very early on who the pair will be and then spends the rest of its time showing their development, and all the life situations, trust and broken trust that come with it. It's both a story of one young man's relentless pursuit of the girl he loves for reasons even she cannot comprehend, and how one person's affection can heal old wounds and restore lost joy in life for everyone around them. And no, it is not easy. It *is* complicated, it *is* messy...but it is also beautiful, not merely in spite of it all, but even because of it.\\n\\n\r\nIf that description doesn't make it clear enough, however, shounen fans should be warned: Sukitte ii na Yo falls pretty heavily in shoujo territory. While it may not be a terribly unique romance, a generic one it is not, clearly skewed to a female perspective. Not that that's a bad thing, but it is something to be aware of going in, as this in itself will limit Sukitte ii na Yo's audience, particularly among males.\\n\\n\r\n*Characters*\\n\\n\r\nSukitte ii na Yo is not interested in prolonging unnecessary social drama through misunderstanding and miscommunication and overreaction as is typical for slice of life and romance anime. While that's not to say none of the characters or situations they find themselves in are exaggerated in any way (they are), they all seem to share the same level of intelligence as the viewer rather than be cursed with substantially less. Slice of life anime buffs will encounter several familiar scenarios that usually end up painfully drawn out for no other cause than at least one character's utter stupidity or sudden indecisiveness, but instead Sukitte ii na Yo seems to be almost self-aware, using these moments as opportunities to really let its characters shine, often in unexpected ways. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, not everyone is instantly likeable. In fact, *at first* it is perhaps difficult to like much of anyone at all aside from Mei, who is undoubtedly the series' anchor. But this is part of the journey that Sukitte ii na Yo takes the viewer on: the same journey of Mei herself as she struggles to open up and learn to appreciate those around her\u2014or rebuke and reject them as bad influences, if need be. It isn't always immediately obvious what each character's true colors are, and there is a purpose for each personality represented\u2014even those painted in broad brush strokes to make a point. It could be said that a few characters develop too quickly, however this is simply an anime that covers a long period of time very fast, and overall the pacing is just right to allow the audience to develop with the characters without feeling distanced or left behind. And time is just what these characters need\u2014initially each is carefully designed to bring something out of Mei, to whom even Yamato takes a distant second on her personal journey back into society, but it isn't until the final third of the show that it becomes apparent just how deep and complex everyone else truly is and has been all along.\\n\\n\r\n*Animation*\\n\\n\r\nEach decade has brought with it its own style of animation, but Sukitte ii na Yo deviates a bit from them all, opting instead for a style that, much like its plot, is just one step short of actual realism. It isn't *completely* removed from popular animation, seen in how often it falls back on familiar touches to keep itself accessible and clearly recognizable as modern anime. But at the same time, it is realistic enough that the viewer can often get lost in its world and forget that it is 2D animation, and yet true to its genre it remains more beautiful than life, engaging the imagination from the very start and never letting go. Unfortunately it does also fall into the common trap of portraying Japanese high schoolers as 20-somethings of more or less ambiguous ethnicity, but while in theory this ought to detract from the realistic premise, in practice it ultimately makes the plot easier to identify with for a wider range of people. If you don't believe me, just look up a trailer of the live-action adaptation of this story and see if it maintains the same atmosphere in J-drama form. Sukitte ii na Yo both is and isn't a great departure from the norm\u2014all the familiar anime character types are here; they're simply more grown-up and life-like than average for anime. Even so, Sukitte ii na Yo is a nice blend of realism and fantasy, something refreshingly different despite not being entirely unique.\\n\\n\r\n*Soundtrack*\\n\\n\r\nSometimes the mark of a well-done soundtrack is that it goes completely unnoticed. It could be said that is true of Sukitte ii na Yo, what with its mostly subtle cues occupying the background and more often than not supporting the scene rather than defining it. What matters is that the soundtrack here really does perform that supporting role, augmenting the atmosphere just enough to generate the intended feelings, emotions, and atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nAnd on quite the other hand, the anime's opening theme song, an arrangement of the late Ritsuko Okazaki's 'Friendship', is one of the most perfect little diddies I've ever heard in this or any other medium\u2014one of those songs so soft and light and that flows so naturally you can't help but feel as if you've heard it a million times before. If you're at all susceptible to the genre it will immediately sweep you up in its bliss, and yet 'Friendship' isn't strictly-speaking a happy song. Instead the lyrics effortlessly capture both the beautiful and difficult aspects of life, not only driving home the overarching themes of the anime but giving all who identify with its message a life song to listen to over and over and over again. The soundtrack of Sukitte ii na Yo may be so-so as a whole, but like Mei in a crowd of mediocrity this one track is easily capable of making up for it, and singlehandedly sets the anime's tone very well with each successive episode.\\n\\n\r\n*Conclusion*\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Sukitte ii na Yo is an above-average anime that tells a mostly average tale. While as time progresses certain unusual events arise to shake things up from the norm, what makes it truly special is simply that it begins where most stories end with a 'happily ever after' and instead explores a much more human alternative. And while like many slice of life anime it suffers from being a bit contrived at times, for the most part it rises above what is expected and builds its characters with a surprising amount of depth and maturity. It may not quite be a classic, but its cult following is well earned by the likes of its deep characters, themes, and solid animation.\\n",

Nevertheless, there were certain aspects of the story that made me want to keep watching (I cannot state those aspects unfortunately because then I would be writing \"spoilers,\" sorry). However, the whole time I felt uncomfortable and on edge from the awkward moments. Still the story kept me watching. That is until I reached the last three or four episodes, I struggled to finish at the end due to the story plummeting into whoknows where. The ending left me unsatisfied. It literally just ended and left me saying, \"that's it!?\" I will admit that it is a decent watch because you can be drawn in by the the different character's and their issues going on, you want to know what happens in the end. But be warned, there were many, MANY awkward moments that made me want to crawl out of my skin because the couple made almost all of their romantic situations uncomfortable. I understand that is the premise of the story because she is new to love, but still awkward. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is decent, not great but a nice watch if you want some romantic gushy drama. The art is alright, music... eh but the different character's with their issues and personalities is what saved it for me and made this anime decent enough to watch.",

            "content": "Popular guy falls for unpopular girl. However unlike the norm, they waste no time establishing these two as a pair. It's refreshing in that the \"whole does he/she like me\" is over pretty much episode 2 which allows you to see the relationship grow. The bad thing about it is nothing ever really establishes why these two actually like each other and have a connection. Yamato's initial reasoning for being interested in Mei is that she roundhouse kicked him which makes her \"interesting.\" Mei on the other hand is so new to having friends or anyone show any real interest in her, would fall forthe first guy who genuinely gave her attention (something that is kind of made obvious when another character comes in). While they do have personalities that seem to get on well and work together, there is no real spark to them. The amount of obstacles they face would have broken up any normal couple with this little passion and substance.\\n\\n\r\nThe story's strength lies in the fact that despite characters with all sorts of traits with various levels of popularity, they have all struggled with their insecurities and their relationships (both romantic and platonic). Although there are some background characters, the majority have their own stories. Transitioning them into the main story is what throws everything off. It's never really stated why Mei's two best girlfriends all of a sudden became her BFFs out of almost no where (especially with the one who appeared latter). A person of Yamato's past who is transitioned in also was done poorly and his actions didn't even make sense with the story. Even Mei's nemesis who is interested in Yamato is poorly done and their first initial encounter is out of character for her Not to mention they do not explain her relationship to a friend you had no idea she even had when she was younger. Allowing connections and relationships to develop a bit more would have greatly strengthened this story. Transitions are super rushed.",

            "content": "So I thought of writing the story line of Sukitte Li na yo..\r\nWell the anime is about a girl named Mei who always feels lonely but cute and a nice girl. An honest girl who is caring, loyal, and willing to help others when the time calls for it. But time isn't always on her side especially during a day when she bumps heads to heads with the most popular student at school.\r\nHere's where the drama kicks in and his name is Yamato Kurosawa.\r\nYamato is one of the most popular guys at school and his name may even suggest a male version of Yamato Nadeshiko(no pun intended). He meets Mei in a very unusual way at school and later on so helps her with a problem involving a stalker. Yikes! Now, from there on and out, the two forms a bond.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the duo seems to very incompatible at first glance. And I honestly think the duo are quite compatible that balances out each other. We know that Mei is a plain and nice looking girl yet very honest with herself and with others. Yamato often goes out helping his classmates as well by putting others above himself. We can see that he dislikes people who just likes him for his appearance. When Yamato realizes that Mei likes him beyond just his physical appearance, the two becomes quite compatible. Although loathed by some of the other students at school, they are a good match. \\n\\n\r\nThe artwork of the series is quite realistic and portrays the backgrounds with the school life setting.\\n\\n\r\nSimilarly, the soundtrack of the series is lighthearted. Although not too well known, Yuuji Nomi engineers the series' music with his skills to create a sense of being there. It's nothing too special because it mostly is lighthearted and hardly noticeable at times. However, it is a sweet melody that depicts the settings and the characters especially the opening song. \"Friendship ~ for Sukitte Ii na yo\" by Ritsuko Okazaki is a very lighthearted song that gives off that melody of sweetness which depicts the duo's sweet relationship. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Sukitte Ii na yo is a pleasant series to watch. The relationship between Mei and Yamato is quite warming and realistic to what some of us may have experienced during our teen years. It's heartwarming, sweet, and at the same time has drama to it especially involving the other characters. It is also a shoujo that fits within its boundaries without going over heels or trying too hard. Ultimately, it's a rare little gem that deserves praise for its beauty. \\n\\n\r\nLike I mentioned before, the series is a classic for those into the shoujo medium. It is like a breath of fresh air to watch especially with the lighthearted backgrounds presented. For those into some school drama involving the typical high school life, it's like a journey all over again. \\n\\n\r\nIt is just like you're an individual who has a troubled past. You have been ostracized by various circumstances and nowadays, you don't give a damn what anyone thinks about you or your life. That is till you meet one of the Good and Nice looking student at school who takes an interest in you. Your heart pounds and for the first time in your life, you give a damn about your life and those around you especially regarding that student. That is where Sukitte Ii na yo shines. It's a discovery and it's a classic.\\n\\n\r\nIt looks like I've written a lot..\\n\r\nHehe..!!! yep it took a while but it is all I think about it. :)",

Both of the characters open up to eachother and the story is somewhat cute. I was hoping for something a little more action filled, but there's no real plot. Just the slow development of the romance.

            "content": "Romance/bishoujo fans, watch this if you're tired of the will-they-won't-they and unresolved sexual tension in most shows and animangas. Aside from that, I'm sad to say that the show leaves a small impression overall.\r\nBut (and there is a but) the way they showed how the romance unfolds between the two is memorable enough that even if I don't remember much about different aspects of the show, I still find myself recommending others to watch this title because of how realistic the show's portrayal of 2 high school students who are in a relationship. \r\nI'm only reviewing this from memory since I only rewatched certain episodeslately. For some reason, episode 8 really strikes me as the definitive episode of this show. It encapsulates what the whole series is about. I won't talk too much about it as I'd rather you go see it for yourself. Honestly, if you've liked that episode, I'm pretty sure you would have enjoyed the whole series. If not, then maybe it's time to give this show up. (Although 8 episodes in might be a bit too late?)\\n\\n\r\nStory-wise, while it did grant us the leads getting together, there were still some parts that you will still find frustrating. As you would come to expect from the Popular Guy with the Unpopular Girl trope, there would be lots of girls who would come in between them. Not to mention, the misunderstandings. There were still tons of hair-pulling times when you just end up shouting to the screen \"God just tell her/him!\" but I believe that's something you can encounter in real life couples as well. There was really nothing spectacular story-wise. The last episode even left me wondering 'Okay, this is how they're going to end this?' but that's really better left to a bigger discussion on Manga and Anime adaptations in general. Not to say the finale episode is completely underwhelming, however. You just have to watch it til the end.\\n\\n\r\nLooking back on it now, it's almost like they used the main relationship as a springboard to introduce new characters and bring to light their personalities and history. There were no new \"kinds\" of characters in Sukitte Ii na Yo. There were pretty much true to the type you'd find in most Slice of Life/Coming of Age and Bishoujo animangas, but what I do appreciate that the author and writers have done here is give them a different dimension. Gave them a sense of maturity, if I may dare say.\\n\\n\r\nArt-wise, I have no complaints there. This is typical bishoujo fare. Slender, thin stylish characters. Surprisingly enough the guys (Yamato and Kei, the one who appears near the end?) seem to be designed alternatively? More punk-rock alternative than just mainstream good-looking. I don't mind it at all. I paid no attention too much on the sound, except the seiyuus have done a commendable job on their voice acting. Some parts can get pretty heavy drama-wise and they have managed to convey the emotion needed for those scenes. So since I don't care much for the OP and ED, I'll just give it a fair score.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I find that as a romance coming of age series (I do consider it as that as we get to see the girl, at least, come into her own) Say I Love You or Sukitte Ii na Yo is pretty fulfilling and enjoyable. But on the whole, it still leaves a bit to be desired. It was good but not totally satisfying.",

            "content": "Why I hated it but it was good\r\nI watched a lot of animes without writing about my opinion in details (I am actually lazy), but it felt like I should state what in my view is the main point of this show and why it can be considered good.\r\nI didn't enjoy this for the most of time. Many times I was ready to drop it and mark it as bad. It makes you think just how messed up everybody is here a lot of times, with them behaving silly or bitchy (having random sex included, though I think of it as of a good partbecause it is unusual to see in shojou). I also hate the feeling you get watching how misunderstandings create problems out of nothing as well as people pulling dirty tricks on others, and here you will get it a lot. All the predictable cliche situations probably ruined the impression for many people, too. Though, somehow it manages to make you continue watching and wonder about the next episode.\\n\\n\r\nAfter your typical shojou start where a popular guy meets a strange girl and takes an interest in her with all the moments which make you like \"aww\" - despite we don't have to watch them being too shy to approach each other directly till the end - they begin dating almost right away and this makes you curious what will we get to see next.\\n\\n\r\nThe great thing is how it is not just focusing on depicting girls' dreams about a great guy afterwards but on relationship problems, including friendship. I could say a lot analyzing each of the characters but it all sums up as they had their story which made them act as they did, not meaning it justifies their actions but somehow makes you understand and even like them more gradually. You can see that in other animes, too, but all the mess here was exceptional. Someone even compared it to School Days - but this show is certainly more realistic without yanderes killing anybody. Even the least stupid character (and I actually think he's a great guy) was trapped in a wish to get a revenge on his bullies (though he realized it was pointless afterwards).\\n\\n\r\nAnd this is how life is, as well. I bet some people could see themselves here or at least relate to the characters at some points. Everyone goes through similar problems in their school years, though it doesn't always work out in real life as it did here. That's why afterwards it leaves you in deep thought. Was it good that everything worked out for them here - well, I think yes. It would be a disappointment and too much of drama otherwise, while this way it even gives a viewer some hope. \\n\\n\r\nThings could seem rushed sometimes but I guess it can be overlooked since we only have 13 episodes. Actually, I think this being hard to watch already would only get worse if it had more. I didn't read the manga, though.\\n\r\nThere are some good dramatic moments and the art was nice, though some of the girls who were supposed to be beautiful looked more like silly and plastic to me. No complaints about the sound and the OP song was quite touching.\\n\r\nAlso, the last filler episode was kinda bad while the 12th episode really concludes the story, but I can imagine someone finding it funny.\\n\\n\r\nThen, in general I wanted to say that despite a lot of flaws and being hard to watch this is still worth watching. My overall score is 6 which I don't consider bad, more like \"somehow enjoyable\". The one thing is certain - with a lot of people hating or loving this show it probably won't leave you indifferent as well, so at least give it a try.\\n\\n\r\nP.S.: This is my first review here and I am not a native English speaker, so sorry for my writing flaws if you find any.",

            "content": "TL;DR: Very, very cute and heartwarming shoujo romance, perhaps a bit clichee depending on your taste.\r\n_____________\r\nStory -\r\nThe main \"plot\" is simple.. girl who has no friends (and doesn't trust people) because of something which happened in the past gets to know the most popular guy in the school. They fall in love and become a couple. Of course there are other people getting involved during this too.\r\nWhat made this anime very enjoyable for me, compared to other romances, was:\r\n- They become a couple very early on, like on the second episode or so, and the show itself progresses at a rather fast pace (throughout thewhole show, there's a whole year passing I think). So there is a lot of focus on their development as a couple, instead of development to -become- one like so many other romances out there do.\\n\\n\r\n- There is no crappy drama based on stupid misunderstandings where you'd just think \"how can you be so dense?!\". Of course there are misunderstandings, and both of them are not that well when it comes to handling a relationship, but it always gets cleared up properly (and fast), which I find favorable compared to other shows who tend to throw a relationship back to square one for multiple episodes because of some stupidity.\\n\\n\r\n- There is no excessive rivalry built up, I find it annoying when basically the whole show focuses on the fact that there is a love rival. There is some rivalry, but it doesn't get dragged out exceededly.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are likeable, even those who start out to be hostile end up to be very nice additions. You learn backstories for most of the side characters as well, explaining their actions and behavior quite nicely. \\n\r\nOf course this anime makes it all look so simple; romance, friendship and everything just playing out nicely, but I don't see why that's necessarily a bad thing. Sometimes you just need a helplessly optimistic show. \\n\\n\r\nThe Art and Sound mix up nicely together, nothing to say here.",

Just want to know if this one is worth your time and if you should watch it? I got you covered.\r\nFor a shorter Romance anime, this one hits a lot of the right spots for me. While the main female character has some of the typical traits you'd expect (shy, outcast, never been in love) the male lead moves quickly. At first it is almost too fast, because it is not the normal. The dothings in the first few episodes that normally take an entire season. Then unwrapping all the emotions that come after that and the female lead's struggles become the main focus. \\n\\n\r\nBut it takes the anticipation of the MC's \"finally\" getting together and flips it around, having things progress quickly at first, but then slowing down and taking a look at some different topics and side stories. It was actually a breath of fresh air for me. \\n\\n\r\nNothing ground breaking at the end of the day, but a solid romance show that doesn't leave many loose ends and progresses well for a 13 episode show.\\n\\n\r\nHIGHLIGHTS: Breaking romance anime norms a bit, good art, music fit well, just enough info about side characters that they aren't one-dimensional, not many loose ends\\n\\n\r\nDISAPPOINTMENTS: Once the MC's are together not too much happens, lots side stories",

Mei (Sukitte) is antisocial by choice and her actions and feelings are far more in line with how anyone would react given her situation. Additionally, her relationship with Yamatofeels organic and not very \"only in a movie.\"\\n\\n\r\nThis by no means is to take anything away from FMTY, however after watching FMTY first and then Sukitte I can't help to think that the latter is FMTY but the characters and flow of situations are of this world and not an anime.\\n\\n\r\nWatch both, definitely worth the watch!",

The only reason I resumed watching it was because I had nothing better to do.\r\nAnd the show got better, thank god. The beginning was so dismal, with melodrama ensuing almost immediately. Moreover, I could not see for one second why Kurosawa would take a liking to the anti-social, perpetually sulking Mei. However, once Ioverlooked that problem, I found Mei's character growth kind of nice. \\n\\n\r\nThe later episodes, although a huge improvement from the previous ones, still sported a lot of weird situations. An example would be how -\\n\\n\r\n (**SPOILER)\\n\\n\r\n apropos of nothing, a famous model transfers to their school. And to match that, Kurosawa also becomes a model. Heavens. This is a bit much.\\n\\n\r\n(/END SPOILER**)\\n\\n\r\nBut I do like how Kurosawa and Mei gradually grew as characters, and how their relationship matured, slowly but surely.

I was immediately wrapped up in the story of a fairly relatable girl trying to open up and make the burgeoning relationships in her life work out. I initially really loved the chemistry between Mei and Yamato, Yamato's desire to become friends with Mei despite everything he's heard was heartwarming. As the show progressed it became... average as far as the story goes. The romance occasionally felt stilted, and the side characters stories impeded the main characters too many times for my liking. As the show goes on less interesting plot things happen andmore 'misunderstandings' crop up. \\n\r\nThe end of their romantic arc in the Festival episode was satisfying, as it tied up loose ends with their plot as well as the side characters. The episodes after that are pointless and meandering filler.\\n\\n\r\nI would say I recommend this anime for those who want a satisfying romantic story, but don't mind traditional shojo pitfalls throughout.",

From the girls and guys point of view it shows how your little actions can effect the other person without even realizing. I believe this anime a nice job about overcoming those kind of issues in a relationship. It also hits on a lot of self esteem problems that womenface. Dieting and not feeling good enough can send someone down a dark path when you feel like your alone. So I also think it does a good job at showing that it\u2019s okay to not care what other people think and that you don\u2019t always have to face it yourself if you let the right people in. I highly recommend this show if you are into Shojo anime. It was a cute romance anime without being too mushy for guys as well. It just does a nice job showing how it feels to be on both sides of the relationship when you\u2019re finding your way through new found love.",

            "content": "Sukitte Ii na yo has been on my on hold list for a few month now after I watched the first episode, the reasons that I could remember for this show to be on hold were just the art style and my misunderstanding towards Shoujo as a genre. When I watched the first episode of this anime, I just started watching romace anime, and for me, I had lots of shows on my list. The First episode didn't catch on to my childish taste in romace, so I left it there, and forgot about it.\r\nLast Night, while browsing YouTube aimlessly, I came a cross atop 10 YouTube video. With nothing but \"Trash Harem\" on my plate, I clicked on the video. Althoght this anime wasn't rated that high on the list, I found myself wanting to give it a second chance. So here I am (7 am), after a allnighter finishing this show episode after episode. \\n\\n\r\nFirst, lets talk abut the setting. There really isn't anything new here as far was the Shoujo and school romace genres go. An anti social girl and the hotest, most liked boy in the school, An idea that has been done countless amounts of times. But to me, a overused setting/background does not mean the anime is automaticlly going to turn out bad. The most importent parts to an anime is how they handle the character devalopment and the overall story line, in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nLets talk about Characters. The charaters here are fairly well done, beside one fact, it seems to me that everyone has the worst childhoods ever. Having tragic backgrounds gives the characters' actions more emotion and give the viewers more things to relate on. But this show does it to everyone who is some what of a main character. Overall, the characters seemed fairly realistic and likeable. Tachibana, Mei's Change was every well done\\n\\n\r\nThe art is something that put me off at first. It's always hard to have something other than the main steam anime art style, but after watching every little detail, I realised how beautiful some of the animations and still piantings looked. The charater's faces are done at perfect timings to give the show its comdy effects here and there. The art is different, but it sure is not bad. \\n\\n\r\nHere is where I talk about how this show was about to move me. As someone who watches 90% romace, a special kind of romace anime has always been at the top of my list: Those that can pull of a \"relationship starting early\" well, without the same events repeating themselves over and over again. Some of my all time fav such as \"Golden Time\" \"Soredemo Sekai wa Utsukushii\" and \"Bakemonogatari\" all did a great job of that. This show was not that far behind. Events felt some what relatable, and uselly ended on a good note, which is aways a good thing for rommace anime. There were moments that moved my heart, actions that I was exctied about, and words that will drive me carzy between happiness and sad. The Enjoyment was definelly high up there.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are looking for a masterpiece, you are most likely in the wrong place. But if you want a cute romace story that has a story to keepyou hooked, this  is the shoujo/Romace for you. \\n\\n\r\n(Oh yeah, why does this show make it seem like Highshcools in Japan are just full of kids being bullied, fake friends and having sex with any hot guy and girl you can find? Just me? idk, let me know what you think.)",

It's something we've all seen done elsewhere with quitecommon character types, good enough sound and music, and decent art. If you're looking for something to scratch that itch for a common romance story, this will definitely work once you've watched all the better ones.",

Very disappointed in how lack luster it was....it's not that it was awful or something terrible occurred necessarily, it just felt like a big build up to hear something the whole show then the end just kind of fizzled....with no fulfillment...I mean SAY IT ALREADY....lame.\r\nAnyway, having said that if you like drama romances, school shows, etc.... You'll probably really like this one, definitely worth watching and i really liked thecharacters too.  They will make you angry at times, but normal dumb stuff thoughtless kids too...nothing to make you hate them long term.  Definitely worth a watch.",

I didn't really take to the characters as first as I thought they were very cookie-cutter, but the more they developed, the more I loved them. By the end, I was sad that I would never see the rest of their lives together. \r\nThis anime also touches on the very important issue of loneliness. It had a very nice overall message for young people, which I always appreciate. \r\nOther than that, I was just gushing over this anime the whole time I was watching it.I blushed when they blushed, I panicked when they panicked, I laughed when they laughed. The characters seemed a strange combination of real and unreal, but that was fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nI've been watching a lot of heavy anime lately, so this was a nice break.

And to top it all of, the dialogue is atrocious, so when thecharacters make pointed declarations it just comes off as phony.\\n\\n\r\nThe relationship is bad, the characters are bad, the dialogue is bad, the show is bad.",

            "content": "I am really not sure what's going on with me, but recently I am into romance/slice-of-life anime. I found them always so boring but they become quite interesting because of all that drama that happens. Not to mention that they are usually 12 or 13-episode-long, which makes them perfect if you just want to relax. I saw a short video on instagram for this anime and I instantly wanted to watch it. And here is, a few days after I finished it, the review on Sukitte Ii na yo or Say \"I Love You\". \r\n  Plot and Story Line  \r\nSay \"I Love You\"follows our main character Mei Tachibana trough her high school life. After an incident in middle school, where all her so-called friends turned their backs on her she decided to stay away from people as far as possible. She never wanted to have friends again because she didn't want to go trough the same experience again. Her method seemed to work until a certain guy showed up and changed everything. That boy happens to be Yamato Kurosawa-the most popular guy at school.  He was probably the only one not to ignore the introverted Mei and what's more, he even freely gave her his phone number.\\n\r\nSukitte Ii na yo is a story about the slowly developing relationship between Mei and Yamato, along with some side stories that add up to the drama of a teenage life. It is all about relationships, friendship and good looks. It really portrays the daily school life of every teenager. Whether it is a girl, jealous of the other one because she is going with the guy the first one likes, or it is a boy that just wanted to fit in... Everything happens in Say \"I Love You\". \\n\\n\r\nFact is, in the middle of the story stands the relationship between Mei and Yamato and their steady disagreements about how hard it is to confess to someone and say I love you.  But Sukitte Ii na yo also tells stories about other characters from the show. My favorite side-story was about Kitagawa Megumi. She is an always-cheerful and happy model that only lives for looks and the way others see her. She goes trough a thug time and undergoes a great character development. Her story delivers the message \"Be your-self and don't let others control you\". And even tough she is a \"witch\" and manipulator, she is also very strong and brave. I was so glad that she actually became a better person in the end.  \\n\r\nOne thing is for sure about Say \"I Love You\"-drama, drama, drama. It is also hilarious, especially in the Mei-Yamato moments. The plot is really good. There are no plot holes, the story is smooth and the only bad thing about it...There is no second season. There is an OVA and one special but...that's not it.\\n\\n\r\n  Characters  \\n\\n\r\nAaaand again, an anime with awesome characters. Sukitte ii na yo is an anime with so many interesting, unique and amazing characters and personalities. There are also so many character developments, which is actually a part of the life of a teenager. Growing up and realizing who you really are. \\n\\n\r\nOf course the major character development happened to our protagonist Mei Tachibana. An introverted, creepy loner turned into a rather popular, cute and friendly girl. She became someone that gives advice to others even tough she has no idea about friendship and relationships. She is also a strong and funny character. \\n\\n\r\nI really thought that I'd hate him, but I didn't. I hate overly perfect characters, and even tough Yamato looks like one, he is not. He is popular, good-looking, supportive, nice etc, but also has his own flaws. He was afraid not to fit in and be lonely so he gave up on his best friend. Later on he realizes what he had done and truly regrets it.  \\n\\n\\n\r\n  Animation and Style  \\n\\n\r\nThe animation of this anime is great. No flaws at all. Yet, I personally liked the style the most. The characters really looked different and I loved them. The colors are bright, you can enjoy beautiful settings and if you don't like the story that much, you can at least enjoy the good animation.\\n\\n\r\n Conclusion  \\n\r\nTo conclude, Sukitte Ii na yo or Say \"I Love You\" is a romance, drama and slice-of-life anime you should watch after an extremely hard week. Watch it all at once. You won't get boring and in no time you'll be saying \"I Love This Anime\".",

Still, there are sweet moments here and there that make me smile and there's nothing off about the show. In fact, the show is pretty well done.

There may be clich\u00e9 moments at times as well, but that's what makes it beautiful. And I love the mix of the two characters, making them one of the best anime couples. I've never heard of many other romance animes, but this one seems to be the best (excluding Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun).It knows how to put romance and love in the anime correctly, and how to keep the watcher interested. If you're a big action person, I say this one anime is good for you.

The main gripe seems to be that the plot/charactersare too boring or basic. On the contrary, I would say that the character interaction and plot is actually quite complicated and intricate. Unlike most romance series, this show doesn't hit you over the head with its message and spoon feed you everything through narration or dialogue. The author relies on the experiences of the audience to inform their understanding of the plot. When you take that into consideration, the series' complexity is deeper than most.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound are competent, but not particularly special. I do like that it doesn't sexualize the female characters or shove fan service in your face at every turn (I will always mark up art design that doesn't do these two things). The series' art seems to go downhill as the episodes move on, which makes it seem like they started to run out of money or time and had to do the later episodes without quite as much polish to make up for it. I would give the beginning an 8 and the rest a 6, so I give it  a 7 overall for art. The music and voice acting is competent and you won't notice any of the common issues with bad anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the series is a very good. If you like romance plots, this is a must watch. If you're not invested in romance plots, but just want to see a good story this is still for you. If you're looking for fan service, action, or heavy drama, I would probably look elsewhere.\\n\\n\r\n\"Say 'I love you'\" gets a much deserved, 8/10.",

            "content": "Sukitte Ii na yo is a cute anime to watch when you need a quick shoujo fix. At 13 episodes in length, this anime tells the story or two unlikely people at the beginning of and during their relationship. \r\nMei Tachibana is a quiet girl who doesn't care for people very much. Yamato Kurosawa comes into her life and shows her that all people aren't the same, and he tries to gain her trust. Their first interactions are sweet, and it will probably make you swoon over the lengths that Yamato goes to show that he cares for Mei.\r\nThere are several times throughout the animewhere I found myself lost. I feel like certain plot lines were opened up and then quickly closed. This caused confusion and after wondering for awhile why something had happened I just had to let it go. \\n\\n\r\nThe growth of their relationship was rather slow, but I appreciated how Yamato was willing to be a gentleman towards Mei and not rush her into anything that she did not wish to do. Because of this I hope there will be a second season because right now their relationship is not to the point I expected it to be. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the plot is rather slow and somewhat confusing at times, I still found myself rushing back after classes to continue watching them grow. It was a short, sweet shoujo anime and I hope this isn't all we see of Yamato and Mei.",

However I didn't like the lead couple.\r\nThe male character is a little too \"alpha\": too self-confident, too perfect, too tall, and too possessive. One gets the unpleasant feeling, as the shows progresses that he *could* become an abusive boyfriend/husband. The female character falls for him too easily, and then she becomes way too submissive. Overall, too often it looked like he treated her like she was his pet, to put it bluntly.\r\nSo that's it. I simply didn't like the personalities of the main characters, but that doesn't mean they are bad. If you have a similar opinionafter a few episodes, I can only suggest to watch Kimi ni Todoke instead, which is quite similar but with different personalities.",

            "content": "This anime seems pretty average. The unpopular girl and the popular guy fall in love, the unpopular girl gets a lot of friends, yeah yeah, but honestly, it was amazing. \r\n*A few spoilers, sorry :3*\r\nThe story is centered around Tachibana Mei, and Kurosawa Yamato. Every girl wants a piece of Yamato, and he's too nice to straight out deny them. One day, Yamato's friend annoys Mei so much that she roundhouse kicks Yamato right in the face. From that moment, I knew this anime was going to be amazing. From that moment, Yamato finds something intriguing about Mei, and she learns to give him achance, and they go out. The story then is about their innocent and adorable relationship, as well as effective side stories about the other characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is your average shoujo art, so there isn't much to say. But it's still very good, and I really like Mei's casual but cute outfits throughout the story ^-^\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was great. The background music always fit in perfectly with whatever scene was going on. The opening was nice, took a little to get used to it. The ending song was absolutely amazing, I love it so much, and it's actually one of my favorite songs right now.\\n\\n\r\nThe character development was amazing. From the first few episodes, Mei seemed somewhat aggressive, especially with that roundhouse kick and all, but you can see that she is actually very shy and gets embarrassed really easily. Also, Yamato seems like that womanizer, who can get anyone he wants in seconds. Once Yamato and Mei start going out, you can see that he has his heart set on Mei. Mei and only Mei. He doesn't want anyone else, just Mei, which was absolutely adorable. The things Yamato does for her, and the things Mei tries to do for him are so adorable. Their relationship is also slow, and not rushed which makes me love this anime even more.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I enjoyed this anime thoroughly, and I thought it was great, and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys romance, school life, and shoujo overall\\n\\n",

I've seen this story flushed out before..., but I would have to say a highlight was episode two, where it was actually interesting and unexpected, hehe. Another episode that I enjoyed was the episode with Nagi-san and the encounter of the cats! You will have to watch for it. There are love triangles and the occasional mean girl -- there are always mean girls and gossip around the school genre. \r\nArt: The animation was above average, but nothing extraordinary. \r\nCharacters:The characters stickout, that I enjoyed the secondary characters more than the main characters! IMO, I liked Kai-kun, Nagi and Megu-tan after she gets over an obstacle ( I will not say what, you will have to see). \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I did enjoy the series overall. There are some cute episodes, some comedy and the romantic scenes are not obnoxious as opposed to harem genres...\\n\\n\r\nI'd say give it a try, if you want a more slow-paced, slice-of-life type of romance anime, but if you're looking for a better romance with plenty of comedy these series trump over Sukitte Ii nya yo: 1) Toradora! 2) Ouran Host Club 3) Kaichou wa Maid sama 4)Skip Beat \\n\\n\r\nAlso, \"My Little Monster,\" which is what I'm currently watching, has a similar premise, but the main guy and gal characters are more memorable.",

If you're into a solid romantic story line between two lovable characters with interesting pasts, then I'd definitely recommend it. 9/10.

Each one had their own battles to fight whether it be their own personal morals or societal pressures. \r\nIt was easy to connect with these characters. You don't have to think that hard when watching this series, but the show makes you FEEL what the characters are feeling, whether it be those first-love anxieties or the feeling of overwhelming lonliness.\r\nOverall, it was a real joy to have watchedthis show.

            "content": "Sukitte Ii na you or Say I Love You is a romance, slice of life anime that aired from October 6, 2012 to December 30, 2012. It has thirteen episodes + OVA and it's from the studio Zexcs based on the manga by Kanae Hazuki. Now I am currently reading the manga and decided to watch the anime and I've got to say, I personally like the manga better. Let's get into it.\r\nStory line: Say I Love You is about Mei Tachibana, a girl who decided she didn't need any friends because of how people treated her when she was young. Until she meets YamatoKurosawa whom she accidentally injures and he ends up falling in love with her and they start to date. Now this anime had a really good story-line but it wasn't really those twos relationship that caught my attention. It was how Mei and other victims of bullying took it. This anime revolves heavily around bullies and victims of it and that's what I loved about this anime. Every episode, even if it was only for one, it would talk about one of the characters past and how they got bullied, like Mei.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: I liked most of the characters like Mei. She was hilarious at times and other times she made me supper depressed but because of her making new friends, her true self, the funny and shy type started to surface. Another one of the best characters and my favorite at that was Aiko. Her past just really hit me and just her character in general. She stands up to anyone that pisses her off and that's what I loved about her. I did not like Yamato one bit. Sure he did help Mei out of her lonely bubble but he was just such a prick. He would keep thinking that Mei was cheating on him and he didn't stand up for Kai when he was being bullied. He was just such a crappy character, not a crappy written one but the character himself, his personality and everything was horrible. Now the last character I'm gonna talk about his Megu. I did not like her but when her past was revealed and it was a lot like Mei's was what got to me. She was a bitch to Mei and almost a lot of other people but she sorta made up for it but I still don't really like her. Though her hair is gorgeous, oh my god.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: It wasn't anything amazing, in my opinion but for the opening I think it really stood out. At the beginning where Mei holds out her hands was probably the best part of it all but I will say that not one single moment did the animation look terrible.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: The voice actress who voices Megu, Minako Kotobuki did an amazing job with the room scene between her and Momo. The way she portrayed the character in that scene and any other scene was amazing. I also give praise for Ai Kayano who played Mei, Risa Taneda who played Asami and of course, Yumi Uchiyama who voiced Aiko. The opening was beautiful, most likely because it was performed by the late Ritsuko Okazaki who I adore, even though she is gone, she is by far one of my favourite Japanese singers.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I enjoyed myself watching this anime, for I got really into it especially the last four episodes where I couldn't stop screaming at the laptop, hoping my anger will smash into Yamato and Megu somehow.\\n\\n\r\nI most definitely recommend this anime if you happen to like romance and shitty characters (Yamato) and characters that have a depressing past but still want to punched them out (Megu.)\\n\\n\r\nI give Say I Love you a 7/10 and a 3.2 out of 5 stars.",

            "content": "Sukitte Ii na yo is just a \"basic romance shoujo anime,\" as I like to phrase it, meaning that it's just about a couple and drama. No supernatural beings, no action, just... romance and drama. These types of anime aren't necessarily my favorite, but I was surprised and pleased with the warm, bubbly feeling Sukitte Ii na yo left me. \r\nMy thoughts on...\r\nPlot:\r\nI really enjoyed how they went about with the story plot. It wasn't too rushed, other than the beginning when Yamato kissed Mei to protect her from the stalker. It did a good job showing how romance works as well, with both loveand arguments, and how interactions could affect them. It wasn't just automatic love either, unlike some anime. The different scenarios the both of them got into made their relationship stronger and brought them closer together, eventually to the point that they weren't afraid to admit that they were dating and weren't afraid to express their love to each other. Overall, the plot was good and had good pacing. The romance wasn't rushed and seemed realistic. \\n\r\nOverall Score: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\n-Mei Tachibana\\n\r\nI could actually easily relate to her. Her personality resembles mine, kind of reserved and quiet. I also hold in strong emotions like she does and I don't really talk about what's going on that causes that emotion. The main thing I disliked about her was the fact that she easily believed rumors. I did feel kind of bad for her though, because it did seem as Yamato was being a total jerk at one point.\\n\\n\r\n-Yamato Kurosawa \\n\r\nI really enjoyed his personality and how he expressed his feelings for Mei. He seemed to genuinely care about her and wasn't one of your typical, emotionless shoujo guys. He was kind to almost every person, which is also something I liked about him. I didn't care for how he was a jerk at times, however, he always made it up. I absolutely loved it when he would run after Mei and try to find her to apologize. It always made me smile. \\n\\n\r\nThe side characters were okay. I didn't necessarily care for any of them or in a way that would make me want to mention my thoughts about them like I did to the two main characters. Something the anime could've worked on was giving them more airing time, because I never actually got attached to any of the side characters like I do in most anime. \\n\r\nOverall Score: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nArtwork/Character Design:\\n\r\nI actually enjoyed the artwork in this anime a lot. It was really nice and had the correct amount of detail. Enough that it showed good features, but not too much that it became overbearing. The only issue was the fact that occasionally the background was too colorful that it distracted me from the rest of anime.  My favorite character design was Yamato's. I really enjoyed the details of his hair and how his eyes have sharp details but look soft. I also did enjoy the eyes of this anime. They're so detailed, especially the eyes/eyelashes.\\n\r\nOverall Score: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\r\nA really cute anime that is very realistic with the aspects of life. The plot was typical for an anime of the romance genre, but it was original in its own way and made the anime different somehow. I would recommend it to anyone who likes shoujo or romance with a bit of drama.",

            "content": "When you ask someone to recommend a romance/school anime many people will recommend Sukitte Ii na yo, because supposedly it is very good...well, it is good, except for the fact that it is highly overrated.\r\nStory: The story is actually quite nice, although very clich\u00e9. After 2 episodes I thought it was fast-paced but the story development actually slows down after the beginning (a fact that was really annoying!) so be prepared for some issues to last over several episodes -__-\r\nArt: I loved the art of the anime. Seriously I cannot say anything bad about it because I really really and genuinely liked it :D \r\nSound:From what I heard about the manga, the OP would probably be suitable for the manga but definitely not (!) for the anime. The ED was okay, the background music not that special, and the OP was nice but didn't suit the mood of the anime itself at all (I skipped it 12 out of 13 times because I just could not stand it)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters...well...in the beginning I thought 'Oh they seem interesting and nice' and I was hopeful and curious...but then, just when you think you see some character development the characters go back to being the same old person they were in the beginning which is not only annoying but just makes me dislike them -___- \\n\r\nIt wouldn't be that much of an issue if the story pace was faster but unfortunately that's not the case so there were some episodes where I spend my time disliking ALL the main characters and just wanting to punch or yell at them...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: It is nice, not too good, not too bad. And even though there were so many things I didn't like, I have to say some aspects of it seemed realistic (for a shoujo anime) which made me enjoy it a little bit more. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I think Sukitte Ii na yo is highly overrated and definitely not a must-watch but it is a good recommendation if you like romance and have too much time on your hands...or if you really like the art ;D",

            "content": "Sukitte Ii na yo: a simple, carefree, cute and romantic anime. AND SERIOUS?\r\nIt follows Tachibana Mei, a shy, awkward and lonely girl who's never really experienced a positive relationship with 'friends.' She quotes many times throughout the anime that, \"friends will always let you down. They are never really there for you.\" (Not exactly like that, but you get the idea).\r\nNow Mei doesn't speak to anyone in school. So when the most popular boy in school, not to mention the most handsome boy, ends up getting on her bad side she pretty much kicks him in the face. From there, Yamato Kurosawa (the popular boy)is instantly intrigued by her. The anime is a story of their relationship and how he teaches her certain lessons in life she's disregarded till now.\\n\\n\r\nThe first episode is the real hook of the anime, (I won't spoil anything) but from there, there isn't much of an overall plot idea. The anime just continues to follow the relationship between Yamato and Mei. \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the overall enjoyment, I would have to say this anime kept me smiling and wishing for a boyfriend all the way through. It was cute and had romantic and giggly scenes that were also very heart-wrenching. But don't be fooled. The anime takes a very serious turn with the introduction of characters such as Aiko and Megumi. From there the anime focuses on the importance of self-love and dignity. I believed that the introduction of such a serious topic was brilliant and really made the person watching become more self-aware and learn much more about their life and themselves. \\n\\n\r\nI would heartily recommend this anime to anybody who is feeling down. It was capable of making me smile and laugh at my darkest moments, and those are dark. So 7/10 overall with a 9/10 rating in art- because I thought the art was so different and stunning. \\n\\n\r\nIt's worth a try and I promise, when you watch this anime, you'll never regret it.",

If i go into deep it would be a spoiler.\r\nThis anime is all about the hardships they been through to maintain their relationship as a couple. Their friends also helped them to recover from serious situations. some love triangle, some comedy, a perfect balance of romance comedy and drama, stillthis anime was nowhere near the level of clannad and after story as i didn't got any feelings towards it. After 3-4 episodes i got bored.\\n\r\nSomething is really odd about this anime, i hope you can understand what i am trying to say here.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway it is perfect for those who just wants to pass their time if they have got nothing else to watch.

The story was beautiful and sweet with some subtle drama for some moments. It went deeper than many similar anime by putting in topics like trying to lose weight and change your look to appeal to someone. The art and character design were perfect for the story. Though the soundtrack was not anything too memorable. For the characters, I immediately fell forYamato even though it is quite a clich\u00e9 archetype for the guy to be perfect in every way however his dark backstory was very tearjerking and made a lot of sense for his character. Mei is one of the few characters in the anime that got considerable development in a good way. Megumi was quite annoying in the beginning trying to ruin the MeixYamato ship but eventually got better as the series progressed. Overall this series was quite enjoyable to watch.",

This one didn't necessarily follow that scenario, like the butchering of Kaoru Mori's \"Emma,\" but it was still a bit on the irritating side because it altered some aspects of the story that I actually liked.\r\nFor instance, the grittiness of having Mei and Yamato actually spend the night alone in a hotel room, not with his sweet little sister gumming up the works. The manga had them be alone together, but the anime couldn't be that courageous. So,yeah, that was disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is gorgeous, and I really love Mei and Yamato together. They're just plain cute. But the manga is more in-depth, and deals with the plot on a more honest level. The anime is, quite frankly, white-washed. So, if you know that going in, you'll be fine. I sort of watched the anime first and then read the manga, which is probably why I still really like the anime.d of 1.",

Story-wise, although I can't remember too much, wasn't confusing at all and it was super heartwarming! It was a little predictable but I still loved it either way. There was a decent amount of fanservice which made me very happy, its something I don't see very often (at least in my experience). There was also some filler but nothing major as it's a short series. One thing though, the ending was god-awful. Itended so abruptly and it really wasn't good, but I don't think you shouldn't watch it just because of the ending.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style fits with the story, and I personally like the way it looks. Nothing too over the top but nothing too outstanding either. It can look a little funny at some times with some characters, just like with almost any other anime, so that doesn't ruin it. Overall the art is pretty and nice to look at.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting for the JA version fits decently well, it's not horrid (around the same level of the art). The opening wasn't super memorable but it was cute and I didn't feel compelled to skip it unlike some other intros. A majority of the music tracks didn't stand out, but others were really nice and fit well with the scenes. I'd listen to the OST if I didn't really have anything else I'd rather listen to.\\n\\n\r\nFrom what I can remember, the characters are good, and interact well with one-another. A bit one sided but nothing too outlandish. I do feel like the characters did grow and mature as the series progressed. \\n\\n\r\nAs a picky anime watcher this one really was enjoyable. Overall I'd reccomend this, it's a really great anime even if you don't watch much, like me.\\n",

I think you should watch it if you have time on your hands. Granted, there are much better animes than this, but it doesn't hurt to watch. Overall, I give it a fair 6.\r\nThe story is about a girl whose whole life was friendless- because of a bullying incident when she was young. She accidentally wrongfully kicks the most popular boy in school - but he starts to think she is interesting. He wants to know more about her, andalmost immediately, he starts falling for her. It is quite different from most slice-of-life animes in that their relationship started very quickly and they stayed together most of the show. One con though, is that I felt he sometimes treated her weird, for example, when he talked to her about making more friends in the restaurant. That's something a mother would say. \\n\\n\r\nNonetheless, the scenes are okay, it's not amazing but it's not downright horrible.\\n\r\nIt could've been much better, had the main girl,  mei, stay strong through the whole show.\\n\r\nAt the start, she was her own man's man, and she wasn't afraid of much. But somehow she becomes a very shy person later in the show.\\n\\n\r\nShould you watch it?\\n\\n\r\nDepends how much you care about quality-animes. I say watch it if you like bubbly- slice of life slow animes. \\n",

The story is basically just your basic romance story about a boy and a girl. But there is still something that made me enjoy myself while watching the show.\r\nSay I love you uses the basic form of romance anime where the most popular boy in the school fells in love with this not so popular girl. The story in itself isn't  anything special but the way it's made is hard to come by in the anime industry. Usually when it comes to romanceanime there isn't a lot of the dating scheme and it's more like just the boy trying to make the girl love him but in this anime you will find a lot of dating type of scenarios and the girl even tries to make the boy fell in love with her too. That's what made me enjoy this anime more than many of the other romance animes out there. \\n",

Due to this, at times it became repetitive and obvious, however I overall found myself enjoying most of this anime, expect for the times when it starts to lack attention to detail.\r\nPROS\r\nIt delivers on a good love story where we see both in the party grow. If you like the usual love story structure, popular guy falls for a shy girl then this should be right up your alley. It has many great character resolves which are predictable, however that's not always a bad thing.\r\nCONS\r\nSay \"I love you\" does lack insome aspects though. Some main characters lack resolve and elaboration, at times I wished that they would delve deeper into some characters as it feels on some occasions that once they put a few scenes of a character they just throw them away. This anime also lacks some direction at times and I personally did not enjoy the ending.\\n\\n\r\nShould you watch?\\n\r\nIf you are into this genre of anime then yes, it gives you mostly enjoyable content, however it lacks some polishing which ultimately doesn't ruin the main themes of the anime however leads to some less than satisfying moments.",

            "content": "This is one of (in my opinion) the best anime ever. This is mainly because of the characters, especially the main character, Mei. At the beginning of the anime she's a very big outsider and didn't have many friends, if any. She was very protective and got angry very quickly. She also had very little trust in people due to past events. However when she meets Yamato and starts to trust and like him, her personality changes. I also like how they made her hair grow longer to represent her becoming more friendly.\r\nOnce she meets Yamato she starts to get more friends but also usesYamato as an anchor. As Mei opens up she gets more popular. Personally, however, I liked her when she was more independent and badass, but she needed to rely on Yamato for the love story to progress. Mei is the perfect example of selflessness and cute bewildermen. Yamato is more confident but still has flaws due to his past.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I like about the story, is Yamato's younger sister. At first she didn't accept Mei as her brother's girlfriend. But once they both found out that they had a lot in common to fo with friend issues, Mei was able to help her and there were some really, really adorable scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has so many different characters with different personal problems and they somehow all lead back to Mei. You really connect to Mei and her emotions and at a couple of points your heart will actually break because of what happens to Yamato and Mei's relationship. \\n\\n\r\nThe art in this anime is one of my all time favourite styles, it's so beautiful and elegant but really clean too. They character's eyes are the best bit- they almost always are. Not only that but the scenery is really pretty especially because of the way they create the sun rays. That's the most summery thing in the world.\\n\\n\r\nThe music in it represents  the emotions Mei is feeling at the time perfectly and makes the atmosphere so much more devouring. Not only does the music connect with Mei's feelings but also the season they're currently in.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is a beautiful anime amd I recommend it to anyone who like cute fluffy romance\\n\r\nAnime.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nIt also has really cute cats =^_^=",

            "content": "I found this anime through recommendation from another Shoujo Anime, and finished it in one day (had spare time). I really enjoyed it and was surprised to see the score was quite low for this show so I decided to write a review.\r\nWhile this show isn't a master piece (score 9-10) objectively speaking, as it does has its flaws, I thought it was a very decent shoujo anime that should have deserved an 8 or 8+, so this review is sort of to argue about how I personally think the score should be higher for this show. Though legitametly speaking nobody is actually going toread this (sadly), so I am basically just putting my thoughts out. Well enough of the introduction and let us proceed.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nScore: (objectively: 8) (personal: 9)\\n\\n\r\nThis shows overall as well as minor plot structure is nothing new and quite simple. The over-arching story being: shy (&cute) girl meets nice bi-shounen, bishounen falls for her, and she falls for him. The heroine through the bi-shonen gets to know new people, and in each encounter she faces drama and grows in character.\\n\\n\r\n While the story is quite typical I found the playout of it to be quite good. While all the arcs are quite stereotypical in which heroine meets bad girl, then drama, heroine then befriends bad girl, makes bad girl good, and along the way the heroine also grows. I thought the sub arcs were executed quite good. All the sub arcs were quite fast and the heroine always quickly overcomes the social situation she faces. Leading to the audience never being quite bored.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I liked about the plot is that 65% of shoujo manga/anime take a long time for the main male and female to get together but in this show they got together quite early. So from the get-go of the show we got to see the pair experiencing the hardships of dating. Rather then a bunch of time being wasted on the pair trying to get together.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot of this show was not perfect though, as previously stated it is quite the typical shoujo story line, so yes indeed some points off there. And also while the short story arcs made the audience less bored, at the same time due to their short duration I feel like the story of the sub arcs as well as supporting character of the arcs were not developed as well. Though to the credit of the anime, they did show enough to make the plot flow and make sense.\\n\\n\r\nBut anyhow speaking of characters..... Let's transition to the next segment.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nScore: (Objective: 7) (Personal: 8)\\n\\n\r\nWell let's first talk about the supporting cast as I feel that will be easier. Well the thing is, there isn't that much to talk about as they were all the typical side character tropes. Given the short duration of the arcs for these side characters they weren't developed as much, and we didn't get to know them so indepth. Only one side character was more of an overarching villain so was developed and flushed out more.\\n\\n\r\nBut in my personal opinion just because the supporting cast is typical that doesn't mean I have to rate the character segment of the show down. While the supporting cast may have been typical, there was nothing particularly bad about them. And to their credit, there were moments in which one of the side characters did play quite the decent role of supporting the main pair, so much so that she once called out the male lead for being a dick (really liked that part personally).\\n\\n\r\nAnyhow the show's main focus is on the heroine (and the male lead) so that is what I'll be judging the character segment mostly on. The heroine was also quite a typical shoujo heroine character, but personally i found her to be appealing. She had a good, honest personality making you want to care for her and watch her story. And through out the anime compared to other shoujo heroines she didn't whine as much and always faced her problems quite fast. Her character also developed a significant amount.\\n\\n\r\nIf we simply focused on the heroine character I would've given the character segment an 8 but due to the problem with the supporting cast and the male lead I gave it a 7.\\n\\n\r\nSo regarding the main male, well I don't particularly like him. Throughout the show he was portrayed as your typical nice guy and despite being the main male character, in contrast to the heroine, his character did not develop at all what so ever. In fact the only ripples we see in his nice guy character is when he became a hypocrite or insensitive ass. And hence causing me to dislike him and lose enjoyment on the show. Therefore lowering the character segment score from 8 to 7.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nScore: (objective & personal: 8)\\n\\n\r\nThis is a slice of life shoujo show so you aren't going to be seeing some crazely well animated fight scene, and shouldn't expect it. But through out the anime the animation was smooth and nothing to complain about.\\n\\n\r\nThe backgrounds for the show though was done quite nicely and due to this their were some nice frames that would make for great wallpaper.\\n\\n\r\nMoreover I personally like the character design very much. Some shoujo anime like to overdue their \"shoujo aura\" and make the character design sort of exagerrated in a shoujo sense (for example with the eyebrows and lips) (shoujo fans know what I am talking about), this show doesn't do that making the characters all quite pleasant for the eyes. The character design isn't sooo shoujo that it scare off non-shoujo fans and hence is pleasant as stated.\\n\\n\r\nMusic:\\n\r\nScore: (Objective & Personal: 7)\\n\\n\r\nThe only part of this show that I was not entertained by was the OST, and if we were only going off the OST I would've marked the music segment quite low. In the OST for the show there wasn't any outstanding tracks nor could I say it added or complimented to the show. Basically OST was bland and hence bad.\\n\\n\r\nBut the saving grace were the themes songs. The OP was quite nice, but most of the ED was great.\\n\\n\r\nThe ED was done by Suneohair and that should say enough. I've known the band from other animes and I like them. I am not particularly knowledgeable about music so I can't give an indepth reason to why it's good but well I'll just say I personally liked it a lot.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nScore: 10\\n\\n\r\nI personally love the shoujo romance genre, so to me the plot being a typical shoujo romance is not a minus but rather a major plus. The usual main problem I have with this genre is whether the heroine is annoying or if this was a plain reverse harem show (which I dislike). But for this anime the heroine wasn't annoying nor was there a reverse harem. And hence I loved it and enjoyed it greatly.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.6 if I average the scores but objectively speaking I'd say more of an 8.1.\\n\\n\r\nThis show isn't very very unique or has a special twist or super indepth an story that would make it one of those legendary shoujo manga/animes. But it isn't downright bad or unenjoyable in anyway.\\n\\n\r\nFor shoujo fans that watch a lot of shoujo anime and have or finished all the classics I feel this could be a very decent addition to the repertoire. If you enjoy the genre there is nothing particularily bad that should turn you away from the good old same old.\\n\\n\r\nAnd even for non-shoujo fans too, there isn't anything to dislike about the show so much so that you can't enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nSo hence I definitely thing the shoujo should bottom line have an 8 score, given that for the typical MAL-er, a show being below an 8 means being shit. \\n\\n\r\nFor those who have read so much of my shitty writing to this point I appreciate and thank you very much. Hope you have a nice day too haha lol\\n\\n\\n\\n",

And story is just that, too.\r\nIt's not below standard, mind you, it's just that \"another romance story of popular boy falls for very unpopular girl\". There's everything you can expect from that setting, and nothing more.\r\nI admit to dropping the series at 9 episodes mark, as I couldn't see any sensible reason for watching the remaining4 episodes.

However, after a traumatic incident when her \"friends\" abandoned her, Mei's idea of friendship completely changed forever and she stopped having friends and trusting them (Tachibana-san and I kind of resemble each other...). In orderto not get hurt again, Mei decides to stay away from people as much as possible, and she doesn't want anything to do with having friendships or relationships with any one. During her current life in high school, everyone thought of her as gloomy and stoic. However, as fellow student Yamato Kurosawa\u2014one of the most popular boys in her high school\u2014decides to intrude into her quiet life, Mei begins to question whether or not her choices to distance herself were indeed the right ones.\\n\\n\r\nStory (8/10):\\n\r\nI-I can seriously relate to Tachibana-san. I-I can remember when I have been hurt by people who I have considered to be my friends. Even my own family has betrayed me sometimes...b-but I'm also envious of Tachibana-san because she has someone like Kurosawa-kun (n-not the fact that he's handsome...! >////<) to be there for her and teach her how to love herself....I-I honestly wish that I had that for myself.\\n\\n\r\nArt and design (7/10):\\n\r\nI-i think that the art of this anime was really thought out and beautiful. W-what made me happy about the art of this anime is that Kurosawa-kun and Tachibana's relationship is really beautiful even though they are both different and similar in their own ways. *blushes* I-i guess that you can say that...o-opposties attract...?\\n\\n\r\nSound Effects (8/10):\\n\r\nI-i really don't have an opinion on the sound effects because I believe that it's the same as all romance and slice of life anime. B-but...it is unique in its own way.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9/10):\\n\r\n*blushes deeply* L-like I said before...I-i really can relate to Tachibana-san because our past experiences are similar to one another. We both have had controlling and unbearing fathers, friends who have betrayed us...b-but we also have the same shy personality. I-i believe that if Tachibana-san was in my world or me in hers, I believe that we could become very good friends. Also, K-kurosawa-kun is very loving and caring towards Tachibana-san...I hope that all goes well for those two.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI would recommend this anime to anyone who is interested in romance, drama, and slice of life. I believe that anyone who can relate to Tachibana-san would reallly come to love this anime.",

It really has a great story and actually teaches us a lesson about bullying as well with a lot of moments where you would feel sorry for the main character and can make you want to punch the dude. I will say it again this anime is quite realistic in a sense of romance and emotional not all whacky and laughing but it does have its fair share of them. I would Recommend it because this could really helpyou feel about your future partner's feelings and could make you really understand how bad cheating on someone really is. So really I find it highly recommendable and would be a good idea to just watch through it all",

However the ending, the goddamned ending ruined it all for me. Episode 12 would have substituted as an OK ending compared to the horrid episode 13 ending. If the ending was better this anime would be a 9 for me. The ending was way too bland and did not take a step forward with Mei and Yamato, this might be due to them starting off too quickly? I don't know. It feels like thecreators just got too lazy and were like f*ck it lets get this over with as fast as possible. I do not dislike the anime, I dislike the ending. Overall the anime has a good message and is in a way unique for a romance anime. \\n",

No. There were LOADS OF KISSES!!! from the get go!lol (I mean what is a shoujo love story without all the shoujo elements we love?? Kisses are key.hahaha) What I loved about this anime-my precious kisses aside, was that it was about after the guy gets the gal. The what happens next. I appreciated that. I also loved how close it was to reality. That was refreshing. The themes oflove, friendship, self-esteem and trust were well brought out. It was a beautiful, sweet, calm-paced story.\\n\\n\r\nArt was very beautiful and fluid. I liked the colors. Fitting for a shoujo anime about love.\\n\\n\r\nSound was amazing too. Loved the voice acting.\\n\\n\r\nOverall enjoyment: I think the 9 score is a dead give away.lol Highly recommended if you're looking for something cute and sweet but also mature.",

            "content": "I've read quite a few reviews about this anime and the general consensus is that the plot follows the generic plot of any other shoujo. The school's most unpopular girl hooks up with the school's hottest guy and thus, a surprising romance is formed... not. We've all seen this before and Sukitte Ii na yo is nothing new. \r\nHowever, what separates Sukitte from other shoujo anime that follows this plotline such as Tonari, Kimi Ni Todoke and Kaichou-Wa Maid-Sama, is its down-to-earth feeling. Unlike the other shoujo animes, Sukitte does not have comedy in it. It is completely focused on the relationship between the twoprotagonists, something that is often forgotten in other romances. While some may be put off by this, just know that this anime is not supposed to be a Rom-Com.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the anime also addresses some actual real life problems that occur in a daily high school student's life. As a high school student myself, this is where the anime truly hit home. The want to be accepted, to the point where you have to cover yourself up and create a personality different from the true you. When your classmates are already sleeping together and you question whether if it's you that is the odd one out. The anime includes all of these situations and you just have to wonder how the awkward and introverted main character deals with these problems.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, while the synopsis of Sukitte creates the impression that this anime is another generic shoujo anime, do not be fooled. Sukitte is a beautiful and well-designed anime. It strays from the general shoujo storyline and will more likely appeal to those who can relate to being new to romance during high-school.",

            "content": "Plot 7/10\r\nTo someone who isn't used to shoujo anime and manga, the plot is decent but to someone who's read alot of the genre the plot isnt that original. Its full of some cliches such as, \"A rival appears and falls in love with the heroine\", and \"A rival appears and falls in love with the hero\" and stuff like that. Although it has all these elements the plot still holds up and makes the story enjoyable.\r\nCharacters 7/10\r\nThe characters are actually really fun and relate-able. At first Mei's personality is weak in the beginning of the anime, as the story progresses she becomes much strongeras a person and begins to enjoy herself more opening up chances for comedic relief and taking some of the drama out of the series. The antagonists and her friends are a little cliche but their personalities and background stories are unique in their own ways and they will make develop different emotions toward them the more they interact with Mei.\\n\r\nEx// frustration, anger, etc\\n\\n\r\nSound 6/10\\n\r\nI'm sorry the sound in this was dreadful. I know they used slow music to complement the mood of the anime however both the OP and the EP are extremely slow and boring. I don't think I even got through 10 whole seconds of any of them however I'm sure some people enjoy but it wasnt my cup of tea.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\r\nThe art in \"Say I Love You\" leans more on the realistic side but keeps its anime appeal. The backgrounds are beautiful and since this falls under the shoujo genre the characters are well detailed. Overall the art is great.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10\\n\r\nSukitte Li Na Yo. is a melodramatic anime that explorers the relationships of a girl named Mei and how she struggles to trust people and open up her heart due to bullying early on. Through her time spent with Yamato she begins to grow as a person which ultimately allows her to start enjoying her school life and make friends. I recommend this anime to any shoujo lovers or people who like romance anime but I wouldn't recommend it to people who hate dramatic stuff like clannad etc becomes 99% of it is just that. Altogether I give it a 7/10. It has its flaws but its a great watch.",

I would recommend this show to the people just starting in the romance/drama genre.\r\nIn my opinion the show moved a long quite fast. Its not a bad thing at all, especially for this show. To me, I didn't see any unneeded developments though the story. Considering this is in the drama genre of anime there were character introductions I didn't like because they interfered with the relationship of the two people. (That's just me though.) \r\nAs a romance I thinkit did a pretty good job with the amount of episodes they were given to work with. The two main people in this show seem like polar opposites. The girl (Mei Tachibana) being someone that keeps her distance from everyone because she thinks friends only bring pain to ones self, Then the guy (Yamato Kurosawa) seems to be this handsome guy that every girl in the school has their eyes on with the fact that he is super popular. \\n\\n\r\nThe art style of the show seemed to be of any typical Shoujo anime. But of course ZEXCE added its own styles to it like the eyes, hair, and of course the kisses. I didn't have a problem with the animation of the show, in fact i loved it!\\n\\n\r\nAs you could tell I really liked this show if not loved it. I do recommend this show. It was a good enjoyable romance that caught my eye. The name Sukitte ii na yo meaning \"Say I Love You\" grabbed me the most out of everything because I don't see many animes that have the word love in it and not be a romantic comedy. \\n\\n\r\nSo over all it made me happy that I watched this show and it showed me even a good romance story can be told in 12-13 episodes.",

Just so eveybody can know how awesome is Sukitte ii na yo, i need more animes like this!\\n\\n\r\nIf there are any grammars errors above, understant that english is not my native language :P\\n\\n\r\nIf you are thinking, should I watch this?\\n\\n\r\nWatch it!\\n\\n\r\nBut don't blame me if you become depressed in some episodes XD",

So I make jokes now, I plan to do standup for my mama she's ill now, very tired all the time and tells me to fetch medicine from the hospital using car, which I cannot drive). Yamato is opposite, he's outgoing and is unlikely match. They hit it off and have many fun times. Animationquality is good, I don't understand Japanese so I had to make up own story. 8/10.",

In fact, she's been picked on and mistreated so many times in the past that she's given up on the idea of friendships at school, much less a relationship with a boy. Meanwhile, Kurosawa Yamato, one of the most popular boys at school is being swarmed by pretty girls all vying for his attention. He notices Mei after she lashes out at someone pranking her and accidentally \"round-house kicks\" him intothe wall. Afterwards, he becomes intrigued with her. She wears no make-up, her hair is messy and short, and she extremely defensive and skeptical of all of her classmates, including him. The story unfolds from there, and is just beautiful to watch and enjoy. If you've ever been a person wishing you could meet a popular person in school but felt they were out of your league, this story will give you hope for humanity. Just loved it. 9/10 definitely.",

When you watch the first couple of episodes, you build high expectations because the story is good and the drama is great but it progressively flattens out. The main character Tachibana Mei is extremely annoying and very unlikable and by the end of the series she gets 0 development. And the main male character Yamato is not that hot yet he's portrayed as such. On a hotness scale of 1-10 he's a solid 3 but then again it's a matter of taste I guess.\r\nThe plot is actually really good and they couldhave made it so much better had the characters had any development at all. At the end, Mei is still the same negative passive girl despite having outside encouragement and good friends who cheered her on. Honestly, the light of this show is Aiko-san who is a very strong independent female that don't take no sh*t. She is easily one of my favorite anime characters ever. Too bad she wasn't the main person.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, it gets a 5 from me for the huge let down.",

            "content": "Story: If you're looking for a romance that describes the ups and downs of a relationship but at the same time focuses on two broken souls, you're in luck. And guess what. There's no fanservice in sight (this is in case you haven't checked the genre section of the show yet). Okay, story. Mei Tachibana is a high school student who grew up to be alone since her friends betrayed her when she was a child. However, a miracle occurs when she meets her high school's most popular boy, Yamato Kurosawa, and he falls in love with her. Then, it's your classic shojo shenanigans, butwhat does make this different is that Yamato has to break down his walls in order for Mei to break down hers. I know I just described every other romantic shojo ever, but if I explain anymore, it would just spoil the show. I promise that it's original in some light because it does have interesting side stories. Score: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: The animation is so cute and for something very simple, it's very clean, and it does present what the story is telling the audience. When there is a funny scene, the art does match that without breaking apart from the rest of the animation as if it's a different show. With its soft colors matching its calm yet somewhat emotional tone, it makes it something beautiful to look at instead of using it as an anime to listen to as background music while doing your homework. Definitely a 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The soundtrack is beautiful because of the calm setting the show mostly has. No score is set out of place at all. The only thing I really have to mention to you all because I'm obsessed with it is that the opening has to be one of the most beautiful openings I have ever listened to in my entire life. The opening's purpose is to pull you into the spirit of the show, and Say, I Love You's opening does that extremely well. Though I don't think the ending is just as catchy, it does match what the ending to each episode is, and there's nothing I can really complain about with it. 10/10 it is.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Every character from this show has got some insecurity they have to overcome, and at least they have an episode or two dedicating to overcoming it because of the main characters. Of course, you have Mei, your introvert, who would rather be alone than get involved in drama, who also ends up being cherish by someone she doesn't really know because he admires her courage, strong will, and moral values. Yamato has to be one of the cutest male love interests I have ever seen in a long time. He acts like your stereotypical, calm male lead, but he also has a past that everyone seems to only tell Mei just to scare her off and give him to the other girls who think deserve him better. What I love the most about Yamato is that whenever Mei does confront him about what others are saying, he doesn't even hide it. He'll be completely honest with her, and he'll do anything to make it up to the one person he cares about. The side characters are also very enjoyable to watch. My favorite side character has to be Asami. She's just this ball of energy who ends up friending Mei because Asami's pretty much an outcast herself, but for a different reason. Their friendship is so genuine that you actually want them to stay friends when in other anime, the friendship is there for connivence and continuance of the plot. There are plenty of more characters that'll take me forever to describe, but I promise you won't be disappointed in this category. Score: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Though it might be slow at times, just watching life happen can be pretty interesting. Unlike other romance anime of this type, Say I Love You goes through the real life of teenagers when it comes to self worth or true love. You see a lot of physical insecurities because many of the characters try to hard to look the part in order to mentally play the part. I suppose that's what makes Mei the hero of the show because physical appearance is the least of her focus and she confronts others to just be themselves instead of playing teenage actresses or actors. When other anime just shows the couple having small issues and treating them like it's the end of the world, but with this show, it's so real that you just get sucked into the lives of the characters and want them to have happy endings. In short, 10/10 again, man.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I pretty much said what I wanted to say. I highly recommend this series to any romance fan or any anime fan in general for its beautiful story and relatable characters. With all that, the overall score is a rounded 10/10.",

Once I completed it I didn't want to watch any other anime (romance or not) because I didn't want to let go of the adorable characters and their story that makes you say \"awww\". Many people have made this anime underrated, but I don't believe it should be that way! The soundtrack to this anime makes me feel very nostalgic to this series to, it's not annoying at all and it's not to sorrowful, even though it makes me very reflective. I started to listen to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5j1RCys4R0g when I finished watching this season ofanime so everything I listen to it now it reminds me of say I love you. I also watched K-on! And the The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya before for this, but I ditched and dropped them both because they just weren't my style. Say I love you is definately my style. So to conclude my review and to top it all off, I love Say \"I love you\".",

This series presents a really calm and slow atmosphere, and is enjoyable to watch. It is certainly enjoyable to watch Mei come out of her shell as a tsundere female, with the help of Yamato. \r\nThe character development of the anime is very good, not only with Mei, but with those you don't expect and faces issues such as body issues, depression and just an awkward romance. It is very dramatic, but it keeps you watching. \r\nIt has it's highs and itslows and though it is mainly about watching Mei Tachibana come out of her shell as she is in a relationship with Yamato, you watch her overcome those hurdles, aswell as learning new things about each character each episode and everyones quite dark pasts. But like any teenage anime things do get thrown out of proportion and Mei's inability to say whats on her mind can get annoying, but overall is an enjoyable anime.\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend it to anyone who enjoys drama, slice of life romance animes as they will thoroughly enjoy it.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Having just finished re-watching it for the umpteenth time, I can confidently say that this anime holds it's spot unwaveringly among my favorites. \r\nThere is something so pure and innocent about the relationship between Mei and Yamato, not to mention among the rest of the characters. There was no complex plot to this like a lot of magical girl animes or other genres and styles, it went straight to the point and told a story I wanted to hear: the story of your everyday high school love, a love that can actually be attainable to the rest of us in the world. It gives youhope, of finding someone that you can share yourself and your feelings with, of finding happiness with. There is conflict and sadness, but also good. It really give you something to relate to, no matter which character you empathize or emulate with. \\n\\n\r\nI could mostly relate to Aiko and Mei, with their normal, everyday problems quite similar to my own. That has to be the best part of this anime and manga. It's telling a story, a real story. There are no action scenes to force the suspense or adrenaline, no dramatic scandal to build the anxiety. What happens in this plot line is real, it's something you can naturally build anticipation with without wearing yourself out trying to keep up. I have not seen anything this sweet or youthful in a while. Will be watching this one again, and again, and again, very soon. \\n\\n\r\nThe only downside I can add about this anime is that the live action movie did not do the series justice. It was cute, and mostly true to the story, but it cut out too much of the scenes and incidents that made this anime the relatable piece it was. Not to mention did it leave a lot untold about the relationships and where they ended up. It was average, to say the least. Having One Direction's \"Happily\" as the closing to the movie was strange too. I wouldn't watch it again, especially with rather unemotional performances. I'll stick to the anime version if I want to watch it over read it.",

There were so many twists and turns throughout the whole show that made me want to continue watching just so that Icould find out what happened next. \\n\\n\r\nThe art I give a 8/10 rating. The reason for this is because, throughout the whole thing, most of the female characters looked exactly alike except for their hairstyles.

            "content": "Sukitte Ii na yo -- \"Say I love you\" is a very typical romance anime that doesn't deviate too much from the normal romance story. The main character, Tachibana Mei, is your average reserved high school girl who's been through some drama in her life and deals with it in a very usual manner. The story can become really easy to predict at most points and that is actually my only issue with the series; I sometimes found myself getting zoned out because I was predicting the events of the series too well.\r\nI enjoy the art direction of the series; it's very bright and animationsare pretty fluid. Character development, while very quick, is very realistic. Though at sometimes Mei's character irritated me. But that is typical with most reserved characters for me. For the most part, the main characters are pretty interesting. The side characters weren't as interesting unfortunately.\\n\\n\r\nIf you haven't watched a romance anime before, \"Sukitte Ii na yo\" is a good place to start as it doesn't get too ridiculous and wouldn't overwhelm newcomers to the genre.",

The story might not be something new in the anime world, but it still has a special place in my heart because once the feelings reach beyond the flat screen that's all that matters. And that's what Sukitte Iinayo does best!\r\nThe characters aren't really too original, but they still have something unique that distinguish them from the rest - well, some of them do. And they aren't uni-dimensional, each sharing a good part as well as a bad one. Their pastshad a big part in building who they are now and it was nice to learn about who they used to be and who they are now. And while these past stories are presented to us, the relationship between are main characters evolves little by little. Oh, did I forget to mention that they start their relation pretty early in the anime so you won't have to wait 10 episodes for a kiss? But they still have obstacles to encounter like any other love relation.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is really pretty and just my type. The light softly changes and it fits the atmosphere quite perfectly. Oh, and we have lots of kitties so that definitely is a plus for me! The music is suitable for the show and quite lovely, as for the voice actors they are just perfect for their characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is really great and lovely if you prefer romance shoujo anime and if you don't expect it to break any boundaries. It's a pretty good watch and once it gets you it won't let you go!",

It's a character made for as much as possible people identifythemselves with her and her problems, nevertheless, she's cute and her timidity is what calls atention to her.\\n\r\nYamato is that guy all women search for, secure, beautiful, popular and careful, and can you feel he's a nice guy, that like to help people and try to make good friends.\\n\\n\r\nThe main point that called my atention to this anime is how a nice guy changes a strange and timid girl to a better person with love. And it's true love that they feel. The problems they have during the story are all real problems and it shows how relationships goes on, either in a fiction or in the real.\\n\r\nThe other part that is really interesting to see is how the human behavior can be. It shows a lot of how can a person use a false mask in front of others just to appear as the best and how it goes down in front of the real love and friendship.\\n\\n\r\nThe simple things from the life of any person in the world makes this anime nice to watch. Since from the timidity of a girl to the behavior of different people together.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyned it a lot and if you like animes who tells a romantic and realistic story of people, sit and watch it, you'll like it for sure!\\n\\n\r\nIt's my first review here, sorry for some problems that it might have and I wish you all like it.",

And believe me - 8 episodes is more than enough to know, that it indeed is a crap. I will tell you why.\r\nThe male protagonist is known to be a notorious womanizer. He doesn't hide this fact, nor does he think his actions are wrong in any way; \"he does what he wants, when he wants\" and \"he kissed almost every girl in school\".\r\nThe female protagonist knows about allthat, but she still decides he is worth her time. Why? Because she gets the kiss numer 4!\\n\r\nThe explanation of his kisses from episode two:\\n\r\n1 - the kiss used as a greeting\\n\r\n2 - only cute girls get this one\\n\r\n3 - the kiss for someone he wants to go further with\\n\r\n4 - the kiss with profound feelings\\n\r\nSo, if your boyfriend goes and kisses everybody, you shouldn't have a problem with that, because, only you get the kiss with profound feelings!\\n\r\nNice.\\n\r\nNow, the fans of this show would propably shout \"but he changed!\" Unfortunatelly it isn't really true. In the anime it isn't said that he changed. There is one time we can witness him denying his ex a romantic relationship, but he never needed a romantic relationship with a girl to kiss her.\\n\\n\r\nIf that wasn't enough to convince you this is a crap, please read on - there is more.\\n\\n\r\nThe female protagonist's small development is unrealistic and forced, but what's the saddest is that all of couple's problems occur because of her inability to communicate.\\n\r\nTo show you an example: after two terrible episodes of her being a sad idiot she finally decides to communicate her feelings of jealousy. So what does she do? She runs to her boyfriend, kisses him, runs away, and again turns to her monosyllabic self.\\n\r\nSeriously, throughout the series their conversations were as meaty as a vegan sandwich.\\n\\n\r\nLast but not least, are the idiotic actions of people in this anime. Example: little sister sees her brother embracing his girlfriend. So it's completely normal that she shouts \"My big brother is in danger!\", isn't it? Well, for this anime it is completely normal, as well as are other utterly idiotic scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSo do yourself a favor, and go watch some good anime romance.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I have to say that I thought I would enjoy this anime more than I did.\r\nJust judging from the first episode there seemed to be a lot more potential in Mei's character than what eventually came across. While I'm sure it could be argued that Mei reacted well within an acceptable standard for a very distrusting and socially isolated person, I felt that that, coupled with Yamato's own insecurities, meant that the plot fitted itself into an almost mind-numbing loop. Throughout the series I was always holding out for those painfully infrequent glimpses of a confident Mei, who appeared in flashes but never stuck aoundlong enough to be anything more than a brief moment of satisfaction. Mei was sweet, caring, shy, but she wasn't very interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot (the mind-numbing loop) is, of course, very simple once you get down to it. Popular boy meets unpopular girl, sparks fly, love follows. The End. That does not mean I dislike the plotline, just that the plot, like many others, is very simple once you get down to it. It's the bits in between, and the part where 'Sukitte ii na yo' ultimately fails, that count. Basically what I'm saying is that if you notice the the underlying plotline while watching or reading any work of fiction, then you're probably not going to enjoy it very much. Especially if the plot is essentially just a clich\u00e9.\\n\r\nIn my opinion, the only reason 'Sukitte Ii na yo' flopped was because the main characters never really developed in any meaningful fashion. Mei and Yamato were very similar to eachother, especially in the sense of doubting their relationship on what amounted to flimsy evidence at best. Of course it was Mei more than Yamato, but while it was ridiculously normal for Mei, Yamato's doubts sprang forth inconceivably. It was, on the whole, a very disfunctional relationship that wasn't very compelling.",

Sadly, it didn't live up to expectations.\r\nThe story itself was quite simple, the challenges the characters face uninteresting, cliched, and the outcomes predictable. Every support character was so one dimensional, the story playing out like something from a teenage girl's diary.\r\nOnly the main character, Mei, was interesting enough to keep me going, which is a credit to the series. There are moments where you really feel for her. But, in the end,there isn't much else to go on.\\n\\n\r\nNot the worst thing I've ever seen, but certainly not the best.",

But in reality, it's so much deeper than that. It's about love, and friendship. I know that sounds cliche, but it isn't.\r\nArt 10/10\r\nI love the art in this. The art is just beautiful and fluid and gorgeous, and the surroundings are detailed. I love the dark color scheme in this. The art is just plain beautiful.\r\nSound 9/10 \r\nThe OT and ET are beautiful. I especially love the opening theme, \"Friendship.\" It just describes the series perfectly. The themes are nostalgic,and fit the series perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nStory 8/10\\n\r\nI gave the story an 8/10 because the story is typical in a romance anime, but yet it isn't. The story has many twists and turns, and has beautiful romance in it. But it's nothing romance lovers haven't seen before.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime, and I think other people will too. It's truly a fantastic anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I gave it a 9. I encourage others to try this anime. It will jerk your heart strings but yet still make you smile. It's a very unique anime. Try it!",

The anime revolves around one central relationship but on-the-low follows about 4 others as they, for the most part, follow the usual story-line (happiness, trouble, happiness). This anime became significant  to me after I came to the realization that every episode provided an interesting plot twist and left you dying for more. \r\nNow forspecifics. This anime gives of a Fruit Baskets type vibe, if you've watched it, and adds to the sentimental feeling you're left with.\\n\r\nI loved that the personalities of each character they are unique in their own sense while also being realistic. that realistic effect helps make the anime feel that much more personal.\\n\r\nThe creator did a great job in making sure that there were enough distractions to lengthen the series into 13 amazing episodes but leaves you feeling full by tying up all the loose ends by the end of the series. if you like love stories, you HAVE to add that to your \"to watch list\".",

Although the characters aren\u2019t as interesting to me as the more lovable bunch of My Little Monster, they probably live in a more realistic world. Sex is more casual here; something that for some of the characters is more of an option than not (although it seems to be contained to either a character\u2019s past, or to more unsavory characters). The biggest strength of it for me is simply about watching the main character open herself up to experience, and realize that she can trustpeople. Which includes romance and friendship and good things. It\u2019s the same idea as Kimi ni Todoke, but less accomplished. Still, I eat stuff like this up most of the time.\\n\\n\r\ncopied/pasted from my blog: www.thenextthingblog.wordpress.com",

The anime cuts out all the ecchi parts because it won't be really nice to show them while the manga shows them. I'm not saying I like ecchi (I don't) but the point is that, the anime should show some interest in showing just BEFORE it happens because it'll be more realistic. They talk openly about relationship, friendship and sex but the anime doesn't portray that part.What's more, they cut out some emotional parts, in which I was looking forward to watching them.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, I love the seiyuus and the voice acting.

I do enjoy a good love story every now and then because it does you some good. \r\nThe Story (8/10): \r\nWell it revolves around our main character, Yamato, winning over Mei (the girl that has had no REAL friends her whole life) and he struggles a littlebit but gets through that pretty early. The rest is their fight to maintain the relationship and their struggles to change themselves and those around them. \\n\\n\r\nThe Art (9/10): \\n\r\nI did very well enjoy the way this anime looked. It had a great style and I liked the way the characters were drawn. The ONLY thing I didn't like, though this was just a small thing I noticed, was that most of the characters (in fact, I can't think of one who didn't) had brown eyes. Now, I am not sure if that is how it is in Japan since this is supposed to be more realistic than having a girl with purple eyes or something but I just seemed to notice that. \\n\\n\r\nThe Sound (8/10):\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was appropriate for the tone of each moment, though not very memorable. I did love the opening theme because it was a rather soothing song. The voice acting though was great and definitely matched the tone and emotion of the situations. \\n\\n\r\nThe Characters (9/10):\\n\r\nThe characters had great development for each of them and no matter how much you came to hate one character, something was revealed as to why they were that way and you began to feel for them. There was one in particular that I actually didn't think could recover into a likable character but she did, for me at least. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10):\\n\r\nThis obviously is just my opinion and how I felt about it. Though most of this is just my opinion other than when I state something direct about the characters or story.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10):\\n\r\nI loved this anime and would recommend it to anyone that enjoys romance anime. I do enjoy myself a straight up romance every now and then so this was good for me. \\n\\n\r\nHope this was helpful for at least one person!",
