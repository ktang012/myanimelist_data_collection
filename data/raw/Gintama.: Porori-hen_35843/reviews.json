            "content": "This is my second full review on this site. \r\nI want a life for Christmas.\r\nLet me first address the minority among you, the ones actually wanting to know whether Gintama is worth watching - the ones looking for a proper review. Everybody knows the type - every time a season begins or concludes, a few of these pop out of the woodwork looking to \"get into Gintama\" or \"catch up with Gintama\" or whatever. I've had a number of them irl as well.\r\n I understand your confusion. For every 10/10 review claiming Gintama is the best thing since frozen bread, there are probably 5 userswith it being dropped, a score of 1/10, and an incredibly helpful tag of \"overrated\". Every time you decide to take the plunge, a voice in your head asks you - is it truly going to be worth it? In that 300+ episode runtime, you could be doing something useful (or watching other anime, I don't really care) - are you going to invest that time on poop jokes?\\n\\n\r\nTruth is, I can't help you, and I don't think anyone can.\\n\\n\r\nI will say this - when Gintama peaks, it is going to be one of the best anime you've ever seen. It will fully deserve that overblown 9+ score, which ranks it above other hot favorites and makes people salty. It's when it peaks that causes all the polarization, in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nSay you don't like toilet humor. Then for you, the show might peak during its parody bits.\\n\\n\r\nI also know some who consider references to be the lowest form of comedy. Maybe the self-deprecating gags or the ones parodying tropes instead of other media are more your cup of tea.\\n\\n\r\n\"I don't really like anime comedy but I'm checking Gintama out coz of its high score\" - the action arcs might be where the show peaks for you. (Seriously though the score doesn't make it less of a comedy)\\n\\n\r\nThese are only a few examples but the point I'm trying to make is Gintama is mixed bag of  goodies which aren't limited to a single style or genre. The more among them you like, the more you are inclined to like the show as a whole, and vice versa. \\n\r\n Consequently, there is no teaser for Gintama - X episodes you can watch that will tell you exactly what the show is. People might say the show gets good after a certain episode - I think that's more of them finding the first instance where the show peaked for them.  I dare say your experience would be different.\\n\\n\r\nThis isn't to say don't watch Gintama. But barreling through the show expecting 9+ quality right from the start will more often that not turn you away.\\n\r\nOne possible way to watch is to get to know the main cast (~10 episodes) then check out some of the top comedy episodes (there probably are a few threads listing them here and there) - if you like them, great, the show has a definite peak for you, and you can decide to keep watching or not. If you don't, well, 300 episodes is honestly a lot, and most of it is comedy of the same or lower quality.\\n\\n\r\nOnto this season then.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, this season was just regular Gintama. There were good episodes and bad episodes, similar to the previous seasons. Bad episodes, however, seem much more prominent when the season is 13 episodes, compared to 50 or 200. Variances in quality have been present throughout Gintama's run, and I don't necessarily feel this season is weak at least in terms of source material.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest negative for me is the existence of a \"Slip Arc\" when it could have been adapted in order, with perhaps a break before SA began. I also expected the characters to make a lot more fun of the honestly moronic decision to skip stuff.  Whatever. I've made my peace with BNP. Getting a complete adaptation is not something very common, and I suppose I should count my blessings.\\n\\n\r\nThe lack of budget saving background shots still irks me, though. It probably is fucking weird to want fillers, but the self parody segments were one of the biggest positives of Gintama comedy. The humor itself is great, but the love the staff felt for the show really shines through in the bonus segments, like Gintoki getting sleep paralysis for example. I just don't get that from any of the BNP seasons, not just this one. The switch from Sunrise to BNP makes me feel like overseeing an employee who went from giving 110% to 100%. I can't really complain, but I'm still disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nIn any case, whatever my feelings about BNP are, with the multi-colored poop segment of the Excalibur arc I can finally say unironically that I lost brain cells while watching Gintama. I appreciate the fact that they were trying to stick to the manga, which didn't have mosaics. But I can't believe that no one looked at the final product and went, \"hey, this is unbelievably fucking stupid!\" Or they did, and the staff just ran with it anyway. Lampshade stupid things, for god's sake. Make a character say that rainbow poop is shitty, no pun intended. It's moments like these where BNP refuses to utilize the reputation Gintama has built up over the years which make me hate them. Combine this with the ever-present janky zoomed out scenes -  or scenes where the camera focuses on the background instead of the characters - to save budget instead of just airing the fucking static BG, and there's no love lost between me and BNP.\\n\\n\r\nI don't mean for this to turn into another rant - I've accepted that this is the best we're going to get. This season is still weak, but for me it's more due to these small shortcomings that add up instead of the comedy being weaker or stale. I just hope this reduced budget goes to animating the multitude of fights in the SS arc in gloriously high quality. I want Gintama to go out with a bang, not fizzle towards its end.\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr - same Gintama comedy, weaker execution, basically another BNP season 8/10\\n\\n",

You\u2019re probably invested in the characters, not to mention the buildup to the finale that has gradually been revealed through the last two arcs. \r\nThis arc isn\u2019t like that. It\u2019s the slip arc, which actually takes place before the farewell shinsengumi arc, so you can expect to see old faces here. (I\u2019m talking the Shinsengumi, Otsu, Ikumatsu, Tetsuko from the Benizakura arc\u2026) This season of Gintama is actually more of a return to the original, before everything got serious. Pure silliness for 13episodes, funny and cringeworthy more often than not, the way it used to be. Good, in a way, but it doesn\u2019t exactly live up to the massive build up from the previous season. Don\u2019t worry though, they\u2019re working on it! They are actually finishing off the final season, but it\u2019s taking a while because, (in the words of Gintama itself) \u2018there were some adult issues at play.\u2019 \ud83d\ude09 (look after the ending credits)\\n\\n\r\nNot the best arc I\u2019ve seen, not even close, but still undeniably Gintama. It has the same cast and crew that we\u2019ve all grown to love by now, and the same style of storytelling that is so ridiculous you almost don\u2019t notice that a bunch of deep messages are thrown in there too. So it\u2019s worth seeing in any case. \ud83d\ude0a XD\\n",

            "content": "Introduction:\r\nGintama... One of the top-rated anime that come out here on this website. At first when I saw Gintama on this website, having 9+/10 ratings on almost every show of it, I persuaded myself to watch all of the seasons even if its really hard due to my schedule. 300+ Episodes? Seriously. I can't even finish Bleach which is also 300+ episodes. So I recklessly tried Gintama from the beginning last summer and I, in fact, one of those who rated every Gintama a 10/10 with one pure reason. Comedy plus Values. Thats how I summarized Gintama. Now this season, the new Gintama came outand it is the \"Slip Arc\".\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nAs stated in the first episode, this arc will present some comedic material throughout the series and after it, will begin the final arc which is the \"Silver Soul\" arc. Now I don't have a problems with this thing because more Gintama meaning more laughter that I really need in my life. If I'm going to review the story of Gintama, then you already know it is hard because... Gintama is meant to be random, though it is full of arcs and side stories. On this season of Gintama, we are presented by \"Slip Arc\", that also have side stories. For example, the story of Nishi Ikumatsu (Katsura's crush who makes ramen for him), who we saw how she was longing to see that one person who was keep on coming to her shack.  Then comes Gin and Kankou (Umibouzou) father issues with the Titans. And also the scabbards' romantic story. Those were funny but there is still some value hidden within it. Like the story of Terakado Tsu (Otsu-chan), who was fallen to the streets again but rose up due to the help of her fans (this was a very funny two episodes). Slip Arc presented us variety of laughable side stories with simple values. Though 13 episodes is really not enough. Lack of executions or content is one of the issue of this arc though it is also an advantage to the author to go ahead with the final arc. What I can describe to it accurately is that this Gintama is like the mini-version of the first season of Gintama. Bite-sized. Let me tell you this. Compare a bite-size Oreo (the mini ones) to the original Oreo cookie. What Oreo have the more milk and chocolate? What Oreo have more taste? Obviously, its the original one although, the bite-size one are made for the ones who are lazy? or who wants to eat it like chips. The \"Porori-hen\" (Slip Arc) offered us what the original Gintama can do although the original have more variety.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nAhh yes.. They are back at it again... First minute of the first episode of this anime showed us already that Gintama is basically the king of all parodies. With the references on top even on the following episodes, its safe to say that all of the characters stick to their attitude and motives since when they appeared in the other seasons. Also, we get to learn more stories about other characters and what can they do like Musashi, Tetsuko (the blacksmith) and Ikumatsu.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nArt is simply Gintama and nothing changed. Though I love how the opening gave us so much colors and when it goes to the chorus, it shows the characters running and the background is full of past scenes from past episodes, which gives a good signifance to it.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe opening gives us hype and thats all we need for every Gintama episode. While the ending gives us like good sets of girls dressed up in bride dress. Not to mention, the soundtrack and other sounds (like when Katsura enters and when someone fails) gives us a Gintama element to it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall thoughts and Enjoyment:\\n\r\nThis Gintama is one of the highest rated anime that was currently aired and yes it deserves to be one of the highest. Enjoyment was top-notch and it is safe to say that this Gintama is like a taste-test (or bite size lol) to the original Gintama. I, honestly, recommend you to watch it before the final arc of Gintama comes so that we will be having smiles before we end Gintama (even though I dont want it to end).",

            "content": "This review of Gintama is about the whole series from 2006-2017 including the Slip Arc. It's my tribute for these years that I spent together with Gintama. Enjoy!\r\nTake a seat and let\u2019s talk about a memorable story.\r\nA story that will not be forgotten , a story that will make laugh and cry , a story that will teach about life and a story that will teach you about what is love and friends and how to value people that are close and dear to you. A story which every addicitive reader should know. \r\nStory 9/10 \r\nHave you ever saw a anime which can combine elementsof comedy and drama and execute it\u2019s concept and idea so well. The story is simple not much to say about it it depicts elements from the history of Japan: Samurai, Katana, Edo-period arhitecture buildings, the old Kyoto capital , Shinsegumi, Shogun, ninja, etc. Since this has parody in the genre elements of parody are added like skyscrapers mixed with old Japanese houses and aliens . This may look dumb and stupid at a first glance but all this elements are explained in the anime during the story and it leaves a strong impact for the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nGintama manages to use so well the parody elements to fulfill it\u2019s purpose of providing amusement to the viewer. Also these parody elements are combined with the drama and action this show has and as a pleasant surprise everything goes well avoiding the clusterfuck and helping with the progress of the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe themes that Gintama covers and abords are vast and the most important ones: family, love,human nature , parody and many more. Gintama doesn\u2019t disappoints us in the slice of life genre at all as a contradiction it manages to execute that theme better than its parody genre.You will learn about family , about love , about sacrifices , about teacher student relation, about friends everything told in a mature perspective to the viewer and with a well directed and balanced tone of comedy and drama.\\n\\n\r\nThe purpose of this anime is simple and it\u2019s executed with no flaws , Gintama makes you laugh as hard as you can and in the next minute it makes you cry and in the end it makes you shout as hard as you can :\u201dWhat a great anime I saw\u201d. Like I mentioned the transition between comedy and drama is flawless because this anime takes time to explain the characters and their background story and every detail is not missed at all. \\n\\n\r\nThe pace in the beginning is slow (first 40) we get used to the characters , habits, actions and interactions , what they like what they hate etc. We are introduced to the crazy setting this story is set and explained step by step about the aliens, skyscrapers , and other residents from that parody edo setting. After that everything comes as a roler coaster and for the pleasant surprise of the viewer this is where Gintama shines the drama and actions scenes well directed. Its strange right a parody being better in the drama and action well Gintama is a balanced show so you won\u2019t notice much of a difference in the transition between comedy drama and action.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of each episode you will learn a lesson about life. Yes each character in this anime tells to the viewer a lesson about life , and leaves a memorable impact on the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10/10\\n\r\nDespite it\u2019s huge number of characters this show manages to develop each character and tell their background story without missing any detail. Even the minor character have their moments to shine in this anime and contribute to the development of other characters. \\n\\n\r\nWhat Gintama manages to exceed many expectations is how it uses these characters to tell the story. Practically the characters in Gintama are the story and each character tells his own story from each of his/her perspective. Gintama connects those stories and bring a meaning to the progression of the story and characters. \\n\\n\r\nGintama doesn\u2019t rushes at all the character development it takes it time for each character at a slow pace adding elements of comedy and drama to the story. At first as any parody the characters are presented as gag characters and used to provide entertainment but oh boy when the pace of the story increases those characters become irreplaceable in Gintama. Let me explain this statement , we get to know their story and circumstances , we are shown how they interact with other characters and how they influence each other directly or indirectly and we see the conclusion told by each character after their experience. \\n\\n\r\nGintama is like a school which teaches his viewers about life and each character from Gintama is a teacher who takes good care of his students and guides them through life.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation 8/10\\n\r\nGood animation, great fighthing scenes , and well directed drama scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nGreat ost and opening songs, the sound is well balanced between the comedy and drama transition.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nYou will laugh until your stomach will hurt, you will cry until you will fill a bucket , you will feel connected to the characters , you will shout \u201cI love this anime\u201d and in the end you will learn a lesson about life called Gintama.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\r\nThis a story that you can tell to your kids and your kids to their kids and so on \u2026\u2026and in the end every generation will come up with the same conclusion :\u201d Thank you for changing my life Gintama\u201d.",

Also, greatest part of Gintamas art is faces of characters and I mean their expressions when something happens. \r\nSound: 10/10\r\nGintama has some soundtracks that are memorable, opening and ending themes are also pretty good. Audio part is great mostly focusing on comedy part of anime, it makes scenes funnier and more memorable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\r\nI have nothing to say here all of them are great and they do everything right. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nGintamas gets better and better and as its 6th season it is one of best seasons. You will enjoy is a much you enjoyed others.\\n\r\nResult: 10/10\\n\r\nFor some people Gintama is best anime ever, I can't agree or disagree with this. Everyone has anime which is best for them for me its Gintama and you will find your one too.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end I will say one thing if you love comedy anime and you watched some of them watch Gintama you won't get disappointed. One really important thing to note is that you have to watch all 5 previous seasons :D.\\n",

            "content": "As an show on its own, this season was decent. However, it somewhat falls short as a gintama season. It is not that this season was bad, but gintama has raised the bar so high that if it is a disappointment if it is anything less than amazing.\r\nI will review it based on the given categories. I apologize if it is too lengthy\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nThe slip arc was going to mainly adapt the old comedy arcs that the anime never adapted. So far, the \"arcs\" - or whatever they're called - have been funny. I found myself laughing to tears at some moments, but I've alsofound myself just nose exhaling (you can look it up on urban dictionary if you don't know what it means) at some other jokes. What weakens the punchlines to this extent is the direction and animation.\\n\r\nGintama always knew how to unveil the punchline of a joke in the perfect manner to enhance it; be it an abrupt punchline, or a creeping one where you laugh before it is even revealed. This new season fails at this at some times, and so did the battle on rakuyo season. I don't know if the director of the show was changed, but the show is lacking in this department.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nSure, gintama isn't famous for its gorgeous art. But when it delivers, it delivers.  I never had any problems with arts or animation in gintama, or at least not until the battle on rakuyo arc. The art and animation have taken a hit after the beautiful FS arc. It is not like everything needs to look on point, that is understandable. So, I do not mind it when characters in the back of a shot look somewhat off-model, but when characters in the front of a shot look off-model, it becomes disengaging. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is okay, albeit it would seem much better if the animation complemented the scenes. The sound effects in general are alright as well, so I have given it a 7 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10 \\n\\n\r\nAll is good. Our beloved cast portrayed as they should be, and the guest supporting cast was interesting. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nIs it enjoyable? yes. An 8 out of 10 if I am being honest to myself.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the season gets an overall of 7/10 once I calculate the average, and it seems  fitting after taking everything into consideration.",

            "content": "The concept of time in the universe of Gintama is by far its most fascinating meta subject. For as much as the show likes to mock itself for its seemingly unchanging sitcom status quo, the fact is that Edo has never been frozen in time. The world has evolved with the show, with new characters, new relationships, old relationships developing and deepening, new playing fields of possibility being opened, and an increasingly changing understanding of the foundation fabric of the story itself., whether in massive game-changing arcs or the nuances of the ever-evolving sitcom antics themselves. Like its central character, Gintama is a show thatis constantly looking forward, constantly running towards the future that waits just beyond its grasp. It\u2019s what\u2019s made it such an exhilarating watch for me, the excitement of wanting to find out just how far this world and my relationship with it would grow and evolve over time. It\u2019s an incredible strength in a show full of incredible strengths.\\n\\n\r\nI bring this up because this is the only time in Gintama\u2019s history where it has, quite literally, decided to stop looking forward and turn back the clock. The Slip Arc is composed of lighter segments and arcs from the manga that were never adapted before, the one-off stories the anime skipped over on its journey to its explosive climax with the Shogun Assassination and Farewell Shinsengumi arcs. Which means that not only are we taking a breather before rushing into what still appears to be the true goddamn finale, we\u2019re taking a breather in the past, in that stretch of easy-going time before Shigeshige's death firmly closed the book on Gintama ever going back to the show it was before. Characters who had died are still around, characters who went through development haven\u2019t had that development yet, and the stakes-raising intensity that followed the Pinky Promise arc is completely absent. This is nostalgic Gintama, complete with the closest thing to a \u201cstandard format\u201d OP we\u2019ve gotten since Day by Day, It\u2019s a trip down memory lane, remembering the fun times we used to share before finally taking on the final boss in the next chamber.\\n\\n\r\nAnd you know what? I\u2019m completely okay with that.\\n\\n\r\nYes, it is, for lack of a more descriptive term, weird to see Umibozu running around still being an over-protective, smothering father after turning over a new leaf following the Battle at Rakuyo. It\u2019s weird to see the Shinsengumi still hanging around, and Sasaki still alive. It\u2019s weird to suddenly be returning focus to the street level we abandoned so long ago, to hang out with characters like Ikamatsu the ramen lady and Hasegawa, the former of whom we haven\u2019t even seen since Katsura first busted up her shop almost 300 episodes ago. But you know what? I liked Hasegawa. I liked Ikamatsu. I liked when I could just stretch my arms and relax with this show, when not every arc needed to be the biggest, most world-ending thing ever. We have had 29 straight episodes of the most awe-inspiring action of the show\u2019s history, the biggest upheavals and reversals and explosions ever. It\u2019s been a LOT. It\u2019s been a lot of good, but it\u2019s been a lot. So if the impetus here is to relax and take a load off, to remember why we fell in love with this show in the first place before bidding it farewell, then I see no reason not to enjoy it for all it's worth.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I say this as someone who has absolutely fucking loved this new era of GIntama; seeing the story enter its final stretch has been so rewarding on so many levels, a masterpiece of payoff that has left me reeling from the impact over and over again. But while Gintama may shine in these big moments, its heart still lies in the small. Yoshiwara in Flames, Battle at Rakuyo, Farewell Shinsengumi, none of these arcs would be as meaningful without the weight of the countess hours we\u2019ve spent just living with these idiots, experiencing life with them in all its stupidity and brilliance. The slowly expansive sitcom formula that defined this show for so long is the soul of Gintama, and it only makes sense to return to it one last time before the grand finale. Whether or not this was planned is an entirely different question all together, but if there\u2019s one thing watching anime for so long has taught me, it\u2019s that something doesn\u2019t need to be planned to matter.\\n\\n\r\nSo yes, I quite enjoyed the Slip Arc and everything it represented. This is Gintama, back in its original form for one last hurrah, full of fun memories and stupid larks and more poop jokes than I know what to do with. This is why I fell in love with you in the first place, show, this wild, uninhibited stream of consciousness, full of humor and heart in equal measure. And I see no reason to complain about that.",

            "content": "This is my second full review on this site. \r\nI want a life for Christmas.\r\nLet me first address the minority among you, the ones actually wanting to know whether Gintama is worth watching - the ones looking for a proper review. Everybody knows the type - every time a season begins or concludes, a few of these pop out of the woodwork looking to \"get into Gintama\" or \"catch up with Gintama\" or whatever. I've had a number of them irl as well.\r\n I understand your confusion. For every 10/10 review claiming Gintama is the best thing since frozen bread, there are probably 5 userswith it being dropped, a score of 1/10, and an incredibly helpful tag of \"overrated\". Every time you decide to take the plunge, a voice in your head asks you - is it truly going to be worth it? In that 300+ episode runtime, you could be doing something useful (or watching other anime, I don't really care) - are you going to invest that time on poop jokes?\\n\\n\r\nTruth is, I can't help you, and I don't think anyone can.\\n\\n\r\nI will say this - when Gintama peaks, it is going to be one of the best anime you've ever seen. It will fully deserve that overblown 9+ score, which ranks it above other hot favorites and makes people salty. It's when it peaks that causes all the polarization, in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nSay you don't like toilet humor. Then for you, the show might peak during its parody bits.\\n\\n\r\nI also know some who consider references to be the lowest form of comedy. Maybe the self-deprecating gags or the ones parodying tropes instead of other media are more your cup of tea.\\n\\n\r\n\"I don't really like anime comedy but I'm checking Gintama out coz of its high score\" - the action arcs might be where the show peaks for you. (Seriously though the score doesn't make it less of a comedy)\\n\\n\r\nThese are only a few examples but the point I'm trying to make is Gintama is mixed bag of  goodies which aren't limited to a single style or genre. The more among them you like, the more you are inclined to like the show as a whole, and vice versa. \\n\r\n Consequently, there is no teaser for Gintama - X episodes you can watch that will tell you exactly what the show is. People might say the show gets good after a certain episode - I think that's more of them finding the first instance where the show peaked for them.  I dare say your experience would be different.\\n\\n\r\nThis isn't to say don't watch Gintama. But barreling through the show expecting 9+ quality right from the start will more often that not turn you away.\\n\r\nOne possible way to watch is to get to know the main cast (~10 episodes) then check out some of the top comedy episodes (there probably are a few threads listing them here and there) - if you like them, great, the show has a definite peak for you, and you can decide to keep watching or not. If you don't, well, 300 episodes is honestly a lot, and most of it is comedy of the same or lower quality.\\n\\n\r\nOnto this season then.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, this season was just regular Gintama. There were good episodes and bad episodes, similar to the previous seasons. Bad episodes, however, seem much more prominent when the season is 13 episodes, compared to 50 or 200. Variances in quality have been present throughout Gintama's run, and I don't necessarily feel this season is weak at least in terms of source material.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest negative for me is the existence of a \"Slip Arc\" when it could have been adapted in order, with perhaps a break before SA began. I also expected the characters to make a lot more fun of the honestly moronic decision to skip stuff.  Whatever. I've made my peace with BNP. Getting a complete adaptation is not something very common, and I suppose I should count my blessings.\\n\\n\r\nThe lack of budget saving background shots still irks me, though. It probably is fucking weird to want fillers, but the self parody segments were one of the biggest positives of Gintama comedy. The humor itself is great, but the love the staff felt for the show really shines through in the bonus segments, like Gintoki getting sleep paralysis for example. I just don't get that from any of the BNP seasons, not just this one. The switch from Sunrise to BNP makes me feel like overseeing an employee who went from giving 110% to 100%. I can't really complain, but I'm still disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nIn any case, whatever my feelings about BNP are, with the multi-colored poop segment of the Excalibur arc I can finally say unironically that I lost brain cells while watching Gintama. I appreciate the fact that they were trying to stick to the manga, which didn't have mosaics. But I can't believe that no one looked at the final product and went, \"hey, this is unbelievably fucking stupid!\" Or they did, and the staff just ran with it anyway. Lampshade stupid things, for god's sake. Make a character say that rainbow poop is shitty, no pun intended. It's moments like these where BNP refuses to utilize the reputation Gintama has built up over the years which make me hate them. Combine this with the ever-present janky zoomed out scenes -  or scenes where the camera focuses on the background instead of the characters - to save budget instead of just airing the fucking static BG, and there's no love lost between me and BNP.\\n\\n\r\nI don't mean for this to turn into another rant - I've accepted that this is the best we're going to get. This season is still weak, but for me it's more due to these small shortcomings that add up instead of the comedy being weaker or stale. I just hope this reduced budget goes to animating the multitude of fights in the SS arc in gloriously high quality. I want Gintama to go out with a bang, not fizzle towards its end.\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr - same Gintama comedy, weaker execution, basically another BNP season 8/10\\n\\n",

You\u2019re probably invested in the characters, not to mention the buildup to the finale that has gradually been revealed through the last two arcs. \r\nThis arc isn\u2019t like that. It\u2019s the slip arc, which actually takes place before the farewell shinsengumi arc, so you can expect to see old faces here. (I\u2019m talking the Shinsengumi, Otsu, Ikumatsu, Tetsuko from the Benizakura arc\u2026) This season of Gintama is actually more of a return to the original, before everything got serious. Pure silliness for 13episodes, funny and cringeworthy more often than not, the way it used to be. Good, in a way, but it doesn\u2019t exactly live up to the massive build up from the previous season. Don\u2019t worry though, they\u2019re working on it! They are actually finishing off the final season, but it\u2019s taking a while because, (in the words of Gintama itself) \u2018there were some adult issues at play.\u2019 \ud83d\ude09 (look after the ending credits)\\n\\n\r\nNot the best arc I\u2019ve seen, not even close, but still undeniably Gintama. It has the same cast and crew that we\u2019ve all grown to love by now, and the same style of storytelling that is so ridiculous you almost don\u2019t notice that a bunch of deep messages are thrown in there too. So it\u2019s worth seeing in any case. \ud83d\ude0a XD\\n",

            "content": "Introduction:\r\nGintama... One of the top-rated anime that come out here on this website. At first when I saw Gintama on this website, having 9+/10 ratings on almost every show of it, I persuaded myself to watch all of the seasons even if its really hard due to my schedule. 300+ Episodes? Seriously. I can't even finish Bleach which is also 300+ episodes. So I recklessly tried Gintama from the beginning last summer and I, in fact, one of those who rated every Gintama a 10/10 with one pure reason. Comedy plus Values. Thats how I summarized Gintama. Now this season, the new Gintama came outand it is the \"Slip Arc\".\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nAs stated in the first episode, this arc will present some comedic material throughout the series and after it, will begin the final arc which is the \"Silver Soul\" arc. Now I don't have a problems with this thing because more Gintama meaning more laughter that I really need in my life. If I'm going to review the story of Gintama, then you already know it is hard because... Gintama is meant to be random, though it is full of arcs and side stories. On this season of Gintama, we are presented by \"Slip Arc\", that also have side stories. For example, the story of Nishi Ikumatsu (Katsura's crush who makes ramen for him), who we saw how she was longing to see that one person who was keep on coming to her shack.  Then comes Gin and Kankou (Umibouzou) father issues with the Titans. And also the scabbards' romantic story. Those were funny but there is still some value hidden within it. Like the story of Terakado Tsu (Otsu-chan), who was fallen to the streets again but rose up due to the help of her fans (this was a very funny two episodes). Slip Arc presented us variety of laughable side stories with simple values. Though 13 episodes is really not enough. Lack of executions or content is one of the issue of this arc though it is also an advantage to the author to go ahead with the final arc. What I can describe to it accurately is that this Gintama is like the mini-version of the first season of Gintama. Bite-sized. Let me tell you this. Compare a bite-size Oreo (the mini ones) to the original Oreo cookie. What Oreo have the more milk and chocolate? What Oreo have more taste? Obviously, its the original one although, the bite-size one are made for the ones who are lazy? or who wants to eat it like chips. The \"Porori-hen\" (Slip Arc) offered us what the original Gintama can do although the original have more variety.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nAhh yes.. They are back at it again... First minute of the first episode of this anime showed us already that Gintama is basically the king of all parodies. With the references on top even on the following episodes, its safe to say that all of the characters stick to their attitude and motives since when they appeared in the other seasons. Also, we get to learn more stories about other characters and what can they do like Musashi, Tetsuko (the blacksmith) and Ikumatsu.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nArt is simply Gintama and nothing changed. Though I love how the opening gave us so much colors and when it goes to the chorus, it shows the characters running and the background is full of past scenes from past episodes, which gives a good signifance to it.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe opening gives us hype and thats all we need for every Gintama episode. While the ending gives us like good sets of girls dressed up in bride dress. Not to mention, the soundtrack and other sounds (like when Katsura enters and when someone fails) gives us a Gintama element to it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall thoughts and Enjoyment:\\n\r\nThis Gintama is one of the highest rated anime that was currently aired and yes it deserves to be one of the highest. Enjoyment was top-notch and it is safe to say that this Gintama is like a taste-test (or bite size lol) to the original Gintama. I, honestly, recommend you to watch it before the final arc of Gintama comes so that we will be having smiles before we end Gintama (even though I dont want it to end).",

            "content": "This review of Gintama is about the whole series from 2006-2017 including the Slip Arc. It's my tribute for these years that I spent together with Gintama. Enjoy!\r\nTake a seat and let\u2019s talk about a memorable story.\r\nA story that will not be forgotten , a story that will make laugh and cry , a story that will teach about life and a story that will teach you about what is love and friends and how to value people that are close and dear to you. A story which every addicitive reader should know. \r\nStory 9/10 \r\nHave you ever saw a anime which can combine elementsof comedy and drama and execute it\u2019s concept and idea so well. The story is simple not much to say about it it depicts elements from the history of Japan: Samurai, Katana, Edo-period arhitecture buildings, the old Kyoto capital , Shinsegumi, Shogun, ninja, etc. Since this has parody in the genre elements of parody are added like skyscrapers mixed with old Japanese houses and aliens . This may look dumb and stupid at a first glance but all this elements are explained in the anime during the story and it leaves a strong impact for the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nGintama manages to use so well the parody elements to fulfill it\u2019s purpose of providing amusement to the viewer. Also these parody elements are combined with the drama and action this show has and as a pleasant surprise everything goes well avoiding the clusterfuck and helping with the progress of the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe themes that Gintama covers and abords are vast and the most important ones: family, love,human nature , parody and many more. Gintama doesn\u2019t disappoints us in the slice of life genre at all as a contradiction it manages to execute that theme better than its parody genre.You will learn about family , about love , about sacrifices , about teacher student relation, about friends everything told in a mature perspective to the viewer and with a well directed and balanced tone of comedy and drama.\\n\\n\r\nThe purpose of this anime is simple and it\u2019s executed with no flaws , Gintama makes you laugh as hard as you can and in the next minute it makes you cry and in the end it makes you shout as hard as you can :\u201dWhat a great anime I saw\u201d. Like I mentioned the transition between comedy and drama is flawless because this anime takes time to explain the characters and their background story and every detail is not missed at all. \\n\\n\r\nThe pace in the beginning is slow (first 40) we get used to the characters , habits, actions and interactions , what they like what they hate etc. We are introduced to the crazy setting this story is set and explained step by step about the aliens, skyscrapers , and other residents from that parody edo setting. After that everything comes as a roler coaster and for the pleasant surprise of the viewer this is where Gintama shines the drama and actions scenes well directed. Its strange right a parody being better in the drama and action well Gintama is a balanced show so you won\u2019t notice much of a difference in the transition between comedy drama and action.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of each episode you will learn a lesson about life. Yes each character in this anime tells to the viewer a lesson about life , and leaves a memorable impact on the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10/10\\n\r\nDespite it\u2019s huge number of characters this show manages to develop each character and tell their background story without missing any detail. Even the minor character have their moments to shine in this anime and contribute to the development of other characters. \\n\\n\r\nWhat Gintama manages to exceed many expectations is how it uses these characters to tell the story. Practically the characters in Gintama are the story and each character tells his own story from each of his/her perspective. Gintama connects those stories and bring a meaning to the progression of the story and characters. \\n\\n\r\nGintama doesn\u2019t rushes at all the character development it takes it time for each character at a slow pace adding elements of comedy and drama to the story. At first as any parody the characters are presented as gag characters and used to provide entertainment but oh boy when the pace of the story increases those characters become irreplaceable in Gintama. Let me explain this statement , we get to know their story and circumstances , we are shown how they interact with other characters and how they influence each other directly or indirectly and we see the conclusion told by each character after their experience. \\n\\n\r\nGintama is like a school which teaches his viewers about life and each character from Gintama is a teacher who takes good care of his students and guides them through life.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation 8/10\\n\r\nGood animation, great fighthing scenes , and well directed drama scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nGreat ost and opening songs, the sound is well balanced between the comedy and drama transition.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nYou will laugh until your stomach will hurt, you will cry until you will fill a bucket , you will feel connected to the characters , you will shout \u201cI love this anime\u201d and in the end you will learn a lesson about life called Gintama.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\r\nThis a story that you can tell to your kids and your kids to their kids and so on \u2026\u2026and in the end every generation will come up with the same conclusion :\u201d Thank you for changing my life Gintama\u201d.",

Also, greatest part of Gintamas art is faces of characters and I mean their expressions when something happens. \r\nSound: 10/10\r\nGintama has some soundtracks that are memorable, opening and ending themes are also pretty good. Audio part is great mostly focusing on comedy part of anime, it makes scenes funnier and more memorable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\r\nI have nothing to say here all of them are great and they do everything right. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nGintamas gets better and better and as its 6th season it is one of best seasons.

Everyone has anime which is best for them for me its Gintama and you will find your one too.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end I will say one thing if you love comedy anime and you watched some of them watch Gintama you won't get disappointed. One really important thing to note is that you have to watch all 5 previous seasons :D.\\n",

            "content": "As an show on its own, this season was decent. However, it somewhat falls short as a gintama season. It is not that this season was bad, but gintama has raised the bar so high that if it is a disappointment if it is anything less than amazing.\r\nI will review it based on the given categories. I apologize if it is too lengthy\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nThe slip arc was going to mainly adapt the old comedy arcs that the anime never adapted. So far, the \"arcs\" - or whatever they're called - have been funny. I found myself laughing to tears at some moments, but I've alsofound myself just nose exhaling (you can look it up on urban dictionary if you don't know what it means) at some other jokes. What weakens the punchlines to this extent is the direction and animation.\\n\r\nGintama always knew how to unveil the punchline of a joke in the perfect manner to enhance it; be it an abrupt punchline, or a creeping one where you laugh before it is even revealed. This new season fails at this at some times, and so did the battle on rakuyo season. I don't know if the director of the show was changed, but the show is lacking in this department.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nSure, gintama isn't famous for its gorgeous art. But when it delivers, it delivers.  I never had any problems with arts or animation in gintama, or at least not until the battle on rakuyo arc. The art and animation have taken a hit after the beautiful FS arc. It is not like everything needs to look on point, that is understandable. So, I do not mind it when characters in the back of a shot look somewhat off-model, but when characters in the front of a shot look off-model, it becomes disengaging. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is okay, albeit it would seem much better if the animation complemented the scenes. The sound effects in general are alright as well, so I have given it a 7 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10 \\n\\n\r\nAll is good. Our beloved cast portrayed as they should be, and the guest supporting cast was interesting. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nIs it enjoyable? yes. An 8 out of 10 if I am being honest to myself.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the season gets an overall of 7/10 once I calculate the average, and it seems  fitting after taking everything into consideration.",

            "content": "The concept of time in the universe of Gintama is by far its most fascinating meta subject. For as much as the show likes to mock itself for its seemingly unchanging sitcom status quo, the fact is that Edo has never been frozen in time. The world has evolved with the show, with new characters, new relationships, old relationships developing and deepening, new playing fields of possibility being opened, and an increasingly changing understanding of the foundation fabric of the story itself., whether in massive game-changing arcs or the nuances of the ever-evolving sitcom antics themselves. Like its central character, Gintama is a show thatis constantly looking forward, constantly running towards the future that waits just beyond its grasp. It\u2019s what\u2019s made it such an exhilarating watch for me, the excitement of wanting to find out just how far this world and my relationship with it would grow and evolve over time. It\u2019s an incredible strength in a show full of incredible strengths.\\n\\n\r\nI bring this up because this is the only time in Gintama\u2019s history where it has, quite literally, decided to stop looking forward and turn back the clock. The Slip Arc is composed of lighter segments and arcs from the manga that were never adapted before, the one-off stories the anime skipped over on its journey to its explosive climax with the Shogun Assassination and Farewell Shinsengumi arcs. Which means that not only are we taking a breather before rushing into what still appears to be the true goddamn finale, we\u2019re taking a breather in the past, in that stretch of easy-going time before Shigeshige's death firmly closed the book on Gintama ever going back to the show it was before. Characters who had died are still around, characters who went through development haven\u2019t had that development yet, and the stakes-raising intensity that followed the Pinky Promise arc is completely absent. This is nostalgic Gintama, complete with the closest thing to a \u201cstandard format\u201d OP we\u2019ve gotten since Day by Day, It\u2019s a trip down memory lane, remembering the fun times we used to share before finally taking on the final boss in the next chamber.\\n\\n\r\nAnd you know what? I\u2019m completely okay with that.\\n\\n\r\nYes, it is, for lack of a more descriptive term, weird to see Umibozu running around still being an over-protective, smothering father after turning over a new leaf following the Battle at Rakuyo. It\u2019s weird to see the Shinsengumi still hanging around, and Sasaki still alive. It\u2019s weird to suddenly be returning focus to the street level we abandoned so long ago, to hang out with characters like Ikamatsu the ramen lady and Hasegawa, the former of whom we haven\u2019t even seen since Katsura first busted up her shop almost 300 episodes ago. But you know what? I liked Hasegawa. I liked Ikamatsu. I liked when I could just stretch my arms and relax with this show, when not every arc needed to be the biggest, most world-ending thing ever. We have had 29 straight episodes of the most awe-inspiring action of the show\u2019s history, the biggest upheavals and reversals and explosions ever. It\u2019s been a LOT. It\u2019s been a lot of good, but it\u2019s been a lot. So if the impetus here is to relax and take a load off, to remember why we fell in love with this show in the first place before bidding it farewell, then I see no reason not to enjoy it for all it's worth.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I say this as someone who has absolutely fucking loved this new era of GIntama; seeing the story enter its final stretch has been so rewarding on so many levels, a masterpiece of payoff that has left me reeling from the impact over and over again. But while Gintama may shine in these big moments, its heart still lies in the small. Yoshiwara in Flames, Battle at Rakuyo, Farewell Shinsengumi, none of these arcs would be as meaningful without the weight of the countess hours we\u2019ve spent just living with these idiots, experiencing life with them in all its stupidity and brilliance. The slowly expansive sitcom formula that defined this show for so long is the soul of Gintama, and it only makes sense to return to it one last time before the grand finale. Whether or not this was planned is an entirely different question all together, but if there\u2019s one thing watching anime for so long has taught me, it\u2019s that something doesn\u2019t need to be planned to matter.\\n\\n\r\nSo yes, I quite enjoyed the Slip Arc and everything it represented. This is Gintama, back in its original form for one last hurrah, full of fun memories and stupid larks and more poop jokes than I know what to do with. This is why I fell in love with you in the first place, show, this wild, uninhibited stream of consciousness, full of humor and heart in equal measure. And I see no reason to complain about that.",

Admittedly, I was slightly surprised about the way this season just presented itself as a silly interlude right from the get go. At the time I was unsure if it would work putting the main story on hold, however, I was pleasantly satisfied after watching.\r\nI must say that it ever so slightly missed the bar that Gintamaset itself, just by a smidgen. Although it pulls off what it needed to rather well.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 9\\n\\n\r\nLacking slightly compared to previous seasons. Seems arcs are a little forced together.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10\\n\\n\r\nGintama art has improved tenfold over the years and is at a near-perfect state.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting brilliant as always. Soundtracks compliment the art well.\\n\r\nOP is one of my of my favourite from the series, ED lacking slightly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10\\n\\n\r\nWhat do you expect? It's Gintama!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment Overall - 10\\n\\n\r\nWatch this show right from the beginning, NOW!",
