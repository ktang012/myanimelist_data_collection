            "content": "Gate could've been a story of modern vs old, with a bit of cultural exchange; instead it went down the otaku pandering route, combined with absurd amounts of right-wing nationalism.\r\nIt is a real shame, since there were some genuinely interesting comparisons, such as the difference of how prisoners are treated by the Japanese army compared to the medieval army, but these scenes are barely touched upon, as if the writer was only using the scenes to say \"Japan is the good guy! Everyone else is the bad guy!\"\r\nIn fact, that seems to be the running theme throughout the series. Japan is presented as the GoodTeam 100% of the way. Everything the JSDF does is unanimously praised, while the Americans, the Chinese, the opposing medieval armies, and even the Japanese DIET that oppose the invasion are portrayed as being evil, greedy, or just plain imbecilic. As the show continued, it became more and more like Japanese military propaganda rather than a legitimate story. Any and all enemies are helplessly mowed down by the superior might of the Japanese Army and the immortal death god (who looks like a thirteen year old girl) that joins them. This doesn't exactly lead to tense battles, since it's quite obvious who's going to win every time, and the show doesn't even try to hide it.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters? Well, there is the protagonist, Itami, who is an otaku (who also happens to be a top-class soldier with a heart of gold), his squad, and a bunch of underage multi-color haired girls (except they're elves and demigods, so they're actually hundreds of years old!). None of these characters undergo any sort of development, and their personalities are practically non-existent. They exist to be cute girls, and that is it. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, it was somewhat fun to watch the cultural exchanges that took place, and I cannot say in good conscience that I didn't enjoy myself. But I feel that Gate could've been a lot more than mindless entertainment, so I can't help but be disappointed.",

            "content": "A gate to a medieval fantasy land opens up in Japan, and this can only mean one thing: sword-wielding troops get mowed down by the glorious Japanese military in their attack copters with Wagner playing. And I mean that in-universe; the soldiers are literally playing a CD of Wagner in their copters.\r\nWhy, you ask? Because Japan needs more technology and minerals and such because nationalism says so. Oh, and some humanitarian reasons, but those aren't as important. \r\nThe plot kicks off when out of nowhere a gate appears and from it come a bunch of orcs and medieval troops that indiscriminately kill civilians, wreck theplace and interrupt the otaku event the protagonist was planning to visit. As so it happens, the protagonist is not only an otaku but also a member of the SDF (Japanese military), and once the initial attack has been dealt with, he joins the force sent through the gate. \\n\\n\r\nThis fantasy land is declared a part of Japan, named the Special Region, because why not? (Nice name, by the way; that's what I'd call a fantasy land too if I ever occupied one.) The Japanese constitution forbids (at the moment, anyway) deploying the SDF abroad, but I guess that's one way around it: just annex territory arbitrarily and suddenly it's all Japanese soil. Some fighting ensues, but no worries: their enemies are so outgunned they might as well be throwing rocks at them. Aside from the technology gap, these feudal lords also come from the Zapp Brannigan school of tactics with plans like:\\n\r\n1. Suicidal charge,\\n\r\n2. Suicidal charge, and\\n\r\n3. Suicidal charge under the cover of night (worth a shot, I guess?)\\n\\n\r\nActually, that was kind of the idea behind the original invasion into Japan: go to an unknown land without any intel or recon and slaughter everything for fun and profit. ...Yeah.\\n\\n\r\nSoon enough our merry band can venture further into this land while talking about their waifus and singing magical girl theme songs, eager to meet the local catgirls. In the process they recruit mages, elves and goth lolis. The writers thought the SDF wasn't overpowered enough, so the goth loli happens to be an invincible demigod priestess who effortlessly crushes everything in her path. The tone of the show is what you might expect, with slaughter and fanservice taking turns. What is a hot bath scene without people's arms flying off afterwards?\\n\\n\r\nThere is also a cultural clash going on, which is used for dialogue like:\\n\r\n\"I had no idea our world had [insert everyday thing here].\"\\n\r\n\"Princess, this is another world!\"\\n\r\n\"Oh, right!\"\\n\r\nRepeat it a few times and you have comedy gold.\\n\\n\r\nSome of the cultural misunderstandings actually make sense, such as the different interests of a feudal society and a modern country, the treatment of prisoners or the idea of throwing a half-naked woman at the protagonist to earn his favor. Actually, the last one just might have worked if he hadn't been distracted by all the animal girl maids already. And who can blame him for being distracted? Barely dressed girls keep throwing themselves at him out of coincidence or because he's just that awesome.\\n\\n\r\nIf it isn't obvious by now, the operation beyond the Gate is a one-country effort. Sharing resources with others? Don't be ridiculous. The US, Russia and China (the rest of the world doesn't exist) don't deserve their slice of the cake. Especially America. \"A sky with no civilian or US planes in it is a dream come true\" for Japanese fighters.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, this is all run by the SDF. Civilian personnel? Media presence? Dream on. All we need is the SDF. Who else would defend Japanese interests? The Japanese government is corrupt and easily swayed. The parliament is a bunch of idiots who want to mess with the SDF's business for no reason. How dare they ask questions about civilian casualties under a media blackout? Eventually there is an entire town for the locals, with shops and everything. Would now be a time to bring in civilians? No, that could get in the way of the runaway militarism we have going on. To maintain order, some of the locals are actually given armbands with \"Military Police\" on them. \\n\\n\r\nThe visuals include machine guns, missiles, tanks, artillery, copters and fighters, which is nice. Sadly most of the soundtrack is not Wagner, which is a shame because that would be poetic justice.\\n\\n\r\nBy the way, it is never explained how the Gate was built. Did the Empire build it (which I kind of doubt) or just find it? Are there more of them? If you are after fantasy tech, shouldn't this be near the top of your list? Think about it: you could discover a Stargate network and explore even more worlds for even more glorious nationalism! But nope, never mentioned.\\n\\n\r\nNow let's all take a moment and salute the Japanese flag flying in the distance.",

            "content": "Two worlds, different dimensions, one is fantasy and the other one are reality. If these two existences merge with one gate, what will the future hold for both worlds? \r\nGate: jieitai kanochi nite kaku tatakaeri or also known as Gate start the show with a bit unique performance and leave the viewers speechless while trying to grasp the situation. I'll admit, on the surface this series doesn't sound like it would make a good series. Add more with the main lead Youji Itami who\u2019s already aged 33 years old. One of the most courageous steps I\u2019ve ever seen. Anime industries have laid teenagers as themain character for a long time. Gate on the other hand; put a matured and adult man as their main lead which is rather impressive. Unfortunately, our hero is kind of biased with the other main characters who have loved anime and manga deeply. However, I must commend this series because the producers have been doing a good job to develop those characters in series well along with communicating on a larger theme about humanity in general.\\n\\n\r\nGate: jieitai kanochi nite kaku tatakaeri will be one of the most popular anime soon enough and definitely for a good reason. The series start its pace rather slow at first but very effective, and refreshing for the better understanding. \\n\\n\r\nThe technical aspects of the show are really good. Though Gate never loses its character focus, the idea of spending a lot of time exploring political, economics, philosophical and a wide variety of subjects about the fantasy world can be very boring but important for us to understand the motivations of certain characters. As well it is necessary to understand the series better. In terms, the series try it\u2019s best to describe the best path for humanity against this fictional world. It has its merits and its flaws, but above all it is not simple. This issue is rather complex to be discussing or used in anime series and yet Gate does a nicely job showing the themes. \\n\\n\r\nDespite what I\u2019ve said, the realistic way the Gate tries to show sometime can be frustrating with lack of the deeper themes. The plot is actually quite smart but also a little complex than it seem. Still, the developments in the series just makes you want to dive deeper and deeper into the series. The interaction between all the characters is well managed as for the feel of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation of this series is very nice indeed. Gate background has been designed with the best effort, vivid colors and lines to stylize the characters in a way. The art has been nicely drawn with a lit bit of different style to makes more realistic. Either way, both the art and animation is incredible created for the Gate series. The high-end action is carefully placed and definitely top notch. The value of background is clearly be valued by Gate series.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is really cool, with the outstanding Op and Eds, capturing the viewer\u2019s eye within the series. This is really stunning aspects. Not to mention the sound effects, adding with the previous two, this takes the series to a new stage of fantastic and admiration. \\n\\n\r\nIn a sense, Gate is one of the best shows I've seen in a while. I\u2019m not particular boasting about this series. Because Gate is an excellent and enraging works that\u2019s doesn\u2019t lose the main theme focus, the characters never lost their main aim and building up a good relationship among each others. While on the other hand, Gate also focusing a number of high class issues and problems that chained this world for a long time. Gate is definitely a brilliant piece of surreal fantasy fiction that works on nearly every level. If you against the idea of political or philosophical exploration just skip those episodes but it will be a great loss and definitely will affecting your view of the series. Honestly, I can't complain about this series at all. On a purely level, this piece of series was impressive. \\n",

            "content": "GATE, a simple 4 letter word that can release so much potential with its premise. The idea behind GATE is that of a series about modernized humans clashing with fantasy (warriors wielding ancient armor, elves, dwarves, dragons, etc). By clashing, it doesn\u2019t entirely mean a total war between the two sides. After a while, both sides begins to establish a diplomatic relationship with one another. Sounds strange right? It also kind of goes in a two-fold. Fantasy enters reality and reality enters fantasy. Both worlds are separated by a gate and at the center of it, there\u2019s a man named Youji Itami. \r\nGate - JieitaiKare no Chi nite Kaku Tatakaeri (Gate - Thus the JSDF Fought There) or simply known as GATE is a television series that adapts the light novel of the same name. It was originally serialized online on a novel website called \u201cArcadia\u201d but later got published as a book in 2010. The series also has a manga that is based on the story with the same main characters. Speaking of which, Itami is the main male protagonist of the show and it\u2019s easy for us to get familiarized with him. Despite being a soldier, he\u2019s actually quite more like an otaku with his fascination for fantasy. This lands him in a position where he happily investigates the fantasy world beyond the GATE. Little does he know that is more than what he can bite off.\\n\\n\r\nThe show itself adapts many elements that blurs between lines of fiction and reality. The fiction part obviously comes with the fantasy creatures like elves, dragons, and even a demi-god. JSDF (Japan Self-Defense Forces) has more of the reality role. Their military is equipped with high level technology and hence were able to fight against the fantasy world in the beginning. There was even an infamous event known as the \u201cGinza Incident\u201d when monsters appeared in the Ginza, a real world location and made a memorable massacre. Of course, JSDF responded fiercely and showed that humanity is a doorknob to absolutely nobody. By establishing such a premise, it\u2019s no wonder that the show has a lot of potential. Think about it really, when you have a war that is more than just about imperialism, it shows how much it can evolve. Throughout the story of GATE, we see much of that with cultural, political, and military themes.\\n\\n\r\nGATE\u2019s characters are highly diverse not just because of personalities but by races. No, I\u2019m not just talking about nationalities but also non-humans. The main core consists of three girls \u2013 Tuka Luna Mareau (a 165 year old elf), Lelei La Rellena (a 15 year old human from the fantasy world), and Rory Mercury (a demi-goddess who is apparently over 900 years old). These characters have different personalities but also creates fascination as they enter the real world. What we witness throughout the story is how they adapt with real world concepts such as modern life technology and politics. Additionally, a plus side about the show is that the human characters are fairly mature. Itami is an older male (as opposed to the high school teenagers you\u2019d commonly see these days) and has a strong interest in otaku. His military experience also gives him an edge when negotiating with certain parties and we see a lot of what he is capable of throughout the story. His relationship with co-workers from the Third Recon unit also gives us a firm idea of his personality \u2013 a casual guy who is kind at heart and easily able to make friends with others. \\n\\n\r\nFrom the fantasy world, there are also other regions that establishes the clever creativity of this how. For instance, there\u2019s the special region that is composed of an empire with a diverse cast of characters. Pina, the princess of that empire, hopes to establish peace with Japan. There are obvious reasons for this but the show also affirms her personality as a proud princess who is caring towards her people. Furthermore, the show has a strong emphasis of its world fiction. Landscapes and towns are built with resourceful elements of fantasy to make the other world look legitimate. Similarly, there\u2019s a creatures that show their menacing presence while establishing dominance in their world.\\n\\n\r\nAn interesting idea about the show also comes from the political affairs of the story. In the second half of GATE, we get politics as there\u2019s some strong indication that not everyone is in favor of the \u201cspecial region\u201d idea. So in essence, the show plays its part with conflicting affairs that argues about political principles. The show also has some sense of nationalism although is vaguely portrayed and restrained to Japan, as other countries are pursuing their own interest. To say the least, GATE knows its principles and invests time to show ideologies from various parties.\\n\\n\r\nOn a more military aspect, I think the show is also aware of its modern technological capabilities. The military reveals a strong degree of realism with its arsenal of weapons throughout the show. We have aircraft such as the Kawasaki OH-1, AH-1 Cobra, and other artillery that makes its presence well known. Soldiers (known to some in the fantasy world as \u201cGreen Men\u201d) also demonstrate their degree of professionalism and ethnics. While the series isn\u2019t entirely built about military, it certainly has an appeal to this side. I will also say that GATE\u2019s author did a fairly decent job at demonstrating the firepower and capabilities of the JSDF\u2019s military. The battles have cinematic sequences and is well animated on most parts especially during mid-season.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the show has lighthearted comedy from all sorts of angles, it also should be realized that its intentions isn\u2019t a parody. Sure, the series makes a bit of fun at otaku culture such as Itami\u2019s knowledge or the character designs of the main girls. However, there\u2019s legitimacy with the war. The first episode easily establishes that JSDF is serious about their counterattack. Furthermore, Itami knows the stakes of war as lives are lost. Unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t capture all the violence and more mature content of the original story. Certain contents are omitted from TV that are deemed controversial and violent. Fan service is also shortened although still exists in a few forms such as with Rory\u2019s teasing and the bath scenes. However, the adaptation does expand on certain parts of the story, especially with events from the manga. \\n\\n\r\nImpressively, A-1 Pictures actually manages to capture the art style of the story. Their work can be a bit of hit or miss in terms of fantasy shows but I do give them some praise for adapting GATE. The character designs of characters from both the real world and fantasy world evokes interest. Military technology looks and feels real with their modern looks. Japan also has a good degree of realism with its modern cities and technology. From the fantasy world, the main female characters are distinctive with their design ranging from Rory\u2019s goth dress to Pina\u2019s medieval style battle gear. And like I mentioned before, the world fiction of GATE stands out as a fantastic feature with what is shown. To further enhance the experience, we get epic battles that almost always reveal the potential of certain characters and weapons. \\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is powerful but not the type of mind-blowing you may expect. The OP and ED theme song has a catchy tone to it with a modest style of storytelling. What makes GATE perhaps more noticeable is the dialogues that are spoken with sharp tones. And by sharp, I mean the type that clearly defines what kind of characters\u2019 personalities are capable of. Rory\u2019s sarcastic and curious voice is perhaps one of the most noticeable while Pina\u2019s voice shows a sense of her patriotism. On most parts, the OST works well enough to match the intense atmosphere of the action and lighthearted moments. \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes down to it, GATE is a show that opens a gate with wealth of interests. There\u2019s the certain \u201cit\u201d factor that makes this show stand out with both sides of the world. It blurs between the lines of fiction and reality with what it has to offer. And to be quite honest, GATE does it quite well on most parts with its creativity. This show is definitely not one that matches anyone\u2019s tastes though. Certain audiences such as those interested in political or military affairs may find this more enjoyable than others. For action junkies, GATE can appeal to that side as well although it\u2019s not a main investment of the story. When it comes to characters, there\u2019s a colorful range of them and by the end of the season, there\u2019s likely one or more that you may like to find out more. The first season is set as 12 episodes but many of the ideas and concepts opens up potentially for more.",

            "content": "GATE is a story about the pursuit of peace, a brave tale about setting our differences aside and to work for the common good. That common good is the Japanese military and cute girls, which are the greatest pillars of holiness that humanity has to offer. By pitting modern day Japan against a medieval fantasy-setting, GATE manages to contrast two incredibly different worlds with each other, showing how peace can be achieved by ignoring all complex questions. Just relax, turn off your brain, and worship the power of cute girls.\r\nSPOILERS\r\nLet\u2019s compare how religion works in the two worlds. The god(s) that we know are usuallysilent, leaving us with highly complex spiritual lives, inner lives that require us to think about our morals and to question our faith at times. In the fantasy world we have a goth-lolita, a demigod who is immortal and blessed with regeneration that won\u2019t allow her to die. Worshipping war and darkness has given her literal super-powers. If our gods took such physical manifestations, how would our society look today? If these demigods came to our world and saw how our religions impact our lives, how would they react? All of these questions are skillfully evaded by the fact that the goth-lolita is very old yet looks like a child, making her excellent fap-material devoid of any deeper meaning.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s also examine how GATE teaches us to deal with culture-shocks, and how to deal with such a multifaceted subject. Our main character is an otaku, which usually carries a bit of a social stigma. Otakus can however also be considered nerds, people who love to immerse themselves in certain subjects, be it science, history, or fiction. No doubt an otaku who loves fantasy would be ideal to send to a fantasy-world. Their genuine interest in the land\u2019s complex history and customs would be valuable for the sake of embracing our differences. The protagonist however quickly finds his true calling, in the form of a big cast of beautiful girls that he must protect. Truly, when it comes to appreciating other cultures and countries, what else is more important than looking at how beautiful the women are?\\n\\n\r\nNever fear, the other side also encounters culture shocks. A female knight visits Japan, and we learn that she wishes to completely embrace Japanese culture. You might wonder what made it possible for a medieval knight to love our world so much, and the answer is yaoi. When she sees some gay porn, she realizes what true art is. In fact, when she has to go to an ordinary library and see classic Greek sculptures and pieces of our history, she comes back exhausted and bored with life. This illustrates that learning about history and different customs is not the true path to understanding, all we ever needed to find true peace was porn. GATE is in many ways ahead of its time, showing how someone from a medieval European-inspired culture can immediately accept yaoi manga. By never even mentioning how homosexuality is looked upon in her world, we also see how insignificant discussions about sexuality is in this show about contrasting worlds.\\n\\n\r\nThe most masterful moment of avoiding conflict is when several of the otherworldly cute girls are about to exit Japan. The story reminds the viewer of the memorial dedicated to everyone who died during the first attack when the portal was opened. Naturally, since the ambassadors of the people that slaughtered so many are cute girls, everyone just cheers for them. Why would anyone be upset over the death of their loved ones? Clearly terrorist-organizations of today could have gained fan-clubs if they simply were more attractive.\\n\\n\r\nIn all honesty though, GATE is a harmless show with good animation and sound, but it\u2019s also a series that gets more irritating the more one actually thinks back on it. It likes to meander, stopping to pander to the otakus and prolong things with needless misunderstandings, which is most apparent in the last two episodes when there\u2019s a dragon just around the corner, yet nothing is done to get to the point. If one can see past the tired tropes and slow pacing in the latter half, this show can count as mindless entertainment. A second season is coming, and I can only hope it improves.",

            "content": "The show opens with some loser otaku in his twenties named Itami doing his loser otaku things before a mysterious portal opens in the middle of the city, causing a bunch of fantasy soldiers to enter the real world and slaughter everyone in sight because they\u2019re dirty racist foreigners who hate Japanese despite having just met them or something. No really, that\u2019s it. We never get an explanation for why this portal even exists, let alone why these soldiers have a beef with Japan other than \u201cbecause there\u2019d be no story otherwise\u201d. Also because they wanted to show that nerdy losers can kick ass too,because it turns out that said loser otaku is actually in the military - and I never got the backlash for this by the way because we have a fujoshi in the military running a fairly popular anime blog right now, so it\u2019s not that much of a stretch.\\n\\n\r\nAfter that admittedly exciting conflict, the show proceeds to dump a whole lot of boring plot on us by deciding the best response to this act of aggression is for Japan to send their own military into the portal and weed out the foreigners before they come back to weed-whack them. And any sympathy you may feel for the country due to the \u201cinnocent slaughtering\u201d in the show\u2019s opening act will quickly dissolve when every character seems to forget about the first act long before the audience does. In fact, Itami forgot about it as soon as it was over. No, I\u2019m not exaggerating here. After all the killing that happened in front of him, he just thought about the anime event he was supposed to attend rather than helping civilians in the aftermath. You literally could have just had the otherworldly portal appear out of nowhere, send the military in for no good reason other than \u201chuman curiosity\u201d, and it would have made no difference to the story. For a fictional product centered on soldiers, death is really cheap in Gate.\\n\\n\r\nAnd by god does it get even cheaper as it goes on, with a good helping of one-sidedness to go along with it. Most of the battles that happen in this anime have very little purpose other than to show how outclassed magic and dragons are compared to machine guns and tanks, and whenever a powerful fantasy creature who can go toe-to-toe with the military does show up, they\u2019re always on the protagonists\u2019 side so there\u2019s no tension to follow our heroes. Itami\u2019s group literally gains three fan-pandering fantasy \u201canime\u201d girls within the span of a single episode, and one of them is a demi-god who is immortal, far superior in terms of fighting prowess to everyone else to the point that she resembles a cheat code, and joins because the plot says so - along with the fact that it wouldn\u2019t be a light novel adaptation if we didn\u2019t have physically fit females falling in love with clueless male leads. They didn\u2019t even try to explain anything regarding why she finds him or helping the Japanese interesting. It\u2019s just a masturbatory power fantasy that gets in the way of the plausibility and the excitement of the scenario.\\n\\n\r\nAnd this may just be me, but am I the only one who thinks \"Japanese Adam Sandler\" whenver Itami is on-screen? I know most light novel anime feel like they were produced by Happy Madison, but Itami in particular really comes off to me like someone who'd be played by Sandler in the live-action Hollywood adaptation. The show just can't seem to decide whether or not they want to portray him as a bumbling loser or a heroic badass, so one minute he's a highly trained advanced special forces guy who's undergone rigorous training and the next minute he's getting pussy-whipped by princesses who always assume the worst. This unlikely scenario is brought to attention by some of the characters, but the show never gives a good reason for it, and he's not even put in situations where his special training would be of any use, so he might as well not have it.\\n\\n\r\nLiterally, the only reason he's the focus character is because the show needed a male protagonist to suck dick on since it'd have no idea how to progress anything otherwise. Gate has the usual light novel problem of going from act to act without much of a clear end goal in mind, and thus the only way to proceed is to put our leads in situations where they make things happen without undergoing any personal arcs of their own in the process. A small town is raided by bandits for the sole purpose of having the military show off their superior strength without suffering any losses on their side. Soldiers from other countries are massacred by the demi-god girl just to show how deus ex she is whilst also carrying the usual anti-American themes we've come to expect from most anime that involve government in one way or another. There's this court debate involving the elf girl that I can't be bothered to describe. And assuming you can get past the Japanese nationalism in all those scenarios, most of the credit for everything good always seems to go to Itami and no one else, even though all he did was get important women to fall for his charms.\\n\\n\r\nAre you seriously telling me that no other military unit accomplished anything significant in some other part of this world, let alone did more than this dude? No one else bothered to learn the fantasy peoples' language at all? I mean Japan eventually claims part of the other world as its own territory and instills its own customs on the local residents with no backlash whatsoever unless you count the occasional bandit, and yet only Itami can help out when a woman seeks \"the green people\" in order to hunt down a dragon? At least put him in scenarios where he actually has to work for his respect if you're going to go that far in rewarding him.\\n\\n\r\nBut of course, whilst I could go on and on regarding these issues, the truth of the matter is that Gate's scenario writing is so fatally flawed that you could have made James Bond the main character and it wouldn't have upped the quality to any significant degree. Its \"evil\" end goals regarding the Japanese military and the obnoxious fan-wanking are just supplementary reasons to hate it compared to how unimportant and phoned-in everything plays out due to a lack of a convincing reason to care for the conflict, along with a lack of a compelling antagonistic force. If anything, they at least add flavor to pay attention to, even if it's for the wrong reasons. I mean what's left if you strip that all away? A really bland product with no clear sense of progression, no clear end goal, no tension, and ridiculous-looking animation that isn't very exciting to the eye.\\n\\n\r\nEven its fucking sequel hook is just to setup a random adventure that has virtually no bearing on the conflict between modern and magic. I guess I can credit it for being honest with the audience that there's nothing to look forward to come next Winter, but why don't you go the extra mile, A-1, and put up a disclaimer whilst you're at it?",

            "content": "This is one of the worst anime I've ever seen. \r\n(And I've seen a lot)\r\nIf this was some cheap production, with recycled scenes, it'd be easy to see why it's bad. After all, \"look! They reused the same animation for the umpteenth time!\"\r\nBut that's not why GATE is bad. Gate is bad because of really, really terrible story. The plot is horrible and the characters worse. \r\nThe plot is essentially: A stargate like portal to another world opens in downtown Tokyo. A hoard of a marauding medieval army and monsters comes out and starts attacking civilians. \r\nBut! The Japanese Self Defense Force steps in tosave the day! Then they launch an invasion of the other side of the gate, and set up a full military base there, and begin to basically occupy and slaughter hundreds of thousands of iron age level people. \\n\\n\r\nWhat makes this horrible is is not just that GATE is a completely one-sided massacre. It's that the JSDF is celebrated as these great people with wonderful personalities who switch effortlessly between mass killing and affable, likeable people at a moment's notice. \\n\\n\r\nThen, to top it all off, their invasion is shown to be celebrated by some of the local people. \\n\\n\r\nThe whole thing feels profane. There's one scene where you are shown in this pristine, undisturbed ecosystem that fighter jets have been brought into this other world, and while people are riding around on horseback, the JSDF is flying practice maneuvers overhead. \\n\\n\r\nThere's even a scene in one episode where they mimic the \"Ride of the Valkyries\" scene from Apocalypse Now, complete with music blaring from the helicopters as the JSDF essentially murders masses of people with the sheer one-sided slaughter, just mowing them down. \\n\\n\r\nThe entire anime, is essentially unabashed Japanese military propaganda. \\n\r\nBut whereas most military propaganda, likes to portray troops as hero's and rescuers, this show portrays the JSDF as unabashed mass murderers who are perfectly okay, and completely unfazed with mass one-sided slaughter. \\n\\n\r\nIt's like watching an army recruitment commercial, only one that after showing the troops spilling out of the landing craft, with patriotic music, then shows them lining up 2000 people and executing them on site, and then afterwards laughing and smiling, while the patriotic music still plays. \\n\\n\r\nIt's sickening. And completely absurd. And the characters are just as shallow. They have no morals, feel no sense of wrong about what they are doing, just continue to follow orders and act like what they are doing is a-ok. \\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't be surprised if the production itself was backed by money from the JSDF. It's pretty unabashed propaganda. \\n\\n\r\nBut what makes this really horrible to watch, is how unashamed they are at the horrible things they are doing, and how it's portrayed as completely normal with no sense of irony. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound design is pretty poor, the characters are poor, the plot is terrible. The animation? It's not bad, but most of it is simply showing off guns and military vehicles so is essentially gun otaku porn. \\n\\n\r\nI kept watching, hoping it might get better, and that the glorification of one-sided mass killing was really supposed to be flipped around at some point and show the JSDF as the bad guys they really are in this anime. Nope. It just keeps acting like they are the good guys, in the most absurd way. \\n\\n\r\nVery creepy, and extremely unintelligent, shallow, and hollow show with one-sided characters, and very obviously being Japanese Military propaganda.\\n\\n\r\n\"Look! We don't just slaughter people, we laugh and have a beer afterwards too!\"\\n\\n",

            "content": "This show has so much potential, so while I did enjoy it (perhaps simply because there are not much similarly-themed anime to compare with) don't expect too much from this harem comedy anime. Quick review below:\r\nSTORY = 6/10\r\nWhile having so much to offer, sadly GATE resorts to generic comedy harem theme every time it hints serious development to the main plot. I mean, we rarely have a chance to explore a situation where modern world clashes with fantasy world, and everytime I expect a progress after those \"serious scene\", all i get are filler-like episodes that took main plot almost nowhere. By the time Ifinished this series, I still have no idea WHY the empire attacks Japan (an otherworld they know nothing about), HOW they build the dimensional GATE - IF they build it at all.\\n\\n\r\n+ Genuine, refreshing idea\\n\r\n- Wasted its potential despite serious atmosphere hinted in early episodes\\n\r\n- Some plotholes and illogical actions taken by the power players that I cannot discuss without spoilers\\n\\n\r\nART = 6/10\\n\\n\r\n+ Main points goes to detailed render of war vehicles & weapons\\n\r\n- Char and background are so-so, and it's pretty weird if you notice how the male and female eyes are in very different style, i mean i can understand if it was used intentionally to highlight the difference of real and fantasy world, but that is obviously not the case.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND = 7/10\\n\\n\r\nSimilar to art, main points goes to detailed modern warfare sounds : engines, gunshots, etc. OP is pretty generic and ED is less than mediocre. Not that it matters much. Seiyuus did their job perfectly for characters they represent, but then again this is a standard we should expect from today's anime , so.. what else can i say?\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER = 4/10\\n\\n\r\nMain screen time are spent on these main protagonists: Itami, Rory, Lelei, Pina Co Lada (in order of appearance), each represents a stereotypical harem casts in a slightly diferrent, original seting. It means they base their actions on harem logic. WISH I KNEW IT FROM THE START. That way i can prepare my mind by setting my expectation as low as possible.\\n\\n\r\nWait, what is harem logic? Let me illustrate by a few samples without spoiling it too much :\\n\\n\r\n- Instead of asking the enemy \"why did you attack us\", or asking ANYONE that might have the answers.. you hang around with her and her harem army to get into harem situations as much as you could.\\n\\n\r\n- Almost every main girls the main protagonist met succumb to his \"charm\" , by default or nice coincidence, whichever is more convenient. Also, the story at some point completely disregards plot logic and progress it has built.. to get main protagonist into harem situations. Again.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the other side characters.. they don't have much screen time. Even if a few of them have any, it's because they happened to be together with those main casts I mentioned above - and are used as \"dolls\" to complement whatever Itami's doing.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT 6 / 10\\n\\n\r\nReflecting on how GATE treats the gate as a tool to build a comedy harem situations around it, instead of exploring its full potential and develop realistic / serious plot using up-to-date \"modern warfare\" know-how (yes it was being hinted in a few conversations, but they never develop it), I hereby judge GATE as \"guilty pleasure\" anime of this year\\n\\n\r\n.. the pleasure mainly comes from a few action worthy moments & serious/ logical conversations in the first 2 episodes, which steadily drop as the series progress. I give it a 6 anyway, considering that some people may still enjoy it by adjusting their expectation or just because they like comedy harem theme.",

            "content": "Gate is propaganda, and based on how high it scores here it's damn effective but as an anime series it fails on the most basic of principles and just isn't any good once you realize it was built solely around being pro-military media fodder.\r\nSo let's break this down into the grading criteria itself: \r\nStory: 3/10 \r\nGate's surprisingly strong opening and base concept is the only reason I didn't rate it any lower as in the right hands they could have been the building blocks for a genuinely good show.  \r\nShortly after the JSDF enters the titular gate things take a turn for the worseand the originally unique and interesting concept of an otaku turned local hero being forced to serve his country in a high fantasy setting who's ruling country had previously attacked Japan turns into generic otaku harem fodder all to sell a 100% pro-militaristic, pro-Japanese message. \\n\\n\r\nEven barring how annoyingly obvious the propaganda is it's a failing in story telling as our main characters stumble through situations that are generally resolved one of two ways:\\n\\n\r\n1. Japan/Pro Japanese characters win because they are 100% good and right all the time (See: Propaganda) \\n\\n\r\n2. The even more annoying: Time skips that show none of the resolution and we are told through literal dialogue breaking the most fundamental of writing rules: Show don't tell. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot get's weak quickly, though attempting to add a level of court intrigue and political drama it is mired down in it's inability to make the issues subtle or nuanced as it paints literally every other country, either fictional or real, as bad guys to the bone. Even going so far as casting the US as a country intent on kidnapping members of the main cast for no reason beyond it makes Japan look better by comparison. \\n\\n\r\nMost the world mechanics inside the gate are glossed over or never addressed, there is literally no world building. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe best part of this show by a landslide Gate is undeniably pleasing to look at, the style breaks slightly from the current popular style with the people beyond the gate having a distinct look to them compared to those of modern day Japan. \\n\\n\r\nThe people beyond the gate are the most visually interesting though not always in a good way. Their outlines are thicker, instead of clean tonal shading there are shading lines reminiscent of manga and western comics. Their eyes are drawn in a distinctly different style, or at least they are if they are female. \\n\r\nIt's the men of the gate who tend to look a lot worse than their female characters. \\n\\n\r\nIt should be noted that Itami and his team are not ugly by any means, though design wise the male members of the team while distinguishable from each other are not as interesting as the two girls on his team. That is a running theme throughout the show with the female characters being more interesting visually to appeal to the otaku crowd. \\n\\n\r\nThe backgrounds are basic pastel pretty but uninteresting fare, however the Japanese's military equipment is oddly and jarringly gorgeous. Several scenes feature nothing more than military porn, which I have a feeling are the reason the story time skips from time to time, gotta make time for gorgeously animated helicopters, tanks and troops in them. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10 \\n\\n\r\nPretty basic fare here, nothing is amiss here scene wise but the soundtrack will likely only be decorating the shelves of those who are fanatics for the show it's music is wholly forgettable though the guns are satisfying in their clicking and rattling. The opening song while catchy is nearly identical to that of the second season and indeed anything else that band has produced. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 3/10 \\n\\n\r\nGate's other biggest failing. Itami is interesting at first but after entering the gate he stagnates and refuses to develop, he never suffers from real struggles and when faced with dilemmas pulls the most stupid solutions out of his ass that just somehow, breaking all logic, work out. His character goes from reluctant hero otaku to idiot wearing a military uniform. \\n\r\nAnd no one calls him out on his horrible decision making processes. \\n\\n\r\nThe girls while cute and basically different from each other are boring at best. There's the quiet and studious but powerful one, the sexually liberated one, the broken but alluring one who will probably end up with Itami if any one member of his harem becomes a steady love interest. That's a creepy trope by the way, and it only gets worse in the second season but that's another discussion for another time.\\n\\n\r\nOh and who can forget the totally unique and not a prebuilt, no effort required, cliche headstrong, Tsundere, strong in a fight but naive to the real workings of the world princess with (red) pink hair. That was sarcasm by the way, Pina is the most color by the numbers member of the cast and unfortunately the one with the most actual personalty. \\n\\n\r\nItami's actual military team is forgettable, it's male characters blending together and it's female characters one note characters who are quickly sidelined by Itami's new harem. \\n\\n\r\nAny interesting characters are not part of the main cast and forget so quickly by the narrative that I can't even remember their names despite wishing the show was about them instead because they'd be less boring. \\n\\n\r\nThe antagonists are one note, hating on the JSDF simply because it makes for better propaganda and either are killed or humiliated into submission or join the Japanese side for no reason at all. \\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal thoughts: \\n\\n\r\nOn the surface this is an okay if not somewhat enjoyable show but once you think about it, Gate fails. It's mindless otaku fodder and if that's what your watching it for then go for it but if you're looking for something less intellectually insulting and with more substance skip this. \\n\\n\r\nThe pretty art style and cute girls are a trap.",

            "content": "----------SPOILER FREE--------------\r\nTL;DR below for the lazy ones ;)\r\nEver wondered what's it like when an ancient army clashes with modern military? GATE is unique in the way that it presents to us a variety of idea; the clash of armies, the blending of cultures, the true melting pot of Anime.\r\nDo you love Fantasy? Action? Captivating music? Well-crafted and diverse characters?\r\nIf you said \"Yes\" to any of these questions, this gem of an anime is one that you should DEFINITELY catch. (If you said yes to all, you won't fail to orgasm every episode)\r\nMoving on~\r\nStory: 9\r\nThe potential in the concept itself already warrants an 8.\r\nHowever, potential aloneis nothing.\\n\r\nDelicate execution and engaging plot propels this to a solid 9, further supported by the intensity of the developments that leave you begging for more.\\n\r\nDespite the Fantasy theme, GATE attempts inject Reality back into the plot as well. The focus of the show is occasionally shifted back from the\"Special Region\" to Japan, and sequences that occur back in Japan can affect the main plot happening beyond the Gate, adding to the realism of this series. \\n\\n\r\nWhile there are arguably certain flaws in the plot, they shouldn't stop you from enjoying the show at all. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nWhile the art isn't exactly magnificent, it's far from bad.\\n\r\nJust don't expect it to be at Kotonoha no Niwa standard.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the animation (which is fine, really), the characters are really well illustrated (up close) and the vehicles of the JSDF (Eg helicopter, trucks) were well drawn and very detailed.\\n\\n\r\nThe only fault in the art is that the backgrounds were not taken care of properly. Eg if a character was in the background of a certain scene, details could be missing from her in general.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nBoth the OP and ED were beautiful. \\n\r\nOSTs as realistic as they could get: the gunshots, clashing of swords, the helicopters; an experience that shouldn't be missed.\\n\r\nThe Seiyuus were amazing too! (Especially Rory's one)\\n\r\nEvery time I hear her moan I moan as well (It's normal I swear!; Watch it and see for yourself)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\nOften said to be the most attractive aspect of this show: The Characters\\n\r\nMain Character Itami Youji is an otaku (and First Lieutenant) that most of us can associate with. He's funny and surprisingly caring, a character whom you will absolutely love. Having an MC that viewers can understand, relate to and empathise with is evidence of a great Anime.\\n\\n\r\nLelei is a smart 15 year old sorceress apprentice that has taken a particular interest in the Japanese language, often acting as a translator for the Japanese soldiers. Her curiosity and cuteness just makes her a lovable character in the series.\\n\\n\r\nTuka Luna is a elf teen (that isn't as young as she looks) that lost her family and ends up in the care of the JSDF.\\n\\n\r\nLast and definitely not least, Rory Mercury is a (horny) gothic loli demigod that carries around a giant halberd. Her alluring voice and tantalizing demeanor makes you wish that the one she was teasing was you. Yet, she can be unusually deep at times. (If you know what I mean ;)\\n\r\nOf course, there are many other notable characters that all have their own good points, but for the purpose of the review I won't be mentioning all.\\n\\n\r\nWhat constitutes aesthetics? What is true aesthetics? Philosophers can debate for years on the true manifestation of aestheticism. Is it Art? Is it Music? Little do they know that the answer lies in an Anime TV series. A series called GATE. The true embodiment of aesthetics is in characterisation.\\n\\n\r\nOverall/Enjoyment: 9\\n\r\nSadly, the next 3-4 months is going to be a period of hardship that I will gladly endure; the wait for Season 2!\\n\\n\r\nThere are so many reasons why I just love this series; the Fate references during the Special Forces mission, the Ride of the Valkyries Helicopter scene;\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR? Gate presents an unprecedented concept to the fantasy genre. If you enjoy shows like NGNL, SAO, Overlord, or fantasy in general, then this is a show that you will certainly adore. Thank me later :)",

            "content": "To sum up Gate you only need one phrase, DAMN that was a lot of wasted potential! Godfricking DAMMIT, get your shit together Japan!\r\nOn the other hand it was totally expected.\r\nOtaku pandering powerfantasy #militarypropaganda/brainwashing - Gate\r\nStory, Character - 3, 2 (potential 7, 7)\r\nWorlds and culture collide isn't a new idea, disney did it, James Cameron did it, warhammer did it, toaru did it. So really Gate isn't that original on this front, no matter how many times it is done, it is still interesting. A clash of technology and magic, two different worlds, guns vs magic, it makes my inner 10 year old very excited.And if you treat it maturely, the change in culture, the advancement of technology, the political intrigue and all that stuff paired together with a competent MC on a journey and a quest. OH I'm getting excited just thinking about it, imagine all the awesome...\\n\\n\r\nWait...what? This sack of unoriginal otaku self-insert is our MC...Well, Sh*t\\n\\n\r\nThat's right all potential poof went up the air, when the show showed its hand in the opening 5 minutes, a otaku soldier talking about otaku sh*t. You know I remember long time ago, there were MC's with so much charisma and character that you can't help but love them where papers could be written about their development. These days I wish I could just take up a chainsaw hammer and smash the MC's face in, but they are so flat I doubt there is anything to smash.\\n\\n\r\nOur MC Youji is an current JSDF soldier who also happen to be an otaku, and while fulfilling his hobby, another world attack. Our MC \"bravely\" dealt with it like a soldier. Afterwards we are told that a gate leading to a magic world appeared in Japan and the JSDF is sent in, and etc. (which you can just see the anime to learn about)\\n\\n\r\nBack to ranting about wasted potential. Why was the military sent in like that? Aren't the JSDF about defending Japanese territory not invading someone elses? Where are all the other countries armies? You would think that the knowledge that another world exist would send the world into a frenzy with every country scrambling to get in, but nope only japan goes. (And have any succeed with the locals but this part is spoiler for the anime) Seeing this basically convinced me that the author is jerking off to his otaku patriotism at this point.\\n\\n\r\nAnd through the gate we reach a generic fantasy world which is even more obvious pandering. I mean loli-gothic-catgirl(?)-wielding a halberd who is attracted to the MC and turned on by killing? Big tities blonde elf? When you have seen a lot of fantasy you know this is elementary stuff that is overused every where, for once I would like to see a fantasy world that is more fantasy, something like Monster hunter, giant mountain like monsters, creepy forest that suck out your soul, terrible extradimensional diseases that turns people into abomination. You know the kind of stuff you expect military man to face in a hostile unknown world and die by droves as mankind struggle with both the benefit and terrible cost of accessing an unknown world.\\n\\n\r\nBut that would make too good of a story, instead of that have some more none PTSD soldier MC having hijinks with hot fantasy waifu. There are some actions, the helicopter bits were good, and there were some good military tactics and things. But it could have been so much MORE, having soldiers as a MC is suppose to take us out of the otaku comfort zone and show some real hardcore things, like killing alien abominations, tragic lose of human lives during wars, people unable to get over their PTSD as memories of their died comrades hunt them for decades of their life, and scientists around the world using knowledge from this new world to make discoveries that are both beneficial and terrible. World in a frenzy as countries tear each other to shreds to get a piece of the pie or to get as far away as possible.\\n\\n\r\nBut nope, it is the same old pandering thing, I mean we have an otaku MC, waifus, \"JSDF is never wrong\" mentality, light-hearted fun mixed with pointless edgy (which have no effect on our MC's mentality). This is an author jerking off to his patriotism and fetishes and I'm so sick of it!\\n\\n\r\nGo watch log horizon or western media if you want to watch a better clash of culture.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 7\\n\r\nClean, it is okay, nothing bad, but nothing awe-inspiring either, but that is just what A-1 is like.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8\\n\r\nOkay, but it doesn't make the show any more suffer able.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 2\\n\r\nEvery second I spend on this show was a reminder that Japan couldn't get its sh*t together and how the medium is pandering more and more to the lowest denominator. With the tide of adaptation moving more and more to the WN shows like Overlord and Gate, I fear for the future of anime that is going down the toilet right now.\\n\\n\r\nNow I'm going to play Witcher and Touhou for a while to wash this bad taste of fantasy from my mouth.",

It's no the same as Oda Nobuna no Yabou or Outbreak Company, but if you enjoyed either of them you will find this one interesting. \r\nCharacter:\r\nI really like how the characters are presented. Simply said all the main characters are badass in their own way. \r\nSound: \r\nThe SFX is good. i actually found this anime while listening to one of favoriteclassical songs (if you watch it you will know which song i am talking about). The sounds doing the action scenes are not bad. They have some detail put into them so you can hear the difference between the guns.",

            "content": "I, for one, was drawn into the intriguing world that Gate drops us in, but the real question is what else does Gate manage to do besides having an interesting premise?\r\nThe premise and the mystery surrounding the so called \"Special Realm\" are the strongest points of the show by far, however the execution felt a little lacking in the story department. The battle scenes show how ridiculously one sided this war is between the two realms, which detracts from the suspense of the story as the outcome of any battle is never in doubt. Coupled by the fact that one of the protagonist is literaryinvincible make the SDF and their friends virtually unbeatable.\\n\r\n Despite this, the moments showcasing the might of the SDF still manage to be engaging as it really made me think of the morality of the war, or rather, the slaughter that takes place. Also the rampant nationalism gets old real quick in this show, as Japan is the best at everything, everything they make is amazing, basically all I can picture is Japanese Big Brother nodding in approval after seeing how the might of Japan is mentioned once again. Another point of annoyance for myself were the constant mentioning to otaku, and how it felt at times that moments had been crafted to fulfill some otaku fantasy checklist rather than advance the plot. At times it felt like the creator was thinking more along these lines: I know you like cat girls, so here's one and a bunch of fanservice to go with it, and just to sweeten the deal, here's a bath scene, you can thank me later, you otaku you. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot isn't really anything to call home about, but gets the job done and sets up some questions about the realm from both sides, and kind of surprisingly focuses on the political aspect of the situation from both sides. As I mentioned before at times it certainly heads down the path of the cliche , but at the same time does manage to patch in some engaging actions scenes at the same time, as well as humor from time to time. Nice guy Itami is the typical male lead who only works to supplement his otaku tendencies, and at times it feels like his character and his skill are just a little too convenient for someone of his background. Most of the other characters are pretty much husks, besides Rory who provides some of the more interesting moments, but also hinders some moments due to her immense power. I found that one character introduced later in the series really added a lot of depth to Itami and his character, but unfortunately she only stuck around for  a short time. \\n\r\nI found the music to fit in well with the action scenes and the series, and think that the OP of the series really stands out. The art is visually pleasing as well, I can't even complain about the CGI, which is used minimally and fits in without being too intrusive.\\n\r\nOverall, Gate has a strong concept that will initially get you hooked, but the pieces of the story aren't nearly as strong as its premise, and I felt that at times the narrative fell into some of the usual anime cliches. The constant mentioning of the Japan's might and otaku culture also result in some weird alienating moments from the narrative, taking me out of the immersive world. I would say that Gate is definitely worth checking out, but if the world itself is not able to keep you occupied than you may find yourself tuning out earlier than expected.",

            "content": "When I was young(er), my favorite day dream was time travel. The exploits of my journey are outlined as follows: A) Time travel to a feudal era of crude weaponry. B) Bring automatic weapons/explosives. C) Wipe out a nation's army. D) Plunder hot women and treasures. \r\nC\u2019mon guys, don\u2019t act like this dream hasn\u2019t crossed your minds?! ARMY OF DARKNESS \u2013movie plug! If this scenario tickles your fancy/fetish, then GATE just might be the anime for you.\r\nStory: 7. Perhaps imaginative is singularly the best word to describe GATE. The story is basically about a time/space traveling gate that links two worlds together \u2013 a fantasticalfeudal world with elves, demigods, dragons, and wizards, and modern day Japan and their interactions. Extremely helpful is the succinct recap that precedes most episodes. Story is also very pro-Japan, as if it were the epicenter of the universe. Even made the US look like bumbling clowns at times :). Enough of the overview.\\n\\n\r\nOne major gripe: more action! I repeat, I demand DOMINATION! In all seriousness, the first couple episodes were satisfying to watch modern technology go tet-a-tet with swords and spears. Oh man, thousands of people mowed down in an instant with superior weaponry*cue evil grin*. In one memorable scene, combat helicopters laid the smack down and decimated shield bearing knights. MUHAHHAAH! That\u2019s my kind of fan-service! Alas, mid-series, the warfare settles down and the impetus of the narrative focuses on the \u201cother-world foreigners\u201d being acquainted with modern Japanese culture and vice-versa. I must admit, it was sorta fascinating to live vicariously through the eyes of a pre-modern person. The first subway ride, the first fast food, the first clothes shopping experience\u2026 But wasn't this supposed to be a gun show?\\n\\n\r\nSecond major gripe: there isn\u2019t one identifiable climax, and the denouement is WAY too long. I feel like the anime could have easily ended at episode 10. The last 2 episodes, excuse my french, were BORING. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7. You\u2019re typical garden-variety animation. I think the most memorable artwork revolves around Rory Mercury\u2019s action sequences. My love, Rory! She is not only Waifu material, but sick nasty in combat. That Lolita-gothic theme brings all the boyz to yard! The attention to detail on the Hummers, tanks, and helicopters are noted as well. Sadly, other action sequences were not as thoughtfully realized. Some sequences were merely static pictures that violently shook and had people screaming. Can we say 80\u2019s anime? Budget-cutz. Overall, art was acceptable.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 7. Typical fare music, meaning that it neither got in the away of the story or was outstanding. I usually always skip the beginning and ending music sequences.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7. Rory Mercury! My Waifu 4 Life-fu! Okay, I\u2019ll stop. Characters are flat, 2D and static. Anime is much more plot driven than character driven. Not a bad thing for an action/adventure anime. Most character were not as engaging, except my true love Rory!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8. Did anyone mention that GATE is funny?  For instance, a fansub translated a phrase, \u201cThe invading army fires explosives that look like giant iron cocks!\u201d Hilarious. A queen called Pina Co Lada? I rest my case. While the MAL genre tag of action, adv, fantasy, military is absolutely correct, I\u2019d say this is equally comical. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, while GATE isn\u2019t high on my rewatchable list, it was mindless fun. Actually, real fun. If you need to decompress and watch a relatively clean anime with some genuine humor and imagination, this just might be the anime for you.\\n",

            "content": "Modern VS Ancient Fantasy warfare? I don't know about you but that sounded mighty appealing to me. So I was delighted the moment my friend recommended Gate: Jieitai Kanochi nite, Kaku Tatakaeri. \r\nStory: Clashing modern warfare vs an ancient one (with bits of fantasy elements in them) is the main point of this anime. Modern Japan being attacked by all sort of monsters and magicked creatures form another realm was what they first presented. One would expect a very long and bloody back and forth rally between the two factions as most war related titles are, but how this anime deviated from that cliche isone of the series' charm. Anyone who has a love for war themed titles will love this for its unique and realistic approach.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art isn't what I would call awe inspiring but it isn't bad either. The overall is just average, but what I like about this anime are the designs and the thought that's been put to them. That means no outrageous appearances for the normal humans while the Special Region characters are well designed. from the human race to the dragons. And lets not forget about the non living parts of the anime. The world at the Special Region was well designed, as well as the war machines. Tanks, choppers, guns. Name them.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound is one of the nicest points of the anime. They've got a quite well rounded seiyuu roster, each perfectly brings out the characters colors. The OP theme is suited for the anime's exciting feel (totally unrelated but fun tip: If you want a more intense feel, play the opening video of this anime and mute the sound, playing SNK's opening Guren no Yumiya instead. IT FITS!) and the ED theme sounds really lighthearted and I think it suits the other side of the series. The effects are not lacking, what with all the gunshots and bombs and everything else that's been used. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Now comes my favorite part. Characters are always important to me whenever I watch anything. You can give me a total let down with good, relatable characters and I will enjoy it. For this series though, I am very please with almost everyone. I'm not really into harem types so I was quite wary of what the character might be like before I started watching this, but to my surprise, Itami is a very realistic character. Easy going, lazy otaku who is actually a very fine soldier. Some might think that this is cliche, but how Itami faces everything is very refreshing. Then you have your mighty Goddess type gothic lolita, a smart, cool mage, a coping elf, and a feisty but worrisome princess. Everyone has got a lot of potential and I'm more pleased to say that they're not annoying. The supporting characters are also intriguing enough not to be set aside. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I first watched this series expecting a lot of deaths and angst and all those dark stuffs (which I really like) and one might think that I must be disappointed as this series is not any of those, but nope. This is one of my most enjoyed animes for the year so far. Realistic in its approach without being a drag. My only con point here is that it is too short. As I've mentioned, the series has many good points, including its wide array of interesting characters and the limited episodes doesn't do much justice to that. It's good that it has a confirmed new season for next year and I'm definitely looking out for that one. \\n",

            "content": "Finally! An anime series with modern military that I can actually call good because it is very hard to find a great modern military anime this days. Plus, it's a modern military vs medieval army so that's an added bonus considering the fact that I'm a fan of both sides. \r\n[Story]: (8/10)\r\nIn August of 20XX, a portal to a parallel world, known as the \"Gate\" suddenly appeared in Ginza, Tokyo. Monsters and troops poured out of the portal, turning the shopping district into a bloody inferno. The JGSDF (Japan Ground-Self Defence Force) took action and pushed back the creatures into the Gate. The JGSDF hasdispatched the Third Reconnaissance Team to the \"Special Region\" at the other side of the Gate. \\n\\n\r\nYou don't know how happy I am right now to finally find an anime series with modern military that actually uses tanks, jets, helicopter and artillery. Most animes today uses mechas which pisses me off because I like to see modern and historical battles. None of this fake-ass flying robots bullshit.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways..just like the synopsis, a \"Gate\" appeared out of nowhere and the military has been sent to investigate the other side. On the other side, they found out that the beings we believe as fantasy exists on the other side of the gate. Magic, mages, elves, dragons, and etc..they're there.  \\n\\n\r\nThe show is mainly focused on Itami, a 33 year old otaku who prefers his hobby than his work. He and his platoon saved a bunch of refugees along with 3 girls who is a mage, an elf and a demi-god. That's what happened on the first 3 or 4 episodes. Later on, some politics stuff happened and they even showed that the US, China and Russia are a bunch of greedy officials who would take the \"mysterious\" land for their own. How ironic.. Then more plot points appear but revealing more of the plot points will lead to spoilers.  In short, it's one problem to another that would get eventually solved by Itami's platoon or other characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe only part I didn't like about the show is the pacing.. There's a bunch of time skips in the show and the first few episodes were slightly rushed. A-1 adapted this anime so I'm not really surprised that there would be time-skips and rushed pacing. In the 2nd half of the series, the pacing does slow down so I got a break from the fast mindless action. \\n\\n\r\nI'm just a bit irritated that they decided to split the show into 2 seasons instead of a 25 episode continuous run (Yes..show ends on a cliffhanger) but if you look at shows like Akame Ga Kill and Soul Eater, you'd be glad that they decided to continue the rest of the episodes next year. I'd rather wait than get a shitty rushed original anime plot that's not even in the manga. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: (9/10)\\n\r\nIf you've seen some A-1 adapted animes before then you should be familiar with the animation at first glance. It's looks the same as their previously worked animes. The environment does look great, especially the the other world. The action scenes are very smooth. Especially the scenes were the 2 sides are fighting and the scene where Rory is fighting with her giant-ass sword. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Sound]: (9.4/10)\\n\r\nOne word...Awesome! The soundtrack used for the battle scenes are amazing, even the themes used for conversations/fooling around scenes are great. Also, the Ride of the Valkyrie scene. Oh, How I love that classic theme.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP theme song is GATE: Sore wa Akatsuki no you ni\" by Kishida Kyoudan & The Akeboshi Rockets and the ED theme song is Prism Communicate\" by Rory VA, Tuka VA, and Lelei VA. I am now in love with both the OP and ED theme song. The OP has this rock-type version accompanied with action scenes that fits the song. I love how the opening makes me want to join the JSDF. Showing off their military power and might. Ahh, propaganda at its finest. The ED is more like a cutesy song that was sung by the VA of 3 main female characters. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Character]: (9/10)\\n\r\nWhen I first read the synopsis and saw the cover, I thought that this was going to be a harem because Itami is an otaku and he is surrounded by 3 fantasy girls. Thank god, it didn't turn out that way. A harem consists of at least 3 girls who is in love with the same guy. The thing is only 2 girls have feelings for Itami. So basically, it's a love triangle but not a serious one. Anyways...\\n\\n\r\nItami is a 33 year old otaku who works for the JSDF..At the first episode, I thought Itami is going to be full of BS..I mean, how can an otaku fight like that (as demonstrated in the first episode) then you find out he's with the JSDF. That figures...Guess what, he's also a first lieutenant and he's with the goddamn Special Forces (equivalent to US Delta Force). He's an otaku and he's also a near-top military official? Yep, I official like this character. \\n\\n\r\nThen there's the 3 main female character which was saved by Itami's platoon. Lelei la Lalena is a 15 year old human (from the other world) training to be a mage. She loves books and she's a very intelligent and smart teenager. She quickly learned Japanese so she became an interpreter for the JGSDF. You know what I love about her? Her calm looks. She looks calm all the time, literally. You barely see her smiling. Tuka Marceau is a 165 year old elf who is considered a teenager in their race's standards. Something tragic happened to her before she got rescued and I don't really want to spoil it. The final main female character is Rory Mercury. She is over 900 years old and is a demi-god. I don't get how some people like her? I don't like her. Her voice is goddamn annoying and her sex noises are also irritating. I do like it when she goes out and fight using that sword of hers. \\n\\n\r\nBesides Rory, none of the characters were annoying. Hell, even Itami who I expected to be the most annoying when he's around girls is not an annoying MC. He can get a little pervy around girls sometimes but he doesn't drool all the time around those 3 girls that he saved. He also tends to be funny when he shows his otaku side. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Military and Weaponry accuracy]: (9.5/10) (This does not count towards my OVERALL rating)\\n\r\nAs a military and war fanatic, I felt like I have to review this section too.  I'm going to make this as short as possible.\\n\\n\r\nDid they portray the JSDF right? Yes, they portrayed them almost perfectly. From tactics to the guns they're using, they got it. They're using a Type-64 Assault Rifle which is not the most modern weaponry and they got that right because Japan has cut back on their military costs. They also used a Panzerfaust 3 to fight off the Red Dragon.\\n\\n\r\nWere the military vehicles and weaponry accurate? Yes..They got the Hind right which is an AH-1 Cobra which is used by the JGSDF today. They also got the choppers right which is a Huey. A chopper with gun emplacements on both sides. It is currently used by the JGSDF today. As for the tanks. They were using a Type-74 MBT which is currently used by the JGSDF today. Lastly, the jets. It was shown that they were using a F-4EJ Phantom. \\n\\n\r\nI'm impressed with the show's military and weaponry accuracy. They really did their research or the director probably had greater knowledge when it comes to JGSDF and their military. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]: (10/10)\\n\r\nThis has now become my most favorite anime of the year. I never got bored with the show and I was always on the edge of my seat. It's also nice to see that they portrayed the military almost perfectly because as a war and military fanatic, that's what I'd like to see. Not some fake-ass shit\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[OVERALL]: (9/10)\\n\r\n\"Gate: And so the Special Defense Force Fought Back\" is one of the best modern military anime I have ever seen. It also has fantasy stuff like magic, elfs, mages, etc that is sure to please the fans who likes Fantasy era. If you're a fan of military genre or the fantasy genre then you might want to give this show a try. I'm warning you though..Once you start watching the show, it will be very hard to stop watching. It's very addicting\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Story is Very Well Done\\n\r\n+Great Animation\\n\r\n+Great Soundtrack, especially the \"Ride of the Valkyrie\" theme.\\n\r\n+Great Characters\\n\r\n+Show almost perfectly portrayed the JSDF and their weaponry/military vehicles\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Pacing issues",

Many are very detailed modern approaches to how to act in foreign territory, local our mutual cooperation, the escalating use of force, all these details are present in the anime.\r\nAlso at the level of use of military material is very detailed, always wearing a bulletproof vest with collars (It seems silly, but they are very unpleasant to wear), including the disposition of weapon down during transport (avoid damage to the face in an accident) not using night vision goggles for day to avoid damaging them, the elastic strap... For me as a military is like watching peers from another country during an operation factly, beating all warlike animes I've seen so far in realism. There are also some concessions as a work of fiction, but everything is on the edge between realism and entertainment work.\\n\\n\r\nThe mix of fantasy and realism is exquisite and is a fantastic \"what if ...\"",

            "content": "Gate is a failed attempt at an anime that supposed to show how our work would react if we found a different magical dimension that we could travel to. \r\nStory: The story of Gate is 4 so I consider it decent, I find it pretty cool they show how the army would react and how a magic world would react to our worlds tech and military artillery I have to say the way they portray the magic world is awful because the only thing we know about it is how the military work and how the army works. They don't spend enough time on thetownspeople or how their culture is different from ours and i know some of you are thinking \"But they don't need to explain how the magic world works because we've already seen it a million times\" and that's where I tell you they do need to show it because the audience is looking through the perspective of the military so the military doesn't know anything about this world so it makes sense that should explain how this world works and how the townspeople act plus how different their culture is different from ours. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation: The animation is fine but it's nothing super well done since there ins't much to look at except shooting and a couple of slaps from some the girls and the walking where there is a bunch of. \\n\\n\r\nSound: The music isn't anything special is kind of boring and generic for a military type of show. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: I dislike most the girl characters because most of them are walking cliches and have no personality expect the way they adore the main character and the way they react to the military going through the gate, also they can be it into an archetype and that just sums up their character and how'll they'll be for the rest of the show. The guy characters are fine and are tolerable.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall Gate is an escapist fantasy for teenage guys to get off to animal girls in a magical world and has a poorly written story and characters that have no thought put into them",

            "content": "In france, where I live, if you ask someone to describe Japan, he or she will usually answer the following sentence : \"A country mixing tradition and modernity\".\r\nGate: Jieitai Kanochi nite, Kaku Tatakaeri tends to perfectly fit to this description. Indeed, it brings a contemporary Japan with all its armament, to travel a Gate leading to another world. As you can guess, this world is based on a fantasy Middle-age (even Antiquity I think) with a bit of magic. And the whole show was either directed by Michael Bay or written under LSD.\r\nThe whole point of this anime appears - at first - to bea great battlefield opposing our world with its tanks, assault rifles, machineguns, choppers and even fighter jets ; and soldiers wearing bronze or steel armor and having only spears or shields. Quite an unfair outcome obviously ! But what could be positive (or not, say the blood thirsty watchers) is that our humanity is mostly shown as merciful, understanding and willing to create a peace climate. I might disappoint some people but... you won't get to see a whole show of poor soldiers being slaughtered under Richard Wagner's \"Ride of the Valkyries song\".\\n\\n\r\nYes you read it correctly : they dared using this glorious (meme) military song to accompany a fight where brigands get literally blew up under attack choppers and their soldiers. I rarely watched such joyful, even orgasmic miltary anime...\\n\\n\r\nHowever, do not get distracted by the global warfare atmosphere that might appear in your head, reading my previous lines. Gate: Jieitai Kanochi nite, Kaku Tatakaeri introduces a lot of characters (one might say too many on some point and he or she would not be wrong) and many of them are catchy, attractive and pleasant to follow on their adventures. You actually get to discover many profiles, going from the classic heartwarmed soldier, the elf, the dark loli or the military superior being overwhelmed by his subordinate's low behaviour.\\n\\n\r\nThe global story line cannot be completed by season one and in fact, season starts with episode 13 instead of a complete new episode 1. I highly recommend this show for both military thema lovers and fantasy fans. And if you are none, maybe watching a fire dragon being killed by kilos of C4, Rocket launchers will catch your attention. Same goes with her kids getting shot by both fighter jets and artilery.\\n\\n\r\nEdit : after reading every chapters of the manga that concerned season 1's events, I have now a second point of view to share. Indeed, surprisingly, the anime is extremely loyal to its written parent, covering everything shown on the paper. It even added a better introduction, episode 1 covering more of Gate's first battle which was quite eluded in the manga.\\n\\n\r\nOtherwise, I think almost everything looked alike if we were to compare both versions. However I noticed season 2 received a lot of cuts contrary to the original chapters. Easy to figure out they faced a lack of available screentime, so it was obvious some tiny parts (or not so tiny) had to be removed. Anyway, if you appreciated Gate's animated version, you should get along with the written version ! It is still on 'Publishing' status by the way.",

            "content": "GATE, I could've sworn I saw this at 24 episodes and when I finished the 12th episode I could not believe what I saw. I was really let down by that, but onto the review. And I can't stress this enough, if you're an anime apologist, don't even bother reading this review or any of my reviews. If you're open minded, welcome.\r\nA gate appears OUTTA NOWHERE, and came rushing the empire's army, indiscriminately slaughtering the citizens of Japan. And now, our otaku military genius protagonist, Itami, swoops in and saves the day and meets cute fantasy girls that any anime/manga fan dreams of. There, beginsthe story of GATE. It's an interesting plot that'll have you coming back out of curiosity and quite honestly, enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nThe world beyond the gate and it's citizens aren't anything inspiring or unique, to say. It's about a fairly above average fantasy setting. But it's good that way, otherwise modern technology, being one of the key elements in the series, to be underwhelmed by unlimited magical powers. The art and animation is consistent throughout the series. It's nothing special but it proves itself to be a great effort. And I applause it for that.\\n\\n\r\nThe way the show ended, I can't find myself to say the show is anything other than just good. Not amazing, not horrendous, but good. The voice acting is good enough to keep you entertained throughout the watch. The soundtrack is okay, I never really noticed it as there were plenty of scenes that didn't actually have background music, or either that, it was too low. Additionally, the opening and ending songs are quite good. I enjoyed listening to them. As well as the opening and ending themselves, they convey what the series is about, helping others and creating peace between the two world.\\n\\n\r\nItami is yet another brown hair protagonist archetype, but unlike the rest of the shitty characters I've seen like that, Itami offers a a lot more scope and range to him. We learn that he's more than what he seems, but more subtle, and not too exaggerated that it would've killed the mood. While I don't feel like he puts up anything new to the table, he definitely is a well crafted main protagonist. And for the three girls that accompany him, Lelei is simply a young magician, Rory is a demi-god, and Tuka is an elf that lost her clan to a fire dragon. That's as deep as those characters get. For the rest of the cast like the other green people and fantasy characters, they are alright. They do their part and it moves right back to Itami and co.. It's interesting to see the fantasy characters interact with the modern world, and it shows the better parts of the three girls that follow Itami, as well as, yes, Pina Co Lada.\\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy this show? Yes, I did, but I just feel like 12 episodes and how the series left on a cliff hanger, kind of thing, weakened the show very much. I hear it's getting a season 2 but it leaves a conflict waiting to be resolved that was introduced as a sort of new arc. And that is not a good thing to do, even though I understand why not a lot of series can get a full 24 episode show right then and there, having to wait another season or two to get a continuation.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum everything up, overall, this show barely misses a recommendation and bad ass seal of approval (Angry Joe!!!). Though it wouldn't hurt to check it out if you have time but not something I will say you must watch NOW.",

            "content": "Gate could've been a story of modern vs old, with a bit of cultural exchange; instead it went down the otaku pandering route, combined with absurd amounts of right-wing nationalism.\r\nIt is a real shame, since there were some genuinely interesting comparisons, such as the difference of how prisoners are treated by the Japanese army compared to the medieval army, but these scenes are barely touched upon, as if the writer was only using the scenes to say \"Japan is the good guy! Everyone else is the bad guy!\"\r\nIn fact, that seems to be the running theme throughout the series. Japan is presented as the GoodTeam 100% of the way. Everything the JSDF does is unanimously praised, while the Americans, the Chinese, the opposing medieval armies, and even the Japanese DIET that oppose the invasion are portrayed as being evil, greedy, or just plain imbecilic. As the show continued, it became more and more like Japanese military propaganda rather than a legitimate story. Any and all enemies are helplessly mowed down by the superior might of the Japanese Army and the immortal death god (who looks like a thirteen year old girl) that joins them. This doesn't exactly lead to tense battles, since it's quite obvious who's going to win every time, and the show doesn't even try to hide it.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters? Well, there is the protagonist, Itami, who is an otaku (who also happens to be a top-class soldier with a heart of gold), his squad, and a bunch of underage multi-color haired girls (except they're elves and demigods, so they're actually hundreds of years old!). None of these characters undergo any sort of development, and their personalities are practically non-existent. They exist to be cute girls, and that is it. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, it was somewhat fun to watch the cultural exchanges that took place, and I cannot say in good conscience that I didn't enjoy myself. But I feel that Gate could've been a lot more than mindless entertainment, so I can't help but be disappointed.",

            "content": "A gate to a medieval fantasy land opens up in Japan, and this can only mean one thing: sword-wielding troops get mowed down by the glorious Japanese military in their attack copters with Wagner playing. And I mean that in-universe; the soldiers are literally playing a CD of Wagner in their copters.\r\nWhy, you ask? Because Japan needs more technology and minerals and such because nationalism says so. Oh, and some humanitarian reasons, but those aren't as important. \r\nThe plot kicks off when out of nowhere a gate appears and from it come a bunch of orcs and medieval troops that indiscriminately kill civilians, wreck theplace and interrupt the otaku event the protagonist was planning to visit. As so it happens, the protagonist is not only an otaku but also a member of the SDF (Japanese military), and once the initial attack has been dealt with, he joins the force sent through the gate. \\n\\n\r\nThis fantasy land is declared a part of Japan, named the Special Region, because why not? (Nice name, by the way; that's what I'd call a fantasy land too if I ever occupied one.) The Japanese constitution forbids (at the moment, anyway) deploying the SDF abroad, but I guess that's one way around it: just annex territory arbitrarily and suddenly it's all Japanese soil. Some fighting ensues, but no worries: their enemies are so outgunned they might as well be throwing rocks at them. Aside from the technology gap, these feudal lords also come from the Zapp Brannigan school of tactics with plans like:\\n\r\n1. Suicidal charge,\\n\r\n2. Suicidal charge, and\\n\r\n3. Suicidal charge under the cover of night (worth a shot, I guess?)\\n\\n\r\nActually, that was kind of the idea behind the original invasion into Japan: go to an unknown land without any intel or recon and slaughter everything for fun and profit. ...Yeah.\\n\\n\r\nSoon enough our merry band can venture further into this land while talking about their waifus and singing magical girl theme songs, eager to meet the local catgirls. In the process they recruit mages, elves and goth lolis. The writers thought the SDF wasn't overpowered enough, so the goth loli happens to be an invincible demigod priestess who effortlessly crushes everything in her path. The tone of the show is what you might expect, with slaughter and fanservice taking turns. What is a hot bath scene without people's arms flying off afterwards?\\n\\n\r\nThere is also a cultural clash going on, which is used for dialogue like:\\n\r\n\"I had no idea our world had [insert everyday thing here].\"\\n\r\n\"Princess, this is another world!\"\\n\r\n\"Oh, right!\"\\n\r\nRepeat it a few times and you have comedy gold.\\n\\n\r\nSome of the cultural misunderstandings actually make sense, such as the different interests of a feudal society and a modern country, the treatment of prisoners or the idea of throwing a half-naked woman at the protagonist to earn his favor. Actually, the last one just might have worked if he hadn't been distracted by all the animal girl maids already. And who can blame him for being distracted? Barely dressed girls keep throwing themselves at him out of coincidence or because he's just that awesome.\\n\\n\r\nIf it isn't obvious by now, the operation beyond the Gate is a one-country effort. Sharing resources with others? Don't be ridiculous. The US, Russia and China (the rest of the world doesn't exist) don't deserve their slice of the cake. Especially America. \"A sky with no civilian or US planes in it is a dream come true\" for Japanese fighters.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, this is all run by the SDF. Civilian personnel? Media presence? Dream on. All we need is the SDF. Who else would defend Japanese interests? The Japanese government is corrupt and easily swayed. The parliament is a bunch of idiots who want to mess with the SDF's business for no reason. How dare they ask questions about civilian casualties under a media blackout? Eventually there is an entire town for the locals, with shops and everything. Would now be a time to bring in civilians? No, that could get in the way of the runaway militarism we have going on. To maintain order, some of the locals are actually given armbands with \"Military Police\" on them. \\n\\n\r\nThe visuals include machine guns, missiles, tanks, artillery, copters and fighters, which is nice. Sadly most of the soundtrack is not Wagner, which is a shame because that would be poetic justice.\\n\\n\r\nBy the way, it is never explained how the Gate was built. Did the Empire build it (which I kind of doubt) or just find it? Are there more of them? If you are after fantasy tech, shouldn't this be near the top of your list? Think about it: you could discover a Stargate network and explore even more worlds for even more glorious nationalism! But nope, never mentioned.\\n\\n\r\nNow let's all take a moment and salute the Japanese flag flying in the distance.",

            "content": "Two worlds, different dimensions, one is fantasy and the other one are reality. If these two existences merge with one gate, what will the future hold for both worlds? \r\nGate: jieitai kanochi nite kaku tatakaeri or also known as Gate start the show with a bit unique performance and leave the viewers speechless while trying to grasp the situation. I'll admit, on the surface this series doesn't sound like it would make a good series. Add more with the main lead Youji Itami who\u2019s already aged 33 years old. One of the most courageous steps I\u2019ve ever seen. Anime industries have laid teenagers as themain character for a long time. Gate on the other hand; put a matured and adult man as their main lead which is rather impressive. Unfortunately, our hero is kind of biased with the other main characters who have loved anime and manga deeply. However, I must commend this series because the producers have been doing a good job to develop those characters in series well along with communicating on a larger theme about humanity in general.\\n\\n\r\nGate: jieitai kanochi nite kaku tatakaeri will be one of the most popular anime soon enough and definitely for a good reason. The series start its pace rather slow at first but very effective, and refreshing for the better understanding. \\n\\n\r\nThe technical aspects of the show are really good. Though Gate never loses its character focus, the idea of spending a lot of time exploring political, economics, philosophical and a wide variety of subjects about the fantasy world can be very boring but important for us to understand the motivations of certain characters. As well it is necessary to understand the series better. In terms, the series try it\u2019s best to describe the best path for humanity against this fictional world. It has its merits and its flaws, but above all it is not simple. This issue is rather complex to be discussing or used in anime series and yet Gate does a nicely job showing the themes. \\n\\n\r\nDespite what I\u2019ve said, the realistic way the Gate tries to show sometime can be frustrating with lack of the deeper themes. The plot is actually quite smart but also a little complex than it seem. Still, the developments in the series just makes you want to dive deeper and deeper into the series. The interaction between all the characters is well managed as for the feel of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation of this series is very nice indeed. Gate background has been designed with the best effort, vivid colors and lines to stylize the characters in a way. The art has been nicely drawn with a lit bit of different style to makes more realistic. Either way, both the art and animation is incredible created for the Gate series. The high-end action is carefully placed and definitely top notch. The value of background is clearly be valued by Gate series.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is really cool, with the outstanding Op and Eds, capturing the viewer\u2019s eye within the series. This is really stunning aspects. Not to mention the sound effects, adding with the previous two, this takes the series to a new stage of fantastic and admiration. \\n\\n\r\nIn a sense, Gate is one of the best shows I've seen in a while. I\u2019m not particular boasting about this series. Because Gate is an excellent and enraging works that\u2019s doesn\u2019t lose the main theme focus, the characters never lost their main aim and building up a good relationship among each others. While on the other hand, Gate also focusing a number of high class issues and problems that chained this world for a long time. Gate is definitely a brilliant piece of surreal fantasy fiction that works on nearly every level. If you against the idea of political or philosophical exploration just skip those episodes but it will be a great loss and definitely will affecting your view of the series. Honestly, I can't complain about this series at all. On a purely level, this piece of series was impressive. \\n",

            "content": "GATE, a simple 4 letter word that can release so much potential with its premise. The idea behind GATE is that of a series about modernized humans clashing with fantasy (warriors wielding ancient armor, elves, dwarves, dragons, etc). By clashing, it doesn\u2019t entirely mean a total war between the two sides. After a while, both sides begins to establish a diplomatic relationship with one another. Sounds strange right? It also kind of goes in a two-fold. Fantasy enters reality and reality enters fantasy. Both worlds are separated by a gate and at the center of it, there\u2019s a man named Youji Itami. \r\nGate - JieitaiKare no Chi nite Kaku Tatakaeri (Gate - Thus the JSDF Fought There) or simply known as GATE is a television series that adapts the light novel of the same name. It was originally serialized online on a novel website called \u201cArcadia\u201d but later got published as a book in 2010. The series also has a manga that is based on the story with the same main characters. Speaking of which, Itami is the main male protagonist of the show and it\u2019s easy for us to get familiarized with him. Despite being a soldier, he\u2019s actually quite more like an otaku with his fascination for fantasy. This lands him in a position where he happily investigates the fantasy world beyond the GATE. Little does he know that is more than what he can bite off.\\n\\n\r\nThe show itself adapts many elements that blurs between lines of fiction and reality. The fiction part obviously comes with the fantasy creatures like elves, dragons, and even a demi-god. JSDF (Japan Self-Defense Forces) has more of the reality role. Their military is equipped with high level technology and hence were able to fight against the fantasy world in the beginning. There was even an infamous event known as the \u201cGinza Incident\u201d when monsters appeared in the Ginza, a real world location and made a memorable massacre. Of course, JSDF responded fiercely and showed that humanity is a doorknob to absolutely nobody. By establishing such a premise, it\u2019s no wonder that the show has a lot of potential. Think about it really, when you have a war that is more than just about imperialism, it shows how much it can evolve. Throughout the story of GATE, we see much of that with cultural, political, and military themes.\\n\\n\r\nGATE\u2019s characters are highly diverse not just because of personalities but by races. No, I\u2019m not just talking about nationalities but also non-humans. The main core consists of three girls \u2013 Tuka Luna Mareau (a 165 year old elf), Lelei La Rellena (a 15 year old human from the fantasy world), and Rory Mercury (a demi-goddess who is apparently over 900 years old). These characters have different personalities but also creates fascination as they enter the real world. What we witness throughout the story is how they adapt with real world concepts such as modern life technology and politics. Additionally, a plus side about the show is that the human characters are fairly mature. Itami is an older male (as opposed to the high school teenagers you\u2019d commonly see these days) and has a strong interest in otaku. His military experience also gives him an edge when negotiating with certain parties and we see a lot of what he is capable of throughout the story. His relationship with co-workers from the Third Recon unit also gives us a firm idea of his personality \u2013 a casual guy who is kind at heart and easily able to make friends with others. \\n\\n\r\nFrom the fantasy world, there are also other regions that establishes the clever creativity of this how. For instance, there\u2019s the special region that is composed of an empire with a diverse cast of characters. Pina, the princess of that empire, hopes to establish peace with Japan. There are obvious reasons for this but the show also affirms her personality as a proud princess who is caring towards her people. Furthermore, the show has a strong emphasis of its world fiction. Landscapes and towns are built with resourceful elements of fantasy to make the other world look legitimate. Similarly, there\u2019s a creatures that show their menacing presence while establishing dominance in their world.\\n\\n\r\nAn interesting idea about the show also comes from the political affairs of the story. In the second half of GATE, we get politics as there\u2019s some strong indication that not everyone is in favor of the \u201cspecial region\u201d idea. So in essence, the show plays its part with conflicting affairs that argues about political principles. The show also has some sense of nationalism although is vaguely portrayed and restrained to Japan, as other countries are pursuing their own interest. To say the least, GATE knows its principles and invests time to show ideologies from various parties.\\n\\n\r\nOn a more military aspect, I think the show is also aware of its modern technological capabilities. The military reveals a strong degree of realism with its arsenal of weapons throughout the show. We have aircraft such as the Kawasaki OH-1, AH-1 Cobra, and other artillery that makes its presence well known. Soldiers (known to some in the fantasy world as \u201cGreen Men\u201d) also demonstrate their degree of professionalism and ethnics. While the series isn\u2019t entirely built about military, it certainly has an appeal to this side. I will also say that GATE\u2019s author did a fairly decent job at demonstrating the firepower and capabilities of the JSDF\u2019s military. The battles have cinematic sequences and is well animated on most parts especially during mid-season.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the show has lighthearted comedy from all sorts of angles, it also should be realized that its intentions isn\u2019t a parody. Sure, the series makes a bit of fun at otaku culture such as Itami\u2019s knowledge or the character designs of the main girls. However, there\u2019s legitimacy with the war. The first episode easily establishes that JSDF is serious about their counterattack. Furthermore, Itami knows the stakes of war as lives are lost. Unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t capture all the violence and more mature content of the original story. Certain contents are omitted from TV that are deemed controversial and violent. Fan service is also shortened although still exists in a few forms such as with Rory\u2019s teasing and the bath scenes. However, the adaptation does expand on certain parts of the story, especially with events from the manga. \\n\\n\r\nImpressively, A-1 Pictures actually manages to capture the art style of the story. Their work can be a bit of hit or miss in terms of fantasy shows but I do give them some praise for adapting GATE. The character designs of characters from both the real world and fantasy world evokes interest. Military technology looks and feels real with their modern looks. Japan also has a good degree of realism with its modern cities and technology. From the fantasy world, the main female characters are distinctive with their design ranging from Rory\u2019s goth dress to Pina\u2019s medieval style battle gear. And like I mentioned before, the world fiction of GATE stands out as a fantastic feature with what is shown. To further enhance the experience, we get epic battles that almost always reveal the potential of certain characters and weapons. \\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is powerful but not the type of mind-blowing you may expect. The OP and ED theme song has a catchy tone to it with a modest style of storytelling. What makes GATE perhaps more noticeable is the dialogues that are spoken with sharp tones. And by sharp, I mean the type that clearly defines what kind of characters\u2019 personalities are capable of. Rory\u2019s sarcastic and curious voice is perhaps one of the most noticeable while Pina\u2019s voice shows a sense of her patriotism. On most parts, the OST works well enough to match the intense atmosphere of the action and lighthearted moments. \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes down to it, GATE is a show that opens a gate with wealth of interests. There\u2019s the certain \u201cit\u201d factor that makes this show stand out with both sides of the world. It blurs between the lines of fiction and reality with what it has to offer. And to be quite honest, GATE does it quite well on most parts with its creativity. This show is definitely not one that matches anyone\u2019s tastes though. Certain audiences such as those interested in political or military affairs may find this more enjoyable than others. For action junkies, GATE can appeal to that side as well although it\u2019s not a main investment of the story. When it comes to characters, there\u2019s a colorful range of them and by the end of the season, there\u2019s likely one or more that you may like to find out more. The first season is set as 12 episodes but many of the ideas and concepts opens up potentially for more.",

            "content": "GATE is a story about the pursuit of peace, a brave tale about setting our differences aside and to work for the common good. That common good is the Japanese military and cute girls, which are the greatest pillars of holiness that humanity has to offer. By pitting modern day Japan against a medieval fantasy-setting, GATE manages to contrast two incredibly different worlds with each other, showing how peace can be achieved by ignoring all complex questions. Just relax, turn off your brain, and worship the power of cute girls.\r\nSPOILERS\r\nLet\u2019s compare how religion works in the two worlds. The god(s) that we know are usuallysilent, leaving us with highly complex spiritual lives, inner lives that require us to think about our morals and to question our faith at times. In the fantasy world we have a goth-lolita, a demigod who is immortal and blessed with regeneration that won\u2019t allow her to die. Worshipping war and darkness has given her literal super-powers. If our gods took such physical manifestations, how would our society look today? If these demigods came to our world and saw how our religions impact our lives, how would they react? All of these questions are skillfully evaded by the fact that the goth-lolita is very old yet looks like a child, making her excellent fap-material devoid of any deeper meaning.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s also examine how GATE teaches us to deal with culture-shocks, and how to deal with such a multifaceted subject. Our main character is an otaku, which usually carries a bit of a social stigma. Otakus can however also be considered nerds, people who love to immerse themselves in certain subjects, be it science, history, or fiction. No doubt an otaku who loves fantasy would be ideal to send to a fantasy-world. Their genuine interest in the land\u2019s complex history and customs would be valuable for the sake of embracing our differences. The protagonist however quickly finds his true calling, in the form of a big cast of beautiful girls that he must protect. Truly, when it comes to appreciating other cultures and countries, what else is more important than looking at how beautiful the women are?\\n\\n\r\nNever fear, the other side also encounters culture shocks. A female knight visits Japan, and we learn that she wishes to completely embrace Japanese culture. You might wonder what made it possible for a medieval knight to love our world so much, and the answer is yaoi. When she sees some gay porn, she realizes what true art is. In fact, when she has to go to an ordinary library and see classic Greek sculptures and pieces of our history, she comes back exhausted and bored with life. This illustrates that learning about history and different customs is not the true path to understanding, all we ever needed to find true peace was porn. GATE is in many ways ahead of its time, showing how someone from a medieval European-inspired culture can immediately accept yaoi manga. By never even mentioning how homosexuality is looked upon in her world, we also see how insignificant discussions about sexuality is in this show about contrasting worlds.\\n\\n\r\nThe most masterful moment of avoiding conflict is when several of the otherworldly cute girls are about to exit Japan. The story reminds the viewer of the memorial dedicated to everyone who died during the first attack when the portal was opened. Naturally, since the ambassadors of the people that slaughtered so many are cute girls, everyone just cheers for them. Why would anyone be upset over the death of their loved ones? Clearly terrorist-organizations of today could have gained fan-clubs if they simply were more attractive.\\n\\n\r\nIn all honesty though, GATE is a harmless show with good animation and sound, but it\u2019s also a series that gets more irritating the more one actually thinks back on it. It likes to meander, stopping to pander to the otakus and prolong things with needless misunderstandings, which is most apparent in the last two episodes when there\u2019s a dragon just around the corner, yet nothing is done to get to the point. If one can see past the tired tropes and slow pacing in the latter half, this show can count as mindless entertainment. A second season is coming, and I can only hope it improves.",

            "content": "The show opens with some loser otaku in his twenties named Itami doing his loser otaku things before a mysterious portal opens in the middle of the city, causing a bunch of fantasy soldiers to enter the real world and slaughter everyone in sight because they\u2019re dirty racist foreigners who hate Japanese despite having just met them or something. No really, that\u2019s it. We never get an explanation for why this portal even exists, let alone why these soldiers have a beef with Japan other than \u201cbecause there\u2019d be no story otherwise\u201d. Also because they wanted to show that nerdy losers can kick ass too,because it turns out that said loser otaku is actually in the military - and I never got the backlash for this by the way because we have a fujoshi in the military running a fairly popular anime blog right now, so it\u2019s not that much of a stretch.\\n\\n\r\nAfter that admittedly exciting conflict, the show proceeds to dump a whole lot of boring plot on us by deciding the best response to this act of aggression is for Japan to send their own military into the portal and weed out the foreigners before they come back to weed-whack them. And any sympathy you may feel for the country due to the \u201cinnocent slaughtering\u201d in the show\u2019s opening act will quickly dissolve when every character seems to forget about the first act long before the audience does. In fact, Itami forgot about it as soon as it was over. No, I\u2019m not exaggerating here. After all the killing that happened in front of him, he just thought about the anime event he was supposed to attend rather than helping civilians in the aftermath. You literally could have just had the otherworldly portal appear out of nowhere, send the military in for no good reason other than \u201chuman curiosity\u201d, and it would have made no difference to the story. For a fictional product centered on soldiers, death is really cheap in Gate.\\n\\n\r\nAnd by god does it get even cheaper as it goes on, with a good helping of one-sidedness to go along with it. Most of the battles that happen in this anime have very little purpose other than to show how outclassed magic and dragons are compared to machine guns and tanks, and whenever a powerful fantasy creature who can go toe-to-toe with the military does show up, they\u2019re always on the protagonists\u2019 side so there\u2019s no tension to follow our heroes. Itami\u2019s group literally gains three fan-pandering fantasy \u201canime\u201d girls within the span of a single episode, and one of them is a demi-god who is immortal, far superior in terms of fighting prowess to everyone else to the point that she resembles a cheat code, and joins because the plot says so - along with the fact that it wouldn\u2019t be a light novel adaptation if we didn\u2019t have physically fit females falling in love with clueless male leads. They didn\u2019t even try to explain anything regarding why she finds him or helping the Japanese interesting. It\u2019s just a masturbatory power fantasy that gets in the way of the plausibility and the excitement of the scenario.\\n\\n\r\nAnd this may just be me, but am I the only one who thinks \"Japanese Adam Sandler\" whenver Itami is on-screen? I know most light novel anime feel like they were produced by Happy Madison, but Itami in particular really comes off to me like someone who'd be played by Sandler in the live-action Hollywood adaptation. The show just can't seem to decide whether or not they want to portray him as a bumbling loser or a heroic badass, so one minute he's a highly trained advanced special forces guy who's undergone rigorous training and the next minute he's getting pussy-whipped by princesses who always assume the worst. This unlikely scenario is brought to attention by some of the characters, but the show never gives a good reason for it, and he's not even put in situations where his special training would be of any use, so he might as well not have it.\\n\\n\r\nLiterally, the only reason he's the focus character is because the show needed a male protagonist to suck dick on since it'd have no idea how to progress anything otherwise. Gate has the usual light novel problem of going from act to act without much of a clear end goal in mind, and thus the only way to proceed is to put our leads in situations where they make things happen without undergoing any personal arcs of their own in the process. A small town is raided by bandits for the sole purpose of having the military show off their superior strength without suffering any losses on their side. Soldiers from other countries are massacred by the demi-god girl just to show how deus ex she is whilst also carrying the usual anti-American themes we've come to expect from most anime that involve government in one way or another. There's this court debate involving the elf girl that I can't be bothered to describe. And assuming you can get past the Japanese nationalism in all those scenarios, most of the credit for everything good always seems to go to Itami and no one else, even though all he did was get important women to fall for his charms.\\n\\n\r\nAre you seriously telling me that no other military unit accomplished anything significant in some other part of this world, let alone did more than this dude? No one else bothered to learn the fantasy peoples' language at all? I mean Japan eventually claims part of the other world as its own territory and instills its own customs on the local residents with no backlash whatsoever unless you count the occasional bandit, and yet only Itami can help out when a woman seeks \"the green people\" in order to hunt down a dragon? At least put him in scenarios where he actually has to work for his respect if you're going to go that far in rewarding him.\\n\\n\r\nBut of course, whilst I could go on and on regarding these issues, the truth of the matter is that Gate's scenario writing is so fatally flawed that you could have made James Bond the main character and it wouldn't have upped the quality to any significant degree. Its \"evil\" end goals regarding the Japanese military and the obnoxious fan-wanking are just supplementary reasons to hate it compared to how unimportant and phoned-in everything plays out due to a lack of a convincing reason to care for the conflict, along with a lack of a compelling antagonistic force. If anything, they at least add flavor to pay attention to, even if it's for the wrong reasons. I mean what's left if you strip that all away? A really bland product with no clear sense of progression, no clear end goal, no tension, and ridiculous-looking animation that isn't very exciting to the eye.\\n\\n\r\nEven its fucking sequel hook is just to setup a random adventure that has virtually no bearing on the conflict between modern and magic. I guess I can credit it for being honest with the audience that there's nothing to look forward to come next Winter, but why don't you go the extra mile, A-1, and put up a disclaimer whilst you're at it?",

            "content": "This is one of the worst anime I've ever seen. \r\n(And I've seen a lot)\r\nIf this was some cheap production, with recycled scenes, it'd be easy to see why it's bad. After all, \"look! They reused the same animation for the umpteenth time!\"\r\nBut that's not why GATE is bad. Gate is bad because of really, really terrible story. The plot is horrible and the characters worse. \r\nThe plot is essentially: A stargate like portal to another world opens in downtown Tokyo. A hoard of a marauding medieval army and monsters comes out and starts attacking civilians. \r\nBut! The Japanese Self Defense Force steps in tosave the day! Then they launch an invasion of the other side of the gate, and set up a full military base there, and begin to basically occupy and slaughter hundreds of thousands of iron age level people. \\n\\n\r\nWhat makes this horrible is is not just that GATE is a completely one-sided massacre. It's that the JSDF is celebrated as these great people with wonderful personalities who switch effortlessly between mass killing and affable, likeable people at a moment's notice. \\n\\n\r\nThen, to top it all off, their invasion is shown to be celebrated by some of the local people. \\n\\n\r\nThe whole thing feels profane. There's one scene where you are shown in this pristine, undisturbed ecosystem that fighter jets have been brought into this other world, and while people are riding around on horseback, the JSDF is flying practice maneuvers overhead. \\n\\n\r\nThere's even a scene in one episode where they mimic the \"Ride of the Valkyries\" scene from Apocalypse Now, complete with music blaring from the helicopters as the JSDF essentially murders masses of people with the sheer one-sided slaughter, just mowing them down. \\n\\n\r\nThe entire anime, is essentially unabashed Japanese military propaganda. \\n\r\nBut whereas most military propaganda, likes to portray troops as hero's and rescuers, this show portrays the JSDF as unabashed mass murderers who are perfectly okay, and completely unfazed with mass one-sided slaughter. \\n\\n\r\nIt's like watching an army recruitment commercial, only one that after showing the troops spilling out of the landing craft, with patriotic music, then shows them lining up 2000 people and executing them on site, and then afterwards laughing and smiling, while the patriotic music still plays. \\n\\n\r\nIt's sickening. And completely absurd. And the characters are just as shallow. They have no morals, feel no sense of wrong about what they are doing, just continue to follow orders and act like what they are doing is a-ok. \\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't be surprised if the production itself was backed by money from the JSDF. It's pretty unabashed propaganda. \\n\\n\r\nBut what makes this really horrible to watch, is how unashamed they are at the horrible things they are doing, and how it's portrayed as completely normal with no sense of irony. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound design is pretty poor, the characters are poor, the plot is terrible. The animation? It's not bad, but most of it is simply showing off guns and military vehicles so is essentially gun otaku porn. \\n\\n\r\nI kept watching, hoping it might get better, and that the glorification of one-sided mass killing was really supposed to be flipped around at some point and show the JSDF as the bad guys they really are in this anime. Nope. It just keeps acting like they are the good guys, in the most absurd way. \\n\\n\r\nVery creepy, and extremely unintelligent, shallow, and hollow show with one-sided characters, and very obviously being Japanese Military propaganda.\\n\\n\r\n\"Look! We don't just slaughter people, we laugh and have a beer afterwards too!\"\\n\\n",

            "content": "This show has so much potential, so while I did enjoy it (perhaps simply because there are not much similarly-themed anime to compare with) don't expect too much from this harem comedy anime. Quick review below:\r\nSTORY = 6/10\r\nWhile having so much to offer, sadly GATE resorts to generic comedy harem theme every time it hints serious development to the main plot. I mean, we rarely have a chance to explore a situation where modern world clashes with fantasy world, and everytime I expect a progress after those \"serious scene\", all i get are filler-like episodes that took main plot almost nowhere. By the time Ifinished this series, I still have no idea WHY the empire attacks Japan (an otherworld they know nothing about), HOW they build the dimensional GATE - IF they build it at all.\\n\\n\r\n+ Genuine, refreshing idea\\n\r\n- Wasted its potential despite serious atmosphere hinted in early episodes\\n\r\n- Some plotholes and illogical actions taken by the power players that I cannot discuss without spoilers\\n\\n\r\nART = 6/10\\n\\n\r\n+ Main points goes to detailed render of war vehicles & weapons\\n\r\n- Char and background are so-so, and it's pretty weird if you notice how the male and female eyes are in very different style, i mean i can understand if it was used intentionally to highlight the difference of real and fantasy world, but that is obviously not the case.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND = 7/10\\n\\n\r\nSimilar to art, main points goes to detailed modern warfare sounds : engines, gunshots, etc. OP is pretty generic and ED is less than mediocre. Not that it matters much. Seiyuus did their job perfectly for characters they represent, but then again this is a standard we should expect from today's anime , so.. what else can i say?\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER = 4/10\\n\\n\r\nMain screen time are spent on these main protagonists: Itami, Rory, Lelei, Pina Co Lada (in order of appearance), each represents a stereotypical harem casts in a slightly diferrent, original seting. It means they base their actions on harem logic. WISH I KNEW IT FROM THE START. That way i can prepare my mind by setting my expectation as low as possible.\\n\\n\r\nWait, what is harem logic? Let me illustrate by a few samples without spoiling it too much :\\n\\n\r\n- Instead of asking the enemy \"why did you attack us\", or asking ANYONE that might have the answers.. you hang around with her and her harem army to get into harem situations as much as you could.\\n\\n\r\n- Almost every main girls the main protagonist met succumb to his \"charm\" , by default or nice coincidence, whichever is more convenient. Also, the story at some point completely disregards plot logic and progress it has built.. to get main protagonist into harem situations. Again.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the other side characters.. they don't have much screen time. Even if a few of them have any, it's because they happened to be together with those main casts I mentioned above - and are used as \"dolls\" to complement whatever Itami's doing.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT 6 / 10\\n\\n\r\nReflecting on how GATE treats the gate as a tool to build a comedy harem situations around it, instead of exploring its full potential and develop realistic / serious plot using up-to-date \"modern warfare\" know-how (yes it was being hinted in a few conversations, but they never develop it), I hereby judge GATE as \"guilty pleasure\" anime of this year\\n\\n\r\n.. the pleasure mainly comes from a few action worthy moments & serious/ logical conversations in the first 2 episodes, which steadily drop as the series progress. I give it a 6 anyway, considering that some people may still enjoy it by adjusting their expectation or just because they like comedy harem theme.",

            "content": "Gate is propaganda, and based on how high it scores here it's damn effective but as an anime series it fails on the most basic of principles and just isn't any good once you realize it was built solely around being pro-military media fodder.\r\nSo let's break this down into the grading criteria itself: \r\nStory: 3/10 \r\nGate's surprisingly strong opening and base concept is the only reason I didn't rate it any lower as in the right hands they could have been the building blocks for a genuinely good show.  \r\nShortly after the JSDF enters the titular gate things take a turn for the worseand the originally unique and interesting concept of an otaku turned local hero being forced to serve his country in a high fantasy setting who's ruling country had previously attacked Japan turns into generic otaku harem fodder all to sell a 100% pro-militaristic, pro-Japanese message. \\n\\n\r\nEven barring how annoyingly obvious the propaganda is it's a failing in story telling as our main characters stumble through situations that are generally resolved one of two ways:\\n\\n\r\n1. Japan/Pro Japanese characters win because they are 100% good and right all the time (See: Propaganda) \\n\\n\r\n2. The even more annoying: Time skips that show none of the resolution and we are told through literal dialogue breaking the most fundamental of writing rules: Show don't tell. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot get's weak quickly, though attempting to add a level of court intrigue and political drama it is mired down in it's inability to make the issues subtle or nuanced as it paints literally every other country, either fictional or real, as bad guys to the bone. Even going so far as casting the US as a country intent on kidnapping members of the main cast for no reason beyond it makes Japan look better by comparison. \\n\\n\r\nMost the world mechanics inside the gate are glossed over or never addressed, there is literally no world building. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe best part of this show by a landslide Gate is undeniably pleasing to look at, the style breaks slightly from the current popular style with the people beyond the gate having a distinct look to them compared to those of modern day Japan. \\n\\n\r\nThe people beyond the gate are the most visually interesting though not always in a good way. Their outlines are thicker, instead of clean tonal shading there are shading lines reminiscent of manga and western comics. Their eyes are drawn in a distinctly different style, or at least they are if they are female. \\n\r\nIt's the men of the gate who tend to look a lot worse than their female characters. \\n\\n\r\nIt should be noted that Itami and his team are not ugly by any means, though design wise the male members of the team while distinguishable from each other are not as interesting as the two girls on his team. That is a running theme throughout the show with the female characters being more interesting visually to appeal to the otaku crowd. \\n\\n\r\nThe backgrounds are basic pastel pretty but uninteresting fare, however the Japanese's military equipment is oddly and jarringly gorgeous. Several scenes feature nothing more than military porn, which I have a feeling are the reason the story time skips from time to time, gotta make time for gorgeously animated helicopters, tanks and troops in them. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10 \\n\\n\r\nPretty basic fare here, nothing is amiss here scene wise but the soundtrack will likely only be decorating the shelves of those who are fanatics for the show it's music is wholly forgettable though the guns are satisfying in their clicking and rattling. The opening song while catchy is nearly identical to that of the second season and indeed anything else that band has produced. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 3/10 \\n\\n\r\nGate's other biggest failing. Itami is interesting at first but after entering the gate he stagnates and refuses to develop, he never suffers from real struggles and when faced with dilemmas pulls the most stupid solutions out of his ass that just somehow, breaking all logic, work out. His character goes from reluctant hero otaku to idiot wearing a military uniform. \\n\r\nAnd no one calls him out on his horrible decision making processes. \\n\\n\r\nThe girls while cute and basically different from each other are boring at best. There's the quiet and studious but powerful one, the sexually liberated one, the broken but alluring one who will probably end up with Itami if any one member of his harem becomes a steady love interest. That's a creepy trope by the way, and it only gets worse in the second season but that's another discussion for another time.\\n\\n\r\nOh and who can forget the totally unique and not a prebuilt, no effort required, cliche headstrong, Tsundere, strong in a fight but naive to the real workings of the world princess with (red) pink hair. That was sarcasm by the way, Pina is the most color by the numbers member of the cast and unfortunately the one with the most actual personalty. \\n\\n\r\nItami's actual military team is forgettable, it's male characters blending together and it's female characters one note characters who are quickly sidelined by Itami's new harem. \\n\\n\r\nAny interesting characters are not part of the main cast and forget so quickly by the narrative that I can't even remember their names despite wishing the show was about them instead because they'd be less boring. \\n\\n\r\nThe antagonists are one note, hating on the JSDF simply because it makes for better propaganda and either are killed or humiliated into submission or join the Japanese side for no reason at all. \\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal thoughts: \\n\\n\r\nOn the surface this is an okay if not somewhat enjoyable show but once you think about it, Gate fails. It's mindless otaku fodder and if that's what your watching it for then go for it but if you're looking for something less intellectually insulting and with more substance skip this. \\n\\n\r\nThe pretty art style and cute girls are a trap.",

            "content": "----------SPOILER FREE--------------\r\nTL;DR below for the lazy ones ;)\r\nEver wondered what's it like when an ancient army clashes with modern military? GATE is unique in the way that it presents to us a variety of idea; the clash of armies, the blending of cultures, the true melting pot of Anime.\r\nDo you love Fantasy? Action? Captivating music? Well-crafted and diverse characters?\r\nIf you said \"Yes\" to any of these questions, this gem of an anime is one that you should DEFINITELY catch. (If you said yes to all, you won't fail to orgasm every episode)\r\nMoving on~\r\nStory: 9\r\nThe potential in the concept itself already warrants an 8.\r\nHowever, potential aloneis nothing.\\n\r\nDelicate execution and engaging plot propels this to a solid 9, further supported by the intensity of the developments that leave you begging for more.\\n\r\nDespite the Fantasy theme, GATE attempts inject Reality back into the plot as well. The focus of the show is occasionally shifted back from the\"Special Region\" to Japan, and sequences that occur back in Japan can affect the main plot happening beyond the Gate, adding to the realism of this series. \\n\\n\r\nWhile there are arguably certain flaws in the plot, they shouldn't stop you from enjoying the show at all. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nWhile the art isn't exactly magnificent, it's far from bad.\\n\r\nJust don't expect it to be at Kotonoha no Niwa standard.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the animation (which is fine, really), the characters are really well illustrated (up close) and the vehicles of the JSDF (Eg helicopter, trucks) were well drawn and very detailed.\\n\\n\r\nThe only fault in the art is that the backgrounds were not taken care of properly. Eg if a character was in the background of a certain scene, details could be missing from her in general.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nBoth the OP and ED were beautiful. \\n\r\nOSTs as realistic as they could get: the gunshots, clashing of swords, the helicopters; an experience that shouldn't be missed.\\n\r\nThe Seiyuus were amazing too! (Especially Rory's one)\\n\r\nEvery time I hear her moan I moan as well (It's normal I swear!; Watch it and see for yourself)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\nOften said to be the most attractive aspect of this show: The Characters\\n\r\nMain Character Itami Youji is an otaku (and First Lieutenant) that most of us can associate with. He's funny and surprisingly caring, a character whom you will absolutely love. Having an MC that viewers can understand, relate to and empathise with is evidence of a great Anime.\\n\\n\r\nLelei is a smart 15 year old sorceress apprentice that has taken a particular interest in the Japanese language, often acting as a translator for the Japanese soldiers. Her curiosity and cuteness just makes her a lovable character in the series.\\n\\n\r\nTuka Luna is a elf teen (that isn't as young as she looks) that lost her family and ends up in the care of the JSDF.\\n\\n\r\nLast and definitely not least, Rory Mercury is a (horny) gothic loli demigod that carries around a giant halberd. Her alluring voice and tantalizing demeanor makes you wish that the one she was teasing was you. Yet, she can be unusually deep at times. (If you know what I mean ;)\\n\r\nOf course, there are many other notable characters that all have their own good points, but for the purpose of the review I won't be mentioning all.\\n\\n\r\nWhat constitutes aesthetics? What is true aesthetics? Philosophers can debate for years on the true manifestation of aestheticism. Is it Art? Is it Music? Little do they know that the answer lies in an Anime TV series. A series called GATE. The true embodiment of aesthetics is in characterisation.\\n\\n\r\nOverall/Enjoyment: 9\\n\r\nSadly, the next 3-4 months is going to be a period of hardship that I will gladly endure; the wait for Season 2!\\n\\n\r\nThere are so many reasons why I just love this series; the Fate references during the Special Forces mission, the Ride of the Valkyries Helicopter scene;\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR? Gate presents an unprecedented concept to the fantasy genre. If you enjoy shows like NGNL, SAO, Overlord, or fantasy in general, then this is a show that you will certainly adore. Thank me later :)",

Afterwards we are told that a gate leading to a magic world appeared in Japan and the JSDF is sent in, and etc. (which you can just see the anime to learn about)\\n\\n\r\nBack to ranting about wasted potential. Why was the military sent in like that? Aren't the JSDF about defending Japanese territory not invading someone elses? Where are all the other countries armies? You would think that the knowledge that another world exist would send the world into a frenzy with every country scrambling to get in, but nope only japan goes. (And have any succeed with the locals but this part is spoiler for the anime) Seeing this basically convinced me that the author is jerking off to his otaku patriotism at this point.\\n\\n\r\nAnd through the gate we reach a generic fantasy world which is even more obvious pandering. I mean loli-gothic-catgirl(?)-wielding a halberd who is attracted to the MC and turned on by killing? Big tities blonde elf? When you have seen a lot of fantasy you know this is elementary stuff that is overused every where, for once I would like to see a fantasy world that is more fantasy, something like Monster hunter, giant mountain like monsters, creepy forest that suck out your soul, terrible extradimensional diseases that turns people into abomination. You know the kind of stuff you expect military man to face in a hostile unknown world and die by droves as mankind struggle with both the benefit and terrible cost of accessing an unknown world.\\n\\n\r\nBut that would make too good of a story, instead of that have some more none PTSD soldier MC having hijinks with hot fantasy waifu. There are some actions, the helicopter bits were good, and there were some good military tactics and things. But it could have been so much MORE, having soldiers as a MC is suppose to take us out of the otaku comfort zone and show some real hardcore things, like killing alien abominations, tragic lose of human lives during wars, people unable to get over their PTSD as memories of their died comrades hunt them for decades of their life, and scientists around the world using knowledge from this new world to make discoveries that are both beneficial and terrible. World in a frenzy as countries tear each other to shreds to get a piece of the pie or to get as far away as possible.\\n\\n\r\nBut nope, it is the same old pandering thing, I mean we have an otaku MC, waifus, \"JSDF is never wrong\" mentality, light-hearted fun mixed with pointless edgy (which have no effect on our MC's mentality). This is an author jerking off to his patriotism and fetishes and I'm so sick of it!\\n\\n\r\nGo watch log horizon or western media if you want to watch a better clash of culture.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 7\\n\r\nClean, it is okay, nothing bad, but nothing awe-inspiring either, but that is just what A-1 is like.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8\\n\r\nOkay, but it doesn't make the show any more suffer able.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 2\\n\r\nEvery second I spend on this show was a reminder that Japan couldn't get its sh*t together and how the medium is pandering more and more to the lowest denominator. With the tide of adaptation moving more and more to the WN shows like Overlord and Gate, I fear for the future of anime that is going down the toilet right now.\\n\\n\r\nNow I'm going to play Witcher and Touhou for a while to wash this bad taste of fantasy from my mouth.",

I really enjoyed this anime. \r\nStory:\r\ni always wanted to see a story like this whether it be anime or not. a story where a medieval time like world comes across the present time in war. The story is very straight forward. It's no the same as Oda Nobuna no Yabou or Outbreak Company, but if you enjoyed either of them you will find this one interesting. \r\nCharacter:\r\nI really like how the characters are presented. Simply said all the main characters are badass in their own way. \r\nSound: \r\nThe SFX is good. i actually found this anime while listening to one of favoriteclassical songs (if you watch it you will know which song i am talking about). The sounds doing the action scenes are not bad. They have some detail put into them so you can hear the difference between the guns.",

            "content": "I, for one, was drawn into the intriguing world that Gate drops us in, but the real question is what else does Gate manage to do besides having an interesting premise?\r\nThe premise and the mystery surrounding the so called \"Special Realm\" are the strongest points of the show by far, however the execution felt a little lacking in the story department. The battle scenes show how ridiculously one sided this war is between the two realms, which detracts from the suspense of the story as the outcome of any battle is never in doubt. Coupled by the fact that one of the protagonist is literaryinvincible make the SDF and their friends virtually unbeatable.\\n\r\n Despite this, the moments showcasing the might of the SDF still manage to be engaging as it really made me think of the morality of the war, or rather, the slaughter that takes place. Also the rampant nationalism gets old real quick in this show, as Japan is the best at everything, everything they make is amazing, basically all I can picture is Japanese Big Brother nodding in approval after seeing how the might of Japan is mentioned once again. Another point of annoyance for myself were the constant mentioning to otaku, and how it felt at times that moments had been crafted to fulfill some otaku fantasy checklist rather than advance the plot. At times it felt like the creator was thinking more along these lines: I know you like cat girls, so here's one and a bunch of fanservice to go with it, and just to sweeten the deal, here's a bath scene, you can thank me later, you otaku you. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot isn't really anything to call home about, but gets the job done and sets up some questions about the realm from both sides, and kind of surprisingly focuses on the political aspect of the situation from both sides. As I mentioned before at times it certainly heads down the path of the cliche , but at the same time does manage to patch in some engaging actions scenes at the same time, as well as humor from time to time. Nice guy Itami is the typical male lead who only works to supplement his otaku tendencies, and at times it feels like his character and his skill are just a little too convenient for someone of his background. Most of the other characters are pretty much husks, besides Rory who provides some of the more interesting moments, but also hinders some moments due to her immense power. I found that one character introduced later in the series really added a lot of depth to Itami and his character, but unfortunately she only stuck around for  a short time. \\n\r\nI found the music to fit in well with the action scenes and the series, and think that the OP of the series really stands out. The art is visually pleasing as well, I can't even complain about the CGI, which is used minimally and fits in without being too intrusive.\\n\r\nOverall, Gate has a strong concept that will initially get you hooked, but the pieces of the story aren't nearly as strong as its premise, and I felt that at times the narrative fell into some of the usual anime cliches. The constant mentioning of the Japan's might and otaku culture also result in some weird alienating moments from the narrative, taking me out of the immersive world. I would say that Gate is definitely worth checking out, but if the world itself is not able to keep you occupied than you may find yourself tuning out earlier than expected.",

            "content": "When I was young(er), my favorite day dream was time travel. The exploits of my journey are outlined as follows: A) Time travel to a feudal era of crude weaponry. B) Bring automatic weapons/explosives. C) Wipe out a nation's army. D) Plunder hot women and treasures. \r\nC\u2019mon guys, don\u2019t act like this dream hasn\u2019t crossed your minds?! ARMY OF DARKNESS \u2013movie plug! If this scenario tickles your fancy/fetish, then GATE just might be the anime for you.\r\nStory: 7. Perhaps imaginative is singularly the best word to describe GATE. The story is basically about a time/space traveling gate that links two worlds together \u2013 a fantasticalfeudal world with elves, demigods, dragons, and wizards, and modern day Japan and their interactions. Extremely helpful is the succinct recap that precedes most episodes. Story is also very pro-Japan, as if it were the epicenter of the universe. Even made the US look like bumbling clowns at times :). Enough of the overview.\\n\\n\r\nOne major gripe: more action! I repeat, I demand DOMINATION! In all seriousness, the first couple episodes were satisfying to watch modern technology go tet-a-tet with swords and spears. Oh man, thousands of people mowed down in an instant with superior weaponry*cue evil grin*. In one memorable scene, combat helicopters laid the smack down and decimated shield bearing knights. MUHAHHAAH! That\u2019s my kind of fan-service! Alas, mid-series, the warfare settles down and the impetus of the narrative focuses on the \u201cother-world foreigners\u201d being acquainted with modern Japanese culture and vice-versa. I must admit, it was sorta fascinating to live vicariously through the eyes of a pre-modern person. The first subway ride, the first fast food, the first clothes shopping experience\u2026 But wasn't this supposed to be a gun show?\\n\\n\r\nSecond major gripe: there isn\u2019t one identifiable climax, and the denouement is WAY too long. I feel like the anime could have easily ended at episode 10. The last 2 episodes, excuse my french, were BORING. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7. You\u2019re typical garden-variety animation. I think the most memorable artwork revolves around Rory Mercury\u2019s action sequences. My love, Rory! She is not only Waifu material, but sick nasty in combat. That Lolita-gothic theme brings all the boyz to yard! The attention to detail on the Hummers, tanks, and helicopters are noted as well. Sadly, other action sequences were not as thoughtfully realized. Some sequences were merely static pictures that violently shook and had people screaming. Can we say 80\u2019s anime? Budget-cutz. Overall, art was acceptable.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 7. Typical fare music, meaning that it neither got in the away of the story or was outstanding. I usually always skip the beginning and ending music sequences.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7. Rory Mercury! My Waifu 4 Life-fu! Okay, I\u2019ll stop. Characters are flat, 2D and static. Anime is much more plot driven than character driven. Not a bad thing for an action/adventure anime. Most character were not as engaging, except my true love Rory!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8. Did anyone mention that GATE is funny?  For instance, a fansub translated a phrase, \u201cThe invading army fires explosives that look like giant iron cocks!\u201d Hilarious. A queen called Pina Co Lada? I rest my case. While the MAL genre tag of action, adv, fantasy, military is absolutely correct, I\u2019d say this is equally comical. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, while GATE isn\u2019t high on my rewatchable list, it was mindless fun. Actually, real fun. If you need to decompress and watch a relatively clean anime with some genuine humor and imagination, this just might be the anime for you.\\n",

            "content": "Modern VS Ancient Fantasy warfare? I don't know about you but that sounded mighty appealing to me. So I was delighted the moment my friend recommended Gate: Jieitai Kanochi nite, Kaku Tatakaeri. \r\nStory: Clashing modern warfare vs an ancient one (with bits of fantasy elements in them) is the main point of this anime. Modern Japan being attacked by all sort of monsters and magicked creatures form another realm was what they first presented. One would expect a very long and bloody back and forth rally between the two factions as most war related titles are, but how this anime deviated from that cliche isone of the series' charm. Anyone who has a love for war themed titles will love this for its unique and realistic approach.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art isn't what I would call awe inspiring but it isn't bad either. The overall is just average, but what I like about this anime are the designs and the thought that's been put to them. That means no outrageous appearances for the normal humans while the Special Region characters are well designed. from the human race to the dragons. And lets not forget about the non living parts of the anime. The world at the Special Region was well designed, as well as the war machines. Tanks, choppers, guns. Name them.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound is one of the nicest points of the anime. They've got a quite well rounded seiyuu roster, each perfectly brings out the characters colors. The OP theme is suited for the anime's exciting feel (totally unrelated but fun tip: If you want a more intense feel, play the opening video of this anime and mute the sound, playing SNK's opening Guren no Yumiya instead. IT FITS!) and the ED theme sounds really lighthearted and I think it suits the other side of the series. The effects are not lacking, what with all the gunshots and bombs and everything else that's been used. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Now comes my favorite part. Characters are always important to me whenever I watch anything. You can give me a total let down with good, relatable characters and I will enjoy it. For this series though, I am very please with almost everyone. I'm not really into harem types so I was quite wary of what the character might be like before I started watching this, but to my surprise, Itami is a very realistic character. Easy going, lazy otaku who is actually a very fine soldier. Some might think that this is cliche, but how Itami faces everything is very refreshing. Then you have your mighty Goddess type gothic lolita, a smart, cool mage, a coping elf, and a feisty but worrisome princess. Everyone has got a lot of potential and I'm more pleased to say that they're not annoying. The supporting characters are also intriguing enough not to be set aside. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I first watched this series expecting a lot of deaths and angst and all those dark stuffs (which I really like) and one might think that I must be disappointed as this series is not any of those, but nope. This is one of my most enjoyed animes for the year so far. Realistic in its approach without being a drag. My only con point here is that it is too short. As I've mentioned, the series has many good points, including its wide array of interesting characters and the limited episodes doesn't do much justice to that. It's good that it has a confirmed new season for next year and I'm definitely looking out for that one. \\n",

            "content": "Finally! An anime series with modern military that I can actually call good because it is very hard to find a great modern military anime this days. Plus, it's a modern military vs medieval army so that's an added bonus considering the fact that I'm a fan of both sides. \r\n[Story]: (8/10)\r\nIn August of 20XX, a portal to a parallel world, known as the \"Gate\" suddenly appeared in Ginza, Tokyo. Monsters and troops poured out of the portal, turning the shopping district into a bloody inferno. The JGSDF (Japan Ground-Self Defence Force) took action and pushed back the creatures into the Gate. The JGSDF hasdispatched the Third Reconnaissance Team to the \"Special Region\" at the other side of the Gate. \\n\\n\r\nYou don't know how happy I am right now to finally find an anime series with modern military that actually uses tanks, jets, helicopter and artillery. Most animes today uses mechas which pisses me off because I like to see modern and historical battles. None of this fake-ass flying robots bullshit.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways..just like the synopsis, a \"Gate\" appeared out of nowhere and the military has been sent to investigate the other side. On the other side, they found out that the beings we believe as fantasy exists on the other side of the gate. Magic, mages, elves, dragons, and etc..they're there.  \\n\\n\r\nThe show is mainly focused on Itami, a 33 year old otaku who prefers his hobby than his work. He and his platoon saved a bunch of refugees along with 3 girls who is a mage, an elf and a demi-god. That's what happened on the first 3 or 4 episodes. Later on, some politics stuff happened and they even showed that the US, China and Russia are a bunch of greedy officials who would take the \"mysterious\" land for their own. How ironic.. Then more plot points appear but revealing more of the plot points will lead to spoilers.  In short, it's one problem to another that would get eventually solved by Itami's platoon or other characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe only part I didn't like about the show is the pacing.. There's a bunch of time skips in the show and the first few episodes were slightly rushed. A-1 adapted this anime so I'm not really surprised that there would be time-skips and rushed pacing. In the 2nd half of the series, the pacing does slow down so I got a break from the fast mindless action. \\n\\n\r\nI'm just a bit irritated that they decided to split the show into 2 seasons instead of a 25 episode continuous run (Yes..show ends on a cliffhanger) but if you look at shows like Akame Ga Kill and Soul Eater, you'd be glad that they decided to continue the rest of the episodes next year. I'd rather wait than get a shitty rushed original anime plot that's not even in the manga. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: (9/10)\\n\r\nIf you've seen some A-1 adapted animes before then you should be familiar with the animation at first glance. It's looks the same as their previously worked animes. The environment does look great, especially the the other world. The action scenes are very smooth. Especially the scenes were the 2 sides are fighting and the scene where Rory is fighting with her giant-ass sword. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Sound]: (9.4/10)\\n\r\nOne word...Awesome! The soundtrack used for the battle scenes are amazing, even the themes used for conversations/fooling around scenes are great. Also, the Ride of the Valkyrie scene. Oh, How I love that classic theme.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP theme song is GATE: Sore wa Akatsuki no you ni\" by Kishida Kyoudan & The Akeboshi Rockets and the ED theme song is Prism Communicate\" by Rory VA, Tuka VA, and Lelei VA. I am now in love with both the OP and ED theme song. The OP has this rock-type version accompanied with action scenes that fits the song. I love how the opening makes me want to join the JSDF. Showing off their military power and might. Ahh, propaganda at its finest. The ED is more like a cutesy song that was sung by the VA of 3 main female characters. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Character]: (9/10)\\n\r\nWhen I first read the synopsis and saw the cover, I thought that this was going to be a harem because Itami is an otaku and he is surrounded by 3 fantasy girls. Thank god, it didn't turn out that way. A harem consists of at least 3 girls who is in love with the same guy. The thing is only 2 girls have feelings for Itami. So basically, it's a love triangle but not a serious one. Anyways...\\n\\n\r\nItami is a 33 year old otaku who works for the JSDF..At the first episode, I thought Itami is going to be full of BS..I mean, how can an otaku fight like that (as demonstrated in the first episode) then you find out he's with the JSDF. That figures...Guess what, he's also a first lieutenant and he's with the goddamn Special Forces (equivalent to US Delta Force). He's an otaku and he's also a near-top military official? Yep, I official like this character. \\n\\n\r\nThen there's the 3 main female character which was saved by Itami's platoon. Lelei la Lalena is a 15 year old human (from the other world) training to be a mage. She loves books and she's a very intelligent and smart teenager. She quickly learned Japanese so she became an interpreter for the JGSDF. You know what I love about her? Her calm looks. She looks calm all the time, literally. You barely see her smiling. Tuka Marceau is a 165 year old elf who is considered a teenager in their race's standards. Something tragic happened to her before she got rescued and I don't really want to spoil it. The final main female character is Rory Mercury. She is over 900 years old and is a demi-god. I don't get how some people like her? I don't like her. Her voice is goddamn annoying and her sex noises are also irritating. I do like it when she goes out and fight using that sword of hers. \\n\\n\r\nBesides Rory, none of the characters were annoying. Hell, even Itami who I expected to be the most annoying when he's around girls is not an annoying MC. He can get a little pervy around girls sometimes but he doesn't drool all the time around those 3 girls that he saved. He also tends to be funny when he shows his otaku side. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Military and Weaponry accuracy]: (9.5/10) (This does not count towards my OVERALL rating)\\n\r\nAs a military and war fanatic, I felt like I have to review this section too.  I'm going to make this as short as possible.\\n\\n\r\nDid they portray the JSDF right? Yes, they portrayed them almost perfectly. From tactics to the guns they're using, they got it. They're using a Type-64 Assault Rifle which is not the most modern weaponry and they got that right because Japan has cut back on their military costs. They also used a Panzerfaust 3 to fight off the Red Dragon.\\n\\n\r\nWere the military vehicles and weaponry accurate? Yes..They got the Hind right which is an AH-1 Cobra which is used by the JGSDF today. They also got the choppers right which is a Huey. A chopper with gun emplacements on both sides. It is currently used by the JGSDF today. As for the tanks. They were using a Type-74 MBT which is currently used by the JGSDF today. Lastly, the jets. It was shown that they were using a F-4EJ Phantom. \\n\\n\r\nI'm impressed with the show's military and weaponry accuracy. They really did their research or the director probably had greater knowledge when it comes to JGSDF and their military. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]: (10/10)\\n\r\nThis has now become my most favorite anime of the year. I never got bored with the show and I was always on the edge of my seat. It's also nice to see that they portrayed the military almost perfectly because as a war and military fanatic, that's what I'd like to see. Not some fake-ass shit\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[OVERALL]: (9/10)\\n\r\n\"Gate: And so the Special Defense Force Fought Back\" is one of the best modern military anime I have ever seen. It also has fantasy stuff like magic, elfs, mages, etc that is sure to please the fans who likes Fantasy era. If you're a fan of military genre or the fantasy genre then you might want to give this show a try. I'm warning you though..Once you start watching the show, it will be very hard to stop watching. It's very addicting\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Story is Very Well Done\\n\r\n+Great Animation\\n\r\n+Great Soundtrack, especially the \"Ride of the Valkyrie\" theme.\\n\r\n+Great Characters\\n\r\n+Show almost perfectly portrayed the JSDF and their weaponry/military vehicles\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Pacing issues",

Many are very detailed modern approaches to how to act in foreign territory, local our mutual cooperation, the escalating use of force, all these details are present in the anime.\r\nAlso at the level of use of military material is very detailed, always wearing a bulletproof vest with collars (It seems silly, but they are very unpleasant to wear), including the disposition of weapon down during transport (avoid damage to the face in an accident) not using night vision goggles for day to avoid damaging them, the elastic strap... For me as a military is like watching peers from another country during an operation factly, beating all warlike animes I've seen so far in realism. There are also some concessions as a work of fiction, but everything is on the edge between realism and entertainment work.\\n\\n\r\nThe mix of fantasy and realism is exquisite and is a fantastic \"what if ...\"",

            "content": "Gate is a failed attempt at an anime that supposed to show how our work would react if we found a different magical dimension that we could travel to. \r\nStory: The story of Gate is 4 so I consider it decent, I find it pretty cool they show how the army would react and how a magic world would react to our worlds tech and military artillery I have to say the way they portray the magic world is awful because the only thing we know about it is how the military work and how the army works. They don't spend enough time on thetownspeople or how their culture is different from ours and i know some of you are thinking \"But they don't need to explain how the magic world works because we've already seen it a million times\" and that's where I tell you they do need to show it because the audience is looking through the perspective of the military so the military doesn't know anything about this world so it makes sense that should explain how this world works and how the townspeople act plus how different their culture is different from ours. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation: The animation is fine but it's nothing super well done since there ins't much to look at except shooting and a couple of slaps from some the girls and the walking where there is a bunch of. \\n\\n\r\nSound: The music isn't anything special is kind of boring and generic for a military type of show. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: I dislike most the girl characters because most of them are walking cliches and have no personality expect the way they adore the main character and the way they react to the military going through the gate, also they can be it into an archetype and that just sums up their character and how'll they'll be for the rest of the show. The guy characters are fine and are tolerable.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall Gate is an escapist fantasy for teenage guys to get off to animal girls in a magical world and has a poorly written story and characters that have no thought put into them",

            "content": "In france, where I live, if you ask someone to describe Japan, he or she will usually answer the following sentence : \"A country mixing tradition and modernity\".\r\nGate: Jieitai Kanochi nite, Kaku Tatakaeri tends to perfectly fit to this description. Indeed, it brings a contemporary Japan with all its armament, to travel a Gate leading to another world. As you can guess, this world is based on a fantasy Middle-age (even Antiquity I think) with a bit of magic. And the whole show was either directed by Michael Bay or written under LSD.\r\nThe whole point of this anime appears - at first - to bea great battlefield opposing our world with its tanks, assault rifles, machineguns, choppers and even fighter jets ; and soldiers wearing bronze or steel armor and having only spears or shields. Quite an unfair outcome obviously ! But what could be positive (or not, say the blood thirsty watchers) is that our humanity is mostly shown as merciful, understanding and willing to create a peace climate. I might disappoint some people but... you won't get to see a whole show of poor soldiers being slaughtered under Richard Wagner's \"Ride of the Valkyries song\".\\n\\n\r\nYes you read it correctly : they dared using this glorious (meme) military song to accompany a fight where brigands get literally blew up under attack choppers and their soldiers. I rarely watched such joyful, even orgasmic miltary anime...\\n\\n\r\nHowever, do not get distracted by the global warfare atmosphere that might appear in your head, reading my previous lines. Gate: Jieitai Kanochi nite, Kaku Tatakaeri introduces a lot of characters (one might say too many on some point and he or she would not be wrong) and many of them are catchy, attractive and pleasant to follow on their adventures. You actually get to discover many profiles, going from the classic heartwarmed soldier, the elf, the dark loli or the military superior being overwhelmed by his subordinate's low behaviour.\\n\\n\r\nThe global story line cannot be completed by season one and in fact, season starts with episode 13 instead of a complete new episode 1. I highly recommend this show for both military thema lovers and fantasy fans. And if you are none, maybe watching a fire dragon being killed by kilos of C4, Rocket launchers will catch your attention. Same goes with her kids getting shot by both fighter jets and artilery.\\n\\n\r\nEdit : after reading every chapters of the manga that concerned season 1's events, I have now a second point of view to share. Indeed, surprisingly, the anime is extremely loyal to its written parent, covering everything shown on the paper. It even added a better introduction, episode 1 covering more of Gate's first battle which was quite eluded in the manga.\\n\\n\r\nOtherwise, I think almost everything looked alike if we were to compare both versions. However I noticed season 2 received a lot of cuts contrary to the original chapters. Easy to figure out they faced a lack of available screentime, so it was obvious some tiny parts (or not so tiny) had to be removed. Anyway, if you appreciated Gate's animated version, you should get along with the written version ! It is still on 'Publishing' status by the way.",

            "content": "GATE, I could've sworn I saw this at 24 episodes and when I finished the 12th episode I could not believe what I saw. I was really let down by that, but onto the review. And I can't stress this enough, if you're an anime apologist, don't even bother reading this review or any of my reviews. If you're open minded, welcome.\r\nA gate appears OUTTA NOWHERE, and came rushing the empire's army, indiscriminately slaughtering the citizens of Japan. And now, our otaku military genius protagonist, Itami, swoops in and saves the day and meets cute fantasy girls that any anime/manga fan dreams of. There, beginsthe story of GATE. It's an interesting plot that'll have you coming back out of curiosity and quite honestly, enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nThe world beyond the gate and it's citizens aren't anything inspiring or unique, to say. It's about a fairly above average fantasy setting. But it's good that way, otherwise modern technology, being one of the key elements in the series, to be underwhelmed by unlimited magical powers. The art and animation is consistent throughout the series. It's nothing special but it proves itself to be a great effort. And I applause it for that.\\n\\n\r\nThe way the show ended, I can't find myself to say the show is anything other than just good. Not amazing, not horrendous, but good. The voice acting is good enough to keep you entertained throughout the watch. The soundtrack is okay, I never really noticed it as there were plenty of scenes that didn't actually have background music, or either that, it was too low. Additionally, the opening and ending songs are quite good. I enjoyed listening to them. As well as the opening and ending themselves, they convey what the series is about, helping others and creating peace between the two world.\\n\\n\r\nItami is yet another brown hair protagonist archetype, but unlike the rest of the shitty characters I've seen like that, Itami offers a a lot more scope and range to him. We learn that he's more than what he seems, but more subtle, and not too exaggerated that it would've killed the mood. While I don't feel like he puts up anything new to the table, he definitely is a well crafted main protagonist. And for the three girls that accompany him, Lelei is simply a young magician, Rory is a demi-god, and Tuka is an elf that lost her clan to a fire dragon. That's as deep as those characters get. For the rest of the cast like the other green people and fantasy characters, they are alright. They do their part and it moves right back to Itami and co.. It's interesting to see the fantasy characters interact with the modern world, and it shows the better parts of the three girls that follow Itami, as well as, yes, Pina Co Lada.\\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy this show? Yes, I did, but I just feel like 12 episodes and how the series left on a cliff hanger, kind of thing, weakened the show very much. I hear it's getting a season 2 but it leaves a conflict waiting to be resolved that was introduced as a sort of new arc. And that is not a good thing to do, even though I understand why not a lot of series can get a full 24 episode show right then and there, having to wait another season or two to get a continuation.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum everything up, overall, this show barely misses a recommendation and bad ass seal of approval (Angry Joe!!!). Though it wouldn't hurt to check it out if you have time but not something I will say you must watch NOW.",

            "content": "While it isn't unheard of to mix fantasy with reality, the concept of integrating two different worlds together is something entirely new. I wasn't sure what to expect of GATE given its lengthy synopsis, but it certainly delivered satisfying entertainment. The plot pays much attention the detail of military and political problems between two nations while giving the audience glimpses of life from the other world, one filled with elves, fairies, demigods, and magic. It's intriguing to observe the interaction between two different cultures that both want to know what lies on the other side of the gate. We get to see the inner workingsof battle with knights, tanks, aircraft, archers, as well as contemplate the negotiations being made between countries. There is a number of possibilities that this show can take, and it was cool to see how everything developed.\\n\\n\r\nThough my previous paragraph described a whole lot of elements in the story, I don't believe the plot became very exciting until the third episode. There were a lot of preparations made for the journey through the gate to the other world, and I got a little bored. At the same time, they were necessary to the plot. The main characters are responsible adults and they can't just go waltzing into new territory. I was pleasantly surprised and pleased when the plot did pick up, though.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I liked about this show were the occasional spurts of humor and fan service. A plot centered on peace between two nations could hardly be interpreted as a funny situation, but conversations and interactions between people of different countries were sometimes hilarious. Fan service also helped lighten the situation.\\n\\n\r\nAn interesting point was the translation needed between Japan and the Empire. A language barrier should be expected between different worlds, but it never occurred to me in fictional settings. Though I don't know Japanese, sometimes it seemed to me that the people of the other world were also speaking Japanese, though. I could pick up snippets of conversation, so it perplexed me a little. I understand there must be dialects, but hmm...\\n\\n\r\nThe art for scenery and backgrounds was pretty fantastic. It was important for showcasing the other world's forests, ancient buildings, and such in contrast with Japan's modern structures.\\n\\n\r\nThe best part of the animation in my opinion was the detail put into military equipment, like the tanks, planes, and guns. They were super cool and enhanced the story immensely.\\n\\n\r\nI think the characters looked pretty wonderful, though. They were very colorful and unique, with distinct hair colors, hair styles, and clothes. The animators paid great detail to their clothes, distinguishing between soldiers of rank and those of royalty. I think they did a great job with drawing people of different races. Even face shapes and noses were different. It was all pretty cool.\\n\\n\r\nFor some reason there are a lot of shots where the screen is cut into at least three pieces to show different characters or different angles of equipment. I didn't mind it so much in the beginning, but I think it's a little overdone. \\n\\n\r\nWhat struck me about the opening song was how casual it sounded. I was expecting something more in my face and epic because of the plot involving war and stuff, but it was a little rock and laid back, sort of like Itami's personality. The rest of the soundtracks suited the mood in times of battle, life, fear, etc. I didn't find many of them that memorable, though.\\n\\n\r\nAll the characters were pretty different, though because there were a lot of them, their development isn't as much as I had hoped. However, with respect to the people of the other world, their development is mostly due to the existence of the gate. They come to understand the new world and accustom themselves to their ways, and in doing so they become different people, more independent and intelligent.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, the most important one is the protagonist Itami, and he exceeded my expectations immensely. At first he is construed as some 33-year-old otaku crazy about doujinshi, and suddenly he is command of a squad and giving orders to soldiers and defends villages. How's that for development? The kicker is throughout the show he's still the calm and laid back person he was when he started. Even in dire situations he keeps his cool, never breaking a sweat. Even if he's an excellent commander, though, he still has his love for doujinshi, which I found annoying at first, but became used to later on.\\n\\n\r\nI'm pretty satisfied with having watched this show. While the entertainment wasn't heart-stopping, I did binge watch a few episodes, and the cliffhangers were not annoying ones. The plot develops smoothly, animation is great and not overdone, soundtrack is fine, and characters are great. If you're up for an anime possessing a serous plot dotted with some humor, action, and fantasy, maybe you should give GATE a try.",

This also features element of what the world would respond because as you watch you find that Japan must face two decision however since i can't put spoiler i won't say it. Also i find that Gate is very interesting as it takes the aspect of monster coming out of the \"gate\". Instead of fighting and getting rid of the \"monster\" then proceeding to close the gate,  they instead enter the other dimension and proceed to somewhat occupied it. As you watchthis you find that they are somewhat immortal however that's not where the true strong point of this anime. Also note that i say somewhat immortal as they can easily still die if their not careful. However the strong point of this anime i would say is how a military would proceed when facing such unknown. I would strongly recommend this to people who are interested in realism and a bit of fantasy. Also as you watch this anime you find that Japan can't send their entire military force to occupied it.",

The battlefield transforms into a foot tour of Japan and a very in-depth analysis of the perfect Japanese culture, leaving the main conflict to collect dust.  By the time you've finished the first season, you'll wonder how exactly you went fromheated warfare to a tourist simulation.",

His work got adapted to manga in 2011 with illustrations by SatoruSao. 2015 an anime was birthed into this harsh harsh world.\\n\\n\r\nWhat i liked . . . Rory . . . she is the most badass character in this series. Her going crazy was fun to watch.\\n\r\nThe idea of it all . . . was unique, i can actually say that i have never once thought what it would be like for our army to straight mortal combat a platoon of spear men from the 14th century.\\n\r\nIt kept me watching because i know now with all our martial knowledge, compared to a 14th century dude, we have the brain advantage while they have the brawn advantage from the harsher life style. I was interested in how they were going to do the conversations between each time zone and the politics of finding a treasure trove of valuable resources and how they were going to go about taking it all. Unfortunately none of this has really happened yet. . . It will though . . . right? \\n\\n\r\nMood Progression throughout 12 eps: \\n\r\n:)  =>  :]  =>  :(\\n\\n\r\nThe niet goed. Turning an original idea into a cliche harem was so disappointing because i was rooting for the main and his exploits. Him saving people and whatnot and then its turned into a bad comedy with drama your like ahh shit thats just to bad . . here have a cookie. . .\\n\r\nTheres no suspense, no reason to think theres trouble around the corner, or at least a reason to tread lightly. Na none of that basically in the first 2 eps the army shows there bow and arrows are alot better and thats it . . . the proud people of the 14th century will get back to you with some retaliation later. First we will focus on the girls. Why the girls you ask because the story and progression and . . .ramble. . .rant .  .. (clears throat) . . .sorry bout that. . .\\n\r\nWhat im trying to say is theres no learning in this series. You dont see the way people live which is an opportunity wasted, you dont see the way people would really act in that era, opportunity wasted, the politics are really dulled down, opportunity wasted, we know its not gonna be action based because of the onslaught on arnus hill. (Our army tears the archers and infantry apart which makes sense.) What they have chosen is to focus on the main and his women. . . Another harem where plot is secondary and chatting up chicks that you will never find in real life is whats important. . . Well i hope that this isn't the case but i think it will be.\\n\\n\r\nDo i recommend this. . . ? Nope. . . Im someone that loves anime and want people to see its good parts. If i showed this to a non anime viewer they would have a harder time appreciating what anime is and should be remembered as. . . Gate has all the makings of a good anime but in the end doesn't use its assets to its fullest and instead focuses on a harem style relationship. . .  at least its a unique harem but no its not really. . .\\n\\n\r\nI rate this nothing special. I wanted it to be. . . but it wasn't. . .\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Unlike other anime's that have teenagers as the main protagonist this one has a 20-30 yrs old Army Lieutenant, who turns out to be an otaku. The art style is damn good, the details on the tanks, planes, helicopters, guns and uniform are quite well detailed. Story-wise, there may be something lacking here and there but overall if you are fond of military weapons and tactics, fantasy, history or you just want to watch some actionand the Japanese Self-Defense Force going all \"blitzkrieg\" then this anime is definitely a must watch",

            "content": "I can't get enough of this.  I have to say that this is by far the best anime collision of Fantasy and RL I've ever see so far. \r\nFirst off Itami, this Otaku of otaku's, this guy who acts as the single largest blight on society; who's only care is his single passion in the world, his absolute adoration of all things anime. This guy somehow ends up becoming the biggest hero in all of Japan for single handedly turning the tide of what starts out as a complete disaster into a well maintained defense in the center of Tokyo by an invasion fromanother world. Then as time goes on you learn that this always aloof person, actually has the training and experience that is the equivalent of a Green Brae, Navy Seal, Special Ops, Black Ops soldier; and his best friend in the army is the guy with the animal girl fetish!\\n\\n\r\nThen you add in your Demi-god of Darkness, Young Genius Mage, and traumatized Forest Elf characters (all who happen to be girls) into the mix of his echelon that forms as he is forced back into the army to go through this gate to another world and fight back against the initial invasion. Then if this hodge-podge, mismatched, unorthodox group doesn't get you interested the number and scale of inconveniences that get dropped in their laps most certainly will. It is completely outrageous, and I mean that in the best ways.\\n\\n\r\nAnd in episode 6 you have a scene with what looks to be fully decked out AH-64 Apache, and Blackhawk helicopters flying in a criss-crossing formation; While, playing \"Flight of the Valkyrie\" on exterior mounted loudspeakers approaching their target which is a castle at siege.  If this doesn't get your inner evil genius to make you laugh maniacally I don't know what will.",

            "content": "*Spoiler Free Review*\r\nAnother exposition and trope free review from yours truly here. I'm just going to give a short but concise review of this show where I express my reasons for rating it as I have. \r\n*Disclaimer* I'm not really plugged into the \"hype culture\" so my review will be completely unaffected by it. \r\nStory: 8/10\r\nIf you're interested in a recap read the synopsis section of the anime list; i'm not going to bore you with another summary here. Overall the story isn't all that original, a gateway to another world, magic, knights, etc. however the manner in which they tell the story is verywell put together. It's serious when it needs to be, funny in all the right places, and believable enough to make it rather enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10 \\n\\n\r\nNothing new or fantastic to talk about here, hence the 7 (good) score only. The entire anime is well drawn or animated. Not to many instances of single frames with long dialog to save on animation budgets here. Action sequences are well done. Sorry for the short section on the art, its just that as of 2015 I've come to expect the animation and artwork quality of any serious anime to be of this caliber or better. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe OST wasn't anything amazing but it fit well where it was needed. Other than that I don't really have much to say except this is one of the few anime I have watched recently with an opening theme that I thought was actually worth listening to rather than skipping past. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nIt seems to be a trend now a days that all anime have specific character sets within them. The reluctant hero, the loli-bad ass, the shy elf, the power hungry emperor, etc. However, because of the way the story is written this pretty standard set of characters actually mesh quite well. The almost harem-like cast that supports the main character is almost laughable except that the show knows this and pokes fun at itself in the process. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAnd now the only category that really matters to me! I gave this show an outstanding rank 10/10 for enjoyment because quite frankly, besides Overloard, I haven't seen an anime this entertaining in quite some time. The mixture of the story, the fan-service (yes there is some but it seems to be just the right amount for me), the characters, the uses of tropes from other famous military style movies and shows makes things so incredibly amusing there were times that my jaw hurt from smiling and laughing so hard. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI ranked \"Gate\" an 8/10 (very good) because I thought it was a incredibly entertaining show; the only reason I didn't rank it higher is because I couldn't possibly compare it with the likes of Cowboy Bebop or Code Geass. Being entertained is the whole point right? Anime is supposed to be another medium for great story-telling and I would have to say if you're in the mood for a modern-military \"what-if\" scenario style show then I guarantee you'll be a fan of Gate. Are there some things in this that are used in many other shows, yes, but who cares! One final point I would like to make about this show is the way they show reactions to people coming into contact with things that they cannot believe to be real. If you watch the show you'll know what I'm talking about. Some peoples reactions to things are priceless. All I'm going to say here is JDSF Apache/Cobra Attack Helicopter with a minigun... >:D\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this show to a friend? Yes! 100%. In fact I think the premise of the show is so good that someone like the Sci-Fi channel could probably do a \"live action\" version of this show (obviously altering a few things) with some pretty decent results; but that is just my opinion.",

            "content": "Now this is going to be a quick review, for those who don't like reading a lot. I'm going to assume you've read the plot (or watched the anime) so you know mostly what should be going on.\r\nHere's a short spoiler free summary tho: (you can skip this)\r\nAfter a gate appears in Ginza and causes some ruckus, Itami Youji, a 33 year old otaku, along with other soldiers is sent through it to see what's on the other side. As the story progresses 4 main girls are introduced; Pina Co Lada, Rory Mercury, Tuka Luna Marceau and Lelei La Lalena. They go through some eventsin order to achieve peace between Japan and The Empire.\\n\\n\r\nStory: (may contain VERY minimal spoilers) 10\\n\r\nI thought this was very interesting. I have seen Outbreak Company but wasn't much of a fan because of all the harem, which Gate managed to mostly dodge (at least for the first season). But the story of going to another world and exchanging the cultures is always intriguing. That's like when you show people the trap characters and they're shocked. The progress went very well, smooth and without any complicated subjects or events. Everything was straightforward and unlike some army anime, required no heavy thinking. A tiny bit bubbly, yet serious and well balanced for everybody's enjoyment. And of course, the ending makes you want to watch the second season.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nThe art was quite common, but very good. Amazing visuals and the fights were well done. I personally had no complains. If you're not a fan of big eyed girls (like a friend I have) you might find this fit, since they have all sorts of eye designs.\\n\\n\r\nSounds: 9\\n\r\nThe sound in this anime was not remarkable or memorable but very well aligned with the scenes, making them even more interesting and less boring. It did the job very well to me so I also have no complains.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Spoiler free- 9\\n\r\nIf you know anything about me, you most likely know how much I usually find the male protagonist annoying. This also applies to books and movies, not only anime. However Itami was different, or at least managed to bend my view of him. At first, I didn't like him much; he's the nice all girls over him type of Otaku that you see a lot in anime, VERY COMMON. But then you start to know more about him and although we still don't know much, I could say he does great job at being a neutral to me. I just don't mind him.\\n\r\nThe girls were awesome. I liked almost everything about them all and hopefully that doesn't change next season. My favourite was Lelei, but I liked Rory a lot too, especially because of how powerful she was.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nThe show was very enjoyable all from the beginning to the end. Didn't bore me and kept me starting the next episodes without hesitation. I finished it in less than 2 days.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8- very good.",

            "content": "DISCLAIMER: this review contains spoilers for the first 2 episodes and is for the whole season (MAL has wrongly broken it into 2 parts)\r\nOne of my favourite Video essayists once said, \u201cArt is all about pushing your buttons\u201d\r\nAnd I tend to agree with him on that statement, but what does this have to do with Gate: Jieitai Kanochi nite, Kaku Tatakaeri (GATE for short)? \r\nEverything, and during this review I am going to tell you why. \r\nGATE is a 24-part Web-Novel /Manga adaptation by A-1 pictures, a studio that has often been the centre of controversy and producer of some of the most polarising showsin recent anime History.\\n\r\nThe plot follows a low-mid ranking Otaku soldier named Y\u014dji Itami. The world he lives in is generally identical to our own, until one day a ominous gate opens in the middle of Tokyo\u2019s Ginza shopping district and an Army from a medieval fantasy world invades, slaughtering anyone in their way.\\n\r\nThe first episode opens with Itami having the day off, attending a local convention and being inevitably caught in the middle of this. Some quick thinking on his part manages to save a large amount of people from the Invaders and keeps them safe until the Japanese Self-Defence Forces arrive and inevitably slaughter the invaders.\\n\r\nNow if you are anything like me the concept of a modern Military, politics and society facing off against their Fantastical counterparts, sounds incredibly appealing and the first few episodes will probably thirsting for more. What this work has done to you in this case, is push your buttons; it has peeked your interest and made you react and be invested.\\n\r\n\u201cWhy is this important?\u201d you ask, and rightfully so. It is important, because of how the Series develops.\\n\r\nThese first episodes, with their gripping plot (interspersed with some comedy), simultaneously upbeat but grim opening, brilliant choice of sound; and the brilliantly looking art and good animation typical for A-1 Pictures, are very much the setup for the actual plot of the later episodes,\\n\r\nThese follow the escapades of Itami, who has been promoted to 2nd Lieutenant for his actions in Ginza, as he Leads a small Recon unit making first contact with the locals after the first pushes through the Gate. On his journey he (as probably could be guessed by the opening and cover art) meets and inevitably is followed by a \u201cdiverse\u201d cast of typical Fantasy females.\\n\r\nNow this may be where most people see warning signs come up, and one can most defiantly not blame them for this. HOWEVER, to GATE\u2019s credit is seems to have kept it to a reasonable level so far.\\n\r\nThis shift in tone and focus will inevitably scare some people off, but for those willing to brave it, GATE delivers a Vibrant wold, filled with strong personalities, intrigue and the occasional, \u201c(modern) Humanity Fuck Yeah\u201d Action feasts.\\n\\n\r\nIn summery\\n\r\nGate is a \u201cModern VS fantasy\u201d action/adventure with more plot and background than a story of this calibre has any right to, sufficiently interesting characters, Beautiful art, more than passable CGI and animation, good sound and (in second half) Very good music choices, all leading to a high level of enjoyment\\n\r\nGiving it a numerical breakdown of:\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\r\nEnjoymnet: 8\\n\r\nLeading to a weighted total of : 7,5\\n\\n\r\nFor further \u201creading\u201d on the topic of \u201cbuttons\u201d\\n\r\nI recommend Digibo\u2019s Video Essay: Art Is All About Pressing Your Buttons! \\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/SsQB9RhixhQ\\n",

Well if you think that what the story like then I am sorry to tell you that gate is otaku pandering and Japanese propaganda to the max.\\n\r\nAnd I am not jokeing when I say this.\\n\r\nThe underline story is basically Japanese propaganda and otaku pandering.\\n\\n\r\nFor the otaku pandering part you got a fantasy world filled with most otaku fedish's like lolis,elfs,animal girls and etc.\\n\\n\r\nit also includes a main protagonist as an otaku who is a hero to the people and has been starting collecting girls for his haram. \\n\r\nThere is also A lot of fan service.\\n\\n\r\nFor the Japanese propaganda part. \\n\r\nYou got the leaders of America,China,Russia government acting like one dimensional evil villains who want to take over the fantasy world and mine it for natural resources for money or eta.\\n\r\nWhile the noble Japanese government what to protect the fantasy people from those who would have evil intentions like America,China,Russia.\\n\\n\r\nAnother example of this propaganda is how normal Japanese soldiers where actually able to beat highly trained American blacks ops who probably have years of combat experience.\\n\\n\r\nI get it Japan your still salty about World War Two but you have to get over it,\\n\r\nThe Japanese army isn't as strong as it used to be and you have to understand that.\\n\\n\r\nBut Also I would like to add that any country would probably do the same if a new land popped up and it was full of untapped resources and one county was just like no we call dibs on this.\\n\r\nThis is global politics 101.\\n\\n\r\nBut apparently you can't have a war drama  without all these \"important\" elements like otaku pandering and Japanese propaganda. \\n\r\nActually it isn't a war drama is more like a war dud.\\n\r\nBecause Who needs Gray morality or deep themes or good characters even.\\n\r\nwhat the fuck is that? Take the safe rote and hope the plebs will bite and call it a master piece of mature writing which it really isn't.\\n\\n\r\nSo gate had the potential to be a good war drama and if it had taken it self seriously it would have Been good. But sadly it decided to Take the Safe route And becomes a soulless otaku pandering wish fill ment bull shit with a war thrown in as flavoring.\\n\r\nAnd when I think about this could have been a pretty decent harem if it wasn't for the war and the badly explored politics.\\n\r\nHell it could have been a decent adventure story if you again remove the war and politics.\\n\\n\r\nActually when I think about.\\n\r\nthe war and political elements really do actually drag it down to the mud.\\n\r\nBecause this could have been a fun story with harem and ecchi shit happening,\\n\r\nAnd It would probably be a ten times better show.\\n\r\nAnd that is saying something.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters, 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThe main character Itami is the most out of place thing in his setting. \\n\r\nHe is pretty much an otaku with a pretty decent ranking the military. \\n\r\nAnd I understand that anyone can have a hobby that's outside their work place.\\n\r\nBut I would think if he was a soldier for the army he would be a lot more fit or in fact more highly trained.\\n\r\nI know he not part of the black ops or any highly trained military.\\n\r\nBut in all honesty he doesn't even act or feel like a soldier.\\n\r\nBecause I have meet people that are or where part of the military in some point in there lives.\\n\r\nAnd he doesn't have that vide about him.\\n\r\nEven when I include  other anime with military people in them.\\n\\n\r\n his presence is probably the most jarring thing in this show.\\n\\n\r\nThe side character are very one note and are as bland as toast.\\n\r\nAll the characters are spupind,\\n\r\nEven the military leaders Who are In charge.\\n\\n\r\nThere not even a single  character I care about in this entire show.\\n\\n\r\nThere is no character development or fleshing out. \\n\r\nEven though there could be with the whole war thing.\\n\r\nBecause war is very stressful and losing your friends or killing things can do things to people.\\n\r\nSome it doesn't really affect them and others well PTSD is quite the popular way to go about things.\\n\r\nNot one character say especially from the Japanese army \\n\r\nWhat is this fighting actually actually doing to us or how do people feel when killing entire army's in mare seconds.\\n\\n\r\nThey feel like robots they just point, shot, repeat.\\n\\n\r\nBut in the flip side It more reasonable for the people from the fantasy world to act like that.\\n\r\nBecause death and fighting are more common for them,\\n\r\nEspecially When you make in the midevil  fantasy world setting as context for that.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt, 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is very average as a whole.\\n\r\nIt has some very colorful backgrounds.\\n\r\nThe art style is very generic.\\n\\n\r\nI like some of the character designs,\\n\r\nNot there not amazing or mind blowing in any way.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound, 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe op I don't care about and the ending is probably the worse choice they could of picked for a ending song.\\n\r\nBecause it so upbeat even though people are getting killed in mass in the show.\\n\r\nIt doesn't fit very well.\\n\\n\r\nThe ost was fine for the most part.\\n\r\nIt was done by yoshiaki Fujisawa.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, 6/10\\n\\n\r\nSo over all despite being quite negative towards this show in general. I did quite find it quite entertaining at times.\\n\r\nLike for example when the empire tried to attack the Japanese base and the empire army got recked almost instantly.\\n\r\nWhich I fould funny because the empire army was so cocky and thinking they were going to win and then they get ripped apart by gun fire. \\n\r\nThat was favorite part,\\n\r\nIt got even better when they did it a few more times with a bigger army each time.\\n\r\nAnd still got ripped apart easily.\\n\r\nThose episodes are probably the most fun I ever had in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnd sadly it never go back to the quitly  those episodes had \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, 4/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you like simple shows with fan service and fantasy elements then gate is an anime you will like. But if your looking for a war drama that takes it's self seriously then you won't find it here along with over things like logic or gray characters.\\n\\n\r\nAlso if this was supposed to be some sort of advertisement for the Japanese army then it's a fail.\\n\r\nEven as that.",

But the changes between the manga to the anime isn't even the standard \"Oh the anime left some stuff out.\" - pretty much nothing is the same except the designs on some of the main cast. Every male character is strippedof personality to be as projectable as possible and interesting female characters turn into basic waifu material. Whatever they cut out they filled with Sword Art which is in my \"get drunk and watch it with friends\" category.\\n\\n\r\nIf you have any love for this series you fill love it even more if you go to the source material afterwards.",

Parallel universe attacks, then the world they attack attacks them back. I think I would have enjoyed this more if it stayed as a gritty military and political drama instead of adding sexy elves, magical girls and goth lolis. \r\nIt isn't really a bad show, but I feel that something needs to be more than simply \"not bad\" to stand out. The way I felt watching this reminds me how I felt during GodEater. Both were extremely generic, while managing to remain just good enough to be good. I should have dropped God Eater as well. I did not make that mistake again. What really bothers me about this show is that they can't seem to make up their mind about what they want the show to be. The Emperor using the JSDF to wipe out his political rivals was awesome, and I expected a lot more of that political ruthlessness right off the bat. Instead we get the protagonist recruiting girls into his harem.\\n\\n\r\nThe show looks good, sure. It sounds okay. But the characters aren't memorable. I didn't learn the names of any squad members, they were not interesting at all. \\n\\n\r\nAnd yet...I still recommend this.

Depending on how I go from here.\r\nOkay, Where do I start? \r\nFor Story I'll give it an 8 due to the fact that it mashes together the seriousness and reality of the military yet giving it it's own unique Vibe.  Other than that, the story of Kingdom Politics and the waning powers of Empires speaks volumes about The History of Some European Countries (*Cough *Cough Holy Roman Empire *Cough *Cough) and when faced with Modernization it rejects it and stays true to it's tradition, which albeit is a goodthing, Some Modernization is always Required. And when an enemy which is much more advance than them comes and manages to smash their armies in battle after battle. They still continue to fight on, which is quite admirable sometimes, but this is just an unnecessary slaughter. Now, We have the main story of the MC which is interlocks stories with an Elf, Priestess, and a Human Mage, as well as the CIA and many other Secret organizations.\\n\\n\r\nFor Art It's an 8, Not much could be said really.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is quite good so it's a 9\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are very good and unique though it could do a bit more development and polishing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment is a matter of Opinion really, For it I'll give it 10. I enjoyed the Mainly funny moments it gives and also the seriousness that is secretly going behind those funny moments.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would say that it's a 9\\n\\n\r\n(BTW, This is my first review so forgive me if it may seem really confusing and unpolished.)",

There really wasn't amazing artwork towards the end vs the beginning.  \r\nSound 6: Nothing really impressive there, the opening song was great and so wasthe closing song.  Other than that there wasn't really tracks that really got me during the show was playing.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 6:  There really isn't anything special here.. they all stay the same person, no one really develops anything, expect for lelei.  Then you have Itami who is just a badass, but doesn't really play or viewed as that role.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9:  As much as I kind of \"talked down\" about this show, I really did enjoy it.  It was really funny and I love seeing what their next adventure was going to be.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall 7: Great show, felt like they could of done more to this show and also if the anime were to be like the first few episodes I think I would of loved it more.

That's what's wrong with this anime. \r\nThe story did a great job sharing what would happen if medieval weaponry met current weaponry, but that very creativity is the story's downfall. My only enjoyment in this came from the fact that there were elves, gods and magic in a medieval setting coupled with the idea that I could imagine myself there fairly easily, that aside it was dreadfully boring. Even when they went into politicsit was far too straightforward. The story was sapped by the sole fact that the whole story was one sided. Basically nothing happened throughout the entire story. \"Shit, badguys. Shoot your gun... Oh, they're dead and we didn't lose anyone\" rinse and repeat. I'm looking into the light novel with hopes that it's better than the anime and gets more detailed. Magic looks like it has great potential to be competition against Japan's military and there might be fights with other countries from earth.",

            "content": "Quite enjoyable military fantasy. \r\nAll too often we have some dragon popup and the military ends up completely powerless only to have some teenager with a magic sword solve the worlds problems.  This basically reverses that type of plot and instead we see with some degree of realism the amount of firepower that modern(ish) military weapons have.  We also have a MC who is 33 and already a member of the JSDF (albeit known as a slacker) when the story starts. \r\nWe do get a bit of a pseudo-harem with the MC being surrounded by several attractive females from the fantasy world, butthe amount of romantic attraction is mostly limited to one of them and there are several other supporting male characters.  I did find the fantasy characters to be slightly predictable, but not so much that they ruined the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe amount of \"Japan, heck yeah\" is quite thick at times, but this is fairly standard from a military themed show.  It's mostly when you see it from another country's POV that it becomes somewhat noteworthy.  On that note - there is some interesting politics in the fantasy world, but the real world is mostly presented as cardboard cutouts in terms of politics.  But then again the fun is on the fantasy encounter.\\n\\n\r\nThis has some gore, compared to the magna it is toned down a bit by having some of the more hardcore stuff either occur off screen (but still occur) or be changed a tiny bit. I felt that in the first season/cour that the only place I really felt this was the introduction of Rory.  So don't think that because this is a fantasy there isn't a lot of bloodshed and stuff.",

Some of the focus isn't where it needed to be. Kind of lost itself to the anime tropes later on, focusing less on the military side. Has art that gets the job done, a couple memorable moments, characters that are kind of forgettable, and a \"meh\" soundtrack. \r\nShould you Watch?\r\nDepends. If you like anime, go for it. If you want something epic, don't. If you want something to watch when you're bored this is perfect.",

            "content": "The blending of two completely different genres can be something completely genius when executed correctly. However when done wrong it can doom an entire anime. Gate falls into the prior with a creative narrative that is far from typical. As a fan of high fantasy stories, I was pleasantly suprised but the blend of military warfare and mythical fantasy proves to be a surprisingly great relationship. \r\n So what is Gate? Gate: Thus the JSDF fought there is the summer 2015 anime based off the light novel of the same name. The narrative follows a 33 year old otaku who is a struggling lieutenantin the special defense force. Than a gate to a parallel dimension unexpectedly opens and he saves countless lives in the attacks. He then becomes a leader of a recon team and heads into this dimension to interact with locals and bring peace between Japan and the special region.\\n\\n\r\n So what impressed me about this show is the integration of politics. And these politics aren't boring, in fact I think it give the story some depth and intrigue. The story in this show is so great because the political structure of the Empire and the fact that Japan is under constant political pressure from other super powers in the world is well explored and explained.\\n\\n\r\n  When you look at the genres here you don't normally think that they would go together as well as they do. But damn the execution is AMAZING. The high fantasy medieval empire with elves, Demi gods, and mages that feels like it's straight out of lord of the rings. Clashes with a modern militaristic style modern Tokyo. The characters in this show interact with such a foreign environment perfectly and they show how they have to adapt to such a new world. The comedy is also well integrated in this story. So as a creative story with political depth and intrigue that works with high fantasy and military elements, Gate is a success hands down. \\n\\n\r\n  You can't have a great world like this without great characters and I have to say the characters in Gate had me satisfied to say the very least. First we have our main character, Itami. He's an otaku and the most unlikely hero I can think of in anime. He has a nice personality and despite being kind of average by a soldier standard, he is still very fun to watch and a unique lead character. The most interesting thing with the character is not the characters themselves, but the excellent character interaction and relationship. The way these soldiers are so loyal to Itami is great enough, but there relationship with these mythical beings are quite dynamic. The Mage Leilei is very curious and had a fun role as the language interpreter . The Demi God Rory had a witty and rebellious personality and added some rollicking fun. And the Elf Tuka's mental illness and denial of her father's death was very intriguing. \\n\\n\r\n  The way all of these diverse personalities play off each other was very fun to watch and it shows that they don't really care about a stupid war. Itami and his team come to realize that they want to create friendships and exploring the unique world, and how it's not just as source for resources like other countries are looking at it. It's an opportunity for them to broaden their knowledge and build diplomatic relationship and peace. \\n\\n\r\n  The art is very well done with good detail and color. And the OST and opening theme were both excellent. However I found the eyes to be drawn oddly and it was a tad distracting. It wasn't that big of a deal though. At the beginning I felt it was a bit too fast paced and the plot felt a little forced. For an example of what I'm talking about, the gate to the other world just randomly appeared so quickly. I mean no explanation it just appeared. Another problem I had was that some side characters should have been more developed. And lastly the conclusion was a cliffhanger but I can't be too mad due to a second season currently airing. \\n\\n\r\n  So in conclusion this anime was a pleasent and highly creative surprise. Interesting characters, fun story, good world building, good art, great music, and a fantastic blend of opposite genres. Gate is something that you mustn't miss and is a must watch for a good narrative of political intrigue, high fantasy, and modern warfare.",

            "content": "Hey kids, have you ever wanted to live in a fantasy anime with dragons, elves, nekomimis, and complete other bullcrap? Me neither! Don't worry though, because this anime called Gate does just that for you, except not quite as you'd think. Alright folks, let's HACK INTO THE GATE!\r\n(My god, did I just say that? I just said that...)\r\nLet's add a synopsis, because no bad review ever has a synopsis in it!\r\nSYNOPSIS:\r\nIn August of 20XX, a portal to a parallel world, known as the \"Gate,\" suddenly appeared in Ginza, Tokyo. Monsters and troops poured out of the portal, turning the shopping district into a bloody inferno.\r\nTheJapan Ground-Self Defence Force immediately took action and pushed the fantasy creatures back to the \"Gate.\" To facilitate negotiations and prepare for future fights, the JGSDF dispatched the Third Reconnaissance Team to the \"Special Region\" at the other side of the Gate.\\n\\n\r\nYouji Itami, a JSDF officer as well as a 33-year-old otaku, was appointed as the leader of the Team. Amid attacks from enemy troops the team visited a variety of places and learnt a lot about the local culture and geography.\\n\\n\r\nThanks to their efforts in humanitarian relief, although with some difficulties they were gradually able to reach out to the locals. They even had a cute elf, a sorceress and a demigoddess in their circle of new friends. On the other hand, the major powers outside the Gate such as the United States, China, and Russia were extremely interested in the abundant resources available in the Special Region. They began to exert diplomatic pressure over Japan.\\n\\n\r\nA suddenly appearing portal to an unknown world\u2014to the major powers it may be no more than a mere asset for toppling the international order. But to our protagonists it is an invaluable opportunity to broaden knowledge, friendship, and ultimately their perspective towards the world.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY:\\n\\n\r\nSo for the 100% that didn't read the synopsis, Japan randomly gets attacked by a bunch of dragons, orcs and trolls. It's as if the Internet became real life.\\n\\n\r\nJapan, being in the 21st century and stocked with heavy artillery, go Hiroshima all up ons the dragons n shiz. If that wasn't enough, they decide to go into their dimension so they can genocide their sorry medieval booties.\\n\\n\r\nLet's meet our faptastic cast, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\\n\r\nFirst off, we got otaku weeb trash that u aspire to be. Get this, the guy is basically the highest grade of Japanese Marine someone can possibly be. \\n\\n\r\n\"Your taste in anime is trash!\"\\n\\n\r\nThat guy will freaking find out where you live. As a matter of fact:\\n\\n\r\n\"What the fuck did you just fucking say about my waifu,you little bitch? I'll\ufeff have you know I am known on numerous otaku website's,and i've been involved in numerous meet ups across japan and I have over 300 Limited DVD release's of naruto. I am trained in Kanji and Katakana and I'm the top of my club at my local akihabara store. I will show you the otaku way's and skill with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth,mark my fucking words. You baka gaijin.\"\\n\\n\r\nYeah, this guy is my inspiration.\\n\\n\r\nThen you have the three girls that convinced you to watch the show, but ultimately decided Rory is the best girl.\\n\\n\r\nThis one elf chick who has daddy issues. Literally, that's all she worries about through the entire anime.\\n\\n\r\nThen RORY MERCURY BEST GIRL OMG OMG OMG! YASSSS\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude0b\ud83d\udc95\ud83c\udf4d\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\ude0b\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udf47\ud83d\ude0b\ud83d\ude0b\ud83c\udf51\ud83c\udf4d\ud83c\udf51\ud83c\udf4d\ud83c\udf51\ud83c\udf4d\ud83c\udf51\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\ude0b\ud83d\ude0b\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\ude0b\ud83c\udf4d\ud83c\udf51\ud83d\ude0b\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\ude0b\ud83c\udf47\ud83d\udc95\ud83c\udf51\ud83d\ude0b\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc4c\\n\\n\r\nNow we have Leilei. Let's hold up for a second and talk about the utter bull crap that is Leilei. First of all, why include her and elf at all when Rory is going to get all the attention in the first place. Honestly, it just hit my hopes up and those hopes were only slightly satisfied with Leilei cuddling with otaku marine. Literally, that's the only scene she had and maybe the bath.\\n\\n\r\nSecond, I want to give props to Nao Toyama for trying a new type of character. In my opinion, she performed the personality of a Kuudere very well. However, the problem here is that even though she did well, it wasn't noticed because of Rory-sama. Toyama thrives when her character is the best girl, but her character was, for once, not the best. I'll just hold onto my hopes and see if she gets another opportunity to play as a Kuudere in a different show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION & MUSIC\\n\\n\r\nI want to categorize these together because my opinions are the same for both of them and that's that they're massively above average and provide enjoyment even when there was times when the story was getting boring. \\n\\n\r\nI believe the times when the animation was truly at its best was when they were in battle and animated the tanks and helicopters. The computer animation of the dragon was slight and hardly noticeable and the animations of the characters fighting was truly fluent and felt natural.\\n\\n\r\nMusic-wise, I may be biased because AKEBOSHI ROCKETS, but honestly the opening and especially the ending were great to excite and enjoy the anime. The addition of Flight of the Valkyries was an amazing addition to the soundtrack as well. Let's be honest here, that episode was a slaughter and we loved the hell out of it. I swear, I'm almost as edge hungry as this gothic Lolita goddess.\\n\\n\r\nPERSONAL ENJOYMENT:\\n\\n\r\nLet's look back on this show one more time. We have relatable otaku power soldier as the main character who literally doesn't give a f**k about anything except his anime along with some sugoku kawaii fantasy girls from my WoW dreams along with fluent battle animations and orgasmic soundtrack. Looking back at those points... Eh, it was ok. There was honestly some points that I wondered if I should drop it, but it ended up holding my attention with Lolita goddess and can we just hold up for a second here? See this chick? Her name is Pi\u00f1a Co Lada. Please tell me that was done on purpose.\\n\\n\r\nSo, is Gate worth the watch? Here's a fun factoid really quick before answering that. After researching a bit about this show, I learned that the original material creator was apart of the JDF, or whatever that special force is called. Basically, he took reliable source material from what he learned fighting for his country and made it into an anime. Combine that you're learning a bit about Japanese military with Weeaboo trash anime grills, you have a pretty dope anime.\ud83d\udc4c",

            "content": "25.09.2015\r\nTHIS IS NOT THE FINAL REVIEW! AS I CONTINUE WATCHING THE SERIES THIS REVIEW WILL CHANGE - It only shows my impressions so far. I will rework it after I finished the Anime\r\nFirst review by the way. Epicness = Extra Points (Obviously I am joking, with those points, usually there are other smaller elements, or just a feeling that make me increase the points - Kidding about that last thing here)\r\nWell, lets start with the story. By the way. I watched the show with German Subs.\r\n-Story-\r\nI was really excited when I first read the description of the Anime. 21 century meets medieval age. The ideaand potential of this anime is amazing. Tbh, I was so interested that I watched the series to episode 10 and couldnt hold myself from spoilering myself by reading through the manga. But don't you worry, this review will only tell you if the >Anime< is worth to watch, or not... \\n\\n\r\nThe storyline till now was on an average level. Until now (hehe) the Anime didn't really have a complex plot, as things just continued without any big consequences. But, watching the series still gives you the excitement you wish to have and you are always curious about what happens next, and if you are interested in what happens, then you are interested in how the story continues. If you want to continue watching an anime, because you actually WANT it, then in my opinion it is a good Anime. Maybe not a masterpiece but good and enjoyable. 8/10 for the story. \\n\\n\r\n-Atr-\\n\r\nThe Art of the anime is not something that kicks you off your chair once you start watching it. It is quite good. \\n\r\nAnything else to say..? OH YES. BATTLE SCENES. Wow. As you can imagine, when the 21. century military has to fight against medieval Military, things become... obvious. It was amazing how the animators managed to give the battles scenes this taste of EPICNESS. Oh and who didn't notice the smooth fighting style of Rory. That was very good. Pushing the Art to 8\\n\\n\r\n-Sound-\\n\r\nThe intro was quite good. It is one of those intros you don't skip at the beginning because they annoy you. You start the anime, sit down and listen how the drums introduce you to the next episode. The sound in the series itself was nothing remarkable. Could have been more though as the series sometimes has moments, where people talk and around them everything is mute. Little thing to mention, \"Walk\u00fcrenritt eng: Ride of the Valkyries\".\\n\r\nI didn't believe my ears (yep, not the eyes this time.) when I heard that music combined with that scene. But the sound of the vehicles, weapons, fights and other stuff were really damn good.\\n\\n\r\nIts a good 7/10\\n\\n\\n\r\n-Character-\\n\\n\r\nThe characters... One might say \"Oh this is so fanservice and omg ofc the leader of the squad is an otaku, oh what a coincidence he is involved in all those stuff and suddenly a super cool person with a stupid attidude waffle waffle\". \\n\r\nYes the characters, especially those from the special region, are designed to fit to the majority of Anime watching people. We got an elve, a gothlike dressed demigod, and a young sorceress. \\n\\n\r\nWe also got the squad of Itami (our protagonist), which doesn't have any special members, besides a woman who uses to talk about the background stuff sometimes. The character development of Itamis isn't really present, they are good educated soldiers, they know what to do, nothing \"that dangerous\" to face. On the other hand we got the \"Special-Regioners\" (lets just call them like that) who have to watch a might, so powerful, that it could eliminate them all within a blink, wanting nothing more than peace and friendship and at the same time, they have to fear them, because if they wanted to, they could, as stated above, eliminate them in one turn. \\n\\n\r\nWe see princess Pina with the ton pressure shes under, witnessing this might from a first person view. I think this is what we should look at. The other side. If we were to face what the Special-Regioners see currently, we would be like \"Oh thats cool, lets explore it.\" While our SRs (Special Regioners) are used to medieval standards. They are facing something completly different. A godlike might, which doesn't care if you are a honorable soldier. If it wants to, it eliminates you. A world, ruled by a people, not only by Kings and Queens. A world that aims for peace but at the same time does everything for ressources. They have to face that fact, that they need to negotiate with a world, they don't know, but at the same time, is ruled by a race they know. This isn't like some ET wants to destroy earth, it is different. And this is the place where the character development shows itself. As I said before, I did read the Manga so I know that Character Development will happen, pretty good development though. But this rating is for the anime thus a fair 6/10.\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment-\\n\r\nEnjoyment. Well. I really... really enjoy watching this series. It is just great and interesting to witness this clash of ages. Of course you have episodes where (felt) nothing happens. But you still want to know what exactly happens even if it is nothing special. It is a sign of a good Anime to make the viewer curious, (best tool in this Anime is the good old Cliffhanger). I like to watch this series and I will continue watching it.\\n\\n\r\n A strong and outstanding 10/10\\n\\n\r\nIn the last version of my review, I called this Anime already one of the best Animes this year. This of course is just an expectation, as I don't know the exact full story. It has a lot of potencial, very much. From what I've seen so far, this is a very good anime and I hope it gets better as it continues.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR or SL;WTRM (So long; want to read more).\\n\\n\r\nYou sometimes need these setups, that look too random, for a good story (this setup is the perfect example). This is not a bad thing, this is what makes something interesting. This Anime is worth to watch and is enjoyable, even for people who have nothing much to do with the militaristic scene of Animes.\\n\\n\r\nRecommended.",

            "content": "GATE is a story that, however extremely enjoyable in some areas, is seriously lacking in others. This show presents a setting that is not by any means original. In fact, one such example of a similar series which kept popping into my head would be the 90's movie and television series, \"Stargate\". Which shares aspects such as a paranormal \"wormhole\" to another world, as well as modern military power interacting with a primitive civilization. These aspects have become very well known and popular within the sci-fi community, to the point of almost being considered cliched. Although, GATE is a show that adds just enough tolet it stand apart from the rest, and introduces it into a medium that allows for it to be told in a way not yet attempted. However, originality, unfortunately, was not the only issue I had. There is no doubt that GATE was designed to be a very nationalistic series, promoting Japan and her SDF as best as possible, and there is nothing at all wrong with that! Hell, I'm from the US, we generate media like this more than anyone. However, it wasn't the nationalistic sentiment that irked me, it was the downright xenophobic twist the story takes. Other nations in this universe are portrayed extremely unrealistically, to the point of being comically evil. Now, I UNDERSTAND that this is anime, the place where realism goes to quiver in the corner crying, however, considering the story that GATE is trying to tell, it seemed that a realistic portrayal of world powers would be somewhat essential. However, if you know the source material, and its creator, you'd understand why it took this turn. Yet, I can't help but be a bit disappointed at the lost potential.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style of this show has encountered mixed reactions from fans, however, I myself quite enjoyed the look of it. GATE seems to have fallen into the recent trend of using a very diverse color pallet, and utilizes a neat and satisfying motion in its animation. The style very loosely reminded me of that of the series \"No Game No Life\", which also had a very bright and appealing aesthetic.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the OP to the background tracks, as well as the voice acting and SFX, the sound of this show maintained a very pleasing consistency. The music always seemed to fit the mood, and added an even greater depth of impact during some of the shows more prominent action sequences. I'm not Japanese, so I am not sure I am one to judge voice acting, yet I can honestly say there was not a voice I felt that did not fit a character, so I would be inclined to say the director made some good choices in that regard. In addition, the SFX were very well crafted. In an action/military themed series like this, with loud and intensive battles, it is very important to do it justice with a proper mix of sounds that make up the environment. I have to say I was very pleased with how they directed this, and it made the whole show have a very 3-dimensional feel to it in terms of production value.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I felt was somewhat lacking in GATE would be any real character development. I would not go as far as to say it was bad, as the characters presented in the story were very likable, and definitely felt like human beings. However, it was the lack of any real change or development in any of their personalities that really nagged at me. I mean, considering the extraordinary situation they were thrown into, all the lives they were forced to take, you would think it would at least strike a cord. So yes, this is one area in the show in which I found myself unimpressed.\\n\\n\r\nLast but not least, my personal enjoyment. Overall, looking past any minor quarrels I might have with the story or characters , I am loving this show. I'm a sucker for intense battles, and generally kicking ass, so if your into that as well, you will defiantly enjoy this show.\\n\\n\r\nMy rating for the series thus far is a sold 7/10. The art and sound present a very crisp and immersive world which you can't help but love, but in the fields of story and character there were some genuine disappointments, as well as some likable aspects on the flip-side. However, either has yet to impress me. Although, as the season has yet to come to a close, I guess my opinion might be subject to change in future edits, but I am definitely looking forward to it! This show has been one hell of a ride, and continues to entertain regardless of whatever nitpicks I throw at it, so I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a show to have some fun, or just to see some bad guys get blown to kingdom come. Either is great in my book!\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading! Olluxo out...",

            "content": "Gate is interesting because of the fusion of modern world and fantasy/Roman/medieval world. I always like seeing guns and missiles rekt knights and traditional tactics and weapons and these makes Gate satisfying because it\u2019s done right and we can see the difference between two world and unsatisfying because I still got to wait next year.\r\nGate\u2019s cast isn\u2019t anything special but at least the MC is kind of likable and most of the characters have different traits, personality and characteristics. Rory as a yandere, Lelei as the curious, cute mage, Tuka as you know\u2026. I don\u2019t know, traumatized because her father is dead? Then we gotthe MC Itami which not your usual otaku, because Itami is actually a human being who works in the military (although he seems a bit OP) , then Pina Co Lada (God, I love that song) who is what we expected as a princess, patriotic and will do anything to save her nation from getting rekt by Glorious Nippon.\\n\\n\r\nGate\u2019s technical aspects aren\u2019t bad either. We got nice and realistic animation of weapons and tanks and helicopters. It has a good music, a good OP and ED and most of all, Wagner. The censorship didn\u2019t bother me at all since I haven\u2019t read the manga and it wouldn\u2019t make a difference even if I read it before. \\n\\n\r\nGate is a fun show and it has little problems especially the unrealistic politics.

            "content": "Throughout history, the concept of discovering new lands has ended with one of two possibilities.  One, the invaders take over the natives and make the lands for themselves, or two, the natives push back the invaders and keep the lands for themselves.  So, with Gate: Jieitai Kanochi nite, Kaku Tatakaeri, or Gate: and so the JSDF fought there, alluding to that concept with Japan and another world, what are we to expect from this story?\r\nStory: Yoji Itami is your everyday average Otaku.  He likes Doujinshi, he has his own personal fetishes, and he likes online novels.  On the way to gobuy some Doujinshi, a Gate reminiscent to a roman structure opens up in the middle of the city, and all kinds of people, monsters, dragons, and militia barge in and begin slaughtering the innocent civilians.  With quick thinking, and the help of the military he contacted, Itami rushes to help with the situation where we discover that this guy is actually a pretty damn good soldier reaching the rank of First Lieutenant.  And so, with a mysterious gate that spawned creatures of fantasy existing in the middle of Japan, the government dispatches the JSDF to go in and discover what is on the other side of the Gate.  \\n\\n\r\nGate's story is very similar to the ideas of conquering a new land.  We have the invaders and the natives played by the JSDF and the Empire respectively, and we have to opposing sides that go to war (to some degree) and battle for control over certain areas.  However, rather than a full-on takeover, Gate focuses more on peaceful resolutions and a mix of cultures and knowledge amongst the two different peoples.  Rather than focusing more on the war side of politics, Gate puts most of its effort towards the idea of peace as throughout the entire anime there are talks of peace, sharing cultures and goods, as well as other political acts such as Diets, shifts of power, and well, war.  Because you can't have two opposing sides go against each other without war.    \\n\\n\r\nAside from the peace treaties, occasional war, and trade that goes on in the series, there's honestly not much to say beyond that.  Character development doesn't particularly exist in this anime as it is very much story-driven, and any sort of thing that seems like character development really only equates to \"Itami is a good guy.\"  Hell, those are the closing lines for the show.  In addition, some of the politics does get a bit messy halfway through the series.  A lot of things happen around the halfway to 2/3 mark of the series and it isn't...really all that clear.  A lot of events can happen in Gate at one time, and it ends up becoming rather confusing to watch simply because there is just so much going on.  \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Gate did succeed in what it wanted to tell, which was a story that focused on two different sides now coming together since there was a gate that allowed them to come in contact with one another.  What it didn't really do well on was the specifics on what it wanted to do.  Its somewhat poor execution was only heightened by the lackluster ending.  In all fairness, it was a very anticlimactic ending.  Nothing...really happened there and the luster of the series just sort of faded away.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Good base story idea\\n\r\n+ Decent plot and progression\\n\r\n-  Lackluster ending\\n\r\n-  Poor execution sometimes by jumbling a lot of stuff together at once \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: In addition, characters in Gate are good when looked at from face value, but they don't really hold much value in the long run.  \\n\\n\r\nUp first, there's Yoji Itami, the main protagonist of the series.  As a First Lieutenant of the JDSF army, Itami is a man who has control over an entire little squadron of characters.  Throughout the series, Itami is shown to be a rather lax man, wishing only to be one with his Otaku goods and not worrying about the going ons in politics and what have you.  But contrary to that, he is a very kind person, seeing that everyone who asks for help should get help and unwilling to back down whenever there is any immediate threat to the people he knows and loves.  But really, that's about it.  There isn't really any character development for Itami throughout the entire series.  He stays rather static with the role that he's given and really doesn't change at all.  In most cases, he acts a bit like a plot device because he's the one giving orders and the one that influences most of the characters in the series, while not really changing much as a character himself.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then we have the three title girls of the series.  Tuka, Lelei, and Rory.  Similar to Itami, these three girls don't really change much as the series goes on.  Static in their roles as sort of \"the last girl\" due to how Tuka comes in the series, \"the knowledgeable one\" on account of  Lelei's will for knowledge and ability to become a mediator/translator between the other world and Japan, and the \"fan favorite\" on account of Rory's rather...interesting personality.  (I relate her to Tokisaki Kurumi as a comparison, and a bit sad that Sanada Asami didn't get the role for Rory.  The parallels!!!)  They also don't show up as much as you would think, since there are times where we can basically go an entire episode without either one of these three saying any significant lines.  \\n\\n\r\nAs for side characters, Gate has a very expansive cast featuring characters from both sides that add to the complexity on the views on what is going on in the other world.  However, like always, there are some characters that get more screentime than most.  Most notably is the third princess of the empire, Pina Co Lada (I'm sorry, but...that name is hilarious.  She's a drink.), who spends the series learning about Japan and, like the JDSF, is shooting for peace.  Aside from her though, many other characters get shelved off into two separate categories.  Characters who actually involve themselves with the main characters on an episode by episode basis, such as Itami's unit, or just story fodder who serve to do nothing but try and build up the way the story works or what kind of people live in the world.  (Cause there are a surprising amount of non-humans.)  As a result, the story fodder is chock full of characters you really only meet once and is just a complicated way of saying that they're plot devices.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Rory\\n\r\n+ Some interesting characters\\n\r\n-  Little to none character progression\\n\r\n-  Expansive and completely forgettable side cast.  (They even had random operatives from the US, China, and Russia one time.  Come on, Gate.)\\n\\n\r\nArt: Produced by A-1 pictures, Gate has a rather high quality style of animation.  The colors that they use for the series features a rather bright color palette that gives off a very whimsical feel to the series, reminiscent of a magical world.  (Well, we are in a magical world.)  \\n\\n\r\nIn addition, the animation is very fluid and nicely detailed.  Any sort of action sequence that does not involve just complete modern warfare is very fluid in its motions (Particularly Rory and her massive halberd badassery), and the backgrounds and characters are very nicely detailed.  While there aren't any completely stunning scenes to make note of, the animation does stay very consistent throughout the whole runtime and doesn't fail to look good in any way.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ High quality animation\\n\r\n+ Fluid fight scenes\\n\r\n-  No real memorable moments in art\\n\\n\r\nSound: Gate's OP is a very peculiar piece to listen to.  It's unique in the sense that you can't really pin it down as a specific kind of track.  It's not heavy metal, it's not your general cutesy music, nor is it any sort of epic war song.  It's a sort of mixture of rock music with a little whimsy, and some war song-like attributes, particularly one that sort of boosts morale.  Oddly enough though, it doesn't go to the extent of being memorable.  That being said though, it is still a decent track and one worth listening to.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending on the other hand is similar to a very cutesy song.  The three VA's who voice Tuka, Lelei, and Rory sing the song, and it honestly isn't really all that memorable.  There isn't anything about it that screams as a track that's memorable.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Unique OP\\n\r\n-  Mediocre ED\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: While Gate had more than a couple problems with its execution, it was still a rather enjoyable show.  It reminded me of a more serious version of a similar show called \"Outbreak Company\" where we have an Otaku placed in a magical world.  \\n\\n\r\nDid I like this show?\\n\\n\r\nIndeed, I did.  Because the show was mostly story based, there were moments where I was completely enthralled by what was going on and was greatly anticipating the next episode.  The concept of the show intrigued me and I thoroughly enjoyed that initial battle scene.  (The slaughter was funny.)  Also Rory.  Rory is a fantastic character and probably the fan favorite for the entire series.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this show?\\n\\n\r\nGate had some very obvious problems with its execution.  As it didn't focus on characters, everyone was rather one sided in terms of personality.  In addition, the politics were confusing to me when they began bombarding us with country interactions, and the series just sort of...ending with that anticlimactic ending really didn't do any justice for the series.  \\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this series?  \\n\\n\r\nIf you're a fan of war-related anime or any kind of fantasy anime, then Gate would be good series to watch.  While there are problems with the way the story is made because of its severely down moments and its less than phenomenal character development, it does have enough to it to make it an enjoyable show.  Plus, you get to see like a dozen people take down a freaking dragon.  That's pretty badass.",

            "content": "Is this anime perfect? no, not by a long shot. But is it entertaining? Oh yes, yes it is. Sure it paints an incredibly rosy picture of the Japanese military, but while it would have made things a lot more interresting if there were a few bad apples within the organization, it was kinda nice to have whole host of good guys to root for as they help out various locals in this new world they find themselves in.\r\nI quite enjoyed it, but be warned that the second season is best skipped and ignored.\r\nHowever if you do stick solely with the first season, you'll finda fun little fantasy story with lots of comedy and fun times. However for all that the main character is giant dork and his team of misfits are equally entertaining and endearing in their own way, there are darker moments. If you are squeamish about bloood, and death you may want to steer clear, as there is more than one massacre and plenty of innocent background characters adults and children alike, are brutally killed by soldeirs, dragons or other. \\n\r\nThere is drama and action and great animation to be had, but what kept me was the humor.\\n\\n\r\nPlot Summary: When a large gate shaped portal appears in Japan, a city is attacked by mideival soldiers and beasts from another world. In the aftermath of this tragedy, the military is sent to investigate what lies beyond the portal, repel any further invaders, ideally broker a peace agreement, and maybe even secure new and rare resources for Japan. \\n\r\nThus Otaku soldier Itami's plans for chilling out with his doujinshi are dashed, as he is dragged into battle and adventure.\\n\\n\r\nThere's also some awesome female characters, though season two manages to turn them into shells of themselves as they fall into the fetish pandering they were mangaging to sidestep in this one. (also season two feature rape and other gross themes. But those issues thankfully don't plague this first season.)\\n\\n\r\nAnyway season one is good for a laugh and is actually fairly engaging when it wants to be.",

They plan on using the foot hold they have on the other side of gate (dubbed \"The Special Region\") to find resources, while also trying to handle the aggressive Empire on the other side.(though the Empire is like a Chihuahua, small, not dangerous, very annoying, and easily kicked out of the way)\r\nArt:\r\nGeneric 2010's anime art style with a wide color pallet used. The military vehicles are very well modeled (They had a japanese Type 74 MBT and it looked spot on)\r\nSounds;\r\nFromthe yells of the people to the explosion of a 81mm mortar hitting the ground are all done well and the dub is great. They even used Ride of the Valkyrie, in easily one of the best scenes in the first season.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Rather Generic with a twist\\n\\n\r\nY\u014dji Itami - That dude who's appearently in the Army/Rangers/Special Forces Because he's so great at avoiding work while being a Otaku he was able to get into these positions(somehow) He is a gental guy who looks after not only his own but the people in the special region.\\n\\n\r\nRory Mercury - A Demi god blah blah blah, she looks like a 12 year old goth lolita in a maid outfit, who has a thing for death and Itami. (nuff said)\\n\\n\r\nLelei La Lalena - A wizard girl in training and she grips the japanese langauge and how to use modern tech extremely quickly. Shes on the quiet said though she is not shy or afraid to voice her opinions.\\n\\n\r\nTuka Luna Marceau - An elf girl who was brought in to Itamis care after an unfortunate incident. Shes very nice and a blonde with big boobs. (with a few problems becasue of the incident)\\n\\n\r\nPi\u00f1a Co Lada - Yes. Pi\u00f1a Co Lada her name is a bloody drink. Whoever made her name must have been drinking heavily when naming her. She's the Princess of the empire and a proud warrior who wasnt actually fought. (till now)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI loved this anime for one reason. Watching Attack Choppers mow down bandits who are using bows and swords. The reactions from the people on the other side of the gate is hilarious. Everytime it JSDF vs well anything they just annihlate. Its amazing, funny, the lol's go everywhere. The only things that really let down the anime is the focus of the evil foreign nations wanting access to the gate and how it pops up far to often. (like who gives a crap i wanna see tanks roll up into an enemy position and blast them away.) I honestly couldnt get enough of the power difference. However by the mid point of the anime it starts to decline and we see less and less JSDF in action.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\r\nIf you like the military this anime will have you laughing and youll love it. If you dont like the military and want to see more adventure look else where.(though there is some adventuring its in an APC and only on the first few episodes) This is a Must Watch.",

            "content": "Despite it being half season, Gate was pretty entertaining to me. Although it did resemble Outbreak Company on a suspicious scale. (Like SAO and Log Horizon).\r\nBtw, since I'm lazy af, this review is for both S1 and S2. Seperating them and reviewing them 1 by 1 would be a pain and I have anime to watch.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nWithout spoilers, a summary is, Gate opens in Japan, JSDF go in and start a relationship with the people there, people fight, JSDF to advanced, massacre, good relations, the end. The story itself is never completed, but ends off in a not completely off the cliff manner and wasacceptable.\\n\\n\r\nI also forgot but MAL doesn't have a Setting Section, so I'll add it here.\\n\\n\r\nSetting: 6.5/10\\n\r\nThe setting was definitely out of the ordinary except company outbreak had THE EXACT SAME SETTING and it came out 2 years before this. But the setting did intrigue me as the details and origin of the Gate converged with the story, but that question was never truly answered.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nThe art was fair. Pretty standard for an anime of its year. The color scheme was good, but not exactly good enough to stand out to me after all the other colorsplosion anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nAgain, alright sound, the OP's were nothing special, and if anything, the sound was about as good as it could get without over achieving.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nCharacter development for each character was different, but there was depth to the character and you could really see some of them change as the story progressed. It was pretty nice.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nA good show to watch. It can reach quite high, but if you just finished a really high level anime, then this one may not reach the bar you set for yourself. Otherwise, this is a pretty much must watch as the anime that come out after this, is on a steady downhill on the enjoyment scale.\\n\\n\r\nKawaiiKamiKait Grade: B+",

            "content": "GATE is the quintessence of parody, everything from the main characters to the universe beyond the gate and the story is exagerated. Here we see the Japanese SDF as the invading \"barbarians\" of the Empire that ressemble a lot to the ancient roman Empire who was also destroyed in 476 by barbarians (I simplify it, it's actually more complexe than that). I believe that the world beyond the gate is actually a copy of the 'real world', there is many details in the background to make me think that but I'll let you watch it so that you can understanding it. Not only that butthe modern Japanese society is also exagerated, Itami being an Otaku and having a bad reputation before being enlisted in the JSDF, and throught it the entire modern societies. \\n\\n\r\nOn a technical point of view, the sound is very good especially for the modern weaponry, its even a breaking barrier with the fatansy world beyond the gate since it makes it even more realistic, a rifle will have the same sound as one in real life, same for the mortar or artillery. The art is simple, almost clich\u00e9 in some of the character designs wich only help for the parody. The action is also well paced with 10 minutes of fighting and then move to a diplomatic or political situation with more dialogues or exploration. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give it a 9 because I think some characters and relations should have been more developped, it's still very enjoyable and it's in my toplist of animes. Thus, I'll recommend to not take it seriously when you're watching it and think of it as a parody above else.",

            "content": "Gate: Jietai has been on my list for a while since last year, and I have the thought of thinking, \"Anything that has another season should be pretty good\", though, there was that one time it failed me, but I digress. Gate: Jietai offers an interesting premise from the get go - clash of modern and fantasy-medieval, and the main character is not some teenager. Be warned: this review is very, very long.\r\nThe plot of the anime is not expanded enough in season 1. While all of the episodes are linked towards each other (and a cliffhanger at the end of episode 12  forseason 2 to follow up), it does not show a clear way towards the determined plot, and most of the time Gate: Jietai sinks into comedy amidst its seriousness. The unique story of modern world versus fantasy-medieval piqued my interest all the time, though apart from that, it does not do well. The episodes are well laid out with parts that have slow pacing. There is a fanservice episode at episode 9 along with an unrealistic event, to my opinion, and what amuses me is the use of Fate references in that episode. I believe certain parts of the anime, especially regarding the interference of other countries, are exaggerated. This will be said more in the characters part next. They have portrayed no sexism in army, which gives a plus point in my book.\\n\\n\r\nI applaud Gate: Jietai for making the other world speaking in another language apart of Japanese in the other world, though that quickly falls apart as they only make one sentence out of it, and the rest of the words are replaced with Japanese. It was amusing to see that a character was clearly speaking Japanese yet the soldiers have no clue what they were speaking of (despite their main language is Japanese itself) as they alter between the \"other language\" and Japanese. It would be nice to see them forming a new language and use it often, and not altering between one and another once a while. Another thing I find weird is the fact that almost every relevant characters hails MC (Yoji Itami) as the \"savior of the other side\", which will also be expanded at the character part. Kindness and trust seems to be an overused thing in Gate: Jietai despite taking place in war. What are the odds for a fearsome army to gain trust without the villagers or townsfolk shaking in fear to their request? Why are most seemingly important characters female? I should keep it in mind that it is only an anime.\\n\\n\r\nMost characters in Gate: Jietai have a rather realistic approach (each to their own worlds), but some of their actions are over-exaggerated, particularly the other countries' responses to the appearance of Gate in Japan. The antagonists of the anime, leaders of three different countries, wants a piece of the Gate of themselves, but what they do to have that piece is seemingly exaggerated and poor planning, making their character plain and a foil for Japan. Propaganda? Perhaps, but I am rather lacking to the topic. Then we have Yoji Itami who might seem plain, but he has the main character status. He has the girls, the skills, the brains, and he is also an Otaku. What a coincidence that he is also lazy! Gate: Jietai seems to glorify Otaku for having the MC and someone important to the country an Otaku, but I digress. Yoji Itami is perhaps the weirdest MC I have seen. I quote from him, \"I work to support my hobby. So if you ask which I'd choose, my job or my hobby, my hobby takes priority.\" We know that he is a part of the Self Defense Force (SDF) and his hobby is... anime, manga, doujinshi, I suppose. Why would an Otaku pick to be in the army to support their hobby? They have a higher chance of getting injured, needs a lot of work to be fit for the job, and usually don't have the time off for anything else. Maybe it was the pay that attracted him to be in SDF. \\n\\n\r\nThat was a lot about him, so we'll move forward. None of the characters have actually grown, but there are a mutual understanding between the two worlds, though the language barrier remains standing, an odd thing to have since the residence of the other world can speak more Japanese than them speaking more of their \"other language\", but that might be due to Japan being the main control for having modern technology than them. The other supposedly \"main characters\" of the other world are a part of the harem of Yoji Itami. Supposedly SDF is a fearsome army, yet most other world characters are not afraid of them because they are \"kind\", \"strong\" and \"trustworthy\". The only characters that correctly portrays how they should react to Japan's soldiers are the Princess and her knights, but towards the end of the season they are okay with each other. I am surprise that they praise a lot to SDF and not wondering of the consequences if the soldiers were to make a move and conquer them, especially when they have little to no knowledge of the other world. I understand that they have helped them, but there wasn't any people, or a small group, that despises their existence out of fear of their power. This is too good to be at a war ground where blood spills as easily as to knock over a glass of water at the edge of a counter. The amount of trust and kindness in the anime is too high.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style of the anime is well done. I like the portrayal of wrinkles in the character's faces wherever applicable. Sometimes the anime slips into 3D animation, to which I still am not too fond of.  They are easy to spot but it is decently made. It is extremely easy to detect moderate to important characters of the other world as their hair color, clothing, and distinct appearance traits would give away. The important character designs seems to appeal more towards fantasy lovers (e.g. elves and cat ears) and males with the showing of cleavage in some of the female armors and maid outfits. I would like to take the advantage to say that a priestess's clothes should not be what it is shown in Gate: Jietai. It is impractical, unrealistic, and too influence to the modern world they have yet to be influenced. But it's an anime, right? The background of the anime seems rather flat with colors. It is not the best, but it is good enough.\\n\\n\r\nGate: Jietai's OP does not fit to the tone of the anime as they are flat, and the singer's voice seem to drown in the sounds of instruments. They are not catchy enough to my taste. I skipped the ED so I have no comments about that. It is odd to find Japanese seiyuu voicing over other countrymen, but apart of that they are fine. Reaper's voice does not seem to fit her well in portrayal of a child-like appearance to my opinion. I am unsure of the presence of soundtracks inside the anime as I have a tendency to ignore them, but there is a cue to a soundtrack in episode 6, which I think they have done a great job with, though it does feel off as the soldiers require songs to be pumped up. I have no experience in military, so that is solely my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment with Gate: Jietai is decent, though sometimes it does bug me regarding the main character who seems to be almost perfect to be real (an irony, I realize) yet the only negative thing about him seems to be being an Otaku. While there are things here and there I could relate to, but some of its exaggeration, whether for drama purposes or heighten up the show, that quickly follows after it detaches me from feeling the same as before. The first episode gave a good impression along with its half-hearted comedy that more or less gave me a smile. The anime have, whether purposely or accidentally, glorify the soldiers of Japan and justify killing of others (though they are enemies, even so there was no clear purpose of their attacks, for \"plot purposes\" again I suppose. It was shown that they could have a peace talk against one another, though when it faces the seemingly antagonistic characters that are just there for a moment, they don't have any discussions). The exaggeration of the other countries' reactions towards the Gate slightly downgraded their appearance when compared to Japan's forces. I understand that this is a work of fiction, but the fact that they somewhat intersect between our world (or rather, Japan) creates a relationship between our world and the world in the anime albeit loosely tied makes them seemingly poor contrasted to Japan.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I am curious of how it would turn out in season 2, as mentioned before, Gate: Jietai left a small suspense for it's next season to follow up to it. I have a hard time determining whether it was slightly above average or good, but at the end I would say this is an enjoyable anime, credit to its unique story of mixing reality with fantasy through a portal. My review may be slightly bias due to thoughts of peacemaking methods and having no experience in war or warfare, but there are definitely bits here and there in the anime makes me raise an eyebrow of the situations. This anime portrays a poor way of mixing comedy into war-like situation, as it takes away its seriousness that was created just a while ago. The overly \"kind\" and \"trust\" thing used in the anime draws a fine line between our world and the world beyond the screen. If you are looking for a serious anime regarding war, sadly to say I must say that this is not what you are looking for.",

It was refreshing to see a lot of connections to our daily lives as well as new things that not all of us experience combined into a fantasy/new world story line. It throws small chips of comedy into some of the harsher realities of military work (obviously not all are correct butyou get what I mean). The art was very well done with scenes ranging from lush new scenery to old, down-to-earth human lifestyle art.\\n\r\nThe music was a nice combination of emotion-evoking but not quite as strong as certain anime. However thanks to the plot not being a drama, strong music isn't quite as necessary anyways (I'm pretty sure saying that isn't a spoiler lol). The characters introduced were superbly well crafted, bringing a blend of new personalities along with the generic, run-of-the-mill ones. Overall I enjoyed watching this anime. It was plain enough to understand and enjoy but offered some in-depth ideas. With new characters, an interesting plot-line and simply eye-catching art, this anime left me wanted a second season. I hope you watch it and enjoy!",

            "content": "This review is extremely light on spoilers...barely mentioning the basic premise of the anime, which itself is spoiled in the synopsis on the main anime page. This review assumes you have already read it. \r\nStory: 9/10\r\n-\r\nThe plot itself is not particularly groundbreaking. Where most of my admiration from the story comes from is the focus on the political and military aspects of not only the conflicts between Japan and the world within the Gate, but also the political pressure of the rest of the world towards Japan's monopolized control of the Gate. The plot is simple but it is executed with such realistic progression thatit feels very refreshing compared to the all-too-common story where we remind ourselves in the back of our heads that the events that unfolded would not have done so in a paralleled real life experience. Everything is very well-researched and carefully considered in terms of the story.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nI was immediately struck by the simple and effective art style in the very first scene. The colors are sharp and vibrant and the detail in scenery is quite good. Characters appear neither bland nor outlandish (in general; those that are outlandish have a legitimate basis to be as such). All in all, no real criticism of the art. If there is a reason that I did not give the art a 10/10 score, it's just that I feel a 10/10 score is not to be given lightly. Lacking room for criticism doesn't necessarily denote perfection.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nDisclaimer: I don't particularly pay attention to the music or sound effects of an anime. Some anime do stand out to me in their music or opening themes; most do not. Gate's did not stand out to me. But I admit that I was not particularly listening for it. As for the voice acting - serviceable? I wasn't particularly impressed but I wasn't disappointed, either. It was good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nThe cast of characters for Gate is expansive both in its number of characters as well as the depth to each character. With the exception of a couple, it doesn't feel as though many characters were written solely to serve a particular function in the plot (i.e comedic relief, love interest, exposition, etc). Unlike many anime with a wide cast of characters, Gate also finds a reasonable balance of airtime between the main characters and side characters despite there being so many side characters. Nearly every character exhibits some depth. Visually, the characters are easily distinguishable and have their personalities mostly reflected somehow in their appearance.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nThe politically-inclined story and the personable characters makes for an exciting anime. I think that there is a little bit of everything for everyone. Romance, comedy, fanservice, tragedy, action, guns, magic, dragons, tanks...\\n\\n\r\nSince I mentioned it: there is not very much fanservice, if that turns you off from an anime. It isn't exactly minimal, either, though. It's just enough to titillate the perverted while sparse enough not to try the patience of the prudish.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nI was impressed with this anime quite a bit. Definitely worth a watch.",

I overral really enjoyed the anime and here's is why I gave it the score that I did.\r\nGate does characterisation of the characters by giving a bit of back story later in the series with just overall good character development and design. What I found most unique about Gate is that the story is very orriginal and leans away from other types of military anime and appropriately situates any comedy so that it is not to ruin the overall atmosphere andfeel created by the story. The art style wasn't very disinguishable from other anime titles but Gate still looked very pretty. The setting of the anime is used in other types of anime but what makes Gate different from them is that it's a mix. You have the modern world of today and the medieval RPG styled world, and A-1 Pictures mixes them together flawlessly to give you the best of both worlds.\\n\\n\r\nFinal thoughts: this anime was extremely enjoyable to me and I would highly recomend this anime to anyone who is into the Military Genre or who would just enjoy a unique type of anime once in a while. I would definitly recommend it to my friends and it will definitly be worth a rewatch after some time. I have high hopes for the seconds season.",

If you are looking for an anime that blends military and fantasy almost PERFECTLY, this is it.\r\nyet it have its own flaws and greatness.\r\n(just finished the second season)\r\nLets take a look at this VERY SHORT review.\r\nLet's start with MC.. He is skilful. Not the usual laidback personality and not simply a manifestation of brute force. He act when needed and does thing correctly yet he is not a serious person and NOT THE USUAL PERVERT MC.\r\nSoundtrack: A good try I said. But there isstill room. Especially when there is an air raid and they use Raid of Valkyrie as a background music.. A common classical piece. They try to copy that one movie but I forgot its name. \\n\\n\r\nScenery: A1 studio really put their effort into this anime cause we can see the glittering atmosphere, shiny sky, yet vast and empty world consume in the darkness blend splendidly together to create a truly magical atmosphere. \\n\\n\\n\r\nStory line: Put it simply, you might have that feeling of Log horizon. There is character development and stuff. and the most important thing: PLOT. Yes, they have it. You can see the story shifting smoothly one arc after another with a logical continuation inserted with light humour now and then. \\n\\n\r\nDespite the existence of many women(Girls, elf, demigod loli, whatev) There is not an obvious smell of harem going on.

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nThe progression of weaponry is pretty astounding. As Neanderthals, we started off with nothing more than blunt sticks and sharp stones. Eventually we learned about the oddity called the \u201cbow and arrow.\u201d From there, we melted iron to make knives, swords, and javelins. Then came the gun. Then the tank. Then the jet, the submarine, and the almighty nuke. In a relatively short amount of time, humanity has proven their penchant for new ways of killing each other.\r\nGATE: Thus the JSDF Fought There!, while not really about the weapons, showcases a wide range of them,from the bow to the gun to the fighter jet. Of course, given the mythical setting, other forms of weaponry exist, such as magic and massive death axes.\\n\\n\r\nAnd so this makes me wonder something: where will our weaponry be ten years from now? Or in one hundred years? Will we go the Star Wars route, with light-sabers and laser-blasters? Or will we instead come up with a piece of technology that we currently cannot comprehend? At the minimum, I hope there is not an alien species out there looking to invade us with such technology, because as GATE depicts, an assault rifle beats a sword any day of the week.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nGATE is Japanese propaganda incarnate.\\n\\n\r\nThe Japanese army is intelligent, strong, and merciful. At every possible turn, the Japanese army is placed in a supremely positive light. One second they are creating a brand new village for the other-worldly denizens to inhabit, and the next second has them defeating the American CIA and other foreign intelligence agencies simultaneously.GATE even has blatant examples: at one point, Bozes exclaims (conveniently enough, at the camera), \u201cSplendid! How does Japan elevate even the smallest dishes into works of art?\u201d One does not get more patriotic than that.\\n\\n\r\nDo not be mistaken. This is not a negative. In fact, this is quite the positive. Part of what GATE wants to accomplish is highlighting the disparity between Japan (who represents the normal world) and the Empire (the new world). So, the anime does what one calls \u201chitting two birds with one stone.\u201d By placing Japan on a pedestal, not only does the show makes its own country look nice but it also achieves the stark contrast it had in mind from the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nNot looking at the more meta aspect of the show, narratively GATE is pretty simple, clich\u00e9 even. A portal \u2013 a gate \u2013 opens up to a world filled with cat people, medieval governments, and dragons. People exploring an untapped world is nothing new, though the way in which GATE approaches the concept is slightly different.\\n\\n\r\nThe narrative has some focus on conquering and murder. A giant, fire-breathing dragon decimating an entire clan of elves and the prospect of rape should the battle be lost are parts of war that are definitely present. But what the narrative mainly focuses on is the \u201cgentler\u201d, the more civil side of war. Saving civilians, diplomatic exchanges, summits between the warring states, the formation of alliances, and paying respects to the dead. Again, the anime does this partly to put Japan in a favorable light but also partly to showcase that war is not constant death, destruction, and despair. That despite the atrocities war brings, people still try to find the silver linings.\\n\\n\r\nInterestingly, one of the anime\u2019s weakest aspects is the world-building. Yes, the show gives small details in regards to Rory\u2019s religion, how their senate works, and the names of various locations. Yet, the Empire, this brand new and almost unbelievable world, never feels like a world. Civilian interaction is rarely shown. Magic is hardly talked about. The differences between a regular elf and a dark elf are not discussed. These and other details are admittedly small, but they add up quickly.\\n\\n\r\nSo quickly, in fact, that the show seems to (once again) favor showing the normal world more so than the new world. In a show about this new world and the differences between it and what people are used to, ignoring the world-building is a blunder. Though there is a trade-off: GATE regularly shows its new world characters \u2013 Tuka Luna, Pi\u00f1a, Rory, and so on \u2013 in the normal world. Rory getting scared on the subway or Pi\u00f1a appreciating \u201cart\u201d get back at the disparity that the anime had always been striving for.\\n\\n\r\nA problem that GATE has that is difficult to explain away is its tendency for sexual content. For instance, the show relies one-too-many times on the \u201ca female should offer her body as payment or apology\u201d card. This prevalence of sex \u2013 be it Rory\u2019s advances or dressing up the women at a local mall \u2013 does not fit among the war, politics, and action taking place, no matter how appealing Tuka Luna looks in fashionable clothes.\\n\\n\r\nBut to be fair, GATE is not that concerned about anything else other than the cute, otherworldly women and the Japanese propaganda motif. In other words, the anime does not have much of a thematic presence. And for what the show is \u2013 an action anime blending the old and the new, the regular and the magical \u2013 it does not have to be much more than that.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nGATE does this weird, but welcome, thing with the presentation of some of its scenes. Usually when a pair of characters are speaking or the show wants to depict multiple, previous scenes simultaneously, the anime goes into panel mode. Four square panels, two rectangular ones, etcetera. This accomplishes a lot at once. One, the audience gets a clear view of the speakers talking to one another, giving the anime more chances to show off its art. Two, the presentation feels like a newspaper sharing today\u2019s news. Given the military motif, presenting the anime as if it were some daily news feels right at home. Three, lastly, and most importantly, the paneling creates that sense of disparity. Seeing Itami and Pi\u00f1a on opposite sides of the screen at the same time is a nice and easy way to showcase the contrast between the normal and the new worlds.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the rest of the art, the anime \u2013 due to focusing more on the normal world \u2013 has lush scenery replaced with skyscrapers and military outposts. Besides a castle, a makeshift town, and some country roads, the Empire is not shown all that much, contributing to that missing world-building feel.\\n\\n\r\nWhere GATE shines brightest are its character designs which do feel as if they come from an alternate world. Yao Ha Ducy\u2019s caramel-colored skin, white hair, and yellow eyes make her out to be the exotic beauty that she is. The elvish Tuka Luna in modern clothes achieves more disparity. Rory dons her signature black-and-magenta dress. Lelei\u2019s blue and pale-green design match her cool, unemotional approach to life. In (nice) contrast, Itami, Shino, and the other JSDF members are given seemingly plain designs. Though in this context, \u201cnormal\u201d works better than \u201cplain\u201d because the whole point is that the new world is different. So, though normal, these designs contrast with the gaudier ones, continuing GATE\u2019s focus on disparity.\\n\\n\r\nActual animation remains relatively high throughout the season. Eye and hair movement is present, as are subtler animated sequences such as a floating water bubble and slaps to the face. Given the constant military action involving tanks, guns, and jets, the characters moving around in a believable manner was a nice sight to see.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of GATE is huge, but that is somewhat to be expected when two contrasting countries go to war with one another.\\n\\n\r\nAt the forefront is Itami who, unfortunately, is handled poorly. In the beginning, he is characterized as a hobbyist, or colloquially an \u201cotaku.\u201d He loves anime, manga, and doing as little as possible. Circumstances force his hand, earning him a promotion and, consequently, some loathing for the situation he is placed in. So at the start, Itami is not a man with a mission but instead a man looking to avoid as many missions as possible.\\n\\n\r\nThen the show starts to get underway. At this point, Itami becomes the self-inserting character he was destined to be. He is very kind to everyone, no matter what. He always chooses the best, most positive route to solve the problems at hand. And, of course, he is surrounded by beautiful women. When the anime starts taking this direction for his character, for whatever reason the show forgets about his earlier characterization. It is alluded to occasionally \u2013 his buddy who is also a fan of anime and manga plays the role of \u201cremind the audience that Itami loves this stuff, too\u201d \u2013 but the frequency is so low that one does not associate his character with the traits he supposedly had in the beginning. The result is that Itami\u2019s character starts to make less sense the more GATE progresses.\\n\\n\r\nNowhere is this more apparent than with his ex-wife, Risa Aoi. She is a paltry addition to the cast but she ruins Itami\u2019s character further. Risa argues that Itami does not understand what truly matters. For him, he was seemingly oblivious to Risa\u2019s feelings when they got married. He decided that the \u201cinsurance money\u201d would cover her if anything ever happened to him; not the most husbandly thing to say. This is peculiar because Itami does seem to understand what matters most. He is a celebrated soldier, he has his heart in the right place when dealing with others, and he still supports and cares for Risa. Most contradictory of all is his stance on Tuka Luna. He does not find it wise to force her out of her delusions since they cannot \u201cbe her pillars of support forever.\u201d That is quite the mature and understanding thing to say. Altogether, GATE definitely tries to make his character deeper than what he appears to be, but fails in doing so.\\n\\n\r\nNow, there are a few counter arguments. Itami\u2019s words on Tuka Luna can be seen as wrong, not caring. Not helping the woman to get better and basically ignoring the problem is not that caring of a decision. His love of anime-related material over practically anything else, while not as prevalent of an idea, is yet another trait of his that makes him presumably out-of-touch. Or this has nothing to do with Itami and everything to do with Risa. Perhaps she misconstrued what he meant in the sense that he wanted to support her in the only way he knew how. If Itami is not as contradictory as Risa makes him out to be, that is a step in the right direction. Yet that would still leave him as the same, kindhearted Itami; a stale character.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters are just as subpar. Starting with Lelei, she is arguably the worst. She is a pupil in the art of magic and she seems to have an intriguing background based on her nomadic lifestyle, but the anime never goes into her past. She is quickly pushed into an interpreter role, after which she does little else. Tuka Luna is nearly the same. Besides the death of her father affecting her both emotionally and mentally, she barely has a place in GATE\u2019s first season. In fact, after she is integrated into the JSDF, she is nearly forgotten about entirely. Even Rory, the girl that the anime puts on a pedestal, is not without faults. Her religion and demigod status are talked about in passing, but like many of the characters, barely anything else is known about her. She is around more than the others, so the viewer gets to see many more sides to her: her playfulness, her craziness, her logicalness, and so on. Still, she is not terribly complex since the anime was more concerned with having her orgasm on the battlefield as opposed to expounding her person.\\n\\n\r\nPi\u00f1a is by far the best written character of GATE, though that is not saying much. Her own past is divulged and she actually has a presence throughout the season. She, more than anyone, represents the Empire. She acts as the mediator, she has political connections with her own people, and her status as both a princess and as a leader make her more well-rounded as a character. While she does not change much, she at least has a better foundation than the rest of the side cast.\\n\\n\r\nFor all of the characters, one has to concede that this is just the first half to GATE (after it was supposedly meant to run as a full-cour as opposed to a split-cour). Meaning, some leniency should be applied since it is expected that the direct continuation will explore everyone more. Though given that the setup for many of the characters fell flat, it is difficult to justify the overall poor execution completely.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme for GATE follows that nationalistic feel. It is empowering, the final choir and surprisingly uplifting vocalist filling the listener with adrenaline. While not necessarily a militaristic song, the instruments \u2013 especially the resounding drums \u2013 give the track a lot of impact. If nothing else, the song is fun to listen to, matching the entertainment that the anime usually strives for.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending theme, on the other hand, is off-putting. Almost disco in presentation, the combination of techno, funky beat, and strange sound-effects hardly has a place amongst the military and medieval motifs. Now, that is not to say that the ED is poorly executed. Switching the vocalists is a nice touch. The song, despite its feel, is relaxing. And the repetition in some of the lyrics makes the track fun to (try to) sing along with. So, while the ED is sorely out-of-place, it still manages to be a well-crafted song.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting performances in GATE are likewise well-done. Risa Taneda as Rory gives the overtly sexual woman quite the sensual voice. Haruka Tomatsu as Pi\u00f1a gives the tomboy more of a husky voice that fits the warrior without taking away from her princess vibe. Nao Touyama as Lelei is as nonchalant-sounding as possible. And Junichi Suwabe as Itami, while not particularly noteworthy, uses a laidback voice that fits the character well-enough.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the rest of the original soundtrack is filled with both fantastical and militaristic pieces. Bells and drums for nighttime raids. Violins and trumpets for passing moments of tension. Cultural ensembles for that foreign feel. While the OST is nothing impressive, these tracks, alongside the other orchestral and village tracks, create the right atmosphere for GATE throughout the season.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nAfter getting through this one, I cannot say I hate it, but I cannot I say I like it, either.\\n\\n\r\nMy favorites in the show were easily Yao Ha Ducy and Tuka Luna, though that is my libido talking more so than my brain. I also got a kick out of Pi\u00f1a and Bozes, their antics and fascination with the normal world bringing about some funny scenes. Pi\u00f1a\u2019s constant confusion of which world was which also had me chuckling. Lelei could be funny, too, especially when the anime used her for her deadpan delivery and for her \u201c\u2026she says\u201d interpreter interjection.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Rory, I am split (here, my brain beats my libido). On the one hand, I find her annoying. I cannot take her evilness seriously and her ridiculous laughing gets on my nerves. That is sort of the point \u2013 the dichotomy of her psychotic and attractive qualities is meant to be alluring to the audience. On the other hand, she has some nice moments, such as at the summit where she puts the irritating speaker in her place or when she attempts to seduce Itami at the retreat. So Rory can be fun, but if I had to choose between her and Yao Ha Ducy, I would pick the dark elf every single time.\\n\\n\r\nThe action as well was not that captivating. This mostly comes down to the problem of gun-centric skirmishes not being all that fun to watch since not a whole lot happens when two or more people are fighting with guns. The JSDF versus the fire dragon was about as cool as it got action-wise, but even then watching bullets and rockets take down a massive, flying beast was not that entertaining. I got a lot more joy out of the simpler, slice-of-life moments. The small stuff like Risa pinpointing Itami\u2019s tastes in the getaway van and Yao Ha Ducy mistakenly excited to be taken in for questioning. These moments had nothing to do with the military action, but they were the ones that I found most entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nWhen the anime was not focusing on the women or the action, everything else was moderately engaging despite the show dabbling in both comedy and drama. Specific scenes, such as Rory feigning innocence when she meets Yao Ha Ducy for the first time or during the battle of Italica when the helicopters were approaching to the tune of \u201cRide of the Valkyries,\u201d are ones that made the show at least somewhat interesting. But the majority of the time, the content of the anime made me feel, like I do towards Rory, ambivalent.\\n\\n\r\nGATE: Thus the JSDF Fought There! does not do a whole lot, at least in this opening act. The lack of proper world-building, the lame characters, and the infrequent engaging content do more harm than good. Yet the paneling and the flavorful sound make up for some of these issues. To put it metaphorically, this first half is a dull blade: it works, but it could work better.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, Japanese propaganda leads to disparity and fun, yet the lack of world-building and unnecessary sexual content are notable problems\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Good, cool paneling technique, okay art, nice character designs, above average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Bad, Itami is a subpar main protagonist, Lelei, Tuka Luna, and Rory are subpar side characters, with only Pi\u00f1a having strength\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, good OP, okay ED, okay OST, above average VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Fine, Yao Ha Ducy and Tuka Luna need more screen-time, some fun and interesting moments exist, but Rory\u2019s presence can get grating and not every sequence is entertaining\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 5/10",

            "content": "Gate: Jieitai Kanochi nite, Kaku Tatakaeri is one heck of an anime and manga.  Having read and watched both I can say the series is quite interesting and for those of you just watching the anime, the series will have more big story defining events happen in the future.\r\nHowever for the show's plot itself at least at present (cause it could always pick up in the future) is rather dull, a lack of a clear and threatening enemy grinds the concept of the show to quite a halt.  Yes there are plenty of times where the JSDF finds a purpose to use itsoverwhelming firepower over its mid-evil enemies and environment and at times finding themselves wanting to go out and shoot up a dragon that's burning villages to the ground.  But politics loves nothing more than getting in the way of such actions.\\n\\n\r\nBut concerning the plot, it does evolve, but over the past few episodes nothing overly significant in terms of progression towards what people could call an \"End\" to the story.  The story seems to find excuses to perpetuate the story further with small but not always insignificant events.  Such as Itami and company's visit to Japan due to a summoning by the Japanese DIET, or their prolonged political battle for a peace process with an empire that takes much of the same mentality as the Roman Empire.  Not an easy or quick task to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nHowever despite the dullness of the story thus far it has HUGE potential.  (and don't get me wrong I love watching political debates, political blackmail, and black op events stir up emotional results but when that's the most tense action you see it's difficult to keep excited about the story).  Japan at present is the only country with access to this world at least at present, it's always possible that other countries including but not limited to the US, Russia and China could also find access to this world through their countries.  Or possibly other worlds with similar, or even much more advanced technology or magical abilities could also open up.\\n\\n\r\nBut getting outside the big \"What ifs\" of this story's potential, the world called the \"Special Region\" of Japan so far has only 1 outpost for the JSDF and their exploration of this world is so far quite limited only operating within one country the Empire that attacked Japan through that Gate that appeared in Ginza (creating the \"Ginza Incident\").  Thus the JSDF is rather reluctant to go outside the Empire's borders and many other countries and races exist beyond the empire.  So in short there is still a huge world out there that has yet to be explored.\\n\\n\r\nThe political side to the story takes a very dark turn turning into what others have also criticized the story on being a purely \"Good vs. Evil\" with no in between.  Having the JSDF being the unbending and ever noble good guys while every other entity has proven themselves to be sketchy at least or out right obnoxious at worst.  Even the Big 3 countries US China and Russia also earn their place in this with the Chinese expressing that they want to take the special region so they can relocate millions of people there.  The US president wanting to annex the region for its resources potential.  Russia hasn't expressed anything directly yet but has participated in trying under handed tactics much like the US and China.  But the US earned a special place in this story by resorting to Blackmailing the Japanese Prime Minister to try and abduct the Emissaries from the \"Special Region\".  China and Russia tried the same thing at the same time minus the black mail which ended up the special agents from all three countries wiping each other out with Rory's help.\\n\\n\r\nNot much can be said about artwork other than it's AMAZING.  Beautiful and vibrant colours and not short in detail when designing either world.  While Japan does take a slightly more dull environment colouring and brightness unlike the fantasy world I'm willing to bet that's because they want the attention and interest to be on the fantasy world rather than becoming invested in 'our' world.\\n\\n\r\nSound has been slightly disappointing to me at times.  It's not that they get the wrong sounds or ignore important sounds.  They just seem to like to tone the volume down on many sounds and events that would bring some extra excitement to me.  Maybe it's because I'm a big movie theater guy and love nothing more than having the sound of a tank firing or a helicopter AT missile explode that can not only be heard but also felt.  The music on the other hand is excellent nothing short in helping define the nature of the plot along with the op and ed videos.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters in this story is rather mixed for me.  I'm loving the HUGE variety of characters in both design and personality.  There is no shortage of characters, you will find a character type you love, or would love to strangle with a corded phone, whether it's a strong minded female who seems to enjoy nothing more than close range combat, a military nurse with a heart of gold, a princess who loves her country but isn't above making tough decisions for her country's benefit and using others to do so, or a Prince who's arrogance, and abuses of slaves/prisoners (both physically and sexually) need to have him learn humility in the most painful way possible.  GATE doesn't disappoint with character variety.\\n\\n\r\nHowever character development is somewhat lacking, while some characters do develop with their struggles and learning how to operate in this new and alien world, the struggles they have to endure or overcome haven't yet proven to be detrimental to the plot or create events that would put the main character or the JSDF's mission in peril.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I'm enjoying this series and hope that it continues into a long running series which includes other countries becoming involved in this \"Special Region\" but hopefully not in conflict with each other, nothing ruins a story for me than pointless conflict between nations.",

            "content": "this review will have two different sides, which are my first attempt when it first aired and due to my inability to finish it (i started focusing on light novels and sort of dropped anime) i never got round to finishing it, so few weeks ago i started watching anime again and it has been in my watch list for ages and i thought why not. (there will be short summary in the last paragraph)\r\nfirst impression: when it first started out, it appealed to me a lot, i mean military and isekai genre combined with an mc that isnt a 16 year old moron, soyou could say that during my first attempt i loved it and would have likely given it an overall 7 or 8 out of 10 just because it seemed different and intriguing including the other world harem members (including the war god priestess with the scythe (if you know what i mean, lol jokes) but over all the characters at the time seemed really interesting to me that recently i decided why resume where i left of, since i enjoyed it back than let me rewatch it so i did... so for my initial impression of the 9 episodes i watched it would have been 7 or 8 out of 10. \\n\\n\r\n2nd attempt (may seem like a rant): over nationalistic and retardation on behalf of the author that seemed to forget the crimes that japan has committed in WW2 or perhaps he has been proud to of those events or perhaps ignored them and thought that the Japanese miltary was the most righteous existence in the world. \\n\\n\r\nLets get this straight japan was attacked so on their territory it was their right to defend themselves, i dont have an issue with that and the fact that when they went to the other world they built the defenses around the gate from further attacks by the primitive humans of that world along with monsters that isekai genre usually have. However the fact that instead of trying to negotiate with the humans that tried attacking them they just went and exterminated them with their fancy weapons? why those armies never posed a threat to them sending a military unit to negotiate with the army and the nations of this world would have been more beneficial and prevented useless slaughter in the overall picture but no. \\n\\n\r\nokay further down the line a civil war like event happens so the military once again shows of their power by exterminating the insurgents why? they could have just evacuated the civilians or negotiated an end to the battle and pointless slaughter but what they did is bring few dozen helicopters and start murdering more humans that never ever posed a threat to them just for what to show off that they could deal huge number of damage?? they could have done that during the military assault in the second episode.\\n\\n\r\nthan it turns that the japanese army that should only exist for national protection is more skillful than black ops from the strongest millitary nations of the world... see the picture Japan is the best the japanese military is in the right even if they pointlessly slaughter humans from a very ancient like civilisation.   \\n\\n\r\nEnd of Rant! (story 2/10)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: at first they seemed interesting but after their initial introduction they grew stale and cliche to the point that probably only Rory could interest most watcher (wink wink) but that would be only because she would only serve for fan service and distraction of the stupidity of the author. \\n\r\nscore: 3.5 but i will be lenient and give it a 4 just because they seemed interesting as they got introduced and some of their impression did seem okay...\\n\\n\r\nArt: brilliant so 8/10 along with good animation. \\n\r\nSound: was there any sound? i will just give it a 5/10\\n\r\nenjoyment: first time around around 7.7 (8) out of ten, second time 3.4/10 (3)\\n\r\noverall for the first impression it would have been (8) second (4/10) \\n\\n\r\nif you dont think much when watching anime than you will enjoy it likely otherwise it will be dreadful to you. \\n\\n\r\n(summary: over nationalistic bullcrap and a moronic author that likely was proud of the crimes committed by japanese military or never even knew of them and it probably seemed cool to him to mindlessly slaughter people that never posed a threat to jsdf in the isekai world.)",

            "content": "This anime is amazing. I've always wanted to see what it would be like if a modern military force went back in time against medieval forces. This anime satisfies something that I've wanted for a very long time.\r\nGate has a very interesting premise, and its also one of the only anime based off a modern military I've seen around, most military themed anime are all about mechas or medieval warfare. Gate brings something fresh to the table, something that hasn't been seen before, and it satisfy a certain niche when it comes to anime for me. Combines my two favorite things: all things modern military,and cute anime girls. Hell, it even gives a homage to Apocalypse Now with a scene where a whole squadron of helicopters arrive while blasting The Ride of The Valkyries. At this point, after watching a fair share of anime, I can definitely say that this has now become my number one favorite anime of all time, and I really hope more anime comes out with a focus around a modern military.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, watch this anime if you like cute girls, watch this if you like fantasy, watch this if you like an interesting new story, watch this if you like anime with main characters that are not oblivious and dense as a brick, or watch this for the same reason I watched it: the military porn. Oh yes, this anime packs a decent amount of military porn.\\n\\n\r\nI can't say enough praise for GATE, I think it just happens to satisfy the perfect niche for me. Hell it's the first anime thus far that I've written a review for, but that's only because I love it so much.\\n\\n\r\nSorry if the review is a bit terrible, it's my first written review of a anime.",

[please be nice this is my second review] I'll be sure to make it spoiler free!!\r\nI saw this anime in facebook and it looked interesting now I searched for it and watched the first episode with high hopes that this would be a good marathon and the early episodes did not disappoint! It was awesome, it was astonishing! I just loved the concept of this anime but then again it is an anime, and with these comes fan service, some parts of the episode that aren't really useful and alot ofuncovered plot.....\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory - 8/10 - Its really great that they could think of a storyline like this its really one of a kind.\\n\r\nI didn't rate it higher because there are parts in the anime that aren't really needed they should have focused more on the Empire or exploring the \"GATE\". Oh well.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8/10 - Drawing gears of war are really hard and they really worked hard on it you can really see them put detail into the tanks, helicopters ect. Though there are alot of scenes that the background were inactive.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10/10 - Sounds Im gonna give it a 10 because of that one episode hahaha watch it you'll see/hear why! XD\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 7/10 - There weren't really telling us much backstory of the characters guess due to the lack of episodes. But the characters are really cool, and other you'll hate so much that you'll laugh when... ops sorry watch it for yourself you'll know why.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10 - YOU'LL ENJOY IT I promise you!!\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8/10",

            "content": "The first season of Gate is interesing.\r\nThe story is quite original mixing nowadays military forces facing mediaval armies. As a passionate of militar armament, I mut say that this show is really accurate in terms of modern strategies. Every vehicle you see here is real and it is used by the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF). BUT, you will not see action in every chapter. There is a lot of politics, negotiations and humor in the story (just like in Star Wars: The Phantom Menace). And I feel that a bit of nationalism is not bad... But here you can see the JSDF beating the American,Chinsese and Russian special operations, which is quite ridiculous. It is not a flawless story but definitely enjoyable if you are patient and/or if you are into modern warfare and fantasy.\\n\r\n8.\\n\\n\r\nIn the other hand, the show gives us an spectacular animation. Two dimensional characters in sketchy background and three dimensional animated vehicles may sound awful... But it makes the show even more interesting to watch. For me, this aspect is just perfect.\\n\r\n10.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound aspect is important when you are trying to make a modern day armament related show, and this show doesn't fail. Realistic sound effects mixed with the typical sounds you can hear in every anime (and we all love), BUT unfortunately in seems that they had no resources to work in sound quality. Old fashion stereo is not good when the rest of the series is in a HQ level of sound. The opening song is average, nothing you will remember when you finish the season; the real magic comes when the orchestral music starts to sound in the background while the JSDF is kicking asses in another dimension. From the Kanochi Nite theme, to a mix between opera and Richard Wagner's \"The Ride of the Walkyries\"... The music makes everything in this show epic and... Mhm... Badass.\\n\r\n9.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the funniest element of Gate. The simple interaction between someone like you from this moder world and someone from a medieval famtastic world. The development is not much for the main protagonist, Itama, but it is very notorious in the rest of the cast. Every character suffers from the colateral effects of the war, so you will see them get over most of the bad situations in the series.\\n\r\n9.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said before, Gate has many kinds of interactions... But they get boring sometimes and makes you cringe sometimes with the typical \"let's go shopping and make publicity for Japan\" scenes. Even so, the action is just a demostration of... Mhm... Badassery. The camera angles, the colors, the realism of how a medieval army would end in front of a contemporary army (spoiler alert: the get destroyed). The action scenes here are something you will watch more than just once.\\n\r\n8.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is interesting and a bit of an experiment that I really enjoyed. The last episode leaves you wanting more (and that's what you actually get). So, if you are into extensive dialogue added between action scenes, then this anime is for you!",

            "content": "I started watching this because of how apparently \"popular\" it is, or rather how much it was talked about. I heard it was extreme with wish fulfillment and fanservice(not THAT fanservice, but it still did THAT at least at one point).\r\nStory 4/10: About as lackluster and wish fulfillment as it gets. A mysterious greek/roman architectural building just shows up out of nowhere perfectly placed in the middle of a Japanese street in the relative area of an anime/manga/doujin... Otaku event. No explanation whatsoever, and nobody even comments on how such a structure perfectly placed itself in the center of a Japanese road. It wasn't toobig or suspiciously small. It wasn't angled in any way. But exactly in the middle of the street between buildings perfectly aligned with the road, with enough space for Japanese to enclose it with their own building.\\n\\n\r\nEvery nation other than Japan is played to be thoroughly bad guys. It also frequently hops off topic to show how people love the JSDF/Japan for invading their world, killing hundreds of thousands, and literally causing civil wars and secessionist uprisings in nearby countries via their actions. These people are also the same refugees that fell victim to said events... But they ignore that and show that the JSDF and Japan always do the right thing.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10: The most redeeming factor of the show is in it's art, which in itself is a telltale problem since even bad and/or terrible animes can have great animation budgets and studios backing them. However most of the time you are simply looking at scenery or opinionated conversations between characters on dull backgrounds. The only action is when it is dramatically overdone to propaganda levels to stroke the JSDF's ego. Showing the \"Military Might\" of the JSDF by gunning/bombing/knife fighting iron-age soldiers using spears with no effort at all. In fact I don't think a single JSDF soldier was even injured in this first season.\\n\\n\r\nSound 6/10: It was good when it mattered, but seemed lackluster and overdone at times.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 5/10: Some characters were well made, mainly 2 of the 3 girls in the cast this season(not Rory) and another character that shows up at the end to get Itami's help. Of which Itami is a downright terrible character because of the sheer amount of wish fulfillment they forced into him.\\n\\n\r\nHis squad is full of completely hollow characters, and the only one to actually get any sort of depth to their character seemed to be the most reasonable choice for a love interest. But there was virtually no interaction between her and Itami outside of Comedy. And Itami himself is surrounded by underage fantasy girls while basically choosing to be forever alone for the sake of being an Otaku. Doin your parents proud, Itami.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 6/10: For the first season it's relatively enjoyable. At least until you read between the lines or notice the reoccurring themes. Of which is obviously using as much \"Fan Favourite\" things in the anime/source material as they can to try and appeal to as much audience as possible... and of course what seems to be Japanese Propaganda.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 5/10: Not awful by any means, but it isn't remotely the best thing I've ever seen. It lacks any real depth to virtually all characters outside of maybe 3 \"side\" characters, and focus's too much on showing how \"awesome\" Japan and the JSDF are... Constantly. All while avoiding any real sense or realistic reactions to such events occurring.",

            "content": "This Review Applies to Both Seasons\r\nAlthough this anime has an interesting concept, and a pretty well done realistic storyline, it does feel too much like propaganda. (The video review is up on my channel, here is the written)\r\nStory - 7/10\r\nThe premise of this anime, is that there is GATE which appeared out of nowhere and opened in Japan. Now invaders from the other side of the Gate started attacking Japan, little do they know, they have invaded a world that is far beyond them, and they get destroyed by the Japan Self-Defence Forces. Yes it is the modern technology of world vs. a fantasy medievalworld, so in short its Guns vs Swords, and that\u2019s not going to turn out well for one side, at least. And so follows the story of Itami Youji of the JSDF and Japan trying to form a peace treaty with the world beyond the Gate. \\n\\n\r\nThe pacing of this anime feels kind of weird. At times it will feel fast, on flowing fine, but there are also times when the pacing just feels slow and drags on. GATE feels likes a war drama, as even though we do follow one of the main characters, there are multiple stories within the anime that play different parts in the whole entire plot. And when there is too many stories, there is quite a few that few rush and incomplete, in fact that is what happened to some of the stories in GATE. Some of the side story is completely forgotten and left out leaving you wondering, what actually happened. And the problem comes in during the second half, when it was a really long drag to the finale and they didn\u2019t really completed it properly, there was so many things left undone, because they focused too much time on one thing, the other is swept to the side. The storyline in general, starts out as an adventure, but soon becomes a political story involving the government of both factions. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nItami Youji is the main character of the show, and he is the one we follow the most. On the surface he is just an otaku just trying to read doujinishi. But in actuality he is a First Lieutenant of the JSDF, and a really highly regarded one at that. However he does imply he is only in the military because it pays well, and he can use that pay check to fund his otaku life, which he would preferably prioritize. Over the course of the show, we get to know a little more about his character, but unfortunately we don\u2019t see a lot of development from him, for the reason being, he always seems to know what to do. There is a slight development around the middle, when he decides to do what\u2019s right than just follow orders, but even that was kind of really done very quickly. Itami pretty just follows orders half the time and is there to represent a soldier, who is caught in everything, including his own harem.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of his Harem, there are 3 main girls who are part of it; Lelei, Tuka and Rory. Rory who is best girl probably gets the least amount of attention during the show, but she makes up for it for her badassery. Lelei gets some subtle development, as she learns more about the human world she applies her knowledge to help Itami, and is sort of a translator for the JSDF. Tuka probably gets the most attention out of the main girls of the harem, being very fragile at first, not accepting her reality, comes around later to see reality. These characters are pretty much around to fill out Itami\u2019s fantasy harem, which he gains.\\n\\n\r\nAnother character that needs some mention is Pina co Lada, yes she sounds like a cocktail. She plays a major part of the peace treaty, as she saw the difference in strength between her army and Japan\u2019s and rather than having a pointless conflict, she is searching for peace between the two countries for the good of her own country. And she would probably get the most development in the show as she learns about Japan, but also learning about her own country and learning how to be a leader. \\n\r\nThere is a lot of characters in GATE, because there is a lot of stories. There are few characters that get quite a bit of attention and some that don\u2019t as much. Which really bugs me because some characters\u2019 stories get forgotten, when they felt like they were going somewhere. Especially at the end when some stories just concluded very abruptly and conveniently. What I do like about the characters are their interactions with each other. Seeing the two worlds connect can lead to entertaining and interesting conversations. And I like how all the characters are rather likeable, and the ones you hate, you really hate. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Sound - 7/10, 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI expected decent standard A-1 animation for this show, and it delivers in that aspect. The art style is rather standard, most the animation is smooth, and they look fine. If you look closely, it does look like the art style was pencil drawn and coloured, because you see slight pencil line marks in the backgrounds and characters. What did bother me were the dragon scenes in the show, when a far the dragon would not look right, it doesn\u2019t look part of that world. The shooting effects is fine, it can be really flashy of course. What impressed me the most was some the magic used in the world, and when a spell or a field starting lightning up, it would like amazing. \\n\\n\r\nThe OST is fine for what it is. It is a nice mixture of fantasy and military music. You get quite a few strings here and there. The OP has a nice rock vibe track to, which gives you a conflict and adventure vibe. However the ED is completely different, it\u2019s a more pop track featuring the main 3 girls singing the tracks. It\u2019s a nice catchy dance track and I love it, but there are times during the anime when it would end of a gritty or tense cliff-hanger, and suddenly some happy pop music starts playing, which completely kills the vibe. The sound effects in the show is quite good, the sounds of bullets vs swords really shows us that these are two different worlds conflicting with each other. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI much rather enjoyed the concept of GATE. It was an interesting idea, mixing the two worlds together and putting it in a realistic setting, by getting the politics and military involved. However I wish the story was a bit faster, because at times it will drag and you just want to see how the 2 worlds interact with each other more, which was the most thing I enjoyed about the show. Seeing the 2 worlds react to each other\u2019s culture. But there is one major problem I find with this anime, and that is, it\u2019s TOO one sided. Everything is completely in favour of the JSDF. They can literally do no wrong, in the show, they never feel like they are in trouble at any given time in the show. Except when they were facing a dragon, but that was short lived. And it kind of annoys me because its propaganda, they want to show how great the military is, but it doesn\u2019t lead to great story telling, because there is false suspense. Like I said the most enjoyment of this show is seeing the 2 worlds interact with each other.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict - 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nAs we draw closer to the end of the review, I give the story a 7. It has an really interesting concept and executes in main plot rather well with its realistic story. But the pacing can be off at times and there were a lot of different stories, which feel forgotten. \\n\\n\r\nFor the animation and sound, I give it a 7 and 8. The animation and art style is standard for A-1, and the pencil style sort of works, but I was never really wowed by many things except the magic. The dragon looked like it didn\u2019t belong in the world. The soundtrack is fine and does a good job of mixing the 2 genres together. The OP is pretty good and the ED is really nice catchy, but it can kill the vibe sometimes at the end of a tense episode.\\n\\n\r\nFor the characters I give it a 7. There is a lot of likeable characters in the show, with slight development for every character. And that is still impressive, for such a huge cast. But some of them are left forgotten, unfinished and rushed. I do like the character interactions, but I felt like there could\u2019ve been more.\\n\\n\r\nFor my own personal enjoyment, I give it a 8. I was really interested in the concept and hooked into the world. I enjoyed watching the two worlds interact and learn about one another. However, it felt too one sided for me to really be suspense of anything during the time this anime was aired, it\u2019s kind of predictable.\\n\\n\r\nSo for the overall score of GATE, I give it a 7.5.10 after round it all up. I recommend this show to people who love military genre or those who love fantasy, or people who like watching alternative dimensions, because this is probably for you.\\n",

            "content": "Okay, so from what I've seen I believe this was supposed to be 25 episodes, and the ending of the last episode seems to support this. It's a hook for a second season that I hope happens, because this is a very interesting concept that I want to see explored further.\r\nSo, basic premise of the story (that you can find above mostly) is that the Japanese military is sent through a Gate to a fantasy world after the fantasy world attacks ours. From here the military save a few people, and our otaku protagonist i sent through. This anime doesn't try to hid the factthat it's partly a harem between three fantasy girls, but it does not focus on that like Monster Musume (not bagging it, just don't compare them).\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the story goes a lot deeper. It goes into the politics and some interesting ideas like how Japan deals with other countries who are greedy and want their share of the other world. Sounds boring, but anyone who has watched either Spice and Wolf or Maoyuu Maou Yuusha would know that it's not. \\n\\n\r\nAnyway, art. It's not anything groundbreaking but there is something about it that feels more mature, other than the fact that the MC isn't a teenager in high-school like most anime of this kind. I don't know, but they got a lot right in the visuals that I don't know how to describe, it's not awkwardly bright like some anime, and it's nothing unique like Zankyou no Terror, but there is the polish that just works.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, so the sound is something that I've began to take notice of recently a lot more since the aforementioned Zankyou no Terror, as well as Code Geass and (don't shoot me for saying this) Fairy Tail. I used to only pay attention to the OP and ED for this section, but there wasn't anything that stood out for me during the show. The music was great at setting the mood, but there was nothing like Is or Von from ZnT or The Dark Guild Theme from FT. (Andi realised after this that I didn't mention Cowboy Bebop or Baccano, but I haven't actually watched them even if I love the soundtracks, plus they are on a different planet entirely).\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are what really make this anime shine. Sure, you have your standard fantasy staples like magicians, elves, humans and various human animal cross-breeds, but they are unique characters in their own right. And god help me if I don't praise this anime for having MCs that AREN'T TEENAGERS!!! Sure the guy is still an otaku, as are some of his friends (and this one old guy) and the audience can relate to him when he talks about waifus and memorizing OPs, but he ISN'T a dumb teenager. And stemming off this not all the characters in the faux-harem are generic. The mage is interested in our society (and she becomes freaking awesome because of chemistry), the elf has some interesting PTSD, and Rory... well... Rory is...\\n\r\nSo, the other side characters all have their own unique charm. Princess Pina Co Lada (I legit replayed that scene to check I didn't hear that wrong) isn't your standard princess, especially when she discovers... well...\\n\r\nAnd then you have the other military characters, specifically Takeo and Shino. Takeo is a fellow otaku to Itami who provides some much needed otaku banter  between the characters. Meanwhile Shino is the strong headed one who provides some really great banter as well as well as ideas. There is one more character (who I won't spoil) who is adorable and awesome.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, how i enjoyed it. It was bloody great, but I was lead to believe there would be 25 eps, not twelve. And the final episode shows that. the last lines are legitimately (spoilers I think, but not really) \"It's only been half a year...\" Yea... even the show acknowledges that... I wish there was more because there were some plotlines developing in the last episode that I'm just praying for a season 2.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, I think this show is a great show in the Fantasy genre, and instead of going in pretending it's not a harem (*cough* SAO *cough), it makes you think it's a harem when it's not really. I give it an almost killing a dragon with a rocket launcher but not quite/10 because of that ending that just feels unsatisfying.",

            "content": "This one is clearly among the best anime of the Summer 2015 season. The story is fairly original, involving a gate opening up between Tokyo and a fantastical world where dragons, monsters, elves, and others exist. It all starts with an invasion by the army from this parallel world, and soon we get an army of Japanese soldiers going over to the special region in an effort of recognizance. \r\nThe clash of word generates plenty of interesting and funny situations. There are a myriad of awesome characters to appreciate and learn to understand. Among these, we have one of my favorite characters in an animeever, Rory Mercury.\\n\\n\r\nThe series does a very good job in blending in some political situations that engage our attention, and of course there is a little fan service here and there too (like the vast majority of series today), but this is kept in check and does not take away anything from the enjoyment of the series.\\n\\n\r\nI found the animation to be very good and there is a lot of creativity displayed in some of the characters creation. Overall, a very nice, well-rounded series. There is a little bit of an issue with the fact that it feels like we only got half a season, with another 12 episodes coming in January 2016, but it is understandable.",

            "content": "GATE is an anime with a premise that far exceeds the actual execution. \r\n    While the show is not brimming with originality, the foundation is solid.  Like many contemporary shows, the protagonist is thrown into a fantasy world, but it is not virtual and the stakes are much higher because of it.  This is not an RPG.  There are thousands of lives at stake on both ends of the spectrum.  \r\n    Unfortunately, the show tends to gloss over its more serious issues.  Violence is portrayed in a way that lacks emotional impact.  Theshow glorifies the JSDF mowing down the soldiers and bandits of the other world, which can admittedly be fun to watch.  However, not one JSDF soldier is painted in a negative light.  There is no sexism among the JSDF\u2019s ranks.  They do not leave behind any villagers to save themselves.  None of their killings are unjustified.  There is practically nothing wrong with the JSDF while the other world\u2019s inhabitants are often dehumanized because of their technological and governmental inferiority.\\n\\n\r\n    The other world\u2019s \u201cbad guys\u201d tend to act so stereotypically that they are often scheming, have an evil sneer on their face, or both at some point.  The worst of the modern world tends to be anyone not Japanese.  In a sense, the world building is not the strongpoint of this show.  That leads to the viewer feeling almost no sympathy or connection to the other world\u2019s population, aside from the few characters that follow around the protagonist.\\n\\n\r\n    As for that aspect, the main cast of characters are why anybody should be watching.  Of course, the ones following the protagonist are female.  The youngest is the most soft spoken, while the oldest tends to be the most bold.  That is commonplace.  Fortunately all of them are interesting characters with unique attributes that make them fun to watch.  One of them is an apostle with superhuman abilities, another is a mage, while the other is a high elf.  And yes, they are all \u201ccute.\u201d  If any of these characters were to disappear, the show would not work as well as it does.  That includes the protagonist, Itami, who tends to keep everyone together.  \\n\\n\r\n    The art is fine if a bit bland at times.  Nothing really stands out except for the terrible CGI dragon that rears its head every so often.  This is a show that someone should watch for its cast of characters and not its story.  It is a fun break in between something else far more serious, and it does a damn good job at that.\\n",

            "content": "My honest thoughts. I came into this thinking it would be super lame and an immense invasion by modern tech. But this was surprisingly awesome and full of heart The characters are well developed and I love the way they speak Japanese slow when trying to speak the other language. It almost feels like a cool anime to prop up the real JSDF and how they act in real life. As ex-military who lived in Japan for 10 years, this is honestly how they actually are. Really good people who uphold human rights. As for the rest of the anime, I really like the artstyle and the concept of the story. If you like military and/or fantasy, this is the perfect mash-up. It even has some romance intertwined. Looking forward to watching season 2!",

It's just not strong enough to support side plots or in depth backstories. \r\nGate has a pretty vivid color scheme that is quite nice to look at. Nothing really stands out as far as characters or animation is concerned.\r\nOpening sounds good enough. No problems with voice lines or sound effects.\r\nThere's a lot of characters. The problem with having lots of characters is that they need a lot of time to flesh out each one. This just isn't possible in 12 episodes. I found myself liking the characters, butwanting more development and depth. \\n\\n\r\nGate performed equally well in all categories, but excelled in none. Humor and action are present but not in enough quantity to carry the show. It takes equal parts of each area to prop the show up. A conglomeration of genres and themes rather than a singular aspect to watch.\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr average",

            "content": "GATE: JIEITAI KANO CHI NITE KAKU TATAKAERI SEASON 1 ANIME REVIEW\r\nOVERALL: 9\r\nPLOT: 9/10\r\nWhat if there is a world other than our world? What if there are living beings we don't know of? What if a portal from another world will pop out of nowhere and an unknown kind of which we hardly imagine starts to flash in our eyes? That is what this series show us. It is not your typical protagonist who's been teleported in another world. It is not also something like being stuck in a game where there are no means to escape. Not also the type of protagonist who's born withsuperior talents or been given a power to outdo the rest. It also tackles the economic decisions a society will make when a new people adds up, a new location or continent or a world has been identified. How they start anew. How other country thinks of a way to get the better ones. How the greed of peope will possibly destroy a good opportunity of humankind.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe main character of this story is somewhat normal. Normal in a way that he has his hobbies, his love for his priorities. His craving for things he decided is important in his life. He is not the common prince charming like face nor the charismatic one. He is also not the kind of super intelligent, cool kind of guy who dismissed any conversation he don't find useful. He's a kind hearted guy, using his mind to think rationally. He's lazy most of the time, but one of his priority is to help mankind. He has skills that he manage to get through hardship. He is humble and humane. In line with the other characters, well yeah, most of the anime now always have a loli character. I guess that is also a norm.\\n\\n\r\nVOICE AND ANIMATION: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is great and I think that is normal. What I mean normal is the common animation these days. The emotions was well written in the face of the characters, as well as the things around them. The actions taken place is also expressed successfully. And I don't have any comment with the sounds since it is also fine. I'm really thinking about Itami. I know there is another anime character who looks like him. I just can't remember who it is.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed it, yes. The concept of the series is unique for me. It is literally reverse than other stories. The actions and thinking of the characters are shocking and also comes from a different view. It is fun to watch since the protagonist is an otaku, you can quite relate to the feelings he show along the series.\\n\\n\r\nENDING: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe ending is, of course, a cliffhanger. There is a season 2of it which I haven't watch it yet. There is more to come and the story is just getting started. The only thing I'm kinda disappointed or must we say kinda expected is for the protagonist to show his other skills. Something like combat skills. I want him to show off more, to show us another expression of his own, to help us know him more. Well, maybe in the next season. But overall, yeah. This anime is worth watching.",

And then it quickly devolves into a showcase of the two worst anime tropes: Japanese hyper-nationalist jingoism, and loli-girl harem.\r\nHad these show handled its invaders from another world theme more seriously, it would have been a damn fine show. Instead, no one in this universe behaves like a real person, or is realistic in any sense of the word. The entire purpose of theseries is to show off how great Japan is and how idiotic the rest of the world is.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and it lets young dudes watching it imagine that they are the main character, surrounded by cute underage-looking girls that fawn over him constantly.\\n\\n\r\nIt's just sick, and very emblematic of where anime is right now, which is a bad place.",

Action, emotion, comedy, suspense, intrigue, sexiness, science, etc. All the characters are solid and fill their roles well. So stop reading this review and watch it. Seriously, anime like this doen't come along every day so go check it out. Okay, I should point out that this series is not for every one. It's portrayal of women leaves something to be desired. They're all painted as victim at one point or another. Except Shino Kuribayashi & Rory Mercury. Twowomen who easily hold their own on a battlefield. This series is also about the horror of war, so it's violent and depicts it. As it should it is a war story after all. People die in war, it's a simple fact. So I tend to loathe series featuring war where the human toll isn't made clear to both us and the characters. Other than that it's an anime for everyone (well if the SOLE reason you watch anime is moe girls or supernatural bishonen then mebe not everyone). I'd even suggest a few of my non anime friends watch it, but not with their kids though. Yeah this ones not for the kids.",

            "content": "Well, this is one of those unusual productions that actually kicks off a whole lot of UNUSUAL things in the MOST UNUSUAL ways, and it works fine for me.\r\nThis is not your usual yet still VERY familiar plot-lined anime. Never mind the propaganda and whatnot, it's all about how different we all have different ways to interpret things. Most people say it's the typical OLD VS NEW route, well, all I see is Science vs Fantasy [I mean, dragons exist in medieval times (lol)? That's news to me.]. It's like watching 2 genres fighting each other yet both want to make peace (Hate-Love.... Oh wait,Tsundere is way better to describe it AND I DEFINITELY LOVE EM.). Eherm.... M'kay, here's is what I can say about this series.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 9: Given that this is an almost untouched plot route (Kinda, since Outbreak Company also uses the same Initial plot LITERALLY), I can't judge much without proper reference, BUT!!!, even if it's unknown to me, the tension and full-blown one-sided power balance left an undeniably UNBIASED point of view on the story's situation. Ignoring the propaganda-like feeling (Well, the JSDF IS the Protagonist force in the story, it's obvious it would feel like one), Guns beat Swords and Rockets beat Dragons combination is the MOST STRAIGHTFORWARD slap in the face for those who love fantasy, and I bet it felt good.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8: Not much to say. I did like the |C/Slide in| kind of display where different angles of characters can be seen without much of a change in the frames itself, but it did leave a lacking feeling when it comes to group to 1 character conversations. Aside from that and repeated parts, it's good. Oh, and I gave points to the Opening's art design (Personal points). I actually liked it (Personally).\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8: Aside from gun shots and bone crackles (Which I like), everything was ok. The Opening song fits the art design. If anything, I wanted to hear more bones breaking (But I guess that's almost impossible since they die before they can even move a meter closer to the Jieitai).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8: The MOST mysterious character in this anime is the MC itself. I won't spoil so all I can say is that him, even though an otaku, being a \"Unique\"-type of soldier was unexpected and quite a laughable surprise. It didn't add to anything but it still made him kinda special in ways a normal MC, with above-average intelligence or fast reflexes, will look like crap. Aside from the elf being useless, the other characters, including the squad members of the MC, where all good tier.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10: Having a pretty unbalanced war playing out, the one sided massacre was, in a sense, quite an amusing idea (*Cringe* I feel like I'm turning into a Psycho). Just kidding. It was that reality-like balance that gave the anime a bit of excitement. 'Fantasy never stood a chance to Science' -like theme gave birth to the idea of what was right. 'If the science side wanted to wipe out or forcefully conquer the fantasy side, they could in mere minutes, so why not?', this question is the real point I wanted to watch in the whole series to the very end, and I personally enjoyed it much.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9: I'd say this is one I might never forget (I wish I could so I would re-watch it). It's not the best for all since there are people who see this as propaganda or people who hate the one-sided war, but it still gives an idea of why absolute power isn't the best solution to solving conflicts.",

If you just want to sit back and watch a really fun and interesting show, you're looking in the right place.\r\nStory:\r\nMost of the story is seeing how a fantasy civilization is exposed to the today's advanced military technology.  It's a pleasure seeing how they interact.  (i.e. the funny moments where people call war vehicles \"iron elephants or iron Pegasuses\").  It's pretty rare for anything to really embrace both fantasy and modern themes because most shows are either fantasy, modern, or modern with a little fantasy.\r\nArt:\r\nArt is pretty detailed.  It doesn'tlook low budget at all. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI really like the opening.  It's not something that will stick in your head, but you may think twice before skipping over it each time it plays.  The rest of the show's OST's is just alright.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThis is probably a weak point in the show. I didn't really find anyone too interesting.  Almost everyone fits some kind of archetype and doesn't really change at all.  Although they're somewhat boring, I found everyone to be likable, including the protagonist.  He's not some whiny kid or a complete loser.  He's actually pretty mature compared to many other anime protagonists. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: \\n\r\nI'd say this is one of my favorite shows of the season.  I found that the setting made this show really fun to watch.  That being said, it's no masterpiece, but that's ok.  This show is an example of a show that's just \"fun\", so I would recommend this to everyone.  \\n\\n\\n\\n",

Several minor plot points were started but not resolved, left me unsatisfied with most character specific stories.\r\nArt 5 - Very inconsistent quality, falls between an 8 and a 4. Serviceable, but I was hoping for better consistency for an anime in 2015. Ughhhh the CG was terrible. I cringed every time.\r\nSound 5 - No memorable OST whatsoever, lack of catchy OPs or EDs. Generic and totally average.\r\nCharacters 6 - Bare bones personality, really there to fill fetishes and requiredstory roles. Nobody memorable outside of Rory. It makes due, just not up to par.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7 - Overall an enjoyable anime. Would like to see it expanded on, and will probably watch season 2 to see if Itami and Rory bang.\\n\\n\r\nFinal score 6 -  As a product by its own merits, it falls short of being called good, but my hope is that the franchise will see to some of my gripes in the near future. It's worth the watch if you enjoy military and fantasy as this anime caters to both. If you don't particularly care for either, than I would avoid it. Your time is better spent elsewhere.

The typical NEET/otaku about to go into a fantasy world... only our typical NEET otaku also happens to be an exemplary member of Japanese SDF (military). This has the same flaw as \"Irregulars\" anime where the main good guy is just too strong or too good at what he does. And we're given lame excuses to how they become like that... but rather than spiting the animefor these flaws, I found myself charmed by them.\\n\\n\r\nI also specifically REALLY hated the blonde elf girl. Not only was she both boring and predictable, she got incredibly annoying in the next season at least for me. She's literally there to be a simple eye candy for the elf fanboys.\\n\\n\r\nThing is I believe this anime is literally propaganda to try to get the male youth wasting away their lives as otakus to join the SDF. This is definitely a shounen but it doesn't play like one; shounen generally have their characters constantly one up a stronger villain every arc without much substance. This however is different. The \"protagonist\" side is the one with modern military. They can literally take over and wipe out this fantasy world in 1 day if they wanted to. Diplomacy, approaches to unknown culture, and interactions? These are all realistic. Sure it's fantasy world with fantasy characters... but the first few episodes are so identical to Generation Kill and their journey of sitting in humvees through Iraq invasion.",

            "content": "Generally speaking GATE is not something I could recommend (unless you are really into guns/military). The plot is utter bullshit and the characters have no personality whatsoever (except the JSDF guys, those are ALL psychopaths and/or bipolar).\r\nThis show turns what was a good premise into a generic harem. Why you ask? Because apparently you give most otakus a bunch of generic girls and some big ass guns and the plot's covered for the most (even if it's blatant propaganda).\r\nOk, so let's start with what did good:\r\nArt - 8.5:\r\nLet's face it, the animation quality is good, particularly the military equipment. The characters designs are also welldone albeit too generic, you really feel the A-1 look (SAO, A/Z, etc.). The things I found halfheartedly done were the backgrounds that were at times too plain and the color palette used for the characters from the other world as It is one quite overused one.\\n\\n\r\nFrom here on it goes downhill, REALLY fast\\n\\n\r\n//SPOILERS AHEAD!\\n\\n\r\nStory - 3:\\n\r\nAn unknown gate to other world appears in Japan, more precisely the middle of Ginza, Tokyo. From this gate a hellish army comes out, equipped with bronze/iron age weapons and charges in a sudden invasion to Japan. Our MC who was passing nearby going to buy some doujins, gets dragged into the fight of the JSDF and the invaders (cause yeah, we can mobilize an army in nanoseconds). Here we learn he is from the JSDF and we watch him help the useless policemen evacuate people (as a side note, despite the blood-fest surrounding all he can think is lit. \"shit, I won't be able to buy my doujins\").\\n\r\nThen, after fending off the invasion with surprising ease Japan has to send an Army there but the JSDF can't operate outside Japan, what do we do? We declare the other world part of Japan (cause we can). What do we do there? Massacre 'em all, we have to slaughter at least 100k or they won't take us seriously.\\n\r\nOk so far it's not so bad right, It may have a couple of issues but It's still decent. Except it's not cause apparently everyone belonging to the JSDF (which by the way aren't real soldiers, when they are off work they are not considered military, plus they have pretty much never taken part in real combat) are first rate soldiers. They are more skilled than any operatives from all countries with an active army (US, Russia, China) and have the \"right\" set of morals and therefore are the \"good guys\".\\n\r\nI mean yeah, they couldn't say \"As a response from hogging the gate the Americans cut out all the weapon sales to Japan\" or \"by agreement of the 3 superpowers they decide to: \\n\r\ninvade Japan and secure the gate\".\\n\r\nor\\n\r\nblast the gate with a Nuke\".\\n\r\nor\\n\r\nkill the people with a Neutron Bomb and leave the gate intact.\"\\n\r\nbut still the OPness of the JSDF is...\\n\\n\r\nIn short: Japan vs The World (Japan is the good guy) = Japan Wins\\n\\n\r\nPS: The EU doesn't exist apparently in this setting.\\n\\n\r\nPS2: Global peaceful negotiations don't exist either.\\n\\n\r\nPS3: There's a complete reenacting of Apocalypse Now (They even play Ride of The Valkyries).\\n\\n\r\nCharcters - 3:\\n\r\nThe characters are pretty basic, an otaku deadbeat who's a 1st Lieutenant in the JSDF who puts a front of being a laze ass and is in fact quite skilled. This guy who gets his dream come true of having his own harem is in fact a psychopath as every \\n\r\n other operative of the JSDF. This guys despite having close to null combat experience start massacring tons of people to then go to eat happily together with the non hostile locals. \\n\r\nIt's really crazy, the horrors of war are very well depicted, but our characters seem immune to the effects of it (piles of ravaged corpses, civilian deaths by the thousands, etc). It ends up being a one-sided war/massacre, all the while we are reminded that the JSDF are the \"good guys\". Even the MCs main ex-wife shows lit. no expression after witnessing the (just killed) dead bodies of 10+ special ops operatives in front of them in her house.\\n\r\nThere hasn't been any mention to the girls and well that's because there's not much to talk, It's your usual generic harem cast, the big boobed blonde (elf) who's an airhead, the sadistic and lustful loli and the \"I have no personality\" magician girl plus an empire's sheltered princess (with knight complex) that after brief contact suddenly develops an extreme liking to Yaoi (cause yeah Yaoi manga is that good apparently, I should read some). Hell, if the people from this world understood/liked Japanese culture like the other world characters, otakus wouldn't be considered that strange of a thing.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 6:\\n\r\nNo special songs nor I like the OP/ED, It's rated this high solely because the seiyuus aren't half bad.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 5:\\n\r\nAs much as It pains me to admit I like guns (not enough to be a gun maniac\\n\r\nbut enough to enjoy the battle scenes even if they are ridiculous). What I regret is the lack of newer airplanes (i.e F-15J, F2, etc) but well whatever.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 5:\\n\r\nIn a way I think maybe I'm being to harsh but at the same time I think I'm being to lenient. It's impossible to overlook the propaganda, sure If you don't care or you are just a diehard japan supremacist this may hit in the right spot but It doesn't sit right with me. Disregarding this fact that the situation is so unrealistic that one starts thinking: why even try to put politics? hell, had they done what most anime do (First try a peaceful approach, to at least make them look like the \"good guys\" and pretend the world is comprised of Japan and a great... sea?) It could've been better.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: Watch this if you are a diehard war/weapons fan and don't care about plot but don't expect tactics or strategy, we are talking about brute force only here\\n\r\n(Or if you are one of those people that can enjoy anything as long as it has boobs, an elf or a loli on it).",

            "content": "Gate: Jieitai Kanochi nite, Kaku Tatakaeri is where the present day and the fantasy world collides. Literally.\r\nHaving a gate that provides entry to both sides was an interesting watch. With all the stories about how this was supposed to be propaganda for the SDF and all that, it doesn't matter. Purely as an anime point of view, every episode went by as a flash and left me wanting more.\r\nGiven that I'm only a starter anime fan, I was happy I picked this title to complete. Obviously the real world's firepower and might would overwhelm the fantasy world, but I saw how much potential the animecan have (although it won't be too late for the production company to follow through with more seasons). With the premise of how differently life is with the advance of technology in the present day, we could have seen more of the understanding between the fantasy world and the SDF and society in present day Japan as a whole: differences, similarities and all the fundamentals of life.\\n\\n\r\nThe writers can also pursue more towards the politics of Japan and the other countries towards the importance of the new land and the potential of newer resources and raw materials they could find in the other world (there's a town full of magicians and a big-ass red fire dragon around, we can assume that the raw materials can be used in the development of nuclear power, etc).\\n\\n\r\nWhich leads to the next agenda: Magic. Loads of magicians, deities and demigods, etc? There were people complaining that the SDF were OP towards the Imperial army - there's so much potential to getting the battles in a bigger scale - imagine sorcerers and a demigod against riflemen (seriously, I'm pretty sure I can count the small number of casualties in the SDF's side, could've added more depth with a higher amount of wounded or even deaths in the soldiers' ranks.\\n\\n\r\nBut all in all, I had fun. This was the whole purpose of catching this anime. So many holes can be filled, and yes since it was a harem, we still needed to see the interactions between the MC and the girls right? I mean, if there wasn't the whole dynamic of the anime would've been different. And I probably wouldn't be this much of a fan. Enjoy, everyone.",

            "content": "A mystical gate to another world opens up, and out pours an army of tedious genre bullshit.\r\nGATE's choice to make the Earthlings far more powerful than the fantasy nations should, in principle, have been an interesting one. Combat is consistently one of the most boring and decadently overstylized elements of anime. Instead of a digestible through-line \u2013 the reckless charge gradually disintegrates under unanswerable fire, the duelist affects a false opening to bait a real one from his opponent \u2013 anime usually gives us visual noise, \"badass\" dialogue, and arbitrary \"dramatic\" violation of the author's own, self-devised rules. Taking any of prospect military defeat offthe table at the outset could have created an opening for more absorbing sources of tension. It's a culturally and diplomatically fraught situation, a kind of super-Colombian Exchange in a present-day context complete with modern communications, mass media, democratic politics and great-power competition. Rich and rewarding stories might have been told.\\n\\n\r\nInstead we get a bunch of completely pointless \"battle\" scenes. Numerous one-sided massacres are depicted in loving detail; the protagonists make no attempt to deter battle or obtain the enemy's surrender, and the antagonists obligingly charge into meaningless death for no reason. After a while, the writers seem to become aware that this is a problem, and start reaching for ways to place the protagonists in genuine danger. Unfortunately they're absolutely terrible at it. Small, isolated patrols travel through hostile territory for no reason and run into completely predictable trouble. At one point the protagonist's motor convoy is held up, literally, by mounted knights pointing lances through the opened windows of their Toyotas; instead of flooring it and scattering the opponents, he gets out of the truck to \"negotiate\" and is promptly and predictably captured.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem with GATE is not that it's militant nationalist propaganda. Some of the unquestioned masterpieces of 20th century film are militant nationalist propaganda. The problem with GATE is that it's narratively incoherent. Events happen for no reason other than plot convenience and characters act with no motivation other than playing to type. Russia, China, and the United States (!) are depicted as jealous international rivals simply because the author doesn't like foreigners. Japan monopolizes access to the gate (isn't it more like an international strait?) and seemingly annexes the entire fantasy world as the \"Special Region,\" but the rival countries don't seem to object or apply any conventional form of pressure against Japan. Instead and for no clear reason they send terrorist hit squads into Japan to be promptly massacred while spouting dialogue along the lines of \"Argh! We mere Delta Force operatives are no match for the superior Japanese!\"\\n\\n\r\nWe're repeatedly assured in dialogue that this nonsensical international struggle revolves around the fantasy world's \"strategic resources.\" We're never shown these resources nor even told what they are until well into the second season; somehow the world knows these resources exist and are extremely important, but not where or what they are. We never meet or even hear about geologists or natural scientists of any kind, nor for that matter linguists, anthropologists, ethnobotanists, or anyone else with a relevant civilian occupation. A demigodess and a powerful mage hang out with the main character yet no-one seems especially interested in investigating the entirely unknown physical principles underlying their abilities, nor does anyone seem bothered by the implications for world religions of a woman claiming divinity and able to manifest miracles at will. One subplot hinges on the Japanese side's complete and explicit disinterest in a large number of dragon scales which we're later told are an organic material comparable to tungsten, one of the hardest and densest materials in existence. The supposedly strategic resources eventually turn out to be mundane cash cows like uranium and petroleum.\\n\\n\r\nMinor details and story beats are just as botched as the big picture. Armaments and military equipment are depicted in loving, autistic detail; meanwhile bare-headed soldiers salute civilians indoors, subordinates unashamedly deprecate superiors, and the commanding officer takes a spontaneous nap in a war zone without telling anyone. One of the soldiers \u2013 a 5' redhead with big tits, naturally \u2013 is assigned the role of beat-down artist and repeatedly wins unnecessary melee combats with multiple armored opponents twice her size bearing superior weapons. One-off characters are introduced by name in subtitles for no reason, including a stereotypically merchant-looking guy who's there solely to deal in merchandise. The subtitle identifies him as a merchant.\\n\\n\r\nThere's just no enjoyable viewing of GATE. As a drama it's one-dimensional, clich\u00e9-ridden, and unserious. As a harem comedy it's burdened with boring, tonally inappropriate scenes of massacre and high politics. The animation is mostly unobjectionable but done purely by-the-numbers. Even as right-wing nationalist propaganda, it will repel anyone with the slightest degree of sophistication whatever their politics. It's nothing but trash.",

            "content": "This anime at first glanced looked very appealing to the eye. Its about current military might clashing vs Mid evil times. It had a concept not done regularly and surely was warranted a watch. \r\nThis series at first started of strong but as the episodes went on I gradually got more and more turned off as I watched. This series suffers from wanting to be so much that it failed in mostly everything it set out to accomplish. But at least it succeeded in being good Japaneses propaganda.  \r\n--\r\nFirstly, I never liked one sided series. By that I mean one side is completely moredominant  than the other and its not fun seeing a series where one sided completely dominates the other in every aspect. I at least expected for the Mid-evil kingdoms to form some kind of advantage sometime. Nope! The JSDF(Japanese Self Defense Force) completely demolishes everything it comes against. It was even able to beat the red dragon(which is suppose to be the strongest creature in the other world) with only 3 jeeps and a pair of guns. The JSDF is portrayed as the ultimate fighting group that not even other countries could hope to beat, with scenes of american or Russian soldiers being completely amazed at how good the JSDF is. \\n\\n\r\n--\\n\\n\r\nSecondly, the characters. The protagonist which is not interesting in the least is given the role of an otaku just for the sake of making him relatable to the fans. This otaku is given the role of lieutenant because why not and goes off into a different world to begin forming his harem. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast is even weaker. Theres an elf girl which is looking for her dead father but she doesn't want to admit hes dead. This storyline goes nowhere. Theres The Demi-god loli which just drops everything shes doing to go off with the protagonist. Lastly theres a mage that starts to focus more on Science than what her master has been training her for in less than a couple of weeks. The rest of the cast is just there. \\n\\n\r\nThe crew the protagonist assembles are all from the other world which are all incredibly useful but somehow the protagonist in a single episodes befriends them all. These girls alone could give the JSDF a run for their money but they conveniently join sides with the Japanese which are steamrolling through their world. Logic?\\n\\n\r\nLastly the culture exchange. Thats not presented in this anime. The culture exchange is just the Mid-evil society basking in the glory of how cool and useful the japanese are. \\n\r\n--\\n\\n\r\nSome of the pros? This series had some moments where some plot points where brought out which where interesting but suddenly discarded. It failed to capitalize on its strong setting and decided to insert more harem moments instead. There was one moment which i liked where the refugee camp the japanese started was solely being turned into a small town by the residents(which are the mid-evil people that lost their homes early in the anime). The Japanese where protecting and shaping this small community and it looked like a place where both worlds life together. This aspect was rarely touched. \\n\\n\r\n--\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: This series might give you a good time if you like harem series with not much depth to it. Its an entertaining watch if not much thought is giving to it. If you where looking for a more serious anime then look away but if you where looking for some diehard army anime with explosions, One sided curbstomps and lolis then look no further.",

            "content": "This review contains minor spoilers for both the anime \"Gate: Jieitai Kanochi nite, Kaku Tatakaeri\", and the movie, \"Apocalypse Now\".\r\nRather than writing a complete review of the anime, I wanted to write an analysis of one of the scenes in it and base the review from there. The scene in question would be the famous Ride of the Valkyries scene.\r\nThe anime copies from the movie, Apocalypse Now, the scene in which Colonel Kilgore leads a regiment of helicopters to attack a village during the Vietnam war. In Apocalypse Now its the US military against the vietcong, and in Gate, its the JSDF against bandits whohave occupied the town of Italica.\\n\\n\r\nIn Gate, the JSDF are completely justified in their assault against their opponent who have terrorized the town and its inhabitants.They are the saviors, the heroes, and the song that they play during their actions, Ride of the Valkyries, brings to mind gallantry and heroism. We see the light of the sun shining behind on them as their two front helicopters dance together going side by side each other. We see and hear the leader of the bandits declaring, \"Kill them all\" to further emphasize that they are the savages, whereas the JSDF is shown to be professionals who can shoot firearms properly and work together as a team. They are the heroes fighting evil. \\n\\n\r\nIn Apocalypse Now, the US attacks a Vietnamese village with one large ulterior motive. A reward. Kilgore was reluctant at first to do the attack, but once he heard there would be a good surf spot, he's immediately for it. The soldiers even get beer if they do well enough and praise from the commanding officer, Kilgore, that they all look up to and admire. The song that plays during their assault juxtaposes what they believe they are, and what they really are. During the start, with the song playing and the helicopters blaring they are shown heroically going to battle, but we then cut to their adversary. The song is stopped short and we see schoolchildren being led to safety after their teacher hears the helicopters and whats to come with it. They aren't the good fighting the evil, they're bringing the evil.\\n\\n\r\nThis is what Gate misses from the Apocalypse now in its copy of the Ride of the Valkyries scene. Art copying from other art is completely fine, but when it is done improperly to the point where stealing is a better term, then there's something wrong. Gate is as pro-war as it can get while it copies from a movie that's completely anti-war. Apocalypse Now shows us a glimpse of the human mind descending into madness during war, while Gate tells us that going to war is fun and can get girls to like you. Gate's version of the Ride of the Valkyries scene is an insult to its original.\\n\\n\r\nThis scene alone encapsulates what Gate is. A story about the JSDF bringing justice to this new fantasy world that they've found. In the wars to come, they are the good guys triumphing against evil, with barely any loses with their superior firepower and advanced technology. Their fight isn't difficult or hard, its a simple game where they are always winning. There's no real conflict because we as the audience know for sure that they are going to end up on top. There's no in-depth portrayal of medieval fantasy vs modern military technology, there's only massacre and one-sided victories.\\n",
