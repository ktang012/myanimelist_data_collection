            "content": "I admit it, I watched this because ufotable never disappoints me when it comes to animation.  I wanted to have some eye candy, and I had.  The problem with Tales of Zestiria is that nothing is memorable, the animation is pretty decent...but, what about the story, the characters.  Where's the spirit?\r\nStory 3/10\r\nThe story is about a boy who lives in a magical world and he becomes the \"chosen one\" to defeat evil because...yeah, that's something totally original.  The story is so bad I don't even feel sympathetic with the creatures that live in this world.  The world is your typicalfantasy world: dragons, people sometimes use magic, almost everything in this world are woods and there are evil beings.  Nice.  I haven't played Tales of Zestiria, but Tales of the Abyss had a more interesting story.  I give it a 3/10 just because Tales of Berseria has a more promising story and it seems more like something I would love.  I hope we get more of Tales of Berseria on second season instead of Zestiria.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\\n\r\nYeah, it's beautiful.  It's colorful and great.  But with the awful character writing and awful situations, I would rather watch Fate/Zero again. Thanks ufotable though!\\n\\n\r\nSound 6.5/10\\n\\n\r\nSound is very good, but not really special.  It feels like an epic moment is going on when nothing special is happening.  I don't like the opening, the ending is meh.  I feel like ufotable is trying too hard with the sountrack.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 1/10\\n\\n\r\nGod, this is why I hate this show.  At least Re:Zero had some character development.  These characters are terrible.  Not even they fail to feel emotions, they fail to accomplish their stereotypes.  Genki boy Sorey is so boring, he is a good guy and wants to save everyone from evil...nice.  Mikleo is protagonist's best friend and he's always telling the protagonist how great is to explore ruins; he's also there to inform the protagonist the situation.  Pincess Alisha is a woman that I don't like just because she has no personality at all, she is just a princess. Then we have Lailah, who is there to inform the protagonist: \"that's an hellion, purify him\".  I forgot how the loli character was called, but she's terrible too.  And then we have 3 more characters that get almost no development at all.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThis show is boring.  Yeah, you get some nice animation, but that's all.  The only reason i will watch season 2 is because I would like to see some more Tales of Berseria, but if you want some eyecandy, go watch Fate/Zero.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall 5/10\\n\\n\r\nTales of Zestiria the X is a skippable anime.  I wouldn't recomment it to anyone, and I mean, I would rather watch something that doesn't bore me than this \"good vs evil in a fantasy world\" show.",

            "content": "After watching just the first few minutes of this show, I can safely say that Ufotable has once again proven that they are worthy of handling CG. Beyond the visuals, Tales of Zestiria the X is more than just another Unlimited visual porn. \r\nThe series is based on the video game of the franchise although it has its own set of principles. Early impressions of the show establishes a set-up as we meet the main protagonists \u2013 Alisha, Sorey, and Mikelo. From the setting, there are many conflicts, mostly those that revolve around the supernatural and unnatural phenomenons. In addition, the story indulges with itsfantasy setting and deep history. Of course, there\u2019s world building that has its importance. The show seems to hit the right spots from the beginning and able to stretch its story all the way through. Even early exposition doesn\u2019t bring the series down as we learn just why the world of Zestiria is so interesting.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the characters are somewhat generic, they do each have their own unique traits. For instance, Sorey is brave that puts others\u2019 well-being above his own. He isn\u2019t afraid to take risks either and we often see him go beyond lengths to get the job done. In nature, he is a classic adventurer, the type that is curious about the wonders of the world. His easygoing personality makes him easy to find new friends and thus, we see that he earns a lot of allies. Meanwhile, there\u2019s Alisha. She\u2019s a princess and knight who loves her kingdom and people. However, she does have some personal demons and is afraid of being unable to carry her responsibilities at times. Similarly to Sorey, she is courageous and isn\u2019t afraid to take risks either whether it\u2019s to put her own life at risk or getting involved in situations that puts her in disadvantageous positions. Finally, we got Mikelo, Sorey\u2019s best friend and sometimes rival. Unlike Sorey, he is very calm and often quite analytical for just about anything. This actually sets up for a duo that can compliments on each others\u2019 strengths and weaknesses. They are not just the only characters though as we meet others in the series that joins on their quest such as Liliah, Edna, and Rose. Their role in the series varies although all offer something to bring to remember by. Sorey\u2019s relationship with them is also important to note as he develops trust with Alisha while his friendship with Mikelo, Lilah, and Edna show us more of his true character. \\n\\n\r\nOne other important thing to note is that the show promotes another game from the Tales universe, Tales of Berseria. As such, expect to see main female protagonist Velvet from that game to make her presence. It share the same world as Zestiria and takes place in the Holy Midgand Empire. What\u2019s interesting about Velvet is that she is very different from the main characters form Zestiria. This is because of her role as an avenger after the tragic past she suffered at the hands of a man named Artorius. While the series doesn\u2019t conclude her main story, it does well establish Velvet\u2019s characteristics as a cold woman, a contrast to Sorey or Alisha. And even though the purpose of those episodes are just to promote the game, it really makes us wonder more about her story. I have not played the game before but Velvet definitely brings something unique to the show overall. Her stance as a vengeful warrior seeking revenge may be generic on paper but also shows just how tragedy can change a person in their world.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of world, Tales of Zestiria offers plenty of time for building more into its fantasy themes. From malevolence to devious Hellions, it has the feel of a high fantasy adventure. The kingdoms and towns themselves also have history as well so viewers won\u2019t be left stranded about being confused. There\u2019s also terms that are important to understand such as Shepherd and Seraphim. These are important as Sorey\u2019s role as a Shepherd can make great changes in their world. One other thing I want to point out is that the show isn\u2019t afraid to take risks as it sometimes bounces between calm and fast paced episodes. The pacing in general is crafted well although some plot elements are rather predictable in particular with the revelation of Rose\u2019s identity or some conclusions to the various battles.\\n\\n\r\nAnimated by Ufotable, a powerhouse studio well known for their high quality. This show does not disappoint at all when it comes to visuals. In fact, if there\u2019s anything to talk about, it would the high level production. It\u2019s basically 3D done right whether it\u2019s the character designs, the monsters (Hellions), or intense battle segments. In addition, the choreography of the character movements complements well in almost every scene with little still shot scenes. Camera angles are timed properly and there\u2019s minimal fan service. Well, you do get service in the full action packed in-your-face kind of way.\\n\\n\r\nEven the soundtrack of the series is admirable. The OP and ED theme songs are dosed with instrumental beats that will get the adrenaline pumping.  There\u2019s character voice mannerism that works quite well to fit their personalities. I have to admit that even the OST has impact on the show to add emotional value. \\n\\n\r\nTales of Zestiria the X is the kind of series that can entertain far more than just what it seems to be. It puts on a memorable world with its cast of characters on their adventures. While the story itself may or may not suit everyone\u2019s tastes, it\u2019s still quite special for a fantasy series. The show also offers a sneak peek to the world of Berseria so fans can get a taste of the game. With that being said, the series almost feels like a movie each episode. As a way to chronicle their adventures further, even a second season was announced before the finale. It\u2019s a good time to be a Tales fan.\\n",

            "content": "Tales of Zestiria the X was an anime that I, well not only me but most had been waiting for a very long time. Knowing that it was an anime from the studio Ufotable, that is known to have flawless and picturesque CG, I was very exited and thrilled about how they were going to execute the series. I haven't played the game of it, nor seen the play-through of it. Therefore it was an entirely new series for me. \r\nThe art/animation was perfect, the battle animation, the landscapes, very realistic to almost mesmerizing detail... that I had to hand down to them, it wastruly majestic to look at and the story line was simple and quite interesting.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, when its first 3 to 4 episodes got aired, honestly I was very let down by it. The story itself at the beginning was a very slow paced one which was a little bother as i had to wait one whole week for an episode, on top of it they switched the plot in the middle of the story, to Tales of Berseria at which made me really confused and took my interest out of the it at times. \\n\r\nNevertheless, Tales of Berseria was rather much enjoyable than i thought it would be, although short.  \\n\r\nMore over anything, the main aspect to what really put me off were the characters, I knowingly found the characters in Tales of Zestiria a little too what you call shallow or geeky in comparison to its counterpart to Berseria. where the flow of the characters interactions from Zestiria seemed almost forced, I was pretty annoyed by it.\\n\\n\r\nDespite everything, as the story continued past they kept on introducing new characters one after another at a great pace and that seemingly slow start started to cover up. With little to no detail to how it was all going to mix up. Slowly but surely the story finally started to dig in to as it went on, somehow I surprisingly got costumed to the shallowness of the characters, well only a little... and as the story came to its last 2 to 3 episodes my opinion about it changed and found it pretty good in-spite of its slow start. The story finally started coming to place as it came to its end.\\n\r\nOverall knowing this season was/is maybe an introduction to its sequels, i must say it was a pretty worth the time as long as they don't mess up the sequels.\\n\\n\r\nNow hoping to get the story plot to set to its main stage in the next season. What i am most excited to know is to find out what role the Tales of Berseria plays in the future.\\n\\n\r\n------------------------------------\\n\r\nOverall: 7.5\\n\r\n------------------------------------\\n\r\n-Story: 7\\n\r\n-Art: 10\\n\r\n-Sound: 8\\n\r\n-Enjoyment: 7\\n\r\n-Characters: 6\\n\\n\r\n------------------------------------\\n\\n\\n\r\n**This is my first review**",

            "content": "Have you ever had a hotdog? Its a quick and easy to prepare meal that can be enjoyed by anyone. Most people that eat a hot dog need something filling that does not take a lot of time out of their day, as they have other things to do than savor food. \r\nWell imagine if everyday as a natural routine, you bought a hot dog from a vendor. Then one day, when you bought that hot dog, you met a world class chef who offered to make a world class meal for the price of a hot dog. However, out of habit you instinctively say\"hot dog\". So the chef prepares you a world class hot dog. When you eat it, it tastes much better than any of the other   hot dogs you've ever had, but its still tastes like fast food. You've had better tasting meals from lower quality chefs, and you wonder if you wasted an opportunity. Well, in this case, Ufotable is the world class chef, Tales of Zestiria the game is the hot dog, and its anime counterpart is that wasted opportunity\\n\\n\r\nPlot: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nIt's funny, out of all the video game franchises, the Tales series seems like it is the easiest to adapt into an anime. It has character dynamics, dramatic scenes, scenes of intense suspense, and large plot lines that come together at the right moment. Except, none of these are Tales of Zestiria's strong points. The developers were much more concerned with creating unique bonus bosses and developing a customization system using items, to really care about the plot. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot itself can be summed up like this \"A member of the royal family searches for a hero that can save the land which is being swallowed by the darkness of an evil overlord. The hero leaves his isolated village and draws a magic sword to gain the powers to defeat the darkness. He visits a number of elemental temples, becomes stronger and with this power he defeats the evil overlord and saves the world\". That's pretty much it. The plot line is so generic they might as well have renamed the game \"Tales of Zelda\". There is exactly one plot twist, and it serves to pad out the game by another twenty hours before being resolved due to the final party member having just the right Macguffin to resolve the plot. How convenient!\\n\\n\r\nBecause its an adaptation, Tales of Zestiria the X, is stuck with with this stupid plot, though it deserves a 6 for at least trying. It cuts out some of the dumber elements of the game, like the scene where Sorey and Mikleo casually stand and watch as a hellion eats Mason, or when the townsmen panic when their beloved Shepherd uses his powers to help them, or when the group so brilliantly leaves the plotters of a coup attempt in power before sending the princess back to them. It's a credit to the writers that they made this bad plot watchable, if not unique or enthralling.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you are watching the anime for any reason, its this. The anime uses its material's liberal use of magic to create some absolutely breathtaking displays of art. Monsters, such as dragons are beyond comparison to their looks in other studios. The fight scenes are incredibly dynamic, from the fluid movements to the dynamic camera angles, when action actually happens all complaints about the plot disappear until after it is over.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\\n\r\nTales of Zestiria the X contains a number of different soundtracks, many of which are remixes of tracks in the game. However, they all seem to fit the mood well.  The music encapsulates all manner of emotion but the best tracks of all are the bombastic ones that occur when the group is in danger. They really make action scenes feel intense. My only complaint is their aren't enough lighthearted tracks, as the pause in music when things are calm seem kind of awkward.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nIts hard to completely judge this, since character is really dependent on a full viewing of the plot in order to gauge it properly but judging by what I've seen, its not impressive. Much of character development has a very shonen feel. If I had a dollar for every time a character said \"I want to get stronger\" I would buy Ufotable and make them animate better material. Two of the characters are very naive and there doesn't seem to be a story line that focuses on these characteristics. What's worse is that Ufotable removed the one redeeming quality about the characters in the game. In the game, the characters are at least funny. Here, they replaced it with angst, which seems like better fuel for character development but they don't do anything with it.  The anime spends 9 episodes with characters that all have the same ideals, creating a sort of echo chamber that is begging for conflict. It seems to be getting out of this rut with the introduction of Zavied and Edna, but less patient viewers might lose interest with the shows lack of humor or conflict before this point. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nTales of Zestiria the X is kind of a mixed bag for me. After playing the game, I was ready to hate the anime. However, it isn't bad by any means. Its just not spectacular. If you want to gaze at wonderful art designs and great action scenes, Tales of Zestiria the X has enough to make you come back for more, while its characters and plot are tolerable enough to watch the context without being bored.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:7/10\\n\\n\r\nTales of Zestiria the X is a good show made by a spectacular studio. This comparison leads to an obvious dip in quality that may trick viewers into thinking the show is bad. However, Tales of Zestiria's production value should not be underestimated, as this show is truly breathtaking. I only hope next time Ufotable actually checks what they are adapting next time, so they don't make the same mistake of attempting to spin something bad into something that's great and getting something that's a bit above average as a result of their hard work. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I learned two things while I was watching Tales of Zestiria the X. \r\n1: Ufotable is one of the few studios in the world who can adapt a video game properly and with extreme care\r\n2: Their visuals and animation never ceases to amaze me. \r\n[Story]: (6/10)\r\nTales of Zestiria doesn't really have the best story out there. It's nothing innovative, it's nothing new and it's been done before. I played the game and I wasn't really impressed with the game's story and it's the same case here. It wasn't shit or anything. The story was just decent, at best. It's just a story of \"Good vsEvil\" and the evil masterlord (Lord of Calamity) is going to eradicate the world and a certain someone becomes the hero that everyone needs (The Sheppard) and he will save the world from evil and darkness. There's also the \"two races that can't live side by side\" and all that other crap. I basically just summarize the whole story for you. \\n\\n\r\nThe story may not be that impressive (It wasn't shit either) but I was really impressed with the show's eyegasmic visuals and animation. The action scenes was really smooth and very appealing to watch. Whoever's the Animation Director clearly knew when to place the shots to make the fighting scenes a lot more amazing than your usual regular anime fights. Also, the action scenes' Animation Style felt really similar to another one of ufotable's works \"Unlimited Blade Works\". It's not like I'm complaining or anything since I love UBW's action scenes and I don't really care if they use their style in Tales of Zestiria. \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it\" is what I'd like to say about UBW's and Zestiria's similar Animation style. The rest of my impressions towards Zestiria's animation will be on the \"Art/Animation\" section. \\n\\n\r\nThe show moves at an extremely slow paced so I'd understand if some people ended up dropping Zestiria because the first couple of episodes can get really boring and some parts later on in the show can also get boring. Do I consider this one of the show's flaws? Ehh, not really. Due to the show's slow pacing, I was able to understand all of the information that they were throwing at me and it was easier for me to get connected with the characters and their purpose/motivations. I also prefer slow pacing so that's one of the reasons why I didn't get bored at the show. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing that I found really annoying in Zestiria is how they decided to abruptly stop Zestiria's story just to put in a Tales of Berseria advert-- I mean.. a \"special flashback\". I admit that based on the two episodes that was focused on Berseria and its characters, it was a helluva lot more interesting than what we have right now in Zestiria. The MC in Berseria \"Velvet\" is, in my opinion, a lot better than Sorey. Sorey is just an adventurous type of person and Velvet's motivation for revenge is more exciting to watch. They could have made this into an OVA but what's done is done, I suppose. \\n\\n\r\nSeeing as how there's a Berseria advertisement in-between Zestiria, it looks like Bandai Namco funded this series solely just to advertise Berseria. Then again, why would ufotable go through all these trouble just to try and  change the original game's storyline into something good. Hell, they even gave Alisha a lot more character in the anime compared to the game plus the anime is getting a 2nd Season. So I think this adaptation is a little bit of both. Advertising and they (most likely) wanted to do Zestiria justice in terms of its story and characters because the game suffered from both aspects, more so in the characters department *ahem Alisha in the game sucks major ass ahem*.  \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: (10/10)\\n\r\nAfter watching Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works, I thought ufotable has reached their peak in terms of what they can do with the Animation. I thought that they already reached the ceiling since improving the Animation even further might turn their future series from 2D Animation to 3D Animation. I guess I was wrong. As of this writing, Tales of Zestiria the X has better Animation than any anime I've seen that was released in the past 5 or more years. Everything from their outstanding visuals, impressive character designs, very smooth action scenes and their almost-perfect utilization of CGI into 2D Animation. Just watching Episode 0 alone, I thought I was watching a fucking anime movie. That's how perfect Zestiria's Animation was.  \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Sound]: (9.5/10)\\n\r\nI am SO GLAD that ufotable decided to keep the game's OST in the anime adaptation. The game's OST was beautiful (right up there with Final Fantasy's OST, if I say so myself) and hearing the OST in the anime version (Sorey's theme, anyone?) made me glad that they kept it in the adaptation. It felt like I was playing the game all over again except this time, I wasn't controlling Sorey or any of my party members and I don't have to go through those boring-ass dungeons. Man, I can't wait till the 2nd Season reaches to \"that\" point where the \"Rising Up\" song plays. It's going to be fucking hype if they actually use that song in the 2nd Season but that's all I'm going to say. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP theme song is \"Kaze no Uta\" by FLOW. I'm going to piss off a lot of fans here (probably) but I love the anime's OP way more than the game's OP. Don't get me wrong, I also like \"White Light\" but Kaze no Uta is just a whole lot better for me. The chorus, the buildup to the chorus, the first few sec. of the OP that sounds like some hymn from a church, and FLOW is why I love this song and this is also in my Top 3 Anime OP this year. \\n\r\nThe ED theme song is \"calling\" by fhana. I actually heard fhana's performance first in HaruChika's OP and that song sounded really good so I couldn't wait to hear her performance here in Zestiria. Once again, she delivered. I really love her high notes and her beautiful voice. \\n\\n\r\nI played the game in English so it would make perfect sense for me to watch the show in English Dub so I did. I'm honestly surprised that FUNimation managed to get all the cast from the game back since most of the VA's don't even live in Texas and while Funi said that the original VA for Mikleo didn't return, I'm willing to bet my life that he did because his voice in the anime sounds EXACTLY like him. I'm pretty sure the original VA for Mikleo used a pseudonym because he's part of the union. Finally, as expected from FUNi's dubs, their voice acting was really good. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Characters]: (7/10)\\n\r\n[Skip the first paragraph if you don't want to read my rant about Alisha's role in the game]\\n\r\nI really appreciate what ufotable is doing to Alisha in this anime adaptation. In the game, she's supposed to be the main heroine of the series. In the trailers and even the advertisements, they portrayed her as the main heroine. You know, as someone who's going to be important in the Zestiria storyline. Then I played the game.....Yea....I was disappointed with what they did to Alisha. Appearantly, whoever's the director of the game had some fucking gripe with Alisha that he didn't bother giving Alisha that much development in the 1st half of the game and later on, she left and never came back. They even released an \"Alisha DLC\" as a sort of apology to the fans but I was even more disappointed with the DLC. The only saving grace of that DLC was me being able to control Alisha but every part of that DLC sucks. (Don't even get me started on that long, tedious boring-ass dungeon that took me over an hour to get through)\\n\\n\r\nSo going back to my point, I'm glad that ufotable did Alisha, in this adaptation, justice. She got a helluva lot more screentime and character development in the anime compared to the game. Hell, Episode 0 (which was anime original) tells me that ufotable is doing everything they can to show the viewers (and the fans of the game) that she's the main heroine of Zestiria. Not Rose and not Mikleo (Don't even ask me \"Isn't Mikleo a guy?\" because that's the joke). Alisha in the game came off as \"that character\" who I didn't give a shit about and Alisha in the anime version came off as an independent badass princess who'll do anything to achieve her ideals and I actually cared more about Alisha while I was watching Zestiria than playing Zestiria. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the protagonist of the series. Sorey, as the MC, is not that impressive. Sorey is just a pure-hearted person who is an adventurous type of person but after learning about the relationship between Humans and Seraphims and after he became the Sheppard, he vowed to saved the world from the Lord of Calamity and to also restore the relationship between both races. Like I haven't seen his type before. Velvet, the MC of Tales of Berseria, is already better than Sorey just by watching the two episode special. Her goals and motivations are more intriguing than Sorey. Moving on, Sorey got a decent amount of character development in this season but he'll get more focus in the 2nd Season but he doesn't get any better. \\n\\n\r\nFor the rest of the characters, you know how when you play an RPG, your party expands the more you play the game? It's the same case here. Throughout the series, they each join Sorey's party because they have the same goals and ideals or Sorey offers to help solve their problem. They don't really get that much character development though. The only reason why I like them are their personalities.  \\n\\n\r\nOne minor aspect that I didn't like was how ufotable removed and/or skipped most of the funny side of the characters. Yes, I know that they made up for it by showing the characters' funny side in the post-credit \"Skit\" scene but to me, that wasn't really enough. For example, Edna wasn't being \"Edna: best girl\" (In the game, she was fucking hilarious) after she got introduced. However, in the post-credit scene, that's when Edna (sort-of) truly shines and shows off why she's the best girl.\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]: (8/10)\\n\r\nDespite the decent-but-not-so-impressive storyline, I still enjoyed Zestiria because of its breathtaking and visually appealing animation. Watching the show just for its characters and the animation was enough for me. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[VERDICT]\\n\r\nI'm amazed at how how ufotable handled the adaptation. They managed to adapt a video game-series that I didn't like that much, in terms of its story and some characters, and turned it into a good video game adaptation. They also handled Alisha better than how the game handled her and honestly, I can finally say that Alisha is better than Rose. Edna is still the best girl though :P. The anime also gave off that \"I'm playing an RPG\" vibe and it's very rare for a video game adaptation to give off that vibe for me. Now the wait for the 2nd Season begins \\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]: (8.2/10)\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+A very rare, good video game adaptation\\n\r\n+Alisha is handled better in the anime version than the game\\n\r\n+Re-use of awesome soundtracks from the game\\n\r\n+Outstanding and Visually Appealing Animation\\n\r\n+Impressive utilization of CGI into 2D Animation\\n\r\n+Action scenes gives off multiple but pleasant \"Eyegasms\" \\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Not-so-impressive storyline\\n\r\n-Sorey, as the MC, is meh\\n\r\n-Not a lot of character development for most of the main characters.",

            "content": "(Before i start reviewing this show, i will clear out something, my english is not perfect, so if i commit mistakes, i'm sorry).\r\nWell, i started this show because i LOVE the Tales series, and i finished the game a week before this came out and getting kinda dissapointed with it, and after knowing that this will be different than the game's plot, i decided to give it a chance. \r\nStory: 6/10\r\nWell, the story from the beginning is kinda clitche, Sorey (MC) becomes the sheperd and goes on a adventure with his seraph friends to save the world, i liked that they made the world actuallylooking like it's going to be destroyed soon if Sorey doesn't do something (Something that the game doesn't do), and liked how the story connects with Berseria\\n\\n\r\nThere's also 2 episodes that tells the beginning of Berseria, the problem here is that they're 2 full episodes of filler, as they're not important in any way to the plot.\\n\\n\r\nAnd here's the big problem with the show, the pasing is REALLY slow for no apparent reason, the characters keep talking about things that doesn't matter to the plot, and i know, it's to develop the characters, but sometimes this long exposition really doesn't go anywhere, and feels like it's just there to make time, if you remove all this scenes, the show could have been a lot better. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nCome on, it's Ufotable. It's obvious that everything that they made looks beatiful, the only reason i don't give it a 10 it's because Fate which came before, looks a bit better.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nI'm not a professional on this aspect, but i think it's fine. But a problem i noticed is that sometimes the show decides to use music from the game, and feels a bit out of place sometimes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10\\n\r\nThe problem with the characters, is that they're extremely plain, Sorey is the tipical goodie two shoes that wants to save the world, Mikleo is your tipical tsundere who can't be 2 feet separated from Sorey, Alisha i just simply hate her because how boring she is, and the rest of the characters don't get enough screen time or develop to really care about them. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nAs a fan of the series, i enjoyed the series. But if you're not a fan or don't like slow pased shows, just avoid this show, because it's not for you.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\r\nIt's better than the game, at least.",

            "content": "Note: I watched the show first, played the game, and then rewatched some episodes afterwards. Therefore, most of my commentary is going to be based on how well the adaptation conveyed information with respect to in-game elements (skits, townsmen info, etc.).\r\nThe biggest concern I had with this show is with the pacing, since I didn't know how much of the game this first season would cover and with 2/12 episodes dedicated to Tales of Berseria. S1 barely covers the first few hours of the game; Sorey does not have his \"full party\" yet, and has only learned of the main antagonist towards the ending. I'mnot sure how many more seasons Zestiria the X will have, but they did completely change some game events (not only for the reduction of battle or exploration game time) and mixed in information learned later in game with some semi-angsty/dramatic flashbacks upon the arrival of a new character. Hopefully that will help convert some dense game time into a few 20-minute episodes, but even prior to playing to the game, everything from information to changes of scenery seemed a little rushed.\\n\\n\r\nDespite of this fast pacing, the anime managed to flesh out the characters in a way that the game hasn't. One big example is Alisha, the Knight-Princess who has two countries worth of problems and then some. At the ending of S1 she barely joins the party, but in game Sorey and company have on and off encounters with her prior to that, which doesn't give much game or screen time for the viewer/player to get a feel of her character past being an honest person with a sense of duty. The anime made her much more proactive by showing scenes from her point of view, something the game can't achieve as well since it's mostly Sorey's POV, limited to the player's choice of interaction, and most character-building is through skits and a few cutscenes.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, overall character personalities have taken a bit of a hit from the fast pacing because they come off as more serious. Yes the situations they deal with aren't very pleasant to begin with, but since very little to none of the side skits aren't integrated into the anime-- so far, at least-- all the camaraderie seen in game (of almost everyone ragging on everyone else in the group, consciously or not) hasn't been conveyed as well. At most Sorey's and Mikleo's friendship was given the most screentime to develop and conveyed their deep childhood friendship, but even then it went from the game's overly-protective-and-teasing-friendship to melodramatic scenes and cradle-holding. However, like I said, S1 only covers so little of the first few hours of the game, so maybe S2 will change that.\\n\\n\r\n--\\n\\n\r\nStory/Character: 7~7.5/10\\n\r\nCliche hero with a heart pure of gold who's an archaeology geek/history buff. Personally I like pure-hearted protags, and Sorey earns more points because I like dead things too. Also, it's not said within this season, but that pure heart of his plays a large factor in later events. The episode explaining what it really means to purify humans-turned-hyouma as a Shepherd is a bit of a preview of many struggles to come. As previously mentioned, also like how the anime adds a bit of depth to characters in comparison to how the game handled them, but it might not be as great for viewers who have only or who are only planning on watching the anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nEverything is gorgeous. Everyone is gorgeous. Even the CGI monsters were pretty great. 11/10 for you, Ufotable.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nIt's pretty good, I guess. Like the utilization of various zone/battle music from the game in the scenes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nMostly suffered from pacing. I also didn't like how 2 Berseria episodes were stuck in the middle of the season, no matter how good their story is. That would've stuck out like a sore thumb especially if I had been watching Zestiria the X on a weekly basis.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.5~8/10\\n\r\nThis show is basically a huge advertisement for the Zestiria and Berseria games. It did pretty damn well with that goal in mind.",

            "content": "First of all although i have played the game that serves as the source material for the anime i haven't completed it. Additionally the anime expands a lot of what was only shown and mentioned in the game and diverges a lot from it so at this point whether or not i finished it is a bit mute. \r\nThe main story of Tales of Zestiria revolves around the story of the Shepard and more precisely the story of the newest Shepard who in this is the main character Sorey.  The Shepard is supposed to a powerful figure that has the power to interact witha spirit race called the seraphim and in conjunction protect the world by ridding it of malevolence and defeat the one responsible for causing them which is the lord of calamity. \\n\\n\r\nThe story follows the journey of Sorey as he explores the land and meeting the lands many people while at the same time cleansing them of Malevolence. At the same time Sorey and co find themselves tied to the fate of the kingdom that they currently travel in. \\n\\n\r\nSorey is the main character of the series and though in the beginning he was a rather plain character that was always willing to explore new areas this changed when he become the Shepard. In the beginning Sorey was honest, kind and loved to explore the old ruins that were located near his home. As the only human within the seraphim settlement that he lived in he was able to see the normally invisible race and establish a kinship with them. Sorey had since he was little looked up to and respected the race thanks to a ancient book that he had read and continues to read and believes that despite past events the seraphims and humanity would once again work together once more like they did in the past. \\n\\n\r\nOnce Sorey becomes the Shepard his personality underwents some changes. Although still positive and kind Sorey becomes determined to end the malevolence that plagues the land to protect the weak and the helpless from it. Although Sorey still has a lot to learn about being a Shepard he tries to learn all he can and think though things before committing to an action. \\n\\n\r\nSorey can be stubborn at times but often this to to help a friend or people that need help. One aspect that i like about Sorey is his restraint in that he understands that killing would create more malevolence and in turn create more hatred meaning that no matter how much someone deserves it Sorey shouldn't kill him. In the anime there were instances where Sorey could have ended these people there but instead held back and only purified them something that i respect him for. \\n\\n\r\nMikleo is Soreys best friend and is a seraphim from the village that Sorey grew up in. Unlike Sorey Mikleo is calm and collected and not given to rash action. He's usually the voice of caution within the party. In the beginning Mikleo was the sole spirit user in the group and advised Sorey on everything and was especially wary of humans due to limited contact with them. He was also wary of the role of a Shepard and did not wish for Sorey to become one. \\n\\n\r\nHowever this misgiving changed when he saw how Sorey excelled at being one. In the beginning Mikleo's spirit power was relatively weak and therefore could only provide limited support to Sorey. This was a fact that bothered him a lot that he managed to solve by finding an ancient artifact that was suggested by Lailah that boosted his powers a lot. Mikleo's interactions with Edna a fellow seraph was pretty funny though. \\n\\n\r\nAlisha is one of the main characters of the show and is the princess of the kingdom of Hyland. Alisha is kind, caring, intelligent and detests war and the suffering that it brings. She is loyal to her country and strives to protect its people. As a member of the royal family Alisha often find's herself having to\\n\r\ndeal with the countries politicians in the ruling of the country especially among the warmongers. Because she detests war she does not advocate starting wars or fighting them. Alisha can be stubborn at times especially \\n\r\nwhen she tries to help people a trait that i admire about her.\\n\\n\r\nDespite being a princess Alisha is also a fully trained knight and is a capable combatant with her spear able to fight members of the assassin guild that was hired to kill her on even terms. \\n\\n\r\nAlisha believes wholeheartedly in the existence of the seraphs and their eventual return to help Humanity in their hour of need. As such Alisha has a good relationship with Sorey and believes in him and respects his\\n\r\nopinions greatly. \\n\\n\r\nAlisha is portrayed by veteran seiyuu Ai Kayano who is one of my top ten fav seiyuu's of all time. Her performance here was just as amazing as always.\\n\\n\\n\r\nLailah is a fire spirit and a seraph that acted as the guardian for the sword that people must pull out if they wished to become a Shepard. Wise, kind and beautiful Lailah despite being centuries old still looks to be someone in early adulthood. Within the story Lailah acts as one of Sorey's main advisers \\n\r\nand teaches him on the duties of a Shepard and whats involved. Despite this she is patient with this and teaches Sorey slowly so as to not overload him with info. \\n\\n\r\nWhen Lailah doesn't want to talk about something she \\n\r\nabruptly changes topic while smiling something that i find quite funny. \\n\r\nAs a fire spirit she attacks with pages from a book that she wields that incorporates flames in their attacks.\\n\\n\r\nWithin the anime Lailah was voiced by veteran seiyuu Noriko Shitaya who replaced the seiyuu that played her in the game Miyu Matsuki who sadly passed away before the anime started. Within the anime Lailah along with Alisha is one of my fav characters largely due to their respective seiyuu's. Here Noriko Shitaya of Fate stay night fame did a fantastic job portraying Lailah whether being the witty and calm Lailah outside of battle or the serious and wise one during battle she truly excelled. \\n\\n\r\nEdna is a seraph and is aligned with the power of Earth. Appearance wise Edna is pretty and petite on the outside but in the inside she detests humans. However this changes somewhat after she meets Sorey because he was different. \\n\\n\r\nPersonality wise Edna can be cold and merciless at times but to friends and people that she respects she can be warm to them. Her character has some interesting interactions with Mikleo. Although Edna was skeptical of Sorey \\n\r\nlike a lot of people she does eventually warm up to him after seeing his determination and courage.\\n\\n\r\nRose is a main character and a human being. Appearance wise Rose is a teenage girl of average height and short red hair and appears to be a merchant or at least part of a company that does that. However this is not actually the case. Rose is a interesting character in that she actually has two persona's that she presents depending on her role. In normal form she is polite,devious and sneaky at times. In  her alternate form she is serious, logical and lethal with her weapons. In this season Rose wasn't given much of a large role and as such its difficult to judge her character.\\n\\n\r\nZaveid and Dezel are two seraph's that Sorey and co meet during the course of the anime. Zaveid and Dezel are both wind users though they have different personalities. Zaveid's personality is more like a trickster as he isn't loyal to anyone compared to the other seraphs. Within the anime\\n\r\nSorey and co meet Zaveid at the same time that they meet Edna as both were engaged with a dragon that they both knew. And both had reasons to face it. In this season neither was give much of role and its difficult to see and judge their characters with regards to the story. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation as expected of Ufotable the makers of the fate stay night series  is top notch and clear with the fight scenes being the most impressive. Art style was pretty good overall and i felt that the character \\n\r\ndesigns were well designed and were largely faithful to the source material. \\n\\n\r\nMusic was generally good across the anime with scene to scene music being appropriate. Opening and ending themes i felt were especially good. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Tales of Zestiria was a great anime that had top notch animation, great story, interesting characters and stellar voice acting from a talented cast. I was overjoyed to hear that there will be a season 2 to this anime. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Tales of Zestiria the X ... When I found out they're making an anime based on the game I really liked , naturally I got pretty excited although I wasn't expecting anything phenomenal but the anime was better than what I expected . Of course it doesn't live up to the game but it is pretty good by itself . Let's talk about the anime , the story covers almost half of the game which is expected since they confirmed second season's production . It's consisted of 3 episodes about the upcoming Tales of Berseria and other 9 episodes are based on the Tales OfZestiria . The story narration is far from perfect as it skips through most stuff happened in the game but is pretty good if you consider it's based on a game :/ . The fighting scenes are made with a lot of consideration and contain lots of drama but the relation between characters isn't how it should be and it's because of the 9 episodes they had which isn't much to work on . The characters themselves are pretty good but again they don't have much time to work on the relation in between and some scenes feel a bit awkward esp. introducing Edna which was so hasty that you don't get any feelings toward her . There is the sound which is really good not only the opening and ending but the background music and sound esp. in fighting scenes are praiseworthy . Then there is the art and it is absolutely STUNNING . It is by far the best one I've seen , every detail is considered in the art and it feels really perfect the colorings esp. are really good . The show is quite enjoyable contrary to what I expected and is worth your time :)",

            "content": "Ufotable.  The name of the production company has an army of fans in its wake from the kind of quality that their adaptations have been able to produce.  From story to soundtrack to the oh so god-like animation with a seemingly unlimited budget for just how well produced is looks, very little can be said about Ufo that hasn't already been said before.  And so, we come to their newest project, Tales of Zestiria the X, a game adaptation from one of the \"Tales of\" games about a boy's journey to purge the world of malevolence.\r\nStory: The world of Zestiria is plaguedby great malevolence created from the negative and depressing emotions that come from all sources such as nature and people that taints the world and things that live in them to become hellions, demonized versions of the various beings'.  It is here where we in this world populated by people and mythical beings known as Seraphim that we follow Sorey, the Shepherd better known as the one who will purge the world from the malevolence.\\n\\n\r\nZestiria's story...isn't all that exciting admittedly.  With only 12 episodes to try and tell the story or at least part of the story of a game that's ~100 hours (because lol, JRPGs) the actual content in the show doesn't really go that far into the series.  Very few things of significance actually happen over the course of the story, and the majority of the runtime involves a lot of talking and lore/world building as Sorey adapts to his new role as the 'Shepherd'.  As a result of that, Zestiria severely lacks a story that progresses at an even pace since the whole span of the series is pretty much a slow but detailed crawl to the planned stopping point.  \\n\\n\r\nIn addition to that, the middle of the series takes a really strange turn that apparently has a reason for doing it, but I think it would've been better to not do it in the first place.  Anyway, the strange turn comes in the form of two of the middle two episodes in the series where the show switches GAMES and spends some time on another Tales of game, Tales of Berseria.  As to why they did this, I have no idea, but personally, I would've preferred if they didn't do it in the first place and spent that runtime doing something with the main story rather than using it for something that to someone that doesn't know much about the series, doesn't really make all that sense.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the story of Zestiria is pretty basic.  Sure you have some good lore elements and world-building that many fantasy shows can only dream of, but the trade-off to that is the fact that the series doesn't really go far enough to have anything significant happen.  The journey of Sorey and his Seraphim companions is just barely past the starting line by the time we finish the last episode, which does hamper the series because it really doesn't feel like we got anywhere aside from the expositional chapter.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Interesting world building and lore\\n\r\n-  Weird Berseria insert that felt out of place\\n\r\n-  Pretty basic story and premise all around\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:  The characters that we're introduced to in Zestiria vary pretty wildly from being almost non-existent to being part of the main cast without really much to say about them.\\n\\n\r\nFirst we have Sorey, the new Shepherd and main protagonist of the series.  Sorey's vision and overall character revolves around the ideal of bringing Seraphim and humans together.  As your stereotypical, noble hero who wishes nothing but good in the world, Sorey is a pretty innocent and all-around generic hero character.  Sure he gets development later in the series when he finally sees what his duties as a Shepherd are, but it's not so heavily put that it severely alters his character in any way.\\n\\n\r\nThen there're the Seraphim companions that Sorey meets along his journey, starting with his friend (and possibly most popular ship partner) Mikleo, the delusional and adorable Lailah, and the kuudere loli of the group, Edna.  To be honest, there's not much to say about any of these three since they're all about the same in terms of development.  They're Sorey's companions and both add quips and exposition to the story as needed.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, we have the princess of the town of Ladylake, Alisha.  With a strong sense of duty and a responsibility to take care of the people as the princess, Alisha is rarely used in the series.  She becomes the first human that Sorey interacts with, and there're some nice moments involving the two characters, but as a character, Alisha doesn't actually do much.  \\n\\n\r\nFrankly, none of these characters really do anything.  Trust me, there is a plot to this series, but the fact of the matter is that the show doesn't truly have anything to create any form of character development for any of the characters.  The side characters are pretty minimal and since the entire series is just basically the tutorial part of the game before you just get into the meat of it with every party member and every mechanic unlocked, there's really nothing that can be said for these characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+/-  Characters are interesting, but are all pretty minimal.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Ok, so uh...I swear the 10/10 thing in the art rating isn't a mistake.  As expected, Ufotable pulled out all of the stops to make this series look goddamn amazing.  And you know what?  It DOES look goddamn amazing.  The series looks similar to the style of animation that they gave Fate: UBW (compared to what they did to God Eater), and fluently meshes the bright and varied color palette with the mixture of CGI and handdrawn animation that's a work of art.  (There's even a town scene with several thousand tiny people walking with more than just 2 two cycling frames.  That's dedication if I've ever seen it.)\\n\\n\r\nAlso, as expected, the fight scenes look amazing.  They're fluent, they're engaging, and they have amazing effects that go along with Sorey's armantization forms that are beyond beautiful to look at.  Hell, the animation alone made me forget about all of the other aspects of the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Ufotable's artwork.  (Nothing else is needed here.)\\n\\n\r\nSound:  Kaze no Uta by Flow, the OP for Zestiria, is by far my favorite track in the entirety of the Summer 2016 season.  The adventurous and fantasy tone of the series was captured and has that kind of energy that makes you want to pick up a sword and defeat the Lord of Calamity yourself.  It's an invigorating piece that perfectly encapsulates the feel of the series and is an addicting song that'll probably on repeat for a few hours.  On the other hand, you have fhana's 'Calling', a song that's more mellow than its OP counterpart.  It's pretty standard fare for the singer and her band, so there's not really much to say for it, especially when you compare it to its OP partner.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is admittedly average at best.  It's good, but there's not really much to say for it or anything that needs special mention.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ KAZE NO UTA!  \\n\r\n+/-  Rest of the soundtrack was ok\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: Despite the show's flaws, this was definitely one of the more enjoyable series that I've seen all season.  Don't get me wrong, the fact that the story basically goes nowhere and the fact that nothing major actually happens throughout its runtime isn't a good thing, but damn, if you can make someone look forward to seeing more exposition and only a tiny inch towards the end, than you're...probably doing something right.  \\n\\n\r\nDid I like this series?\\n\\n\r\nOh yes.  I probably enjoyed it far more than I should've but hey, no matter its flaws, enjoying a show is still enjoying a show.  That being said, I'd probably lean towards the armatizations and other aspects of the fight scenes more to be my favorite parts of the series.  Oh, and the preview scenes that happen after the credits.  Those were pretty fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this series?\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, despite its numerous flaws, there's not really much of anything I hate.  Critically, the show has a lot of things that aren't so well-executed, but from the enjoyment side of things, this show was way more fun than it had any right to be.  (Especially the weird cut-in with the Berseria part.)\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this series?\\n\\n\r\nIf you want some good artwork, and you've already seen every other one of Ufotable's work, than Tales of Zestiria is a good choice to go for.  Personally, I'd say it's worth to consider its series purely for the art and the series's aesthetics.  They're so well made that you'll probably forget that the series only went to two towns and a mountain rather than any huge stretch of the adventure.  Actually though, in my opinion, this series is a ton of fun to watch.",

            "content": "The more time passes, the harder it gets to create an anime that truly stand out in their genre and most of them end up being very similar to their predecessors, only less memorable. With that in mind, Tales of Zestiria doesn't even try to set itself apart from all the other fantasy anime and ends up being a story that has been done 1000 times before and 1000 times better.\r\nLet's start with the story. Firstly, the setting couldn't be more generic. At first, it seemed interesting, because it was a village where these mythical beings known as Seraphim live and had some mystical ruinsthat revealed an ancient prophecy. But then the characters travel to a city that you feel like you've seen before, and after that to various locations with no personality (mostly wastelands and forests) that don't feel like they have any significance to the world or story.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing it too slow for an anime like this, and that wouldn't be a problem if the time in between fights wasn't filled with completely uninteresting dialogue that doesn't presentany interesting ideas and just exists so that there wouldn't be silence all the time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the story is all over the place and doesn't go in any direction. The characters would just travel to random locations and get rid of minor villains in order to make the world better. That might sound interesting to the casual viewer, but to me it's nothing that i haven't heard before. I never felt like there was a huge threat that needs to be defeated or a huge goal that needs to be achieved, and that is something indispensable in a great fantasy series. the conflict needs to feel epic and have a massive scale, i want to feel like the fate of the world is in the hands of these characters. They do talk about a war, which will probably happen in the nex season, but i never felt the urgency of this conflict approaching.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the characters, where should i even start? Our main character is a typical righteous guy who becomes \"The chosen one\" and strives to make the world a better place, without having any personality beyond that. Does that motivation sound interesting? Because to me, it doesn't. It is so vague and overused that it's become obnoxious. I can't care for him if he doesn't have a grand goal in his life. Naruto wants to be hokage, Luffy wants to find One Piece, Ed and Al want their bodies back, Guts wants revenge on Griffith and to bring Casca back to normal, why couldn't they give something like that to Sorey? \\n\\n\r\nAt first, he seemed like an acceptable character, but only until he dropped the line \"We don't have to kill them\" (referring to people that turned into evil monsters). That's when i almost lost all hope for this charaacter and realised he's just another righteous MC who tries to save everyone and doesn't understand that victory cannot come without sacrifice. This type of character can be done right, for example in shows like Fate/zero and Magi, by killing an important character and making the MC realise how delusional he was, thus helping with his development. But surprise, surprise, nobody dies in this anime because of the almighty plot armor.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast is even less memorable, because they have no personality at all and they are limited to their interactions and relationswith Sorey. They barely express any emotion and even when they do, it doesn't feel real because i don't care about them.\\n\\n\r\nNot to mention the villains are forgettable and not menacing a all, because there is no build-up before any confrontation and they are defeated with ease and no casualties on the side of the good guys.\\n\\n\r\nI have to give some credit to the action scenes. They were beautifully animated, with lots of particles flying around and giving a surreal feeling to the fights, and were mildly enjoyable throughout. However, i couldn't feel any tension during the fights or care too much about them, for reasons that i've mentioned above. I just didn't feel the weight of the situation or the stakes involved.\\n\\n\r\nUndoubtedly the strongest point of this anime was its art style. Not only did it fit the setting, giving it that ethereal aspect of a fantasy world, but it was also detailed and colorful without feeling saturated. The character and costume designs were impressively unique. Ever character was instantly recognisable just from their looks and clothing.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the soundtrack, it was fitting and immersive, contributing a lot to the overall atmosphere, but no track really stood out to me. All of the songs could have been used in any other fantasy anime and wouldn't be easily recognisable, unlike the dramatic choirs of Attack on Titan, the oriental music of Magi or the epic guitar riffs mixed with traditional japanese flute from Naruto.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, i found this anime as more of a weekly chore than an enjoyable watch, and i wouldn't recommend it, because for everything that it does, another anime does it better. You want an immersive and fascinating world with unique settings creatures? Watch Magi. You want great characters that can turn even a simple story into an amazing experience? Watch Rage of Bahamut. You want epic and beautifully animated fight scenes? Watch the Fate series. You want all of those in one? Watch FMA: Brotherhood. There are so many alternatives that i don't see why you would watch this instead.",

They are easily one of the top 3 studios for quality visuals. The only reason thing that could have been improved visually was the CGI dragons which felt a bit odd most of the time. Obviously this is ridiculously hard to get right though.\r\nMusic 7/10\r\nMusic was pretty generic and is more suited to a game, reminded me greatly of Dark Souls III wouldn't be surprised if it was the same composer(s). I enjoy this sort of music buta lot of people don't so it's a love it or hate it sort of deal.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters, Story, everything else 4/10\\n\\n\r\nWith all the awesome visuals in the world you can't make a boring story with boring character much less... boring.\\n\r\nI gave this anime a chance as I usually do when I hear something is mediocre, and more so because of Ufotable. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, with the story they had to work with I don't think they had much hope for success with this. The story is so generic, with generic characters and generic story progression. There isn't much that stands out sadly. \\n\\n\r\nOf course this was based on a game and I guess it follows that story so it can't stray too far from the source material which is it's major downfall. This story just isn't meant for this medium, it's meant for games where you can feel the progression. If they had rewritten the story to work well with anime I think it would have had potential.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR\\n\\n\r\nThis anime looks absolutely breathtaking as expected of Ufotable. However, the story is bland and generic, with characters just as generic and has nothing that grabs you, and makes you want to keep watching.",

She doesn't even have to go full Princess Usako and send him to \u201cprison island.\u201d In any case, time passes. She doesn't hear from the soldier she sent. So she takes several soldiers and goes to investigate herself. This eventually results in her finding her way to a strange land called Elysia where, supposedly, seraphim live. But all she can see are a bunch of buildings and a human boy about her age named Sorey. Sorey wants humans and seraphim to go back to living side by side and seems to see something in Elysia that Alisha can't.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest issue with this series is just that a lot of the plot points are pretty predictable. Of course, the boy who can see the seraphim goes to the sword festival and turns out to be the Shepherd. But that's not the extent of it. Nearly every plot point that they resolve in the first series goes exactly where you'd think it would. There's all of one moment where the narrative might surprise you. And even if that moment does, it's a very safe surprise. The series seems very hesitant to deviate too far from the conventional, generic path. The politics of the world are kind of unclear too. Now, in all fairness, the game does explain why the monarchy doesn't wield much power or respect and Bartlow can just be a dick towards the princess, but the anime never really addresses it. The problem being that it's kind of an important detail for understanding the story. Then we have the Velvet Crowe episodes. They aren't bad episodes by any metric but they are very much out of place. Basically, we get part of a completely different story inserted into this one for seemingly no reason. Unless the second series decides to have the two plot lines intersect, but that seems unlikely since Velvet is from a different game entirely.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending is a bit mixed. On one hand, it has some strong moments for the series and it does do a good job of giving some resolution while opening things up for a second series. However, it also suffers from having one of those \u201cthe antagonist has a chance to end the threat presented by the protagonist but decides not to bother for flimsy reasons\u201d moments. And those only really work in media for children. Not so much in something like this that's aimed at teens.\\n\\n\r\nOn the positive side, the series does do a good job at introducing enough plot elements to keep you invested in what's going on. The random Berseria episodes aside, it is well paced. I will also give them credit for having well executed plot points, even if they are obvious. I also do like the allusions to Arthurian legend.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are pretty decent. The issue that holds them back from being really good is that the main cast is only a step or two above archetypes, at least by the time the series ends. It's entirely possible that the second series of Zestiria will further develop their characters and make them more interesting. They certainly develop a bit in this one. They have conflicts, motivations and some pretty strong relationships. Particularly betwixt Sorey and Mikleo. The antagonists are just bland with no real sense of personality.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork in this is really good. The action sequences are really well done. The backgrounds are nicely detailed. The character designs can be silly in that JRPG aesthetic but they don't look bad. About the worst you get are the dumb feathers randomly clipped to Sorey's ears. In general, the worst thing I can say for the art is that it does feature some highly conspicuous CG moments. Which can be distracting.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe cast in this is really good. Kayano Ai, Koyasu Takehito, Satou Rina, Osaka Ryota & Shitaya Noriko all do really well in their roles. And there aren't any weak performances. The music is quite good.\\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nThere's not a whole lot. The series has the occasional scene that reads a tiny bit like homo-erotic subtext. Usually involving Alisha.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nthat's the first series of Tales of Zestiria the X. It has its strong moments. It has the basics down very well with the sound and art. The story, however, suffers from multiple bizarre decisions. Having a part of Berseria randomly inserted into the narrative. Not explaining the details you need to understand Alisha's circumstances. The series also really hasn't done enough to develop its characters at this juncture. Maybe if they'd done that instead of showing us a part of a completely different narrative for no reason. Still, it's a decent start and I am curious about the second series. I'll probably review that at some point after it's finished airing. But, for this one, I give it a 6/10. If you're a fan of the Tales franchise or even just fantasy works in general, give it a try. Next Week I'll look at Futari wa Precure Splash Star.",

            "content": "Short review: This anime has awesome graphics and shit story. \r\nDetailed review: I have been offended by many anime but never has an anime made me so angry. When it started, I thought to myself this anime might be just amazing. Oh boy was I wrong. It probably has one of the best graphics out there and they just go to waste as the story seems to be written by a teenager who is full of his own shit. I think the main audience for this show were stupid teenagers? But that's still no excuse for such horrible plot and story writing. The anime triesto be very philosophical but then it explains itself how the ideologies of the main characters is fucking bullshit. They try to add action in their anti-war philosophy and it's ridiculous. The action itself is awesome and entertaining. But it has the least amount of screen time and it doesn't fit well with the perspective of the story. Mostly the anime is filled with exposition scenes and even they are done horribly. And how characters interact seems so forced and fake that it gets on my nerves. And the overall plot is very predictable for first episodes. They meet new characters; the generic characters you'd except to join the group. You think to yourself that I bet they'll join the group and they do. Not to mention in the most ridiculous way. \"You should leave this place.\" \"Well I was thinking about that. Where are you going?\" \"I am going to find my friend.\" \"O lovely stranger, that I met 2 minutes ago, I want to come with you like we're the bestest friends. Also fist me daddy.\" (The character didn't necessarily say that but I am sure the scene would be on the same level of ridiculousness if that was said.)  This shit is fucking awful. To be honest it might not be so bad but the thing is I REALLY HATE THE FACT THEY PUT SO MUCH WORK INTO THIS SHIT. THE ART AND ACTION ARE SO AMAZING AND THE PLOT JUST MAKES YOU WANT TO BASH YOUR HEAD IN THE WALL. It's just very frustrating. And I forgot to mention the fact that the show is very terrible at trying to make us feel for the characters. They get a problem and it's treated to be unsolvable. You see the characters try again and then boom, they did it. They finally removed the great obstacle that they were having a lot of difficulty solving before. I mean HOW? HOW?? YOU LITERALLY FAILED DOING THE SAME SHIT A MINUTE AGO. HOW IS IT WORKING NOW?\\n\r\nAnd the protagonist. He is a great charmer. He  preaches peace and harmony and has to rid the world of malevolence. Humans create malevolence and when it becomes in excess it turns to demons. He \"purifies\" the demons and is against killing them. But they don't tell how killing them is different than purifying them or what purifying really is. As in purifying he is also hitting them with his sword and basically slaughtering them. One of the characters asks him, what he means by purifying. And he's like idk. SERIOUSLY WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH THIS SHIT. HOW LAZY OF A WRITER CAN YOU BE TO WRITE THIS SHIT AND THEN EVEN MAKE AN ANIME ON IT WITH SUCH HIGH BUDGET. This is plainly ridiculous. And that it folks. That was my review on Tales of Zestiria the anime that shouldn't have been made",

It didn't even have an atmosphere, something that the equally poorly paced God Eater (also produced by ufotable) at least had. \r\nWhat pisses me off the most is that the rules of this world seem to be written by a six year old: \"So there's these ruins, and then there's this hero who can see spirits but only he can, and then there's this princess who really likes him. And then he goes off to kill dragons and stuff.\" There's not much behindthe motivations of the characters. None of them even have much character outside of the trope slots that they occupy. The most interesting thing about them is their appearance, for which there is no rhyme or reason. \\n\\n\r\nAll throughout, I was waiting for the plot to truly open up. I was bored out of my mind to the point of anger, and in the end I got nothing for my troubles.",

            "content": "(This is a spoiler-free review adapted for this site)\r\n[Synopsis]: Tales of Zestiria takes place in a world where long ago, humans and supernatural beings called seraphim lived alongside one another. Over the years, humanity lost the ability to perceive the seraphim and they grew scarce as the negative emotions of humanity, a corrupting force called \u2018malevolence,\u2019 took root in the land. Legends speak of ancient saviors called Shepherds who would bridge the gap between the two beings however none have appeared and the world grows darker by the day. The story begins when Alisha Diphda (Kayano Ai), princess of the Highland Empire, encounters a youngman named Sorey (Kimura Ryouhei) who is able to perceive the seraphim and who may be the world\u2019s only hope of purifying the world\u2019s proliferating malevolence.\\n\\n\r\n[Characters]: \\n\\n\r\nAs one might expect given the show\u2019s RPG roots, Tales of Zestiria centers around Sorey and his party of friends consisting of both seraphim and humans. The show has a moderately sized supporting cast but they are mostly there for the main group of characters to bounce off of and don\u2019t receive much in the way of characterization themselves. Even the majority of Sorey\u2019s companions are fairly one-dimensional, typically sporting a pretty clear-cut personality and not much else. Alisha at the very least represents a controversial, pacifistic ideology which both drives her actions as well as the narrative near the end of the show. The cast is lightly entertaining but there isn\u2019t much in the way of depth to speak of.\\n\\n\r\nSorey himself is about as bland as protagonists come. He\u2019s upbeat, kindhearted, and his idealistic aspirations of the seraphim and humanity once again coexisting alongside each other paint him as a self-sacrificing, good-guy. There is a genuine sense of comradery between him and his close friend Mikleo however beyond this bond his interactions with others are pretty generically amicable. There isn\u2019t anything that sets him apart from other characters and his painfully straightforward, good-nature just further homogenizes him.\\n\\n\r\nOutside of the cast\u2019s straightforward personalities and Sorey\u2019s own uninspired characterization, the thing that is most lacking in regards to the cast is good, character-exploring dialogue. Tales of Zestiria has plenty of scenes about world-building, politics, and the supernatural elements that populate its world however there\u2019s hardly any time where the characters take a moment to flesh each other out. This wouldn\u2019t be so dearly missed if the show didn\u2019t revolve around a tight, party of friends. Their exchanges are amicable and everyone gets along but the vast majority of their dialogue is just spent on the exposition of what it means to be a Shepard and continuously reiterating the importance of Sorey\u2019s quest.\\n\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: \\n\\n\r\nUndoubtedly, it is in Tale of Zestiria\u2019s visual presentation where it best succeeds. The visual effects are marvelous and possess a grand sense of scale that really accentuates the fantastic world the characters live in and the magic present in each of the show\u2019s story elements. The background settings are gorgeous though sometimes they don\u2019t blend as well as they could with the characters, leading to an awkward effect where they look slightly out of place in juxtaposition to the vast and colorful backdrop behind them. This is infrequent and very minor however.\\n\\n\r\nThe city the cast stays in for a time felt alive and bustling \u2013 shop owners stood outside their stalls and stores, people gathered and passed each other in the streets, and they really brought the setting to life. The show\u2019s action scenes were well-animated, fluid, and exciting. As a whole, Tales of Zestiria is a great-looking show. It\u2019s grandiose and vibrant presentation did well in executing the feel of a fantasy world and though the characters were lacking in appeal, it remained exceedingly pretty to watch. Whether or not these fantastic visuals and great production are enough to fully carry one\u2019s interest in the show will depend on the viewer.\\n\\n\r\n[Story]: \\n\\n\r\nWhile Tale of Zestiria\u2019s cast of characters aren\u2019t as compelling as they could have been, the most significant blow to the show\u2019s quality stems from its horrible pacing. The epilogue drops the viewer into a a dark and sinister fantasy world full of ancient ruins, political intrigue, and a sinister, looming mist on the horizon. It\u2019s very light on exposition and the characters go about their tasks as they normally would though the viewer isn\u2019t really clued into the implications of what is happening \u2013 what the mist means, why the kingdom is in the state that it is, who the characters are, etc. The first episode then delves a bit further into the mythology behind Tales of Zestiria mentioned in the epilogue and doesn\u2019t do much to explain the previous events though it introduces us to Sorey and Mikleo. With Sorey\u2019s introduction, a critical issue arises.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the very beginning, it is painfully obvious that Sorey will become the Shepard of legend. His good-nature, belief in the legends of the Shepard, ability to see the seraphim, and dream of humans and seraphim coexisting once again all point directly at this. With that knowledge in mind, the show then proceeds to take 4 entire episodes (or 5 if you count the prologue) to finally unveil him as such when he takes up the sacred blade. Tales of Zestiria drags its feet in the extreme after introducing its characters and takes far too long to magnificently affirm for the viewer what they already knew. Just as the show finally arrives at the starting point of Sorey\u2019s epic quest to cleanse the malevolence from the land and save the world, we are launched into a two-episode side-story.\\n\\n\r\nThe midsection of the show presents a brief, two-episode flashback concerning the characters and events of a different game in the Tales franchise \u2013 Tales of Berseria, which takes place many, many years before the events of the current show in the same world. Just like the epilogue, the viewer is tossed into an unfamiliar setting full of new monster types, magic powers, world rules, classifications, histories, and implications. It unapologetically immerses the viewer in this new, darker story and the show never bothers to connect it to the overarching show the viewer is familiar with which leads to it feeling pretty much purely promotional.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the worst part of this is that Velvet Crowe, the protagonist of this two-episode interlude, is far and away more interesting than Sorey. Her story as well as the setting is grim and dark compared to the cheery and colorful aesthetic of Tales of Zestiria. Between what characterization she receives and her dramatic quest for revenge, Velvet and the story of Berseria are far more enticing than the story at large and despite our complete inability to understand a lot of the terminology being bandied about, it\u2019s more immediately interesting than the show it interrupted. It has a sense of purpose and direction that up until that point, Zestiria wasn\u2019t able to deliver on.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, with the advent of episode 8 and the end of the flashback, Sorey and his companions at last embark on a journey. Even then the direction of the story is a bit vague in what Sorey is actually supposed to be doing and how he is going to cleanse the world of malevolence but at least they leave the capital city and start fighting monsters and dragons. So to reiterate, the key issue with Tales of Zestiria is that it takes 5 episodes to tell the viewer what they already knew, takes 2 episode off to explore a completely different story, and then features one final episode of bustling around before it can finally develop the sense of adventure that the premise of the show initially promises. While it has a second cour waiting in the wings, this is no excuse for how painfully drawn out Tales of Zestiria\u2019s storytelling is and how underdeveloped its characters are.\\n\\n\r\n[Sound]: \\n\\n\r\nWhile not distinctly memorable, the music is grand and adventurous like the show\u2019s visuals and is well situated to the narrative. It\u2019s hard to recall any part of the soundtrack individually but its a good deal of fun and supports Tale of Zestiria\u2019s visual presentation very well.\\n\\n\r\n[Final Thoughts and Rating]: \\n\\n\r\nTales of Zestiria is kind of a mixed bag in that, while it\u2019s characters are enjoyable, they are also very plain \u2013 especially in the case of Sorey. Though the world, aesthetic, and overarching plot of the show might be interesting, the narrative dawdles and needlessly draws out what should take a far shorter time to explore. It\u2019s gorgeous to look at, wonderfully animated, and exhibits some really exciting action scenes however it never fully steps beyond the realm of \u2018eye candy\u2019 in its attempt to drum up a compelling story.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 6\\n\\n\r\nI gave Tales of Zestiria a 6 primarily because of its fantastic visuals but also due to its moderately entertaining characters and narrative. While it doesn\u2019t present the most engaging of stories and it takes far too long to arrive at its adventurous core, the show was entertaining to watch. Hopefully the subsequent installment of the series can better flesh out what the first season found lacking and really begin to develop a stronger narrative overall.\\n\\n\r\n[Recommendations]: \\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019ve enjoyed other game adaptations and enjoy that kind of \u2018party-dynamic\u2019 that the main cast represents, you\u2019re likely to enjoy Tales of Zestieria. Anybody looking for a visually stunning, very straightforward action, adventure show won\u2019t be disappointed with the show\u2019s subject matter. Tales of Zestiria is pretty much what it promises to be and so anyone intrigued by its premise or genre will likely find what they go looking for.",

            "content": "After 12 long weeks, Tales of Zestiria the X finally came to an end, or rather unfortunately, because it was fantastic. Even before the start of the Summer 2016 season I knew that I could expect much of an Ufotable fantasy, action and adventure anime. I did not play the game so I won't be able to tell you which one was better, the game or the anime adaptation. But what I can do for sure is write my impressions and thoughts on the anime in this review. I know I am a week late with it but I hope you still enjoy!\r\nPLOT AND STORYLINE\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned in the intro, Tales of Zestiria the X (ToZX) is an action, adventure and fantasy anime made by one of my favorite production studios-ufotable. Even before the anime started airing in July, 2016 I knew I'd love it because I've been waiting for so long for an anime like this. I wanted a good, action rich, fantastic, magical anime with a lot of legend and prophecies and stuff like that and ToZX delivers all of that. In addition to that, ToZX has a thrilling, uncommon and catchy story you just don't wanna miss. \\n\r\nThe anime follows Sorey, a human boy that lived his whole life with seraphim, spiritual beings that are not visible to humans. He strongly believes in the folk tale that says \"long ago, every human was able to see the seraphim\" and so his greatest wish is to find out a way how to make humans and seraphim live together in peace again. In his first visit to the capital, Sorey gets involved in an accident during which he pulls out the legendary sword of Ladylake from a rock and becomes the Shepherd-one who casts away calamity from the world. Even tough that is the main plot there is one more important story line trough out the anime. It is the story of Alisha Diphda, the princess of the Highland empire. She also believes the Seraphim folk tale and so finds a lot trust and support from Sorey and it soon becomes clear that they follow one and the same dream. While Sorey sets of on a journey to learn what it really means to be a Shepherd, Alisha fights for peace and stability in her own empire. \\n\r\nThe first thing that made my watch and later on love the anime was definitely the story. I was always a fan of anime that based their story on ancient legends, prophecies and myths. The legends about the seraphim caught me right form the beginning. It's a pitty that they didn't continue more with the legends from the ancient ruins that Sorey explored together with his seraph friend Mikelio in the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nMoreover, ToZX delivers a lot of epic fights nad breathtaking action scenes. It is so magical and so amazing to see the seraphim Lailah, Mikelio and Edna fight calamity with Sorey. Besides, the powers of the three seraphim are based on the power of the four elements fire, water, earth and I think we'll meet an air seraphim in the second season. I've always loved this kind of magic and powers and I think every magic and fantasy fan will. The thing I found the most interesting in the anime is one more side-story that appears somewhere  in the middle of the anime with Crowe as the main character. It kinda came out of nowhere and with no connection to Sorey and Alisha at all. I am sure that they'll meet later in the anime and I actually just can't wait to see what will happen then. \\n\r\nNow if you ask whether Tales of Zestiria the X has a moral or a deeper meaning in the story, I'd say Yes, it does. The whole seraphim/human story is not the actual moral, but more the part with the calamity. War, fights, corruption and so on result in calamity or easier said: we create the demons that destroy our world and that's exactly what ToZX wants to show. The anime keeps you on tenterhooks the whole time and I personally just couldn't wait for next Sunday just to watch the new episode. Unfortunately, the first season of Tales of Zestiria the X came to an end last Sunday. Still, the anime was a huge success so I think it is not wrong to expect another season soon. *fingers crossed*\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nTruth is I loved Tales of Zestiria the X a lot, but it is still not a perfect 10/10. Unfortunately the characters lack in originality. Firstly you have Sorey who is the average main character. He is the hero of every situation and his actions are mainly predictable. Gladly, he is not the annoying type of main character because that could have ruined  the anime in many ways. Also the female protagonist of the story, Alisha is a common character you've seen in other anime too. She is a brave and independent character that always fights for justice. I've always loved strong and independent female characters but to be honest, they became boring over time. I loved Erza, Yona, Kallen, Akame etc. but now I am more a fan of arrogant villains such as Gilgamesh from Fate/ UBW. The only character that I though had more depth in her personality was Clowe. She is presented as the \"bad guy\" in the story but I think there is much more to it. Even tough we could see her in only 3 episodes (i think) I got the feeling that she is an extremely strong yet caring character with a thug past.  I hope we'll get to see more of her in the next season. \\n\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION AND STYLE\\n\\n\r\nWhat to say? I mean, it's an unfotable production. The production studio with the best animation of all. The animation of Tales of Zestiria the X is just fantastic, amazing, marvelous, magical, incredible, stunning, wonderful...I think you understand now how good it is. There is not a single flaw in the animation or the anime style. The style is also very unique and beautiful. The thing where you really get to see how good both, the animation and the style, are are the action scenes and the backgrounds. You just cannot believe how good it is. It is like a fantasy for your eyes. You cannot but enjoy it.  Lastly, I think I have the right to say that this is the best animation I have ever seen in my life. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude this review, Tales of Zestiria the X was a huge success. With a unique and intriguing story and an ufotable animation this anime could not but be amazing. And true the characters lack in originality but I think we can forgive the makers because they did everything else incredibly good. I haven't watched a lot anime form the Summer 2016 season but I am sure that Tales of Zestiria the X was among the better ones.",

            "content": "The artwork, animations and character designs were all very well done. The fighting scenes were also very good. But the story had some really strange pacing problems. The first few episodes felt very rushed. It felt strange because each episode  was jumping around from one giant battle to the next. It just felt like they didn't leave enough space for the characters to develop their relationships early on. They keep throwing more and more characters at you each episode. and this makes it very difficult to relate to many of the characters because they have these rushed introductions, and there are just so manycharacters but simply not enough time to make them develop all the characters. Even though the main plot for the story is a very generic chosen one story. It was still enjoyable to watch.",

The problem with Tales of Zestiria is that nothing is memorable, the animation is pretty decent...but, what about the story, the characters.  Where's the spirit?\r\nStory 3/10\r\nThe story is about a boy who lives in a magical world and he becomes the \"chosen one\" to defeat evil because...yeah, that's something totally original.  The story is so bad I don't even feel sympathetic with the creatures that live in this world.  The world is your typicalfantasy world: dragons, people sometimes use magic, almost everything in this world are woods and there are evil beings.  Nice.  I haven't played Tales of Zestiria, but Tales of the Abyss had a more interesting story.  I give it a 3/10 just because Tales of Berseria has a more promising story and it seems more like something I would love.  I hope we get more of Tales of Berseria on second season instead of Zestiria.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\\n\r\nYeah, it's beautiful.  It's colorful and great.  But with the awful character writing and awful situations, I would rather watch Fate/Zero again. Thanks ufotable though!\\n\\n\r\nSound 6.5/10\\n\\n\r\nSound is very good, but not really special.  It feels like an epic moment is going on when nothing special is happening.  I don't like the opening, the ending is meh.  I feel like ufotable is trying too hard with the sountrack.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 1/10\\n\\n\r\nGod, this is why I hate this show.  At least Re:Zero had some character development.  These characters are terrible.  Not even they fail to feel emotions, they fail to accomplish their stereotypes.  Genki boy Sorey is so boring, he is a good guy and wants to save everyone from evil...nice.  Mikleo is protagonist's best friend and he's always telling the protagonist how great is to explore ruins; he's also there to inform the protagonist the situation.  Pincess Alisha is a woman that I don't like just because she has no personality at all, she is just a princess. Then we have Lailah, who is there to inform the protagonist: \"that's an hellion, purify him\".  I forgot how the loli character was called, but she's terrible too.  And then we have 3 more characters that get almost no development at all.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThis show is boring.  Yeah, you get some nice animation, but that's all.  The only reason i will watch season 2 is because I would like to see some more Tales of Berseria, but if you want some eyecandy, go watch Fate/Zero.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall 5/10\\n\\n\r\nTales of Zestiria the X is a skippable anime.  I wouldn't recomment it to anyone, and I mean, I would rather watch something that doesn't bore me than this \"good vs evil in a fantasy world\" show.",

            "content": "After watching just the first few minutes of this show, I can safely say that Ufotable has once again proven that they are worthy of handling CG. Beyond the visuals, Tales of Zestiria the X is more than just another Unlimited visual porn. \r\nThe series is based on the video game of the franchise although it has its own set of principles. Early impressions of the show establishes a set-up as we meet the main protagonists \u2013 Alisha, Sorey, and Mikelo. From the setting, there are many conflicts, mostly those that revolve around the supernatural and unnatural phenomenons. In addition, the story indulges with itsfantasy setting and deep history. Of course, there\u2019s world building that has its importance. The show seems to hit the right spots from the beginning and able to stretch its story all the way through. Even early exposition doesn\u2019t bring the series down as we learn just why the world of Zestiria is so interesting.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the characters are somewhat generic, they do each have their own unique traits. For instance, Sorey is brave that puts others\u2019 well-being above his own. He isn\u2019t afraid to take risks either and we often see him go beyond lengths to get the job done. In nature, he is a classic adventurer, the type that is curious about the wonders of the world. His easygoing personality makes him easy to find new friends and thus, we see that he earns a lot of allies. Meanwhile, there\u2019s Alisha. She\u2019s a princess and knight who loves her kingdom and people. However, she does have some personal demons and is afraid of being unable to carry her responsibilities at times. Similarly to Sorey, she is courageous and isn\u2019t afraid to take risks either whether it\u2019s to put her own life at risk or getting involved in situations that puts her in disadvantageous positions. Finally, we got Mikelo, Sorey\u2019s best friend and sometimes rival. Unlike Sorey, he is very calm and often quite analytical for just about anything. This actually sets up for a duo that can compliments on each others\u2019 strengths and weaknesses. They are not just the only characters though as we meet others in the series that joins on their quest such as Liliah, Edna, and Rose. Their role in the series varies although all offer something to bring to remember by. Sorey\u2019s relationship with them is also important to note as he develops trust with Alisha while his friendship with Mikelo, Lilah, and Edna show us more of his true character. \\n\\n\r\nOne other important thing to note is that the show promotes another game from the Tales universe, Tales of Berseria. As such, expect to see main female protagonist Velvet from that game to make her presence. It share the same world as Zestiria and takes place in the Holy Midgand Empire. What\u2019s interesting about Velvet is that she is very different from the main characters form Zestiria. This is because of her role as an avenger after the tragic past she suffered at the hands of a man named Artorius. While the series doesn\u2019t conclude her main story, it does well establish Velvet\u2019s characteristics as a cold woman, a contrast to Sorey or Alisha. And even though the purpose of those episodes are just to promote the game, it really makes us wonder more about her story. I have not played the game before but Velvet definitely brings something unique to the show overall. Her stance as a vengeful warrior seeking revenge may be generic on paper but also shows just how tragedy can change a person in their world.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of world, Tales of Zestiria offers plenty of time for building more into its fantasy themes. From malevolence to devious Hellions, it has the feel of a high fantasy adventure. The kingdoms and towns themselves also have history as well so viewers won\u2019t be left stranded about being confused. There\u2019s also terms that are important to understand such as Shepherd and Seraphim. These are important as Sorey\u2019s role as a Shepherd can make great changes in their world. One other thing I want to point out is that the show isn\u2019t afraid to take risks as it sometimes bounces between calm and fast paced episodes. The pacing in general is crafted well although some plot elements are rather predictable in particular with the revelation of Rose\u2019s identity or some conclusions to the various battles.\\n\\n\r\nAnimated by Ufotable, a powerhouse studio well known for their high quality. This show does not disappoint at all when it comes to visuals. In fact, if there\u2019s anything to talk about, it would the high level production. It\u2019s basically 3D done right whether it\u2019s the character designs, the monsters (Hellions), or intense battle segments. In addition, the choreography of the character movements complements well in almost every scene with little still shot scenes. Camera angles are timed properly and there\u2019s minimal fan service. Well, you do get service in the full action packed in-your-face kind of way.\\n\\n\r\nEven the soundtrack of the series is admirable. The OP and ED theme songs are dosed with instrumental beats that will get the adrenaline pumping.  There\u2019s character voice mannerism that works quite well to fit their personalities. I have to admit that even the OST has impact on the show to add emotional value. \\n\\n\r\nTales of Zestiria the X is the kind of series that can entertain far more than just what it seems to be. It puts on a memorable world with its cast of characters on their adventures. While the story itself may or may not suit everyone\u2019s tastes, it\u2019s still quite special for a fantasy series. The show also offers a sneak peek to the world of Berseria so fans can get a taste of the game. With that being said, the series almost feels like a movie each episode. As a way to chronicle their adventures further, even a second season was announced before the finale. It\u2019s a good time to be a Tales fan.\\n",

            "content": "Tales of Zestiria the X was an anime that I, well not only me but most had been waiting for a very long time. Knowing that it was an anime from the studio Ufotable, that is known to have flawless and picturesque CG, I was very exited and thrilled about how they were going to execute the series. I haven't played the game of it, nor seen the play-through of it. Therefore it was an entirely new series for me. \r\nThe art/animation was perfect, the battle animation, the landscapes, very realistic to almost mesmerizing detail... that I had to hand down to them, it wastruly majestic to look at and the story line was simple and quite interesting.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, when its first 3 to 4 episodes got aired, honestly I was very let down by it. The story itself at the beginning was a very slow paced one which was a little bother as i had to wait one whole week for an episode, on top of it they switched the plot in the middle of the story, to Tales of Berseria at which made me really confused and took my interest out of the it at times. \\n\r\nNevertheless, Tales of Berseria was rather much enjoyable than i thought it would be, although short.  \\n\r\nMore over anything, the main aspect to what really put me off were the characters, I knowingly found the characters in Tales of Zestiria a little too what you call shallow or geeky in comparison to its counterpart to Berseria. where the flow of the characters interactions from Zestiria seemed almost forced, I was pretty annoyed by it.\\n\\n\r\nDespite everything, as the story continued past they kept on introducing new characters one after another at a great pace and that seemingly slow start started to cover up. With little to no detail to how it was all going to mix up. Slowly but surely the story finally started to dig in to as it went on, somehow I surprisingly got costumed to the shallowness of the characters, well only a little... and as the story came to its last 2 to 3 episodes my opinion about it changed and found it pretty good in-spite of its slow start. The story finally started coming to place as it came to its end.\\n\r\nOverall knowing this season was/is maybe an introduction to its sequels, i must say it was a pretty worth the time as long as they don't mess up the sequels.\\n\\n\r\nNow hoping to get the story plot to set to its main stage in the next season. What i am most excited to know is to find out what role the Tales of Berseria plays in the future.\\n\\n\r\n------------------------------------\\n\r\nOverall: 7.5\\n\r\n------------------------------------\\n\r\n-Story: 7\\n\r\n-Art: 10\\n\r\n-Sound: 8\\n\r\n-Enjoyment: 7\\n\r\n-Characters: 6\\n\\n\r\n------------------------------------\\n\\n\\n\r\n**This is my first review**",

            "content": "Have you ever had a hotdog? Its a quick and easy to prepare meal that can be enjoyed by anyone. Most people that eat a hot dog need something filling that does not take a lot of time out of their day, as they have other things to do than savor food. \r\nWell imagine if everyday as a natural routine, you bought a hot dog from a vendor. Then one day, when you bought that hot dog, you met a world class chef who offered to make a world class meal for the price of a hot dog. However, out of habit you instinctively say\"hot dog\". So the chef prepares you a world class hot dog. When you eat it, it tastes much better than any of the other   hot dogs you've ever had, but its still tastes like fast food. You've had better tasting meals from lower quality chefs, and you wonder if you wasted an opportunity. Well, in this case, Ufotable is the world class chef, Tales of Zestiria the game is the hot dog, and its anime counterpart is that wasted opportunity\\n\\n\r\nPlot: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nIt's funny, out of all the video game franchises, the Tales series seems like it is the easiest to adapt into an anime. It has character dynamics, dramatic scenes, scenes of intense suspense, and large plot lines that come together at the right moment. Except, none of these are Tales of Zestiria's strong points. The developers were much more concerned with creating unique bonus bosses and developing a customization system using items, to really care about the plot. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot itself can be summed up like this \"A member of the royal family searches for a hero that can save the land which is being swallowed by the darkness of an evil overlord. The hero leaves his isolated village and draws a magic sword to gain the powers to defeat the darkness. He visits a number of elemental temples, becomes stronger and with this power he defeats the evil overlord and saves the world\". That's pretty much it. The plot line is so generic they might as well have renamed the game \"Tales of Zelda\". There is exactly one plot twist, and it serves to pad out the game by another twenty hours before being resolved due to the final party member having just the right Macguffin to resolve the plot. How convenient!\\n\\n\r\nBecause its an adaptation, Tales of Zestiria the X, is stuck with with this stupid plot, though it deserves a 6 for at least trying. It cuts out some of the dumber elements of the game, like the scene where Sorey and Mikleo casually stand and watch as a hellion eats Mason, or when the townsmen panic when their beloved Shepherd uses his powers to help them, or when the group so brilliantly leaves the plotters of a coup attempt in power before sending the princess back to them. It's a credit to the writers that they made this bad plot watchable, if not unique or enthralling.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you are watching the anime for any reason, its this. The anime uses its material's liberal use of magic to create some absolutely breathtaking displays of art. Monsters, such as dragons are beyond comparison to their looks in other studios. The fight scenes are incredibly dynamic, from the fluid movements to the dynamic camera angles, when action actually happens all complaints about the plot disappear until after it is over.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\\n\r\nTales of Zestiria the X contains a number of different soundtracks, many of which are remixes of tracks in the game. However, they all seem to fit the mood well.  The music encapsulates all manner of emotion but the best tracks of all are the bombastic ones that occur when the group is in danger. They really make action scenes feel intense. My only complaint is their aren't enough lighthearted tracks, as the pause in music when things are calm seem kind of awkward.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nIts hard to completely judge this, since character is really dependent on a full viewing of the plot in order to gauge it properly but judging by what I've seen, its not impressive. Much of character development has a very shonen feel. If I had a dollar for every time a character said \"I want to get stronger\" I would buy Ufotable and make them animate better material. Two of the characters are very naive and there doesn't seem to be a story line that focuses on these characteristics. What's worse is that Ufotable removed the one redeeming quality about the characters in the game. In the game, the characters are at least funny. Here, they replaced it with angst, which seems like better fuel for character development but they don't do anything with it.  The anime spends 9 episodes with characters that all have the same ideals, creating a sort of echo chamber that is begging for conflict. It seems to be getting out of this rut with the introduction of Zavied and Edna, but less patient viewers might lose interest with the shows lack of humor or conflict before this point. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nTales of Zestiria the X is kind of a mixed bag for me. After playing the game, I was ready to hate the anime. However, it isn't bad by any means. Its just not spectacular. If you want to gaze at wonderful art designs and great action scenes, Tales of Zestiria the X has enough to make you come back for more, while its characters and plot are tolerable enough to watch the context without being bored.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:7/10\\n\\n\r\nTales of Zestiria the X is a good show made by a spectacular studio. This comparison leads to an obvious dip in quality that may trick viewers into thinking the show is bad. However, Tales of Zestiria's production value should not be underestimated, as this show is truly breathtaking. I only hope next time Ufotable actually checks what they are adapting next time, so they don't make the same mistake of attempting to spin something bad into something that's great and getting something that's a bit above average as a result of their hard work. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I learned two things while I was watching Tales of Zestiria the X. \r\n1: Ufotable is one of the few studios in the world who can adapt a video game properly and with extreme care\r\n2: Their visuals and animation never ceases to amaze me. \r\n[Story]: (6/10)\r\nTales of Zestiria doesn't really have the best story out there. It's nothing innovative, it's nothing new and it's been done before. I played the game and I wasn't really impressed with the game's story and it's the same case here. It wasn't shit or anything. The story was just decent, at best. It's just a story of \"Good vsEvil\" and the evil masterlord (Lord of Calamity) is going to eradicate the world and a certain someone becomes the hero that everyone needs (The Sheppard) and he will save the world from evil and darkness. There's also the \"two races that can't live side by side\" and all that other crap. I basically just summarize the whole story for you. \\n\\n\r\nThe story may not be that impressive (It wasn't shit either) but I was really impressed with the show's eyegasmic visuals and animation. The action scenes was really smooth and very appealing to watch. Whoever's the Animation Director clearly knew when to place the shots to make the fighting scenes a lot more amazing than your usual regular anime fights. Also, the action scenes' Animation Style felt really similar to another one of ufotable's works \"Unlimited Blade Works\". It's not like I'm complaining or anything since I love UBW's action scenes and I don't really care if they use their style in Tales of Zestiria. \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it\" is what I'd like to say about UBW's and Zestiria's similar Animation style. The rest of my impressions towards Zestiria's animation will be on the \"Art/Animation\" section. \\n\\n\r\nThe show moves at an extremely slow paced so I'd understand if some people ended up dropping Zestiria because the first couple of episodes can get really boring and some parts later on in the show can also get boring. Do I consider this one of the show's flaws? Ehh, not really. Due to the show's slow pacing, I was able to understand all of the information that they were throwing at me and it was easier for me to get connected with the characters and their purpose/motivations. I also prefer slow pacing so that's one of the reasons why I didn't get bored at the show. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing that I found really annoying in Zestiria is how they decided to abruptly stop Zestiria's story just to put in a Tales of Berseria advert-- I mean.. a \"special flashback\". I admit that based on the two episodes that was focused on Berseria and its characters, it was a helluva lot more interesting than what we have right now in Zestiria. The MC in Berseria \"Velvet\" is, in my opinion, a lot better than Sorey. Sorey is just an adventurous type of person and Velvet's motivation for revenge is more exciting to watch. They could have made this into an OVA but what's done is done, I suppose. \\n\\n\r\nSeeing as how there's a Berseria advertisement in-between Zestiria, it looks like Bandai Namco funded this series solely just to advertise Berseria. Then again, why would ufotable go through all these trouble just to try and  change the original game's storyline into something good. Hell, they even gave Alisha a lot more character in the anime compared to the game plus the anime is getting a 2nd Season. So I think this adaptation is a little bit of both. Advertising and they (most likely) wanted to do Zestiria justice in terms of its story and characters because the game suffered from both aspects, more so in the characters department *ahem Alisha in the game sucks major ass ahem*.  \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: (10/10)\\n\r\nAfter watching Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works, I thought ufotable has reached their peak in terms of what they can do with the Animation. I thought that they already reached the ceiling since improving the Animation even further might turn their future series from 2D Animation to 3D Animation. I guess I was wrong. As of this writing, Tales of Zestiria the X has better Animation than any anime I've seen that was released in the past 5 or more years. Everything from their outstanding visuals, impressive character designs, very smooth action scenes and their almost-perfect utilization of CGI into 2D Animation. Just watching Episode 0 alone, I thought I was watching a fucking anime movie. That's how perfect Zestiria's Animation was.  \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Sound]: (9.5/10)\\n\r\nI am SO GLAD that ufotable decided to keep the game's OST in the anime adaptation. The game's OST was beautiful (right up there with Final Fantasy's OST, if I say so myself) and hearing the OST in the anime version (Sorey's theme, anyone?) made me glad that they kept it in the adaptation. It felt like I was playing the game all over again except this time, I wasn't controlling Sorey or any of my party members and I don't have to go through those boring-ass dungeons. Man, I can't wait till the 2nd Season reaches to \"that\" point where the \"Rising Up\" song plays. It's going to be fucking hype if they actually use that song in the 2nd Season but that's all I'm going to say. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP theme song is \"Kaze no Uta\" by FLOW. I'm going to piss off a lot of fans here (probably) but I love the anime's OP way more than the game's OP. Don't get me wrong, I also like \"White Light\" but Kaze no Uta is just a whole lot better for me. The chorus, the buildup to the chorus, the first few sec. of the OP that sounds like some hymn from a church, and FLOW is why I love this song and this is also in my Top 3 Anime OP this year. \\n\r\nThe ED theme song is \"calling\" by fhana. I actually heard fhana's performance first in HaruChika's OP and that song sounded really good so I couldn't wait to hear her performance here in Zestiria. Once again, she delivered. I really love her high notes and her beautiful voice. \\n\\n\r\nI played the game in English so it would make perfect sense for me to watch the show in English Dub so I did. I'm honestly surprised that FUNimation managed to get all the cast from the game back since most of the VA's don't even live in Texas and while Funi said that the original VA for Mikleo didn't return, I'm willing to bet my life that he did because his voice in the anime sounds EXACTLY like him. I'm pretty sure the original VA for Mikleo used a pseudonym because he's part of the union. Finally, as expected from FUNi's dubs, their voice acting was really good. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Characters]: (7/10)\\n\r\n[Skip the first paragraph if you don't want to read my rant about Alisha's role in the game]\\n\r\nI really appreciate what ufotable is doing to Alisha in this anime adaptation. In the game, she's supposed to be the main heroine of the series. In the trailers and even the advertisements, they portrayed her as the main heroine. You know, as someone who's going to be important in the Zestiria storyline. Then I played the game.....Yea....I was disappointed with what they did to Alisha. Appearantly, whoever's the director of the game had some fucking gripe with Alisha that he didn't bother giving Alisha that much development in the 1st half of the game and later on, she left and never came back. They even released an \"Alisha DLC\" as a sort of apology to the fans but I was even more disappointed with the DLC. The only saving grace of that DLC was me being able to control Alisha but every part of that DLC sucks. (Don't even get me started on that long, tedious boring-ass dungeon that took me over an hour to get through)\\n\\n\r\nSo going back to my point, I'm glad that ufotable did Alisha, in this adaptation, justice. She got a helluva lot more screentime and character development in the anime compared to the game. Hell, Episode 0 (which was anime original) tells me that ufotable is doing everything they can to show the viewers (and the fans of the game) that she's the main heroine of Zestiria. Not Rose and not Mikleo (Don't even ask me \"Isn't Mikleo a guy?\" because that's the joke). Alisha in the game came off as \"that character\" who I didn't give a shit about and Alisha in the anime version came off as an independent badass princess who'll do anything to achieve her ideals and I actually cared more about Alisha while I was watching Zestiria than playing Zestiria. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the protagonist of the series. Sorey, as the MC, is not that impressive. Sorey is just a pure-hearted person who is an adventurous type of person but after learning about the relationship between Humans and Seraphims and after he became the Sheppard, he vowed to saved the world from the Lord of Calamity and to also restore the relationship between both races. Like I haven't seen his type before. Velvet, the MC of Tales of Berseria, is already better than Sorey just by watching the two episode special. Her goals and motivations are more intriguing than Sorey. Moving on, Sorey got a decent amount of character development in this season but he'll get more focus in the 2nd Season but he doesn't get any better. \\n\\n\r\nFor the rest of the characters, you know how when you play an RPG, your party expands the more you play the game? It's the same case here. Throughout the series, they each join Sorey's party because they have the same goals and ideals or Sorey offers to help solve their problem. They don't really get that much character development though. The only reason why I like them are their personalities.  \\n\\n\r\nOne minor aspect that I didn't like was how ufotable removed and/or skipped most of the funny side of the characters. Yes, I know that they made up for it by showing the characters' funny side in the post-credit \"Skit\" scene but to me, that wasn't really enough. For example, Edna wasn't being \"Edna: best girl\" (In the game, she was fucking hilarious) after she got introduced. However, in the post-credit scene, that's when Edna (sort-of) truly shines and shows off why she's the best girl.\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]: (8/10)\\n\r\nDespite the decent-but-not-so-impressive storyline, I still enjoyed Zestiria because of its breathtaking and visually appealing animation. Watching the show just for its characters and the animation was enough for me. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[VERDICT]\\n\r\nI'm amazed at how how ufotable handled the adaptation. They managed to adapt a video game-series that I didn't like that much, in terms of its story and some characters, and turned it into a good video game adaptation. They also handled Alisha better than how the game handled her and honestly, I can finally say that Alisha is better than Rose. Edna is still the best girl though :P. The anime also gave off that \"I'm playing an RPG\" vibe and it's very rare for a video game adaptation to give off that vibe for me. Now the wait for the 2nd Season begins \\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]: (8.2/10)\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+A very rare, good video game adaptation\\n\r\n+Alisha is handled better in the anime version than the game\\n\r\n+Re-use of awesome soundtracks from the game\\n\r\n+Outstanding and Visually Appealing Animation\\n\r\n+Impressive utilization of CGI into 2D Animation\\n\r\n+Action scenes gives off multiple but pleasant \"Eyegasms\" \\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Not-so-impressive storyline\\n\r\n-Sorey, as the MC, is meh\\n\r\n-Not a lot of character development for most of the main characters.",

It's obvious that everything that they made looks beatiful, the only reason i don't give it a 10 it's because Fate which came before, looks a bit better.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nI'm not a professional on this aspect, but i think it's fine. But a problem i noticed is that sometimes the show decides to use music from the game, and feels a bit out of place sometimes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10\\n\r\nThe problem with the characters, is that they're extremely plain, Sorey is the tipical goodie two shoes that wants to save the world, Mikleo is your tipical tsundere who can't be 2 feet separated from Sorey, Alisha i just simply hate her because how boring she is, and the rest of the characters don't get enough screen time or develop to really care about them. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nAs a fan of the series, i enjoyed the series. But if you're not a fan or don't like slow pased shows, just avoid this show, because it's not for you.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\r\nIt's better than the game, at least.",

            "content": "Note: I watched the show first, played the game, and then rewatched some episodes afterwards. Therefore, most of my commentary is going to be based on how well the adaptation conveyed information with respect to in-game elements (skits, townsmen info, etc.).\r\nThe biggest concern I had with this show is with the pacing, since I didn't know how much of the game this first season would cover and with 2/12 episodes dedicated to Tales of Berseria. S1 barely covers the first few hours of the game; Sorey does not have his \"full party\" yet, and has only learned of the main antagonist towards the ending. I'mnot sure how many more seasons Zestiria the X will have, but they did completely change some game events (not only for the reduction of battle or exploration game time) and mixed in information learned later in game with some semi-angsty/dramatic flashbacks upon the arrival of a new character. Hopefully that will help convert some dense game time into a few 20-minute episodes, but even prior to playing to the game, everything from information to changes of scenery seemed a little rushed.\\n\\n\r\nDespite of this fast pacing, the anime managed to flesh out the characters in a way that the game hasn't. One big example is Alisha, the Knight-Princess who has two countries worth of problems and then some. At the ending of S1 she barely joins the party, but in game Sorey and company have on and off encounters with her prior to that, which doesn't give much game or screen time for the viewer/player to get a feel of her character past being an honest person with a sense of duty. The anime made her much more proactive by showing scenes from her point of view, something the game can't achieve as well since it's mostly Sorey's POV, limited to the player's choice of interaction, and most character-building is through skits and a few cutscenes.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, overall character personalities have taken a bit of a hit from the fast pacing because they come off as more serious. Yes the situations they deal with aren't very pleasant to begin with, but since very little to none of the side skits aren't integrated into the anime-- so far, at least-- all the camaraderie seen in game (of almost everyone ragging on everyone else in the group, consciously or not) hasn't been conveyed as well. At most Sorey's and Mikleo's friendship was given the most screentime to develop and conveyed their deep childhood friendship, but even then it went from the game's overly-protective-and-teasing-friendship to melodramatic scenes and cradle-holding. However, like I said, S1 only covers so little of the first few hours of the game, so maybe S2 will change that.\\n\\n\r\n--\\n\\n\r\nStory/Character: 7~7.5/10\\n\r\nCliche hero with a heart pure of gold who's an archaeology geek/history buff. Personally I like pure-hearted protags, and Sorey earns more points because I like dead things too. Also, it's not said within this season, but that pure heart of his plays a large factor in later events. The episode explaining what it really means to purify humans-turned-hyouma as a Shepherd is a bit of a preview of many struggles to come. As previously mentioned, also like how the anime adds a bit of depth to characters in comparison to how the game handled them, but it might not be as great for viewers who have only or who are only planning on watching the anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nEverything is gorgeous. Everyone is gorgeous. Even the CGI monsters were pretty great. 11/10 for you, Ufotable.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nIt's pretty good, I guess. Like the utilization of various zone/battle music from the game in the scenes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nMostly suffered from pacing. I also didn't like how 2 Berseria episodes were stuck in the middle of the season, no matter how good their story is. That would've stuck out like a sore thumb especially if I had been watching Zestiria the X on a weekly basis.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.5~8/10\\n\r\nThis show is basically a huge advertisement for the Zestiria and Berseria games. It did pretty damn well with that goal in mind.",

            "content": "First of all although i have played the game that serves as the source material for the anime i haven't completed it. Additionally the anime expands a lot of what was only shown and mentioned in the game and diverges a lot from it so at this point whether or not i finished it is a bit mute. \r\nThe main story of Tales of Zestiria revolves around the story of the Shepard and more precisely the story of the newest Shepard who in this is the main character Sorey.  The Shepard is supposed to a powerful figure that has the power to interact witha spirit race called the seraphim and in conjunction protect the world by ridding it of malevolence and defeat the one responsible for causing them which is the lord of calamity. \\n\\n\r\nThe story follows the journey of Sorey as he explores the land and meeting the lands many people while at the same time cleansing them of Malevolence. At the same time Sorey and co find themselves tied to the fate of the kingdom that they currently travel in. \\n\\n\r\nSorey is the main character of the series and though in the beginning he was a rather plain character that was always willing to explore new areas this changed when he become the Shepard. In the beginning Sorey was honest, kind and loved to explore the old ruins that were located near his home. As the only human within the seraphim settlement that he lived in he was able to see the normally invisible race and establish a kinship with them. Sorey had since he was little looked up to and respected the race thanks to a ancient book that he had read and continues to read and believes that despite past events the seraphims and humanity would once again work together once more like they did in the past. \\n\\n\r\nOnce Sorey becomes the Shepard his personality underwents some changes. Although still positive and kind Sorey becomes determined to end the malevolence that plagues the land to protect the weak and the helpless from it. Although Sorey still has a lot to learn about being a Shepard he tries to learn all he can and think though things before committing to an action. \\n\\n\r\nSorey can be stubborn at times but often this to to help a friend or people that need help. One aspect that i like about Sorey is his restraint in that he understands that killing would create more malevolence and in turn create more hatred meaning that no matter how much someone deserves it Sorey shouldn't kill him. In the anime there were instances where Sorey could have ended these people there but instead held back and only purified them something that i respect him for. \\n\\n\r\nMikleo is Soreys best friend and is a seraphim from the village that Sorey grew up in. Unlike Sorey Mikleo is calm and collected and not given to rash action. He's usually the voice of caution within the party. In the beginning Mikleo was the sole spirit user in the group and advised Sorey on everything and was especially wary of humans due to limited contact with them. He was also wary of the role of a Shepard and did not wish for Sorey to become one. \\n\\n\r\nHowever this misgiving changed when he saw how Sorey excelled at being one. In the beginning Mikleo's spirit power was relatively weak and therefore could only provide limited support to Sorey. This was a fact that bothered him a lot that he managed to solve by finding an ancient artifact that was suggested by Lailah that boosted his powers a lot. Mikleo's interactions with Edna a fellow seraph was pretty funny though. \\n\\n\r\nAlisha is one of the main characters of the show and is the princess of the kingdom of Hyland. Alisha is kind, caring, intelligent and detests war and the suffering that it brings. She is loyal to her country and strives to protect its people. As a member of the royal family Alisha often find's herself having to\\n\r\ndeal with the countries politicians in the ruling of the country especially among the warmongers. Because she detests war she does not advocate starting wars or fighting them. Alisha can be stubborn at times especially \\n\r\nwhen she tries to help people a trait that i admire about her.\\n\\n\r\nDespite being a princess Alisha is also a fully trained knight and is a capable combatant with her spear able to fight members of the assassin guild that was hired to kill her on even terms. \\n\\n\r\nAlisha believes wholeheartedly in the existence of the seraphs and their eventual return to help Humanity in their hour of need. As such Alisha has a good relationship with Sorey and believes in him and respects his\\n\r\nopinions greatly. \\n\\n\r\nAlisha is portrayed by veteran seiyuu Ai Kayano who is one of my top ten fav seiyuu's of all time. Her performance here was just as amazing as always.\\n\\n\\n\r\nLailah is a fire spirit and a seraph that acted as the guardian for the sword that people must pull out if they wished to become a Shepard. Wise, kind and beautiful Lailah despite being centuries old still looks to be someone in early adulthood. Within the story Lailah acts as one of Sorey's main advisers \\n\r\nand teaches him on the duties of a Shepard and whats involved. Despite this she is patient with this and teaches Sorey slowly so as to not overload him with info. \\n\\n\r\nWhen Lailah doesn't want to talk about something she \\n\r\nabruptly changes topic while smiling something that i find quite funny. \\n\r\nAs a fire spirit she attacks with pages from a book that she wields that incorporates flames in their attacks.\\n\\n\r\nWithin the anime Lailah was voiced by veteran seiyuu Noriko Shitaya who replaced the seiyuu that played her in the game Miyu Matsuki who sadly passed away before the anime started. Within the anime Lailah along with Alisha is one of my fav characters largely due to their respective seiyuu's. Here Noriko Shitaya of Fate stay night fame did a fantastic job portraying Lailah whether being the witty and calm Lailah outside of battle or the serious and wise one during battle she truly excelled. \\n\\n\r\nEdna is a seraph and is aligned with the power of Earth. Appearance wise Edna is pretty and petite on the outside but in the inside she detests humans. However this changes somewhat after she meets Sorey because he was different. \\n\\n\r\nPersonality wise Edna can be cold and merciless at times but to friends and people that she respects she can be warm to them. Her character has some interesting interactions with Mikleo. Although Edna was skeptical of Sorey \\n\r\nlike a lot of people she does eventually warm up to him after seeing his determination and courage.\\n\\n\r\nRose is a main character and a human being. Appearance wise Rose is a teenage girl of average height and short red hair and appears to be a merchant or at least part of a company that does that. However this is not actually the case. Rose is a interesting character in that she actually has two persona's that she presents depending on her role. In normal form she is polite,devious and sneaky at times. In  her alternate form she is serious, logical and lethal with her weapons. In this season Rose wasn't given much of a large role and as such its difficult to judge her character.\\n\\n\r\nZaveid and Dezel are two seraph's that Sorey and co meet during the course of the anime. Zaveid and Dezel are both wind users though they have different personalities. Zaveid's personality is more like a trickster as he isn't loyal to anyone compared to the other seraphs. Within the anime\\n\r\nSorey and co meet Zaveid at the same time that they meet Edna as both were engaged with a dragon that they both knew. And both had reasons to face it. In this season neither was give much of role and its difficult to see and judge their characters with regards to the story. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation as expected of Ufotable the makers of the fate stay night series  is top notch and clear with the fight scenes being the most impressive. Art style was pretty good overall and i felt that the character \\n\r\ndesigns were well designed and were largely faithful to the source material. \\n\\n\r\nMusic was generally good across the anime with scene to scene music being appropriate. Opening and ending themes i felt were especially good. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Tales of Zestiria was a great anime that had top notch animation, great story, interesting characters and stellar voice acting from a talented cast. I was overjoyed to hear that there will be a season 2 to this anime. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Tales of Zestiria the X ... When I found out they're making an anime based on the game I really liked , naturally I got pretty excited although I wasn't expecting anything phenomenal but the anime was better than what I expected . Of course it doesn't live up to the game but it is pretty good by itself . Let's talk about the anime , the story covers almost half of the game which is expected since they confirmed second season's production . It's consisted of 3 episodes about the upcoming Tales of Berseria and other 9 episodes are based on the Tales OfZestiria . The story narration is far from perfect as it skips through most stuff happened in the game but is pretty good if you consider it's based on a game :/ . The fighting scenes are made with a lot of consideration and contain lots of drama but the relation between characters isn't how it should be and it's because of the 9 episodes they had which isn't much to work on . The characters themselves are pretty good but again they don't have much time to work on the relation in between and some scenes feel a bit awkward esp. introducing Edna which was so hasty that you don't get any feelings toward her . There is the sound which is really good not only the opening and ending but the background music and sound esp. in fighting scenes are praiseworthy . Then there is the art and it is absolutely STUNNING . It is by far the best one I've seen , every detail is considered in the art and it feels really perfect the colorings esp. are really good . The show is quite enjoyable contrary to what I expected and is worth your time :)",

            "content": "Ufotable.  The name of the production company has an army of fans in its wake from the kind of quality that their adaptations have been able to produce.  From story to soundtrack to the oh so god-like animation with a seemingly unlimited budget for just how well produced is looks, very little can be said about Ufo that hasn't already been said before.  And so, we come to their newest project, Tales of Zestiria the X, a game adaptation from one of the \"Tales of\" games about a boy's journey to purge the world of malevolence.\r\nStory: The world of Zestiria is plaguedby great malevolence created from the negative and depressing emotions that come from all sources such as nature and people that taints the world and things that live in them to become hellions, demonized versions of the various beings'.  It is here where we in this world populated by people and mythical beings known as Seraphim that we follow Sorey, the Shepherd better known as the one who will purge the world from the malevolence.\\n\\n\r\nZestiria's story...isn't all that exciting admittedly.  With only 12 episodes to try and tell the story or at least part of the story of a game that's ~100 hours (because lol, JRPGs) the actual content in the show doesn't really go that far into the series.  Very few things of significance actually happen over the course of the story, and the majority of the runtime involves a lot of talking and lore/world building as Sorey adapts to his new role as the 'Shepherd'.  As a result of that, Zestiria severely lacks a story that progresses at an even pace since the whole span of the series is pretty much a slow but detailed crawl to the planned stopping point.  \\n\\n\r\nIn addition to that, the middle of the series takes a really strange turn that apparently has a reason for doing it, but I think it would've been better to not do it in the first place.  Anyway, the strange turn comes in the form of two of the middle two episodes in the series where the show switches GAMES and spends some time on another Tales of game, Tales of Berseria.  As to why they did this, I have no idea, but personally, I would've preferred if they didn't do it in the first place and spent that runtime doing something with the main story rather than using it for something that to someone that doesn't know much about the series, doesn't really make all that sense.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the story of Zestiria is pretty basic.  Sure you have some good lore elements and world-building that many fantasy shows can only dream of, but the trade-off to that is the fact that the series doesn't really go far enough to have anything significant happen.  The journey of Sorey and his Seraphim companions is just barely past the starting line by the time we finish the last episode, which does hamper the series because it really doesn't feel like we got anywhere aside from the expositional chapter.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Interesting world building and lore\\n\r\n-  Weird Berseria insert that felt out of place\\n\r\n-  Pretty basic story and premise all around\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:  The characters that we're introduced to in Zestiria vary pretty wildly from being almost non-existent to being part of the main cast without really much to say about them.\\n\\n\r\nFirst we have Sorey, the new Shepherd and main protagonist of the series.  Sorey's vision and overall character revolves around the ideal of bringing Seraphim and humans together.  As your stereotypical, noble hero who wishes nothing but good in the world, Sorey is a pretty innocent and all-around generic hero character.  Sure he gets development later in the series when he finally sees what his duties as a Shepherd are, but it's not so heavily put that it severely alters his character in any way.\\n\\n\r\nThen there're the Seraphim companions that Sorey meets along his journey, starting with his friend (and possibly most popular ship partner) Mikleo, the delusional and adorable Lailah, and the kuudere loli of the group, Edna.  To be honest, there's not much to say about any of these three since they're all about the same in terms of development.  They're Sorey's companions and both add quips and exposition to the story as needed.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, we have the princess of the town of Ladylake, Alisha.  With a strong sense of duty and a responsibility to take care of the people as the princess, Alisha is rarely used in the series.  She becomes the first human that Sorey interacts with, and there're some nice moments involving the two characters, but as a character, Alisha doesn't actually do much.  \\n\\n\r\nFrankly, none of these characters really do anything.  Trust me, there is a plot to this series, but the fact of the matter is that the show doesn't truly have anything to create any form of character development for any of the characters.  The side characters are pretty minimal and since the entire series is just basically the tutorial part of the game before you just get into the meat of it with every party member and every mechanic unlocked, there's really nothing that can be said for these characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+/-  Characters are interesting, but are all pretty minimal.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Ok, so uh...I swear the 10/10 thing in the art rating isn't a mistake.  As expected, Ufotable pulled out all of the stops to make this series look goddamn amazing.  And you know what?  It DOES look goddamn amazing.  The series looks similar to the style of animation that they gave Fate: UBW (compared to what they did to God Eater), and fluently meshes the bright and varied color palette with the mixture of CGI and handdrawn animation that's a work of art.  (There's even a town scene with several thousand tiny people walking with more than just 2 two cycling frames.  That's dedication if I've ever seen it.)\\n\\n\r\nAlso, as expected, the fight scenes look amazing.  They're fluent, they're engaging, and they have amazing effects that go along with Sorey's armantization forms that are beyond beautiful to look at.  Hell, the animation alone made me forget about all of the other aspects of the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Ufotable's artwork.  (Nothing else is needed here.)\\n\\n\r\nSound:  Kaze no Uta by Flow, the OP for Zestiria, is by far my favorite track in the entirety of the Summer 2016 season.  The adventurous and fantasy tone of the series was captured and has that kind of energy that makes you want to pick up a sword and defeat the Lord of Calamity yourself.  It's an invigorating piece that perfectly encapsulates the feel of the series and is an addicting song that'll probably on repeat for a few hours.  On the other hand, you have fhana's 'Calling', a song that's more mellow than its OP counterpart.  It's pretty standard fare for the singer and her band, so there's not really much to say for it, especially when you compare it to its OP partner.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is admittedly average at best.  It's good, but there's not really much to say for it or anything that needs special mention.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ KAZE NO UTA!  \\n\r\n+/-  Rest of the soundtrack was ok\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: Despite the show's flaws, this was definitely one of the more enjoyable series that I've seen all season.  Don't get me wrong, the fact that the story basically goes nowhere and the fact that nothing major actually happens throughout its runtime isn't a good thing, but damn, if you can make someone look forward to seeing more exposition and only a tiny inch towards the end, than you're...probably doing something right.  \\n\\n\r\nDid I like this series?\\n\\n\r\nOh yes.  I probably enjoyed it far more than I should've but hey, no matter its flaws, enjoying a show is still enjoying a show.  That being said, I'd probably lean towards the armatizations and other aspects of the fight scenes more to be my favorite parts of the series.  Oh, and the preview scenes that happen after the credits.  Those were pretty fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this series?\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, despite its numerous flaws, there's not really much of anything I hate.  Critically, the show has a lot of things that aren't so well-executed, but from the enjoyment side of things, this show was way more fun than it had any right to be.  (Especially the weird cut-in with the Berseria part.)\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this series?\\n\\n\r\nIf you want some good artwork, and you've already seen every other one of Ufotable's work, than Tales of Zestiria is a good choice to go for.  Personally, I'd say it's worth to consider its series purely for the art and the series's aesthetics.  They're so well made that you'll probably forget that the series only went to two towns and a mountain rather than any huge stretch of the adventure.  Actually though, in my opinion, this series is a ton of fun to watch.",

            "content": "The more time passes, the harder it gets to create an anime that truly stand out in their genre and most of them end up being very similar to their predecessors, only less memorable. With that in mind, Tales of Zestiria doesn't even try to set itself apart from all the other fantasy anime and ends up being a story that has been done 1000 times before and 1000 times better.\r\nLet's start with the story. Firstly, the setting couldn't be more generic. At first, it seemed interesting, because it was a village where these mythical beings known as Seraphim live and had some mystical ruinsthat revealed an ancient prophecy. But then the characters travel to a city that you feel like you've seen before, and after that to various locations with no personality (mostly wastelands and forests) that don't feel like they have any significance to the world or story.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing it too slow for an anime like this, and that wouldn't be a problem if the time in between fights wasn't filled with completely uninteresting dialogue that doesn't presentany interesting ideas and just exists so that there wouldn't be silence all the time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the story is all over the place and doesn't go in any direction. The characters would just travel to random locations and get rid of minor villains in order to make the world better. That might sound interesting to the casual viewer, but to me it's nothing that i haven't heard before. I never felt like there was a huge threat that needs to be defeated or a huge goal that needs to be achieved, and that is something indispensable in a great fantasy series. the conflict needs to feel epic and have a massive scale, i want to feel like the fate of the world is in the hands of these characters. They do talk about a war, which will probably happen in the nex season, but i never felt the urgency of this conflict approaching.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the characters, where should i even start? Our main character is a typical righteous guy who becomes \"The chosen one\" and strives to make the world a better place, without having any personality beyond that. Does that motivation sound interesting? Because to me, it doesn't. It is so vague and overused that it's become obnoxious. I can't care for him if he doesn't have a grand goal in his life. Naruto wants to be hokage, Luffy wants to find One Piece, Ed and Al want their bodies back, Guts wants revenge on Griffith and to bring Casca back to normal, why couldn't they give something like that to Sorey? \\n\\n\r\nAt first, he seemed like an acceptable character, but only until he dropped the line \"We don't have to kill them\" (referring to people that turned into evil monsters). That's when i almost lost all hope for this charaacter and realised he's just another righteous MC who tries to save everyone and doesn't understand that victory cannot come without sacrifice. This type of character can be done right, for example in shows like Fate/zero and Magi, by killing an important character and making the MC realise how delusional he was, thus helping with his development. But surprise, surprise, nobody dies in this anime because of the almighty plot armor.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast is even less memorable, because they have no personality at all and they are limited to their interactions and relationswith Sorey. They barely express any emotion and even when they do, it doesn't feel real because i don't care about them.\\n\\n\r\nNot to mention the villains are forgettable and not menacing a all, because there is no build-up before any confrontation and they are defeated with ease and no casualties on the side of the good guys.\\n\\n\r\nI have to give some credit to the action scenes. They were beautifully animated, with lots of particles flying around and giving a surreal feeling to the fights, and were mildly enjoyable throughout. However, i couldn't feel any tension during the fights or care too much about them, for reasons that i've mentioned above. I just didn't feel the weight of the situation or the stakes involved.\\n\\n\r\nUndoubtedly the strongest point of this anime was its art style. Not only did it fit the setting, giving it that ethereal aspect of a fantasy world, but it was also detailed and colorful without feeling saturated. The character and costume designs were impressively unique. Ever character was instantly recognisable just from their looks and clothing.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the soundtrack, it was fitting and immersive, contributing a lot to the overall atmosphere, but no track really stood out to me. All of the songs could have been used in any other fantasy anime and wouldn't be easily recognisable, unlike the dramatic choirs of Attack on Titan, the oriental music of Magi or the epic guitar riffs mixed with traditional japanese flute from Naruto.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, i found this anime as more of a weekly chore than an enjoyable watch, and i wouldn't recommend it, because for everything that it does, another anime does it better. You want an immersive and fascinating world with unique settings creatures? Watch Magi. You want great characters that can turn even a simple story into an amazing experience? Watch Rage of Bahamut. You want epic and beautifully animated fight scenes? Watch the Fate series. You want all of those in one? Watch FMA: Brotherhood. There are so many alternatives that i don't see why you would watch this instead.",

They are easily one of the top 3 studios for quality visuals. The only reason thing that could have been improved visually was the CGI dragons which felt a bit odd most of the time. Obviously this is ridiculously hard to get right though.\r\nMusic 7/10\r\nMusic was pretty generic and is more suited to a game, reminded me greatly of Dark Souls III wouldn't be surprised if it was the same composer(s). I enjoy this sort of music buta lot of people don't so it's a love it or hate it sort of deal.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters, Story, everything else 4/10\\n\\n\r\nWith all the awesome visuals in the world you can't make a boring story with boring character much less... boring.\\n\r\nI gave this anime a chance as I usually do when I hear something is mediocre, and more so because of Ufotable. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, with the story they had to work with I don't think they had much hope for success with this. The story is so generic, with generic characters and generic story progression. There isn't much that stands out sadly. \\n\\n\r\nOf course this was based on a game and I guess it follows that story so it can't stray too far from the source material which is it's major downfall. This story just isn't meant for this medium, it's meant for games where you can feel the progression. If they had rewritten the story to work well with anime I think it would have had potential.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR\\n\\n\r\nThis anime looks absolutely breathtaking as expected of Ufotable. However, the story is bland and generic, with characters just as generic and has nothing that grabs you, and makes you want to keep watching.",

            "content": "I've talked about Namco's Tales franchise twice before. With reviews of the Phantasia and Symphonia anime. Zestiria is one of the more recent games and the first series of its anime ran late last year. It was brought to us by Ufotable. You may recall them as the same studio that worked on the Symphonia OVA I looked at, and Gakuen Utopia Manabi Straight. How did they do with the first series of Zestiria? Let's have a look. Please note, this review includes the one episode prequel: Saiyaku no Jidai.\r\nStory:\r\nWe open with Princess Alisha sending a soldier to investigate a strange cloud overshadowing a cityunder her kingdom's jurisdiction. Just one of many calamitous events. Alisha and others are hoping for the legendary Shepherd to appear. All while preparations for a sword festival are taking place and Chancellor Bartlow is making preparations for a war that she's trying to prevent. As to why she can't pull royal rank on him and put him in a position where he has no power, I have no idea. She doesn't even have to go full Princess Usako and send him to \u201cprison island.\u201d In any case, time passes. She doesn't hear from the soldier she sent. So she takes several soldiers and goes to investigate herself. This eventually results in her finding her way to a strange land called Elysia where, supposedly, seraphim live. But all she can see are a bunch of buildings and a human boy about her age named Sorey. Sorey wants humans and seraphim to go back to living side by side and seems to see something in Elysia that Alisha can't.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest issue with this series is just that a lot of the plot points are pretty predictable. Of course, the boy who can see the seraphim goes to the sword festival and turns out to be the Shepherd. But that's not the extent of it. Nearly every plot point that they resolve in the first series goes exactly where you'd think it would. There's all of one moment where the narrative might surprise you. And even if that moment does, it's a very safe surprise. The series seems very hesitant to deviate too far from the conventional, generic path. The politics of the world are kind of unclear too. Now, in all fairness, the game does explain why the monarchy doesn't wield much power or respect and Bartlow can just be a dick towards the princess, but the anime never really addresses it. The problem being that it's kind of an important detail for understanding the story. Then we have the Velvet Crowe episodes. They aren't bad episodes by any metric but they are very much out of place. Basically, we get part of a completely different story inserted into this one for seemingly no reason. Unless the second series decides to have the two plot lines intersect, but that seems unlikely since Velvet is from a different game entirely.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending is a bit mixed. On one hand, it has some strong moments for the series and it does do a good job of giving some resolution while opening things up for a second series. However, it also suffers from having one of those \u201cthe antagonist has a chance to end the threat presented by the protagonist but decides not to bother for flimsy reasons\u201d moments. And those only really work in media for children. Not so much in something like this that's aimed at teens.\\n\\n\r\nOn the positive side, the series does do a good job at introducing enough plot elements to keep you invested in what's going on. The random Berseria episodes aside, it is well paced. I will also give them credit for having well executed plot points, even if they are obvious. I also do like the allusions to Arthurian legend.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are pretty decent. The issue that holds them back from being really good is that the main cast is only a step or two above archetypes, at least by the time the series ends. It's entirely possible that the second series of Zestiria will further develop their characters and make them more interesting. They certainly develop a bit in this one. They have conflicts, motivations and some pretty strong relationships. Particularly betwixt Sorey and Mikleo. The antagonists are just bland with no real sense of personality.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork in this is really good. The action sequences are really well done. The backgrounds are nicely detailed. The character designs can be silly in that JRPG aesthetic but they don't look bad. About the worst you get are the dumb feathers randomly clipped to Sorey's ears. In general, the worst thing I can say for the art is that it does feature some highly conspicuous CG moments. Which can be distracting.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe cast in this is really good. Kayano Ai, Koyasu Takehito, Satou Rina, Osaka Ryota & Shitaya Noriko all do really well in their roles. And there aren't any weak performances. The music is quite good.\\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nThere's not a whole lot. The series has the occasional scene that reads a tiny bit like homo-erotic subtext. Usually involving Alisha.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nthat's the first series of Tales of Zestiria the X. It has its strong moments. It has the basics down very well with the sound and art. The story, however, suffers from multiple bizarre decisions. Having a part of Berseria randomly inserted into the narrative. Not explaining the details you need to understand Alisha's circumstances. The series also really hasn't done enough to develop its characters at this juncture. Maybe if they'd done that instead of showing us a part of a completely different narrative for no reason. Still, it's a decent start and I am curious about the second series. I'll probably review that at some point after it's finished airing. But, for this one, I give it a 6/10. If you're a fan of the Tales franchise or even just fantasy works in general, give it a try. Next Week I'll look at Futari wa Precure Splash Star.",

            "content": "Short review: This anime has awesome graphics and shit story. \r\nDetailed review: I have been offended by many anime but never has an anime made me so angry. When it started, I thought to myself this anime might be just amazing. Oh boy was I wrong. It probably has one of the best graphics out there and they just go to waste as the story seems to be written by a teenager who is full of his own shit. I think the main audience for this show were stupid teenagers? But that's still no excuse for such horrible plot and story writing. The anime triesto be very philosophical but then it explains itself how the ideologies of the main characters is fucking bullshit. They try to add action in their anti-war philosophy and it's ridiculous. The action itself is awesome and entertaining. But it has the least amount of screen time and it doesn't fit well with the perspective of the story. Mostly the anime is filled with exposition scenes and even they are done horribly. And how characters interact seems so forced and fake that it gets on my nerves. And the overall plot is very predictable for first episodes. They meet new characters; the generic characters you'd except to join the group. You think to yourself that I bet they'll join the group and they do. Not to mention in the most ridiculous way. \"You should leave this place.\" \"Well I was thinking about that. Where are you going?\" \"I am going to find my friend.\" \"O lovely stranger, that I met 2 minutes ago, I want to come with you like we're the bestest friends. Also fist me daddy.\" (The character didn't necessarily say that but I am sure the scene would be on the same level of ridiculousness if that was said.)  This shit is fucking awful. To be honest it might not be so bad but the thing is I REALLY HATE THE FACT THEY PUT SO MUCH WORK INTO THIS SHIT. THE ART AND ACTION ARE SO AMAZING AND THE PLOT JUST MAKES YOU WANT TO BASH YOUR HEAD IN THE WALL. It's just very frustrating. And I forgot to mention the fact that the show is very terrible at trying to make us feel for the characters. They get a problem and it's treated to be unsolvable. You see the characters try again and then boom, they did it. They finally removed the great obstacle that they were having a lot of difficulty solving before. I mean HOW? HOW?? YOU LITERALLY FAILED DOING THE SAME SHIT A MINUTE AGO. HOW IS IT WORKING NOW?\\n\r\nAnd the protagonist. He is a great charmer. He  preaches peace and harmony and has to rid the world of malevolence. Humans create malevolence and when it becomes in excess it turns to demons. He \"purifies\" the demons and is against killing them. But they don't tell how killing them is different than purifying them or what purifying really is. As in purifying he is also hitting them with his sword and basically slaughtering them. One of the characters asks him, what he means by purifying. And he's like idk. SERIOUSLY WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH THIS SHIT. HOW LAZY OF A WRITER CAN YOU BE TO WRITE THIS SHIT AND THEN EVEN MAKE AN ANIME ON IT WITH SUCH HIGH BUDGET. This is plainly ridiculous. And that it folks. That was my review on Tales of Zestiria the anime that shouldn't have been made",

It didn't even have an atmosphere, something that the equally poorly paced God Eater (also produced by ufotable) at least had. \r\nWhat pisses me off the most is that the rules of this world seem to be written by a six year old: \"So there's these ruins, and then there's this hero who can see spirits but only he can, and then there's this princess who really likes him. And then he goes off to kill dragons and stuff.\" There's not much behindthe motivations of the characters. None of them even have much character outside of the trope slots that they occupy. The most interesting thing about them is their appearance, for which there is no rhyme or reason. \\n\\n\r\nAll throughout, I was waiting for the plot to truly open up.

            "content": "(This is a spoiler-free review adapted for this site)\r\n[Synopsis]: Tales of Zestiria takes place in a world where long ago, humans and supernatural beings called seraphim lived alongside one another. Over the years, humanity lost the ability to perceive the seraphim and they grew scarce as the negative emotions of humanity, a corrupting force called \u2018malevolence,\u2019 took root in the land. Legends speak of ancient saviors called Shepherds who would bridge the gap between the two beings however none have appeared and the world grows darker by the day. The story begins when Alisha Diphda (Kayano Ai), princess of the Highland Empire, encounters a youngman named Sorey (Kimura Ryouhei) who is able to perceive the seraphim and who may be the world\u2019s only hope of purifying the world\u2019s proliferating malevolence.\\n\\n\r\n[Characters]: \\n\\n\r\nAs one might expect given the show\u2019s RPG roots, Tales of Zestiria centers around Sorey and his party of friends consisting of both seraphim and humans. The show has a moderately sized supporting cast but they are mostly there for the main group of characters to bounce off of and don\u2019t receive much in the way of characterization themselves. Even the majority of Sorey\u2019s companions are fairly one-dimensional, typically sporting a pretty clear-cut personality and not much else. Alisha at the very least represents a controversial, pacifistic ideology which both drives her actions as well as the narrative near the end of the show. The cast is lightly entertaining but there isn\u2019t much in the way of depth to speak of.\\n\\n\r\nSorey himself is about as bland as protagonists come. He\u2019s upbeat, kindhearted, and his idealistic aspirations of the seraphim and humanity once again coexisting alongside each other paint him as a self-sacrificing, good-guy. There is a genuine sense of comradery between him and his close friend Mikleo however beyond this bond his interactions with others are pretty generically amicable. There isn\u2019t anything that sets him apart from other characters and his painfully straightforward, good-nature just further homogenizes him.\\n\\n\r\nOutside of the cast\u2019s straightforward personalities and Sorey\u2019s own uninspired characterization, the thing that is most lacking in regards to the cast is good, character-exploring dialogue. Tales of Zestiria has plenty of scenes about world-building, politics, and the supernatural elements that populate its world however there\u2019s hardly any time where the characters take a moment to flesh each other out. This wouldn\u2019t be so dearly missed if the show didn\u2019t revolve around a tight, party of friends. Their exchanges are amicable and everyone gets along but the vast majority of their dialogue is just spent on the exposition of what it means to be a Shepard and continuously reiterating the importance of Sorey\u2019s quest.\\n\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: \\n\\n\r\nUndoubtedly, it is in Tale of Zestiria\u2019s visual presentation where it best succeeds. The visual effects are marvelous and possess a grand sense of scale that really accentuates the fantastic world the characters live in and the magic present in each of the show\u2019s story elements. The background settings are gorgeous though sometimes they don\u2019t blend as well as they could with the characters, leading to an awkward effect where they look slightly out of place in juxtaposition to the vast and colorful backdrop behind them. This is infrequent and very minor however.\\n\\n\r\nThe city the cast stays in for a time felt alive and bustling \u2013 shop owners stood outside their stalls and stores, people gathered and passed each other in the streets, and they really brought the setting to life. The show\u2019s action scenes were well-animated, fluid, and exciting. As a whole, Tales of Zestiria is a great-looking show. It\u2019s grandiose and vibrant presentation did well in executing the feel of a fantasy world and though the characters were lacking in appeal, it remained exceedingly pretty to watch. Whether or not these fantastic visuals and great production are enough to fully carry one\u2019s interest in the show will depend on the viewer.\\n\\n\r\n[Story]: \\n\\n\r\nWhile Tale of Zestiria\u2019s cast of characters aren\u2019t as compelling as they could have been, the most significant blow to the show\u2019s quality stems from its horrible pacing. The epilogue drops the viewer into a a dark and sinister fantasy world full of ancient ruins, political intrigue, and a sinister, looming mist on the horizon. It\u2019s very light on exposition and the characters go about their tasks as they normally would though the viewer isn\u2019t really clued into the implications of what is happening \u2013 what the mist means, why the kingdom is in the state that it is, who the characters are, etc. The first episode then delves a bit further into the mythology behind Tales of Zestiria mentioned in the epilogue and doesn\u2019t do much to explain the previous events though it introduces us to Sorey and Mikleo. With Sorey\u2019s introduction, a critical issue arises.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the very beginning, it is painfully obvious that Sorey will become the Shepard of legend. His good-nature, belief in the legends of the Shepard, ability to see the seraphim, and dream of humans and seraphim coexisting once again all point directly at this. With that knowledge in mind, the show then proceeds to take 4 entire episodes (or 5 if you count the prologue) to finally unveil him as such when he takes up the sacred blade. Tales of Zestiria drags its feet in the extreme after introducing its characters and takes far too long to magnificently affirm for the viewer what they already knew. Just as the show finally arrives at the starting point of Sorey\u2019s epic quest to cleanse the malevolence from the land and save the world, we are launched into a two-episode side-story.\\n\\n\r\nThe midsection of the show presents a brief, two-episode flashback concerning the characters and events of a different game in the Tales franchise \u2013 Tales of Berseria, which takes place many, many years before the events of the current show in the same world. Just like the epilogue, the viewer is tossed into an unfamiliar setting full of new monster types, magic powers, world rules, classifications, histories, and implications. It unapologetically immerses the viewer in this new, darker story and the show never bothers to connect it to the overarching show the viewer is familiar with which leads to it feeling pretty much purely promotional.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the worst part of this is that Velvet Crowe, the protagonist of this two-episode interlude, is far and away more interesting than Sorey. Her story as well as the setting is grim and dark compared to the cheery and colorful aesthetic of Tales of Zestiria. Between what characterization she receives and her dramatic quest for revenge, Velvet and the story of Berseria are far more enticing than the story at large and despite our complete inability to understand a lot of the terminology being bandied about, it\u2019s more immediately interesting than the show it interrupted. It has a sense of purpose and direction that up until that point, Zestiria wasn\u2019t able to deliver on.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, with the advent of episode 8 and the end of the flashback, Sorey and his companions at last embark on a journey. Even then the direction of the story is a bit vague in what Sorey is actually supposed to be doing and how he is going to cleanse the world of malevolence but at least they leave the capital city and start fighting monsters and dragons. So to reiterate, the key issue with Tales of Zestiria is that it takes 5 episodes to tell the viewer what they already knew, takes 2 episode off to explore a completely different story, and then features one final episode of bustling around before it can finally develop the sense of adventure that the premise of the show initially promises. While it has a second cour waiting in the wings, this is no excuse for how painfully drawn out Tales of Zestiria\u2019s storytelling is and how underdeveloped its characters are.\\n\\n\r\n[Sound]: \\n\\n\r\nWhile not distinctly memorable, the music is grand and adventurous like the show\u2019s visuals and is well situated to the narrative. It\u2019s hard to recall any part of the soundtrack individually but its a good deal of fun and supports Tale of Zestiria\u2019s visual presentation very well.\\n\\n\r\n[Final Thoughts and Rating]: \\n\\n\r\nTales of Zestiria is kind of a mixed bag in that, while it\u2019s characters are enjoyable, they are also very plain \u2013 especially in the case of Sorey. Though the world, aesthetic, and overarching plot of the show might be interesting, the narrative dawdles and needlessly draws out what should take a far shorter time to explore. It\u2019s gorgeous to look at, wonderfully animated, and exhibits some really exciting action scenes however it never fully steps beyond the realm of \u2018eye candy\u2019 in its attempt to drum up a compelling story.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 6\\n\\n\r\nI gave Tales of Zestiria a 6 primarily because of its fantastic visuals but also due to its moderately entertaining characters and narrative. While it doesn\u2019t present the most engaging of stories and it takes far too long to arrive at its adventurous core, the show was entertaining to watch. Hopefully the subsequent installment of the series can better flesh out what the first season found lacking and really begin to develop a stronger narrative overall.\\n\\n\r\n[Recommendations]: \\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019ve enjoyed other game adaptations and enjoy that kind of \u2018party-dynamic\u2019 that the main cast represents, you\u2019re likely to enjoy Tales of Zestieria. Anybody looking for a visually stunning, very straightforward action, adventure show won\u2019t be disappointed with the show\u2019s subject matter. Tales of Zestiria is pretty much what it promises to be and so anyone intrigued by its premise or genre will likely find what they go looking for.",

            "content": "After 12 long weeks, Tales of Zestiria the X finally came to an end, or rather unfortunately, because it was fantastic. Even before the start of the Summer 2016 season I knew that I could expect much of an Ufotable fantasy, action and adventure anime. I did not play the game so I won't be able to tell you which one was better, the game or the anime adaptation. But what I can do for sure is write my impressions and thoughts on the anime in this review. I know I am a week late with it but I hope you still enjoy!\r\nPLOT AND STORYLINE\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned in the intro, Tales of Zestiria the X (ToZX) is an action, adventure and fantasy anime made by one of my favorite production studios-ufotable. Even before the anime started airing in July, 2016 I knew I'd love it because I've been waiting for so long for an anime like this. I wanted a good, action rich, fantastic, magical anime with a lot of legend and prophecies and stuff like that and ToZX delivers all of that. In addition to that, ToZX has a thrilling, uncommon and catchy story you just don't wanna miss. \\n\r\nThe anime follows Sorey, a human boy that lived his whole life with seraphim, spiritual beings that are not visible to humans. He strongly believes in the folk tale that says \"long ago, every human was able to see the seraphim\" and so his greatest wish is to find out a way how to make humans and seraphim live together in peace again. In his first visit to the capital, Sorey gets involved in an accident during which he pulls out the legendary sword of Ladylake from a rock and becomes the Shepherd-one who casts away calamity from the world. Even tough that is the main plot there is one more important story line trough out the anime. It is the story of Alisha Diphda, the princess of the Highland empire. She also believes the Seraphim folk tale and so finds a lot trust and support from Sorey and it soon becomes clear that they follow one and the same dream. While Sorey sets of on a journey to learn what it really means to be a Shepherd, Alisha fights for peace and stability in her own empire. \\n\r\nThe first thing that made my watch and later on love the anime was definitely the story. I was always a fan of anime that based their story on ancient legends, prophecies and myths. The legends about the seraphim caught me right form the beginning. It's a pitty that they didn't continue more with the legends from the ancient ruins that Sorey explored together with his seraph friend Mikelio in the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nMoreover, ToZX delivers a lot of epic fights nad breathtaking action scenes. It is so magical and so amazing to see the seraphim Lailah, Mikelio and Edna fight calamity with Sorey. Besides, the powers of the three seraphim are based on the power of the four elements fire, water, earth and I think we'll meet an air seraphim in the second season. I've always loved this kind of magic and powers and I think every magic and fantasy fan will. The thing I found the most interesting in the anime is one more side-story that appears somewhere  in the middle of the anime with Crowe as the main character. It kinda came out of nowhere and with no connection to Sorey and Alisha at all. I am sure that they'll meet later in the anime and I actually just can't wait to see what will happen then. \\n\r\nNow if you ask whether Tales of Zestiria the X has a moral or a deeper meaning in the story, I'd say Yes, it does. The whole seraphim/human story is not the actual moral, but more the part with the calamity. War, fights, corruption and so on result in calamity or easier said: we create the demons that destroy our world and that's exactly what ToZX wants to show. The anime keeps you on tenterhooks the whole time and I personally just couldn't wait for next Sunday just to watch the new episode. Unfortunately, the first season of Tales of Zestiria the X came to an end last Sunday. Still, the anime was a huge success so I think it is not wrong to expect another season soon. *fingers crossed*\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nTruth is I loved Tales of Zestiria the X a lot, but it is still not a perfect 10/10. Unfortunately the characters lack in originality. Firstly you have Sorey who is the average main character. He is the hero of every situation and his actions are mainly predictable. Gladly, he is not the annoying type of main character because that could have ruined  the anime in many ways. Also the female protagonist of the story, Alisha is a common character you've seen in other anime too. She is a brave and independent character that always fights for justice. I've always loved strong and independent female characters but to be honest, they became boring over time. I loved Erza, Yona, Kallen, Akame etc. but now I am more a fan of arrogant villains such as Gilgamesh from Fate/ UBW. The only character that I though had more depth in her personality was Clowe. She is presented as the \"bad guy\" in the story but I think there is much more to it. Even tough we could see her in only 3 episodes (i think) I got the feeling that she is an extremely strong yet caring character with a thug past.  I hope we'll get to see more of her in the next season. \\n\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION AND STYLE\\n\\n\r\nWhat to say? I mean, it's an unfotable production. The production studio with the best animation of all. The animation of Tales of Zestiria the X is just fantastic, amazing, marvelous, magical, incredible, stunning, wonderful...I think you understand now how good it is. There is not a single flaw in the animation or the anime style. The style is also very unique and beautiful. The thing where you really get to see how good both, the animation and the style, are are the action scenes and the backgrounds. You just cannot believe how good it is. It is like a fantasy for your eyes. You cannot but enjoy it.  Lastly, I think I have the right to say that this is the best animation I have ever seen in my life. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude this review, Tales of Zestiria the X was a huge success. With a unique and intriguing story and an ufotable animation this anime could not but be amazing. And true the characters lack in originality but I think we can forgive the makers because they did everything else incredibly good. I haven't watched a lot anime form the Summer 2016 season but I am sure that Tales of Zestiria the X was among the better ones.",

The first few episodes felt very rushed. It felt strange because each episode  was jumping around from one giant battle to the next. It just felt like they didn't leave enough space for the characters to develop their relationships early on. They keep throwing more and more characters at you each episode. and this makes it very difficult to relate to many of the characters because they have these rushed introductions, and there are just so manycharacters but simply not enough time to make them develop all the characters. Even though the main plot for the story is a very generic chosen one story. It was still enjoyable to watch.",

            "content": "Tales of Zestiria the X, in my opinion is a good anime if you like action and adventure. It tells a tale of Sorey, a human and a seraphim  (like a hybrid) who lives with a old man and his best friend Mikleo on a island far up in the sky. It's a place that's closed to man because seraphim and man do  not co-exist anymore. Sorey and Mikleo both like exploring ruins, but more importantly they've started becoming fond of the outside world and what it had it to offer. Until one day Alisha came looking for the Shepherd. (The one thatcan stop all the evil in the world 'malevolence') and the rest if for you to watch. \\n\\n\\n\r\n(That is if you want to, to be honest the show is very good and the art is very nice indeed. Just remember this is a anime for a game as well, just like god eater.)",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nTales of Symphonia is one of my favorite GameCube games that I played when I was kid.\r\nI don\u2019t remember it all too well now, having not gone through it for many, many years. But I do recall something silly I did with it.\r\nI read a strategy guide that stated (and I had to go online to make sure I was remembering this right because I wasn\u2019t) if I only used Lloyd\u2019s wooden blades up until a certain point, I would unlock a special title. Being unable to pass up on such a sweet deal, despitebeing well into the game at this point, I erased my file, started anew, and became the \u201cEternal Apprentice.\u201d (Not the most flattering of achievements.)\\n\\n\r\nThinking back on it, it was not a good move to do that at all. It wasn\u2019t even necessary. But I liked the game so much, I didn\u2019t care. It gave me an excuse to play the opening sections again and enjoy the experience once more.\\n\\n\r\nTales of Zestiria the X instantly reminded me of Symphonia for obvious reasons. Sadly, I won\u2019t be remembering Zestiria quite as fondly.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nZestiria begins shortly where the prequel episode left off. Alisha finds herself within a set of ancient ruins dedicated to the fabled Shephard. Upon \u201cdiscovering\u201d a secret alcove and running into Sorey, a young boy living among the Seraphim, destiny\u2019s wheels start to churn.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is based on a very popular video-game series known as the Tales of franchise. Each game (more or less) features a group of likely heroes, a fantastical setting, and an adventure to take out some great evil. Furthermore, each story is different. The cast and the plot change with each iteration without much (if any) crossover between them.\\n\\n\r\nZestiria follows this formula, too. Alisha, Sorey, Mikleo, Lailah, Edna, and Rose join forces in a world filled with dragons, magical transformations, and a capital city sprawling with festivities. Their fights against monsters, the idea that goodness prevails over evilness, and a plethora of otherworldly elements turn the anime into a common yet classic fantasy adventure.\\n\\n\r\nAs they traverse the land, Zestiria focuses on a major plot point that ties into one of its biggest themes: Malevolence. What creates these monsters and causes the townspeople to succumb to sickness are negative emotions. Anger, hatred, envy. Such thoughts, such Malevolence, seep into the very fabric of the world and its denizens, summoning forth hellions (the anime\u2019s word for the demons), inciting mean-spirited-ness and restarting the cycle anew.\\n\\n\r\nThe show depicts this in various ways. A hidden antechamber filled with the souls of executed prisoners. Men turned into hellions due to conflict and despair. Wars fought with only bloodshed in mind.\\n\\n\r\nThe severed connection between humans and Seraphim also gets at the overabundance of Malevolence. Because people have lost sight of goodness, the Seraphim remain unknown to almost everyone. Mikleo will sometimes comment as such, and Lailah warns Sorey of the difficulties he will face at the hands of purging human-bred Malevolence. Regardless, the anime makes it clear that negativity breeds more negativity, and the only way to stop it is for righteousness to reign.\\n\\n\r\nZestiria has enough there to start it off on the right path. The fantasy structure, the Malevolence motif, and the mixture of the two give it a solid (albeit tried-and-true) setting.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately for the anime, way too many problems prevent it from following that path correctly.\\n\\n\r\nIts most obvious blunder occurs during the middle of its run. After the first four episodes, once Sorey officially (and expectedly) becomes the Shepherd, and right after a cliffhanger, the anime spends two episodes on an entirely different plot.\\n\\n\r\nThat is, a completely new iteration of the Tales of series, entitled Tales of Berseria, takes the focus. It follows a woman named Velvet Crowe as she escapes from prison with the plan to avenge her younger brother who was murdered before her eyes.\\n\\n\r\nThis diversion would have been at least warranted had the anime afterwards referenced these episodes. But it doesn\u2019t. From the events depicted to the characters themselves, what happens is never mentioned again.\\n\\n\r\nIt would be as if, in the middle of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, the story spent forty minutes on a set of characters named John, Mark, and Tammy as they go to the wizarding school of Pigblisters, only to have them and their exploits never talked about or shown again.\\n\\n\r\nIt has no relevance. It breaks continuity. And it is downright unacceptable.\\n\\n\r\nDisregarding these two episodes, Zestiria\u2019s narrative has its own problems. The biggest being something fundamental: what actually goes on. In essence, the anime is a bunch of random quests strung together that lack any worthwhile connection. Sorey and the others move from location to location, performing singular tasks that either don\u2019t lead into the next in a plot-related fashion or aren\u2019t resolved at all. It makes the story feel both disjointed and without a clear sense of direction.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime does its best to have a couple of goals. One is that Sorey will visit the different Shepherd ruins around the world as he cleanses the Malevolence. The second is that he will try to reestablish the connection between humans and Seraphim, finding clues at said ruins. But neither goal is tackled in a meaningful way in this first season.\\n\\n\r\n(Technically the second happens since Alisha does finally see the Seraphim she always read and dreamed of. However, that\u2019s on an individual scale and not the worldly scale that the story aims for.)\\n\\n\r\nThe set of dragon episodes is particularly egregious. Not only does Sorey\u2019s trek to defeat the dragon nesting there end in failure, but it introduces a random character that does not appear again. Plus, the dialogue devolves into the same \u201cno dragons have ever been returned back to normal\u201d (or something similar) phrase. Edna at least joins the party, but any other set of events could have happened, and the outcome would have been the same.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the party, the anime has trouble here, too. Sorey and the group are almost never all together. Alisha is forcibly summoned, Mikleo goes off on his own mini quest, and Rose doesn\u2019t officially join until this first season\u2019s conclusion. Without a solid, stable group, one of its own key fantasy elements \u2013 a full cast of heroes \u2013 is lost the whole way through.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s also the main-villain reveal and how oddly its handled. He just shows up. Partly because of all the Malevolence floating about the battlefield, partly because the anime realized it needed a proper antagonist of some sort. His whole going-to-crush-Sorey-at-his-peak does make some sense since, by crushing Sorey (and as he similarly puts it), he would then also destroy the epitome of hope. However, it\u2019s a very sorry excuse to let Sorey continue on in the story, and it stops these two from adequately forming a good-versus-evil relationship.\\n\\n\r\nOn top of the anime reducing the importance of the trickster in favor of the spectacle, the anime forgetting about the old-man Seraphim, the missing build-up to the war, and the final bit of \u201cdrama\u201d with the Malevolence-driven general, it\u2019s clear the story has troubles.\\n\\n\r\nBut, realistically, that Tales of Berseria diversion did enough harm on its own.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nZestiria is quite the beautiful anime.\\n\\n\r\nOften, it will take the time to show off a scenic landscape: Sorey standing at the edge of a cliff looking out at a setting sun and colored sky, Alisha walking through a green grove caressed by the mist of a waterfall. It gives the show the fantastical feel that it strives for by giving the audience a sprawling bunch of picturesque places.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, many of the locations aren\u2019t given their just detail. Open plains, rough mountains, and other scarce spots provide ample working room for the cast to battle. But these less-than-interesting backgrounds make the audience yearn for the more majestic shots that the show has shown it can produce.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest exception being the capital of Lady Lake. Its festivity-filled plaza, the myriad of people lining the streets, and a royal castle make it the only area in Zestiria that always aims high.\\n\\n\r\nEven so, it\u2019s very hard to deny the various degrees of lighting, the sharpness of each shot, and the lack of any noticeable visual mishaps. It\u2019s without argument a pretty show through and through.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on but not without relation, the character designs are similarly strong. Alisha\u2019s design is quite nice with her white-and-pink armor, side ponytail and curls, and sparkling green eyes. Edna goes for the cute look: short boots, charming umbrella, and multiple accessories like a choker and a hairband.\\n\\n\r\nEven Sorey gets a nod. While his regular Shephard outfit, complete with long cloak and blue undershirt, give him that main-character look, his transformations provide the dazzle. Lailah fusing with Sorey changes his appearance accordingly. The white, yellow, and red coloring surround him with an angelic aura that befits his Seraphim connection. (Similar thoughts are had for both Mikleo and Edna\u2019s transformations.)\\n\\n\r\nActual animation also remains high in quality throughout the entire season. Not just in flowing hair during high winds or blinking eyes when they speak. But where it matters most: the fight scenes. The multitude of magics used, Sorey\u2019s highflying acrobatics, and even the different CG uses blend together to create flashy fights with enough explosions and pizzazz to wow anybody.\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, Zestiria has perhaps one-too-many sitting-and-or-standing-while-talking segments that do not invite a whole lot of dynamism. Still, the cleanliness of these downtime shots, and what the show offers when it does pick up, make up for this avoidance of movement.\\n\\n\r\nTwo final points. One positive and one strange.\\n\\n\r\nThe positive is the previews for each episode. Sorey and the others face the audience in a \u201ctwo-dimensional\u201d fashion with predetermined reactions. These small segments match the dialogue ones from the main games, adding to the overall charm of the show itself.\\n\\n\r\nThe strange is the ending track\u2019s visuals. It shows all the members of the cast hanging out and having fun as separate pairings or groups. It\u2019s misleading since such interactions are rarely shown between those depicted, let alone the anime showing them all together at once. Perhaps it implies that they will all, in fact, eventually be together. But, for now, they\u2019re not, so it\u2019s an intriguing decision to show them as such to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nWhile Zestiria\u2019s art and animation step up its game, its characters bring it back down.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest issue of the bunch being Sorey.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime establishes him as a plain, kind, and straightforward man. Not an issue. For that\u2019s what makes him the Shepherd of his age. A person capable of uniting both the people and the Seraphim through his righteousness and purity.\\n\\n\r\nNo, what makes him a weak character is how he becomes who he is. Not the pulling-the-sword-from-the-stone event which arguably marks his best moment. It\u2019s what the anime does \u2013 or more precisely doesn\u2019t \u2013 to build his foundation.\\n\\n\r\nSorey\u2019s knowledge of all-things Shepherd is excused by the village he grew up in and the book that he practically read about one-thousand times. Problem is, his childhood is never shown, let alone him interacting with the other Seraphim. And already having all the knowledge necessary to tackle the path before him, as though it was gained by default, makes said path a rather easy one.\\n\\n\r\nIn other words, it\u2019s odd to see him just inherently know or understand everything about being a Shephard. Sorey simply just does it without awe, questioning, or issues. He knows how to fight using weapons and acrobatics. He knows the rituals to make pacts. He knows the ins and outs of his situation.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s even odder when one remembers that he has been kept away from humans for almost his whole life. So, when he has little to no worries as he walks around, dealing with the problems and newness of it all in stride, it reduces roundness of his character that much more.\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, he does grow more powerful as the Shepherd by not needing to dull his senses so that Alisha can gain an audience with the Seraphim. And he learns more about the world he never knew such as with the Malevolence that permeates everywhere.\\n\\n\r\nBut the former is not exactly the best indicator of his growth since it just naturally happens and, indeed, does not have the same level of importance as, say, his skills or his own conflicts. And the latter doesn\u2019t actually change his mindset. In fact, it only hardens his resolve to continue his goodness. Expected but uninteresting.\\n\\n\r\nAltogether, Sorey has no backstory. No chances at personal growth. No anything. He just accepts it all, so the audience must as well.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, and arguably, he\u2019s the Shepherd, so perhaps it\u2019s required that he is so conveniently suited for this job. The show isn\u2019t some dark, twisted drama that demands the utmost realism. Indeed, it\u2019s a fantasy adventure with a nice guy at its helm. Meaning, it\u2019s okay if Sorey is bit on the flat side.\\n\\n\r\nEven if that\u2019s the case, since the anime gave him a personality, gave him a big group of friends to travel with, and gave him this opportunity, more should be had. Plus, a story is being told and presented on its own, so needing a strong protagonist is not something crazy.\\n\\n\r\nMany of the others fair just as miserably. For example, Mikleo boils down to a single phrase: \u201cSorey!\u201d No matter how close he is with his best friend, Mikleo shouts out Sorey\u2019s name way too much, turning him from a worthwhile sidekick and into a broken record.\\n\\n\r\nZestiria tries to give him his own purpose through an ancient-artifact-acquisition side-quest. But, since the trek has no conflict for him to overcome besides walking far, all it does is make him a broken record that also wields a bow.\\n\\n\r\nEdna does not appear until the halfway mark of the season. She\u2019s a bit snarky, but she has her heart in the right place.\\n\\n\r\nHer main conflict revolves around a rogue-brother-turned-dragon. However, the miniscule flashback she gets and the anime not incorporating her appropriately beyond her introductory episodes puts her in a valueless spot. To the point that she essentially becomes the cute sidekick that occasionally says mean-yet-playful words.\\n\\n\r\nLailah had been waiting at Lady Lake for the Shepherd to appear and, when Sorey did, she joined his cause, believing in him and his actions.\\n\\n\r\nIn essence, Lailah is the guider. A teacher of sorts that looks out for all of them. That, is, she is purely a support character (at least for now) since almost nothing else is known or learned about her. She has her niceness and her very occasional cute moments, but next to nothing noteworthy. An overall neutral character.\\n\\n\r\nThat leaves Rose and Alisha. Arguably speaking, they are the strongest characters that Zestiria crafts.\\n\\n\r\nThe first time the audience sees Rose is the first time Sorey interacts with another human besides Alisha. Rose sneaks him into the city with her trading background, proving her helpful nature from the get-go (as well as her tradesman skills). Plus, her lighthearted personality makes her immediately likable, making it a shame to see her leave to take care of her \u201cbusiness.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nQuoted because that business is not selling goods but rather killing royalty.\\n\\n\r\nNow, while it\u2019s already known or at least incredibly obvious that Rose and her troupe are the assassins hired by Alisha\u2019s governmental enemies (thanks to the prequel episode and the not-so-subtle tells), it stands as an interesting character detail. Alisha\u2019s \u201cpolicy of non-aggression\u201d is something many of the higherups do not agree with. Same for Rose. So, they and she take it upon themselves to counter Alisha\u2019s initiative.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, Rose does not appear for a long while. Not until the village that Sorey and the Seraphim saved. There, she goes from enemy to friend, signifying her change in position with Alisha.\\n\\n\r\nGranted, her transition was underwhelming. Alisha just says a few words to convince Rose, and the whole double-walking-away-all-cool-like isn\u2019t the grandest of ways to end their conversation. But at least she converts and proves her newfound thinking by helping Alisha and going with Sorey as the first season concludes.\\n\\n\r\nAlisha is arguably the best character of Zestiria. In her own words, \u201cI, Alisha Diphda, absolutely forbid vengeance.\u201d To her, maintaining honor and doing what\u2019s right, even if that means losing or succumbing to attacks, takes precedence over everything else. This makes her out to be a strong leader \u2013 with many an enemy.\\n\\n\r\nLike Rose, she proves herself through her actions. Given her status, she does not have to do anything. Yet she takes it upon herself to uphold her ideals. She includes the sword-pulling ceremony to inspire hope in the people. She tends to the sick and the weary miles from the safety of the castle. She leads the brave men and women that follow her into war.\\n\\n\r\nDespite her stalwart personality and grounded thoughts, she, more than any other human, believes firmly in the legends. Of the Seraphim that light this world and the Shepherd who will one day save everyone from calamity.\\n\\n\r\nHow fitting, then, that much of her character centers on the Seraphim. Stumbling accidentally into their home, reading the same book as Sorey growing up, and slowly but surely interacting with Mikleo and the others like him.\\n\\n\r\nAll of which culminate into the best writing moment in the whole season. After becoming a Squire of Sorey\u2019s through their pact (earning the true name \u201cSmiling Alisha\u201d), she finally gets to see the Seraphim with her own eyes. While she always knew of them and could even hear them, viewing them in front of her made for a nice scene and capped off her character well enough for the season.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s unfortunate that many of the other characters were not handled similarly. Especially Sorey. But, hopefully, the second season takes to correcting these issues.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe opening track of Zestiria is a bit stronger than perhaps at first perceived. It mixes together many different instruments: guitar, bagpipes, violin, drums, shakers, chimes. They don\u2019t overpower one another. In fact, they do well in supporting the vocalist as he moves from empowered yelling to reserved singing. While the track itself is not the catchiest around, its small flourishes in pace and tune \u2013 like with the dancing violins in the middle, the harmonizing in the second half, and the faster lyrics near the end \u2013 place it in a nice spot.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending track is much slower, using such pacing to deliver a slightly happy tune. It aims for a more emotional level with its higher vocal ranges and heavier reliance on piano and violin. This direction is especially evident near the song\u2019s conclusion when everything comes to a crescendo. Again, not the most memorable of pieces, but it\u2019s still a solid track nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nThe original soundtrack does a lot to build Zestiria\u2019s atmosphere while maintaining that fantastical feel. A mysterious tune filled with plucking harp strings. Choir sections for those tense or victorious moments. Fanciful flutes so the downtime feels that much more relaxed. Arguably speaking, the OST comes out as the winner of the musical offerings.\\n\\n\r\nSound-effects are on point, too. Dragons bellowing loudly, Sorey firing an arrow, the clashing and clanging of armor. Alongside the calamitous sounds of a raging tornado or of a torrent of rain, the anime fills the air with a myriad of sounds that reinforce the different encounters and scenes with ease.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, there were no notable voice-acting performances.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nThis one falls somewhere in the middle for me.\\n\\n\r\nMostly due to the characters. Sorey is a cool dude, but he is much too plain. Mikleo means well in supporting his friend, but he didn\u2019t do too much to capture my attention. Lailah had a cute pout or two, but she wasn\u2019t as charming as she seemed she could be. Edna brought a bit of fun with her silly nicknames, but wasn\u2019t given the time to say a whole lot. Rose had the most interesting background, but showed up the least.\\n\\n\r\nGiven how this season ends, the characters may have the chance to make up for their missing intrigue. But, for now, they sit in that quasi state of likable but not really entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nThe only character I have yet to mention is Alisha, for she is the one I consider my favorite. I liked her stalwart behavior in the face of conniving political fiends and traders-turned-killers out to get her. Moments like when she first heard the Seraphim, and her sincere gratitude towards them when they saved the village from the plague, were heartwarming to watch.\\n\\n\r\nWhile it would have been sad for Alisha to die following the war, it would have easily made the anime more interesting on both an emotional and thematic level. But the show chickened out instead. Granted, that led to arguably the best moment in the whole season \u2013 Alisha finally seeing the Seraphim in person \u2013 but, had the show killed her off, it would have demonstrated that it wasn\u2019t afraid to try something daring.\\n\\n\r\nIt also does not help, though, that Alisha apparently leaves the party altogether, or at least for a long while, as she fights on her home turf in the meetings rather than in a foreign land on the battleground. Meaning, my favorite character most likely won\u2019t be around as much as I would like come this second season.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the fights, it was mixed. A lot of them were rad due to their shininess. Sorey and Mikleo purifying the dragon at the small village was particularly awesome. However, many of the battles were just against a giant baddie (a transparent beast, a giant river worm), so they missed out on nuance and variety. It\u2019s what made Rose and Alisha\u2019s fight against Alisha\u2019s countrymen the most interesting because Rose\u2019s martial-arts moves actually gave something else besides the magic.\\n\\n\r\nAnd so, all in all, while I wish the best for the anime, I don\u2019t see myself picking up its continuation anytime soon.\\n\\n\r\nTales of Zestiria the X already has one strike in its title but chose to earn a few more throughout its run. The art is enticing, but the story\u2019s interruption makes no sense, and Sorey is a tame protagonist. As far as can be remembered, it\u2019s an \u201cEternal Apprentice\u201d until proven otherwise.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Terrible, a motif on Malevolence and the negativity of man gets overshadowed by questionable plot choices, a lack of cohesion between its separate events, and a completely unnecessary narrative diversion\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Great, pretty background art, clean visuals, nice character designs, and above average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Bad, Sorey stagnates from the beginning, Mikelo, Lailah, and Edna do little outside of their singular roles, and Rose and Alisha have at least a couple of interesting moments\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, okay OP, okay ED, good OST, nice sound-effects, and okay VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Fine, Alisha was cool, the others were fun on occasion, and the action was shiny, but nothing enthralling\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 4/10",

            "content": "The first thing that caught my eye was the story synopsis and that's the reason I watched this Anime series, and I must admit a really enjoyed watching it up until the end. Yes it might be your typical Fantasy, hero clich\u00e9, but there is something about Tales of Zestiria that was enjoyable and fun to watch. The only negative thing that I would say is that I would have rather introduced Tales of Berseria in episode 13 & 14 rather than introducing it right almost at the beginning and they could have put in a little bit more into Tales of Zestiria. But tobe honest I am looking forward to watching Tales of Berseria when it gets released.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\nThe story line might be a little bit predictable at times and it goes the same for the MC or Hero, but if you think about it aren't most anime a little bit predictable in some way or form. However the story line is simple and easy to understand and there is nothing to complex about it. So for this alone I will score it a 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nThe Art work done on the characters and landscape was breathtaking and really done well. Colours are bright and vibrant and the landscape and scope of each scenary was so well done so for the Art I will score it a solid 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nCharacter development might be in some cases a bit slow and it is evident in the main Hero but over time each character development moves at a well balanced pace as the viewer progress through each episode. I would be honest and say I would like to see some more character development in our heroes but that will come with time if a season to is rolled out, but at the end of the day I am still scoring this a 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nThe series to me was very enjoyable and a lot of fun to watch. Yes in some cases the pace of the series was slow but at other times it was really fast paced. The action scenes are well done and beautifully displayed but not overly done. So I am scoring this section a 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nMost Anime fans will have mixed opinions or feelings about this show but I really enjoyed it a lot and I do hope a season 2 gets released soon. So I would recommend this to the fans of Tales of Zestiria and if there are any new comers as well please take the time to watch this Anime you might feel like I am or maybe not. But I really enjoyed the series and it was a lot of fun so im scoring it a 9/10.",

            "content": "The world is in chaos; malevolence seeps out of the Earth itself and engulfs all in despair. But fear not, for you, who can see and speak with the Seraphim deity shall herald a new era as the legendary shepherd. The decisions you make and the relationships you forge shall shape the future of humanity. Tales of Zestiria the X is the anime adaption of the successful RPG franchise, and ufotable sure did a great job retaining the RPG-like feel.\r\nIf you're like me and have never set foot in Zestiria land, fear not for the story gently eases you into this deep and rich worldfull of elemental magic and unspoken horrors. If you like good stories in the medieval-based fantasy genre, this should be right up your alley. Though I had my doubts coming in, ufotable has given us a great addition to the medieval fantasy genre.\\n\\n\r\n[b]Animation:[/b]\\n\r\nThough the animation isn't exactly always up to my expectations for ufotable, the overall quality is still many levels above your average show. Expect lots of lush scenery with great detailing along with superb lighting and shading. Whether in Tomb Raider like crypts or bustling street markets, the atmosphere is well presented. Some of the overlook vistas are particularly impressive with rich backgrounds and detailed clouds. I'm a bit more mixed from the 3D CGI perspective. Mob villagers and carriages are fairly drawn overall but you can still tell that they move differently than the protagonists in the foreground. Water and fire effects are brilliantly done, literally approaching realistic levels. Monsters... not so much. The dragons and other creatures look fake and have unnatural movements. The characters are well drawn in a unique style; the coloring is rather flat with minimal shading. This style contrasts sharply with the highly detailed, variably lit backgrounds; it takes a bit to get used to but isn't particularly distracting or annoying. I will say that one aspect I wasn't particularly sold on is character expressions; the still sprites in the post credit previews are about as exciting expression-wise as you're going to see in the show. Sorey's shepherd outfit, along with those ear clips, also gives him a bit of a Native American flair.\\n\\n\r\nExpect a good deal of action in this show along with a fair amount of blood and occasional death. The action is high intensity and the show is blessed with very good choreography and excellent effects. Though \"purifications\" aren't as special as say the equivalent in God Eater, there are plenty of varied fights. Velvet Crowe is rather scantily clad I guess but otherwise this isn't an ecchi-based work.\\n\\n\r\n[b]Sound:[/b]\\n\r\nThough appropriate for the genre, I wouldn't consider the sound package anything special. The OP is a rather refreshing light rock piece with a good melody and unique wind instrumentation. The ED is a slow piece with some nice instrumentation but could use a more definitive melody. The BGM is pretty airy with some uplifting, exploration/adventure themed choral tracks. The other pieces are more ordinary and rather forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nThe VA cast for this series is incredible; listing the notable, veteran VAs from here would literally take a paragraph. Let's just say the main cast is all pretty strong, though I particularly liked Mikako Komatsu, Noriko Shitaya, and Ai Kayano's performance. For the Berseria arc, Rina Satou shines in the main role and we also get to hear Satomi Arai voice a non-loli for once. This is definitely one show that's not short on talent.\\n\\n\r\n[b]Story:[/b]\\n\r\nZestiria starts off with a very bleak and saddening starting chapter; this truly is a very unforgiving world. However, from then on, it plays out literally like an RPG in video form; i.e. you meet the protagonist, learn whom the final boss is, and start hacking away at quests, and meeting important NPCs er... supporting characters along the way. I wouldn't call the setting particularly original, obviously it borrows the sword in the stone concept from King Arthur and fusion abilities from numerous other anime shows, but the seraphim were a pretty interesting touch, and the norin (though still partially a mystery) are rather cute.\\n\\n\r\nThe actual story consists of one single central plot with various character introductions along the way, each of which has subplots (i.e. quests). There are a few cliffhangers, one of which is oddly prolonged by a random two-episode introduction to Tales of Berseria. The story builds to an eventual climax where Sorey gets his chance at being Kira Yamato. This climax and the resolution are pretty good but also rather predictable. This really is just one arc in one giant story, and they sure go out of their way to announce that a sequel is already in the works.\\n\\n\r\nThe show has a decent mix of comedy, adventurous exploration, and battle. There's a fair amount of talk time and a decent amount of political dealings in the background, especially around our princess. There isn't a consistent mood in this show however; it ranges wildly from utterly hopeless to jubilant celebration. In general, despite some bleak scenes, I'd say the show is rather optimistic.\\n\\n\r\n[b]Character:[/b]\\n\r\nSurprisingly, there's a lot of characters that I don't particularly like in this show. Our protagonist Sorey is painfully naive. This enables him to have rather grand goals in life but also makes him ridiculously defenseless against guile and women. Though quite powerful as a warrior, he just isn't relatable at all. Sorey is almost always shadowed by his Seraphim friend, Mikleo, who I have no doubt is the target of multiple yaoi doujinshi. We also have a princess in this show, who reminds me of her counterpart in Aldnoah Zero; she does a lot of grunt work on the front lines but never seems to be taken seriously by the politicians. Her selflessness is admirable though, combined with her personality, makes her feel reserved and distant. Honestly, Lailah and Rose are really the only redeeming feature in terms of personality for this show, and even they are rather static characters.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a huge secondary cast with numerous names, allegiances, and abilities to keep track of. What really got me confused was how so many of the characters seemed to already know each other (protagonist not included). Really, many of the characters were just barebones, just enough to further the plot. Honestly, this is not the strongest section for this show.\\n\\n\r\n[b]Value:[/b]\\n\r\nThis is a rich world full of creatures, abilities, and yet to be solved mysteries. It is a bleak world, but one that has one hope, and that is our protagonist Sorey; how he has not amassed a harem of followers yet I do not know. Zestiria's story is deep and involved, and full of elements still to be explained. It's an interesting, and engaging watch, though unfortunately the characters aren't as deep as I had hoped. Nevertheless, with ufotable's production and a huge cast of VA veterans on board, this is still a show you shouldn't miss.\\n",

            "content": "THERE WILL BE SPOILERS FOR THIS REVIEW! Please don't read any further if you don't want to be spoiled!\r\nOkay, so. I really, REALLY wanted to like Tales of Zestiria the X. I truly did. If I hadn't played the game first I think I'd have enjoyed it a lot more than I did, but after playing the game and then watching the series... I can safely say that as much as I didn't like the game like that much, I preferred it to the mess that was this first season.\r\nOverall yes, I enjoyed it. Mostly because I kept reminding myself that the anime and thegame were going to be separate. It was why I forgave a few things, but the story was just so abysmal that I cannot find it within myself to excuse it. I'm not even sure where to START to be honest, there are just so many things I want to say.\\n\\n\r\nFirst off, the pacing felt too slow at the start and then too rushed at the ending. I'm aware they had to do this because they can't fit absolutely everything into the game in just a few short episodes, however, it felt far too clunky for my liking. It just took too long to get the ball going, and it suffered immensely by including two Berseria episodes halfway through. It just didn't fit right and while it was fantastic to see my favourite characters from Berseria (Magilou is BEST GIRL) it took away a lot from Zestiria.\\n\\n\r\nThere was also just far too many changes for my liking. The explanation of malevolence in the game is a bit more extensive and complicated, but it's a lot better than what we were told in the anime. Yes, humans generate malevolence that thus turns them into hellions, but afterwards, the explanation just falls flat and nothing is mentioned about it again. It's frustrating, extremely frustrating.  A change that I also didn't know how to feel about was Rose being revealed to Alisha during the ending of the series... A part of me, a fan of both Rose and Alisha, really enjoyed that reveal as it allowed a growth in their relationship that I thought was pretty nice. It also gave the two a lot more depth, something that both of them sorely needed in the game. But it also made Rose seem somewhat dumb as in the game Rose already knows the real corruption is Bartlow and not Alisha. It's a hard change in which I'm not sure I like or not. \\n\\n\r\nAnother change I DID like was Alisha's heavy involvement in this series. I am a huge fan of Alisha, even if she felt very bland and far away in the actual game. It was nice to see her conflict and what makes her the woman we see in the game - just too bad that they couldn't have done that in the game as well because Alisha's journey was enjoyable to watch. It made up for a lot of other crappiness that was scattered throughout, that's for sure. \\n\\n\r\nSorey is a very likeable character, but just like the game, he is shadowed by the companions he travels with. Lailah, Mikleo, Edna and Zaveid are arguably the most interesting characters that are full of rich history of their own, and yes Sorey is too, but it just doesn't interest me. It's like, I like the universe in SPITE of Sorey rather than because of him. Yeah his good and pure and he struggles with himself sometimes but I just don't care? I feel a lot more invested in the others than him and it makes it hard watching sometimes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the animation was the real winner of this. Ufotable have always done a good job and they did a fantastic one with Zestiria the X. Everyone and everything looks superbly done and animated and even if certain characters and the story aren't the best, the anime is at the very least pretty to look at.\\n\\n\r\nSo while I scored it a 7, I wouldn't watch it unless you're a big fan of the Tales series or if you just want to stare at some pretty anime people for a while.",

Characters dont have much deep, conversations are unnatural, no humor. Insert music doesnt match the atmosphere at all, especially fighting scenes. After the first half it becomes so so boring, its not funny, not sad, not scary, not intensive... feels like I'm watching a bunch of cutscenes from the game, not an actual anime. So my advice is make such you have a high quality version of this anime, a big screen, grabthe porcorn, relax and enjoy the art, the graphic, the cg, the animation.",

The art is absolutely amazing, for sure one of the best by far. The only thing that bothered me was how the story progressed. The protagonist seemed to change far too fast to the point where I can barely recognize him to the protagonist I've been introduced to in the beginning of the story. For sure this anime is a masterpiece to some and I'm very sure it was extremely expensive tomake, but the story had a hard time keeping up with it all in my opinion. I really wished that I could have enjoyed it as much as those who had prior viewer experience with this particular studio, but because of the fact that I do not, it was very difficult for me to enjoy it.",

            "content": "Why the name Zestiria?, because it's the Passion that \"Zest\" Lighting the World of RPG's. YUP that sums it up perfectly.\r\nMild Spoilers Ahead\r\nTales of Zestiria the X is an anime adaptation of the video anime with the same name and done by ufotable no less and follows Sorey voiced by Ryohei Kimura a human able to see seraphim, a kind of spiritual beings taken human form, until one day him and his seraphim friend Mikleo voiced by Ryota Osaka stumbles upon a human named Alisha Diphda voiced by Ai Kayano, treats her wounds but Sorey and Mikelo gets embroiled in a huge incident once theyventure out into the human world and Sorey in named the Shepherd, the saviour to purify the hellions of the world so that Sorey can reach his dream of both humans and seraphim able to live together.\\n\\n\r\nLA will say this as a person who has never touched a Tales game and this is LA's diving board into the franchise through Tales of Zestiria the X and through LA watching the anime, LA gets the basic gist of what a Tales game entails at the very least and the anime is easily digestible especially with how theatrical everything looks thanks to ufotable. But LA has the good and the bad, let's start with the good.\\n\\n\r\nWell again, the animation done by ufotable makes everything look like an action packed movie quality and with how crisp, fluid and just how polished and detailed everything looks was awe inspiring to say the least and even better when it comes to the battles and choreography of the anime, it just blows LA's mind how consistent ufotable's animation standard is and this for a video game adaptation no less, character designs, background work, battle and choreography were all done to the ufotable standard and once again ufotable KNOWS how to incorporate CGI excellently to enhance the action not make it more noticeable. Tales of Zestiria the X's plot though at first seems simple, like the chosen one aka. Sorey meant to be the savior of the world he's in, gathering party members and defeating the big bad, but where the anime is interesting with it's plot and characters are with in the details, like how Alisha is fiercely loyal to her beliefs of not wanting war even for her to be semi-pacifist nature as a result, but the thought of war even having ramifications to the supernatural, as in the birth of hellions as a result, so literally Alisha's beliefs is the manifestation and her want of not wanting war means she in turn follows the path Sorey goes through, defeating hellions. This in turn, makes the world building actually VERY good, we know in great detail the lore of the world, the political struggles Alisha has to go through and how all of this affects the hellion crisis and we get to see how hellions work and functions. If anything Tales of Zestiria the X's best strength in it's plot is it's world building, fleshing out the world to not only interweave it's multiple plotlines but it's characters too, while subtlety adding lore to the world as well. Tales of Zestiria the X's character chemistry isn't that bad either as even though there are characters personality that are plentiful and clash at times, the motley crew that Sorey has gathered is decent, LA's favorite characters being Alisha from the human side, as she's not only badass but how pure her beliefs of wanting to stop the war by any means is and Edna voiced by Misato Fukuen, an earth seraphim, who's a bit of a deadpan snarker. Finally well, the voice work throughout the entire anime was AMAZING, from Ai Kayano, Misato Fukuen, Ryohei Kimura, Ryota Osaka, Mikako Komatsu, Noriko Shitaya and Rina Sato was all amazing, LA can't say much but sing the praises of this voice cast. LA REALLY liked this voice cast.\\n\\n\r\nRight so Tales of Zestiria the X isn't perfect, as much as LA wanted it to be but hey everything can't be perfect.\\n\\n\r\nSo the anime for one has some pacing issues and LA really does mean this, as the anime, well the first season of this anyways, is essentially getting our setting and characters setup and everything sure, but the anime is at first slow, then it almost felt like it rushed the \"gathering party members' part as we get like an introduction episode for each of the party members in quick succession, it just kinda spun LA for a loop was all and because of this, trying to get invested in the expanded party becomes HARD to say the least, the only reason Edna got into LA's favorites was because she had at least a bit of development through her episode and her goal anyways appears at the same time unlike say Zaveid voiced by Kenjirou Tsuda. These problems also kinda hinders the anime as a whole all due to Velvet Crowe voiced by Rina Sato, a character from Tales of Berseria who gets her own three episode arc shoved quite early on and we, well LA at least, has NO IDEA what her story is connected to Sorey and Alisha is and remember LA didn't play the games so LA is completely in the dark for all this, all LA wanted from Velvet Crowe's side plotline was a bit of clarity to how her story was connected was all and here's the thing, LA LIKES Velvet Crowe as a character, being quite the opposite to Sorey in almost every single way, Sorey is a human wanting peace between both humans and seraphim by killing hellions, while Velvet is out for revenge against Artorius, the man who killed her little brother for the sake of the world and has a demon hand that EATS other hellions. The last flaw LA will say is that yeah..as much as the entire main cast's backstory and the plot at large has, what with war and hellions being involved, the character department, mainly in the personality department is rather lacking, expected from an anime adapting what is classic RPG formula. Sorey is always the budding main protagonist who fights for justice, Alisha is the badass pure princess..well the \"Zestiria\" in the title makes alot more sense with Sorey and Alisha at least, Mikleo is the best friend, Laliah is the calm, voice of reason character, Edna the aforementioned deadpan snarker and all the Hyland higher ups are all assholes *cough* typical *cough*, and of course the Lord of Calamity is obviously the Big Bad of the entire anime.\\n\\n\r\nNow as much as Tales of Zestiria the X has some outweighed negatives compared to the positives LA layed out, LA still liked the anime overall, ufotable's animation is the expected high quality is gives out, the great world building element to it and it's good character chemistry.  Yes Tales of Zestiria the X has it's problems but LA can look past that and LA can see potential in this anime and this being it's first season. Tales of Zestiria the X is a fine video to anime adaptation akin for LA at least to another of ufotable's work, God Eater's adaptation right down it's strengths and flaws it had. LA can see  Tales of Zestiria the X doing more or at least learn from it's flaws. It's first season is essentially Sorey getting his party together, hope it's second season gets to it's big climax and maybe defeat the big bad?. LA is hoping.\\n\\n\r\nTales of Zestiria the X needs more Vitamin C, not enough ZEST.",

            "content": "The first thing that strikes me about Tales of Zestiria is the pure beauty of it.  The animation is top flight from start to finish.  The use of CG makes for breathtaking battle scenes and animation, and the character design was very, very cool.  Especially, when it came to Lailah and Velvet Crowe.  \r\nI really have to point out the excellence of the fight scenes, especially when it came to hand-to-hand combat.  While there are a lot of bombastic, big fights in this anime, I was most entertained by the simpler sword fights, because of their fluid animation style.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond this, the characters were likable, but a little two-dimensional.  There wasn't a whole lot of depth to the cast.  They were basically just like RPG characters (this is based off of a game) and their primary motivations pretty much determined their every thought, action and interaction.  But, in spite of this, there were two characters that stood out the most to me, one was Elisha Diptha and the other was Velvet Crowe.  Elisha was an awesome character.  Strong, fierce, intelligent, and a heck of a fighter, she was far from your typical \"princess in need of help\" that usually just relies on the MC to help her reach her goals.  Velvet Crowe hardly got any time, just about two episodes that seemed oddly disjointed, but were entertaining nonetheless, was another character who made an impression quickly.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, though, the series was hampered by the end, which was really more of a perfunctory bridge to the next season.  When it seemed like some real stakes were on the table, ultimately they were pulled or reversed at the end.  Disappointing.  \\n\\n\r\nTales of Zestiria the X isn't rewriting the book on fantasy genre anime, it's pretty by the numbers, with a little twist of exorcists mixed in.  It's your standard \"save the world from dark forces anime\", but it's above average in because of its beauty and action, and for me, personally, Elisha.   I wish she was the MC instead of Sorey, who was likable, but Elisha was more intriguing.  \\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nOverall: 8",

            "content": "TALES OF ZESTIRIA THE X SEASON 1 ANIME REVIEW\r\nWARNING: SPOILER\r\nOVERALL: 10/10\r\nPLOT: 10/10\r\nOne of the most intriguing topic is human nature, for me. Thus, this anime series is unexpectedly good. I thought this will only consist of a normal adventure-action anime tag along with a loli character, a bishounen, you get what my point is. But it is perfect. It has a great combination of reality and fantasy. It contains of deeper views of human emotions, how they think, how they react, how fragile they can be. How a simple misunderstanding can lead to such agony and pain. How weak humans are when it comes totheir feelings, their greed which is making the decisions for them. That very thing, that weakness, is what this anime makes into reality. How it can change the world, and can destroy the human itself. This series is interesting. I think it was first release as a game, though I still haven't try it.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nGirl characters in an adventure anime is very rare. It became a norm that once a girl takes a role in such genre, they must be protected and looked into. But this series breaks it. No girl needs attention. No girl needs protection. Sometimes, it is great to see a main character who decides for what she really wants with head held high, a brave spirit which make others follow her. Not that Alisha (Heroine) is the only interesting character in the series. It is all, actually. All of them have that strong spirit in them which allow them to step forward even there are struggles ahead. Well, who said there needs to be a weak ones in a story always? Some of them needs development, yes. It is to grow, to make them more real. But it is not a disadvantage. It is what makes them human.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION AND SOUND: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThere's no doubt that the animation of this series is great. Every emotion is well expressed and every characters animation is close to perfect. The action scenes are also suspenseful and every bit of it looks way too cool. In line with the songs, I don't know but I've always have a goosebumps watching it. It feels like the song is perfectly match up on the animation of it. The way the characters action in that certain song is really awesome it gives me goosebumps.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nIf it is enjoyment, there's no way I deny it. Though I've taken too much time to finished this since there not much time, every episode is worth the watch. I forgot how many screenshots I've made for this one. It is not heartwarmimg or anything like that, if described, it is more like an eye opener if it was watched thoroughly.\\n\\n\r\nENDING: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI don't know if I'm just overreacting rating this anime as perfect, but it is for me. Though I know that there are questions that been kept hanging at the end of this season 1, I think that it has ended satisfyingly. It is not your normal ending in any action anime, as well as it is also not that overly done. It is quite simple, yet, you will know it is not the end. It can easily be accepted and you will crave for more.",

So I\u2019ll probably never re-watch it but it wasn\u2019t a complete loss of time.\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\r\nI think since it wasn\u2019t too bad I would rather give it a 6. I probably wouldn\u2019t recommend it to my friends though. I hope season 2 will clear up things a little.\\n",

I looked at the artwork and reminded me of King Arthur (who'd guess that?)...\r\nSo when I decided to watch the 2014, 45 minute special, then the series to see if I were interested. Let's say I was hooked. \r\nThe story is a bit interesting with the fact of Seraphs and their contribution to the world until the end. If you're a fantasy person, love action, fluid CG, this is your show. The lore is so enriching in my opinion.\r\nA great show to watch in one sitting. Bothseasons are worth your while. Some characters have great relationships, but some missed opportunities. Sound is the redeeming factor, playing small background music during drama jam packed scenes adds to the intensity and impact. An amazing show in my opinion.",

            "content": "I have very mixed feeling about this anime, so this is kinda hard to write. On one side, it has stunning visual and a great accurate medieval vibe with a complex background of a war story between two kingdoms. On the other side, what is actually going on with this anime, a story about a kid with his friends who try to \"exorcise\" other stuff that have been corrupted is boring AF. Story is very one sided, I can't feel any chemistry between characters and the fighting scenes are forgettable.\r\nWhat's great: The animation is top class. On top 3 anime from a visual perspective. Thewestern europe medieval time is also really nice and accurate and I enjoy it when a anime can put out an accurate description.\\n\\n\r\nSCORE\\n\r\n1. why not higher? I just can't. This is already a pretty far stretched score for this anime. It has nothing memorable, nothing special, nothing u haven't seen already done better in some other anime.\\n\\n\r\n2. why not lower? The only reason it's not a 7 or lower is because of the absolutely amazing visuals. I literally gave this anime a point for the amazing visuals. If it weren't for those, this would be like a 6.5 anime.\\n\\n\r\nNOTES: If u are like me, who hates one sided story and repetitive episodes, u should not bother. The graphics are really good but I don't know if it's worth it.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Story: I give it a four.  The plot bunny was decent and had the potential to be decent.  \r\nArt: I give it an 8  The characters were drawn well and the animation was smooth.   The only bad things about the art were the dragons that looked awkward.  This and the sound is the best part of the entire Anime.  \r\nSound: I give it an 8.  The opening/ending songs were great, and the music during the anime was also great.  \r\nIt actually sucks that the art and sound were wasted on this anime, because the characters draggedit down.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: They were all horrible and dragged it down.  \\n\r\n- The main guy is the stereotypical \"I have hope that everything will work out!  I will purify mankind and there will be peace!\"  \\n\r\n- Main guy's friend: just supports and serves him like a butler\\n\r\n- Main girl: Easily the worst character of the entire anime.  Nothing salvageable about her.  She didn't care about the people because she was willing to let a disease spread in order to have a festival, yet she all of a sudden cared and didn't want war.  She was optimistic and peaceful, yet wanted to go to battle.  I just can't...\\n\r\n- Other Seraphim/women: they all acted the same and they all had that weird hope/optimism\\n\\n\r\nThe logical and cynical characters were not taken seriously.  If you expect diversity of personalities and logic, then skip this one.  Most of the girls acted the same and had the same goal.  It was annoying and frustrating.  They didn't even get the elements right either. Why was fire feminine, healing, caring, and going with the flow?  That's water!  Why was water more masculine, logical, and detached?  That's air!  Why was earth masculine acting (she's a girl), hopeful, optimistic, and passionate?  That's fire!\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this was not a fun anime and it dragged at points.  Logic had no place in this anime, which you kind of need.  You need a diversity of characters to make it interesting.  It also left questions and dumb people.\\n\\n\r\nWhy did the main girl and guy think they could solve all the problems by beating one thing?  They do know that with humans, exist malevolence right?  Human nature and the deadly sins go hand in hand.  You'll always have someone that's greedy, lustful, jealous, prideful, apathetic, angry, and gluttonous.  They all play off of each other and different levels.  \\n\\n\r\nWhy were the round table people bad?  What proof did the main girl have to think they were bad?  Literally, the only proof we had: he disagreed with her several times and he's an ugly old man.  THAT'S our proof.  I'm done...\\n\\n\r\nWhy do people think she's such a great person who's willing to sacrifice herself, when she didn't even want to get rid of the festival in order to take care of a pandemic?  \\n\\n\r\n\"A pandemic is spreading and y'all want to deal with it?  Y'all are obviously evil people who want to take away my comfort?!\"  *A few episodes later*  \"I'll do anything to save the people I care about!\"  *several episodes later*  \"They want me to take care of sick people?  They are obviously planning something evil!  No matter, I like helping people anyway!\"  *an episode later* \"I can't deal with all these sick people!\"  \\n\\n\r\n\"I'll be the first to die on the battlefield!\"  *at war and people die before her*  \"We have to be peaceful and avoid bloodshed!\"  *Same episode and the bodyguard kills five people right in front of her*",

            "content": "When I first watched this it showed promise, but then it quickly devolved into the same old \"hero of justice\" trope fan-fare, but less epic when you really think about it. \r\nStory - [2]\r\nThe story is about how humanity is cursed by evil emotions that give life to hellions, monsters that humans can't perceive, but can feel and witness as natural or un-natural disasters. Sorey is the boy who is chosen to purify these hellions (that humans can't see). So he is fighting some invisible monster to the typical person and that would look very dumb.... \r\nThe anime also have plot holes in how malevolencecan turn people into monsters. When does it happen, how does it happen? There are prisoners that are surely tortured, criminals that are rotting in jail cells. They all have anguish and malevolence, but they don't turn into monsters (hellions)? This is never adequately explained. \\n\\n\r\nI also wonder when the seraphs drink or eat do bystanders see only those things, those objects moving? Also what happens if a seraph actually touches a human? This is never touched upon and the whole interaction is very awkward. \\n\\n\r\nThe whole premise was to eliminate malevolence, but without badness there is no standard by which you can judge goodness. Even heaven itself has not solved this problem as there are fallen angels. This is a dilemma of the plot and story. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt - [10]\\n\\n\r\nWe all know the power house that is Ufotable. The artwork is vibrant as it is fluid. Everything looks good. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound - [6]\\n\\n\r\nMost of the music works for most of the situations. Haven't heard a mis-placed track anywhere. Its good enough. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters - [4]\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all pretty generic. We have the sheltered chosen one that plays the hero of justice, his friend who explains the world a bit. Then we have all the other characters that just serve as power ups for the Shepard for the most part.",

Let's get started with the review!\r\nStory:-8/10\r\ni Give it an 8 because this story might not be fully original, nothing is these days, but minus that it a very interesting plot about malevolence and purifying and what not. So yes the story is an awesome action adventure plot. Pretty simple.\r\nArt:-10/10\r\nThe Art Was Just Mind-blowing!!!It was so freaking AWESOME!!!  Like seriously most of the time i wondered if they used pictures for the backgrounds. The sky the water, especiallythe water, and places, everything was just too good. The characters themselves looked awesome. All good looking and well drawn and the costumes were just great. MINOR SPOILER AHEAD!- The dragon was just AMAZING!!!!!\\n\\n\r\nSound-10/10\\n\r\nI watched the dubbed version and it was really good. The voices fit the characters and their personalities perfectly. The sound effects were just...AMAZING! (lol) It made me love the anime more. Oh and the music was very nice and appropriate for the anime. The sound itself makes the anime worth watching.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:-9/10\\n\r\nI have never liked this many characters from one anime in my entire life! All the characters r like-able with great personalities and looks. My personal favorites are eizen, mikleo, and lailah, but i loved alisha and the others too. I just wasn't a huge fan of edna. But never-mind that, the characters were all badass and had depth in their characters unlike a lot of characters in other anime. So yeah no complaint there.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:-9/10\\n\r\ni honestly enjoyed this anime a lot. It was very cool. The fight scenes especially put me on the edge of my seat. They were EPIC!!! If u love action and adventure like me u will love this anime. Just a couple of tweaks here and there could have made it better and i would have  given it a 10. But nonetheless i loved it!\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:-9/10\\n\r\nI  give it a 9 overall. The awesome art, characters, plot, sound, everything was awesome. If only the story was a tiny bit better or original it would have been a perfect anime. Think of this as a mix of FMAB and HXH.....EPIC RIGHT!?!? I really recommend u watch this anime. Everyone should give it a try, \\n\r\nSTAY SAFE AND WATCH GOOD ANIME...PEACE!!!",
