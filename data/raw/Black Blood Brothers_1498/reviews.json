            "content": "Story:\r\nEven though I'm not a great vampire genre fan I liked the story of this anime. It has a nice build-up without leaving you guessing too much. The smooth development of the story and the nice cliffhangers keep you interested and because of there are only 12 episodes it's an easy to watch show. 9/10\r\nAnimation:\r\nThe animation style of Black Blood Brothers is a kind of cartoonish, but that really fits the story. This only goes for the shape of the characters, because there movements are fluent and mature. Especially the fights are done very nicely and makes you wanting more. In contrast to most vampireseries, the animation of this show is pretty bright, which gives it a less serious look.\\n\r\nI give the animation 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe OP is &quot;Ashita no Kioku&quot; by Naozumi Takahashi. It's a nice J-rock song which just rocks.\\n\r\nThe ED is &quot;Shinkirou&quot; by LOVEHOLIC and is a typical J-pop ED.\\n\r\nI liked the way the special FX were done in this series. The sounds were very realistic, like the clashing of the swords and the gunfire. Also does the background music fit the action. Because of that you almost don't notice it. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe development of the characters is done very well in only 12 episodes. They also have many different sides. The series is pretty serious, but they managed to put in some funny remarks which makes the show not too heavy. Especially the main character Jirou has some funny one liners every now and then. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThis is a short, action-packed, funny vampire series. I really loved watching this show and I hope there will be a second season. This all depends on the DVD sales, so when they are released, please buy them. Since this show only has 12 episodes you don't need to spend a fortune on just these few DVD's.\\n\r\nIf you like an easy to follow story, action and vampires, this is definitely a show for you! I give Black Blood Brothers an overall score of 9/10.",

            "content": "Story:\r\nIt's a story that does indeed focus on a vampire, however the story makes it so that it doesn't revolve around the vampireness, because it really focuses on Jirou, the main character, going up against the Kowloon Children. The background story is revealed in small tidbits at the beginning of each episode, and is rather enigmatic at the start, however unveils as you progress over the episodes and is completely revealed on the final episode. The story itself really is kinda crappy, however the fact that they managed to fully pack the story and it's background story into just 12 episodes is somewhat notable Isuppose.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe artwork is pretty well executed. The fight scenes are fluently animated. Contrary to most vampire genre series, the overall color to the art isn't very dark and shady, providing it with a little more lighthearted feel and mood, however still becoming serious when necessary.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe OP is a pretty cool JRock song that definitely suits the series. Good choice for this one. The ED then switches to a light and more melodic tune, giving it a nice contrast. The sound effects work well, and the background music also fits the scenes nicely.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nWell, lemme just start off saying that the main character and vampire, Jirou, has really just a cliche vampire look. Long black hair and red garb, particularly consisting of a long trench coat (hmm...sound like Alucard.) But then there's his brother, Kotarou, who has an appearance that is pretty much the farthest thing from vampire looking.\\n\r\nI'd really like to note though how much I dislike the fact that Jirou seems basically invincible and can defeat anyone with little to no effort, with the exception of the final battle. I don't really like seeing that in a show, despite how much I like action and shounen series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThe story is bearable, the art and sound's fine, the characters are fair, but for some reason, I really didn't find it very enjoyable. It lacked the elements to continuously draw me in and make me want to keep watching. Why? Well, the fights were mostly pretty curt, and as I've said, they weren't that entertaining because Jirou basically kicked too much ass in several short seconds, with the exception of the final match. I believe it was also devoid of the suspenseful attributes that most vampire series usually succeed in. Honestly, if it continued past 12 episodes, it probably would have become incredibly boring. Overall, I do feel it is a decent show for a quick 12 episode short series.",

            "content": "At the beginning of this anime I didn't really get the story due some events that weren't explained properly. It took out a bit of the joy and even made me consider the drop out on this one. However.. after a couple of episodes I finally started to understand the story. I was able to connect the relations between the characters and DAMN I have to say, this was one well out thought anime!\r\nAfter having seen all the episodes it made me realize 1 thing, I want more!\r\nThe art of this anime reminds me kinda of some \"classic\" animes. In my opinion it told methat it had a great story hidden inside. Just looking at the art alone can make one tell that there has been a lots of thought and devotion to it.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is pretty good, however I don't judge much to the sound. Overall conversations were very clear, special effects weren't to loud or exaggerated. It suited the scene in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters may see a bit vague in the begin, because there isn't an introduction about them. Rather you willl get to know those characters through flash backs/memories in each episode for about 3-5 minutes. I found it a bit annoying in the begin to be honest, however after finishing it I really have nothing to complain about. The flash backs and the current time get together perfectly. With this the characters, from which some have a noticable background, will be properly explain.\\n\\n\r\nI overall enjoyed this anime a lot! I am eager for more from this series! This is one of the few with a great story that isn't boring. In my opinion they had enough stuff left for a season 2, however looking at the date of its last released episode it sadly won't happen. Still this anime is worth watching! Maybe more than once ;).",

            "content": "This anime is as mediocre as it looks, the plot summary I read on Wikipedia was more interesting than the actual series.\r\nStory: 5/10\r\nThe story was okay. It's not as interesting as the description of the series would make it to be. It had alot of history mentioned in the plot but who cares when it was basically about a vampire who is an old war hero moving his brother to a new place so he could experience friendship. They could have put the history in the scenes if it was really all that important, therefore the 12 episodes would have been worth it. This couldhave easily been an ova/ona series. It wasn't really any need to drag it out to 12 episodes. I wouldn't say the pace was slow (for me anyways) but it was dragged out. It reminded me of the series 2005's Guyver they could have easily been less than 26 episodes. There were no fillers or side stories in Black Blood Brothers. It did have flashbacks to Kotarou and Jirou spending time to get when Kotaruo was a female. The conclusion was good mostly because I was happy it was ending. It hinted at continuation of the story but it didn't end badly to where there were big questions unanswered.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I liked about this series:\\n\\n\r\nWhat I liked about this series is the comedy and not in the way you think. On the anime data news base sites that I have seen they have this series in the genre of comedy. Which I find it was dry on comedy. What I did find funny is that if he wanted to protect his brother wouldn't it have been smart if he DIDN'T wear a rich red suit with a funny looking wizard hat to match? Wouldn't that make him...STICK OUT?!! lol (Interesting note about Jirou's costume is that it looks like a Hellsing ripoff.)\\n\\n\r\nSomething else I found hilarious was in episode 5. When Jirou mentions that he could tell Mimiko was a virgin she becomes embarrassed and pushes Jirou on the street with little Kotarou on his back. Trying to dodge Mimiko's kicks, Jirou then rolls on the floor laughing squishing Kotarou who is still on his back. IThe person who was watching this series with me and I started laughing frantically. I had to pause the episode to get all my laughing out.While Jirou was laughing trying to dodge Mimiko's kicks didn't he realize he was steam rolling his little brother that was on his back? (lol) So in short, I liked the series because it was so lame that I could get a good laugh off of it.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art in the series was weak. It had nice see through curtains in the first episode. Contained the goodies like hair shine, eye freckles, nice water detail (in one scene though the rest of the water detail was okay) and light/sun beams but it was still lacking over all. Although I'm a big fan of red the color scheme was average at best.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nI watched the english dubbed version on netflix so the sound review is for english dubbed. The voices were lifeless and borderline boring which is one of the biggest reasons why I don't like to watch dubbed anime because they usually fail to bring any personality to the table.\\n\\n\r\nThe beginning song is a big pass. It was attempt of rock that I didn't appreciate. The background music could have been better but it wasn't annoying. The end song, I actually liked. I wouldn't run out and buy it, but it is a highlight of the series but that may be because it's an end of me wasting my time....lol.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters introduced played their part but none of them made me interested in learning more about them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nIt wasn't unbearable but if they would have dragged it longer than 12 episodes I would be writing a suicide note....lol\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nIt all averages out to 5/10 and I would add it's mediocre at best.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend to someone else? I would have to think about that. If someone thought the animes I think are lame were cool and they were into vampire stories than I would recommend this to them other than that I wouldn't recommend it. The story summaries on the anime news databases is about as deep as it goes.",

            "content": "It would be ill adviced if I did not warn you ahead that the sound area is going to get pretty ugly, but you've been warned.\r\nI didn't really want to try Black Blood Brothers after the horrid rech of a series Twilight had come out and was ruining the name of vampires, so I was a little untrusting of this series. But after seeing an amv for Within Temptation on this series I decided why not when I find the time. I found that time yesterday. \r\nThe plot was descent enough, had some flaws, but it was descent. It sort of reminded me a littleof Shinzo at first, the journey to paradise, then it jumped ship to a reminder of Saiyuki. Hm.. Well I will say this that the prologue at the beginning of the series wasn't really necessary. And many scenes had made me sidetrack to my own mind but quickly snap me back to the series at hand. I will not lie, it was pretty un-impressive at the start but got better along the way. For a short series it did have a slight fast pace plot, and quickly ran to the their destination by the end of the first dvd. I wish it were longer but in all honesty not so much. 'sighs' As I said the plot was descent enough, just as the summary discribs, but also it has its... what do you call them.. boring features to it. \\n\\n\r\nThe art work was pretty fair game here. But I could not ignore the long faces, the two scrawny stomachs, and oh yes.. a plump looking Kontorou (he may be little but I doubt he is that plump). Some of the hair styles could have also been better, but it was pretty good and I enjoyed it somewhat. The background wasn't too dull nor was it to bright like some anime like to give it a cheery sort of feel, so yes. It was pretty fair with some faults to it.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound now.. (This is me cursing the dub out.. you have been warned twice). \\n\\n\r\nI hated it.. The moment I heard Kontorous voice I knew offically that FUNimation once again messed up the voice cast. Urgh.. I had to stop the disk the first few minutes after it really started just to gain my nerve to watch it. And I must say I almost regret it. Tantum J. Michael... Jiro voice.. How many times am I going to have to say that this idiot was just too dull.. I swear they chose him because some fangirls commented his voice sounds sexy.. Sex appeal for a character isn't enough. 'sighs' It was gruff, it was a little off, and even when he did a suppose to be hilarious face, I could not laught because I could hear the dullness behind the panic. Really.. he did not match with the character, and I once again am reminded that this was to be the voice of Sebastian Michaelis. Disappointing. Kontorou, was just horrid. So wincy and scratchy and overly loud.. ouch my ears. Mimiko.. wasn't to bad but the voice didn't match the character well. 'sighs' I feel bad for the anime.. and any other anime that FUNimation got a hold of.. they may get a large amount of anime but I must say their voice casting skills suck to the bone. (In other words the english dub was just horrible.)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters now... Well as I said the sound messed with this opinion here. I barely could pay attention to busy with trying not to strangle whoever was in charge of picking the voice cast. Jiro, threw the dullness and the hint of gruffness I found that he was a pretty stubborn and strict character with a gentel side to him, the voice really really could have been better for him to show this but unfortunately you need to watch what he does to get him. Saddening but true. He was a pretty descent character and I liked him, but his reasons for protecting Kontorou so strongly are rather see threw.\\n\\n\r\nKontorou now.. I just had to ignore him.. I could bring myself to pay attention to him because of how bad the voice was. I can give you what I know though.. he is hyper and gets into trouble alot. Yeah.. no different from a normal child, but I just couldn't pay any attention him other than that.\\n\\n\r\nMimiko was.. innoscent with a short temper. Her voice as I said wasn't too bad, but I found when she yelled I had to tune her out. She felt a bit sueish if you know what I mean, for two shows now it consentrated a little too much on her, so I have a small fear that she might end up like Bella from Twilight. Not good, not good at all.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the characters I forget now reason why they weren't really strong enough to gain my attention. 'sighs' I am not really looking forward to the next episodes, don't get me wrong the plot was descent, art was fair as was the characters, but the sound I am not. 'sighs' I will make sure to put it on subs next time though.\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment of this was a five. The voice cast just continued to lower my enjoyment so I really couldn't get into it, but I did enjoy watching Jiro beat up his little brother and Mimiko yell at Jiro. The humor was funny (with the exception of Jiro's moments.) but my enjoyment was pretty low.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give this a six. I can't give it a 5.3 like I want to but if you try to round five off you'll get a five so I will leave it with a mediocre rating. I didn't enjoy it is so much, the plot was descent, and art was fair, but be warned those who attempt the dub.. it was bad. Characters were all right to but not completely. There are more better vampire series than this to be honest.",

            "content": "I really did like the show, though I found it a bit hard to pick out what was happening now and happening back during the attack on Hong Kong because of some of the flash backs. Kotaro is a really cute and funny character, always getting into trouble and is a good contrast to his very old sounding brother, Jiro. It\u2019s nice that they had kept a version of the real vampire myths. They kept the *cough* feelings that happen when a vampire bites another, and some of the stuff about their weaknesses and such. The play between a couple of people is rather funincluding the strange Rinsuke Akai who seems to be rather flamboyant. He had no reason being there except for to be a yaoi fan girls dream.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is rather nice and fluid though we have one of the same problems as other shoes where we get the stupid motion lines. It\u2019s supposed to make it seem rather fast but it just feels cheesy most of the time. There are a lot of times that it does look cheaply made and characters look out of proportion, but I still like the show when it doesn\u2019t. I like how they change to a sort of grayer tone for when they show a flashback though I don\u2019t understand why they don\u2019t do it to the flashbacks of the Kowloon War.\\n\\n\r\nThe voices in the English dub are actually pretty fitting to the characters and not to off-putting. One of the problems I had was when some of the other characters were brought in. Their voices would ether be to low for me to hear and when I turned it up, the loud voices and music hurt my ears. The music has a pretty nice pop art sound to it and then it was balanced with a little bit of the piano music, and I never had trouble with it overpowering the scenes. Most fit pretty well though they did have some of side-walk walking music that made some characters fun.\\n",

            "content": "This is one of those shows which just had potential for more.\r\nUnfortunately, it failed in almost everything it tried to do.\r\nWhat a wasted opportunity.\r\nSTORY[6]:\r\n-> So generic it hurts. Story follows ex-vampire killer(vampire himself), a hero of a war which is shown in first episode and his attempts to protect his little brother, all that while dealing with various bits from his past. While it had a lot of potential because it was presented somewhat in a new way, it failed miserably due to the fact many things are just not explained. I dunno if there's manga which is supposed to be read before/after watching theshow, but from anime only point of view, too many things are not explained during this 12 episodes.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART[6]:\\n\r\n-> I wouldn't call art bad. Some effects are flashy and fights sometimes look good. However, most of the fights are just soldiers shooting at empty space with like thousands of bullets while vampires cut them down. The, how I like to call it, \"atmosphere art\" (trees, sky, etc.), is done really bad. And this is a big shame. Show has a lot of scenes in nature or on the river, and the scenery is just...bland. It just isn't \"alive\".\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND[7]:\\n\r\n-> OP song is really good. Unlike soundtrack, which is rather bad for a show with many emotional scenes, voice acting is done superbly. It's really easy to recognize characters by their voice, and emotions exist when they are talking. Too bad soundtrack doesn't follow.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER[6]:\\n\r\n-> I feel bad for giving this one a 6. But the fact is, this show maybe doesn't even deserve that much. Characters start off strong. Main character, Jirou, is presented as super-strong, but caring and gentle person. And while he's explained a lot in the beginning, any character development is nonexistent later on. Many characters just aren't developed at all. Cassa, probably main villain, but the way she acted, more of a nuisance than a villain, is completely forgotten when it comes to character development. This is category which could have been pure 10, but since the show is only 12 episodes and it rushed through many dialogs, it simply failed to deliver any real development, not only for secondary, but for main characters as well.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT[6]:\\n\r\n-> As always, this category won't be explained too much. I did enjoy it, especially first few episodes, but it just has too many flaws to really love it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL[6]:\\n\r\n->Just a 6 for a really good show. It really, really, really should have been 24 episodes long. Too many things unanswered, too many characters un(der)developed/unexplained, too many things rushed. A real shame.\\n\r\nI'll be honest, I did hope to find out there is season 2, but there isn't.\\n\r\nIt may be great manga(if there's one), but as anime, it failed.\\n\r\nPitty.",

            "content": "I don\u2019t know if you notice lately or before but there was been a numerous amount of anime with vampires in the main element. Much like movies in the past, present and the future, the vampire boom has been around anime ever since the \u201880s (as far as I know) and there were many hits such as Hellsing, Blood: The Last Vampire, Karin, Vampire Hunter D and many others to be named. But I wonder what can be different about this series or different from any vampire media\u2026\u2026well, let\u2019s hope it won\u2019t be like that other vampire franchise but let\u2019s focus on this now.\r\nDuringa war called the Hong Kong Crusade, an Old Blood Black Blood Brothers, Jiro Mochizuki, a.k.a. the Silver Blade (Gint\u014d), fought and defeated the Kowloon king and also most of the Kowloon Children. Ten years later, Jiro heads to Hong Kong with his little brother, Kotaro Mochizuki, in hopes of reaching The Special Zone, a thriving secret city where Vampires live. They soon realize that a plan to infiltrate the Special Zone is being hatched by the Kowloon Children survivors. As they travel to The Special Zone, Jiro encounters enemies from the past and new threats that may endanger the safety of the Special Zone. The abduction of Kotaro, by one of the Kowloon Children, thrusts him even further into the battle.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nMost of the time in the series, they place the story of Jiro and his late lover in the beginning segments before the main plot surfaces onto the screen. It can be confusing for the first few times if that story doesn\u2019t intersect too much with the original focus but it didn\u2019t seem to bother me in the that track time. The pace for the show wasn\u2019t really quick but for an 12-episode series, it didn\u2019t drag out too long and it got to where it needed to be at that time but at the series\u2019 end, it should added at least one more episode to explain some further details but then again it was one of those \u201cyou have to read the manga to find out more\u201d type of show but it\u2019s mostly saying, \u201cRead for once in your life, you lazy fuck!!\u201d.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this series are not as flattering or even noteworthy of being memorable. Jiro plays the archetype of the vampire who still mourns for his lost love and somewhat an unstoppable force to reckon with\u2026\u2026well, not really. Water is his weakness. Yes, we can survive bullets and sometimes the sun since he does be in the daylight but water can really mess him up. Kotaro\u2026\u2026.should I feel bad that the first I see him in the show and he was banging on the coffin and Jiro beat him around, I laughed at that? But, yeah, Kotaro is basically the cheery comic relief of the show and he\u2019s not really helpful in this and the fact he does get kidnapped and put in danger a lot. He just seems more to get in the way of things then actually helping out. Mimiko wasn\u2019t too bad of a character to deal with, although she does chastise Jiro many times in the story. The only other character that actually does contribute to the story is Cassa, once friends with Jiro and his lover, Alice Eve (not the actress) but betrayed him by killing her.  Every other character (like Kelly Wong) gets tossed aside from show altogether, practically not caring whether their story matters at all.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is rather bland and uninteresting. It looks well done with 50% of the fight scenes but there\u2019s nothing more to that. Group TAC & Studio Live, the companies that provided the animation, really don\u2019t have anything else noticeable in their resume, aside assisting other animation studios on their projects but I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re going to have any future projects after this. The music is also surprisingly dull, albeit has a switch of melodic tone from the OP song to the ED song.  The BG music was nothing to expect anything new but average at best.\\n\\n\r\nFINAL VERDICT: It would be clich\u00e9 to say Black Blood Brothers brought nothing interesting or exciting to the table but it holds up to be pretty average in my book. Some parts you\u2019ll find to be remotely watchable and consistent but aside from that, it can be a mess to go through with.  I would say BBB is only good for a one-time watch and that\u2019s it.\\n",

There is an awful lot going on \u2013 a myriad of side stories and back stories that are just not given enough time, it seems there would have easily been enough material to cover 26 episodes rather than the 12 on offer. As such we\u2019re left with a short show with a lot of characters and not enough time is allowed for character development. The end result is a lot of generic-ness. Its a pity because there some really interesting charactershere, notably the Old Blood vampires, and I would have loved to know a bit more about them \u2013 especially their roles during the Holy War. The primary antagonist Casa is never given a clear motive or back story either! So many hints and so little plot resolution = disappointment, but on the upside each episode is very entertaining in its own right. There\u2019s plenty of action and I was never bored, its only on reflection when writing a review that I realised how unfinished the show was. Still a good vampire show to pass the time with.  There is an ending but you get the feeling there should be more \u2013 it\u2019s more like the end of an arc rather than the end of a series.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION: Its fine, does the job. Nice enough character designs (although I hated Jirou\u2019s hat with a passion \u2013 its a crime against fashion!) all rather simple and clean. Vampire powers and fight scenes were well done too \u2013 overall its a fairly average looking show, not bad not brilliant.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC & VOICE ACTING: Music was passable \u2013 didn\u2019t like the OP, quite liked the ED. Voice acting was good though. Takahiro Sakurai (Suzaku \u2013 Code Geass, Kanda - D.Gray-Man) in the main role was great \u2013 Jirou\u2019s personality is quite hot and cold and Sakurai displayed a good range in his voice work.  Jun Fukuyama is in there too providing his \u2018Lelouch\u2019 voice as Zelman - who I really liked.\\n\\n\r\nSo all in all a good entertaining series, even if it feels a bit incomplete.",

The Silver Blade killed the Kowloon King and became known for his skill around the world. After the war ended, about ten years, Jiro leaves the safe, secluded home of the Dark Princess and her older brother Crow to the snowy north to Japan with his younger brother, Kotaro, to live in The Special Zone, a home made for vampires after the Hong Kong Crusade for them to live in peace. But they soon find out that The Special Zone isn't all what its cracked up to be. But before that, Jiro is greeted by a Compromiser, a person who is the &quot;peace-maker,&quot; between the vampires and humans and helps vampires get into the Special Zone as well as finding them a place to stay there.\\n\r\nBehind all this is the main plot, the friend that betrayed Jiro and Alice is planning on getting into the Special Zone as well. And when she arrives she will do whatever she can to get what she wants. The series makes the most of time-hopping through the different phases of the story, a particular artform the Japanese storytellers do well most of the time, but the cuts back and forth in these episodes can lose an unwary watcher along the way every so often.but all in all great anime",

Now give or take but disc 1 is intros and set-up, disc 2 is the build of the story, and disc 3 is the conclusion.  \r\nI watched the first disc and was hooked.  Full out \"gimmie\" mode hanging on release dates keeping all hope for them at the top of the netflix queue.  Disc 2 though sent out the warning flags.  What's going on?  Why are we still introducing characters?More story set up?  What?!  That was all of disc 2?  You mean I have to have the story build and finish in the same disc?  That's a lot to ask of an anime to swing in so few episodes.\\n\\n\r\n... and then came the rush to try to finish.  Generally it left me feeling like this was a big fat promo for the manga which is fine and dandy if it was available to you (perhaps it is now but at the time of viewing...).\\n",

The smooth development of the story and the nice cliffhangers keep you interested and because of there are only 12 episodes it's an easy to watch show. 9/10\r\nAnimation:\r\nThe animation style of Black Blood Brothers is a kind of cartoonish, but that really fits the story. This only goes for the shape of the characters, because there movements are fluent and mature. Especially the fights are done very nicely and makes you wanting more. In contrast to most vampireseries, the animation of this show is pretty bright, which gives it a less serious look.\\n\r\nI give the animation 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe OP is &quot;Ashita no Kioku&quot; by Naozumi Takahashi. It's a nice J-rock song which just rocks.\\n\r\nThe ED is &quot;Shinkirou&quot; by LOVEHOLIC and is a typical J-pop ED.\\n\r\nI liked the way the special FX were done in this series. The sounds were very realistic, like the clashing of the swords and the gunfire. Also does the background music fit the action. Because of that you almost don't notice it. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe development of the characters is done very well in only 12 episodes. They also have many different sides. The series is pretty serious, but they managed to put in some funny remarks which makes the show not too heavy. Especially the main character Jirou has some funny one liners every now and then. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThis is a short, action-packed, funny vampire series. I really loved watching this show and I hope there will be a second season. This all depends on the DVD sales, so when they are released, please buy them. Since this show only has 12 episodes you don't need to spend a fortune on just these few DVD's.\\n\r\nIf you like an easy to follow story, action and vampires, this is definitely a show for you! I give Black Blood Brothers an overall score of 9/10.",

            "content": "Story:\r\nIt's a story that does indeed focus on a vampire, however the story makes it so that it doesn't revolve around the vampireness, because it really focuses on Jirou, the main character, going up against the Kowloon Children. The background story is revealed in small tidbits at the beginning of each episode, and is rather enigmatic at the start, however unveils as you progress over the episodes and is completely revealed on the final episode. The story itself really is kinda crappy, however the fact that they managed to fully pack the story and it's background story into just 12 episodes is somewhat notable Isuppose.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe artwork is pretty well executed. The fight scenes are fluently animated. Contrary to most vampire genre series, the overall color to the art isn't very dark and shady, providing it with a little more lighthearted feel and mood, however still becoming serious when necessary.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe OP is a pretty cool JRock song that definitely suits the series. Good choice for this one. The ED then switches to a light and more melodic tune, giving it a nice contrast. The sound effects work well, and the background music also fits the scenes nicely.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nWell, lemme just start off saying that the main character and vampire, Jirou, has really just a cliche vampire look. Long black hair and red garb, particularly consisting of a long trench coat (hmm...sound like Alucard.) But then there's his brother, Kotarou, who has an appearance that is pretty much the farthest thing from vampire looking.\\n\r\nI'd really like to note though how much I dislike the fact that Jirou seems basically invincible and can defeat anyone with little to no effort, with the exception of the final battle. I don't really like seeing that in a show, despite how much I like action and shounen series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThe story is bearable, the art and sound's fine, the characters are fair, but for some reason, I really didn't find it very enjoyable. It lacked the elements to continuously draw me in and make me want to keep watching. Why? Well, the fights were mostly pretty curt, and as I've said, they weren't that entertaining because Jirou basically kicked too much ass in several short seconds, with the exception of the final match. I believe it was also devoid of the suspenseful attributes that most vampire series usually succeed in. Honestly, if it continued past 12 episodes, it probably would have become incredibly boring. Overall, I do feel it is a decent show for a quick 12 episode short series.",

It took out a bit of the joy and even made me consider the drop out on this one. However.. after a couple of episodes I finally started to understand the story. I was able to connect the relations between the characters and DAMN I have to say, this was one well out thought anime!\r\nAfter having seen all the episodes it made me realize 1 thing, I want more!\r\nThe art of this anime reminds me kinda of some \"classic\" animes. In my opinion it told methat it had a great story hidden inside. Just looking at the art alone can make one tell that there has been a lots of thought and devotion to it.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is pretty good, however I don't judge much to the sound. Overall conversations were very clear, special effects weren't to loud or exaggerated. It suited the scene in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters may see a bit vague in the begin, because there isn't an introduction about them. Rather you willl get to know those characters through flash backs/memories in each episode for about 3-5 minutes. I found it a bit annoying in the begin to be honest, however after finishing it I really have nothing to complain about. The flash backs and the current time get together perfectly. With this the characters, from which some have a noticable background, will be properly explain.\\n\\n\r\nI overall enjoyed this anime a lot! I am eager for more from this series! This is one of the few with a great story that isn't boring. In my opinion they had enough stuff left for a season 2, however looking at the date of its last released episode it sadly won't happen. Still this anime is worth watching! Maybe more than once ;).",

            "content": "This anime is as mediocre as it looks, the plot summary I read on Wikipedia was more interesting than the actual series.\r\nStory: 5/10\r\nThe story was okay. It's not as interesting as the description of the series would make it to be. It had alot of history mentioned in the plot but who cares when it was basically about a vampire who is an old war hero moving his brother to a new place so he could experience friendship. They could have put the history in the scenes if it was really all that important, therefore the 12 episodes would have been worth it. This couldhave easily been an ova/ona series. It wasn't really any need to drag it out to 12 episodes. I wouldn't say the pace was slow (for me anyways) but it was dragged out. It reminded me of the series 2005's Guyver they could have easily been less than 26 episodes. There were no fillers or side stories in Black Blood Brothers. It did have flashbacks to Kotarou and Jirou spending time to get when Kotaruo was a female. The conclusion was good mostly because I was happy it was ending. It hinted at continuation of the story but it didn't end badly to where there were big questions unanswered.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I liked about this series:\\n\\n\r\nWhat I liked about this series is the comedy and not in the way you think. On the anime data news base sites that I have seen they have this series in the genre of comedy. Which I find it was dry on comedy. What I did find funny is that if he wanted to protect his brother wouldn't it have been smart if he DIDN'T wear a rich red suit with a funny looking wizard hat to match? Wouldn't that make him...STICK OUT?!! lol (Interesting note about Jirou's costume is that it looks like a Hellsing ripoff.)\\n\\n\r\nSomething else I found hilarious was in episode 5. When Jirou mentions that he could tell Mimiko was a virgin she becomes embarrassed and pushes Jirou on the street with little Kotarou on his back. Trying to dodge Mimiko's kicks, Jirou then rolls on the floor laughing squishing Kotarou who is still on his back. IThe person who was watching this series with me and I started laughing frantically. I had to pause the episode to get all my laughing out.While Jirou was laughing trying to dodge Mimiko's kicks didn't he realize he was steam rolling his little brother that was on his back? (lol) So in short, I liked the series because it was so lame that I could get a good laugh off of it.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art in the series was weak. It had nice see through curtains in the first episode. Contained the goodies like hair shine, eye freckles, nice water detail (in one scene though the rest of the water detail was okay) and light/sun beams but it was still lacking over all. Although I'm a big fan of red the color scheme was average at best.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nI watched the english dubbed version on netflix so the sound review is for english dubbed. The voices were lifeless and borderline boring which is one of the biggest reasons why I don't like to watch dubbed anime because they usually fail to bring any personality to the table.\\n\\n\r\nThe beginning song is a big pass. It was attempt of rock that I didn't appreciate. The background music could have been better but it wasn't annoying. The end song, I actually liked. I wouldn't run out and buy it, but it is a highlight of the series but that may be because it's an end of me wasting my time....lol.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters introduced played their part but none of them made me interested in learning more about them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nIt wasn't unbearable but if they would have dragged it longer than 12 episodes I would be writing a suicide note....lol\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nIt all averages out to 5/10 and I would add it's mediocre at best.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend to someone else? I would have to think about that. If someone thought the animes I think are lame were cool and they were into vampire stories than I would recommend this to them other than that I wouldn't recommend it. The story summaries on the anime news databases is about as deep as it goes.",

            "content": "It would be ill adviced if I did not warn you ahead that the sound area is going to get pretty ugly, but you've been warned.\r\nI didn't really want to try Black Blood Brothers after the horrid rech of a series Twilight had come out and was ruining the name of vampires, so I was a little untrusting of this series. But after seeing an amv for Within Temptation on this series I decided why not when I find the time. I found that time yesterday. \r\nThe plot was descent enough, had some flaws, but it was descent. It sort of reminded me a littleof Shinzo at first, the journey to paradise, then it jumped ship to a reminder of Saiyuki. Hm.. Well I will say this that the prologue at the beginning of the series wasn't really necessary. And many scenes had made me sidetrack to my own mind but quickly snap me back to the series at hand. I will not lie, it was pretty un-impressive at the start but got better along the way. For a short series it did have a slight fast pace plot, and quickly ran to the their destination by the end of the first dvd. I wish it were longer but in all honesty not so much. 'sighs' As I said the plot was descent enough, just as the summary discribs, but also it has its... what do you call them.. boring features to it. \\n\\n\r\nThe art work was pretty fair game here. But I could not ignore the long faces, the two scrawny stomachs, and oh yes.. a plump looking Kontorou (he may be little but I doubt he is that plump). Some of the hair styles could have also been better, but it was pretty good and I enjoyed it somewhat. The background wasn't too dull nor was it to bright like some anime like to give it a cheery sort of feel, so yes. It was pretty fair with some faults to it.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound now.. (This is me cursing the dub out.. you have been warned twice). \\n\\n\r\nI hated it.. The moment I heard Kontorous voice I knew offically that FUNimation once again messed up the voice cast. Urgh.. I had to stop the disk the first few minutes after it really started just to gain my nerve to watch it. And I must say I almost regret it. Tantum J. Michael... Jiro voice.. How many times am I going to have to say that this idiot was just too dull.. I swear they chose him because some fangirls commented his voice sounds sexy.. Sex appeal for a character isn't enough. 'sighs' It was gruff, it was a little off, and even when he did a suppose to be hilarious face, I could not laught because I could hear the dullness behind the panic. Really.. he did not match with the character, and I once again am reminded that this was to be the voice of Sebastian Michaelis. Disappointing. Kontorou, was just horrid. So wincy and scratchy and overly loud.. ouch my ears. Mimiko.. wasn't to bad but the voice didn't match the character well. 'sighs' I feel bad for the anime.. and any other anime that FUNimation got a hold of.. they may get a large amount of anime but I must say their voice casting skills suck to the bone. (In other words the english dub was just horrible.)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters now... Well as I said the sound messed with this opinion here. I barely could pay attention to busy with trying not to strangle whoever was in charge of picking the voice cast. Jiro, threw the dullness and the hint of gruffness I found that he was a pretty stubborn and strict character with a gentel side to him, the voice really really could have been better for him to show this but unfortunately you need to watch what he does to get him. Saddening but true. He was a pretty descent character and I liked him, but his reasons for protecting Kontorou so strongly are rather see threw.\\n\\n\r\nKontorou now.. I just had to ignore him.. I could bring myself to pay attention to him because of how bad the voice was. I can give you what I know though.. he is hyper and gets into trouble alot. Yeah.. no different from a normal child, but I just couldn't pay any attention him other than that.\\n\\n\r\nMimiko was.. innoscent with a short temper. Her voice as I said wasn't too bad, but I found when she yelled I had to tune her out. She felt a bit sueish if you know what I mean, for two shows now it consentrated a little too much on her, so I have a small fear that she might end up like Bella from Twilight. Not good, not good at all.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the characters I forget now reason why they weren't really strong enough to gain my attention. 'sighs' I am not really looking forward to the next episodes, don't get me wrong the plot was descent, art was fair as was the characters, but the sound I am not. 'sighs' I will make sure to put it on subs next time though.\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment of this was a five. The voice cast just continued to lower my enjoyment so I really couldn't get into it, but I did enjoy watching Jiro beat up his little brother and Mimiko yell at Jiro. The humor was funny (with the exception of Jiro's moments.) but my enjoyment was pretty low.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give this a six. I can't give it a 5.3 like I want to but if you try to round five off you'll get a five so I will leave it with a mediocre rating. I didn't enjoy it is so much, the plot was descent, and art was fair, but be warned those who attempt the dub.. it was bad. Characters were all right to but not completely. There are more better vampire series than this to be honest.",

            "content": "I really did like the show, though I found it a bit hard to pick out what was happening now and happening back during the attack on Hong Kong because of some of the flash backs. Kotaro is a really cute and funny character, always getting into trouble and is a good contrast to his very old sounding brother, Jiro. It\u2019s nice that they had kept a version of the real vampire myths. They kept the *cough* feelings that happen when a vampire bites another, and some of the stuff about their weaknesses and such. The play between a couple of people is rather funincluding the strange Rinsuke Akai who seems to be rather flamboyant. He had no reason being there except for to be a yaoi fan girls dream.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is rather nice and fluid though we have one of the same problems as other shoes where we get the stupid motion lines. It\u2019s supposed to make it seem rather fast but it just feels cheesy most of the time. There are a lot of times that it does look cheaply made and characters look out of proportion, but I still like the show when it doesn\u2019t. I like how they change to a sort of grayer tone for when they show a flashback though I don\u2019t understand why they don\u2019t do it to the flashbacks of the Kowloon War.\\n\\n\r\nThe voices in the English dub are actually pretty fitting to the characters and not to off-putting. One of the problems I had was when some of the other characters were brought in. Their voices would ether be to low for me to hear and when I turned it up, the loud voices and music hurt my ears. The music has a pretty nice pop art sound to it and then it was balanced with a little bit of the piano music, and I never had trouble with it overpowering the scenes. Most fit pretty well though they did have some of side-walk walking music that made some characters fun.\\n",

            "content": "This is one of those shows which just had potential for more.\r\nUnfortunately, it failed in almost everything it tried to do.\r\nWhat a wasted opportunity.\r\nSTORY[6]:\r\n-> So generic it hurts. Story follows ex-vampire killer(vampire himself), a hero of a war which is shown in first episode and his attempts to protect his little brother, all that while dealing with various bits from his past. While it had a lot of potential because it was presented somewhat in a new way, it failed miserably due to the fact many things are just not explained. I dunno if there's manga which is supposed to be read before/after watching theshow, but from anime only point of view, too many things are not explained during this 12 episodes.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART[6]:\\n\r\n-> I wouldn't call art bad. Some effects are flashy and fights sometimes look good. However, most of the fights are just soldiers shooting at empty space with like thousands of bullets while vampires cut them down. The, how I like to call it, \"atmosphere art\" (trees, sky, etc.), is done really bad. And this is a big shame. Show has a lot of scenes in nature or on the river, and the scenery is just...bland. It just isn't \"alive\".\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND[7]:\\n\r\n-> OP song is really good. Unlike soundtrack, which is rather bad for a show with many emotional scenes, voice acting is done superbly. It's really easy to recognize characters by their voice, and emotions exist when they are talking. Too bad soundtrack doesn't follow.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER[6]:\\n\r\n-> I feel bad for giving this one a 6. But the fact is, this show maybe doesn't even deserve that much. Characters start off strong. Main character, Jirou, is presented as super-strong, but caring and gentle person. And while he's explained a lot in the beginning, any character development is nonexistent later on. Many characters just aren't developed at all. Cassa, probably main villain, but the way she acted, more of a nuisance than a villain, is completely forgotten when it comes to character development. This is category which could have been pure 10, but since the show is only 12 episodes and it rushed through many dialogs, it simply failed to deliver any real development, not only for secondary, but for main characters as well.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT[6]:\\n\r\n-> As always, this category won't be explained too much. I did enjoy it, especially first few episodes, but it just has too many flaws to really love it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL[6]:\\n\r\n->Just a 6 for a really good show. It really, really, really should have been 24 episodes long. Too many things unanswered, too many characters un(der)developed/unexplained, too many things rushed. A real shame.\\n\r\nI'll be honest, I did hope to find out there is season 2, but there isn't.\\n\r\nIt may be great manga(if there's one), but as anime, it failed.\\n\r\nPitty.",

Ten years later, Jiro heads to Hong Kong with his little brother, Kotaro Mochizuki, in hopes of reaching The Special Zone, a thriving secret city where Vampires live. They soon realize that a plan to infiltrate the Special Zone is being hatched by the Kowloon Children survivors. As they travel to The Special Zone, Jiro encounters enemies from the past and new threats that may endanger the safety of the Special Zone. The abduction of Kotaro, by one of the Kowloon Children, thrusts him even further into the battle.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nMost of the time in the series, they place the story of Jiro and his late lover in the beginning segments before the main plot surfaces onto the screen. It can be confusing for the first few times if that story doesn\u2019t intersect too much with the original focus but it didn\u2019t seem to bother me in the that track time. The pace for the show wasn\u2019t really quick but for an 12-episode series, it didn\u2019t drag out too long and it got to where it needed to be at that time but at the series\u2019 end, it should added at least one more episode to explain some further details but then again it was one of those \u201cyou have to read the manga to find out more\u201d type of show but it\u2019s mostly saying, \u201cRead for once in your life, you lazy fuck!!\u201d.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this series are not as flattering or even noteworthy of being memorable. Jiro plays the archetype of the vampire who still mourns for his lost love and somewhat an unstoppable force to reckon with\u2026\u2026well, not really. Water is his weakness. Yes, we can survive bullets and sometimes the sun since he does be in the daylight but water can really mess him up. Kotaro\u2026\u2026.should I feel bad that the first I see him in the show and he was banging on the coffin and Jiro beat him around, I laughed at that? But, yeah, Kotaro is basically the cheery comic relief of the show and he\u2019s not really helpful in this and the fact he does get kidnapped and put in danger a lot. He just seems more to get in the way of things then actually helping out. Mimiko wasn\u2019t too bad of a character to deal with, although she does chastise Jiro many times in the story. The only other character that actually does contribute to the story is Cassa, once friends with Jiro and his lover, Alice Eve (not the actress) but betrayed him by killing her.  Every other character (like Kelly Wong) gets tossed aside from show altogether, practically not caring whether their story matters at all.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is rather bland and uninteresting. It looks well done with 50% of the fight scenes but there\u2019s nothing more to that. Group TAC & Studio Live, the companies that provided the animation, really don\u2019t have anything else noticeable in their resume, aside assisting other animation studios on their projects but I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re going to have any future projects after this. The music is also surprisingly dull, albeit has a switch of melodic tone from the OP song to the ED song.  The BG music was nothing to expect anything new but average at best.\\n\\n\r\nFINAL VERDICT: It would be clich\u00e9 to say Black Blood Brothers brought nothing interesting or exciting to the table but it holds up to be pretty average in my book. Some parts you\u2019ll find to be remotely watchable and consistent but aside from that, it can be a mess to go through with.  I would say BBB is only good for a one-time watch and that\u2019s it.\\n",

            "content": "Solidly entertaining but ultimately quite average.\r\nPLOT: There\u2019s a decent enough storyline but sometimes I was left feeling that I wasn\u2019t getting the full picture. There is an awful lot going on \u2013 a myriad of side stories and back stories that are just not given enough time, it seems there would have easily been enough material to cover 26 episodes rather than the 12 on offer. As such we\u2019re left with a short show with a lot of characters and not enough time is allowed for character development. The end result is a lot of generic-ness. Its a pity because there some really interesting charactershere, notably the Old Blood vampires, and I would have loved to know a bit more about them \u2013 especially their roles during the Holy War. The primary antagonist Casa is never given a clear motive or back story either! So many hints and so little plot resolution = disappointment, but on the upside each episode is very entertaining in its own right. There\u2019s plenty of action and I was never bored, its only on reflection when writing a review that I realised how unfinished the show was. Still a good vampire show to pass the time with.  There is an ending but you get the feeling there should be more \u2013 it\u2019s more like the end of an arc rather than the end of a series.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION: Its fine, does the job. Nice enough character designs (although I hated Jirou\u2019s hat with a passion \u2013 its a crime against fashion!) all rather simple and clean. Vampire powers and fight scenes were well done too \u2013 overall its a fairly average looking show, not bad not brilliant.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC & VOICE ACTING: Music was passable \u2013 didn\u2019t like the OP, quite liked the ED. Voice acting was good though. Takahiro Sakurai (Suzaku \u2013 Code Geass, Kanda - D.Gray-Man) in the main role was great \u2013 Jirou\u2019s personality is quite hot and cold and Sakurai displayed a good range in his voice work.  Jun Fukuyama is in there too providing his \u2018Lelouch\u2019 voice as Zelman - who I really liked.\\n\\n\r\nSo all in all a good entertaining series, even if it feels a bit incomplete.",

The Silver Blade killed the Kowloon King and became known for his skill around the world. After the war ended, about ten years, Jiro leaves the safe, secluded home of the Dark Princess and her older brother Crow to the snowy north to Japan with his younger brother, Kotaro, to live in The Special Zone, a home made for vampires after the Hong Kong Crusade for them to live in peace. But they soon find out that The Special Zone isn't all what its cracked up to be. But before that, Jiro is greeted by a Compromiser, a person who is the &quot;peace-maker,&quot; between the vampires and humans and helps vampires get into the Special Zone as well as finding them a place to stay there.\\n\r\nBehind all this is the main plot, the friend that betrayed Jiro and Alice is planning on getting into the Special Zone as well. And when she arrives she will do whatever she can to get what she wants. The series makes the most of time-hopping through the different phases of the story, a particular artform the Japanese storytellers do well most of the time, but the cuts back and forth in these episodes can lose an unwary watcher along the way every so often.but all in all great anime",

That said, I was honestly apprehensive about risking another vampire anime. After having watched it, however, I must say: Among anime, I'd have to admit Black Blood Brothers is, by far, one of the better ones I've seen.\r\n  The story was also a definite strong point. It's covered in a refreshingly different style, with the first few minutes of each episode recounting the original events which led to the current situation.\r\n  The characters were also well made, with, for arefreshing change, no exceptionally annoying character present. For such a short anime (12 episodes) it explored most of the main characters fairly well.\\n\r\n  The music wasn't anything exceptional, but not bad either. Sadly, nothing here I'd spend some free time casually listening to.\\n\\n\r\n  The only major negative point I could find here was the plot. I'm not saying that it was handled poorly, but it kept giving me the feeling that would lead up to something more and still ends up a little lacking. It seems to have been left open for a possible second season.\\n\\n\r\n  Overall, I'd have to say I enjoyed this anime. I don't feel like I'd wasted my time watching it and I'm pretty sure, in the long run, I'll definitely watch it at least once more.\\n\\n\r\nMy overall rating: 8/10",

            "content": "Story: I found the story to be just the perfect blend of complex and simplistic. It's not the typical vampire themed Anime. There's plenty of great action, without the typical gore of vampire themes. I found the story to be less predictable, but it has tons of information in just 12 episodes. \r\nArt: I found the art to be rather simplistic. It reminded me of watching those older cartoons. Surprisingly, it works for this Anime. It didn't bother me, but I can see how it may bother some viewers. \r\nSound: The sound in this Anime sadly didn't capture me much. That may be a goodthing, because it means it didn't lack much. I do think this Anime has one of the best opening themes though. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: I found the characters in this Anime to be rather complex, yet some are extremely funny. The serious nature of some characters gives way to a moment of comedy, though keep in mind I have an odd sense of humor. Each character has a true purpose, and they're easy to keep track of. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This Anime is the kind someone will really enjoy. Whether you're sick of vampire themes or not. It's got actions, serious plot, humor, and more. The only way it couldn't be enjoyable is if it seems far too cartoonish to some. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: In the end, I'd say most people would enjoy this Anime. It's only 12 episodes, so it goes by rather quickly. It's got a rather unique feel to it, for it being a vampire theme. I guess I'd call it more of a family friendly type Anime. It's worth checking out a couple episodes, if not the whole thing.",

Enter Mochizuki Jirou, a badass vampire with a great backstory.\r\nRight off the bat, I'm going to say that Jirou is by far the coolest anime character I've ever seen. Think about that for a second; there are a lot of pretty awesome characters out there, and this guy is the most awesome (in my opinion). He's also stuck carting around his little brother Kotaro, and their relationship is really cute. \r\nThe city-building and vampire-rules building in BBB aresuperb, almost on a Trueblood level. Only pureblood vampires burn in the sun (including our Jirou, and it's very amusing when he does), so they have to take interesting precautions. Try this one, as it's a short but effective vampire tale.",

            "content": "Black Blood Brothers was one of the first anime I've watched, and at this point, I have watched it through twice. Although it is in no way a perfect story (but is there such a thing?), it presented a great level of enjoyment through characters. \r\nPositives: \r\nIf you like stories where even the supporting cast have a level of depth, then this will probably get high points for you. Everyone from the MC (Jirou) to important, yet-not-often-present characters (such as Zelman), are so amazingly fun that I think the story could be flat and /still/ quite enjoyable. \r\nAlso, Jirou's fighting is just plain cool. \r\nNegatives:\\n\r\nThe fact that the plot is basically zombie-vampires (and somehow that is not redundant in this case) could be a negative or a positive, though for the most part they were more embarrassing than threatening. \\n\\n\r\nBBB seemed to force a degree of sensuality  that was entirely unnecessary, and to put it bluntly, immature. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I give BBB a 9 solely for the funness in character that made the entire thing enjoyable, until the weak, rather silly, ending. All the same, this is worth a watch due to its short length, and colorful characters.",

The main character is looking for some kind of redemption through taking care of his little brother and, along the way, his past comes back to haunt him. Pretty simple stuff. There was some originality here and there, but over all, been there, done that.\r\nSome of the character's were interesting. I personally liked Zelman Clock. I really would have liked to learn more about the three territory heads, but the story never goes into themtoo much. The main character was a little like they took Alucard from hellsing and Abel from Trinity Blood and jammed them together in some really weird mash up topped off with a wizards hat. The lead female was stale and had less character then the little boy. It was painful to watch her.\\n\\n\r\nThe story was just much too short to really let it go anywhere. The art and sound were average, like the rest of the show.\\n\\n\r\nAll and all, it's a good anime if you have nothing else to be watching or you are really REALLY into Vampire anime.",

Which leaves me hanging. . . . And I don't like being left like that!!!\r\nWhat I Liked: Zelman Clock. That is all. \r\nBut, seriously, the characters were amazing. Although the relationship between Jiro and his younger brother wasn't the closest I'd ever seen, it was still touching. And I will blow up like a stick of dynomite if Mimiko and Jiro don't get together. I didn't care AT ALL about Jiro's background. Honestly, Ithink \"Rule of Cool\" would defiinitely fit this anime if it wanted. It's funny, but can be serious, as well.\\n\r\nWhat I Didn't Like: All the drama circulating Jiro's past. I didn't think it was necessary, but that's just me. The fact that Zelman didn't get a lot of screentime hit a nerve, as he's the epitome of all things sexy!!! And the fact that I'll probably never see Mimiko and Jiro together. . . . Sorry, but I'm a sucker for romance. \\n\r\nOverall, I give this anime a 9/10, just because it's good enough that only twelve episode can leave me fuming like this. . . . Definitely recommended!!! :)\\n",

There's not a huge amount of depth to this, no particularly deep characterisation or complex theme's and moral shades. It\u2019s just a cool setting with cool characters doing cool things, and I can really appreciate that. You can sit down in front of BBB and your guaranteed to be entertained for the next few hours. And at the end of the day that\u2019s really all one can ask from a media product. I'd suggest getting the first episode and watching that, if after the first five minutes yournot interested then you might as well move along (its rather like Samurai 7 in that manner).",

Jirou\u2019s character acts tough but you see thelove he has for his brother; and Kotarou is always smiling, he brings light into Jirou\u2019s otherwise gloomy mood. Black Blood Brothers is a 12 episode series I recommend watching. I do hope they do a 2nd season.",
