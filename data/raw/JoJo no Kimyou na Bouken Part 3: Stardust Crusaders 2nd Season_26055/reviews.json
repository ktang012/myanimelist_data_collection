            "content": "Definitely some spoilers, don't read if you don't want to be spoiled.\r\nStory: 3\r\nThe story became very repetitive at this point. Most of the episodes were: Go from current point to next point, encounter enemy Stand user, defeat stand user, repeat until we reach Dio. It became a monster-of-the-week series and it just felt really bland. The fights varied somewhat but in the end I was expecting a little more than what was essentially an RPG grind until you hit max level and go do an end game boss.\r\nArt: 9\r\nThe art style definitely made everything feel more dramatic and dark, while the backgrounds gave a reallygood view of what Egypt looks like (at least from someone who hasn't been there). The characters themselves are very detailed with proper shadings of clothing which makes them look 'realistic'.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nThe op of the first season was really good and it got you pumped up and it made you feel manlier just by listening to it. But this second season's op just reminded me of Rozen Maiden, it doesn't fit. The voice acting is the same as the first season so if you liked it there, you'll like it here, especially hearing Jonathan yell \"AWEEE MAIII GAWDDDDD\" or \"SHIIIIITTTT\".\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5\\n\r\nThe villains felt very cliched in that they're always over the top sadistic with no redeeming qualities. Each one was basically just 'bad guy with certain bad trait' repeated over and over every episode until we got to Dio. \\n\\n\r\nDio - Dio maintains his arrogance and threatening nature which definitely made him feel like an end raid boss and reinforces his antagonistic role.\\n\\n\r\nJoutarou - If you can call standing around, posing 'cool' and saying \"Yare Yare Daze\" as being a character... well... he's a character for you then. Initially, this was kind of cool, the nonchalant, tough without overtness attitude, but after two seasons of this composure, it starts to become dull and repetitive. Any encounters that involve Joutarou is basically resolved before it even begins and all you're left doing is thinking how far his legs are going to be apart this time and how angled is his body going to face.\\n\\n\r\nJonathan - Not as cool as when he was younger with all his predictions but still a staple character that is hilarious when he swears/yells in Engrish. \\n\\n\r\nPolnareff - Basically the comic relief of the show but his character really shines during his emotional moments with his comrades, especially Iggy.\\n\\n\r\nIggy - I initially didn't like him as his existence felt out of place most of the time as he didn't do very much, but in later episodes his character really develops and I liked him near the end. \\n\\n\r\nAvdol - A firm, stable character that really cares for his friends and even sacrifices himself. Things actually happen to him which makes him feel mortal and human.\\n\\n\r\nKakyouin - Really stayed the same from the first season though his bonds with his comrades grows stronger. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nDefinitely wasn't as enjoyable as the first season as the encounters with the other Stand users felt very repetitive and monster-of-the-week. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\r\nAt this point, it just became repetitive until we came to the final showdown between Dio and JoJo.",

            "content": "An action-packed adventure of fun, bizarreness, crazy gimmicks, and dangerous distinction. Jojo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure Stardust Crusaders: Second Season (or Egypt Arc) provokes the question of what the audience wants to see next. The first half of the adaptation already showed plenty of Stands ranging from one that can attack via reflective surfaces, a parasitic being that can enter a victim\u2019s brain, or even a Stand that can attack in dreams with Freddy Krueger style. The answer is simple really. It continuously deliver a source of imaginative and entertainment that almost anyone will find entrancing.\r\nAs a direct continuation of the first season, it\u2019s imperative to watchit before venturing into the Egypt Arc. Otherwise, you\u2019ll be wondering around like a goat in a desert. Propelled by the series\u2019 vision to craft a dynamic adventure, we are introduced to new allies and enemies. Of course, the main cast returns as well including Jotaro, Joseph, Avdol, Kakyoin, and Polnareff. Joining them is a new ally in the form a dog named Iggy. Bringing in non-human characters into a series always presents a challenge but Iggy isn\u2019t just an ordinary house common animal. He has a Stand and there\u2019s even an episode that really brings out his abilities for the audience to see. \\n\\n\r\nBecause the first season has exhausted Dio\u2019s resources and servants, we are introduced to new and more dangerous enemies for the crusaders. Adapting well with its Egyptian theme, these new enemies presents a challenge like never before. We have Big Bads that do all sort of otherworldly things that people can\u2019t even begin to imagine. It really brings a focus to Jotaro and his friends as they struggle to survive. A good measure of the fights not just test them on a physical level either but mentally as well. The D\u2019arby siblings are a good example of this as they rely on trickery and deception to get what they want by pitting their enemies in twisted mind games. Then, there\u2019s also the creativity coming from the brainchild of the series, Hirohiko Araki. The characters he makes not just possess a diverse range of personalities but also has Stands that bring out their sheer tenderness. As daring as some of his ideas are, they work well when it comes to bringing a mixture of thrilling excitement, mystery, and humor.\\n\\n\r\nIndeed, the comedy for the series is like no other. From the artistic style of Boingo\u2019s Tohth to Sethan\u2019s power of age manipulation, there\u2019s almost something in it for everyone to witness. Furthermore, the gimmicks of the show return in full with our main characters\u2019 personalities. They may all have different personalities but their goal in hand is the same \u2013 to save Holly from death. As such, expect the mood of the story to get more and tenser as the journey takes them closer and closer into Dio\u2019s palace. However, there will still be times when the story feels like a \u2018monster of the week\u2019 style. Certain characters also makes reappearances that gives them another chance to shine.  For what\u2019 worth, this second season behaves in a similar way with the first half in conjunction with their journey. Then, the latter half really picks up the pace as we get to the grand stage. Patience is a key to understand and enjoy the show as David Productions is willing to adapt the most important element of the story. To capture that style of Jojo is never easy but adapting with a steady pacing with weekly doses of adventure is something to take granted for. As such, I recommend watching this show in a weekly style rather than a whole marathon. It will leave you wanting for more as each episode brings something new to the table. And when the battle against Dio draws to its climax, you\u2019ll realize that the patience was well worth waiting for.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork of the second season along with its soundtrack remains generally the same but still retains the sense of exhilarating fun. Taking place in Egypt, we get more of the classic Egyptian-like atmosphere with more desert themes involved. As such, expect the soundtrack to reflect a bit of that culture. Opening theme songs are also clear with its choice by orchestrating the classic Jojo style that we should all be familiar with by this point. Surprisingly though, the ED theme songs has a more vibrant and melancholic tune. While seemingly off balance in some sense, I find it to be captivating as it creates a sense of serenity. Finally, there\u2019s also the character voices that each reflect dynamically at how the characters behave. The villains\u2019 textural motives also has a good amount of credible voice mannerisms to make the audience feel what their roles are. Then, there\u2019s the artwork that continuously dedicates itself to capture what this journey been \u2013 crude, dangerous, and insane. However, that\u2019s all in a good way. (minus some editing of the censors) David Productions\u2019 visual standards impresses with their work by delivering stellar landscapes, well-made architectures, and a wealth of character designs to make the audiences awe. Similarly, expect the action to blow you out of the seats with its extensive prowess.\\n\\n\r\nIn a nutshell, the second season is what you will expect and get. And that would be thrilling action packed adventure of non-stop pandemonium. It\u2019s a show that unites all sorts of strange gimmicks to deliver what the audience wants. Assuming that you like stunts, unpredictable characters, mind games, or dynamic comedy, then this season will be quite a looker. Now, this might not be a show for anyone though. There are at times problems when people feel like pacing becomes sour and certain parts from the original source omitted. Or there may be certain characters that get lesser screen time than others. However, the adventure never stop at its mark and packs its bag. Instead, it shows why the series is called Jojo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure. And that is freaking awesome. \\n",

No matter how hard you try to ignore these trends, they keep popping up, and it almost feels like it is impossible to stay up to date in the anime world without watching/reading them. At least for me, not staying up to date is like being dead in this world of anime.\r\nJoJo was one of these trending things, and I tried real hard to ignore it, because  getting myself in the JoJo world would only fatten upmy backlog. However, then back in 2012, I heard JoJo manga (which is quite old) is getting animated, and thought this was a good chance for me to get myself into the series.\\n\r\nMay be I was crazy or something, but I thought at that time, it would be better for me to finish the manga before I watch the anime. This doesn't  mean you have to do the same thing and read the entire manga before watching the show! I mean, I loved the manga, but it's really your choice, because the anime has done an excellent job faithfully adapting the source material.\\n\r\nThe entire JoJo show is 26+48 episodes. I know it is a daunting task to watch all that, but the show is a fun-ride that is fast and satisfying.\\n\r\nMy point it that JoJo is quite an old franchise, which is still very popular in modern times, so if you want to stop wondering what all the JoJo hype is all about, this fun show is an excellent starting point. I recommend you start watching this now if you are interested, because sequels might come flying in soon in the future (meaning your backlog will only get greater....yuck)\\n\\n\r\nSo, if you are looking for:\\n\r\nMeticulously animated fun, swift, merciless, cathartic actions\\n\r\nSilly, over-the-top but clever thrills\\n\r\nCharacter interactions grotesquely fun\\n\r\nRidiculously Faithful adaptation of the source material\\n\r\nShows without silly unnecessary soap opera-esque romances and fillers\\n\r\nManly Men full of manliness\\n\\n\r\nand/or if you are just curious what all this JoJo is about...\\n\\n\r\nThis show is for you.\\n\r\n(so if you decide to watch this, be sure to start from Parts 1 and 2 from 2012~)",

            "content": "The second season of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders is the when all the real stuff of the 3rd part of JoJo manga happens. \r\nIt picks up right where the first season left off and doesn't waste a moment to start doing what Stardust Crusaders does best, and that is episodic, intense, imaginative fights. Not much is changed in the overall sturcture of the show. It still follows the formula of traveling from one place to another, and encountering new enemies on the way in an episodic manner. \r\nThe cream of the entire show are fights, and I am happy to say that the secondseason is where most of the better fights from the manga take place. The fights in the second season are longer and way more intense and imaginative. The fact that unlike the first season, the second one has a define ending, really helps the show too. I honestly think that both season should be judge as one anime show, because they are just a single story, divided in two parts, because it would take too many episdoes to adapt it all in one season.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is still over the top as all and rather silly or dumb at places. Thankfuly it knows when not to take itself seriously and thus the sillyness never really hinders the experience too much.\\n\\n\r\nThis season has a healty dose of fun episodes and moments, is also has a healthy amount of rather touching and sad parts. Some characters get a bit more development, some don't. We also get a new character in the face of Iggy the dog, who is heck lot of fun to watch and really adds to the chemistry of the entire group.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is still awesome looking. The soundtrack is more of the same for the most part, not that there is anything wrong with that. The soundtrack for the first season was really good by itself. Even if the animation itself is pretty static, the design,style and directing make the anime look wonderful.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it is a darn great finale for the adaptation of the third part of the JoJo's Bizarre Adventrue manga. It left me completely satisfied and I really hope they will keep adapting the manga into more seasons of anime. After all the next part: Part 4 Diamond is Unbreakable is really great.",

            "content": "The JoJo series is a very peculiar beast, one ridden with overly muscular super humans, flamboyantly stunning poses, and over-the-top battles that are sure to fill your battle shounen needs. All of these elements are turned up to 11 for Part 3, also known as Stardust Crusaders. While the first season of Stardust Crusaders helped get the ball rolling, the second season had me fully invested, excitedly awaiting my dose of weekly JoJo tomfoolery and badassery.\r\nAdmittedly, I've yet to read or watch Part 1 and 2 of JoJo(as of writing this review) [Update: Caught up through Part 4 of the anime - JoJo fever isin full effect]. I know that seems to throw my merit right out the door, but let me explain! Last year I was in the heat of my anime-watching routine, picking up almost every seasonal show, in an attempt to expand my knowledge of anime and stay up-to-date with current favorites. This of course, was not an easy task, as I quickly drowned in a sea of anime, unable to find enough reason in my wavering heart to drop the shows I only saw as 'okay'. Thus, I became entrapped in a vicious cycle of show-binging, simply to keep up with everything else. But there are always a few diamonds in the rough, and one exceptional outlier starred a highschool boy with the physique of an Olympic athlete and a hat that formed a union with his hair.\\n\\n\r\nJoJo gave me quite the entertaining first impression. The art style and character designs were immediately reminiscent of Fist of the North Star, which was a refreshing difference from the copy-paste character designs I was getting from many other shows on-air. The story arc had been laid out plain and simple within the first few episodes, and while it was nothing exceptionally captivating, I knew already that JoJo was going to be about the journey, not the destination. Week after week, each battle became more and more preposterous, adding new levels of insanity to every consequent duel. JoJo had revealed to me its true nature - it was an outrageous satire of anime past, showcasing every lame catchphrase and ridiculous character tropes from the likes of Fist of the North Star coincidentally. While it was a satire, what made JoJo stand out was its ability to be a really freakin' well-made satire. Catchphrases were cheesy, but hilarious, fight scenes were ludicrous, but thrilling nonetheless. It didn't take long for me to jump on the JoJo train, and soon I couldn't survive the week without seeing their silly, well-toned faces.\\n\\n\r\nSkip to the beginning of 2015. The year has begun anew, and soon to follow suit, another season of JoJo was about to begin. Jotaro and his fellow Stardust Crusaders, Avdol, Kakyoin, Polnareff, Joseph, and Iggy had finally made it to Egypt, the location of their decisive battle against the fabulously immortal vampire Dio. With the majority of the plot setup and character introductions behind us, all that lie ahead was non-stop Stand-on-Stand action. An issue of pacing can arise with a formula built around weekly showdowns (some special one\u2019s made into 2-parters), but Stardust Crusaders handles this excellently with its colorful main cast and a plethora of unique enemies who stand in their way. The Crusaders themselves are one of the best groups I\u2019ve seen in an action show for the past few seasons (I\u2019m looking at you, Kirito and your harem brigade). Each one has distinct personalities and quirks that make their interactions with one another pure gold. \\n\\n\r\nJotaro retains the role of the tough-guy school delinquent, but he\u2019s so physically and mentally calm and collected, that he doesn\u2019t come off as an idiot, which is much appreciated for that type of character. His super-serious attitude can even be hilarious if given the right comedic timing. Joseph Joestar returns quite a bit older from his role in Battle Tendency, but his childish nature still shines through. Joseph is quite the card, responsible for some of the funniest moments in Stardust Crusaders; his infamous \u201cOH MY GOD\u201d engrish reactions are priceless. Muhammad Avdol is very serious and a bit of a caretaker to the rest of the irresponsible adventurers. He acts as a guide and cultural resource for the Joestars as they make their trek through the Middle East. Noriaki Kakyoin is a fellow student of Jotaro\u2019s, and also one of the more serious characters, but he is also very genuine, showing signs of compassion several times throughout the journey. Jean Pierre Polnareff is the unsung hero of Stardust Crusaders, getting just about or maybe even more screen time than even the Joestars. Polnareff is your typical loud-mouth hero, who isn\u2019t afraid to speak his mind and emote as much as he deems appropriate. But underneath his clumsy exterior is a very protective, and passionate warrior. Possibly the most complex of the bunch, his screen time is adequate in proportion to the amount of character development he needed. Lastly there\u2019s Iggy, an abrasive dog, frequently acting on his own accord and staying relatively antisocial. While he is supposed to be with the Crusaders to aid their struggle, he seems to be more of an annoyance, especially to Polnareff, whom Iggy consistently enjoyed terrorizing. Iggy\u2019s worth to the team comes out in small spurts at first, both consciously and unconsciously saving the group without them realizing it most of the time. This is a grade-A main cast, and Stardust Crusaders does each one justice by allotting specific episodic battle to each of them pretty equally, though I wouldn\u2019t have complained if Kakyoin and Avdol got a little more time up front.\\n\\n\r\nEven more entertaining than our heroes is the variety of enemies they face along the way. Perhaps the most enthralling part of JoJo is waiting to see what the next Stand user was going to throw at the Crusaders. There\u2019s basically no limit to the concept of a Stand, so the amount of possible Stands and users is practically endless. We follow the Crusaders as they face a cursed sword who makes a master out of its wielder, wager their souls against a conniving high stakes gambler, and even duke it out with a Stand-using orangutan. If there is one thing JoJo creator Hirohiko Araki does exceptionally well, it is character creation. Every battle felt fresh and exciting. The fights themselves were also very distinct in how they played out. The Oingo Boingo twins clumsily stumbled through their failed Jotaro assassination attempt, which was one of the funniest episodes in the series. On the other hand, the crew\u2019s battle with the High Priestess in the submarine was exhilarating and had me on the edge of my seat. And of course it\u2019s hard to forget the illusionary obstacle created by the Sun Stand, which once figured out, was quickly and amusingly disposed of. While many of them were one-off characters, momentary obstacles only to be replaced in the following episode, a lot of the enemies were very well written and designed, and I found a lot of the charm in JoJo could be discovered through attachments created to these short-lived villains.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I am fond of the macho-man aesthetic of the JoJo universe, it wasn\u2019t the only artistic choice I was keen on observing. The palette swap during some intense fight scenes became a standard affair during the show. The psychedelic color schemes that embodied these moments were a great addition to atmosphere building, the pastel colors representing a state of confusion, letting the viewer know that something quite perplexing was at hand. The use of \u2018unsound effects\u2019 such as the words \u201cmenacing\u201d drifting across the screen are a delightful nod to the manga, and has equal effectiveness in setting up the tone of upcoming showdowns. The show\u2019s direction is on-point during battle sequences, as if each character were aware of their on-screen close-up, they assume theatrically stylish poses as they outwit their opponent. Dramatic pans to full character stitches are expectedly followed up with brief attack explanations or memorable one-liners, avoiding exhaustingly drawn-out details and replacing them with fast paced, concisely explained sequences. Not a moment feels wasted during the show\u2019s combat, keeping my attention indefinitely, eyes glued to the screen the entire time.\\n\\n\r\nOne element of Stardust Crusaders that caught me completely off guard was the quality of the show\u2019s OP\u2019s and ED\u2019s. All four songs are littered with hints about events that occur throughout the season, making their replay value astronomically high; each watch possibly revealing a detail you didn\u2019t catch the previous time. The 3D rendered characters from the OP\u2019s look as if they\u2019ve jumped straight out of JoJo\u2019s All Star Battle videogame; their designs are sleek, and animation is fluid. Both OP\u2019s are successful at instilling hype for each forthcoming episode, especially the special versions of the OP that appear in the last few episodes. While the OP\u2019s can effectively get the blood flowing, the ED\u2019s take a surprisingly relaxed approach. The use of American bands for both songs was a perfect fit for the reference-centric JoJo universe, as Araki is fairly well-known for naming his characters after American musicians. The first song, \u201cWalk Like an Egyptian\u201d by The Bangles is a fairly obvious choice, but an excellent one nonetheless. The second ED choice was much more abstract, but all the more welcomed. \u201cLast Train Home\u201d by Pat Metheny Group is a sobering melody, a lone guitar howls as night falls and our heroes make their grand departure. While the song seems a bit unfit for the episodes that ended with sweat-inducing cliffhangers, it\u2019s the perfect conclusion for some of the more heartfelt episodes, and flawlessly wraps up the season. With this perilous journey behind the Crusaders, \u201cLast Train Home\u201d embodies their peace of mind, leaving a final fleeting moment for reflection and remembrance of the trials they\u2019ve overcome and the memories they\u2019ve made together. (Fun fact: The ED \u201cLast Train Home\u201d introduced me to the wonderful jazz fusion of Pat Metheney, who I have since grown fond of, and I now own a vinyl of his first album, which has \u201cLast Train Home\u201d on it.)\\n\\n\r\nUpon completing Stardust Crusaders, I originally gave it an 8, and began my reviewing process. But after further consideration, and as my review neared its end, I had several realizations which led me to bump my score up to a 9. I realize now that I had ZERO expectations going into JoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure. Having no prior knowledge of its existence and setting no standards for what lie ahead, I was completely blown away by the end of Part 3. An anime I had picked up without a second thought had quickly become one of my favorite shows of the year. Even for the veteran JoJo fan\u2019s Part 3 was handled with extreme care. David Productions really went all out; from the music, to animation, to voice acting, it\u2019s obvious that everyone involved with the project took it to heart, and their collective effort gave us the spectacular escapade that is Stardust Crusaders. \\n\\n\r\nAnd now, it\u2019s about time I catch up on Part 1 and 2. ORA ORA ORA!!!\t\\n",

            "content": "\"Do you remember how many breads you have eaten in your life?\" - Dio Brando.\r\nA journey that will make you laugh....\r\nA journey that will fill you with emotions.....\r\nA journey that will leave you with a feeling of both victory and tragedy.....\r\nA journey that gives you a unique experience and in the end........\r\nleaves you completely satisfied.\r\nThis journey is the thrilling conclusion to Stardust Crusaders. A journey worth remembering and one worth savoring. My dramatical hyping aside, this is the show that separates the fabulous men from.......well the ordinary ones and as the title suggest you won't find anything ordinary here.\r\nLet me start of by saying thatI recently became a fan of Jojo's last year and have never been big into reading manga, so this is isn't going to be a comparison and contrast to that, rather this is going to be me going on about my feelings on the franchise as a whole and how well this stacks up to its first season.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all I think it goes without saying that if you know anything about series such as Fist of the North Star you would know that the foundation of the Jojo's franchise is heavily based up on various plot lines and arcs from the Fist of the North Star. So if you aren't familiar with that series I would highly suggest doing some research into it. I felt this show, having watched the franchise before finishing Fist of the North Star up, had given me a greater appreciation for Fist of the North Star and what it did. What I love about Jojo's Bizarre Adventure however, is how it slowly goes from being a parody series, to an entirely different entity on its own and it IS AWESOME. \\n\\n\r\nFor anyone who has yet to dive into the second half of Stardust Crusaders, not much has changed from the first, outside of the fact that the stakes have been raised significantly, with stands so crazy powerful and bad ass they have blown the first couple out of the water. The series for me is definitely making up for the lack of story elements that were far more present in the Phantom Blood and Battle Tendency story lines.\\n\\n\r\nNow even though there is a lack of story elements within Stardust Crusaders not just in part, but as a whole, they add in more clever intricacies that you may not notice at first. Those constant crazy turns in the series are a HUGE part of the enjoyment factor many will ignore when comparing Stardust Crusaders to its older brothers. While Battle Tendency did have many twist and turns they were ,for the most part, in Joseph's favor, however here it's all fair game. An example of these intricacies is when the characters (good or bad) are in a situation that seems impossible to get out of and there is almost always a work around. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and characters are all still very unique and colorful just as they always have been and there is still a lot of over the top action and violence. The music still has a mix of Rock and Jazz (Though I personally prefer the first half's Intro and Outro). All of this may put off some, but if it does.......what the hell are you doing watching Jojo's Bizarre Adventure in the first place? With all that said if you're a newcomer and only plan on watching the Stardust Crusaders portion of the Jojo's franchise (though I highly suggest against doing so) this is not a bad place to start, you aren't missing a lot of plot points that WON'T be addressed plenty of times over and over in this half.\\n\\n\r\nJojo's Bizarre adventure is a series that you can clearly tell is not only a loving homage, but takes pride in making its own wonderful, creative universe that is far from being a carbon copy of your \" Run-of-the-Mill\" Shonen series. It TRULY does its best to break the trend of what people seem to expect at face value and really that's above and beyond what anyone was asking for to begin with. Regardless of the harsh criticisms it gets due to the existence of its older brothers and even future parts, Stardust Crusaders is definitely a hell of a ride in its on right.\\n\\n\r\nAs it is, Jojo's Bizarre adventure is a great Shonen series and a great action series in general with a great blend of Comedy and awkwardness that unbelievably works with flashy flair-Stardust Crusaders' second half is no different. If you enjoy what you got out of the first 3 seasons, you most likely won't be disappointed. It's a classic epitome of manliness that stands proud along such works as Gurren Lagann, Berserk, Fist of the North Star and others. A race against time and a quest for the ages--- There can only be one word worthy of describing this generational conflict, this tale is truly deserving of being dubbed, \"Epic\". \\n",

            "content": "***SPOILER WARNING***\r\nThis review is going to be comparing stardust crusaders 2nd season with not just the 1st season, but also the prequel to that, with the blood phantom and battle tendency arcs.\r\nStory: 5/10\r\nSadly the story of the 2nd season didn't really develop anything meaningful since the 1st and that resulted in a lot of episodes feeling pretty meaningless. The 1st season has the crew finally arrive in egypt after defeating the woman on the beach with her stand and pretty much every single thing of this whole season of 24 episodes can be summarized with one sentence:\r\n\"The crew search for DIO and repeatedly get inconveniencedby a bunch of people ordered to kill them and eventually after beating all of them, they fight him and win.\"\\n\\n\r\nThat's it. No actual plot twists or anything, just that. So all of the episodes of this season are dedicated to battles and a bunch of them feel really like filler due to how obnoxious some of the characters are, which I'll get into.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art of stardust crusaders in general is fine, though I personally find the art of the blood phantom and battle tendency arcs to be more enjoyable than stardust crusaders. As far as quality is concerned, it has objectively improved along the way regardless of my own preferences.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound quality in general is good, and like the 1st season there's plenty of hilarious yelling from old man joseph, which was extremely enjoyable for a lot of episodes. However, there are some characters with voices that just sucked horribly and they just wouldn't go away! Mondatta comes to mind first, which was one of the \"opponents\" referenced above that made multiple episodes feel like total filler. The voice of this character was comparable to nails on chalkboard.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition to that, I feel the VA was pretty poor for Iggy the dog. It sounded too distant from what a dog barking would actually sound like, enough to the point where it hardly felt like the character was even a dog.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I think about how fun the blood phantom and especially battle tendency arcs were to watch, it really puts it into perspective how much less entertaining JJBA is without speedwagon constantly losing his shit as he's narrating intense moments in the show. There are also way less explosions and it feels the intensity levels overall were botched in stardust crusaders.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion this is where JJBA's stardust crusaders falls short the most, because of multiple different reasons. First let's start with the main protagonists and compare them to the blood phantom and battle tendency arcs.\\n\\n\r\nSo in blood phantom the main protagonist was Jonathan Joestar, first introduced as a loyal and righteous boy with a wealthy background, struggling to cope with life thanks to DIO's invasion and grows up to become a hero, becoming manlier and braver as the episodes pass. He has actual character development and as such is very likeable as a protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nThen the battle tendency arc comes about and we're introduced to the grandson of Jonathan, Joseph Joestar. This has to be BY FAR the best protagonist of JJBA. He's hilarious, clever, strong as fuck, brave, quick-thinking, and full of surprises and entertainment from start to finish of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThen when we get to stardust crusaders it all falls apart. Joseph at this point is an old man, so the spotlight is mainly given to his grandson Jotaro Kujo. See, there's literally NO character development whatsoever with Jotaro. The moment he's introduced into the series, his personality is the exact same throughout both seasons 1 and 2 and he's never at any point more interesting than his grandpa was at his age. Is he a badass? Sure, of course. He has his moments in the show where he outwits his opponents and pulls out some awesome finishes but there's only so much you can do with that before everything feels the exact same.\\n\\n\r\nThe other protagonists are where it *really* went to shit, however. The forced deaths of Avdol in season 1 and season 2, in addition to Kakyoin's, were so pointless and obnoxious in my opinion because it felt as if there was literally no way to make the fight with DIO interesting enough as it was without forcing some of the main characters to die to make it seem more serious than it actually is. I personally was fine with Iggy being discarded because he was pretty much only added as a comedic aspect to the show and ended up being more annoying than he was funny, imho.\\n\\n\r\nNow we're left with the antagonists. The entire time, everything was centered around DIO, who we remember as the main enemy of blood phantom that caused Jonathan to die, so we are immediately interested from the start of season 1 to see how the story will play out and to see more action like that! Yeah! ... no.\\n\\n\r\nWe hardly see DIO *at all* for the whole 48 episodes of stardust crusaders... until the last 4 episodes of season 2. He was the only opponent of season 2 that wasn't a joke honestly and with all of the crazy obscure shit that the stand users pulled off in both seasons 1 and 2 you're expecting something INTENSE for DIO to have when the crew finally finds him in egypt, right?\\n\\n\r\nWell his stand is literally just the same as Jotaro's with strength/precision and he can stop time for a few seconds. While that's obviously powerful, it feels like such a cheap trick... it's so unexciting and so much less mighty and god-like that I expected and made him seem so much less powerful than I believed him to be... and sure enough, he dies pretty easily at the hands of Jotaro anyways. Clearly the author of this had a lapse of creativity here because this was a pretty big letdown for me.\\n\\n\r\nAs an antagonist, DIO in stardust crusaders was so much less sinister than he was in the blood phantom arc and you can't even compare him to how terrifyingly powerful and threatening to humanity that the pillar men were in the battle tendency arc.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nDespite my gripes with stardust crusaders, I still found it entertaining enough to watch. There were some episodes that were a lot more interesting than others, such as D'arby the poker player that Jotaro defeated. I also found the episodes with old man Joseph getting into trouble with the magnetic force stand user HILARIOUS. I couldn't stop laughing at his terrified yelling!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe stardust crusaders seasons are worth watching but in terms of story and character development and overall enjoyment it absolutely fell short for me compared to the preceding arcs.",

            "content": "Now I'm going to let you know in advance that Stardust Crusaders is my favorite manga of all time. So I'm a little biased toward it and it's anime adaptation but I am going to write a review to the best of my abilities taking this into consideration.\r\nWhat is the beast called Jojo's Bizarre Adventure you ask? If you're looking at this with no prior experience with the series you should go watch Jojo's Bizarre Adventure (2012) which is an adaptation of the first two parts you need to watch! Jojo's is a legendary manga series that spans many genres of manga including Shounen, Seinen,Slice of Life and so on and so forth. It's definitely worth a read. Today we're going to be talking about the anime adaptation of the most iconic part in the series to date, Stardust Crusaders. \\n\\n\r\nStory: Now the story for Stardust is fairly simple but it works and is enjoyable, tough delinquent Jotaro Kujo has locked himself in prison to protect his mother from what he deems an evil spirit. Holly, his mother, along with Joseph Joestar and Muhammad Avdol come to bail him out. This is where he discovers he has an ability linked to him called a \"stand\" which are spirits that have many different abilities that you'll see later in the adventure. When Jotaro arrives home, his mother Holly falls down ill because of the stand she begins to develop and the gang discovers that the only way to save Holly is to defeat DIO who has developed a super powerful stand of his own. (who you should know from the previous series) This is when Jotaro Kujo, Joseph Joestar, Muhammad Avdol and Kakyoin Noriaki decide that they have to set off to Egypt to find and finally kill DIO once and for all. The story is serviceable but what really makes Crusaders special is the off the wall fights that take place, ESPECIALLY in the second season. Look out for the D'arby brothers, Vanilla Ice and DIO's specifically. \\n\\n\r\nArt: The art of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure is very unique, unlike anything I've ever seen before and honestly that's the only reason it's so high. Vibrant colors and amazing character designs make every scene a delight to watch. NOW onto the cons, the animation is awful. It's seriously almost like a slideshow at times, the bright colors and palette swaps are what makes it special. Some panels look VERY ugly which is to be expected of most anime at this point. \\n\\n\r\nSound: The OST for SDC is probably one of the strongest points. The intros, Stand Proud and Sono Chi No Kioku having amazing animations and are just great songs in general. They'll be stuck in your head for a long time even if they aren't as good as Sono Chi No Sadame. The sound design is very good too, the sound effects that come with Star Platinum's punches are all satisfying. ***SPOILERS*** When DIO's stand, the World, activates it's time stop there's another amazing sound effect that sounds like, for lack of a better explanation, wubs from a dubstep song. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Now onto the strongest part of Jojo's as a whole, the characters. The entire cast of Stardust Crusaders are colorful and entertaining characters. Jotaro Kujo and Jean Pierre Polnareff are two of my favorites. The stern bancho wearing thug Jotaro is a perfect match with his mentor and grandfather Joseph. Jean Pierre Polnareff serves as both comic relief and a pillar to the crew as a whole as he's one of the strongest fighters present. The returning and older Joseph, Kakyoin and Iggy are also fan favorites. These guys make the experience twenty times better and you'll miss them by time this part/arc ends. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: While fan reception of this part is mixed, you're bound to enjoy the intense action, funny/memorable characters and unique art. Give the first two parts a try and if you enjoyed them, move right on to part 3. Stardust Crusaders gets a 9 out of 10 from me (Even though I personally give it a 10.)",

            "content": "I've talked about JoJo twice now. The first series and the first series of Stardust Crusaders. So far, it's been an entertaining series full of over the top absurdity and machismo. So, let's recap the first series of Stardust Crusaders and see where we are. Dio Brando returned, with his head attached to Jonathan's body. Thanks to his influence the Joestar line including our protagonist, Joutarou, developed powers called Stands. In order to save his mother, who wasn't strong enough to control her Stand, Joutarou set off on a journey with his grandfather, Joseph, and several other companions; Avdol, Kakyouin & Polnareff. The five madetheir way to Egypt, clashing with Stand users sent by Dio. When we'd left off, they'd taken a submarine and were very close to arriving in Egypt. With the clock running out for Holly, can this group of manly men stop Dio in time? Let's delve into JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken: Stardust Crusaders series 2 and find out.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nWe open with our heroes travelling in the desert when a helicopter from the Speedwagon foundation shows up to drop off a stand user to aid them. This is Iggy, a small black and white dog. Our heroes are also told that Dio's recruited a bunch of other Stand users, these ones with stands based on the Egyptian pantheon instead of the major arcana in tarot. Undeterred, they continue their journey, challenging Dio's stand users with names based off of musicians as they continue to their climactic battle.\\n\\n\r\nAs is the trend in this franchise, the story is pretty light. They encounter a stand user. There's a battle. They get one step closer to Dio until the end when we reach our climactic clash. It's a basic plot and it has all the subtlety of a steam roller. That being said, it works for the whole over the top absurdity that the franchise is going for. The biggest problem with the whole series is that there are some cohesion problems. For example, the way Dio's stand works. We're told it lasts for a specific amount of time, but the characters have an awfully long time to monologue, converse and still act considering the amount of time it's supposed to work. One might even say that there's no conceivable way for them to do all the things they do in the supposed time frame. The effect that Dio's blood has on other people is also inconsistent. The final battle also involves a pretty blatant case of a character gaining a new ability he's never shown any indication of having before. Hooray for plot contrivance.\\n\\n\r\nNow, you can forgive those issues to a degree since the series is more over the top absurdity than serious. And I will credit it, as the other instalments, for being quite good at that. It is an entertaining series to watch and there are some surprisingly good dramatic moments too. Suzi Q visiting her ailing daughter. The scenes where certain major characters die are surprisingly good, given that this isn't a complex cast.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of characters remains very much archetypical but with the occasional moment where they surpass that. JoJo and his amazing friends remains an endearing little band of heroes. Dio is still the least subtle villain since the Abomination. His minions either have no motivation behind serving him or they're serving him because he's strong. The musical artist naming scheme is very much intact. We have such characters as the brothers Oingo & Boingo, Vanilla Ice, the D'arby brothers, Mariah and so on.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nI do like to poke fun at this series a bit for the blokes being over-muscled with abs for days and for having action sequences where posing scenes are an important part, but I have to admit that the style does have its charm. It's the overly macho aesthetic that just suits the series. I'll also continue to give the franchise credit for having a lot of unique, interesting action sequences. Although this particular series loses some credit for putting the focus on Mariah's ass for no reason during her episodes. That's not how class works. Also for having a dog in the main cast but drawing it oddly enough that it's really not cute like an actual dog.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThere's a lot of exaggeration in this series. Throughout most of it, the lines are delivered in a very deliberate, over the top way. The actors can be more subtle at times, especially when dealing with something tragic, but expect a lot of yelling and loud declarations. I will say that both Koyasu Takehito & Ishizuka Unshou excel at going from the over the top ridiculous lines to the quieter, more subdued ones. The soundtrack is pretty decent. It's definitely weaker than the music in the first Stardust Crusaders series, but it's all right.\\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nThe closest you get to ho-yay is a really absurd scene where a couple blokes get stuck together.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nIf you've seen the other two series in the franchise, you know roughly what to expect with this one. Absurd machismo dripping from its every frame. Exaggerated dialogue and performances. Creative, interesting battles. If you're a fan of that kind of aesthetic, you'll probably like it and I can't say I didn't enjoy myself watching it. Although, I didn't like it as much as the first part of Stardust Crusaders. My final rating for JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken: Stardust Crusaders series 2 is going to be a 7/10. And next week I'll be reviewing Drifters.",

            "content": "This is one of the most awesome anime ever created. \r\nWhat an adventure. A story of true friendship and fight against evil in its purest form.\r\nThe villain Dio is probably one of the most greatest villains ever created. Dio is so perfect,that anyone can fall for his handsome looks and charm.When he talks even the most bravest of heroes can't move,that's how he traps them and gets control over them.No one can stop Dio, and he will rule the world. He has many faithful servants that are willing to die for him and are equally evil, as he is. \r\nBut, he needs one thing andone thing only.\\n\r\nTo destroy the Joestars once and for all.\\n\\n\r\nJoseph and his grandson Jotaro need to destroy Dio in order to save Holy. So the mission begins. If you think the Hamon power was cool, wait till you see the Stand Power, because it's the coolest thing you'll ever see. There are many different stands, all interesting in their own way. \\n\\n\r\nThe designs of these stands and the story behind each and every one of them, is just a joy to watch. Entertainment at its highest level. Leaving you wanting more after each episode.The excitement never ends! Full of crazy horror bloody scenes, filled with ton of comedy and joy.\\n\r\nWith a lot of mystery and anticipation what the next stand will be like. \\n\\n\r\nThe old hag stand was so spooky, but when she talks and screams of her revenge, those scenes with Polnareff leave you laughing to the point where, your neighbors will hear you. The dog Iggy will become your favorite after you get to know him better in one of the most amazing episodes ever created, when he encounters an evil guardian. \\n\\n\r\nThe episode when they play games is so much fun, when Jotaro takes of his hat and the old man screaming at him the whole time, because Jotaro doesn't even know how to play the baseball game. Just so much fun.\\n\\n\r\nIn this anime every episode has a story on its own, but always connected to the main plot. Bringing new and exiting characters who all have great original stand powers. Most anime would drag one simple story throughout the whole Season, but not this one. Stardust Crusaders Season 1 and 2 gives you so much more. You are left with a feeling of getting to know so many characters and their own stories.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this adventure is such a rich, powerful, creative, heartwarming story. It will make you laugh,cry, be amazed, and cheer for our heroes. \\n\\n\r\n(OMG!!!!!! I cant forget to mention such style, such fashion and such perfect hairstyles!!!! Such muscles! A girl can just gush over these things lol )\\n\\n\r\nGOOD GRIEF. \\n\\n\r\nP.S. The old man's Sony Walkman looks exactly like my Sony Walkman...Just one of the little details, that makes it so damn nostalgic for me.",

And while dey still be covered up it was still be good enough to \"slam my jam Space Jam to\" dog. All season 1 had was that nurse, and Holly with her stand, oh sorry Joseph I mean Horry. Season 2 had that purple haired hoe Mariah, as well as that one old hoe that wanted to have the fuckings with my boy Joseph, plus the other old hoewho already fucked Joseph, Suzie Q. You could say that the story gets a little bit repetitive but who the hell cares. You know when Miyazaki said that Anime was a mistake, and people said... \"No it's no! A lot of Anime tells amazing stories with compelling characters!\" I think both of those opinions are retarded, unless if by plots and character you mean titties and butts, because Anime was made for man-children like me that have a fetish for beating our super salamis until they bleed to sexy cartoon characters. Anyway though I had many of good faps to this Hentai so I will give it a recommend. I would like to take a minute to thank my home boy Joseph, and all of you for coming out here tonight!!!\\n\\n\r\nFor Real though this second season has most of the positives of the last one; as well as some of it's own, however I do think the first season was still a bit better. I give this season gets a 9 out 10, just like the first season because it's not to far from being as good.",

            "content": "OHHH MY GOOOOD...this is awesome...\r\nJoJo no Kimyou na Bouken: Stardust Crusaders 2nd Season leaves us right where the first season does, and with MORE Stand users and even some allies along the way to Dio. Let's start off with the fact that Dio has more Stand users that bar Jotaro's group from progressing, this time in the form of the 9 Egyptian Glory Gods. On the allies side, a new member joins...Iggy The Fool voiced by Misato Fukuen...a dog...no seriously, if a freakin' orangutan can have a Stand a dog can sooo, anyways he has the ability of shapeshifting sand and he's through the majorityof the journey reluctant to help Jotaro's group and rather protect his own hide than helping others but he gets better over time and yes because we have this kind of character integrated into the group, his punching bag becomes obviously Polnareff. Iggy overall though his screentime was short, his days in the limelight was good to say the least and had the bit of character development from arrogant annoying mutt to loyal companion, he just needed a bit more screentime was all.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the 9 Egyptian Glory Gods Stand users barring Jotaro's group path well LA might as well give the highlights. Divine Geb has shades of Wham from Battle Tendency and first showing that these Egyptian Glory Gods aren't meant to be messed with like the Occultic tarot Stands, HOWEVER Oingo and Boingo were the exact opposite and were the comedic relief and a HUGE hoist of their own petarded. Mariah gives Abdul and Joseph something to do in a weirdly comedic yet serious fight, Alessi was the biggest creep with his Stand powers but gave Polnareff some toilet humor retribution for all the shit (no pun intended) he's been through, D'Arby's fights were AMAZING to say the least and changing up the formula as to how to fight, Pet Shop was the Stand user to give Iggy the limelight which hugely beneficial for Iggy and Vanilla Ice...is a fucking psycho and is probably Dio's MOST loyal servant he's ever had, pales in comparison to the rest of the Egyptian Glory Gods..heck the Occultic Tarot Stands even. Overall, it's hard not to say that the Egyptian Glory Gods though a mixed bag, they CLEARLY showed off that they aren't playing around and will do anything t kill any of the main cast when they get the chance, considering they are ever so close to finding and defeating Dio because of it.\\n\\n\r\nSo with more Stand users in the way means they still have a long way to get to Dio and again like LA said in the first season of Stardust Crusaders that it's the journey NOT the destination and it proves itself even more when the obstacles are even more dangerous and the obstacles themselves ramps up the fighting even further making even their encounters interesting in their own right. \\n\\n\r\nLA had been talking lots about the enemy Stands, how about Jotaro's group, did they develop?. Well yes and no but still works weirdly enough, See Kakyouin gets put on the bench for the first half of the anime thus leveraging Iggy's time and through most of the Stands the group faces well it's like the first season as we find out how the individual or group figure out the enemy Stand and defeat them giving them their screentime they need and showing how badass they are in the process of it, Polnareff once again getting the brunt of it. Abdul and Kakyouin gets his fair share of fighting Stand users and LA aforementioned Iggy's limelight. But Joseph and Jotaro gets the majority of the time fighting Stands this season and especially once they confront Dio...it's another beast altogether.\\n\\n\r\nSo Dio, he's a specter who has been in the shadows of the entire Stardust Crusaders and near the tail end of the season he comes out into the light and begins one of the greatest and craziest fights LA have seen in a VERY long time and heck LA will say that JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken: Stardust Crusaders 2nd Season pushed the bar and risked it even before Dio's true appearance all due to Vanilla Ice and his fight but nonetheless...Dio and Jotaro's fight all culminates into outwitting, gathering information and breaking their own limits over and over again and in this fight though Jotaro has been a VERY inward character, he has shown moments of caring for people or at least showing some sort of emotion and this fight against Dio shows it off not only to save the world, not to save his own mother but his own beliefs in fighting of using anger and rage first, thinking and waiting later but oddly enough KEEPING his beliefs and using it to his advantage as his clutch when facing against Dio. Dio on the other hand is now straight up having a God complex thinking he can live forever if he destroys the Joestar line, ironic as his survival in the first WAS the Joestar line and his Stand, everyone knows it, it's everywhere ZA WARUDO and the concept of manipulating time just made the fight sooo much more interesting and intense it was fucking amazing.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation once again done by David Production is back and holy crap with the more tenser Stand battles means the animation is all the more grander and amazing, they still have the changing color palette making almost every scene or frame interesting and NOT for us to look away from the screen. Backgrounding, character designs, fight scenes and the absolute consistency of the animation is just amazing and LA will mention they keep this up for 24 episodes, it's nothing but a mark of animation brilliance to say the least and let's not even get to Dio's fight as THAT was glorious.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting has the same voice cast back but with Misato Fukuen as Iggy...yeah confused?, Iggy has his own monologue with woof outside it so there is that. LA will quite easily say the two MVP's of this season and that is...Takehito Koyasu and Daisuke Ono as Dio and Jotaro respectively...LA just had to, third runner up would be Unshou Ishizuka as Joseph as he still LA's favorite character...until Jotaro and Dio's fight then...Takehito Koyasu.\\n\\n\r\nLA will say this as some VERY small flaws and that would be near the tail end take JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken: Stardust Crusaders 2nd Season into some risky territory and HUGE spoilers but they had the guts to mercilessly and quickly kill of some of the main cast, sure it might be shock value, effective due to how we get to know them soo well through the journey but damn was it jarring that this season kills off it's characters with a snap of a finger heck the mourning is faaar too short but to this defense, Dio is right there thus they can't but still. LA wouldn't call this a flaw as it was JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken: Stardust Crusaders 2nd Season taking a risk and for the most part was effective.\\n\\n\r\nWith that, the finale gave us one heart pumping, crazy conclusion to it all after the resulting fight of Dio and Jotaro and LA will say it was satisfying as hell and by that extent made BOTH the journey and the destination all the more worth it, sure some VERY risky curveballs came across but nonetheless it didn't tarnish the experience all that much LA hadn't felt this much excitement and adrenaline in watching anime and JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken: Stardust Crusaders 2nd Season and Stardust Crusaders as a whole gave it all in spades with extreme precision, execution and impact...like Star Platinum! that shows off Stardust Crusaders as one of the most famous parts of Jojo's but also how great Jojo's and anime in general is and why LA watches anime in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nJoJo no Kimyou na Bouken: Stardust Crusaders 2nd Season is the conclusion of Stardust Crusaders but there are still more Jojo's and we ALL need more Jojo's in our lives...it's\\n\\n\r\nMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDA",

The episodic fights each have enough to differentiate one another, and part 3 pretty much layed the groundwork for all the later parts, the idea of stand fights being more about brains than brawn. Of course part 3 stand is still kind of too physical, so later parts have stands with more complex and tricky mechanics, but it can be forgiven for this is Araki trying the idea for the first time.\\n\\n\r\nMore interesting is that part 3 showed Araki retconing his own character's abilities at times, this is a trait that is also carried on in the series, as Araki nerfs later MCs when he felt it is too simple.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 6\\n\\n\r\nLikeable and memorable, but shallow in many ways as well, the camaraderie and quirks are shown decently but not much beyond that. The episodic villains are not worth mentioning (only hol horse stand out for being kind of funny), so the only villain worth remembering is Dio.\\n\\n\r\nOverall JJBA part 3's characters are fun, memorable, but also shallow\\n\\n\r\nArt, sound - 8, 8\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8\\n\\n\r\nThe review is quite short, because JJBA is an experience best enjoyed with no idea and judged for yourself, it is full of manliness, creativity and style, but also shallow, moronic and tedious.\\n\\n\r\nSo watch and decide for yourself.",

            "content": "So the second half of Stardust Crusaders starts us off in Cairo, Egpyt where the Joestar's make there way to their most daunting foe, DIO. So i've read the manga from part 4 to 7 (as of right now) so i honestly cannot compare this to the manga. Yet as a fan of Jojo i can tell you the gears start rolling once the second half of SC starts. We're still stricken by the monster-of-the-week trope of a new stand that challenges our protagonists but some of these challenges are personally my favorites. I do still believe some of the encounters with certain stands would'vebeen minimized but nonetheless i had a blast with this batch more than the others. Vanilla Ice, D'arby Younger are great encounters that really showcase the danger that is present when the Joestars and co. are closer to DIO. The art is great, as usual. The designs and color palettes are phenomenal and seriously impress the hell out of me. A lot of work was done for these sequences and i appreciate it. One thing that really impresses me is how Araki can still find a way to make Egypt such an interesting place as it is more barren and dry next to the first half's setting in SC. The ost really brings life to Cairo. As for the op and ed, they couldn't have picked anything better. They seriously encompass the feelings of characters and viewers alike through music. Overall, the second half of SC provides a satisfying end to the original trilogy of Jojo in some of the most stylish and melancholy ways possible.",

In the first season, I wasn't that impressed or interested in Stands and prayed that I'd get used to it by the second season.\r\nThank God, I ended up feeling much more impressed and involved watching this season. The Stand users were much more interested, the narration that was so prevalent in Battle Tendency came around again, there were many touching, tearjerker scenes to be had, there was plenty of humor to keep things light at times, and the climax to the finale was really amazing. As usual,the music, sound, and art were great. I expected nothing less from a JoJo anime.\\n\\n\r\nOf all the seasons of JoJo, I still love Battle Tendency the most, but I think season two of Stardust Crusaders was a close second. Unlike the first season of Stardust Crusaders, which seemed a little slow and clunky, the second season went back to its roots where there was plenty of hype to be had. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Definitely some spoilers, don't read if you don't want to be spoiled.\r\nStory: 3\r\nThe story became very repetitive at this point. Most of the episodes were: Go from current point to next point, encounter enemy Stand user, defeat stand user, repeat until we reach Dio. It became a monster-of-the-week series and it just felt really bland. The fights varied somewhat but in the end I was expecting a little more than what was essentially an RPG grind until you hit max level and go do an end game boss.\r\nArt: 9\r\nThe art style definitely made everything feel more dramatic and dark, while the backgrounds gave a reallygood view of what Egypt looks like (at least from someone who hasn't been there). The characters themselves are very detailed with proper shadings of clothing which makes them look 'realistic'.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nThe op of the first season was really good and it got you pumped up and it made you feel manlier just by listening to it. But this second season's op just reminded me of Rozen Maiden, it doesn't fit. The voice acting is the same as the first season so if you liked it there, you'll like it here, especially hearing Jonathan yell \"AWEEE MAIII GAWDDDDD\" or \"SHIIIIITTTT\".\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5\\n\r\nThe villains felt very cliched in that they're always over the top sadistic with no redeeming qualities. Each one was basically just 'bad guy with certain bad trait' repeated over and over every episode until we got to Dio. \\n\\n\r\nDio - Dio maintains his arrogance and threatening nature which definitely made him feel like an end raid boss and reinforces his antagonistic role.\\n\\n\r\nJoutarou - If you can call standing around, posing 'cool' and saying \"Yare Yare Daze\" as being a character... well... he's a character for you then. Initially, this was kind of cool, the nonchalant, tough without overtness attitude, but after two seasons of this composure, it starts to become dull and repetitive. Any encounters that involve Joutarou is basically resolved before it even begins and all you're left doing is thinking how far his legs are going to be apart this time and how angled is his body going to face.\\n\\n\r\nJonathan - Not as cool as when he was younger with all his predictions but still a staple character that is hilarious when he swears/yells in Engrish. \\n\\n\r\nPolnareff - Basically the comic relief of the show but his character really shines during his emotional moments with his comrades, especially Iggy.\\n\\n\r\nIggy - I initially didn't like him as his existence felt out of place most of the time as he didn't do very much, but in later episodes his character really develops and I liked him near the end. \\n\\n\r\nAvdol - A firm, stable character that really cares for his friends and even sacrifices himself. Things actually happen to him which makes him feel mortal and human.\\n\\n\r\nKakyouin - Really stayed the same from the first season though his bonds with his comrades grows stronger. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nDefinitely wasn't as enjoyable as the first season as the encounters with the other Stand users felt very repetitive and monster-of-the-week. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\r\nAt this point, it just became repetitive until we came to the final showdown between Dio and JoJo.",

            "content": "An action-packed adventure of fun, bizarreness, crazy gimmicks, and dangerous distinction. Jojo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure Stardust Crusaders: Second Season (or Egypt Arc) provokes the question of what the audience wants to see next. The first half of the adaptation already showed plenty of Stands ranging from one that can attack via reflective surfaces, a parasitic being that can enter a victim\u2019s brain, or even a Stand that can attack in dreams with Freddy Krueger style. The answer is simple really. It continuously deliver a source of imaginative and entertainment that almost anyone will find entrancing.\r\nAs a direct continuation of the first season, it\u2019s imperative to watchit before venturing into the Egypt Arc. Otherwise, you\u2019ll be wondering around like a goat in a desert. Propelled by the series\u2019 vision to craft a dynamic adventure, we are introduced to new allies and enemies. Of course, the main cast returns as well including Jotaro, Joseph, Avdol, Kakyoin, and Polnareff. Joining them is a new ally in the form a dog named Iggy. Bringing in non-human characters into a series always presents a challenge but Iggy isn\u2019t just an ordinary house common animal. He has a Stand and there\u2019s even an episode that really brings out his abilities for the audience to see. \\n\\n\r\nBecause the first season has exhausted Dio\u2019s resources and servants, we are introduced to new and more dangerous enemies for the crusaders. Adapting well with its Egyptian theme, these new enemies presents a challenge like never before. We have Big Bads that do all sort of otherworldly things that people can\u2019t even begin to imagine. It really brings a focus to Jotaro and his friends as they struggle to survive. A good measure of the fights not just test them on a physical level either but mentally as well. The D\u2019arby siblings are a good example of this as they rely on trickery and deception to get what they want by pitting their enemies in twisted mind games. Then, there\u2019s also the creativity coming from the brainchild of the series, Hirohiko Araki. The characters he makes not just possess a diverse range of personalities but also has Stands that bring out their sheer tenderness. As daring as some of his ideas are, they work well when it comes to bringing a mixture of thrilling excitement, mystery, and humor.\\n\\n\r\nIndeed, the comedy for the series is like no other. From the artistic style of Boingo\u2019s Tohth to Sethan\u2019s power of age manipulation, there\u2019s almost something in it for everyone to witness. Furthermore, the gimmicks of the show return in full with our main characters\u2019 personalities. They may all have different personalities but their goal in hand is the same \u2013 to save Holly from death. As such, expect the mood of the story to get more and tenser as the journey takes them closer and closer into Dio\u2019s palace. However, there will still be times when the story feels like a \u2018monster of the week\u2019 style. Certain characters also makes reappearances that gives them another chance to shine.  For what\u2019 worth, this second season behaves in a similar way with the first half in conjunction with their journey. Then, the latter half really picks up the pace as we get to the grand stage. Patience is a key to understand and enjoy the show as David Productions is willing to adapt the most important element of the story. To capture that style of Jojo is never easy but adapting with a steady pacing with weekly doses of adventure is something to take granted for. As such, I recommend watching this show in a weekly style rather than a whole marathon. It will leave you wanting for more as each episode brings something new to the table. And when the battle against Dio draws to its climax, you\u2019ll realize that the patience was well worth waiting for.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork of the second season along with its soundtrack remains generally the same but still retains the sense of exhilarating fun. Taking place in Egypt, we get more of the classic Egyptian-like atmosphere with more desert themes involved. As such, expect the soundtrack to reflect a bit of that culture. Opening theme songs are also clear with its choice by orchestrating the classic Jojo style that we should all be familiar with by this point. Surprisingly though, the ED theme songs has a more vibrant and melancholic tune. While seemingly off balance in some sense, I find it to be captivating as it creates a sense of serenity. Finally, there\u2019s also the character voices that each reflect dynamically at how the characters behave. The villains\u2019 textural motives also has a good amount of credible voice mannerisms to make the audience feel what their roles are. Then, there\u2019s the artwork that continuously dedicates itself to capture what this journey been \u2013 crude, dangerous, and insane. However, that\u2019s all in a good way. (minus some editing of the censors) David Productions\u2019 visual standards impresses with their work by delivering stellar landscapes, well-made architectures, and a wealth of character designs to make the audiences awe. Similarly, expect the action to blow you out of the seats with its extensive prowess.\\n\\n\r\nIn a nutshell, the second season is what you will expect and get. And that would be thrilling action packed adventure of non-stop pandemonium. It\u2019s a show that unites all sorts of strange gimmicks to deliver what the audience wants. Assuming that you like stunts, unpredictable characters, mind games, or dynamic comedy, then this season will be quite a looker. Now, this might not be a show for anyone though. There are at times problems when people feel like pacing becomes sour and certain parts from the original source omitted. Or there may be certain characters that get lesser screen time than others. However, the adventure never stop at its mark and packs its bag. Instead, it shows why the series is called Jojo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure. And that is freaking awesome. \\n",

At least for me, not staying up to date is like being dead in this world of anime.\r\nJoJo was one of these trending things, and I tried real hard to ignore it, because  getting myself in the JoJo world would only fatten upmy backlog.

            "content": "The second season of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders is the when all the real stuff of the 3rd part of JoJo manga happens. \r\nIt picks up right where the first season left off and doesn't waste a moment to start doing what Stardust Crusaders does best, and that is episodic, intense, imaginative fights. Not much is changed in the overall sturcture of the show. It still follows the formula of traveling from one place to another, and encountering new enemies on the way in an episodic manner. \r\nThe cream of the entire show are fights, and I am happy to say that the secondseason is where most of the better fights from the manga take place. The fights in the second season are longer and way more intense and imaginative. The fact that unlike the first season, the second one has a define ending, really helps the show too. I honestly think that both season should be judge as one anime show, because they are just a single story, divided in two parts, because it would take too many episdoes to adapt it all in one season.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is still over the top as all and rather silly or dumb at places. Thankfuly it knows when not to take itself seriously and thus the sillyness never really hinders the experience too much.\\n\\n\r\nThis season has a healty dose of fun episodes and moments, is also has a healthy amount of rather touching and sad parts. Some characters get a bit more development, some don't. We also get a new character in the face of Iggy the dog, who is heck lot of fun to watch and really adds to the chemistry of the entire group.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is still awesome looking. The soundtrack is more of the same for the most part, not that there is anything wrong with that. The soundtrack for the first season was really good by itself. Even if the animation itself is pretty static, the design,style and directing make the anime look wonderful.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it is a darn great finale for the adaptation of the third part of the JoJo's Bizarre Adventrue manga. It left me completely satisfied and I really hope they will keep adapting the manga into more seasons of anime. After all the next part: Part 4 Diamond is Unbreakable is really great.",

            "content": "The JoJo series is a very peculiar beast, one ridden with overly muscular super humans, flamboyantly stunning poses, and over-the-top battles that are sure to fill your battle shounen needs. All of these elements are turned up to 11 for Part 3, also known as Stardust Crusaders. While the first season of Stardust Crusaders helped get the ball rolling, the second season had me fully invested, excitedly awaiting my dose of weekly JoJo tomfoolery and badassery.\r\nAdmittedly, I've yet to read or watch Part 1 and 2 of JoJo(as of writing this review) [Update: Caught up through Part 4 of the anime - JoJo fever isin full effect]. I know that seems to throw my merit right out the door, but let me explain! Last year I was in the heat of my anime-watching routine, picking up almost every seasonal show, in an attempt to expand my knowledge of anime and stay up-to-date with current favorites. This of course, was not an easy task, as I quickly drowned in a sea of anime, unable to find enough reason in my wavering heart to drop the shows I only saw as 'okay'. Thus, I became entrapped in a vicious cycle of show-binging, simply to keep up with everything else. But there are always a few diamonds in the rough, and one exceptional outlier starred a highschool boy with the physique of an Olympic athlete and a hat that formed a union with his hair.\\n\\n\r\nJoJo gave me quite the entertaining first impression. The art style and character designs were immediately reminiscent of Fist of the North Star, which was a refreshing difference from the copy-paste character designs I was getting from many other shows on-air. The story arc had been laid out plain and simple within the first few episodes, and while it was nothing exceptionally captivating, I knew already that JoJo was going to be about the journey, not the destination. Week after week, each battle became more and more preposterous, adding new levels of insanity to every consequent duel. JoJo had revealed to me its true nature - it was an outrageous satire of anime past, showcasing every lame catchphrase and ridiculous character tropes from the likes of Fist of the North Star coincidentally. While it was a satire, what made JoJo stand out was its ability to be a really freakin' well-made satire. Catchphrases were cheesy, but hilarious, fight scenes were ludicrous, but thrilling nonetheless. It didn't take long for me to jump on the JoJo train, and soon I couldn't survive the week without seeing their silly, well-toned faces.\\n\\n\r\nSkip to the beginning of 2015. The year has begun anew, and soon to follow suit, another season of JoJo was about to begin. Jotaro and his fellow Stardust Crusaders, Avdol, Kakyoin, Polnareff, Joseph, and Iggy had finally made it to Egypt, the location of their decisive battle against the fabulously immortal vampire Dio. With the majority of the plot setup and character introductions behind us, all that lie ahead was non-stop Stand-on-Stand action. An issue of pacing can arise with a formula built around weekly showdowns (some special one\u2019s made into 2-parters), but Stardust Crusaders handles this excellently with its colorful main cast and a plethora of unique enemies who stand in their way. The Crusaders themselves are one of the best groups I\u2019ve seen in an action show for the past few seasons (I\u2019m looking at you, Kirito and your harem brigade). Each one has distinct personalities and quirks that make their interactions with one another pure gold. \\n\\n\r\nJotaro retains the role of the tough-guy school delinquent, but he\u2019s so physically and mentally calm and collected, that he doesn\u2019t come off as an idiot, which is much appreciated for that type of character. His super-serious attitude can even be hilarious if given the right comedic timing. Joseph Joestar returns quite a bit older from his role in Battle Tendency, but his childish nature still shines through. Joseph is quite the card, responsible for some of the funniest moments in Stardust Crusaders; his infamous \u201cOH MY GOD\u201d engrish reactions are priceless. Muhammad Avdol is very serious and a bit of a caretaker to the rest of the irresponsible adventurers. He acts as a guide and cultural resource for the Joestars as they make their trek through the Middle East. Noriaki Kakyoin is a fellow student of Jotaro\u2019s, and also one of the more serious characters, but he is also very genuine, showing signs of compassion several times throughout the journey. Jean Pierre Polnareff is the unsung hero of Stardust Crusaders, getting just about or maybe even more screen time than even the Joestars. Polnareff is your typical loud-mouth hero, who isn\u2019t afraid to speak his mind and emote as much as he deems appropriate. But underneath his clumsy exterior is a very protective, and passionate warrior. Possibly the most complex of the bunch, his screen time is adequate in proportion to the amount of character development he needed. Lastly there\u2019s Iggy, an abrasive dog, frequently acting on his own accord and staying relatively antisocial. While he is supposed to be with the Crusaders to aid their struggle, he seems to be more of an annoyance, especially to Polnareff, whom Iggy consistently enjoyed terrorizing. Iggy\u2019s worth to the team comes out in small spurts at first, both consciously and unconsciously saving the group without them realizing it most of the time. This is a grade-A main cast, and Stardust Crusaders does each one justice by allotting specific episodic battle to each of them pretty equally, though I wouldn\u2019t have complained if Kakyoin and Avdol got a little more time up front.\\n\\n\r\nEven more entertaining than our heroes is the variety of enemies they face along the way. Perhaps the most enthralling part of JoJo is waiting to see what the next Stand user was going to throw at the Crusaders. There\u2019s basically no limit to the concept of a Stand, so the amount of possible Stands and users is practically endless. We follow the Crusaders as they face a cursed sword who makes a master out of its wielder, wager their souls against a conniving high stakes gambler, and even duke it out with a Stand-using orangutan. If there is one thing JoJo creator Hirohiko Araki does exceptionally well, it is character creation. Every battle felt fresh and exciting. The fights themselves were also very distinct in how they played out. The Oingo Boingo twins clumsily stumbled through their failed Jotaro assassination attempt, which was one of the funniest episodes in the series. On the other hand, the crew\u2019s battle with the High Priestess in the submarine was exhilarating and had me on the edge of my seat. And of course it\u2019s hard to forget the illusionary obstacle created by the Sun Stand, which once figured out, was quickly and amusingly disposed of. While many of them were one-off characters, momentary obstacles only to be replaced in the following episode, a lot of the enemies were very well written and designed, and I found a lot of the charm in JoJo could be discovered through attachments created to these short-lived villains.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I am fond of the macho-man aesthetic of the JoJo universe, it wasn\u2019t the only artistic choice I was keen on observing. The palette swap during some intense fight scenes became a standard affair during the show. The psychedelic color schemes that embodied these moments were a great addition to atmosphere building, the pastel colors representing a state of confusion, letting the viewer know that something quite perplexing was at hand. The use of \u2018unsound effects\u2019 such as the words \u201cmenacing\u201d drifting across the screen are a delightful nod to the manga, and has equal effectiveness in setting up the tone of upcoming showdowns. The show\u2019s direction is on-point during battle sequences, as if each character were aware of their on-screen close-up, they assume theatrically stylish poses as they outwit their opponent. Dramatic pans to full character stitches are expectedly followed up with brief attack explanations or memorable one-liners, avoiding exhaustingly drawn-out details and replacing them with fast paced, concisely explained sequences. Not a moment feels wasted during the show\u2019s combat, keeping my attention indefinitely, eyes glued to the screen the entire time.\\n\\n\r\nOne element of Stardust Crusaders that caught me completely off guard was the quality of the show\u2019s OP\u2019s and ED\u2019s. All four songs are littered with hints about events that occur throughout the season, making their replay value astronomically high; each watch possibly revealing a detail you didn\u2019t catch the previous time. The 3D rendered characters from the OP\u2019s look as if they\u2019ve jumped straight out of JoJo\u2019s All Star Battle videogame; their designs are sleek, and animation is fluid. Both OP\u2019s are successful at instilling hype for each forthcoming episode, especially the special versions of the OP that appear in the last few episodes. While the OP\u2019s can effectively get the blood flowing, the ED\u2019s take a surprisingly relaxed approach. The use of American bands for both songs was a perfect fit for the reference-centric JoJo universe, as Araki is fairly well-known for naming his characters after American musicians. The first song, \u201cWalk Like an Egyptian\u201d by The Bangles is a fairly obvious choice, but an excellent one nonetheless. The second ED choice was much more abstract, but all the more welcomed. \u201cLast Train Home\u201d by Pat Metheny Group is a sobering melody, a lone guitar howls as night falls and our heroes make their grand departure. While the song seems a bit unfit for the episodes that ended with sweat-inducing cliffhangers, it\u2019s the perfect conclusion for some of the more heartfelt episodes, and flawlessly wraps up the season. With this perilous journey behind the Crusaders, \u201cLast Train Home\u201d embodies their peace of mind, leaving a final fleeting moment for reflection and remembrance of the trials they\u2019ve overcome and the memories they\u2019ve made together. (Fun fact: The ED \u201cLast Train Home\u201d introduced me to the wonderful jazz fusion of Pat Metheney, who I have since grown fond of, and I now own a vinyl of his first album, which has \u201cLast Train Home\u201d on it.)\\n\\n\r\nUpon completing Stardust Crusaders, I originally gave it an 8, and began my reviewing process. But after further consideration, and as my review neared its end, I had several realizations which led me to bump my score up to a 9. I realize now that I had ZERO expectations going into JoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure. Having no prior knowledge of its existence and setting no standards for what lie ahead, I was completely blown away by the end of Part 3. An anime I had picked up without a second thought had quickly become one of my favorite shows of the year. Even for the veteran JoJo fan\u2019s Part 3 was handled with extreme care. David Productions really went all out; from the music, to animation, to voice acting, it\u2019s obvious that everyone involved with the project took it to heart, and their collective effort gave us the spectacular escapade that is Stardust Crusaders. \\n\\n\r\nAnd now, it\u2019s about time I catch up on Part 1 and 2. ORA ORA ORA!!!\t\\n",

            "content": "\"Do you remember how many breads you have eaten in your life?\" - Dio Brando.\r\nA journey that will make you laugh....\r\nA journey that will fill you with emotions.....\r\nA journey that will leave you with a feeling of both victory and tragedy.....\r\nA journey that gives you a unique experience and in the end........\r\nleaves you completely satisfied.\r\nThis journey is the thrilling conclusion to Stardust Crusaders. A journey worth remembering and one worth savoring. My dramatical hyping aside, this is the show that separates the fabulous men from.......well the ordinary ones and as the title suggest you won't find anything ordinary here.\r\nLet me start of by saying thatI recently became a fan of Jojo's last year and have never been big into reading manga, so this is isn't going to be a comparison and contrast to that, rather this is going to be me going on about my feelings on the franchise as a whole and how well this stacks up to its first season.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all I think it goes without saying that if you know anything about series such as Fist of the North Star you would know that the foundation of the Jojo's franchise is heavily based up on various plot lines and arcs from the Fist of the North Star. So if you aren't familiar with that series I would highly suggest doing some research into it. I felt this show, having watched the franchise before finishing Fist of the North Star up, had given me a greater appreciation for Fist of the North Star and what it did. What I love about Jojo's Bizarre Adventure however, is how it slowly goes from being a parody series, to an entirely different entity on its own and it IS AWESOME. \\n\\n\r\nFor anyone who has yet to dive into the second half of Stardust Crusaders, not much has changed from the first, outside of the fact that the stakes have been raised significantly, with stands so crazy powerful and bad ass they have blown the first couple out of the water. The series for me is definitely making up for the lack of story elements that were far more present in the Phantom Blood and Battle Tendency story lines.\\n\\n\r\nNow even though there is a lack of story elements within Stardust Crusaders not just in part, but as a whole, they add in more clever intricacies that you may not notice at first. Those constant crazy turns in the series are a HUGE part of the enjoyment factor many will ignore when comparing Stardust Crusaders to its older brothers. While Battle Tendency did have many twist and turns they were ,for the most part, in Joseph's favor, however here it's all fair game. An example of these intricacies is when the characters (good or bad) are in a situation that seems impossible to get out of and there is almost always a work around. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and characters are all still very unique and colorful just as they always have been and there is still a lot of over the top action and violence. The music still has a mix of Rock and Jazz (Though I personally prefer the first half's Intro and Outro). All of this may put off some, but if it does.......what the hell are you doing watching Jojo's Bizarre Adventure in the first place? With all that said if you're a newcomer and only plan on watching the Stardust Crusaders portion of the Jojo's franchise (though I highly suggest against doing so) this is not a bad place to start, you aren't missing a lot of plot points that WON'T be addressed plenty of times over and over in this half.\\n\\n\r\nJojo's Bizarre adventure is a series that you can clearly tell is not only a loving homage, but takes pride in making its own wonderful, creative universe that is far from being a carbon copy of your \" Run-of-the-Mill\" Shonen series. It TRULY does its best to break the trend of what people seem to expect at face value and really that's above and beyond what anyone was asking for to begin with. Regardless of the harsh criticisms it gets due to the existence of its older brothers and even future parts, Stardust Crusaders is definitely a hell of a ride in its on right.\\n\\n\r\nAs it is, Jojo's Bizarre adventure is a great Shonen series and a great action series in general with a great blend of Comedy and awkwardness that unbelievably works with flashy flair-Stardust Crusaders' second half is no different. If you enjoy what you got out of the first 3 seasons, you most likely won't be disappointed. It's a classic epitome of manliness that stands proud along such works as Gurren Lagann, Berserk, Fist of the North Star and others. A race against time and a quest for the ages--- There can only be one word worthy of describing this generational conflict, this tale is truly deserving of being dubbed, \"Epic\". \\n",

            "content": "Stardust Crusaders 2nd Season\r\nThe 2nd season of Stardust Crusaders looked to me that it was focusing more on Polnareff than in 1st season, and at some point i thought the title should be Polnareff's Bizarre Adventure, really, he faced more Stands than anyone, and not just that, he had more interaction with anything and also a lot of animals die, just like always.\r\nStory\r\nLittle improvement from the 1st season, it has almost the same formula of ''the enemy of the week'' with part 1 and part 2 on each enemy but better than 1st season, and much better in the last 8 eps. and it wasless predictable than in 1st season in those last eps. but it has obvious flaws and things unexplained for example Jotaro flying, how could he do that? but it was very good.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation\\n\r\nI like the art style like i stated in previous season, but the 3D parts i didn't like and i feel it could be improved a little, but is great.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe music can be repetitive at times, is the same as the 1st season so i was a little tired and it didn't have a big variety of background music; The OP was meh just like the ED and the VA is great, overall the sound was very good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThe characters improved a little, much better interaction, tho Kakyouin was off the screen since the 1st ep. i never missed him, i forgot that he was a character until he came back and i didn't felt anything at his faith, i never felt his character.\\n\r\n-Jotaro improved a little from last time, he still is a little bland tho.\\n\r\n-Joseph ''JoJo'' Joestar is the same goof as always, a little less this season and i didn't like the fact that he lost in a trick ''fight'' considering that he always had something hidden under his sleeves in B.T. and always spotting the enemies tricks, so i didn't like that.\\n\r\n-Avdol is the same person that cares for others rather his own life.\\n\r\n-Polnareff was the protagonist of this season, he was involved in almost anything and he is more funnier, he and Joseph are the best ones, again.\\n\r\n-Kakyouin is almost not there, he still is inteligent but he wasn't there much time to see a change on him.\\n\r\n-Iggy, the new member of the Joestar group is almost useless all the time because he only wants to have a peaceful life and he doesn't like humans, yes, he's a dog, but he starts to help them when one Stand user wanted to kill him.\\n\r\nThe enemies had interesting Stands, i think they were better than in the 1st season and i think the characters are very good.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nI think i wasn't enjoying at least the first 10 eps. because i thought it was going to be the same untill they finally arrived to the place they were looking and face Dio, i enjoyed a lot from ep. 12 till the last one, and Polnareff and Jotaro the last eps. and specially the ep. where Joseph had magnetism from a woman's Stand and she even felt ''attraction'' for Joseph, those were funny eps. so the enjoyment was there and it was very good.",

            "content": "***SPOILER WARNING***\r\nThis review is going to be comparing stardust crusaders 2nd season with not just the 1st season, but also the prequel to that, with the blood phantom and battle tendency arcs.\r\nStory: 5/10\r\nSadly the story of the 2nd season didn't really develop anything meaningful since the 1st and that resulted in a lot of episodes feeling pretty meaningless. The 1st season has the crew finally arrive in egypt after defeating the woman on the beach with her stand and pretty much every single thing of this whole season of 24 episodes can be summarized with one sentence:\r\n\"The crew search for DIO and repeatedly get inconveniencedby a bunch of people ordered to kill them and eventually after beating all of them, they fight him and win.\"\\n\\n\r\nThat's it. No actual plot twists or anything, just that. So all of the episodes of this season are dedicated to battles and a bunch of them feel really like filler due to how obnoxious some of the characters are, which I'll get into.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art of stardust crusaders in general is fine, though I personally find the art of the blood phantom and battle tendency arcs to be more enjoyable than stardust crusaders. As far as quality is concerned, it has objectively improved along the way regardless of my own preferences.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound quality in general is good, and like the 1st season there's plenty of hilarious yelling from old man joseph, which was extremely enjoyable for a lot of episodes. However, there are some characters with voices that just sucked horribly and they just wouldn't go away! Mondatta comes to mind first, which was one of the \"opponents\" referenced above that made multiple episodes feel like total filler. The voice of this character was comparable to nails on chalkboard.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition to that, I feel the VA was pretty poor for Iggy the dog. It sounded too distant from what a dog barking would actually sound like, enough to the point where it hardly felt like the character was even a dog.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I think about how fun the blood phantom and especially battle tendency arcs were to watch, it really puts it into perspective how much less entertaining JJBA is without speedwagon constantly losing his shit as he's narrating intense moments in the show. There are also way less explosions and it feels the intensity levels overall were botched in stardust crusaders.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion this is where JJBA's stardust crusaders falls short the most, because of multiple different reasons. First let's start with the main protagonists and compare them to the blood phantom and battle tendency arcs.\\n\\n\r\nSo in blood phantom the main protagonist was Jonathan Joestar, first introduced as a loyal and righteous boy with a wealthy background, struggling to cope with life thanks to DIO's invasion and grows up to become a hero, becoming manlier and braver as the episodes pass. He has actual character development and as such is very likeable as a protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nThen the battle tendency arc comes about and we're introduced to the grandson of Jonathan, Joseph Joestar. This has to be BY FAR the best protagonist of JJBA. He's hilarious, clever, strong as fuck, brave, quick-thinking, and full of surprises and entertainment from start to finish of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThen when we get to stardust crusaders it all falls apart. Joseph at this point is an old man, so the spotlight is mainly given to his grandson Jotaro Kujo. See, there's literally NO character development whatsoever with Jotaro. The moment he's introduced into the series, his personality is the exact same throughout both seasons 1 and 2 and he's never at any point more interesting than his grandpa was at his age. Is he a badass? Sure, of course. He has his moments in the show where he outwits his opponents and pulls out some awesome finishes but there's only so much you can do with that before everything feels the exact same.\\n\\n\r\nThe other protagonists are where it *really* went to shit, however. The forced deaths of Avdol in season 1 and season 2, in addition to Kakyoin's, were so pointless and obnoxious in my opinion because it felt as if there was literally no way to make the fight with DIO interesting enough as it was without forcing some of the main characters to die to make it seem more serious than it actually is. I personally was fine with Iggy being discarded because he was pretty much only added as a comedic aspect to the show and ended up being more annoying than he was funny, imho.\\n\\n\r\nNow we're left with the antagonists. The entire time, everything was centered around DIO, who we remember as the main enemy of blood phantom that caused Jonathan to die, so we are immediately interested from the start of season 1 to see how the story will play out and to see more action like that! Yeah! ... no.\\n\\n\r\nWe hardly see DIO *at all* for the whole 48 episodes of stardust crusaders... until the last 4 episodes of season 2. He was the only opponent of season 2 that wasn't a joke honestly and with all of the crazy obscure shit that the stand users pulled off in both seasons 1 and 2 you're expecting something INTENSE for DIO to have when the crew finally finds him in egypt, right?\\n\\n\r\nWell his stand is literally just the same as Jotaro's with strength/precision and he can stop time for a few seconds. While that's obviously powerful, it feels like such a cheap trick... it's so unexciting and so much less mighty and god-like that I expected and made him seem so much less powerful than I believed him to be... and sure enough, he dies pretty easily at the hands of Jotaro anyways. Clearly the author of this had a lapse of creativity here because this was a pretty big letdown for me.\\n\\n\r\nAs an antagonist, DIO in stardust crusaders was so much less sinister than he was in the blood phantom arc and you can't even compare him to how terrifyingly powerful and threatening to humanity that the pillar men were in the battle tendency arc.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nDespite my gripes with stardust crusaders, I still found it entertaining enough to watch. There were some episodes that were a lot more interesting than others, such as D'arby the poker player that Jotaro defeated. I also found the episodes with old man Joseph getting into trouble with the magnetic force stand user HILARIOUS. I couldn't stop laughing at his terrified yelling!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe stardust crusaders seasons are worth watching but in terms of story and character development and overall enjoyment it absolutely fell short for me compared to the preceding arcs.",

            "content": "Now I'm going to let you know in advance that Stardust Crusaders is my favorite manga of all time. So I'm a little biased toward it and it's anime adaptation but I am going to write a review to the best of my abilities taking this into consideration.\r\nWhat is the beast called Jojo's Bizarre Adventure you ask? If you're looking at this with no prior experience with the series you should go watch Jojo's Bizarre Adventure (2012) which is an adaptation of the first two parts you need to watch! Jojo's is a legendary manga series that spans many genres of manga including Shounen, Seinen,Slice of Life and so on and so forth. It's definitely worth a read. Today we're going to be talking about the anime adaptation of the most iconic part in the series to date, Stardust Crusaders. \\n\\n\r\nStory: Now the story for Stardust is fairly simple but it works and is enjoyable, tough delinquent Jotaro Kujo has locked himself in prison to protect his mother from what he deems an evil spirit. Holly, his mother, along with Joseph Joestar and Muhammad Avdol come to bail him out. This is where he discovers he has an ability linked to him called a \"stand\" which are spirits that have many different abilities that you'll see later in the adventure. When Jotaro arrives home, his mother Holly falls down ill because of the stand she begins to develop and the gang discovers that the only way to save Holly is to defeat DIO who has developed a super powerful stand of his own. (who you should know from the previous series) This is when Jotaro Kujo, Joseph Joestar, Muhammad Avdol and Kakyoin Noriaki decide that they have to set off to Egypt to find and finally kill DIO once and for all. The story is serviceable but what really makes Crusaders special is the off the wall fights that take place, ESPECIALLY in the second season. Look out for the D'arby brothers, Vanilla Ice and DIO's specifically. \\n\\n\r\nArt: The art of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure is very unique, unlike anything I've ever seen before and honestly that's the only reason it's so high. Vibrant colors and amazing character designs make every scene a delight to watch. NOW onto the cons, the animation is awful. It's seriously almost like a slideshow at times, the bright colors and palette swaps are what makes it special. Some panels look VERY ugly which is to be expected of most anime at this point. \\n\\n\r\nSound: The OST for SDC is probably one of the strongest points. The intros, Stand Proud and Sono Chi No Kioku having amazing animations and are just great songs in general. They'll be stuck in your head for a long time even if they aren't as good as Sono Chi No Sadame. The sound design is very good too, the sound effects that come with Star Platinum's punches are all satisfying. ***SPOILERS*** When DIO's stand, the World, activates it's time stop there's another amazing sound effect that sounds like, for lack of a better explanation, wubs from a dubstep song. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Now onto the strongest part of Jojo's as a whole, the characters. The entire cast of Stardust Crusaders are colorful and entertaining characters. Jotaro Kujo and Jean Pierre Polnareff are two of my favorites. The stern bancho wearing thug Jotaro is a perfect match with his mentor and grandfather Joseph. Jean Pierre Polnareff serves as both comic relief and a pillar to the crew as a whole as he's one of the strongest fighters present. The returning and older Joseph, Kakyoin and Iggy are also fan favorites. These guys make the experience twenty times better and you'll miss them by time this part/arc ends. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: While fan reception of this part is mixed, you're bound to enjoy the intense action, funny/memorable characters and unique art. Give the first two parts a try and if you enjoyed them, move right on to part 3. Stardust Crusaders gets a 9 out of 10 from me (Even though I personally give it a 10.)",

            "content": "I've talked about JoJo twice now. The first series and the first series of Stardust Crusaders. So far, it's been an entertaining series full of over the top absurdity and machismo. So, let's recap the first series of Stardust Crusaders and see where we are. Dio Brando returned, with his head attached to Jonathan's body. Thanks to his influence the Joestar line including our protagonist, Joutarou, developed powers called Stands. In order to save his mother, who wasn't strong enough to control her Stand, Joutarou set off on a journey with his grandfather, Joseph, and several other companions; Avdol, Kakyouin & Polnareff. The five madetheir way to Egypt, clashing with Stand users sent by Dio. When we'd left off, they'd taken a submarine and were very close to arriving in Egypt. With the clock running out for Holly, can this group of manly men stop Dio in time? Let's delve into JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken: Stardust Crusaders series 2 and find out.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nWe open with our heroes travelling in the desert when a helicopter from the Speedwagon foundation shows up to drop off a stand user to aid them. This is Iggy, a small black and white dog. Our heroes are also told that Dio's recruited a bunch of other Stand users, these ones with stands based on the Egyptian pantheon instead of the major arcana in tarot. Undeterred, they continue their journey, challenging Dio's stand users with names based off of musicians as they continue to their climactic battle.\\n\\n\r\nAs is the trend in this franchise, the story is pretty light. They encounter a stand user. There's a battle. They get one step closer to Dio until the end when we reach our climactic clash. It's a basic plot and it has all the subtlety of a steam roller. That being said, it works for the whole over the top absurdity that the franchise is going for. The biggest problem with the whole series is that there are some cohesion problems. For example, the way Dio's stand works. We're told it lasts for a specific amount of time, but the characters have an awfully long time to monologue, converse and still act considering the amount of time it's supposed to work. One might even say that there's no conceivable way for them to do all the things they do in the supposed time frame. The effect that Dio's blood has on other people is also inconsistent. The final battle also involves a pretty blatant case of a character gaining a new ability he's never shown any indication of having before. Hooray for plot contrivance.\\n\\n\r\nNow, you can forgive those issues to a degree since the series is more over the top absurdity than serious. And I will credit it, as the other instalments, for being quite good at that. It is an entertaining series to watch and there are some surprisingly good dramatic moments too. Suzi Q visiting her ailing daughter. The scenes where certain major characters die are surprisingly good, given that this isn't a complex cast.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of characters remains very much archetypical but with the occasional moment where they surpass that. JoJo and his amazing friends remains an endearing little band of heroes. Dio is still the least subtle villain since the Abomination. His minions either have no motivation behind serving him or they're serving him because he's strong. The musical artist naming scheme is very much intact. We have such characters as the brothers Oingo & Boingo, Vanilla Ice, the D'arby brothers, Mariah and so on.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nI do like to poke fun at this series a bit for the blokes being over-muscled with abs for days and for having action sequences where posing scenes are an important part, but I have to admit that the style does have its charm. It's the overly macho aesthetic that just suits the series. I'll also continue to give the franchise credit for having a lot of unique, interesting action sequences. Although this particular series loses some credit for putting the focus on Mariah's ass for no reason during her episodes. That's not how class works. Also for having a dog in the main cast but drawing it oddly enough that it's really not cute like an actual dog.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThere's a lot of exaggeration in this series. Throughout most of it, the lines are delivered in a very deliberate, over the top way. The actors can be more subtle at times, especially when dealing with something tragic, but expect a lot of yelling and loud declarations. I will say that both Koyasu Takehito & Ishizuka Unshou excel at going from the over the top ridiculous lines to the quieter, more subdued ones. The soundtrack is pretty decent. It's definitely weaker than the music in the first Stardust Crusaders series, but it's all right.\\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nThe closest you get to ho-yay is a really absurd scene where a couple blokes get stuck together.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nIf you've seen the other two series in the franchise, you know roughly what to expect with this one. Absurd machismo dripping from its every frame. Exaggerated dialogue and performances. Creative, interesting battles. If you're a fan of that kind of aesthetic, you'll probably like it and I can't say I didn't enjoy myself watching it. Although, I didn't like it as much as the first part of Stardust Crusaders. My final rating for JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken: Stardust Crusaders series 2 is going to be a 7/10. And next week I'll be reviewing Drifters.",

A story of true friendship and fight against evil in its purest form.\r\nThe villain Dio is probably one of the most greatest villains ever created. Dio is so perfect,that anyone can fall for his handsome looks and charm.When he talks even the most bravest of heroes can't move,that's how he traps them and gets control over them.No one can stop Dio, and he will rule the world. He has many faithful servants that are willing to die for him and are equally evil, as he is. \r\nBut, he needs one thing andone thing only.\\n\r\nTo destroy the Joestars once and for all.\\n\\n\r\nJoseph and his grandson Jotaro need to destroy Dio in order to save Holy. So the mission begins. If you think the Hamon power was cool, wait till you see the Stand Power, because it's the coolest thing you'll ever see. There are many different stands, all interesting in their own way. \\n\\n\r\nThe designs of these stands and the story behind each and every one of them, is just a joy to watch. Entertainment at its highest level. Leaving you wanting more after each episode.The excitement never ends! Full of crazy horror bloody scenes, filled with ton of comedy and joy.\\n\r\nWith a lot of mystery and anticipation what the next stand will be like. \\n\\n\r\nThe old hag stand was so spooky, but when she talks and screams of her revenge, those scenes with Polnareff leave you laughing to the point where, your neighbors will hear you. The dog Iggy will become your favorite after you get to know him better in one of the most amazing episodes ever created, when he encounters an evil guardian. \\n\\n\r\nThe episode when they play games is so much fun, when Jotaro takes of his hat and the old man screaming at him the whole time, because Jotaro doesn't even know how to play the baseball game. Just so much fun.\\n\\n\r\nIn this anime every episode has a story on its own, but always connected to the main plot. Bringing new and exiting characters who all have great original stand powers. Most anime would drag one simple story throughout the whole Season, but not this one. Stardust Crusaders Season 1 and 2 gives you so much more. You are left with a feeling of getting to know so many characters and their own stories.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this adventure is such a rich, powerful, creative, heartwarming story. It will make you laugh,cry, be amazed, and cheer for our heroes. \\n\\n\r\n(OMG!!!!!! I cant forget to mention such style, such fashion and such perfect hairstyles!!!! Such muscles! A girl can just gush over these things lol )\\n\\n\r\nGOOD GRIEF. \\n\\n\r\nP.S. The old man's Sony Walkman looks exactly like my Sony Walkman...Just one of the little details, that makes it so damn nostalgic for me.",

And while dey still be covered up it was still be good enough to \"slam my jam Space Jam to\" dog. All season 1 had was that nurse, and Holly with her stand, oh sorry Joseph I mean Horry. Season 2 had that purple haired hoe Mariah, as well as that one old hoe that wanted to have the fuckings with my boy Joseph, plus the other old hoewho already fucked Joseph, Suzie Q. You could say that the story gets a little bit repetitive but who the hell cares. You know when Miyazaki said that Anime was a mistake, and people said... \"No it's no! A lot of Anime tells amazing stories with compelling characters!\" I think both of those opinions are retarded, unless if by plots and character you mean titties and butts, because Anime was made for man-children like me that have a fetish for beating our super salamis until they bleed to sexy cartoon characters. Anyway though I had many of good faps to this Hentai so I will give it a recommend. I would like to take a minute to thank my home boy Joseph, and all of you for coming out here tonight!!!\\n\\n\r\nFor Real though this second season has most of the positives of the last one; as well as some of it's own, however I do think the first season was still a bit better. I give this season gets a 9 out 10, just like the first season because it's not to far from being as good.",

From a short time Jojo fan who got into the series in the summer of 2015.\r\nA LOT better from the previous season, this part has some of the most interesting and nail biting arcs so far from the previous 2 parts. It sometimes tends to have the same problems as the previous season, but it makes up for it at least for the viewers to see the conclusion to the part. \r\nIf you've seen season one of SDC and do not wish tocontinue because you think it's going to stay the same - it's not, it's a lot better.",

            "content": "OHHH MY GOOOOD...this is awesome...\r\nJoJo no Kimyou na Bouken: Stardust Crusaders 2nd Season leaves us right where the first season does, and with MORE Stand users and even some allies along the way to Dio. Let's start off with the fact that Dio has more Stand users that bar Jotaro's group from progressing, this time in the form of the 9 Egyptian Glory Gods. On the allies side, a new member joins...Iggy The Fool voiced by Misato Fukuen...a dog...no seriously, if a freakin' orangutan can have a Stand a dog can sooo, anyways he has the ability of shapeshifting sand and he's through the majorityof the journey reluctant to help Jotaro's group and rather protect his own hide than helping others but he gets better over time and yes because we have this kind of character integrated into the group, his punching bag becomes obviously Polnareff. Iggy overall though his screentime was short, his days in the limelight was good to say the least and had the bit of character development from arrogant annoying mutt to loyal companion, he just needed a bit more screentime was all.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the 9 Egyptian Glory Gods Stand users barring Jotaro's group path well LA might as well give the highlights. Divine Geb has shades of Wham from Battle Tendency and first showing that these Egyptian Glory Gods aren't meant to be messed with like the Occultic tarot Stands, HOWEVER Oingo and Boingo were the exact opposite and were the comedic relief and a HUGE hoist of their own petarded. Mariah gives Abdul and Joseph something to do in a weirdly comedic yet serious fight, Alessi was the biggest creep with his Stand powers but gave Polnareff some toilet humor retribution for all the shit (no pun intended) he's been through, D'Arby's fights were AMAZING to say the least and changing up the formula as to how to fight, Pet Shop was the Stand user to give Iggy the limelight which hugely beneficial for Iggy and Vanilla Ice...is a fucking psycho and is probably Dio's MOST loyal servant he's ever had, pales in comparison to the rest of the Egyptian Glory Gods..heck the Occultic Tarot Stands even. Overall, it's hard not to say that the Egyptian Glory Gods though a mixed bag, they CLEARLY showed off that they aren't playing around and will do anything t kill any of the main cast when they get the chance, considering they are ever so close to finding and defeating Dio because of it.\\n\\n\r\nSo with more Stand users in the way means they still have a long way to get to Dio and again like LA said in the first season of Stardust Crusaders that it's the journey NOT the destination and it proves itself even more when the obstacles are even more dangerous and the obstacles themselves ramps up the fighting even further making even their encounters interesting in their own right. \\n\\n\r\nLA had been talking lots about the enemy Stands, how about Jotaro's group, did they develop?. Well yes and no but still works weirdly enough, See Kakyouin gets put on the bench for the first half of the anime thus leveraging Iggy's time and through most of the Stands the group faces well it's like the first season as we find out how the individual or group figure out the enemy Stand and defeat them giving them their screentime they need and showing how badass they are in the process of it, Polnareff once again getting the brunt of it. Abdul and Kakyouin gets his fair share of fighting Stand users and LA aforementioned Iggy's limelight. But Joseph and Jotaro gets the majority of the time fighting Stands this season and especially once they confront Dio...it's another beast altogether.\\n\\n\r\nSo Dio, he's a specter who has been in the shadows of the entire Stardust Crusaders and near the tail end of the season he comes out into the light and begins one of the greatest and craziest fights LA have seen in a VERY long time and heck LA will say that JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken: Stardust Crusaders 2nd Season pushed the bar and risked it even before Dio's true appearance all due to Vanilla Ice and his fight but nonetheless...Dio and Jotaro's fight all culminates into outwitting, gathering information and breaking their own limits over and over again and in this fight though Jotaro has been a VERY inward character, he has shown moments of caring for people or at least showing some sort of emotion and this fight against Dio shows it off not only to save the world, not to save his own mother but his own beliefs in fighting of using anger and rage first, thinking and waiting later but oddly enough KEEPING his beliefs and using it to his advantage as his clutch when facing against Dio. Dio on the other hand is now straight up having a God complex thinking he can live forever if he destroys the Joestar line, ironic as his survival in the first WAS the Joestar line and his Stand, everyone knows it, it's everywhere ZA WARUDO and the concept of manipulating time just made the fight sooo much more interesting and intense it was fucking amazing.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation once again done by David Production is back and holy crap with the more tenser Stand battles means the animation is all the more grander and amazing, they still have the changing color palette making almost every scene or frame interesting and NOT for us to look away from the screen. Backgrounding, character designs, fight scenes and the absolute consistency of the animation is just amazing and LA will mention they keep this up for 24 episodes, it's nothing but a mark of animation brilliance to say the least and let's not even get to Dio's fight as THAT was glorious.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting has the same voice cast back but with Misato Fukuen as Iggy...yeah confused?, Iggy has his own monologue with woof outside it so there is that. LA will quite easily say the two MVP's of this season and that is...Takehito Koyasu and Daisuke Ono as Dio and Jotaro respectively...LA just had to, third runner up would be Unshou Ishizuka as Joseph as he still LA's favorite character...until Jotaro and Dio's fight then...Takehito Koyasu.\\n\\n\r\nLA will say this as some VERY small flaws and that would be near the tail end take JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken: Stardust Crusaders 2nd Season into some risky territory and HUGE spoilers but they had the guts to mercilessly and quickly kill of some of the main cast, sure it might be shock value, effective due to how we get to know them soo well through the journey but damn was it jarring that this season kills off it's characters with a snap of a finger heck the mourning is faaar too short but to this defense, Dio is right there thus they can't but still. LA wouldn't call this a flaw as it was JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken: Stardust Crusaders 2nd Season taking a risk and for the most part was effective.\\n\\n\r\nWith that, the finale gave us one heart pumping, crazy conclusion to it all after the resulting fight of Dio and Jotaro and LA will say it was satisfying as hell and by that extent made BOTH the journey and the destination all the more worth it, sure some VERY risky curveballs came across but nonetheless it didn't tarnish the experience all that much LA hadn't felt this much excitement and adrenaline in watching anime and JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken: Stardust Crusaders 2nd Season and Stardust Crusaders as a whole gave it all in spades with extreme precision, execution and impact...like Star Platinum! that shows off Stardust Crusaders as one of the most famous parts of Jojo's but also how great Jojo's and anime in general is and why LA watches anime in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nJoJo no Kimyou na Bouken: Stardust Crusaders 2nd Season is the conclusion of Stardust Crusaders but there are still more Jojo's and we ALL need more Jojo's in our lives...it's\\n\\n\r\nMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDA",

The episodic fights each have enough to differentiate one another, and part 3 pretty much layed the groundwork for all the later parts, the idea of stand fights being more about brains than brawn. Of course part 3 stand is still kind of too physical, so later parts have stands with more complex and tricky mechanics, but it can be forgiven for this is Araki trying the idea for the first time.\\n\\n\r\nMore interesting is that part 3 showed Araki retconing his own character's abilities at times, this is a trait that is also carried on in the series, as Araki nerfs later MCs when he felt it is too simple.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 6\\n\\n\r\nLikeable and memorable, but shallow in many ways as well, the camaraderie and quirks are shown decently but not much beyond that. The episodic villains are not worth mentioning (only hol horse stand out for being kind of funny), so the only villain worth remembering is Dio.\\n\\n\r\nOverall JJBA part 3's characters are fun, memorable, but also shallow\\n\\n\r\nArt, sound - 8, 8\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8\\n\\n\r\nThe review is quite short, because JJBA is an experience best enjoyed with no idea and judged for yourself, it is full of manliness, creativity and style, but also shallow, moronic and tedious.\\n\\n\r\nSo watch and decide for yourself.",

            "content": "So the second half of Stardust Crusaders starts us off in Cairo, Egpyt where the Joestar's make there way to their most daunting foe, DIO. So i've read the manga from part 4 to 7 (as of right now) so i honestly cannot compare this to the manga. Yet as a fan of Jojo i can tell you the gears start rolling once the second half of SC starts. We're still stricken by the monster-of-the-week trope of a new stand that challenges our protagonists but some of these challenges are personally my favorites. I do still believe some of the encounters with certain stands would'vebeen minimized but nonetheless i had a blast with this batch more than the others. Vanilla Ice, D'arby Younger are great encounters that really showcase the danger that is present when the Joestars and co. are closer to DIO. The art is great, as usual. The designs and color palettes are phenomenal and seriously impress the hell out of me. A lot of work was done for these sequences and i appreciate it. One thing that really impresses me is how Araki can still find a way to make Egypt such an interesting place as it is more barren and dry next to the first half's setting in SC. The ost really brings life to Cairo. As for the op and ed, they couldn't have picked anything better. They seriously encompass the feelings of characters and viewers alike through music. Overall, the second half of SC provides a satisfying end to the original trilogy of Jojo in some of the most stylish and melancholy ways possible.",

In the first season, I wasn't that impressed or interested in Stands and prayed that I'd get used to it by the second season.\r\nThank God, I ended up feeling much more impressed and involved watching this season. The Stand users were much more interested, the narration that was so prevalent in Battle Tendency came around again, there were many touching, tearjerker scenes to be had, there was plenty of humor to keep things light at times, and the climax to the finale was really amazing. As usual,the music, sound, and art were great. I expected nothing less from a JoJo anime.\\n\\n\r\nOf all the seasons of JoJo, I still love Battle Tendency the most, but I think season two of Stardust Crusaders was a close second. Unlike the first season of Stardust Crusaders, which seemed a little slow and clunky, the second season went back to its roots where there was plenty of hype to be had. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "JJBA does it again, even better than the first two parts. Sometimes called \"Part 3.5\" in the community (or so I have seen) this was a great extension to the original Stardust Crusaders season. Actually, it's even better. So I'll be going over part by part, what I liked about it. This is more a a recommendation type review, but there will be light spoilers. All, I kinda think you should read my other JJBA reviews before this one (but ya don't have to). So let's begin now!\r\n/STORY- 8 OUTTA 10 DUWA-\\\r\nNo, not Duwangs, because before anything, I have to get this out of theway: for you JJBA newcomers, this is NOT I repeat NOT part 4. It's an extension of the original Stardust Crusaders series. And the extension itself isn't called part 4. This is still part 3. I've heard it called 3.5 before so I'll probably refer to it as that, just so you don't get confused.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is relatively the same as last time. The group is still on the journey to Egypt, and they finally get there this time. Of course, there's plenty of new enemy stand users to come after them. I obviously still really liked the Stand aspect. I actually think the stand powers were better in this part- like stands like (I'm about to name my favorites) Anubis, Atum, The World, Sethan, and Thoth (simply to name a few) were better than ones in the first half. Therefore, I enjoyed it more.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the rest of the story, each situation put out for the heroes were seeming more unique than the last. And it got even more, well, bizarre. Like for example, Atum, the video game stand. I loved that episode, one of my favorites. The situations got more interesting- I had said last time I found part 3 boring- this second season is MUCH more engaging.\\n\\n\r\n/ART- 9 DIOOOOOO OUTTA 10\\\\n\\n\r\nThis isn't really anything I hadn't said now twice before- the JJBA art style is different but good. It definitely isn't a style that comes to mind when I hear 'anime'. One thing I MUST say that I didn't say before was that the stand designs got better. DIO came back, and I really liked his design. It really was what was being built up to. And yadda yadda, the art style is easy to get used to for some, nothing I haven't said twice.\\n\\n\r\n/SOUND- 10 IT'S-THE-END-OF-THE-WORLDS OUTTA 10\\\\n\\n\r\nSo last time I had said that Stand Proud was probably one of the weakest OPs for this series in my mind, but this one made up for it, with out a doubt. This JJBA OP is my favorite one. (2nd being CNBT) Like, I would listen to this without JJBA. It fit the mood perfectly, just like the other ones. It shows that it's coming to an end, and there's a storm warning- something big is coming.\\n\\n\r\nEven if you don't plan on watching this show, look up this song.\\n\\n\r\nNow the ED- Last Train Home- was quite the surprise for me. I used to love that song as a young kid (6-7 years) and to hear it again, especially in something unexpected like this, was beautiful. Probably just bias, but it's a great song too.\\n\\n\r\nEven if you don't plan on watching this show, look up this song. Again.\\n\\n\r\n/CHARACTER- 9 IGGY OUTTA 10\\\\n\\n\r\nAlright I'm going to go over only the new characters since there's no point in doing it again.\\n\\n\r\nIGGY: He's a dog. A dog with character development and emotions. And a stand. I really liked him, almost as much as Polernaff. Almost.\\n\\n\r\nDIO: DIO is the main villain, and he finally shows his face. He's the same maniac he was in part 1, just now he has a stand. Oh, and Jonathan's body. Did I mention that before?\\n\\n\r\nTbh that's it for the important characters. Everyone else I mentioned in the other review. The individual villains were more memorable too this time around- in the first half, I forgot who a lot of them were. But this time around we got some intersting people- Telence, Alessi, the Oingo Boingo Brothers, and Mariah- just to name a few.\\n\\n\r\n/ENJOYMENT- 9 EGYPTS OUTTA 10\\\\n\\n\r\nAlright, so I enjoyed this part more than any of the other JJBA parts so far. I finally felt like I had come to the 'meat' of JJBA- what everyone was talking about. I felt excited to watch the next episode every time- unlike in the first half. Probably since it wasn't as boring! In fact, it wasn't boring at all! There was constant action. The characters got more development. I finally felt as if, I myself, had finally arrived at my destination! \\n\\n\r\nSo what else can I say? This was a shorter review since it's stuff I've said only 3 times before. By DIU review will probably longer since it's a new part. But do I reccomend you watch SC/Part 3.5? No, actually. Not without seeing any JJBA. I said last time that you should (and can) watch the SC first part without watching any other JJBA material. I actually know someone who did it. But y pou have to see the rest of Jojo to like this second half. And if you like Jojo, you will.\\n\\n\r\nSo I'll see you next time in Morioh!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

It follows the same script to the end, and this can be bad, because the first episodes, continue the same repetition: something bizarre is happening, this must be the work of an enemy stand, we face the enemy, we defeat him, and so it repeats, BUT, not in the final stretch. When the climax of the Dio arrives, it totally changes the forms of the fights, some characters have more emotions shown, the story gains a greater weight with the sacrificeof some.\\n\r\nThe ending, is typical of many parts of Jojo's, well accelerated, but in the anime is well done, with the friends farewell and the conclusion.\\n\r\nIt is not a fantastic story, it is not something sensational, it is a good story, which is more in the middle. Do not treat SC like a masterpiece, and do not treat it like it's a bad thing, it's not.\\n\r\nArt and sound: Despite the censorship, the art is still nice different, well designed by the animators, the colors are beautiful, combine with the anime and characters.\\n\r\nSound: here the soundtracks take a step, really, are much better, see the OST's of the final battle, the theme of some characters, the sad songs during dramatic scenes.\\n\r\nIt is worth remembering that the sound effects of PD remain wonderful and pleasant. (ZA WARUDO)\\n\r\nCharacters: Well, although the Stardust characters are the most striking of all the others, especially their personalities, and reactions to strained and funny scenes, we have to admit that they are not deep, and this is not a big problem, the biggest , is that they do not have significant development, not even Jotaro. Some are exceptions, such as Iggy, Polnaref.\\n\r\nI do not consider them bad, but they are characters who could have been more worked and developed.\\n\r\nFinal opinion: Stardust Crusaders, serves as introduction to the Stands, back previous characters, has a unique experience that is passed to the viewer. Despite having hilarious scenes, charismatic characters, intense fights, a good sound and visual production, I do not feel at all comfortable saying that it is a masterpiece. Honestly, even if you are a fan of Jojo's, or even passionate about the work, do not put this anime as the best part of Jojo's, and I'm not talking about the relative point, but the goal. SC is fun, and despite the flaws, it's worth watching, but do not overestimate the work, just because you've laughed with the characters, or something.\\n\r\nFinal: it is a medium work, a little above average, has incredibly creative and original struggles and confrontations. It has charismatic characters, a pleasant mood to most, good production.\\n\r\nIt is not a masterpiece of animes, but without doubt, it is remarkable for almost everyone who opens up to new experiences.\\n",

            "content": "Lets start this review with high action because that's the only appropriate way to review Jojo. Flashback to me 3 months ago maybe, I didn't understand the Jojo hype, there had to be something special about it because everyone I knew who was a fan was a fanatic. There's not a lot of moderation for Jojo, you either haven't watched it, don't like it, or you're absolutely obsessed with it. I of course knew I had to eventually see what this was all about, I didn't know what to expect because though I did know a little about the show the fan base or atleast the friends that I have in it were thankfully very stingy with their spoilers. \\n\\n\r\nI began my journey in the logical way with Phantom Blood, I watched it with sharp eyes and iron clad judgement, keeping my eye out for what it was that supposedly made this anime so special. In hindsight it was a mistake, I was thinking about it too much and I know I would have enjoyed it more had I just went in to it like any other anime. Not as to say that I didn't like it, I just couldn't figure out for the life of me what separated it from the rest of the herd. Phantom Blood ended with a bang and while I felt the end was gratifying, the satisfaction of it was almost ruined by my expectations, but as luck would have it that's also kept me watching, I had to know what it was that everyone loved about Jojo and I still couldn't put my finger on it. \\n\\n\r\nBattle Tendency hit me like a ton of bricks, with the charming, lovable, Joseph and his antics. The story took a darker turn that I was into, and seeing these new characters and their connections to the characters in the previous arc felt awesome; I truly felt like I was there witnessing history. I was starting to catch the fever, and its a fever you can't sweat out. By the end of Battle Tendency I finally got it, it was super clear to me that Jojo was anime in its purest form, despite its violence and gore and dark story I felt like Jojo was wholesome? Jojo isn't hunkered down with pretension, it doesn't insist upon its own way, it isn't trying too hard to be anything in particular, it's JUST Jojo. It was at this point I knew I liked this series, in my life filled with so much chaos and anxiety and sadness, Jojo was a place I could go to escape, as cliche as that sounds, I could forget the failure I see myself as and watch manly men overcome every obstacle and defy fate itself to do what needs to be done. I loved seeing this because I feel like i have so little power in my life. Needless to say this was just the tip of the iceberg.\\n\\n\r\nI said previously that Battle Tendency is when I knew I liked Jojo, that being said, Stardust Crusaders is when I knew I LOVED Jojo. They took everything that was great about battle tendency and cranked in up to 11. I didn't ever wanna stop watching, I was more concerned with Jojo than I was with my own life. I fell in love with the characters and their wholesome friendships, and I grew an even deeper respect for the now much older Joseph and a new found admiration for his absolutely bad ass grandson Jotaro. I can say with all certainty that while I absolutely love Battle Tendency and now in a new light can say I thoroughly enjoyed Phantom Blood, Jojo's Bizarre Adventure doesn't even START until Stardust Crusaders, you wanna understand what makes Jojo what it is? You wanna know what all the hype is about? This is it, this is what shonen anime is all about. Strap yourself in, no one is safe in their path, the Stardust Crusaders are gonna rock your world.",

            "content": "While the first season of Stardust Crusaders was tamed a little bit, the second season went right back off of its meds again.  This has to be the only anime in existence that involves fetuses (yes fetuses), attack falcons that are actually the coolest of the villains, and enough animal mutilation to really make you wonder if the Hirohiko Araki isn't secretly a serial killer with the bodies of children and dogs in his basement. \r\nWhile Stardust Crusaders was definitely flawed, it's an amazing ride that has your mouth agape at moments, clenching your fists at others, and laughing out loud at others.The only problem is, is sometimes you're laughing with the anime, but towards the end, you find yourself laughing at the anime, with it's improbable and unexplainable dues ex machinas.  And these deus ex machinas aren't like the original Jojo, where it was just done for ironic laughs, these were more unfavorable ones used to save characters.  They were a bit ridiculous in the bad way.  But, because they were interspersed with comedy and breakneck speed action, you moved on from it quickly, before you had too much time to think about the logic gaps.   \\n\\n\r\nAnd yes, Jojo is literally famous for logic gaps.  They just really don't care and it's usually funny.  But...\\n\\n\r\n(SPOILER ALERT. WARNING. MASSIVE SPOILER ALERT. DO NOT READ IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE SPOILED!) \\n\\n\r\nPolnareff and Joseph should be dead.  One of the most awesome moments was when you thought Vanilla Ice (LOL) killed Polnareff and the cool way he went out.  But, instead they copped out.  Joseph should be dead, because there's no way that blood transfusion should have brought him back to life like that, but since it did, and he had Dio's blood mixed in, he should have gone vampiric and died in the sun when they were burning Dio's body in the desert, like everyone else who has ever gotten Dio's blood and was out in the Sun.  He should be dead one way or the other.  \\n\\n\r\nBut, no Deus Ex Machina was as ridiculous as the ones they had for Jotaro.  Just, out of nowhere, he suddenly became Son Goku.  Dude is flying, glowing with aura, stopping time, and hell, Dio's Stand punched Kakyoin once and he died.  Jotaro got punched by it so many times, and just kept it moving, even when it showed his bones being shattered. One thing Stardust Crusaders established early was that the injuries are serious and needed time to heal. You can't put people in the hospital for eye injuries and bullet grazes and then just have Jojo shaking off a shattered shoulder, rib cage and multiple stab wounds, one in his head.  Not to mention the 1,001 times Dio could've killed him, but then Jotaro moved a muscle and Dio decided to converse for 30 minutes every single time, instead of just killing him.  I will say the part where Dio was listening for his vital signs was pretty intense, though.  Overall, the time stop thing was kind of a bad idea for Dio's Stand power, since he had to do SO MUCH MONOLOGUING to explain why he didn't just kill Jotaro instantly.  \\n\\n\r\nLogic gaps for days, but that's Jojo.  \\n\\n\r\nIn spite of this, I still loved this anime.  It had great characters, it's funny as hell, full of action and suspense and outlandish moments in almost every episode.  Even with all the logic gaps and copouts in the end, I still highly enjoyed the anime right up unto the finish.  It's one of the most insane and creative animes ever made and is a breathe of fresh air in a world of cookie cutter school dramas and moe harems.  \\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nOverall: 9  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

The DIO fight felt a bit lacking which is a weird thing to say seeing as he literally can stop time for a few seconds at time. Maybe its cause the memes had me spoiled for how this fight went which would mainly be on me and does not subtract from the spectacle of the fight. DIO aside the baddies the stardust crusaders encounter continue to be even more insane than ever and the resolutions to the fights match thatto a T. This OP should be mentioned cause I feel like no JoJo's OP can do wrong but this one really grew on me fast.",

            "content": "Like its first season, Stardust Crusaders Season 2 is a mixed bag that ultimately comes out with more enjoyment than not. The characters arrive in Egypt for a rather spectacular opening battle, easily one of the best of part 3, with the promise of more powerful, clever foes between them and Dio. You get the sense that this will not be as simple as season 1's narrative that boiled down to going from point A to point B episode to episode.\r\nUnfortunately, there's much less going on for the most part. While season 1 had an ongoing narrative regarding the motives of the key minions comingafter the heroes, the first two thirds of the season involve the characters wandering about looking for Dio's lair and happening upon random baddies. That's not to say that this part is unenjoyable. Some of the Stand users aren't too interesting, but for the most part the rest are far more entertaining and creative than the fights in season 1. There's a jump in quality in regards to the individual battles and more inventive applications of a Stand than just being a punch-ghost. The best episodes involve conflicts you'd never expect, like gambling or trying to crawl off of a train track.\\n\\n\r\nThe last third in particular is an extremely exciting gauntlet that brought the show up a whole rating for me. The final showdown is one for the anime history books in terms of presentation, character involvement, and tension. Watching Dio in action is far more entertaining than his minions. His personality is just so much stronger and more dynamic, I'm not even much of a Dio fanboy, but that segment was just plain well done.\\n\\n\r\nAs with last season, Jotaro is not an especially engaging protagonist, though luckily the rest of the cast more than makes up for it with how much more screentime they actually get than the title character. Funnily enough, as the series goes on, we get to see inside of Jotaro's head much more frequently, and it does wonders to make him more fascinating to watch. Seeing him have to come up with plans is genuinely exciting, making it a shame that we didn't get this much earlier.\\n\\n\r\nOf those other characters, Polnareff is both comic relief and the emotional heart of the series in a way. He's practically the main character if you think about how much more involved he is with the battles of the week, which I am fine with. Joseph is not as amazing as he was in Battle Tendency, but every moment he's on screen is precious as always. The characters are the draw of the show, they're always a joy to see interacting.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound quality is fantastic as usual, there's not much to say there that needs to be said. It's gorgeous, the soundtrack is great, and I was never confused by anything's presentation that wasn't intentionally so.\\n\\n\r\nIn summary: the plot is extremely underdeveloped, but the characters are fun enough to make up for it. If you want to watch a bunch of wacky bros on a roadtrip to beat up a vampire, this is for you.",
